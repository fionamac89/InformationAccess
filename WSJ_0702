   MILAN -- Italian media magnate Silvio Berlusconi lost
control of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A. as shareholders
revoked his powers as chairman five months after he took the
helm at Italy's largest publishing group.
   The move was a victory for rival shareholder Carlo De
Benedetti, although the financier didn't assume control of
Mondadori. Shareholders named Giacinto Spizzico, a
representative of the Milan district court, as chairman of
the newly appointed board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The battle for control of the publishing house erupted in
December when the Formenton family revoked a pact with Mr. De
Benedetti and allied itself with Mr. Berlusconi. The
Formentons sold their 25.7% in AME Finanziaria S.p.A.,
Mondadori's parent company, to Mr. Berlusconi even though Mr.
De Benedetti held an option to buy the stake by the end of
January 1991.
   This move gave Mr. Berlusconi, himself a minority
shareholder of AME Finanziaria, majority control of Mondadori
and on Jan. 25, he had himself named chairman. Since then,
the disputed block of shares has been sequestered by the
court, which then took effective control of AME Finanziaria
last month and of Mondadori on Friday.
   Mr. Berlusconi and five representatives of his holding
company, Fininvest, were named to the new board. Mr. De
Benedetti received five seats on the new board, while the
court took four seats.
   The two sides have been negotiating a number of compromise
proposals, including one that calls for the break-up of the
publishing house. But talks have been deadlocked over which
party should get which assets at which price.
   Mondadori publishes Italy's leading daily newspaper, "La
Repubblica," the country's two top-selling weeklies, scores
of magazines, a dozen regional newspapers and some 2,500 book
titles a year. It posted consolidated revenue of around 2.4
trillion lire ($1.95 billion) in 1989.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- PC/Computing, a computer magazine
owned by the Ziff-Davis Publishing Co. unit of Ziff
Communications Co., New York, said it acquired the subscriber
list of Personal Computing, a computer magazine that the
Netherlands-based VNU N.V. is discontinuing.
   Terms weren't disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Personal Computing, which has a paid circulation of more
than 400,000 and which was recently named "best computer
magazine" by the Computer Press Association, said it will
stop publishing after its August issue.
   VNU (United Dutch Publishers) has been systematically
selling off its U.S. magazines in the past three years and
expanding its acquisitions of computer data-based services
for the marketing, legal and financial professions. At one
point, VNU published seven computer and electronic magazines
under VNU Business Publications Inc., based in Hasbrouck
Heights, N.J.
   Personal Computing, founded in 1976, is the last of the
magazines that VNU owned in the U.S. The magazine, which has
changed owners three times since its inception, was acquired
by VNU in 1980.
   With the folding of Personal Computing and the sale of its
subscriber list to Ziff-Davis, Robert J. Lydon, president of
VNU Business Publications and Personal Computing, said he
will leave the company. "Ziff came to us with a very
attractive offer," he said, adding, "In today's increasingly
complex market, we felt our readers and advertisers would be
better served by Ziff's multi-title resources in the computer
field."
   Ziff-Davis also owns PC Magazine, a biweekly computer
magazine, and PC Week, a weekly newspaper. The three
publications combined have 1.2 million readers, the company
said.
   PC/Computing has a paid circulation of more than 500,000.
With the acquisition, PC/Computing will add about 100,000
subscribers to its list. Most of Personal Computing's
circulation will be lost to PC/ Computing, owing to
duplications, lost newsstand sales and the termination of a
bulk subscription from the Pan Am Shuttle, a Northeast
corridor air carrier. PC/ Computing said its product is
already sold in airport newsstands.

   Law -- Washington Docket:
   Jury Discretion Dilemma in Death Cases
   Exemplifies Justice Scalia's Approach

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a
man with a mission: In case after case, he is trying to
rewrite constitutional law as it has evolved over the past
century.
   This isn't a new effort; the 54-year-old conservative has
been pressing for changes in approach to constitutional
provisions for most of his four years on the high court. But
the list of constitutional principles that Justice Scalia
would alter keeps getting longer, and the youthful energy and
intellectual zeal he brings to the task make his colleagues
take notice, even if they have given him little support thus
far.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week, as the court term ended, Justice Scalia added a
new constitutional arrow to his quiver. He said he will no
longer consider prisoners' claims that their death sentences
are unconstitutional because jurors had too little discretion
to consider factors that might persuade them to recommend
life imprisonment rather than execution.
   When the Supreme Court called a halt to capital punishment
in 1972, the justices ruled that imposition of the death
penalty couldn't be left totally to the jury's discretion,
that states must provide some standards and guidance for
jurors. In 1976, the court upheld new death-penalty laws from
several states that limited jury discretion.
   But according to Justice Scalia, in a concurring opinion
last week, a "contradiction" has developed in the court's
death-penalty decisions, which are based on interpretation of
the Eighth Amendment prohibition of "cruel and unusual
punishment." The court, he said, has continued to insist that
jury discretion to impose the death penalty must be limited,
but has simultaneously recognized prisoners' arguments that
the jury didn't have enough discretion to consider
extenuating factors that might have tipped the jury in favor
of imprisonment.
   For death-row inmates, Justice Scalia's decision to reject
all claims based on failure to consider extenuating factors
isn't a big threat, as he has rarely voted in favor of
prisoners' claims.
   Ironically, however, his stance puts him in a somewhat
analogous position to the court's leading liberals, Justices
William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who from the opposite
end of the spectrum have refused to accept the court's 1976
finding that state death-penalty laws were constitutional.
The two dissent in every death-penalty case, arguing that
death sentences are "cruel and unusual punishment."
   Another line of constitutional attack by Justice Scalia
became clearer this term. He said he won't accept the court's
rulings striking down state laws that have the effect of
favoring local businesses while discriminating against
companies based in other states.
   The court bases rulings against such state laws on the
premise that the laws interfere with the free flow of
interstate commerce and that the Constitution gives Congress,
not the states, the power to regulate interstate commerce.
   But Justice Scalia argues that the Constitution gives the
power over commerce only to Congress, and doesn't give the
court the authority to strike down state business laws unless
they directly clash with federal law.
   Each time Justice Scalia unleashes a new constitutional
attack, it stirs up touchy and unsettled questions for his
colleagues, as well as for court observers, about the proper
role of precedent.
   When it comes to constitutional precedent, most justices
agree that they have an individual obligation, secured by
their oath of office, to interpret the Constitution as they
see it, and that it would be wrong to subscribe to
constitutional principles with which they disagree. But, as
retired Justice Lewis Powell warned in a speech last year,
too little respect for constitutional precedents "would
represent explicit endorsement of the idea that the
Constitution is nothing more than what five justices say it
is. This would undermine the rule of law."

   Midyear Increase Is Unusual;
   Firms Cite Weak Sales,
   Fears of `Sticker-Shock'

   DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp.
followed Ford Motor Co.'s lead in an unusual midyear price
increase on most of their cars and some trucks.
   The Big Three auto makers rarely lift prices in midyear.
The last time GM did so was 1986. But the moves, in response
to Ford's action on June 18, reflect a desire by the Big
Three to increase revenues hurt by weak sales and to mitigate
possible "sticker-shock" when they announce prices on this
fall's 1991 models. When 1990 models debuted last year, their
far-higher sticker prices drove many buyers away, causing a
longlasting sales slump.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   GM, Ford and Chrysler also were emboldened to raise prices
because their stocks of unsold cars are far leaner this year
than last year as they head into summer and the end of the
1990 model year. GM dealers, for example, had a 62-day supply
of unsold cars at the end of May compared with a 72-day
supply a year earlier. Chrysler had a low 56-day supply,
compared with a 67-day supply.
   Still, Chrysler has struggled with slow sales this year,
causing some dealers to worry about the $60 to $160 price
increases Chrysler announced Friday on most of its cars and
some trucks. The No. 3 auto maker also raised destination
charges on some of its vehicles by $15 or $30. Chrysler said
it was taking the step because of "increased operating and
product costs."
   GM also is raising prices on a variety of vehicles by $66
to $369. In addition, GM is raising destination charges for
all cars and trucks by $10. GM said it made the moves to
"partially offset higher raw materials, labor and health
costs."
   GM officials said the company's prices overall rose an
average of $83 a vehicle, or five-tenths of one percent.
Chrysler didn't provide an overall average increase.
   The Chrysler and GM increases are effective today. Ford's
price hikes ranged from $58 to $134 on many cars and trucks.
   Even though the increases might seem modest, some Chrysler
dealers fear any boost could scare away marginal buyers.
That's something Chrysler can ill afford because its combined
car and truck sales through May were off 14.8% from a year
ago, while its share of the U.S. car market for May dropped
to 9.7% from 10.9%.
   But May was still an improvement over April's 7.8% share.
Analysts said the uptick gave Chrysler a window of
opportunity to generate more revenue. "Chrysler's share among
domestic car makers has bounced back recently and there
hasn't been that much deterioration in sales, so they thought
they could get away with a slight increase," said David
Healy, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd investment
banking arm of Barclays Group.
   Chrysler said its smallest increase of $60 comes on the
Dodge Daytona, which started at $9,745, and on most Chrysler
LeBaron models. The $160 boost affects Chrysler Fifth Avenue,
which started at $20,860 and Imperial, which started at
$25,495.
   Prices of Chrysler's minivans will each increase $118,
except for the Chrysler Town &amp; Country version, which will
cost $125 more. Chrysler's least expensive minivan previously
started at $11,995.
   Chrysler isn't raising prices of its least-expensive
domestic cars, the Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow or on
two of its slowest-selling cars the Eagle Premier and Dodge
Monaco.
   The No. 3 domestic auto maker didn't release any
information about price increases on Jeeps models. But
dealers said base prices on Cherokee, Wagoneer and Grand
Wagoneer jumped an average of $103.
   GM slapped its biggest price increase of $369 on the 1991
Chevrolet S/T Blazer two-door truck. The truck's price prior
to the move was $12,966. The No. 1 auto maker also added $220
to the price of the 1991 Caprice Classic, which had cost
$15,125.
   The lowest price increases of $65 primarily affected the
1990-model GM-10 cars: Chevrolet Lumina, Buick Regal,
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix. The weak
sales of the midsized cars have disappointed GM officials who
expected the GM-10s to constitute the heart of GM's lineup.

   Dollar Is Expected to Rise Against Mark
   In July Due to Effects of German Union

   The dollar is expected to show gains against the mark in
July, but remain steady against the yen, according to
economists and traders.
   But the "German question," of whether West Germany can
swallow East Germany without indigestion, likely won't be
answered until late summer, they say. They do believe the
mark will survive, but they say it won't be without a fight.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the end of July, the dollar will gain three pfennigs to
1.691 marks, according to the average forecast of 10
economists and traders in New York, London, Frankfurt and
Tokyo surveyed by Dow Jones International News Service on the
eve of the German economic and monetary union, which was
completed yesterday. The average forecast for the end of
September is 1.712 marks to the dollar.
   The dollar-yen exchange rate is expected to remain
exceptionally steady, while the dollar is seen rising against
the British pound and the Swiss franc, in part because the
latter currencies are expected to shadow the mark's
movements. The dollar is forecast at 154.30 yen at the end of
July and 153.40 yen at the end of September.
   Late Friday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6610
marks, below 1.6730 marks late Thursday, and at 152.20 yen,
below 153.15 yen late Thursday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading
at 152.15 yen; it closed Friday in Tokyo at 152.85 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6574
marks, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.6713 marks.
   On Friday, Ingo Kuller, chief trader at Westdeutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale in Duesseldorf, cast the two most
bullish projections for the dollar against the mark in the
belief that the dollar remains undervalued against the mark
and is overdue for a rally.
   Since the Berlin Wall was breached on Nov. 9, the dollar
has risen about 10% against the mark, with most of the gains
made in the first three months.
   Mr. Kuller cautioned, however, that the effects of
monetary union with East Germany make all forecasts
extraordinarily difficult. "Who knows how the markets are
going to react to monetary union?" Mr. Kuller mused, voicing
a common uncertainty.
   Ernst Pullmann, chief trader for Deutsche Girozentrale
Deutsche Kommunalbank in Frankfurt, said the uncertainties
and surprises coming out of East Germany "won't have as large
an impact as some people think." Mr. Pullmann expects the
mark to resume its long-term ascent as the summer progresses.
   Japanese investors, Mr. Pullmann predicted, "will show up
as much stronger investors," he said. "The Japanese are going
to need marks to invest in East Germany. The recent firmness
of the yen against the mark will prove to be only temporary."
   The key question in economists' minds is how East Germans
will react to having their pockets full of West German marks.
The conversion of East German currency to West German
currency boosted the money supply by about 10% overnight, and
some believe East Germans will go on a buying spree, spurring
inflation. One U.S. foreign exchange dealer evoked the image
of kids in a candy store.
   Many economists, however, say the prospect of massive
unemployment in East Germany will spur more saving than
spending.
   Analysts who focused on interest rates were in agreement
that German rates aren't headed down, while U.S. rates quite
possibly are.
   The wild card in the U.S. rate-easing scenario, according
to Jerry Egan, chief dealer at the Bank of Boston, is the
release Friday of U.S. employment data for June. "If the
employment data show a weak number, there will be a lot more
talk about easing," Mr. Egan said, but he doubted whether the
Federal Reserve would make a move before autumn.
   Impetus for a looser monetary policy could also come from
an ambitious deficit-reduction proposal, which U.S.
negotiators promised their Japanese counterparts in trade
talks completed last week in return for Japanese concessions.
U.S. President George Bush, in a news conference Friday, said
a deficit-reduction pact likely would speed economic growth
despite any new taxes, paving the way for the Federal Reserve
to ease interest rates.
   Most of the survey's respondents said the dollar's
exchange rates with sterling and the Swiss franc will be
dominated by those currencies' relationships with the mark.
   At the end of June, the average forecast put the pound at
$1.7160, below $1.7485 late Friday in New York. In 90 days,
the pound is expected to be worth $1.6975.
   "Always think in terms of the cross," said Eric Nickerson,
vice president and economist at Bank of America in San
Francisco. "The sterling-dollar is going to fall more out of
the cross than from any mood regarding sterling-dollar
directly," he said. The reason is sterling's probable entry
in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary
System (EMS) this year.
   Geoffrey Dennis, an economist with James Capel &amp; Co. Ltd.,
said sterling's strength rests "almost solely" with the
market's perception that Britain is about to put the pound
inside the ERM.
   The pound now ranges close to where the market thinks
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wants it to enter the ERM,
leading some observers to believe the entry will come as
early as July and no later than October.
   The Swiss franc is seen slipping against the dollar but
gaining on the mark. In 30 days, the forecast calls for the
dollar to trade at 1.4318 francs, above 1.4150 francs late
Friday in New York. In 90 days, the dollar would trade at
1.4490 francs, the survey predicted.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery jumped $5.80 to $357.90 an ounce. It was the
highest close since June 5. Estimated volume was a moderate
3.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $357.45 an
ounce.

   Nominal sales also increased 7% from a year earlier,
reflecting the steadiness of wholesale prices during the
year.

   TORONTO -- Holders of Dylex Ltd. approved the
authorization of a new class of convertible preferred shares
that could be used instead of cash to pay off 150 million
Canadian dollars (US$128.4 million) of debentures
outstanding.
   Holders of the 9.25% debentures can retract them at 110%
of their face value in 1992. The retailing company can ill
afford such a cash outlay. Dylex had losses of C$10.5 million
for the quarter ended May 5 and C$60.7 million for the fiscal
year ended Feb. 3. But the company has the option of
substituting the new securities for cash.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wilfred Posluns, chairman and chief executive officer,
said Dylex nevertheless would like to avoid issuing the newly
authorized shares, because they could dilute the company's
widely held Class A nonvoting shares, into which the
preferred would be convertible.
   He said Dylex might consider raising cash through the sale
of a division or real estate, share issues by a division, or
borrowing against real estate. But he said no specific plans
had been made for any of these measures.
   In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dylex
Class A shares closed unchanged at C$3.95 (US$3.38).

   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered ratings
on about $1 billion of Charter Medical Corp.'s high-yield,
high-risk junk bonds. The ratings firm cited volatility in
demand for pyschiatric services and Charter's possible
difficulties in refinancing debt.
   Moody's reduced Charter's senior debt ratings to
single-B-2 from single-B-1, and its subordinated and junior
subordinated debentures to Caa from single-B-3. In addition,
Moody's lowered Charter's preferred stock rating to Ca from
single-B-3, and affirmed Charter's senior subordinated debt
at single-B-3. Last March, Moody's had placed all of
Charter's credit ratings under review for possible downgrade.

   Charter, based in Macon, Ga., is one of the largest
operators of psychiatric hospitals in the U.S. and also
operates 13 general hospitals. A Charter spokesman declined
to comment on the dowgrades, except to say, "We're very
positive" about the company's prospects.
   Moody's said Charter's lower credit quality relates to its
"limited prospects for a rebound in profitability, to the
newly demonstrated potential for volatility in demand for
psychiatric services, and to the increased risk facing highly
leveraged companies with refinancing needs."
   The ratings firm concluded, "Plans to reduce construction
of new hospitals will increase discretionary cash flow
through 1992. However, meeting future years' bank debt
amortization obligations is likely to require external
sourcing of funds which Moody's believes represents higher
risk for the company in the present financial environment."

   WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes rose a slight 0.4% in May
after declining for five months, but still failed to spark
any optimism about the strength of the housing industry.
   "The number is up an undistinguishable amount from the
past declines," said Martin Regalia, chief economist for the
National Council of Savings Institutions in Washington.
"These numbers are really indications of a housing
recession."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the report, the Housing and Urban Development and
Commerce Departments said new single-family homes were sold
at an annual rate of 532,000 in May. Sales had declined 5.2%
in April to a 530,000 pace, and they dropped 7.8% in March to
a 559,000 clip.
   "The slight increase in May isn't something to cheer
about," said Gary Ciminero, chief economist for Fleet/Norstar
Financial Group in Washington. "I'd say we're still wallowing
around as far as new housing sales are concerned . . . I
expect the downward trend to continue."
   Most economists agree that the May report reflects the
recessionary state of the housing sector and they predicted
further drops in housing prices as a result.
   "Home-sale prices will have to decline to reduce the glut
of unsold homes," said Mr. Ciminero. "We're already starting
to see some decline in home-sale prices, particularly in the
Northeast. Once we get some reliable data that's up to date
we might see some more regional declines."
   New homes in the Northeast were sold at an annual rate of
84,000 in May, down from the 94,000 rate in April and the
86,000 pace in March. The South also experienced a decline,
with new homes sold at an annual rate of 199,000 in May
compared to 201,000 in April. New-home sales were up from the
previous month in both the Midwest and the West.
   However, housing numbers are generally regarded as
imprecise and are subject to significant revisions. All
numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

   Salt Lake City businessman Jon M. Huntsman received
federal approval to acquire up to 15% of troubled Ferro
Corp., a much-rumored takeover candidate last year, sending
Ferro stock surging $4.375 to $25.50 in heavy New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Friday.
   Brent Stevenson, president of Huntsman Holdings Inc., said
Mr. Huntsman didn't intend in the short term, either alone or
with someone else, to exercise control of Cleveland-based
Ferro.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Stevenson said Mr. Huntsman already has an undisclosed
equity position in Ferro, which has 19.4 million common
shares outstanding.
   Ferro, which makes specialty chemicals, specialty ceramics
and engineered plastics, declined to comment. Earlier this
year, Mr. Huntsman failed to acquire another plastics-related
company, Aristech Chemical Corp., Pittsburgh.
   Separately, Ferro said it expects second-quarter earnings
to be "substantially lower" than the $13.1 million, or 87
cents a share, it earned a year earlier. The company's
first-quarter earnings plunged to $6 million, or 26 cents a
share, from $12.3 million, or 60 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Ferro said it expects second-quarter results to be better
than they were in the first quarter. It attributed its
problems to economic conditions in Latin America,
particularly Brazil, start-up costs for a new chemicals
operation in France, and sluggish demand in the automotive
market.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- The Gallery:
   Impressive Impressionists

   Washington, D.C. -- As art prices rise, so does interest
in collectors of art. This has been reflected in a number of
recent museum exhibitions devoted to private collections,
many of which specialize in pricey late 19th-century
paintings.
   The most recent of these is "The Passionate Eye:
Impressionist and Other Master Paintings From the Collection
of Emil G. Buhrle," which will be at the East Wing of the
National Gallery of Art until July 15.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This is an impressive exhibition, which brings together 85
pictures from both the E.G. Buhrle Foundation and the Buhrle
family private collection.
   It is well worth a trip to Washington, since these
paintings are not expected to travel again after this show
completes its tour and there are some real gems here.
   Moreover, until Aug. 5 the West Wing of the National
Gallery is hosting another temporarily peripatetic first-rate
private collection, "Masterpieces of Impressionism and
Post-Impressionism: The Annenberg Collection" (reviewed in
these pages last Aug. 4).
   Although the main strength of the Buhrle collection is in
its modern paintings, it also includes some lovely old
masterworks. One of the most impressive of these is G.B.
Tiepolo's "Diana Bathing" (circa 1755-60), a theatrical
composition of frolicking female nudes that is as lush and
sensuous as a Boucher.
   There also are some lovely landscapes. Aelbert Cuyp's
"Thunderstorm over Dordrecht" (c. 1645) is dominated by a
brooding sky streaked with magnificently rendered lightning,
and two evocatively detailed views of Venice by Canaletto
nearly transport you to the place itself.
   The modern paintings are divided into two sections, one
exhibited in the softly lit lower galleries and the other in
the brighter galleries upstairs. This produces a curious
effect. Although some of the artists, such as Monet, are
represented in both places, the pictures in the downstairs
galleries look more "old master" -- like as a result of the
warmer lighting, while the pictures upstairs seem a bit more
brash.
   The taste behind the Buhrle collection is a very
particular one, preferring toughminded, somewhat austere
works. A number of the pictures have offbeat subjects.
Manet's "La Sultane" (1871) is a frankly sensual portrayal of
a plump, rather melancholy prostitute dressed in diaphanous
Middle Eastern garb.
   A little further on, the same painter's sketchily rendered
"The Suicide" (1881) is morbidly haunting. Toulouse-Lautrec's
"The Two Friends" (1895) is an unusually forthright
representation of two lesbians making love. And his majestic
"Messaline" (1900), painted while he was recovering from a
severe breakdown, is a chillingly somber, almost funereal
evocation of an operetta about the Emperor Claudius's
nymphomaniac wife.
   The collection also contains a number of stunning
Cezannes, including the mysteriously brooding "Boy in the Red
Vest" (1890) and the sonorously austere "SelfPortrait With
Palette" (1890), one of Cezanne's greatest representations of
himself.
   There also are a half-dozen powerful van Goghs, three of
which are truly sublime. A superb variation of the "Sower"
(1888) balances the dark silhouettes of a striding man and a
bowing tree against a sky the color of hammered gold. In the
tumultuous "Wheat Field With Cypresses" (1889), the whole
ensemble is tossed and tumbled by an apocalyptic wind. The
lyrical "Blossoming Chestnut Branches" (1890), by contrast,
is a paragon of almost other worldly serenity.
   If the 20th-century paintings are not of the same high
quality, there nevertheless are some wonders, such as
Kandinsky's poetic "Blue Rider" (1903) and two Braques, one a
brightly colored fauve landscape, the other a mysteriously
suggestive cubist work.
   Both the Buhrle and Annenberg collections are accompanied
by well-illustrated and informative but tellingly different
catalogs. While the Annenberg catalog focuses solely on the
collection, the Buhrle catalog pays much attention to the
collector. In fact, the show is billed as a commemoration "of
the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Swiss
industrialist and collector Emil G. Buhrle."
   Nothing wrong with this, you might say, as you thumb
through the lengthy essay about the collector and glance at
the photographs of him, his family, his friends, his house,
his factory. For neither the catalog nor any of the other
printed matter that accompanies it bothers to point out that
the man being lionized here was blacklisted in 1945 for
delivering arms to the Germans during World War II, and that
his son Dietrich, who succeeded him in the business, later
lost his commission in the Swiss Army, as a convicted felon,
for illegal arms sales.
   Now while it is perfectly legitimate to exhibit such a
man's collection, it seems to me downright tasteless to
sanctify him the way this catalog does. I do not mean to
suggest that only works of art that have belonged to
blameless men should be shown in museums. (Since, among other
reasons, this would not leave much to show.) But I do think
that when museums present such collections, they might take
their cue from Walter Annenberg. Though he might not win many
popularity contests, he at least has had the good taste to
keep his collection and his private life separate, and to
refrain from using the one to justify the other.
   After it leaves Washington, the Buhrle collection will be
seen at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Aug. 3-Oct. 14; the
Yokohama Museum of Art, Nov. 2-Jan. 13, 1991; and the Royal
Academy of Arts, London, Feb. 1-April 9, 1991. The Annenberg
collection will be seen at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, Aug. 16-Nov. 11; and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
New York, May-September 1991.

   The Franco-German Entente Looks Simple, But Isn't

   Once when I was driving along the Autobahn in a rented car
with French license plates, a German driver roared past and
turned around to shake his fist. Puzzling over what this
hostile act could mean, I finally concluded that the German
must have thought I was French.
   If the German-French relationship is touchy, history can
supply reasons. Of all national rivalries throughout time,
this one has been among those costing the most blood. World
War I, that terrible and senseless slaughter pitting France
and Germany as the central protagonists, was in part
attributable to the bitterness still lingering after France's
defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. The rise of
Hitler and the onset of World War II was in turn attributable
in part to the harsh reparation and disarmament terms imposed
on Germany after World War I, mainly at the insistence of
France's Georges Clemenceau.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even among intelligent and enlightened Germans and
Frenchmen -- and after 45 years of peace -- a bit of
nationalist choler occasionally bubbles up during political
discussions. Although the French maintain a close cooperative
liaison with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, they
have chosen to keep their military forces free of NATO's
joint command.
   Which makes it all the more interesting that West
Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and French President
Francois Mitterrand have lately become the Tweedledum and
Tweedledee of Europe. At the summit gathering of heads of
state of the 12 European Community nations in Dublin a week
ago, they made common cause against Britain's Margaret
Thatcher, a lady regarded by the one as "ein grosser
kopfschmerz" and the other as "un grand mal de tete". In
other words, she is a headache for both.
   The French and Germans were united in Dublin, at least
superficially, on aid to the Soviet Union, creation of a
single European currency and EC political union. But Mrs.
Thatcher demurred on all three, knowing that the
French-German entente was not strong enough to overwhelm her.
   Mr. Mitterrand gave his imprimatur to German unification
last year well before the Berlin Wall came down. The Germans
were grateful but the French president knew that opposition
would cost him more than he could gain. When the
German-Polish border issue came up, however, he played
hardball with the Germans and won, helping force the Germans
to guarantee the existing border. Some Germans were
resentful, but to little avail.
   On the other hand, French-German monetary cooperation has
worked well for both sides. The French have for some years
now kept their franc in step with the strong deutsche mark,
and have benefited enormously. Paris -- "voila]" -- suddenly
has become an interesting financial center. French inflation
has been modest. There is no evidence at all that French
industry has suffered from having a hard currency, a lesson
that Britain seems to have great trouble grasping.
   This successful monetary partnership, based on the
solidity of a Bundesbank that enjoys significant political
independence, has helped strengthen Franco-German ties. It
also has hampered Mrs. Thatcher, who can't seem to get
inflation under control, in trying to bring her influence to
bear on the question of creating a European central bank and
a common European currency. She nonetheless had some success
in Dublin by offering a transitory step toward a single
currency, one that would not disturb national monetary
sovereignty. It calls for creating a "hard ECU" for public
use, thereby testing the market response to a single
currency. If acceptance will get England into the EC money
system, the others may buy it.
   But the big issue in the EC is something called "political
union," and it is in this area that the seeming Franco-German
comity is the most interesting -- and in some sense, most
implausible. When a BBC interviewer asked British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd if a summit decision to convene a
constitutional conference in Rome Dec. 15 meant the EC was
heading toward political union, he seemed surprised at her
credulity. The foreign secretary wanted to know if she really
believed that Mr. Mitterrand was prepared to surrender his
control over French foreign and security policy. The EC
countries probably will continue to do what they do now, he
said, taking common positions on the things they can agree
about and national positions on those that they can't.
   Which brings us again to the Franco-German entente and its
focus on political unification. It is precisely because of a
long history of emnity that the French and Germans have a
common interest in European political unity. That is not the
same thing as unification, but it more precisely defines what
Messrs. Kohl and Mitterrand have in mind. Both know -- and
have known for some time -- that activation of the
German-German economic treaty today would represent de facto
German reunification. Germany now has potential to be a major
political power in addition to what it already is, the
dominant economic power in Europe. Both leaders want to make
sure this does not disturb the peaceful relationships that
have been built so painstakingly and successfully since World
War II. The Germans don't want a suspicious Europe making
common cause against Germany. The French don't want a new
rise of German nationalism that might threaten France.
   The EC and NATO are the answers to those fears. So long as
Germany is part of an integrated Europe there can be a great
deal of assurance -- even if not absolute -- that it will not
attempt to follow an independent course in foreign policy.
That there will be deviations, of course, was suggested at
the summit, where Mr. Kohl displayed much frustration with a
reluctance among his EC partners to come up with an aid
package for the Soviet Union. Germany has more important
reasons than the others for wanting to round up money for the
Soviets. It wants to induce the Soviets to pull their 360,000
troops out of Germany as quickly as possible without
conditions. The Soviets want money and the Germans want to
give it to them, but preferably with other Europeans chipping
in.
   In short, the nations of Europe always will have certain
foreign policy interests that cannot be reduced to a common
EC policy. The same goes for domestic policy, but perhaps to
a lesser extent. But Herr Kohl and M. Mitterrand are trying
to make sure that the interests of their two countries do not
diverge in any way that might reawaken the nationalistic
demons of the past. It is a constructive effort and even
though it sometimes yields up rhetorical fantasies about the
potential for political union, it offers strong hope that
Europe will achieve enough unity to avoid repeating the
darkest moments of its history.

   NEW YORK -- Fairfield-Noble Corp. said that it
discontinued operations and that its lenders have foreclosed
on its loans.
   The maker and seller of sportswear for women and girls
blamed a tumultous retail environment and the company's
failure to obtain financing for its decision last Friday to
close. A spokesman wouldn't elaborate.

   Fairfield-Noble, which went public in 1969, consisted of
its Lloyd Williams and Cathy Hardwick divisions. The company
closed the Cathy Hardwick unit during the fiscal year that
ended June 30, 1989, for which it had a net loss of $5.9
million, on $24.5 million in sales.
   According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
the company in fiscal 1989 violated its loan agreement with
Chase Manhattan Bank, but it didn't default; if it had,
Fairfield-Noble said in SEC filings, it would have been
unable to continue operations.
   According to SEC filings, Fairfield-Noble at Sept. 30,
1989, had assets of $5.9 million and a net worth, or assets
minus liabilities, of $11,000. It had 2.3 million shares
outstanding. Two principals, Hy Rabin and Clarence Scaduto,
controlled 45.2% of the company's stock. As of June 30, 1989,
Fairfield-Noble had a total of 2,400 shareholders.

   New AT&amp;T System May Sharply Boost
   Capacity of Marine Transmission Cables

   NEW YORK -- AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories researchers said they
have designed a fiber-optic transmission system to send high
volumes of communications traffic over huge distances without
costly signal regeneration equipment.
   The system combines a new kind of optical glass fiber
containing the rare-earth erbium with pump lasers developed
by Bell Labs two years ago to exploit the science of
solitons, or low-resistance waves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the new system is still several years from
commercialization, scientists at American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.'s research and development unit said it should
greatly benefit undersea cable systems, potentially expanding
capacity by a factor of 10 and cutting costs by a similar
amount.
   "This {new system} has got a lot of us really excited,"
said Jack M. Sipress, director of undersea systems at Bell
Labs. "Our research has shown that we can get a {light} pulse
across the ocean with no conversion equipment, {turning} the
cable into a hollow pipe that's capable of handling greater
amounts of traffic."
   The current trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable, called
TAT-8, costs about $350 million and is capable of carrying
40,000 phone conversations simultaneously at 280 million
bits-per-second (megabits). Next year, a TAT-9 system will go
into operation with the capacity to carry 80,000 calls
simultaneously at 560 megabits. The new system offers
capacity of 700,000 simultaneous phone calls and transmission
capacity of five billion bits-per-second, said Mr. Sipress.
Systems offering such capacity will be necessary in the
future to handle an expected huge increase in video
transmissions, as well as in voice and data traffic.
   However, Mr. Sipress cautioned that the work led by
scientist Linn F. Mollenauer must still undergo several more
years of rigorous testing, including field trials, before
future AT&amp;T transmission systems can incorporate the new
design. But "this lays the foundation for engineering actual
systems," he said.
   In today's optical cable systems, signals sent by laser
light pulses deteriorate over long distances due to the glass
fiber's refractive qualities. To keep the signal active,
optical cable systems such as the trans-Atlantic cable must
use a chain of electrical/electronic repeaters inserted at
intervals of 50 to 80 kilometers along the fiber cable. Each
repeater takes the weakened signal from a laser located at
the end of the cable and electrically amplifies it before
regenerating the signal via laser and sending it on to the
next repeater in the chain.
   While the system of repeaters works, it's inefficient
because it creates choke points for signals that originate
and terminate on either end of the cable, which in the case
of submarine cables are located on shore, said Mr. Sipress.
These repeaters are difficult and costly to repair especially
if the fix must be made in mid-ocean.
   AT&amp;T's new system may change all of this. Erbium's unique
luminescent properties provide optical gain in regions of the
fiber through which signals are transmitted and where there
is the least optical loss. Pump lasers, developed by Bell
Laboratories in 1988 by Mr. Mollenauer, amplify "soliton"
optical communications pulses so that they maintain their
shape over long distances.
   Mr. Mollenauer discovered that when an erbium-laced fiber
is attached to the end of a standard glass fiber at 25-30
kilometer intervals along with a pump laser, the erbium-doped
pieces act as natural signal boosters, eliminating the need
for expensive electrical conversion equipment. Recently, he
used the system in his laboratory to transmit signals 10,000
kilometers with no electrical conversion. That's more than
double the record-breaking 4,000 kilometers over which Mr.
Mollenauer transmitted a light pulse two years ago, using
only soliton pump lasers.
   "The impact of this in terms of new equipment is five
years away, at least," said Richard Mack, an analyst at
Kessler Marketing Intelligence Corp., Newport, R.I. "But it's
a significant advance."
   High-capacity systems such as the one designed by Mr.
Mollenauer is the latest in a series of fiber-optic
breakthroughs to come out of Bell Labs this year. Earlier,
the company demonstrated an optical switch that will be the
basis for future super high-capacity switching systems
capable of handling voice, data and video traffic from
high-speed optical systems with no electronic intervention.

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   Hasbro Inc., citing cautious ordering by retailers and the
close-out of a major toy line, said it expects to report an
earnings skid of more than 50% for the second quarter, on a
10% drop in revenue.
   The gloomy forecast by Hasbro, the nation's leading toy
maker, underscores the general sluggishness in the toy
industry. The continued popularity of video games and growing
sales of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, made by Playmates Toys
Inc., have especially hurt companies that make toys for boys.
And only a couple of major companies that make girls' toys,
Mattel Inc. and Tyco Toys Inc., are expected to post healthy
sales gains.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also, some hot-selling toys have cooled, and retailers
aren't as keen on toys linked to new movies, says Eugene
Gilligan, editor of Playthings, a trade magazine.
   The share earnings drop predicted by Hasbro were
especially surprising because analysts had been expecting
flat earnings on a sales increase of perhaps 3%.
   Hasbro Chairman Alan G. Hassenfeld said net income
declined to 12 cents to 14 cents a share in the quarter from
$18.2 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
fell to about $270 million from $301.4 million. The second
half "looks more hopeful," he said, although he still expects
Hasbro's 1990 earnings to equal last year's $92.2 million, or
$1.56 a share. Revenue will be "flat or increase modestly,"
compared with $1.41 billion in 1989.
   Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., noticed a conservative
trend in orders beginning in April, with retailers apparently
concerned about stocking too many new and unproven products.
Mr. Hassenfeld also noted that some troubled retailers have
cut back on orders. Ames Department Stores Inc., which filed
for bankruptcy protection in April, purchased about $35
million worth of toys last year from Hasbro. This year,
orders from Ames will be to $2 million to $2.5 million. "It
isn't easy to replace $35 million in revenue just like that,"
Mr. Hassenfeld said.
   Contributing to Hasbro's woes are the weakening sales of
two mainstays, G.I. Joe and Transformers. Sales of both have
been hurt by the hot-selling Ninja Turtles: Playmate
officials expect Turtles sales this year to double from last
year's $100 million level. Another disappointment for Hasbro
has been Record Breakers, a line of race cars, which is being
discontinued.
   The company said business is down in its Playskool, Milton
Bradley and Hasbro Toys divisions, but that has been offset
in part by double-digit sales increases in its international
division.
   On a more optimistic note, Hasbro said two toy lines
introduced in limited quantities this summer are selling
well, World Wrestling Federation figures of professional
wrestlers and Baby Uh-Oh, a doll that dirties its diapers.
Cabbage Patch dolls, purchased by Hasbro last year from
Coleco Industries Inc., are also doing a brisk business. And
the company has high hopes for its long-anticipated New Kids
on the Block dolls, fashioned after members of the popular
rock band.
   Things aren't much cheerier for other toy makers. Lewis
Galoob Toys Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., has sputtered
because of slowing sales of Micro Machines, its line of
mini-cars, and other items.
   John Taylor, analyst for L.H. Alton &amp; Co., anticipates
Galoob will report a second-quarter loss of about 50 cents a
share on sales of $35 million to $45 million. That compares
to a profit of 45 cents a share on $56.1 million in sales a
year earlier.
   Mr. Taylor, who had expected Galoob to post a profit of 13
cents a share for the quarter, revised his projection when
told of the growing inventory of Micro Machines in toy
stores. Micro Machines last year accounted for about 70% of
Galoob's sales.
   Tonka Corp., Minnetonka, Minn., could report a quarterly
loss of 25 cents to 50 cents a share, predicts Robin Young,
an analyst at John G. Kinnard &amp; Co., vs. a profit of one cent
a share a year ago. Mr. Young thinks Tonka's sales will fall
16% to about $160 million from $189 million.
   The decline has come amid Tonka's inability to come up
with hot new toys to replace fading hits like Ghostbusters.
Tonka's total orders as of June 3 had declined 11.6% to $657
million from $743 million a year earlier. Excluding orders
for Sega video games, which the company has stopped
distributing, orders have fallen 7.4% to $651 million from
$703 million.
   Two toy firms which expect to post healthy gains for the
quarter make girls' toys, which skirt direct competition with
video games and the Turtles.
   Mattel, the Hawthorne, Calif.-based maker of Barbie, will
report second-quarter profit of 40 cents a share, up from 33
cents a year earlier, estimates Barry Rothberg, analyst for
Mabon Nugent &amp; Co. Sales are expected to rise about 20% to
$325 million from $272.3 million, largely because of Barbie's
continued success.
   Tyco Toys, Mt. Laurel, N.J., also is gaining sales on the
popularity of three dolls, Oopsie Daisy, My Pretty Ballerina
and Quints. Sales are expected to jump nearly 40% to about
$100 million from $71.7 million in the 1989 second quarter.
   But analysts expect Tyco's profits to only equal the 48
cents it posted in last year's second quarter because its
63%-owned Nasta International Inc. unit has forecast a loss
for the year.
   Among toy retailers, Toys "R" Us Inc., is the exception.
While many discounters and toy chains have held back on new
orders, Toys "R" Us "hasn't been bashful about building
inventory," notes Dorothy Lakner, analyst for Deutsche Bank
Capital. Ms. Lakner estimates that Toys "R" Us second-quarter
earnings will increase 25% to 10 cents a share from eight
cents a share a year ago, restated for a stock split, on a
sales gain of about 22%.

   LOS ANGELES -- Hotel Investors Trust cut its quarterly
dividend to 13 cents from 25 cents a share, payable Aug. 1 to
shareholders of record July 10.
   The shares of Hotel Investors Trust, a real estate
investment trust, and Hotel Investors Corp., a hotel
management company, are paired for trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. The stock rose 12.5 cents Friday to close at
$4.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The companies are in the process of selling most of their
assets, and have retained Salomon Bros. Inc. to review a
possible sale of two Las Vegas, Nev., casino hotels. As
previously announced, the companies have agreed to sell 31
hotels to Park Plaza Inc., an affiliate of EIE International
Corp. of Japan.
   Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors Corp. reported a
combined loss of $60.4 million, or $4.97 a share, for 1989.
The loss included a $55.8 million reserve for the planned
sale of certain properties.
   The two companies said their boards have adopted
amendments to the trustees' regulations and corporation
bylaws concerning the conduct of shareholder meetings. A
company spokeswoman said the changes include the
clarification of rules on shareholder proposals being
presented to the boards.

   Reality: Many Copy Rolling Stone Ad

   Pat Fallon, whose ad agency created it, calls it among the
most "ripped-off campaigns in the history of the business."
He isn't far from wrong.
   A radio station, a car company and a handful of magazines
all have copied the campaign. So have a graphics house, an
electronics company and one of the Baby Bells.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In all, well over a dozen recent campaigns look awfully
familiar. In fact, at first glance they look almost exactly
like the "Perception/Reality" ad campaign that Mr. Fallon's
Minneapolis ad agency, Fallon McElligott, first created for
Rolling Stone magazine five years ago. That long-running
campaign pairs people's "perception" of the magazine -- a
picture of a hippy, a pig or a pair of granny glasses -- with
the "reality" -- a photo of a yuppie, a policeman or a pair
of Ray Bans.
   For a "creative" industry, the ad business sure doesn't
seem too long on originality. Just as prime-time television
seems to endlessly reproduce itself, with one season
chock-full of detective shows and the next crammed with legal
dramas, the ad business can't get enough of a good thing. A
few years ago, every other TV commercial seemed to be filmed
in that black-and-white, shaky-camera style popularized by
director Leslie Dektor. In print, the one to follow is
clearly Rolling Stone.
   Not that anyone admits to copying the distinctive-looking
ad. Consider a current Field &amp; Stream magazine ad picturing a
pair of Cole-Haan yuppie loafers on one side and a pair of
Wolverine duck boots on the other. The ad "is trying to
change a perception" that all the magazine's readers are "low
income, low education, low interest," says Steve Crane of
Perri, Debes, Looney &amp; Crane, the Rochester, N.Y., ad agency
that created it.
   Yet Mr. Crane is quick to add, "We didn't set out to knock
off `Perception/Reality.' It definitely isn't derivative, as
much as it may look that way."
   The "Perception/Reality" format has spread to almost every
other conceivable product, too. A graphics design firm in
California copied the ad almost exactly, noting in the fine
print that it is perceived as "only a stat house. In reality,
it is the one place where you can go for all your graphic
needs." A Los Angeles radio station ad shows a pair of
sneakers on the left and a pair of ladies' pumps on the right
to prove that, contrary to perception, "working women love"
the station.
   Bill Miller, the Fallon copywriter who helped originate
the campaign, says he runs across at least one new knockoff a
month. Some don't copy the "Perception/Reality" line
outright, but look suspiciously similar anyway, including
current ads from Bell Atlantic Yellow pages and Siemens, the
big electronics firm. Spokesmen at both say that despite the
perception, the reality is that they didn't ape the Rolling
Stone campaign on purpose.
   Some ads, on the other hand, have quite intentionally been
copycats. Volkswagen actually received permission from
Rolling Stone for its "Perception/Reality" ad showing a '60s
Bug on one page vs. VW's current lineup on the other. But
Soap Opera Digest was slapped with a "cease and desist"
letter when it tried a similar parody, without permission, in
1988. Its ad looked exactly like Rolling Stone's
"Perception/Reality" campaign -- but under both captions, it
showed the same frumpy housewife pushing a grocery cart with
fat kids in tow.
   Rolling Stone has sent a handful of warning letters to
other pretenders, but has yet to take further legal steps.
Felix Kent, Fallon's New York lawyer, says the ads now
include a copyright notice but enforcement is difficult. "No
one has an exclusive right to a concept," he says, adding,
"Whenever you have a successful campaign, others try to rip
it off."
   "I hope {the knockoffs} remind everyone of the original,"
shrugs Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone's publisher. And Mr. Fallon
notes practically, "We've had so many things ripped off that
it would take an entire department to follow up on it, and
I'd prefer running an advertising agency. It isn't worth the
effort."

   JWT Wins Nuprin
                                                                                                       

   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. awarded its estimated $30 million
Nuprin pain reliever account to J. Walter Thompson.
   The hotly contested account was put up for review earlier
this month after several years of disappointing sales. Grey
Advertising, which had handled the account since the brand's
introduction in 1984, also participated in the review, as did
Ogilvy &amp; Mather and several other agencies. Grey had created
the "Little, yellow, different" campaign for Nuprin.
   Thompson, a unit of WPP Group, has handled advertising for
Gerber Baby Formula, a joint venture between Bristol-Myers
and Gerber Products Co., since February 1989. The agency has
won several new accounts this year, including Toys "R" Us,
The Wall Street Journal and Premier Cruise Lines.
   Grey continues to handle a number of other Bristol-Myers
Squibb brands, including Miss Clairol, Clairesse, Ultress,
Windex, Drano and 4-Way cold products.

   CHEMLAWN SETTLES: ChemLawn Services Corp. settled a
lawsuit with New York state regarding pesticide safety claims

the state $100,000 in costs and not to make certain claims.
In one of the disputed claims, ChemLawn compared the toxicity
of treated lawn clippings to baby aspirin. ChemLawn said it
hadn't made the claims since 1987, a contention disputed by
the attorney general's office.

   LOS ANGELES -- Foothill Group said it plans to write down
certain junk bonds in its portfolio, which will lead to an
estimated second-quarter net loss of between $3.8 million and
$4.3 million.
   The commercial lending and equipment leasing concern said
the pretax writedowns are $6 million at Foothill Thrift &amp;
Loan and $3 million at the parent Foothill Group. After tax,
the write-downs will total about $5.4 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, Foothill reported second-quarter net income of
$3.2 million, or 32 cents a share.
   Henry Jordan, chief financial officer, said Foothill's
book value after the adjustments would be about $6.50 at June
30, and the company's junk-bond securities portfolio would be
less than 5% of consolidated assets. Mr. Jordan said the
portfolio writedowns are unrelated to Foothill's management
of about $130 million in distressed securities in two private
limited partnerships.
   In response to the announcement, Fitch Investors Service
affirmed Foothill Capital Corp.'s F-2 commercial paper,
noting that the financing unit has no high-yield bond
portfolio and is unaffected by the writedowns.

built there.
   The move will affect about 2,100 hourly employees on the
plant's two shifts, and it will cut Mustang production by
about 3,700 units. According to industry trade publication
Ward's Automotive Reports, Ford's dealers held an 81-day
supply of Mustangs at the end of May, significantly higher
than the 60- to 65-day supply that is optimum for the
industry.

   Second-Quarter Loss,

   ORLANDO, Fla. -- Bairnco Corp. said it expects to report a
"significant" second-quarter net loss, and the board, as
expected, slashed the quarterly dividend.
   Bairnco, which recently moved here from New York,
manufactures specialty laminates and adhesives, shielding
chambers to test electronic equipment for emissions, and
cutting products, including saws and choppers for butchers
and meatpackers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The expected net loss and dividend cut stem from losses in
the shielding unit and the general economic outlook, Bairnco
said. In the second quarter a year earlier, Bairnco earned
$3.2 million, or 30 cents a share, on $54.2 million of sales.
   Bairnco also moved back the target date for spinning off
its Keene Corp. unit to shareholders. It now expects to spin
off the unit in July; it had hoped to complete the
transaction by June 30.
   The dividend the company announced -- five cents, down
from 25 cents -- doesn't reflect the Keene unit, Bairnco
said. Keene's board will take dividend action after the
spinoff. The Bairnco dividend is payable July 20 to
shareholders of record July 13.
   Bairnco faces litigation regarding Keene. Shareholders
have filed suit, charging Bairnco misled investors about
Keene's potential asbestos liability. For five years ending
in 1974, Keene had a unit that made some products containing
asbestos; in Bairnco's annual report this year, Bairnco
disclosed that the insurance that has covered Keene for
asbestos litigation may be in doubt.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Bairnco shares fell 50 cents to $6.50.

   Verbal Fog Obscures Holocaust

   What does the Nazi murder of the Jews mean to Europeans
who are now building a new political order on their
continent? In "One, By One, By One: Facing the Holocaust"
(Simon &amp; Schuster, 318 pages, $21.95), Judith Miller, deputy
media editor of the New York Times, delivers a
country-by-country account of how Europeans distort their
past for maximum comfort. They package it, she says, instead
of thinking about it.
   "In every country . . .," writes Ms. Miller, "a
particularly national form of self-deception has usually
triumphed over self-revelation." Germany is the country with
the most responsibility for these individual tragedies, and,
Ms. Miller notes, the one that's spent the most time thinking
about that responsibility. Reflection, though, has brought
West Germans only "superficial tranquility." She takes a
lucid look at international controversies such as President
Reagan's visit to Bitburg. But her preferred tack is to study
the specific: how an old lady, Henny Oppenheimer, an exile
from the Nazis, returns to her hometown of Fulda and
discovers the grave of her first love, a slender fellow with
a musical voice; and how her meetings with living Fulda
residents resonate with strong feelings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In Fulda," reported a Stanford student from a survivor
family, " `the Holocaust' was no longer an abstraction.
Suddenly, I was at the scene of the crime, the place where my
grandfather was murdered." Such town encounters, Ms. Miller
writes, help Germans build their new country and help
outsiders come to terms with post-Hitler "Deutschland." "Only
if the Germans fully confront their past can their neighbors
come to believe that history will not repeat itself."
   Ms. Miller is tougher on Austria. Since the war's end,
Austrians have clung to what she labels the "Sound of Music"
version of their history. They prefer to see themselves like
the von Trapp family in the film, as victims of their Nazi
overlords. Most real Austrians could barely stop clapping
when the Germans rolled into Vienna.
   Modern Austrians show no remorse, as they staunchly
support their ex-Nazi president Kurt Waldheim, who covered up
his complicity with the German army while he served as United
Nations secretary general in New York. The way Ms. Miller
sees it, the Austrians elected him partly because they hated
the way the world wouldn't accept their own lying image of
themselves as victims of German tyranny. She seems to agree
with an Austrian Jew who feels today's seemingly tolerant
youth will one day become "more anti-Semitic 50-year-olds."
   The view isn't so bleak in the Netherlands. But Ms. Miller
says the Dutch launder their war guilt by making a great show
of reverence for their most famous martyr to the Holocaust.
They have more or less canonized Anne Frank, the teen-age
diarist whom Dutch friends hid for two years, before Nazis
grabbed her and starved her to death at Bergen-Belsen.
   Occupied Holland, of course, was a mixed bag. Many of the
Dutch truly were Nazi victims. But their Anne Frank obsession
also has produced what Ms. Miller sees as an unwarranted
righteousness that ignores instances of Dutch collaboration:
". . . we prefer to blame the Germans," explains one
interviewee. "We say to ourselves it was all their fault;
even young people who have no memory of the war do so."
   As for France, intellectuals seem to have done the most
damage here of all. The French do discuss the Holocaust --
Ms. Miller describes a debate over Vichy collaboration that
spoils a presidential dinner party in the Elysee Palace. But
endless salon talk about the trial of "the Butcher of Lyon,"
Klaus Barbie, "seemed to skim across the surface of French
society," and did little but win votes for the National
Front, France's ultra-right party.
   Ms. Miller does a successful if wandering job of summing
up smaller countries, but her real talent shows when she gets
to bigger fish, like the Soviet Union. Because Soviet
ideology leans so heavily on the memory of what Russians call
"the Great Patriotic War," Soviet history is proving the
hardest of all to revise. To distract attention from the site
of the horrible massacre at Katyn, where Soviets murdered
more than 4,000 Polish officers in 1943, the U.S.S.R. set up
an ersatz memorial at a nearby town with a similar name,
"Khatyn." The victims at Khatyn happened, conveniently, to be
Soviet citizens incinerated when Germans burned this town to
the ground. Now the Soviet Union is filling in the "white
spots" in its history, and has publicly acknowledged the
Soviet responsibility for Katyn. But, Ms. Miller notes, a
complete rewrite of history is unlikely to come before the
Soviet Union faces change more profound than Mikhail
Gorbachev has brought.
   The Miller tour also makes a stop in the U.S., visiting
Holocaust archives and talking to survivors. But her real
target is Europe and Europe's glibly self-exculpatory
intellectuals, hiding away the death camps in a truly final
solution of verbal fog. "Abstraction," she writes, "is
memory's most ardent enemy." The best way to deal with the
Holocaust is to skip symbols and theory, and look at what
actually happened case by case -- "one by one."

   BOSTON -- Bank of New England, continuing its
retrenchment, said it will sell or close 95 branches, more
than half of them in Massachusetts, as a cost-cutting
measure.
   The closings are part of a previously announced plan by
the bank to trim overhead by 35% in the next five months in
an effort to return to profitability. "By concentrating our
focus on locations with the most potential, we will improve
customer service while reducing overhead," said Chairman
Lawrence K. Fish.

   Bank of New England, one of the most aggressive lenders in
the region in the 1980s, has been hurt by the deepening real
estate slump. It reported a first-quarter loss of $46.6
million, or 68 cents a share, despite one-time gains from the
sale of $173 million in assets. It posted a loss of $1.11
billion last year.
   In all, 52 branches in Massachusetts and 25 in Connecticut
are slated for sale or consolidation, said bank spokesman
Thomas L. Lavelle. Closing or sale of another 18 branches,
some in rural areas of western Massachusetts, is planned,
said Mr. Lavelle. The bank is also planning to sell its
subsidiaries in Maine and Rhode Island by year's end. Once
all such plans are carried through, the bank's total will
have dropped from its current level of 444 branches to 281.
   Analysts agree it may be difficult for the bank to sell
very many of its branches during the consolidation. "If you
want to get a branch cheap, you just pick one up from the
(Resolution Trust Corportation)," said Tracey Stangle, an
analyst and senior vice president with First Albany Corp.
"They'll sell them for nothing, which is about all most New
England banks can afford right now."

   Wary of a NATO Overhaul, U.S. Hopes
   To Keep West From Conceding Too Much

   WASHINGTON -- The White House is beginning to worry that
proposals to make the Western alliance more palatable to the
Kremlin and to the Western public are moving too fast.
   When the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meets in
London this week, talk of extensive change in the alliance
will be in the air, and President Bush will be cheerleading
for change. But behind the scenes, Mr. Bush is determined to
keep the process from turning into a reckless rush.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   West Germany has floated a host of ideas to alter the
basic tenets of the alliance that has existed for more than
four decades. When NATO leaders meet in London, everything
will be open to change: defense strategy on the ground, the
positioning of nuclear weapons and the makeup of Western
military forces.
   In addition, the U.S. is prepared to discuss with its
allies eventually withdrawing U.S. nuclear-tipped artillery
shells from West Germany unilaterally, the Washington Post
reported Sunday. Such a withdrawal would be designed to
counter Soviet calls for complete denuclearization of
Germany. The White House wouldn't confirm the report.
   But U.S. officials fear the West may be hurrying into
other commitments that would cut troop levels in a united
Germany too deeply. They also are concerned that too much
loose talk of nuclear withdrawals will incite public clamor
to remove all short-range nuclear weapons from Germany before
agreements on such weapons can be negotiated with Moscow.
   So the president and his men are saying the NATO meeting
merely should start the process of changing the alliance,
rather than complete the job. This is a tricky position for
the U.S. to take because it raises the risk of a clash with
West German leaders, who are eager to accommodate Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev so he will let the united Germany
belong to NATO. The Bush administration, which has been
working assiduously to develop a special relationship with
the emerging new Germany, doesn't want to alienate Germans
now.
   The U.S. shares the general German goal; indeed, Mr. Bush
himself called the NATO summit to pave the way for a new
Germany's membership in the alliance. U.S. and German
officials already have agreed on broad outlines for how to
change NATO. Specifically, they have agreed in principle on
the idea of thinning NATO's front-line troops and putting
them under multinational commands rather than under
individual member countries.
   The NATO meeting is likely to bless such a change, which
would fundamentally overhaul Western defense strategies and
set up a defense structure that could be shrunk as East-West
tensions ease. In addition, the NATO meeting will lay plans
to begin negotiations to shrink NATO's nuclear arsenal and
perhaps adopt language for a historic non-aggression
agreement between NATO and Warsaw Pact nation.
   Yet the U.S. also wants to be sure that it doesn't
emasculate NATO, the one European organization in which the
U.S plays a dominant role. The U.S. sees a NATO with muscle
as essential to its hopes to retain political, economic and
military influence in the emerging Europe.
   U.S. officials are worried about West Germany's new
willingness to promise the Soviets specific reductions in the
united German army as part of the conventional-arms agreement
now being negotiated in Vienna. While the U.S. and West
Germany, until recently, agreed that they should offer the
Soviets some general pledge to shrink the German army after
unification, they resisted negotiating the extent of the
reduction until the conventional-arms treaty is finished and
follow-up talks with the Soviets begin.
   Now, U.S. officials say, Bonn is suggesting that a
specific pledge be made by inserting in the conventional-arms
pact a formula defining how many troops any Central European
country can maintain. U.S. officials don't want to commit the
West to a specific troop level before military planners have
calculated the size and configuration of the new NATO.
   In addition, while the U.S. has promised to stop
modernizing NATO's arsenal of short-range nuclear missiles
and shells and to start negotiating cuts in the stockpile,
Mr. Bush and his aides want to squelch any talk that NATO
might scrap its policy of reserving the right to be the first
side to use nuclear weapons.
   The U.S. considers the first-use option necessary to guard
against a conventional attack. More importantly, it worries
that a no-first-use pledge would help generate public
pressure to pull all nuclear weapons out of Germany without
waiting for an orderly negotiating process.
   Britain and France, which don't want the public pressing
them to get rid of their own nuclear arsenals, share the U.S.
sentiment. So this week's meeting, Secretary of State James
Baker suggests, "will simply kick off a review" of how the
West will negotiate cuts in short-range nuclear arms.

   EPA Bans Mercury
   From Indoor Paint;
   Poisoning Is Cited

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Citing a risk of poisoning, the
Environmental Protection Agency is banning mercury from
indoor paint and requiring outdoor paint that contains it to
carry warning labels.
   The requirements take effect Aug. 20. For paint already on
store shelves, the National Paint and Coatings Association is
working with manufacturers to place labels indicating that
any interior paint containing more than 200 parts per million
of mercury should be used only outside. While EPA officials
recommended at a briefing that consumers avoid paints with
mercury, the officials said consumers could safely use up
existing interior paint with less than 200 parts per million
of mercury as long as they ventilate thoroughly and minimize
exposure of children.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mercury is in 25% to 30% of all indoor latex paint to keep
it from spoiling while in the can. It's in about 20% to 35%
of all exterior latex paint to prevent mildew. Oil-based
paint doesn't contain mercury. Linda Fisher, an assistant EPA
administrator, said the industry will bear about $40 million
to $50 million in costs of reformulating paint, with
additional expense possible for manufacturers unable to sell
their existing stocks. For consumers, paint prices are likely
to rise about 1%.
   In a statement Friday, the paint association said it would
cooperate with the EPA, even though the association doesn't
believe "there is any scientific evidence to give consumers
any cause for alarm about use of interior products currently
on the market."
   The EPA became concerned about mercury in paint when a
four-year-old Michigan boy last year came down with a rare
form of poisoning, after paint containing mercury was used in
his home. Symptoms of this childhood mercury poisoning
include severe pain in the extremities, sweating and a rapid
heart beat. Other symptoms include slight tremors of the
hands, short-term memory loss and headaches.
   EPA officials urged people who have painted recently with
a mercury-containing paint to ventilate the area thoroughly.
The agency released a list of paint manufacturers that use
mercury and companies that don't. Consumers who want to know
whether a specific paint contains mercury can call
1-800-858-7378, a toll-free number at the National Pesticide
Telecommunication Network.
   The agency said it believes that the mercury concentration
in air decreases within a few days after painting, but that
lower concentrations may be present for months. People
wishing to dispose of paint containing mercury should consult
community hazardous-waste programs or local governments for
the proper ways to do so. Mercury shouldn't be poured down
drains, or into any bodies of water, since it is toxic to
many species, the EPA said.
   The EPA action results from a voluntary agreement worked
out with the companies that produce mercury for use in
paints. These companies are continuing to provide data that
the EPA will use to determine whether further action is
warranted for outdoor paint, or for such products as
spackling and joint compounds, which also contain mercury.
   Most pesticide uses of mercury were banned in 1976. At the
time, the agency allowed mercury's continued use in paint
because good alternatives weren't available.

one single share and not two to be divided between two
superpowers. . . . America can no longer say Arabs are tools
of the Soviet Union.
   The negative side is that it is now clear the U.S. can
exert influence on the Soviets and make them abandon any
position contrary to the U.S. So the U.S. thinks it can cast
things any way it wants in the region and in alliance with
Israel can suppress any voice in support of Arab rights. So,
the U.S. has tilted more towards Israel. This is a very grave
change.
                                                                                                       

   Can Egypt sit out a war?
   Peace is the prevailing theme in the Arab world for all
Arabs. Any Arab who wants to defend his rights should not be
interpreted as not desiring peace. Egypt is part of the Arab
world.
   If war were to break out as a result of the expansionist
policy of Israel it is only natural that this will be fought
by all Arabs. . . . (I)f fighting continues for a long time
no Arab individual shall remain capable of remaining outside
the circle of contribution to confrontation with Israel.
   Israel is accustomed in other wars to snatching quickly
from Arabs valuable objectives and this has helped Israel in
maintaining its expansionist policies.
   So if Israel were to conduct an aggression, then the con-
frontation must be long. This is the view of Iraq and Arabs
have no different view. Once the fighting continues for a
long time the outcome will be different. It will not be what
Israel desires.
                                                                                                       

   How can there be a long war when Israel possesses nuclear
weapons?
   Arabs do have new weapons which may be sufficient for
confronting this small population (Israel) if it were to
commit aggression against the larger population.
                                                                                                       

   Do you mean chemicals can deter nuclear weapons?
   Yes, I believe chemicals constitute a deterrent. Why
should the U.S. fail to voice concern when they and others
helped Israel possess nuclear weapons? When I said if Israel
attacks Iraq with nuclear weapons then Iraq would respond
with chemicals, all hell was raised and still is being
raised.
   This has been treated as a threat. It is as if the
objective was that Arabs should accept that Israel has
nuclear weapons and can dictate the situation and Arabs
should abandon all their rights.
                                                                                                       

   Are you seeking a nuclear capability?
   It has neither been in our program nor is it now in our
program to use these for military purposes.
   Iraq is in possession of binary chemical weapons. Our
scientists and technicians and military men calculate that
this is sufficient to deter an Israeli nuclear weapon. If the
U.S. were to lend us nuclear weapons with the objective of
striking a balance with the nuclear weapons given Israel, we
shall not decline them.
                                                                                                       

   Do you expect more terrorism?
   The U.S. went through a war to create an independent union
and civilians were killed. So let us address human issues on
a single standard. We cannot talk about those deprived of
basic rights as terrorists. The U.S. attacked the house of
(Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi with women and children
inside. The raid killed civilians. Is this terrorism? If
Palestinians conduct an attack in the occupied territories,
if such Palestinians are regarded as terrorists, we have to
regard the president of the United States as the greatest
terrorist.
                                                                                                       

   Is war inevitable?
   The U.S. is not prepared to sacrifice anything for peace
in the area. Does the U.S. feel it is doing us a favor just
talking to the PLO? It is the PLO that is doing the U.S. a
favor. It is opening a dialogue with a country whose bias is
clear for Israel.
   It is the duty of the U.S. to make peace comprehensive.
The U.S. should give up the evil ideas of the Zionist lobby
including the false view that the U.S. cannot guarantee oil
supplies without Israel in the region to insure that.
                                                                                                       

   What is your oil strategy?
   Oil is $14 a barrel now, one half the real level of 1971.
This price does not respond to the true value. Who is
responsible for this injustice? Western countries. Isn't this
a conspiracy against the economy of the region? We do not
want to use oil as a political weapon. . . . But nobody can
eliminate the significance of economics in political
relations.
                                                                                                       

   What are prospects of a final peace with Iran?
   We are conducting direct dialogue with the Iranians and
each party has told the other that we are placing great hopes
on this dialogue achieving the desired objectives. So my hope
is great that peace will come about between Iran and Iraq.
                                                                                                       

   Why do you call on U.S. ships to leave the Persian Gulf?
   We were not consulted by the U.S. when the ships were
brought in, but we didn't fight their presence because some
of our Arab brothers under the existence of Iranian
aggression saw it proper that U.S. ships should be allowed.
But now that East-West relations have achieved such a
positive level and now that the Iraq-Iran War is over, we
cannot see how the presence of U.S. ships can be interpreted
for positive reasons. Ask the U.S. what are the reasons for
their presence other than conducting intelligence on Arabs
for Israel or creating a naval military situation between
Iraq and Iran.

   Shift in Strategy

   DALLAS -- Recognition Equipment Inc. will introduce soon a
series of products aimed at the computer imaging market,
company officials said.
   The new products represent a shift in strategy for the
company, which is trying to reshape its own image after a
string of quarterly losses and a host of litigation. As part
of that shift, Recognition Equipment is divesting itself of
some operations to focus its attention on image processing,
systems that enable companies to automate the handling of
paperwork.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The products to be introduced fall into three categories.
One category will enable users to create and modify their own
image processing systems without requiring sophisticated
programming knowledge. The second will enable users to enter
images and data from documents into the system. The third is
made up of workstation products that enable each user to
program the system to handle specific work applications.
Recognition Equipment can sell customers products in each
category or bundle them into a complete system.
   Recognition Equipment has been involved in optical
scanning products for some time. But in the past few months,
the company has shifted its strategic focus from developing
specific, proprietary systems to industry-standard products
that can be adapted to any customer's equipment, said Tom
Hurley, co-chief executive officer.
   The company also is approaching the market differently,
Mr. Hurley said, by teaming with computer makers and systems
integrators to develop complete systems for customers. As an
example, he cited the proposal the company submitted with
Wang Laboratories Inc. to provide a large state agency with
an imaging system that would automate the handling of tax
forms. In other projects, the company is teaming with
companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and
Andersen Consulting.
   Mr. Hurley said Recognition Equipment is focusing its
marketing attention on systems for government agencies and
transportation, insurance and financial services companies,
all of which handle large amounts of documents. But it hopes
to gain business in other market niches through its partners.
   Bob Vanourek, co-chief executive, said that the company is
looking at the possibility of selling assets that contribute
about $100 million in sales annually, but that only the
Postalogic division, which makes mail reading and sorting
systems, has been sold. Because of the difficulty in finding
financing sources these days, he said, the sale of assets
hasn't progressed as quickly as hoped. And he said the
company isn't under any pressure to sell and may choose to
operate the divisions as autonomous units if adequate bids
don't emerge.
   Mr. Vanourek wouldn't project earnings, but said the
company is "getting close" to returning to profitability. For
the first half ended April 30, the company had a net loss of
$13 million, wider than the $490,000 loss a year earlier.
   Mr. Vanourek also noted that the company increased its
cash balances to $45 million at the end of the second quarter
from about $25 million a year earlier, and attracted some
significant new outside institutional investors. He also
estimated that the company's work force has shrunk about 11%
to about 2,200 in recent months, and said the major staff
reductions "are behind us."
   Messrs Hurley and Vanourek were installed as co-chief
executives late last year under an agreement with Prospect
Group, a leveraged buy-out firm that attempted to take over
Recognition Equipment. New York-based Prospect owns a 14%
stake in the company. Recognition has been mired in eight
civil lawsuits relating to a 1988 indictment that accused the
company and two of its top officers with attempting to
manipulate the award of $400 million in U.S. Postal Service
contracts. In November, a federal judge acquitted all
defendants in the case; since then, Mr. Vanourek said, the
company has settled most of the major litigation stemming
from the indictments.

   Bronfmans Move
   Closer to Acquiring
   Unicorp Canada

   TORONTO -- Toronto's Bronfman family took a step closer to
acquiring control of Unicorp Canada Corp. after agreeing to
backstop part of a 100 million Canadian dollar (US$85.8
million) rights offering.
   Under the proposed offering, Hees International Bancorp
Inc. and BrasPower Ltd., both indirectly controlled by
financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman, could together take up
rights giving them as much as 69% of the voting shares of
Unicorp. Hees already has a 24% non-voting stake in the
company, acquired through a previous rights issue in January.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   BrasPower, jointly owned by Hees and Brascan Ltd., the
Bronfmans' resource-investment arm, has agreed to underwrite
up to C$50 million of the rights offering. James Leech,
Unicorp's president, said the Bronfman interests could
acquire between 17% and 69% of the voting shares of Unicorp,
depending on how many other shareholders take up their
rights.
   The rights will be granted all holders of both the Class A
non-voting and Class B voting Unicorp shares.
   The rights issue units will consist of a total of 10
million preferred shares and 10 million warrants to purchase
Unicorp's Class B voting shares. The units won't be priced
until all regulatory approvals have been received, a process
Unicorp said will take about 120 days.
   The Bronfman interests will also move to take operating
control of Unicorp almost immediately. George Mann, founder
and controlling shareholder of Unicorp, said he is stepping
down as chairman and passing responsibility for the company's
day-to-day operations to Robert Dunford, executive
vice-president of Brascan and president of BrasPower. Mr.
Mann couldn't be reached for comment as to whether he plans
to take up his rights.
   Brascan, which has a two-year right to buy Hees'
non-voting stake in Unicorp, is interested in expanding its
utility operations as a "fourth leg" to complement its other
resource investments. These include a 42% stake in Noranda
Inc., the giant Toronto-based mining, forest products and
energy concern.
   Unicorp is in the throes of a major restructuring which
will leave it as a company with assets in the energy sector.
Through 60%-owned Union Energy Inc., Unicorp controls
Canada's second-largest natural gas distribution company,
Union Gas Ltd., Calgary oil and gas producer Mark Resources
Ltd., as well as natural gas marketing and transportation
concerns.
   As part of that restructuring, the company plans to pay
out as dividends shares of the troubled Unicorp American
Corp. to common shareholders of Unicorp Canada. The American
unit's major remaining asset is Lincoln Savings Bank, which
is being held for disposition.
   Unicorp said BrasPower will provide a C$50 million credit
facility to assist in the restructuring of Unicorp American
and support the operations of Union Energy.
   Brascan officials couldn't be reached for comment. But
Trevor Eyton, its president, said after the annual meeting in
May that he expects Brascan to acquire Hees's stake in
Unicorp before the end of the year. He also noted that
Brascan usually wants a stake of between 40% and 50% in its
major corporate investments.

   The manufacturers will modify the cars' air-injection
systems, clean and modify the carburetors and clean the
exhaust gas recirculation systems. The companies agreed to
the recall, which will be free to owners, after reviewing EPA
test results that showed excessive levels of hydrocarbons,
carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide in the cars' exhaust.
   Mitsubishi began notifying owners by mail Friday.
Chrysler, which will repair the Dodge and Plymouth models,
expects to begin notifying owners in mid-August, the EPA
said.

   It's Too Late for a Party Congress

   Ilya Saslavski is the new Soviet man. He is 28, but looks
22. The capitalist reformer with the intense, boney face is
both a deputy to the National People's Congress and the
elected head of the Oktyabrsky District in Moscow. Aides
twice his age hover around him in an austere office the size
of three Soviet apartments. Crutches rest against the wall
behind his desk. Mr. Saslavski is an invalid, and even in
summer he wraps his slight body in two sweaters.
   While the much-publicized party convenes within the
Kremlin walls today, the real action is taking place at a
more local level, around such combative intellectuals as Mr.
Saslavski.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Western accounts tend to treat Soviet politics as normal
and ordered, with disputes settled at prearranged meetings
like the congress. But order has abandoned the Soviet Union.
The party has already lost the ability to impose its
decisions on the nation. It now vies for authority with many
semi-autonomous political bodies -- including parliaments on
each level of government, municipal governments, ministry
bureaucracies and the Presidential Council. Each of these
institutions tends to ignore the decisions of the others.
   Asked what will happen at the 28th Party Congress, Mr.
Saslavski replies: "Nothing] A big spectacle] Somebody will
cry about the salvation of socialism, about the old great
Fatherland. Somebody will say the party must make a new face.
I know a lot of fascist criminals who have made a new face
for themselves."
   Local authorities no longer try to reform the old power
centers, but to displace them. The Russian republic
government of Boris Yeltsin has assumed foreign policy powers
from the federal level and at a news conference Wednesday,
Mr. Yeltsin said he was willing to assume monetary policy as
well.
   In this chaotic atmosphere, the struggle for control of
the Soviet Union comes to resemble a turf war. The party
apparatus seeks to maintain control of its property while
reformers aim to sell or give the buildings to private
enterprise. At the height of the Lithuanian crisis, the party
was worrying about protecting buildings.
   A property battle in Mr. Saslavski's district is typical.
The Russian Communist Party recently built an apartment
building there, for use by the party elite. But Mr. Saslavski
has announced that he is taking possession of the building in
the name of the local government, and turning over the
apartments to ordinary families. The dispute is to be settled
in court, but Mr. Saslavski wouldn't have mounted the
challenge unless he knew that the local judge was pro-reform.
   In Moscow and Leningrad, the hardline Communist parties
have grabbed the local newspapers away from city governments.
Battles rage for control of each television channel.
Sometimes, the fighting gets trivial. In the Moscow City
Soviet last Wednesday, hardliners put a bust of Lenin in a
hallway. Later in the day, the reformist bloc marched down
the hall and stole it.
   The crisis of authority pervades the bureaucracy. "I don't
know what the decision-making process will be tomorrow," says
economist Andrei Anikin. "I don't know what it is today. I
only know what it was yesterday." Parts of the nation are now
free zones, where reformers have managed to carve out some
turf. But there is no stability, no civil society.
   Amidst this rugged political street fighting, democratic
reformers reject the moralistic politics of a Vaclav Havel or
an Andrei Sakharov. "If people think they can rule with a
moral mantle, they will fail," says Pastahor Koteinkovo,
considered one of the more brilliant young political
scientists in the nation. "Politics is a professional
business. The people understand that there is no place for
morality in politics."
   Reformers say their main purpose now is to forge alliances
with party hacks and other opportunists. Moscow's reformist
City Council head Gavriil Popov, for instance, has already
established ties with powerful KGB figures.
   "Democrats proved their ability to ally with different
people when they made an alliance with Yeltsin. He was not a
democrat and it has turned out to be a very good alliance,"
says Andrei Kutinikov of the Institute of the U.S.A. and
Canada.
   It has indeed. Mr. Yeltsin has surrounded himself with
free-market intellectuals and, according to reformers, has
irretrievably tied himself to capitalism. The democrats are
practically rapturous about Mr. Yeltsin's tactical genius.
Recently, he was invited to speak to the conservative party
leaders, but he stood them up to visit new graduates of the
military academy.
   Mr. Yeltsin moreover is the crucial link between the
democratic intelligentsia and the people. "He is the only
man, and the last man, who can be believed by the miners,"
says People's Deputy Eugeny Vostrikov. At a press conference
Wednesday, Mr. Yeltsin declared that the federal government
had violated every plank of its recent agreement with the
miners, and announced that from now on, his Russian
government would take control of mine issues. Thus, he is the
major source of stability, for if the miners or transport
workers go on strike, then the Soviet Union dissolves quickly
into chaos.
   In the West, Mr. Yeltsin's claims that the KGB recently
tried to kill him are discounted, but here they are treated
as fact. Mr. Yeltsin has his own bodyguards and will not
accept KGB protection. It is also widely believed that while
the military could succeed in overthrowing Mr. Gorbachev
without much public protest, the generals would have a
difficult time mobilizing their troops against Mr. Yeltsin.
   As democrats have consolidated, so have the party
hardliners. The years of perestroika provided them with
greater resources, and have especially strengthened the
young, aggressive party officials. "They are profiteering
from perestroika," explains economist and Democratic Union
leader Yuri Skubco. "The party nomenklatura have the power to
register new enterprises. The whole system depends on whom
the "apparatchiks" decide to give registration to. Basically,
the sphere of cooperation with foreign companies was
controlled by the KGB."
   Party conservatives organized their troops at the recent
Russian Party Congress, and they will be further consolidated
at this week's Union Congress, at which the Russian oligarchs
will join even more rigid Leninists from the Baltics and
Byelorussia.
   The Party is still the richest organization in the Soviet
Union. It controls the most important trump card, the KGB. As
recently retired KGB Maj. Gen. Oleg Kalugin explains in the
current issue of Moscow News, the KGB is as engaged in
domestic political espionage, as it always was.
   For democrats, the Party Congress will mark the formal
break with the Leninist forces. This will provide the
headlines, but in actuality, of course, the two sides broke
long ago. Society is polarized.
   Mr. Gorbachev sits in the middle, alone. "Perhaps Mr.
Gorbachev will give to the party the opportunity to make
quarrels among themselves and he will look at them like Zeus
looking down on earth," says Mr. Saslavski. Other observers
suggest a Romanian strategy: Mr. Gorbachev could change the
party's name, appoint new leaders, and then form a coalition
with phony democratic parties.
   But the widespread sense is that brilliant tactics can no
longer save Mr. Gorbachev. He has violated the trust of both
sides. Although he still controls the stageplay of the Party
Congress, he may be left irrelevant to political reality, as
the struggle for power dissolves into building-by-building
battles between hard young democrats and hard young
apparatchiks.
   For 72 years the Communists have portrayed the New Soviet
Man, a musclebound behemoth, loyal to the collective and
smiling vapidly. Now along comes the likes of Ilya Saslavski,
an arrogant, prickly manchild with useless legs. The
conservatives may win in the end in a bloodbath, but for the
moment, in the Oktyabrsky district, he is beating them.

   May Housing Starts
   In Japan Surged 8.4%

   TOKYO -- Japanese housing starts in May surged 8.4% from a
year earlier, after a large increase in construction of
private houses, the Construction Ministry said.
   A ministry official attributed the jump in starts of
single-unit dwellings to demand pent up since winter, when
construction was discouraged by fears of an interestrate
spiral in Japan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Overall housing starts totaled 146,627 units in May.
Starts of private single-unit houses rose 10% from a year
earlier to 48,629 units.
   The weakness of the yen forced the Bank of Japan, the
central bank, to raise its official discount rate half a
percentage point December and a full point in March, bringing
it to its current level of 5.25%. The discount rate is the
interest rate charged on loans to financial institutions. The
increases didn't have immediate effects on the yen's exchange
rate, leading to speculation that further rate boosts could
be ahead.
   The yen and bond prices strengthened in May, though the
currency remained weak, compared with levels in 1989, and its
stability helped dispel fears of another immediate increase
in base interest rates.
   New confidence that interest rates wouldn't rise released
several months of pent-up demand for private housing, a
ministry official said.
   New housing starts increased 0.5% in April, and declined
2% in March, compared with year-earlier levels.
   A large number of renovations that got under way in May
added to the growth in private-housing starts, the official
said.
   Growth in starts of new rental housing was lower, at 5.3%.
Starts totaled 66,739 units. A total of 28,436 units in
multifamily dwellings began construction in May, up 9.1%.
   Starts of company housing continued to be strong in May,
reflecting Japan's tight labor market. Construction began on
2,823 units of corporate housing, up 59%. Companies are being
forced to offer greater benefits to workers, including
housing, to prevent them from switching jobs.
   The ministry expects growth in housing starts to remain
strong in the months ahead, but to decline from May's high
levels, the official said. Release of the backed-up demand
for housing will spell more moderate increases, he said. en

Administration said it hopes to get its space shuttle fleet
flying soon, after grounding it for the first time since the
1986 Challenger disaster.
   The space agency, already reeling from news that the $2.5
billion Hubble space telescope was fundamentally flawed, said
it is idling its three space shuttles. The snafus already
have drawn criticism on Capitol Hill and cast doubt on
continued support for such other big-ticket NASA projects as
plans to return to the Moon and to explore Mars.

   NASA grounded the shuttles after discovering a fuel leak
on the shuttle Atlantis strikingly similar to a leak found in
May on the shuttle Columbia. The space agency removed
Columbia from the launch pad and returned it to the assembly
building for repair.
   "We won't fly until we understand the problem and have a
fix," said William Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for
space flight.
   Both shuttles had leaks of hydrogen fuel, NASA said,
somewhere in an assemblage of piping that leads from the
shuttle's external fuel tank to the orbiter. The agency said
a 17-inch-diameter fuel line "is contributing to the leak."
The fuel line assembly is made by Parker Hannifin Corp. in
Cleveland, NASA said.
   But a spokesman for Parker Hannifin said the company makes
only "certain components" of the assembly and that tests so
far haven't indicated any problems with these parts. "We make
a piece of the action, but not the whole thing," the
spokesman said.
   The duration of the grounding is difficult to gauge, Mr.
Lenoir said, because NASA hasn't found the source of the
leaks. At a minimum, NASA plans to roll Atlantis back to its
hangar and expects a launch delay of several weeks. Atlantis
was scheduled to launch a military reconnaissance satellite
in mid-July.
   But if the cause of the leak is a design flaw in the
assembly, the grounding could stretch on for months or years.
Simply building a new piping assembly takes more than a year,
said shuttle director Robert Crippen. NASA is designing an
improved assembly, he said, but that work is several years
from completion.
   Locating the cause of the leak has proved to be tough.
NASA said it returned part of the Columbia piping assembly to
Rockwell International Corp., which has overall
responsibility for the orbiter, but that engineers there
hadn't been able to reproduce the leak. NASA suspects that
the leak appears only on the launch pad because the pipes
there are subjected to ultracold temperatures and a fast flow
of liquid hydrogen that can't be reproduced in the lab.
   The space agency first assumed that the leak was a quirk
on Columbia, but finding it again on Atlantis threw out that
assumption. Problems that cut across the shuttle fleet are
more difficult, costly and time-consuming to repair.
   NASA had expected to launch a $150 million shuttle-based
observatory and the spy satellite by shuttle this summer, but
both now are at risk of being delayed past October. At that
time, the shuttle Discovery is scheduled to launch the
Ulysses spacecraft, which will study the sun. If NASA misses
the Ulysses launch period, the European-built craft will have
to be delayed for 13 months until the planets are in proper
alignment for the launch. Ulysses will travel to Jupiter
before heading over the solar poles.
   Meanwhile, NASA was struggling to overcome the political
difficulties caused by the Hubble malfunction. Sen. Albert
Gore (D., Tenn.), chairman of the science, technology and
space subcommittee, grilled several NASA officials about the
spacecraft's problems. Hubble indicated NASA's inability to
manage large projects, he said. "At the present time, NASA's
eyes are bigger than its stomach," the lawmaker said.

refinancing package.
   The newspaper, broadcasting and cable-television concern,
which issued the discount debentures as part of a

is composed of a $700 million bank facility and a $400
million private placement of unsecured senior notes.

   In addition to redeeming the debt, Multimedia said it will
use the proceeds from the refinancing to service its bank

   Multimedia said its new credit agreements allow it to buy
back stock within certain limitations; it may do so based on
market conditions. The refinancing facilities provide an
overall interest rate of about 11%, the company said.

   Pressure Rises
   For New Accord
   On Cut in CFCs

   LONDON -- The ink is barely dry on a world
ozone-protection agreement reached here, but political
pressure for tougher measures is already mounting.
   The United Nations-sponsored pact calls for the developed
world to ban chlorofluorocarbons and many other
ozone-destroying chemicals by the year 2000. The developing
world has an extra decade to comply. The accord, expected to
cost the U.S. economy about $4.5 billion, is aimed at halting
chemically caused damage to the atmosphere's natural layer of
ozone gas, which helps block the Sun's harmful ultraviolet
rays.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the London agreement won't be the last word on the
subject. Even as the 10-day meeting ended Friday, officials
from West Germany, Australia, Scandinavia and other
"green"-minded nations were pushing for tougher measures --
including a ban by 1997, instead of 2000. And
environmentalists and some leading ozone scientists
immediately denounced the accord as inadequate to protect the
ozone layer.
   "Within five years' time, they {world governments} will
realize they have to go a lot faster" to end use of CFCs,
said Joseph C. Farman, a British scientist whose discovery of
an "ozone hole" over Antarctica in 1985 touched off the
global alarm over CFCs. The accord, Mr. Farman said, will
still allow a 33% rise over the next decade in the
atmospheric concentration of ozone-destroying chlorine
compounds -- with unpredictable results for human health.
   The prospect of tougher curbs worries many
chemical-industry officials, who say even the 2000 deadline
will be difficult to meet. "It's crystal ball-gazing," said
Michael Harris, a lobbyist for Britain's Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC. The accord "is an act of faith that somehow
or other our industry will find the answers to meet that
timetable."
   The world's $2 billion-a-year production of CFCs and
related chemicals are used in refrigerators, air
conditioners, foam insulation, spray cans and industrial
solvent compounds. Many of these uses can be avoided; for
instance, nations can easily replace CFCs with hydrocarbon
gases as spray-can propellants, as U.S. industry did by law
in 1978.
   But industry officials say that at least 40% of today's
CFC uses will depend for substitutes on special
ozone-friendly chemicals that the industry is only now
developing, many of which won't be ready until the middle of
the decade.
   Most of the measures adopted in London -- which must still
be ratified by each nation's legislature -- are already in
U.S. House and Senate drafts of the Clean Air Act in
Congress.

   NEW YORK -- Amerada Hess Corp. said a Canadian company
owned jointly by its Amerada Minerals Corp. of Canada Ltd.
subsidiary and by Poco Petroleums Ltd. of Canada, agreed to
purchase a Canadian oil and gas company for 305.5 million
Canadian dollars (US$260 million).
   The companies will purchase Placer Cego Petroleum Holdings
Ltd. from Placer Dome Inc., Vancouver. Placer Cego has
producing properties and exploration acreage principally in
British Columbia and Alberta. It also operates nine gas
producing plants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cash-rich Placer Dome said the sale is expected to close
Sept. 27 and should generate a "favorable" special gain to
Placer Dome and inflate its cash holdings to more than C$1
billion, its spokesman said. He wouldn't estimate the size of
the gain.
   Placer Dome, a major gold producer, has never regarded oil
and gas as a core business. The company put all of its
Canadian and U.S. energy assets up for sale in December,
after receiving what it termed unsolicited expressions of
interest. In May, Placer Dome announced a pact to sell its
U.S. oil and gas unit, Houston-based Prairie Producing Co.,
to Los Angeles-based Unocal Corp., for $336 million including
assumed debt.
   "This is a fairly significant acquisition for Amerada
Hess," said Bruce Lazier, an analyst with Prescott Ball &amp;
Turben Inc., New York. Mr. Lazier said the purchase is part
of an aggressive expansion plan by Amerada, which last
September acquired a big package of oil and gas assets in the
Gulf of Mexico from an affiliate of Houston's Transco Energy
Co., for $886 million.
   Poco, a modest but fast-growing oil and gas producer, said
its share of the purchase price is C$31.1 million, and the
transaction will ultimately result in it acquiring interests
in several properties in British Columbia and Alberta.

   I was sorry to hear that the court in Havana gave long

opposition. Their only crime was that they demanded that Cuba
be launched on the path toward pluralism, democracy, and a
market economy: that is, on the path which is followed today
by all former totalitarian countries of Central and Eastern
Europe.
   Mr. President, I firmly protest against the decision of
Cuban justice, which I see as another step of your country
toward the darkest past, as a gross violation of basic human
rights, and as an insult to the civilized world. I,
therefore, request that you ask for an immediate release of

   Law:
   State Bar Groups Toughen Discipline
   For Lawyers Despite Their Objections

   In an episode of "L.A. Law," attorney Michael Kuzak found
himself in an ethical quandary for suppressing the fact that
his opposing counsel in a big case wasn't a lawyer. It took
just a week for the California state bar to suspend him.
   In reality, lawyer discipline hasn't been nearly that
swift or effective, but it is getting better. Under pressure
from consumers, judges and even a few reform-minded lawyers,
state bars from California to Florida have toughened their
discipline acts over the past two years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consider: Last year, the California bar boosted its
discipline spending 75% to $33.4 million and added a
full-time court devoted exclusively to discipline matters;
Illinois has added some non-lawyers to its discipline
process, and opened to the public hearings that used to be
closed-door -- just in time to hear a case against the
president of the Chicago Bar Association. In January, a
federal judge invalidated a Florida bar rule that treated
lawyers like kings by threatening to jail consumers who
voiced complaints about attorneys in public. A month later,
the state Supreme Court approved even broader changes.
   New Jersey is already seeing benefits of tough new
standards for lawyers: Between 1984 and 1989, while the
number of dues-paying attorneys in the state rose about 50%,
the number of total complaints filed against them actually
declined.
   New Jersey lawyers "have the benefit of a rule that is
certain," says Raymond Trombadore, the chief of New Jersey's
lawyer discipline agency. Adds James Fox Miller, president of
the Florida Bar, "Short of perfection, {the system} is
getting better and better."
   But as the reprimands escalate, so do objections from
within the ranks of attorneys. Indeed, a growing number of
lawyers accused of misconduct, along with their defenders,
seem to think that the system is becoming increasingly rigged
against them.
   "They're being jerks," says Arthur Margolis, a Los Angeles
defense lawyer and a former state-bar prosecutor, referring
to California's state bar disciplinarians. Some attorneys
argue that lawyers accused of misconduct are being denied
their constitutional rights, while others voice concern about
how lawyers are turning in each other in what one calls a
"Hitler-youth type scenario." Still others say
disciplinarians lack sensitivity to lawyers with alcohol or
drug dependencies, which are behind as many as 40% of the
customer complaints.
   Of course, many people believe lawyers remain an overly
protective order when it comes to disciplining themselves.
Only a small fraction of complaints lodged against lawyers
ever result in formal discipline, and getting outright
disbarred remains no easy task. Local bars generally continue
to control the discipline process, and they admit that some
of the biggest gripes about lawyers, such as their
competence, remain outside the scope of such proceedings.
   Mostly, discipline is meted out for the grossest forms of
misconduct, such as stealing client funds. Nevertheless, more
people than ever are filing complaints against lawyers. HALT,
a Washington, D.C., legal reform group, estimates that 93,000
complaints were filed against lawyers in 1988, compared with
about 70,000 in 1985.
   Concern about inadequate funding for discipline has
prompted the American Bar Association to commission a hard
look at the subject. The last time the ABA did that, in 1970,
the system was declared "powerless, antiquated and
scandalous." In February, when the latest commission held a
public hearing in Los Angeles, "we got 200 people who wanted
to tell us their horror stories," recalls Mr. Trombadore, the
New Jersey discipline chief and a member of the panel. "Some
people came 800 to 900 miles" to complain.
   "I have totally lost confidence in the ability of the
state bar to discipline its members," gripes Barry Silberg, a
Santa Rosa, Calif., plastic surgeon who says he filed a
complaint against his ex-wife's lawyer in a divorce
proceeding, but saw it dismissed without explanation. "I
think the bar is essentially a marketing organization in this
state," he adds.
   Some California lawyers, though, think the reality is much
harsher. Last year, California's Supreme Court upheld a law
that empowers the bar to temporarily suspend lawyers even
before their discipline cases have been finally adjudicated.
Defense lawyers had complained that the law was
unconstitutional because it deprived the accused of due
process of law. The bar used the new authority to suspend
about 20 lawyers last year.
   Mr. Margolis, the Los Angeles defense lawyer, complains
that the bar is "overreacting." This spring, one of his
clients, celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, admitted
to seven ethical violations, including failing to promptly
return unearned fees to clients. His name, though, was tarred
with more serious charges that could have led to disbarment
-- such as stealing from clients -- only to have the bar drop
those charges, according to Mr. Margolis. State bar officials
say they aren't finished with Mr. Mitchelson, however, and
recently filed new charges that he misappropriated client
trust accounts. Of the new charges, Mr. Margolis asserts:
"They were drafted as poorly as the prior ones, and it is
clear there has been an inadequate investigation."
   Other California attorneys are alarmed at what they
consider to be an unsympathetic view of lawyer misconduct
stemming from drug or alcohol abuse.
   Lawyer David Demergian concedes that he had problems when
California's state bar court last year recommended that he be
disbarred for misappropriating $25,000 from client trust
accounts. According to court records, during a three-day
period in June 1985, "he used three and one-half ounces of
cocaine, pointed a loaded gun at his fiance and a friend, and
expressed a desire to kill his former secretary." But Mr.
Demergian, who admitted to a cocaine problem, sought
leniency, arguing that he had paid back the stolen funds,
become active in rehab programs, and had 67 letters of
support from judges, attorneys and clergy. No dice. The
California Supreme Court upheld the disbarment order.
   "Do you kill him or give him a chance to rehabilitate
himself?" asks Ted Cohen, a Los Angeles lawyer who defends
lawyers in substance-abuse cases. "They are just coming down
too hard on these people."
   A 1988 Illinois Supreme Court decision requiring lawyers
to turn in each other for ethical lapses has also drawn major
fire. The case involved a lawyer who spent some settlement
money he won for a client. The client hired a second attorney
to get the money back. That second lawyer was suspended for a
year for failing to notify the state bar after learning of
the first lawyer's misappropriation.
   "Lawyers can be faulted for a lot of things, but the
profession has historically treated the attorney-client
relationship in a very special way," says Warren Lupel, a
Chicago legal defense lawyer. "This {rule} kind of breaches
that. It is creating a Hitler-youth type scenario." Mr. Lupel
says the case prompted more than 900 such lawyer vs. lawyer
complaints last year.
   Illinois lawyers, he adds, are being asked by the state
bar to respond to complaints about their phone demeanor or
for neglecting messages. "If I notified a state agency in
Illinois that a doctor was not returning my phone call, they
would laugh and hang up," Mr. Lupel says.
   Nevertheless, states are plowing ahead with tough reforms.
Last year, the number of lawyers punished by the California
state bar jumped 44%; a once-huge backlog of unresolved
complaints is rapidly being whittled down. New Jersey now
randomly audits attorney finances and automatically disbars
attorneys who steal from their clients. Unlike most states,
New Jersey also prohibits disbarred attorneys from seeking
reinstatement.
   Dominic Aprile, a Newark, N.J., defense lawyer, says that
the changes have come at the expense of lawyers'
constitutional rights. Lawyers facing discipline have more at
stake than, say, a person charged with petty crimes, but have
far fewer legal protections, he believes.
   Mr. Trombadore, the New Jersey discipline-agency chief,
disagrees, saying: "The deterrent effect outweighs the
occasional hardship that might be generated in a case that
cries out for mitigation."

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- The former president of North Atlantic
Fisheries Inc. settled a Securities and Exchange Commission
lawsuit accusing him of stealing company funds, falsifying
books and records, and filing false statements with
regulators.
   The case stemmed from allegations by the SEC that Peter
Kolokouris, as president of North Atlantic, committed fraud
in connection with the company's 1985 initial public
offering. In the civil suit filed in federal court in
Rochester, the SEC alleged that Mr. Kolokouris had a secret
ownership interest in the company's underwriter, from which
he received kickbacks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kolokouris settled the case without admitting or
denying the allegations. North Atlantic, which processes and
distributes fish, is operating under a temporary receiver
appointed by the federal Judge Michael Telesca in Rochester.
   John R. Parrinello, an attorney for Mr. Kolokouris, said,
"It was clear that a settlement was in the best interest of
everybody."
   As part of the settlement, Mr. Kolokouris turned over $2.1
million in stock in North Atlantic, Flower City Chemicals
Inc., Zorba's Palace Inc. and Rochester Venture Associates
Inc. This amounts to all the stock Mr. Kolokouris owned or
controlled in those companies. He will also resign as an
officer of those companies.
   The settlement prohibits Mr. Kolokouris from being an
officer or owning 5% or more of any public company for five
years.

   Lithuania Agrees
   To Suspend Act
   Of Independence

   Lithuania gave Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a gift by
temporarily freezing its act of independence in time for the
start of the Soviet Communist Party congress today. Mr.
Gorbachev is returning the favor by turning the gas pumps
back on.
   The breakthrough opens the door to negotiations that
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene predicted
could lead to independence in two or three years. Lithuanian
radicals fear a Soviet trick, but the Parliament accepted
Mrs. Prunskiene's logic that "you can only have talks with an
independent country, so the very fact of having talks shows
we're already a little independent."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's moratorium will last for 100 days from the
start of talks and can be extended or terminated at
Lithuania's will. If the negotiations break off or if the
Lithuanian Parliament is kept from its business, the
moratorium will automatically cease. The leaders of
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, the three Baltic republics,
agreed Saturday to seek joint talks with Moscow on
independence, Reuters reported.
   The timing of Lithuania's announcement gave Mr. Gorbachev
a badly needed victory. But the decision stemmed more from
diplomacy than desperation; the Kremlin's two-month-long
blockade was singularly unsuccessful at disrupting daily life
or undermining spirit in Lithuania.
   As the Parliament debated the dangers of compromise,
Vilnius felt more like a summer resort than a city under
siege. The blockade had forced some 50,000 people out of
work, but most took long paid summer holidays, and the
reality of unemployment hadn't hit home. Gas shipments had
long since stopped, but the roads were full of cars fueled by
gasoline brought in privately from Poland and Byelorussia and
sold on the black market. Shops were full and there were few
lines.
   The blockade of gas and vital raw materials was Moscow's
key instrument in trying to force Lithuania to renounce its
drive for independence. It did take a toll: Hundreds of
factories curtailed operations and 10 plants, including a
major oil refinery, were shut down. People lived under strict
rationing for months.
   But the blockade also strengthened the confidence of many
Lithuanian's in their ability to make it without Moscow.
"First we thought we couldn't stand the blockade more than a
month, but now after two months we realize we can survive
these conditions," said Povilas Gylys, an economics professor
and official of the independent Lithuanian Communist Party.
   Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev seems to have understood the
blockade strategy wasn't working as planned. After returning
from his visit to the U.S. in May, he backed down from his
refusal to negotiate unless the republic revoked its March 11
declaration, and proposed a freeze instead.
   "Both sides can interpret a moratorium as their own
victory," Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told the
Parliament last week. "They can say it's not independence,
and we can say it's the first step toward independence."

   CUPERTINO, Calif -- Apple Computer Inc. said it will keep
its Claris software unit, scrapping plans to sell it off
through a public stock offering.
   As previously reported, Apple decided to retain Claris,
which makes applications software for Apple's computers, to
help insure a flow of improvements to both application and
systems software.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Systems software, which controls the basic operations of a
computer, is considered a major strength of Apple's
computers, which are widely believed to be easy to use. But
this year competing makers of personal computers have been
able to make their machines easier to use with the help of a
new version of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.
   Industry observers suspect Apple's sudden desire to retain
Claris, which spent much of this year planning an initial
public offering, is a response to the new version of Windows,
released in late May.
   "That isn't so," said William Campbell, Claris's chief
executive officer. "This decision will elicit some negative
responses, but, over time, people will realize that Apple's
intent wasn't to panic about Windows."

   Not All Employee Ownership Plans Will Fly

   Much has been written about the democratic implications of
employee ownership and self-management. Less effort has gone
into tracking the actual financial and structural condition
of an enterprise once control has been exercised by its
employees. And even less research has been spent on employee
ownership in those instances where employees are organized
and controlled by national unions.
   As investors ponder the financing of the takeover of
United Airlines by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA),
the International Association of Machinists (IAM), and the
Airline Flight Attendants (AFA), they would do well to take a
closer look at what union management has already cost this
once-invincible airline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the unions are successful, the employees will indeed
own United, and will gain from improvements in profits that
result. United will, however, be controlled by the union
leadership, despite the appointment of Chrysler's former No.
2 man, Gerald Greenwald, as the chief executive if the
buy-out succeeds. While Mr. Greenwald certainly is qualified
for the position, his experience in union negotiations seemed
to be paramount in his appointment. Thus, key decisions may
be made on a political basis rather than on a long-range
economic basis, because union officials must make re-election
their prime objective.
   To be sure, Mr. Greenwald will strive for a sound
management approach and there will be "independents" on the
company board. But like Mr. Greenwald, they will be chosen by
the unions. Management personnel at United clearly understand
that being in the unions' good graces will help them hold
their jobs, and any "independent" manager or board member
will surely understand this too. But does all this
decision-making power really affect the company's bottomline?
   The pitfalls of union decision making at United are well
illustrated by the failed Frontier Airlines deal. United
could have acquired this regional airline in 1986. But it
needed to maintain Frontier pilots' lower wages for five
years to make the deal profitable. The pilots union nixed
this proposed acquisition by refusing a wage deal, despite
the wishes of Frontier pilots whose jobs were at stake, and
despite the fact that the deal would have given United
control of Denver, plus valuable planes, gates and hangars.
   Here, ALPA stunted United's growth, and the airline
slipped behind American -- now No. 1 in the industry. And
when Frontier ultimately was taken over by Continental, its
pilots were forced to work for much lower wages. The probable
reason for ALPA's intransigence: A merger of United with
Frontier would have added millions to the cost of ALPA taking
over control of United. This kind of decision making -- plus
the sale of Covia, United's extremely valuable computer
reservations system, to help finance the buy-out -- will
likely lead to a further loss of market share.
   The democratic element of employee ownership is not always
apparent when union power and management control are
concentrated in the same hands. This also was illustrated by
ALPA's proposed United takeover agreement. The agreement
reduces the seniority ranking of the pilots who were hired
during its 1985 strike against United (or who crossed its
picket line). After the strike, ALPA attempted to have pilot
trainees, who were not on the payroll during the strike,
placed ahead on the seniority list of those who had worked
during the strike. The courts struck this down.
   The proposed machinists union agreement also exhibits
unbridled union power. It sets terms and conditions for
nonunion employees, for whom the IAM has no legal right to
bargain. Most startling and sad is that the IAM deal gives
this union carte blanche to organize the thousands of
United's nonunion clerical and reservations employees who
have steadfastly remained nonunion and supported management.
Unionization of this group will certainly not reduce costs.
More significant is the desertion by current management of
the employees who have supported it over the years. Such a
deal is a clear demonstration of management subservience to
union power.
   The unions have made much of their "concessions" as proof
that the takeover financing would be viable. But a close look
questions that claim.
   Each of the proposed contracts of the three unions are for
five-year periods, and promise no strikes. For most
employees, these contracts establish "book" wage increases of
4% a year, and then make "concessions" by providing wage
increases of 2% a year compounded. Also included are a
probable restoration of the fourth- and fifth-year book rates
in lump-sum form, and the right to negotiate -- or send to
arbitration -- proposals for higher increases.
   These vaunted "concessions" are in fact guaranteed wage
increases, regardless of business conditions for airline
employees whose compensation averages 65% above the industry
generally. The takeover will thus be saddled with
ever-increasing wage costs, which cast some doubt on the
takeover's viability.
   Thus, while employee ownership and self-management may
make sense in certain instances, the concept should not be
glamorized to the point where all forms are blindly accepted
as being more "democratic" and making economic sense. When
union power and management control are concentrated in the
same hands, the result, as may soon be demonstrated in the
UAL deal, is likely to lead neither to fiscal responsibility
nor to more democratic participation by individual workers.

   Credit Rating:
   Moody's Lowers
   Its Ratings on Debt
   Of Chrysler Corp.

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.
lowered its rating of Chrysler Corp. debt to Moody's lowest
investment grade level. The move affects $22.28 billion of
debt.
   The move follows a downgrading of Chrysler debt ratings by
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. two weeks ago. "This isn't the first
shot out of the barrel," a Chrysler spokesman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moody's said its move reflects an assessment that Chrysler
will have less "financial flexibility" in the future. Moody's
said the auto maker is likely to have weaker earnings and
cash flow while incurring large capital and
product-development expenditures. Chrysler's first-quarter
earnings fell 80% to $71 million, or 32 cents a share, from a
year earlier.
   Moody's made its announcement after the stock market
closed Friday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Chrysler closed unchanged at $15.75.
   In a statement, Chrysler said that it was "deeply
disappointed" with the downgrading and that the Moody's
decision was "not warranted by the facts." The company said
it was ironic that Moody's would criticize its aggressive
product development plans because U.S. corporations for years
have been criticized for taking the short-term view.
   The action pushed Chrysler's senior debt rating down one
notch above speculative grade. Moody's downgraded ratings on
Chrysler senior debt and its shelf registration to Baa-3 from
Baa-2. Moody's handed out an identical downgrading to the
ratings on senior debt of Chrysler Financial Corp., the
company's finance unit and currently its chief profit center.
   Chrysler criticized the downgrading of its financial
unit's commercial paper. Chrysler Financial has a "continuing
record of profitability, and the highest level of cash and
marketable securities in the corporation's history," the
company said.
   The finance unit, which is responsible for $18 billion of
the $22.28 billion of debt affected by the ratings move, has
posted record earnings for six consecutive years. Chrysler
officials are predicting record second-quarter earnings for
the unit.

   Where does the small investor go
   When the market sharply declines?
   Once the stocks reach their bottom,
   He moves to the sidelines.
   And there he prudently stays
   Through each daily groan and creak,
   And then boldly rushes in
   As the market reaches peak.

   Bank of Boston Sets
   Holder Rights Plan
   To Block Takeovers

   BOSTON -- Bank of Boston adopted a stockholder rights
plan, adding to its defenses against possible takeovers
attempts.
   The plan's many provisions are triggered if any person or
group buys 15% or more of the common shares. At that point,
existing stockholders have the right to purchase newly issued
shares at "a substantial discount," diluting the position of
anyone attempting an unwanted takeover, company officials
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As with the other New England banks, Bank of Boston has
reason to be defensive, analysts say. Its first-quarter
profit fell to $44 million, less than half of what it was in
the quarter a year ago. Bank of Boston's return on assets of
0.46% and return on equity of 8% are well below what many
major banks earn, said James Moynihan, an analyst with Advest
Group Inc.
   "Given the decade we've just gone through it makes sense
to be defensive," says Bank of Boston spokesman Wayne J.
Taylor, "to be protective of the long-term share value of the
company."
   Bank of Boston officials have lobbied against a bill
passed Friday by the Massachusetts Legislature that opens the
state to nationwide interstate banking. (The bill now awaits
signing by the governor.) Executives have said they will opt
for a provision in the bill allowing banks to not participate
in interstate banking until 1992.
   Analysts point out that these defensive moves are more for
future protection than for any current threat.
   "At this point, who would want to buy it?" says Carol
Berger, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence, noting the general
economic problems in New England. "It'd be like bidding into
a blind pool of risk."

   A Warning to Gas Men

   German businessman Jurgen Hippenstiel-Imhausen got what he
deserved -- a five-year prison term for crimes revolving
around the delivery to Libya of materials for a plant capable
of producing lethal chemical weapons. Most of the sentence
was for tax evasion, but the case sends a warning signal to
other potential Western suppliers of poison-gas technology.
   The case reflects a disturbing increase in attempts by
some nations to secure chemical and biological warfare (CBW)
capabilities. The Cold War is thawing, or so it seems, but
there still are plenty of potential aggressors in the world
who want to intimidate their neighbors. One means is cheap,
accessible and easily camouflaged: poison gas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chemical weapons have been around for a long time.
Biological weapons, potentially more lethal and harder to
protect against, have come along more recently. Over the past
decade, we have cited many times on these pages the evidence
of the use of "yellow rain," most likely a Soviet-produced
biological toxin, by the Laotian and Vietnamese governments
against Hmong rebels in Laos. There also is evidence that the
Soviets used CBW briefly in the early stages of the Afghan
war. Iraq's use of poison gas against Iranian soldiers at one
point in the Iraq-Iran war and more recently against Kurdish
rebel forces were well-documented cases. In his interview
with the Journal's Karen Elliot House (excerpted nearby),
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein expressed his willingness to
use his CBW inventories against Israel if provoked (see
related story: "On the Record: Iraq Weighs Threat of War" --
WSJ July 2, 1990).
   There also is the risk of these deadly agents falling into
terrorist hands or being used by a national leader against
populated areas as a mad gesture of defiance. Acquisitions of
CBW agents are accompanied by intensified efforts to obtain
ballistic missile technologies, which greatly expand the area
a potential aggressor can threaten. More than a dozen
less-developed countries have chemical weapons and ballistic
missiles, according to U.S. and Soviet sources.
   Caging the chemical weapon is even trickier than
containing the nuclear one. Chemical technology is relatively
simple and doesn't pose the radiation dangers inherent in
nuclear processing. Production is easy to disguise through
claims that a plant is making herbicides, insecticides or
fertilizers.
   Plugs for the proliferation bottle have proved leaky.
Negotiations for a full international convention have been in
process since 1969, and continue in Geneva. But the
impossibility of verifying compliance casts doubt on these
and other such efforts.
   One thing that the Hippenstiel-Imhausen case makes clear,
however, is that it is too early to abandon Western controls,
mostly under COCOM, on the export of weapons technology.
Prosecution might have been harder had the German
manufacturer not violated German export control laws in
addition to his tax-law infringements. Responsible chemical
companies could perhaps further control efforts, and possibly
head off intrusive regulation, by setting up voluntary
inspection programs. Strengthened controls on missile
technology might help as well, although the difficulty of
stopping countries such as China from exporting rockets has
become evident.
   Because of the verification problem, but also because of
languor, the Western alliance has been slow to acknowledge
and try to deal with CBW proliferation. There has been
insufficient recognition of the fact that modern technology
can make small aggressors lethal enough to be taken
seriously. We hope the Hippenstiel-Imhausen case reflects an
improved recognition of the threat.

   Merrill Lynch Asks: How Much Risk Can You Take?

   NEW YORK -- When it comes to investing, how much risk can
you stomach?
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. wants to know.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In coming weeks, the nation's biggest brokerage firm will
begin asking the individual investors behind its 7.2 million
retail accounts to decide for themselves just how aggressive
they're really willing to be in buying stocks, bonds and
other investments.
   With the new setup, individual investors will be asked to
put themselves in one of four risk categories: "conservative
for income," "conservative for growth," "moderate risk" and
"aggressive risk." Each category will have its own
recommended asset allocation, or investment mix.
   Merrill Lynch isn't the only securities firm that wants
investors to state more explicitly how willing they are to
risk losing money in the pursuit of profit. Earlier this
year, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., General Electric Co.'s brokerage
unit, adopted a five-category asset-allocation model. Some
other brokerage firms say they're looking at such setups,
too.
   Getting investors to pigeonhole themselves in this way can
be a good thing because it forces them to come to grips with
their feelings about risk. And it gives their stock brokers
formal written notice about these desires. The customer's
choice "goes into the record," says George Grune, managing
director of Kidder Peabody's asset management group.
   At the same time, getting investors on record about their
risk tolerances is likely to make it easier for a brokerage
firm to defend itself if it gets hit with lawsuits or
arbitration claims by investors who don't like what their
brokers are doing.
   An investor who picks the "aggressive risk" category, for
example, is agreeing to "move aggressively among asset
classes" and deal in "speculative and high-risk issues,"
according to guidelines distributed to Merrill Lynch brokers
last week. Such an investor might have a difficult time
claiming that his or her broker was too aggressive.
   Legal issues like that are a growing concern on Wall
Street. Over the past year, brokerage firms have been forced
to pay increasingly stiff punitive-damage awards in
arbitration cases brought by disgruntled investors.
   Brokers are required by securities law to make sure
customers are put into "suitable" investments. Unsuitability
lawsuits are brought when it's alleged that a broker knew, or
should have known, that an investment wasn't consistent with
a client's investment objectives.
   Merrill Lynch officials stress that such legal concerns
aren't the main reason for the new system, although they
don't deny they are a factor. The officials say they mainly
wanted to be more "flexible" with the firm's asset-allocation
recommendations, tailoring the research department's advice
on the markets to an investor's general profile.
   Avoiding customer disputes is "one of the side benefits,
but that's not why it was created in the first place," says
John Steffens, president of Merrill Lynch's
individual-investor operations. "`The Street,' in my view, in
general has dealt with this whole asset-allocation subject a
little bit too simplistically," he says.
   Sam Scott Miller, a New York securities lawyer, says
getting investors to segment themselves according to risk
preferences is a "sound and prudent approach" to heading off
legal disputes, providing the firms monitor the systems well.
Not only should it protect the firm in disputes with
customers, it might also be an early warning to a securities
firm if one of its brokers is pushing customers into
unsuitable investments. If a certain broker "brings in all
`aggressive' accounts, they're going to want to take a look
at it," he says.
   Some of Merrill Lynch's competitors have less-formal ways
of tailoring asset-allocation recommendations. Firms
including St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. and
Raymond James &amp; Associates Inc., St. Petersburg, Fla.,
already have more than one asset-allocation model for
different investor profiles. But they don't ask investors to
commit formally to one or the other.
   "There is a temptation with asset allocation to put the
retail client into a profile," says Raymond Worseck,
investment strategy coordinator at A.G. Edwards, which has
decided not to institute a formal system like Merrill
Lynch's. Such a system has "compliance pluses" for brokerage
firms, "because it protects them legally from a risk
standpoint." But the investor can sometimes be better served
with a more personalized approach, he says.
   Merrill Lynch emphasizes that getting investors to specify
their risk tolerance is only a beginning for grooming an
investor's portfolio. Once an investor picks a risk category,
the broker uses computer models and other tools to build a
portfolio of appropriate stocks and bonds. Investors can
switch risk categories, but frequent switching isn't
encouraged, Merrill Lynch officials say.
   Charles Clough, Merrill Lynch's chief investment
strategist, says he realizes there are critics of his firm's
plan. "You could say a multitude of asset guidelines just
adds to the confusion of the issue," he says. But Mr. Clough
adds that having the set categories helps to organize
investors whose risk profiles otherwise would be "all over
the map."
   (On Friday, Mr. Clough said that Merrill Lynch's benchmark
asset-allocation -- for a large balanced corporate pension
fund or endowment -- would be shifted a bit toward stocks
effective today: 50% stocks, 45% bonds and the rest cash,
instead of 45% stocks and 50% bonds. Mr. Clough said the
shift didn't represent a major policy change by bond-bullish
Merrill Lynch, but only an "adjustment because bonds have had
a good rally" and stocks have declined recently. The
weightings of the four new individual-investor categories
weren't changed.)

   A new book titled "Switzerland Washes Whiter" is provoking
outrage among many Swiss.
   The work, by Jean Ziegler, attacks money laundering, which
the author claims supports Swiss society. "Switzerland is our
planet's principal junction for money laundering, the
recycling of the profits of death," the book says.
   Already a best-seller at home and due to appear soon in 14
languages abroad, the book has prompted lawsuits, death
threats, villification in the media (the tabloid Blick called
the author a "bird that fouls its own nest") and a statement
from the Swiss Bankers Association saying that "Swiss banking
secrecy . . . does not protect criminals."
   The Swiss passed a law last year under which anyone
knowingly hiding the origins of illegal profits faces a fine
or imprisonment. But Mr. Ziegler isn't impressed. Under the
law, "The banker or his employee must have direct knowledge

   HIGH-SPEED TRAINS FOR POLAND
                                                                                                       

   The French national railroad has signed a five-year
cooperation accord with Poland to provide advice on how to
develop a high-speed rail network. The accord proposes a
study of how to boost the average speed of Poland's trains to
125 miles an hour. One of France's high-speed trains recently
set the world speed record at 320 miles an hour. In addition
to technology, the accord deals with maintenance practices
and the use of computers.
                                                                                                       

   NEW FRENCH NATIONALIZATION?

   France's ruling Socialists proposed the first
nationalization since they regained power in 1988. The bill
to give the state control of nuclear-power-plant maker
Framatome S.A. appears to mark the end of the Socialists'
self-imposed moratorium on nationalizations and
privatizations, and could herald more restructuring of French
industry. The move also punctuates a long-running dispute
between the Finance Ministry and Cie. Generale d'Electricite,
France's big telephone and electrical equipment maker, which
in June boosted its Framatome stake to a majority 52%, from
its previous 40%. The government controls 45% and 3% belongs
to employees.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH CENSUS
                                                                                                       

   A new census shows France having a population of
58,452,500, including 1,896,500 in its overseas possessions.
That's a net increase of more than two million from the
previous census eight years ago. The population of
metropolitan France -- excluding overseas regions -- is
56,556,000, compared with 54,335,000 in 1982. The two largest
cities are Paris with 2,147,000 residents and Marseille with
803,000. Paris lost about 30,000 residents since 1982 and
Marseille about 70,000.
                                                                                                       

   TOYOTA TALKS TO BRAZIL
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. is considering a $2 billion
investment to build motors and small trucks in Brazil, the
Brazilian government said. The president of Toyota's
Brazilian subsidiary met last week with Economy Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello to discuss the project, a ministry
spokesman said. Toyota is interested in producing 20,000
vehicles and 100,000 motors a year in Brazil, the spokesman
said. Toyota currently makes 6,000 jeeps a year at a plant
near Sao Paulo.
                                                                                                       

   HELP FOR PORTUGAL'S TAXPAYERS
                                                                                                       

   Portugal will pay 14% interest on reimbursements for tax
overpayments. A new decree says "the state must not demand
from its citizens . . . more stringent behavior than it
imposes on itself." Portugal has in the past demanded
interest on late tax payments, but reimbursed overpayments
without interest. "That is an unjust situation," read the
decree.
                                                                                                       

   GESTURE FROM SOUTH KOREA
                                                                                                       

   South Korea will open its borders to goods and transport
from North Korea to help advance reunification of the two
countries, President Roh Tae Woo said.
   "The administration will unrestrictedly allow the inflow
from and through the North of aircraft, ships and other means
of transport, as well as goods," he said. He also said his
government would set up an economic-cooperation fund to help
finance trade with North Korea, the Soviet Union and
socialist nations in Eastern Europe.
   South Korea has allowed imports of North Korean goods
since Mr. Roh announced a policy shift in July 1988,
promising assistance to Pyongyang in improving relations with
the U.S., Japan and Seoul's other allies. However, only
selected goods are allowed in and must be shipped through
third countries.
   In his speech, Mr. Roh promised more democratic reforms
and urged South Koreans to pay more attention to unification
with North Korea.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The Netherlands will soon require visas from citizens of
Peru, Colombia and Bolivia in a drive to curb drug smuggling
from South America, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. . .
. In New Zealand, Penny Jamieson became Anglican bishop of
Dunedin, the country's southernmost diocese, and thus became
the world's first woman to be an Anglican diocesan bishop.
Whakahuihui Vercoe, Anglican bishop of Aotearoa and a Maori,
didn't attend the ceremony; he said New Zealand's native
Maori people were not culturally ready for a woman bishop.

   Revamping Plan
   Set by Integrated
   Resources Inc.

   NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc., the former real
estate syndicator operating under bankruptcy court
protection, is informally circulating a reorganization plan
to its creditors.
   Although details of the plan are still being negotiated,
officials and creditors say Integrated envisions a three-step
process whereby creditors initially would share between $300
million and $350 million in cash raised largely through asset
sales. The company currently has more than $200 million in
cash in escrow.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Integrated, which largely manages more than 600
partnerships, then would segregate its contract rights to
manage those partnerships and issue notes against them.
Integrated estimates the contract rights at about $200
million; the company would seek to sell the rights over a
three-year period and then distribute proceeds to creditors.
   Creditors also would share an equity interest in the
remaining company, which would specialize in hotel management
and equipment leasing. Officials estimate that business to be
valued at about $200 million. The company already has been
scaling back its operating expenses and expects substantial
reductions by year end. More staff reductions were made
Friday, and officials expect the number of employees to be
reduced from the current 500 to about 275 by year end.
   The plan hasn't been widely distributed to creditors, who
are owed a total of about $1.8 billion. Those who have seen
the plan are expected to respond to Integrated next week.
Creditors seem generally satisfied about the speed with which
the case is proceeding. Integrated entered bankruptcy
proceedings in February; the federal Bankruptcy Court
directed Integrated to submit a disclosure statement to
creditors that should provide terms of the reorganization by
July 26. Integrated's "exclusivity period," the time period
in which only it can officially propose a reorganization plan
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, expires
Sept. 11.
   Both Integrated officials and creditors view the
resolution of issues among various creditor groups as the
next big hurdle the company has to surmount in fashioning a
plan. Although the overall plan has been set out, it isn't
clear how the cash, notes and equity ultimately will be
distributed among creditors.
   Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated chairman and chief
executive officer, has said senior creditors, who are owed a
total of about $1 billion, probably would receive about 45
cents to 50 cents on the dollar. It's unclear what junior
creditors, who are owed about $600 million, might receive,
but it would be "substantially less" than what senior
creditors can expect. There are about $200 million in general
unsecured claims.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   Mr. Bush's Leadership

<LP>
   Early Friday morning, President Bush held a news
conference to try to answer some of the criticism that
followed his break with the pledge not to raise taxes, made
in front of the millions who watched his nomination to the
presidency. It was not a good performance. For the first time
since his election, the President showed no signs of his
customary buoyancy. Mr. Bush sounded apologetic and, worse,
defensive.
   The Bush presidency has reached a turning point. The
choice before Mr. Bush is whether to pursue a presidency of
economic growth or a presidency of conventional economics and
conventional politics. This is a crucially important
distinction, which to this day is not yet understood in
Washington or by many White House officials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The past three elections have been won by presidential
campaigns of economic growth. With the exception of Jack Kemp
and Pete du Pont, all of the opponents who ran against Mr.
Bush and Ronald Reagan -- both Democrats and Republicans --
represented conventional economic policies in which notions
such as outlays, receipts, deficits and interest rates are
all levers in a Rube Goldberg machine that fine-tunes and
pump-primes the economy.
   The candidates who won all three elections had a different
view. They made it clear that they understood the determining
role of taxes in a modern, highly competitive economy. If
taxes are cut (the Reagan presidency) or aren't increased
(the Bush promise), the economy's success is primarily in the
hands of the voters. This was the supply-side view. But if
taxes are being raised, the economy is being taken out of the
voters' hands and turned over to the Members of Congress.
   The President now seems to believe that events compel him
to stretch between these two poles. The danger is that if he
slips, he may emerge as the leader of the people whose
economic policies he defeated. The voters he led against new
congressional taxation will feel, with some justification,
that they've been abandoned.
   Mr. Bush said at his news conference that he thinks he
deserves support for this new course, a "make-or-break effort
at responsible government." Perhaps. After his
pledge-shattering announcement we expressed support for what
we took to be his definition of responsible government --
real reform of entitlements and so-called mandatory programs,
institutional reform of the budget process, new enforcement
mechanisms and a capital-gains cut, with taxes of some sort
as the price for this achievement. But there was none of this
in the news conference.
   Instead, Mr. Bush said a sequester would cause big cuts in
"student grants and a wide array of other domestic services."
Student grants? We took Mr. Bush's statement last Tuesday to
mean that cutting middle-class entitlements was a fundamental
goal of budget reform. If it isn't, what are we talking
about? The word coming out of the White House now is that it
is no longer interested in pursuing the line-item veto over
spending because Mr. Bush's advisers fear that the Democrats
will embarrass the President by forcing him to use it too
frequently. So where's the real reform?
   We worry that this budget summit is likely to proceed
along very conventional lines. The President on Friday
continuously cited the deficit as the reason for dropping his
pledge against new taxes. But if the deficit argument is
compelling enough to make him talk himself out of his
virtually sacred tax pledge, how long can it be before he's
talked himself out of real budget reform?
   We've always been struck at how successful conventional
Washington has been at putting the word "deficit" at the
center of the debate instead of "spending." That's
intentional. It is a strategy for making no lasting changes
in a corrupt system. It's a strategy for turning the budget
summit away from fundamental, long-term reform and fixating
solely on a number -- the $50 billion Holy Grail. The record
shows that Congress knows how to do this. But nothing about
its world really changes, and we soon end up back in the same
spending swamp, with the S&amp;L crisis replaced by some other
expensive screw-up, and the American people asked to support
a tax increase.
   There is a real question to be raised here about the state
of American politics. It isn't clear to us whether the
President appreciates how despondent the simple breaking of
his promise has left the electorate. Forget the economics. It
now appears that for many voters Mr. Bush and his tax pledge
were going to be one, rare instance of a modern politician
keeping his word. We were very struck after the recent
California balloting by a New York Times piece exploring the
reasons for another low voter turnout. One non-voter simply
said, "I find voting totally useless. The big wheels are
going to manipulate the system anyway." Our sense is that
this corrosive loss of trust in politics and politicians is
spreading fast in the U.S.
   People pay taxes willingly when they think they can trust
the government. They also might understand how Mr. Bush could
go back on his word if he could show that he got something in
return. But it was evident from the news conference that as
of now he has nothing. If, after breaking his pledge, he
comes away from these politicians with little more than a
run-of-the-mill deficit-reduction deal, we suspect it will be
bad for Mr. Bush's leadership, bad for his party and bad for
the relationship between the government and its citizens.

assume day-to-day operating responsibility for the company.
   Mr. Cox said in a statement that he plans to remain
chairman and a board member, and will retain contact with the
company's key accounts. Mr. Cox founded Emulex in 1979, and
has spent 30 years in the electronics and computer industry.
The release didn't explain why Mr. Cox is stepping aside, and
company officials couldn't be reached for comment.

   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- Texaco Inc. named Peter I. Bijur
president of its European operations.
   The appointment, effective in November, is a major step up
for the 48-year-old executive, who for the past year has been
running the company's U.K. operations. Before that, Mr. Bijur
was chief executive officer of Texaco Canada Inc. until it
was sold as part of Texaco's restructuring. In 1984, he drew
the difficult task of selling assets related to Texaco's
acquisition of Getty Oil Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In his new post, Mr. Bijur will succeed Paul B. Hicks Jr.,
64, who is retiring after 37 years with Texaco. Mr. Hicks has
served as a senior vice president of Texaco Inc. in addition
to being president of Texaco Europe.
   Mr. Bijur, a Texaco employee for 24 years, will take
charge of Texaco Europe at a crucial time. Right now,
international oil companies are vying for business in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union. "These areas are the new
frontier because they've been closed for so long," Mr. Bijur
said.
   Although Western Europe will remain the primary focus for
Texaco Europe, Mr. Bijur said his operation will aggressively
seek opportunities in Eastern bloc countries as they shed
government structures that have kept the countries from
striking up business relations with Western companies.
   Texaco has already established a task force to look for
opportunities as those countries open up. The company
recently reached an agreement with the Soviet government to
use computers for geological research, and is pursuing
possible marketing arrangements there.

   Kay Is Expected
   To Get Offer
   From Ratners

   Ratners Group PLC, an aggressively expanding British
jewelry chain, is expected to make a friendly offer for
troubled Kay Jewelers Inc., a jewelry chain with nearly 500
stores nationwide.
   Officials at Kay and at Ratners's investment bank declined
to comment on London newspaper reports that an agreement will
be announced soon. "Right now, I can't comment on it," said
Roldan Fernandez, Kay's chief financial officer. Bob Dowsett,
an investment banker at Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, a Ratners
takeover adviser, said the investment bank had "no comment"
on the acquisition reports. "I think it would be pretty
unusual for a British company to comment like that on a
Sunday," said Mr. Dowsett.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ratners was prepared to pay as much as $200 million and
assume a roughly equal amount in debt, according to London
newspapers. Kay's stock closed at $10.875 a share, up 50
cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday. At that price, the company's common outstanding have
a value of about $135.4 million.
   Kay, based in Alexandria, Va., is one of the nation's
biggest sellers of fine jewelry, including diamonds, gold
jewelry and watches. In addition to Kay Jewelers stores, the
company operates the upscale Black, Starr &amp; Frost chain; J.B.
Robinson, concentrated in the Midwest, and Marcus &amp; Co., an
operator of jewelry departments in major stores. Kay's
concentration has been the middle market with most of its
stores in suburban and regional shopping malls. Last year,
battered by competitors' aggressive discounting and a heavy
debt load, its profits sank to $196,000 from nearly $11
million on revenue of $426.6 million.
   Kay, which has been built rapidly on debt, experienced a
credit crunch this spring. Between mid-March and mid-May,
four of Kay's lenders pulled about $16.5 million in credit
lines and three of them sought to withdraw $32 million more.
Last week, Kay announced that it arranged an $80 million
revolving credit agreement to meet working capital needs
through January, and it said the three banks were
participating. The agreement replaced an $86 million line of
credit. Kay also said that three directors invested $5
million in the company and planned to invest another $5
million later this year.
   Ratners, which owns the Sterling Inc. jewelry chain with
about 360 stores in the U.S., has long been mentioned as a
possible suitor for Kay. But Kay's junk bonds, totaling about
$150 million, have been a deterrent.
   Ratners has eagerly sought a U.S. acquisition since last
year, when talks to acquire the Gordons jewelry chain broke
down, according to British analysts. (Gordons was purchased
by Zale Corp., a unit of Peoples Jewellers Ltd. of Canada.)
Ratners management has told analysts it wants to expand its
U.S. operation to 1,500 stores and a 10% share of America's
$12 billion jewelry market, dominated by local chains and
individual outlets.
   For Ratners, the U.S. investment would mark a huge
expansion at a time many British retailers are reeling from
Britain's high-interest rate, inflation-ridden economy.
Ratners would be following a high-risk strategy because some
British marketers have found it difficult to bring their
style of so-called high-street, or main street, retailing to
American shopping centers and malls.

   The big beverage companies will post higher second-quarter
earnings, on the continued strength of low-calorie drinks and
on the successful introduction of several new beers.
   Coca-Cola Co. is expected to post an earnings gain of
about 18%, analysts estimate. PepsiCo Inc. and Anheuser-Busch
Cos. are seen having increases of at least 10%. Adolph Coors
Co. may report a 20% boost in earnings. After a gain from the
sale of an Ohio business, bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.
is also expected to report higher net income.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts expect Coca-Cola, which generates the bulk of its
earnings abroad, to show a 6% to 7% increase in concentrate
shipments overseas. That's below the company's typical goal
of 8% to 10%, but analysts noted that much of the decline
resulted from continued economic deterioration in Argentina
and Brazil. Outside those countries, Coca-Cola's overseas
shipments rose 9%, estimates Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. The second-quarter results compare with a
strong period a year earlier, in which shipments increased
15%.
   Coca-Cola is expected to show strong volume gains in
Europe, a critical geographic stronghold for the company,
particularly in France and Spain. Coca-Cola has made a big
push in France since it acquired the bulk of its French
distribution business last year. Separately, Coca-Cola said
its British joint venture opened a new plant in Wakefield,
England, on Thursday. The plant is the largest soft-drink
production facility in Europe.
   In the U.S., Coca-Cola's volume, measured in gallons, is
expected to inch up only 2% to 3%, analysts estimate, while
PepsiCo is expected to post an increase of about 5%.
Coca-Cola, which derives about one-third of its volume from
fountain accounts, has been hurt by softness in the
restaurant industry. But PepsiCo has been able to capitalize
on the fountain business because PepsiCo's own restaurants
have been outperforming most others, says Martin Romm, an
analyst with First Boston Corp.
   Additionally, analysts said, PepsiCo benefited from
stronger sales of recently reformulated Diet Pepsi and from a
smoother execution of its summer marketing programs,
including the sale of specially designed Pepsi cans, called
"Cool Cans." Coke has had a rougher ride. Earlier this month,
amid bad publicity, the company abandoned its MagiCans
promotion. Some of the cans, which contained currency and
coupons redeemable for prizes, proved to be defective. Mr.
Romm said he believed the promotion had a "modest" impact on
volume. But a spokesman for Coca-Cola said the MagiCans
promotion had "no negative impact. If anything, MagiCans
contributed to the up side" of sales, the spokesman said.
   In the second quarter, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola will earn
58 cents to 60 cents a share, according to analysts'
estimates, compared with 49 cents, adjusted for a stock
split, a year earlier.
   PepsiCo, of Purchase, N.Y., will earn about $1.10 to $1.15
a share in the quarter, despite an estimated four cents a
share in earnings dilution from acquisitions. The higher
earnings, boosted by stronger restaurant and snack-food
sales, compares with the $1 a share PepsiCo reported a year
earlier.
   Discounting a gain and certain one-time charges, Coca-Cola
Enterprises apparently will show another decrease in
operating earnings. The company's earnings have been
disappointing for several quarters because soft-drink price
increases haven't covered the bottler's rising costs for
marketing and raw materials.
   Several analysts expect the bottler's per-share earnings
from operations to be about 21 cents to 24 cents. Those
figures don't include a gain from the sale of an Ohio
bottling property and certain charges that, taken together,
will result in a net per-share gain of 15 cents. In the
year-ago quarter, Coca-Cola Enterprises reported per-share
net income of 26 cents. A company spokesman noted that that
figure included about three cents in income related to the
sale of property and a repurchase of bonds.
   In the quarter, Anheuser-Busch, St. Louis, is expected to
report earnings of 90 cents to 92 cents a share, compared
with 82 cents in the quarter a year ago. The company's beer
shipments increased a moderate 3% or so, as the brewer
boosted sales with new products, including Bud Dry and Busch
Draft Light. Mr. Romm said Anheuser-Busch continued to enjoy
sales growth at the expense of smaller competitors.
   Coors, of Golden, Colo., is expected to report that
earnings increased to between 55 cents and 60 cents, from 46
cents a year earlier. Led by sales of Keystone, Keystone
Light and Coors Light, Coors is expected to show an 18% jump
in beer shipments in the quarter.

   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department said it is examining
charges by a former thrift regulator that the government
delayed closing Silverado Bank, Savings &amp; Loan, Denver, until
after the 1988 presidential election because Neil Bush, the
president's son, had been a board member.
   Kermit Mowbray, a former federal regulator in Colorado,
said that in the fall of 1988, his office received a phone
call ordering the regional regulators to delay closing
Silverado until after the November election. Mr. Mowbray, in
testimony before a congressional committee two weeks ago,
said he couldn't remember who made the call or who actually
received it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Washington S&amp;L regulators have claimed that the huge
number of insolvent S&amp;Ls caused a delay in closing dozens of
thrifts during that time, including Silverado. Losses at
Silverado are expected to total roughly $1 billion.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, which was made an arm of
the Treasury under the S&amp;L cleanup law, last week requested
the Treasury's inspector general to investigate the charges.
   Thrift regulators are currently pursuing an administrative
action against Neil Bush, charging that he didn't disclose
his business relationship with several large Silverado
borrowers while he was a director from 1985 to August 1988.
At a news conference last week, President Bush said he has
"full confidence in the integrity and honor of my son."

   In your May 30 page-one article "Seeds of Change: Farmers,
Eying Costs and the Environment, Limit Use of Chemicals" you
are generally on the mark with the conclusions that farmers
are trying to apply fertilizer and chemicals more
effectively.
   There has been a great deal of emphasis on the appropriate
application rate of fertilizer, particularly nitrogen
fertilizers, that may lead to high nitrate levels in the
water supply if applied indiscriminately. However, your
suggestion that fertilizer use per acre on corn dropped 8%
last year due to this phenomenon is subject to other
interpretation. For example, the drought in 1988 reduced
yields and fertilizer uptake in many areas. As a result,
there was a substantial amount of fertilizer carry-over from
1988 to 1989, the most likely reason farmers applied less
fertilizer in 1989. This may also be the reason some farmers
were able to slash their fertilizer use substantially and
still obtain high yields.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I also take exception to the statement that "many farmers
were afraid of putting something into the ground that could
knock them dead if they inhaled it," in reference to
anhydrous ammonia. Having applied anhydrous ammonia
fertilizer on many acres as a young man, I can assure you
that inhaling it does not knock anybody dead. If it did, this
is a ghost composing this letter. As with other gases, if it
is in such heavy concentration that it replaces the oxygen,
one could be asphyxiated from the lack of oxygen.

   Brunswick Mining
   Employees Reject
   Pact, Begin Strike

   TORONTO -- More than 1,100 mine workers at Brunswick
Mining &amp; Smelting Corp.'s zinc and lead mine began striking
after voting to reject what the company has called its
"final" contract offer.
   Meantime, contract talks covering 3,500 workers at
Vancouver, British Columbia-based Cominco Ltd. continued
through the weekend after workers last week voted down the
company's latest offer and authorized the union bargaining
committee to call a strike. A union spokesman said the union
plans to continue bargaining at least until tomorrow.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Workers at both companies are represented by local
affiliates of the United Steelworkers of America. Contracts
at both companies expired Saturday.
   Cominco and Brunswick Mining, 64%-owned by Toronto's
Noranda Inc., are Canada's largest and second largest
producers of zinc and lead. Prices of these metals on world
markets were bolstered last week in anticipation of a
possible strike, and analysts expect a cutoff of zinc and
lead supplies from either company could boost prices further.
   Picket lines went up at the Brunswick mine near Bathurst,
New Brunswick, yesterday, said Larry Urbanoski, a
superintendent at the mine. "We're going through a process of
arranging an orderly shutdown of the plant," he said. As of
midday yesterday, there weren't any new talks scheduled
between the union and the company, he said.
   Blair Doucet, president of Local 5385 of the United
Steelworkers, said late last week that the two sides are
"still quite a ways away" from reaching agreement. He said
workers rejected Brunswick Mining's offer, which includes a
20% wage boost over three years and increased monthly pension
payments, because they are determined to make up ground after
the company "got away cheap" in the last round of talks.
   Brunswick Mining officials couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Brunswick Mining estimates its production of zinc and lead
accounts for roughly 5% and 1.5%, respectively, of Western
world output.
   Cominco produces about 5.8% of the Western world's refined
zinc, and 2.6% of the West's lead, at its big Trail, British
Columbia, smelter complex. Cominco also owns British
Columbia's Sullivan lead-zinc mine, where output was
suspended earlier this year due to operating losses.

   Video Stores Try
   Sharper Focus
   In Market Glut

   If you want to watch "Batman" on your home videocassette
recorder, nearly every video store has a copy for rent. But
if your taste runs to stomach-turning cult movies such as
"Horrors of the Black Museum" or "Blood Feast," Video Vault
in Alexandria, Va., has them to go.
   "Guaranteed Worst Movies in Town" is Video Vault's slogan.
Owner Jim McCabe notes proudly that his inventory of film
turkeys on video also includes "Scum of the Earth," "Kill
Baby Kill" and several copies of "Plan 9 From Outer Space,"
which, he adds, "is considered the worst movie of all time."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stocking hard-to-find cult movie classics is Video Vault's
way of attracting attention in the maturing and overcrowded
retail video industry. Growth in the rental business has
slowed, and rentals per household fell last year from 1986.
Moreover, national or regional chains run by such companies
as Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and West Coast Video Ltd., Philadelphia, increasingly
dominate the field. But many single and dual outlet video
retailers are finding new ways to attract customers.
   The winning formulas typically involve marketing ideas,
such as Mr. McCabe's "worst movie" campaign, that set the
small stores apart from the cookie-cutter approach of the
chains. Other profit-making ideas from the video independents
include home delivery of video rentals, mail-order sales and
rentals, wide-ranging inventories and attention-getting
promotions to lure customers to the store.
   "The days of opening a store, putting posters in the
windows and having the customers flock in are gone," says Lou
Berg, owner of Audio-Video Plus in Houston.
   Single outlet video stores, once the staple of the
industry, now make up half of the nation's roughly 27,000
video retail outlets, says Paul Eisele, president of the
Fairfield Group, video industry consultants in Westport,
Conn. About 15% are owned by chains with 50 or more outlets,
and this sector is growing fast. The remaining stores belong
to smaller chains. A $50,000 investment used to be enough to
open a mom-and-pop video store. But Mr. Eisele says it now
takes $500,000 to open a state-of-the-art video superstore.
   Many of the small survivors entered the business in the
video boom years of the late 1970s and have had a decade to
win customer loyalty. But times have changed. These days,
says Michael Becker, owner of Video Room in New York City:
"You have to work at keeping your customer base." Otherwise,
he says, a new chain-store outlet, "with its advertising
clout, can knock you out of the box."
   A lot of single outlets crashed in the late 1980s. Some
lacked the money required to buy multiple copies of the
Hollywood hits that most customers want. Others were victims
of price-cutting and longer rental periods offered as
inducements by new chain outlets.
   But many have found ways to survive. A firm believer that
video shopping should be fun, Mr. Berg makes his two Houston
outlets attractions in themselves. An inflated gorilla
hanging from an Empire State Building replica over the front
door announced the arrival of "King Kong" on video. A
costumed Ninja Turtle greeted kiddies one weekend. When a
"Star Trek" video was released, Mr. Berg built a replica of
the Starship Enterprise's bridge and took pictures of
customers sitting in Capt. Kirk's chair.
   He also stresses an exhaustive inventory. "It's not the
size of the store, it's the breadth of the titles," Mr. Berg
says. His stores stock 23,000 different titles, compared with
roughly 8,000 for the average Blockbuster outlet. Mr. Berg
says Audio-Video Plus revenue is growing about 10% annually.
And though most stores depend on rentals, his derive about
70% of their revenue from sales of videos.
   "Don't kid yourself," says Video Vault's Mr. McCabe.
"You've got to carry the new movies." Specialties such as his
horror movie list "kind of enhance the image," he says.
   In New York, Mr. Becker plays to the ethnic, cosmopolitan
life style of Manhattan's Upper East Side by stocking some
1,200 foreign films, as well as the usual assortment of
American movies in his 11-year-old store. "The fewer times
you disappoint the customers, the less chance they have of
going elsewhere," he says.
   Since returning videos is an annoyance -- Mr. Berg in
Houston likens it to "taking your clothes to the dry
cleaners" -- Mr. Becker's Video Room uses bicycle messengers
to pick up and deliver videos from apartment house doormen.
His bike crew, weaving through Manhattan traffic, makes as
many as 600 deliveries on a busy Saturday.
   Jim Salzer, owner of Salzer's Video in Ventura, Calif., a
burgeoning coastal community north of Los Angeles, says he's
facing six new Blockbuster outlets in his market. "I've got
one factor on my side, and that's location," he says.
Salzer's Video, an addition to the record store he's run for
24 years, is next to a Highway 101 exit ramp that's used by
42,000 cars on an average day.
   Location isn't Mr. Salzer's only weapon. He spent $12,000
on a sort of video automatic teller machine tied to his
store's computer. It allows customers both to return and to
rent videos after business hours. Playing the fast-food and
merchandising angles, Mr. Salzer stocks beer, wine, ice
cream, potato chips, T-shirts and posters, in addition to
20,000 video titles. "A lot of people think we're crazy,
{but} we're looking at a real high profit margin," typically
a 50% markup on non-video items, Mr. Salzer says. Sales for
this year's first half have climbed 15% from a year earlier,
he says.
   Mail order is getting attention from video retailers.
Jerry Frebowitz, who has five Movies Unlimited stores in the
Philadelphia area, also has a 656-page catalog "loaded with
things you don't find in your video store: films from the
'50s, `The Brain That Wouldn't Die,' classic serials such as
Captain Marvel and Flash Gordon."
   In Alexandria, Mr. McCabe's Video Vault started renting
cult movies by mail this spring. "We're getting 50 phone
calls a day," he says. "I've got one {employee} who does
nothing but mail order." Customers pay a $19.95 membership
fee. Rentals cost $15 for three movies for three days. Mr.
McCabe says word of his service has spread through
underground horror genre magazines such as Gore Gazette and
Psychotronic Video.
   "I've got members in 35 states," he says, "and they
definitely aren't renting `Ferris Bueller's Day Off.'"

   If people ever questioned the power of the free press and
that of The Wall Street Journal in particular, they should be
aware of the Fibreboard story reported in your paper by Roger
Lowenstein (Heard on the Street, May 3).
   He detailed certain proposals that were counter to the
shareholders' interests, which were to be acted on at the
annual meeting being held on May 7. The reaction to the
article's disclosures was to ignite shareholders either to
cast their vote or change the one previously made. The
inspectors of the election got only three hours of sleep on
the night previous to the meeting because of the need to
recount the changed vote.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a direct result of the article, the contested proposal
did not receive a majority of the votes cast. It subsequently
has been rescinded by the company.
   On behalf of the thousands of shareholders of Fibreboard,
I would like to express our appreciation for the outstanding
coverage. It is a wonderful example of the power of the press
to inquire and disclose so that the reader can make an
informed judgment as to the merits of a matter.

<LP>
   George Melloan's timely reminder that "Class Struggle Will
Not End With Communism" (Global View, op-ed, May 21) suffers
from a reductionism that treats class struggle, a
political-economic phenomenon, only as a political force.
Class struggle, while manifesting itself in various forms in
the political arena, is an economic mechanism as well. It
exhibits itself more ostensibly when the disparity of wealth
and poverty takes a more visible toll on people's lives. As
such, it has always existed in societies with economic
classes, whether democratic or nondemocratic, capitalist or
communist. The existence of numerous lobbying organizations
in this country -- representing consumers, unions,
professions, industries, ethnic and racial groups and so on
-- is the best example, though a confused one, of how this
process works in Western societies.
   The decline of communism as a political force in Eastern
Europe should not be interpreted as the end of class struggle
in those countries. The very opposition to the political
elites ruling these societies is a manifestation of this
struggle. To view class struggle as a mere tool in the hands
of those who are hungry for power is to underestimate one of
the major forces shaping human history.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also, the fact that the Soviets were able to export
communism, in the name of class struggle, to Third World
countries had less to do with the appeal of this rhetoric to
"would-be-despots" than with the reality of economic
injustices perpetrated by powerful political and economic
elites, such as Batista, Somoza, Haile Selassie, etc. in
those societies.

   As an expatriate Englishwoman I read Mr. Melloan's article
with a mixture of amusement and despair. Amusement at the
wonderful eccentricity of my race, and despair at that
growing faction of British society raised to believe that
hard work is not necessarily a prerequisite to achieving a
comfortable living.
   Karl Marx, I am sure, would be appalled by that portion of
British society described by Mr. Melloan. "Workers of the
World Unite" meant just that, with the emphasis on workers;
and it meant fair and equitable return for a fair amount of
work. Those profiled in the article have in all probability
been unable to hold down any job and probably do not have any
desire to do so. By the same token, this type of person looks
with scorn upon others entrepreneurial enough to make a
financial success of their lives by working long, dedicated
hours.
   British schools, while generally instilling a love of
academia, do not follow through and instill drive and
ambition to excel in business. Unfortunately, those children
born into working- and lower-middle-class families who do
have ambition usually have to remove themselves to North
America to succeed.

   Gorbachev Is Likely
   To Get Hostile Reception

   MOSCOW -- The Politburo of the Soviet Communist Party used
to meet regularly on Thursdays to decide such diverse matters
as the invasion of Afghanistan and investment for the
nation's machinery industry. These days, when the Politburo
meets at all, it concentrates on party affairs.
   Staff at the party's Central Committee headquarters, long
accustomed to giving instructions that were immediately
obeyed, are far fewer in number and wield far less clout than
before. "The situation has changed radically from two, three
or five years ago," says one official. "People once viewed us
as gods. Now they listen to us only if we have something new
and interesting to propose."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such are the fruits of Mikhail Gorbachev's two-year
struggle to bring democracy to the Soviet Union. Slowly but
surely, the Soviet leader has moved to transfer political
power from the discredited Communist Party to a more
legitimate system of elected government. All the while, the
party has watched and -- at least publicly -- applauded.
   No longer. When the 28th Communist Party Congress opens
today in Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev is likely to face a hostile
audience. At that meeting, the highest body of party power
must decide whether to back his efforts to relegate the party
to a back seat, turning it into an organization that advises
on policy but neither dictates nor implements it.
   But in the weeks leading up to the meeting, particularly
at a conference of Russian Communists last month, hard-liners
have mounted a rear-guard action to preserve party power. For
the first time, they have openly criticized Mr. Gorbachev's
entire perestroika program, accusing him of selling out the
military, losing Eastern Europe to the capitalists and
driving the Soviet economy to the brink of collapse. Yegor
Ligachev, a conservative figurehead in the Politburo, has
even called for Mr. Gorbachev to resign as party leader.
   Such bitter attacks have sent a shiver through the nation,
forcing some of Mr. Gorbachev's aides to give soothing
reassurances. "The Congress won't settle the fate of
perestroika -- it will go on -- but the fate of the party
itself," Alexander Yakovlev, a Politburo member and Gorbachev
confidant told Pravda last week.
   But as Mr. Gorbachev himself concedes, the party is still
a powerful force to be reckoned with. He has created the
beginnings of a democratic system, including a feisty
parliament and a new-style presidency, but the party
apparatus continues to hold many of the levers of power. Mr.
Gorbachev conceded as much when he decided not to give up his
post as party leader to concentrate on the presidency.
   The Congress seems sure to be a feast of conservatism;
only an estimated 2% of delegates are radicals committed to
faster reforms. So far, the best guess is that Mr. Gorbachev
will cling to the middle ground, aligning himself with
moderate conservatives even if it means compromising on some
of his political reforms. But, frets Boris Bolotin, a
researcher at a Moscow think-tank, "Gorbachev's
maneuverability is at an end."
   The problem with trying to strike compromises with the
hard-liners is that it risks setting off defections by
liberals who are demanding a major overhaul of the party
itself. It could also seriously affect political stability,
leaving the Soviet Union with a messy system of government in
which the Communist Party and new democratic bodies struggle
for control.
   Signs of that struggle already abound. In Moscow,
Leningrad and elsewhere, newly elected city councils are
fighting party cadres for control of newspapers and
buildings. Radicals and conservatives throughout the nation
are at loggerheads over ousting party offices from factories,
farms, the KGB and the military.
   "This is a very difficult period, full of contradictions,"
says Lev Voznesensky, a senior government official. Because
of the lack of a clear divide between the role of party and
state bodies, "there is already a vacuum of power and it will
be terrible if it isn't filled quickly."
   A look at two key areas of decision-making, economic
policy and foreign policy, shows why the Communist Party
hardliners are seeing red -- and why Mr. Gorbachev still
can't free himself from the party. Party influence has
undoubtedly diminished. But the state power structures
supposed to take over its functions aren't complete. As a
result, the system of government has become murky at a time
when clear, tough decisions are needed more than ever.
   For years, major questions of economic policy were the
party's prerogative. Once its leaders made a decision, the
word was passed down through several departments of the
Central Committee that oversaw whole branches of the economy,
from machine-building to agriculture. Party officials in
every factory and farm and the party-run media then launched
propaganda campaigns to bring the message to the workers.
   Mr. Gorbachev, seeking to improve economic efficiency, set
out to change this command system. But taking the party out
of economic management has been a slow process. Although he
quickly closed the Central Committee's economic departments,
party influence lingers on.
   When the Soviet leader introduced detailed plans for
perestroika, or economic restructuring, in June 1987, he did
so in the traditional way, at a Central Committee plenary
meeting. When the Soviet parliament recently passed a law on
ownership that permits some private property, it first needed
formal approval from party ideologues. Economists say local
party bureaucrats continue to boss farmers around.
   But a decisive moment came this spring, after parliament
elected Mr. Gorbachev as president of the U.S.S.R. Using his
most radical language to date, he announced his intention to
turn the Soviet Union into a "market economy."
   For the first time, the party wasn't consulted, even
though switching to a market economy is an ideological
bombshell. Instead, bureaucrats and economists around Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov submitted plans to the Presidential
Council, a newly created body of advisers hand-picked by Mr.
Gorbachev.
   The council's reception was cool. "Most of the people were
against the program," says Oleg Bogomolov one of several
leading economists invited to participate at the session. "It
didn't represent a serious attempt to create a market. Its
main point was to curb demand."
   The government reworked its plans and presented them again
to the Presidential Council. This time, no independent
economists were invited, and the program was approved. But
all hell broke loose when Mr. Ryzhkov unveiled it in
parliament. The program included steep price rises for bread
and other basic goods, sparking panic-buying. Parliament
rejected the proposals and, after heavy lobbying by Mr.
Ryzhkov's aides to limit the political damage, ordered the
government to come up with a new version.
   Party officials are still seething, and their hostility
may have contributed to the public's outraged reaction to the
program. Some party people, notably Mr. Ligachev, openly
question the need for a market economy. But even those who
support the idea say many of the government's problems could
have been avoided if the party had been involved.
   "I'm not sure that if we had discussed it in the Central
Committee we would have come up with anything better," says
one senior party official deeply critical of the program's
details. "But maybe it would have prevented them from making
such deep political mistakes."
   Even some liberal economists believe it was a mistake to
bypass the party. "There was a need to explain the reform to
people," says economist Otto Latsis, deputy editor of the
party's theoretical journal, Kommunist. "Only the party is in
a position to do that. So far, it is the only consolidating
force in society."
   In foreign policy, an area where Mr. Gorbachev has made
the biggest changes, public disputes have been fewer. But the
decision-making process at times has become convoluted as the
functions of party and government officials have blurred.
   It used to be simple. Only a handful of people in the top
party leadership made the decision in 1979 to send Soviet
troops into Afghanistan. Although the Defense and Foreign
Affairs ministries were consulted on this and other key
decisions, their input was marginal and any objections were
overridden or ignored, officials say.
   Under Mr. Gorbachev's foreign minister, Eduard
Shevardnadze, the foreign policy process has changed beyond
recognition. Mr. Shevardnadze has turned his ministry from a
body that implemented orders into one that formulates policy.
Meanwhile, the Central Committee's international department
is now stripped of much of its staff and most functions. "The
atmosphere there is one of imperial decline," jokes Andrei
Kortunov, an analyst at Moscow's U.S.A. and Canada Institute,
who says his friends in the international department now
spend their time writing articles and traveling abroad.
   Still, the Central Committee department retains some
influence, particularly since Alexander Yakovlev, a Gorbachev
confidant, was placed in charge of it in 1988. Mr. Yakovlev
and Mr. Shevardnadze see eye to eye on most important issues.
Together with Mr. Gorbachev, the three men were instrumental
in deciding not to intervene in the anti-Communist
revolutions in Eastern Europe last year.
   But at a lower level, there are times when coordination is
difficult, and party bureaucrats still play important roles.
   Arms control is one such area. According to officials
involved in the process, Soviet positions are thrashed out at
interagency meetings attended by experts from the Foreign
Ministry, the Defense Ministry, the KGB, representatives of
military industry and Central Committee staffers. These
meetings are chaired by Lev Zaikov, a Politburo member who is
far less liberal than Mr. Shevardnadze.
   The result is occasional policy zigzags. This year, Mr.
Shevardnadze appeared to make major concessions to the U.S.
on limiting strategic nuclear weapons. But to the surprise of
the West, Moscow's position then quickly hardened. Foreign
Ministry officials say the change of heart resulted from a
reassessment of the Soviet position at meetings chaired by
Mr. Zaikov.
   But in some areas the party has completely given ground,
allowing the ministry a free hand. In the past, ambassadors
to East European nations were party people picked by the
Central Committee. This year, the Foreign Ministry replaced
many of the old guard with professional diplomats. But,
taking into account the spirit of democracy, it first
submitted its list for approval to the Soviet parliament's
foreign affairs committee.
   "It was a ridiculous procedure," says Mr. Kortunov of the
U.S.A. and Canada Insitute, who advises the parliament
committee and attended the session. "There was no vote, no
cross questioning. It was just a formal chat."

   Thirty-three years ago, the Soviet Union shook the West by
launching the world's first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit.
The event jarred Americans and galvanized the country's
resolve: Intent on not falling further behind the Russians,
the U.S. made science education a national mission and
pre-eminence in space a national goal.
   Today, some of the country's best minds think the U.S.
needs a new, similar spur to action -- but this time on the
economic front. For too long, they contend, the U.S. has
ignored critical problems that quietly threaten to undercut
its position as a world economic power. Now, some of them
say, the challenge from Japan may prove the Sputnik of the
1990s. "It's a kind of slow-motion Sputnik," says James
Powell, president of Reed College in Oregon. "It's there
beeping at you every time you turn on your VCR or load your
camera or turn on your fax machine."
   Already, a new wave of economic nationalism is spreading
across the U.S. It can be heard among the Nobel-prize winning
scientists at MIT and the cattle ranchers of Nebraska.
Americans worry that they are now locked into some inevitable
process of decline -- much like the economic downdraft that
has pulled at Britain for years.
   "You have to ask yourselves the same questions Brits asked
in the '60s," says Alan Bell, a British analyst at Baring
Securities in Tokyo. "As a Brit, you would get up in the
morning and brush your teeth with Colgate and use Palmolive
soap. You would drive a Ford to work for IBM and have Mars
bars for your snack during the day." Substitute Sony Walkmen,
Sanyo television sets and Toyota cars, and the story assumes
a disturbing relevance for the U.S.
   But as it demonstrated in the post-Sputnik era, the U.S.
has a unique talent for self-renewal. If harnessed by skilled
political leaders, the Japanese challenge could be used to
arouse a new sense of national purpose. Public opinion expert
Daniel Yankelovich even believes that a presidential
candidate with a clear analysis could make Japan and
competitiveness "the No. 1 issue in the 1992 campaign."
   What is to be done? What choices should business and
political leaders make?
   Not since World War II have the experts been so bitterly
divided. Some see Japan as an economic juggernaut, a "threat"
to be "contained." Others consider Japan as America's closest
ally and welcome the two countries' growing interdependence.
   Yet, amid the growing rancor, some common concerns about
U.S.-Japan relations have emerged. Japan is indeed a friend
and ally, but it also represents a challenge and perhaps even
a threat to the economic future of the U.S., given current
weaknesses in the American economy. Relations between the two
nations must remain close; but they will also be increasingly
troubled unless strong actions are taken on both sides of the
Pacific.
   Last week, the two nations reached an agreement aimed at
harmonizing their economic relationship. But, according to
the scores of interviews conducted for this series of
articles, much more will have to be done. Here are some of
the broad themes that promise to be at the core of future
debate.
                                                                                                       

   Economic nationalism can be a powerful tool to bring about
long-needed changes in the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   Many academics and some politicians deplore rising
economic nationalism, arguing that the world has become a
global village in which boundaries are less relevant. But
powerful feelings of American nationalism aren't about to go
away. If tapped, they can provide a source of the kind of
energy experts think is needed to match the Japanese economic
challenge.
   "If we decided, doggone it, we are sick to death of people
thinking the U.S. is in decline -- we could eat anybody's
lunch," says William Brock, a former labor secretary and U.S.
trade representative.
   There are dangers here, of course. If misused, economic
nationalism can lapse into ugly, even racist demagoguery in
which Japan becomes the "enemy." It can lead to "solutions"
that could in fact hurt both countries, such as measures to
block Japanese imports or restrict foreign investment. A
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll revealed this
potentially destructive side of economic nationalism.
Eighty-six percent of those polled said they would rather
have a policy of slower growth in both countries than a
policy of faster growth in both countries if that meant
allowing Japan to take the lead.
   The challenge for American political leaders is to harness
economic nationalism and channel it, so it can be used to
make the U.S. stronger, not Japan weaker.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. must save more and Japan less.
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese have more savings than they can productively
use in their own economy. Encouraged by government policies,
families set aside as much as 17% of their annual household
income. As a result, living standards in the country are
depressed and Japanese business has a wealth of money to
borrow and invest abroad. A lower savings rate in Japan could
spur living conditions there and potentially reduce
resentment abroad, where many economies are awash in Japanese
investment.
   Savings in the U.S. are another matter. For years,
Americans have been comparatively profligate, more inclined
to charge it than save it. Last year, Americans saved less
than 6% of their household income.
   As long as U.S. savings are low, investment from abroad --
notably Japan -- provides critical nourishment to the U.S.
economy, and any attempt to block it could cause substantial
damage. Nevertheless, America's dependence on foreign capital
is a potential problem for several reasons.
   First, anything from an earthquake in Tokyo to Japanese
dissatisfaction with U.S. policies could suddenly stop that
flow of cash, sending U.S. interest rates higher and possibly
touching off a recession. Second, the flow of interest,
dividends and profit earned by Japanese capital in the U.S.
is a drain on the living standards of future Americans. Many
people also worry that the one-way money flow will subtly
undermine the independence of the U.S.
   "I come from a small country -- Canada -- that's used to
foreign control," says Kenneth Courtis of DB Capital Markets.
"Foreign control basically means key strategic decisions are
made outside of your economy. The Belgians have learned to
live with that. I don't think you can live with it if you are
a superpower."
   Natural demographic trends will help correct the savings
imbalance in the future. American baby-boomers are only now
reaching their peak savings years, and the savings rate has
slowly started to rise. In addition, President Bush has
proposed a number of tax-related measures he says will
bolster savings, such as a tax-favored "family savings
account." In the meantime, a huge wave of Japanese will soon
reach retirement and begin to draw down their life savings.
   But economic studies suggest tax incentives provide only
modest encouragement to save, and the demographic trends by
themselves won't correct the remaining imbalance. For the
U.S., that leaves one way to raise the amount of savings
available for private investment: cut the federal budget
deficit, which is causing the government to borrow nearly
half the nation's paltry supply of savings.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. should encourage Japanese companies to act more
like other multinationals.
                                                                                                       

   Even if the savings imbalance were corrected, Japan's
multinational companies would continue spreading across the
globe, just as U.S. companies did in the 1950s and 1960s. But
unlike U.S. and European multinationals, Japanese companies
often don't hire locals for top management spots in their
overseas operations, nor do they give local suppliers the
same opportunities they accord suppliers back home.
   Until they do, Americans will rightfully view Japanese
investment as a mixed blessing. Moreover, business experts
say Japanese companies must dispel the notion that they are
agents of Japanese national policy -- that they are, for
instance, trying to keep the best jobs at home.
   John Stern, the American Electronics Association's vice
president in Tokyo, notes that European countries have used
hard-edged local-content legislation to "force Japanese
companies to behave like Europeans -- buy things on the local
market and promote local people." Yet that sort of effort can
be self-defeating, scaring away foreign investment and
promoting inefficiency. Still, the U.S. needs to find some
way to keep the pressure on Japanese business to conform to
world standards.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. must renew its commitment to manufacturing.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. is lagging in its ability to get science out of
the laboratories and onto the factory floor. To compete with
Japan, new efforts must be made to to turn technological
breakthroughs into products.
   For the most part, that's a task for the private sector.
American companies have spent much of the 1980s in a whirl of
financial restructuring. Many corporate consultants believe
that, in the 1990s, executives will spend more time on the
shop floor and less with their investment bankers.
   There are signs this is already happening. Spurred by
competition from Japan, U.S. manufacturing productivity has
improved substantially in recent years. And many companies
are paying new attention to the fundamentals of their
business. One group of American companies has helped MIT set
up a new program called Leaders in Manufacturing. It unites
two divergent academic disciplines -- engineering and
business -- and is working with 11 major U.S. corporations to
train a corps of future corporate executives.
   "What we've got to do," explains Bill Hansen, vice
president for manufacturing at Digital Equipment Corp., "is
get our fair share of the best and the brightest going into
manufacturing corporations and the disciplines of
manufacturing."
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. education system is in need of an overhaul.
                                                                                                       

   From the vantage point of his campus, Mr. Powell of Reed
College is worried. The average Japanese high school senior
scores as well as the top 5% of American high school seniors
in math and science, he says. "If we don't fix this problem,
there is simply no way we can be a first-class power in the
21st century."
   Mr. Powell believes the problem may be partly cultural.
"America has never valued education as much as we should," he
says. "We pay teachers little and we ask schools to do
everything -- be babysitters, provide vocational training,
provide counseling. Our leaders ought to get out of the tanks
and flag factories and into the schools."
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. must encourage Japan to make investment in that
country easier -- and American companies must work harder to
compete on Japan's turf.
                                                                                                       

   These days, Japan is the most demanding market for many
products. To reach world-class status American companies must
be able to compete there.
   Unfortunately, the easiest way to enter most foreign
markets -- acquiring a local company -- isn't easy in Japan.
Takeovers, by custom, are rare. And the stock of Japanese
companies is largely owned by other companies, creating an
interlocking network of business interests difficult for
foreign firms to penetrate. Changing that system won't be
easy. But the U.S. must encourage Japanese businesses and
government to find ways to allow foreign companies to get
into Japan's markets.
   In addition, American companies, on their own, must work
harder toward that goal. Companies with quality products and
aggressive marketing have proven it can be done.
   Motorola Inc., the Chicago-based maker of electronic
products, is an example. In the last 12 months alone, it has
recruited 150 Japanese employees, mostly engineers, by
cultivating college professors and handing out 500,000
"Motorola" textbook covers in college bookstores. It has
announced plans to open a second semiconductor factory in
Japan and it has sponsored twelve Chicago Symphony Orchestra
concerts throughout the country.
   "You have to use every tool in the book," says George
Fisher, Motorola's president and chief executive.
   In addition, in an effort to relearn the art of making
memory chips, a field the company had abandoned, Motorola has
entered into a cross-licensing agreement with Toshiba Inc.
"We're participating in the exporting of manufacturing
know-how back to the U.S.," says Rick Younts, president of
Nippon Motorola Ltd.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. government, too, should learn from Japan.
                                                                                                       

   Some people in the Bush administration virtually recoil at
the phrase "industrial policy." A powerful White House trio
-- Chief of Staff John Sununu, Budget Director Richard Darman
and Economic Adviser Michael Boskin -- have worked to boost
funding in basic research, but have quashed any effort to
promote any specific industry. Their fear is that government
efforts to encourage promising technologies could degenerate
into subsidies for companies with political clout.
   But in fact, the government already has an industrial
policy -- a hodgepodge of subsidies and tax breaks that have
provided an enormous boost to such industries as aerospace,
medical care and housing. What's needed now is for the
government to help American industry address a critical
business problem: making the leap from basic research to
commercial products. The U.S. needs to find new ways to
encourage investment in products for the future, even if that
investment doesn't produce short-term profits for companies.
                                                                                                       

   Americans must learn more about Japan as a country and
culture.
                                                                                                       

   Michael Armacost, the U.S. ambassador in Tokyo, notes that
Japan sends 25,000 students a year to the U.S., while the
U.S. sends only 1,000 to Japan. Chalmers Johnson, a Japan
specialist at the University of California, contends: "We
need infinitely more people who can read Japanese."
   Thomas Rohlen, who heads up the Stanford Japan Center in
Kyoto, is helping Americans learn about Japan. His program,
which educates American engineers, businessmen and others, is
run out of a gleaming building with its own Zen rock garden.
He recently scored a small victory when two of his charges,
both undergraduates, used Japanese to secure a small contract
to export American products to Japan.
   The Japan Science and Technology Program at MIT is also
helping change the trend. It sent 43 post-graduate engineers
and scientists to Japan last year for stints in Japanese
laboratories. "We're putting Japan into the bloodstream of
the best and brightest career scientists," says Richard
Samuels, the program's director.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. must forge a new partnership with Japan in
foreign policy.
                                                                                                       

   Secretary of State James Baker calls it a new "global
partnership" with Japan. But so far, the "partnership"
strikes many Japanese as one-sided. They see the U.S.
devising its own policies, then asking Japan to pay for them.
One example: when the U.S. developed a Third World debt plan
and then asked the Japanese to cough up several billion
dollars to help foot the bill. Given their growing power and
national pride, the Japanese aren't likely to accept such an
arrangement for long.
   "Adjustments are needed on both sides," says Takakazu
Kuriyama, Japan's vice minister of foreign affairs. "The U.S.
has to adjust itself to a new position in the world where you
are no longer the dominant power, but still the leading power
among industrial democracies. And Japan has to learn to
adjust itself to a new status as a major industrialized
nation."
   Thirty years ago this summer, the U.S. and Japan revised
the security treaty that has been the linchpin of their
relationship ever since. The revision was meant to put the
two on a more equal footing, but in the world of 1960 there
was no question that the U.S. was overwhelmingly the world's
economic power.
   Today the two countries are on a more nearly equal
economic footing. No matter how successfully the U.S. deals
with its economic problems, it is unlikely to regain the
position it held for much of the 45 years since World War II.
At the same time, the superpower tensions that helped shape
the U.S.-Japan partnership are easing.
   The world order will have to change to reflect these new
realities. What will that world order look like?
   Over dinner at a French restaurant in Tokyo, Takashi and
Kuniko Inoguchi hold forth on that question. The married
couple are among Japan's political science elite. He is 46
years old and a political scientist at Tokyo University; she
is 37, a professor at Sophia University and a popular
television commentator. He has his doctorate from MIT, she
from Yale, and both belong to Japan's small but growing group
of internationalists.
   They foresee four possible paths for the U.S. and Japan.
   The first is a revival of American dominance, "Pax
Americana," which they consider unlikely. The second they
call "Pax Nipponica," which would have Japan becoming the
leader of the free world. That's equally unlikely, concludes
Mrs. Inoguchi. "What makes a hegemonic power? You have to
have legitimacy," she says. "On this point Japan is very
weak. We have the debt of history."
   The third option they call "bigemony" -- the U.S. and
Japan sharing power. But that, too, has problems. "It
wouldn't be acceptable to Europe or Asia," says Mrs.
Inoguchi.
   That leaves the fourth option -- Pax Consortia, a world no
longer run by a dominant power, but by a coalition of leading
powers. "It is very difficult to manage," says Mr. Inoguchi,
shaking his head.
   But his wife is unequivocal: "It's the only possible
alternative."
   The world of the future will require the cooperation of a
number of major economic powers. The U.S. and Japan, as the
two largest single economies in that coalition, will hold the
key to its success.

   There is an inherent lack of understanding between the two

   Economy -- Tracking the Economy:
   Amid Uncertainties About the 2nd Half,
   Focus Is On Purchasers' and Jobs Data

   NEW YORK -- An uncertain second half begins with eyes on
the June purchasing managers' index, which is expected to be
a tad weaker, and the employment report, which may be a bit
stronger.
   The purchasers' index, to be released today, is expected
to weigh in around 50.5%, according to MMS International, a
unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. The index, which was 50.7% in May,
has been hovering above the 50% benchmark for two months, and
is considered a significant gauge of manufacturing activity.
A reading above 50% generally indicates a growing
manufacturing sector, while a reading below 50% indicates a
slowdown.

   The broader jobs report, scheduled for release Friday, is
expected to be plumped a bit by several seasonal factors.
   The week's other indicators include May factory orders,
June auto sales, and May consumer credit.
   "Starting the second half, the economy looks weaker than
it did when we came into the year," Allen Sinai, chief
economist of Boston Co., said. "The sluggishness has spread
into more sectors." He noted that retail trade and finance
softened considerably in the first half.
   On the brighter side, Mr. Sinai noted that exports "are
holding up quite well," while the manufacturing sector has
lately shown signs of a pickup. But Mr. Sinai and others
warned that the factory activity may be related to an
anticipated auto workers' strike and building for inventory
that may or may not sell. So "The revival in manufacturing
may turn out to be a false alarm," Mr. Sinai said.
   The auto makers' June activity is expected to help keep
the purchasing managers' index above the benchmark 50% and
help stem slippage in manufacturing employment. The consensus
view expects June factory payrolls to lose 10,000 jobs,
compared with a loss of 35,000 positions in May. More
worrisome to economists is the slowdown in the growth of jobs
in the service sector -- the main engine of recent economic
growth.
   Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Corp.,
Pittsburgh, expects service-jobs growth of about 150,000 --
on the high end of expectations, but still weak in comparison
with last year. In 1989, the average monthly increase in
service jobs was about 200,000 positions.
   As the June reporting period covers five weeks and
includes the bulk of student hiring, Mr. Hoffman noted that
any weaker-than-expected numbers would be even more
significant. "The {June} bias is toward overstatement, so any
weakness would be understated," he said. "I'd worry if, over
a three-month period, we found {service} jobs averaging less
than 100,000 a month. That would be very weak."
   The unemployment rate is expected to inch ahead to 5.4%
from 5.3% in May, according to the consensus.
   Samuel Kahan, economist at Fuji Securities Inc., Chicago,
said that estimating the number of service sector jobs is
difficult, at best, because "a good chunk of the figure is
really highly estimated." Nonetheless, the job count is worth
watching, he said. "We're finally seeing some deceleration in
employment growth. That should translate, over the next six
months or so, to a downward move on prides and wages," Mr.
Kahan said. The consensus view on average hourly earnings in
June calls for a 0.3% increase, down a bit from May's 0.4%
increase.
   May construction spending, to be posted today, is expected
to drop by about 1.2 percentage points, following declines of
0.7% each in March and April. And May factory orders,
scheduled for release tomorrow are expected to bounce back
from April's 2.3% decline with an increase of 2.1%, according
to consensus figures. The rebound is traceable to the
recently reported 3.9% increase in May durable goods orders.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   GOP Theorist Phillips's Book Inspires Democrats,
   But Republicans Call It `Garbage,' Him a `Fraud'

   WASHINGTON -- The Democrats believe they may have found
the thinker who can plot their way out of the political
wilderness. He's the Republican theorist who helped evict
them from the White House more than two decades ago.
   Kevin Phillips, generally credited with coming up with
Richard Nixon's "emerging Republican majority" in 1968, is
being quoted by Democrats all over town and denounced by
Republicans as a "fraud" whose new book is "garbage."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Phillips, an owlish Republican political analyst, is
developing a cult following among Democrats, who believe his
critique of Reaganism and Republicanism may help them regain
control of the White House. "Kevin," says Democratic party
chairman Ronald Brown, "has crystallized a lot of things."
   Mr. Phillips calls the Republican 1980s a decade of
excesses and binges. He accuses the GOP of becoming the party
of greed. And he blames Ronald Reagan and George Bush for
"the new political economics, intensifying inequality and
pain for the poor, the unprecedented growth of upper-bracket
wealth, the surprisingly related growth of the federal debt."
   In a city whose cultural life seldom reaches beyond
newspaper clippings and television sound bites, Mr.
Phillips's "The Politics of Rich and Poor" (Random House, 263
pages., $19.95) is the rare book that roils the capital's
waters. Rep. David Obey, a leading Democratic voice on
economic issues, was so anguished when he left his copy on
his desk that he called his office and asked an aide to run
it over to him at National Airport so he could finish it on a
trip back to his Wisconsin district.
   "This is not the Brookings Institution or Harvard saying
these things," observes Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana,
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
"It's coming from within the Republican Party."
   The Phillips thesis is that in the Reagan years the rich
became richer; the income of the top 1% of Americans rose to
more than 11% of the nation's total income in 1988 from 9% in
1980. Meanwhile, large chunks of the nation's population were
on a slide of "downward mobility." The result, he says, is
more economic losers than winners, with a large number of
Americans "facing deteriorating personal or family incomes or
a vague but troubling sense of harder times ahead."
   Mr. Phillips argues that the Reagan era represents the
third of what he calls "Republican heydays of wealth
concentration." He says that after the first two, the Gilded
Age that ran from the mid-1870s through the early 1890s and
the Republican ascendancy of the 1920s, came an economic
downturn and a populist reaction. He raises the question of
whether the U.S. is on the verge of a third burst of populism
and reform.
   Mr. Phillips, whose book made the capital-area best-seller
list of the Washington Post only a week after it became
available, isn't discomfited by the praise it has received
from his erstwhile rivals. He believes his effort might be
worthwhile if the GOP "pays a lot more attention to the
average guy again."
   For all their exultation over Mr. Phillips's argument,
some Democrats are troubled that this critique should emerge
from Mr. Phillips's word processor. "It is the sign of many
of the problems we have," says Democratic pollster Harrison
Hickman, "that it takes a Republican analyst to make our own
case."
   Even so, many Democrats are pleased to have that case
aired in such a deliciously ironic fashion and to have new
attention on the contrast between what Mr. Phillips calls
"proliferating billionaires and the tens of millions who were
gradually sinking" in the 1980s.
   "It's the kind of book you'd expect to be written by a
Democrat," Mr. Obey says.
   That's precisely what a lot of Republicans are saying.
   "I refuse to read that fraud's book," says John Buckley, a
Republican political consultant. "The man is a liberal
Democrat corporatist who despises entrepreneurship, Reaganism
and conservatism. Anyone who can deliver cornpone Marxism in
a Locust Valley lockjaw and get called a conservative is
pulling a swindle off on someone."
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia believes
that Mr. Phillips, in focusing on the success of the wealthy
in the Reagan years, is suffering from a kind of political
astigmatism.
   "Phillips is saying that people will be offended by a
party that allows a few big trees in the forest but also
protects your right to plant your own tree as an
entrepreneur," Mr. Gingrich says. "We're arguing that people
are more turned off by a party which promises to cut down the
biggest trees in the forest but to overregulate and overtax
you so you won't be able to plant your own tree."
   Democrats who tread deeply into the pages of Mr.
Phillips's book will find little comfort, however. He argues
that Democratic leaders are responding to the GOP much as
their party forebears did to earlier Republican heydays:
"cowed, conformist and often supportive of the prevailing
entrepreneurial, free-market mood."
   But such Democrats as House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri say that Mr. Phillips "understands what
the last 10 years have meant to working people." Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake believes that the Phillips book and the
contretemps that it has stirred may highlight what she calls
"fundamental fault lines in the Republican coalition." She
adds: "It's a whistle in Democratic ears, if only we'll
listen."
   The bookish Mr. Phillips is an unlikely protagonist in the
first passionate ideological debate of the summer. A
49-year-old graduate of Colgate University and Harvard Law
School, Mr. Phillips was an adviser to Richard Nixon's 1968
presidential campaign. For the past two decades he has
published a political newsletter and now also publishes a
biweekly on business and public-affairs issues. He gives
speeches to corporate groups and provides political analysis
on television public-affairs shows. (He is also a member of
this newspaper's panel of political experts.)
   In recent years, however, he has strayed widely from the
prevailing winds within the Republican Party, though always
clinging to the conservative label.
   "I don't remember once at Heritage when Kevin Phillips's
ideas have come up as something significant," says Stuart
Butler, director of domestic policy for the conservative
think tank that buttressed much of the policy underpinning of
the Reagan revolution. "He just doesn't figure in deep
discussions about where the conservative movement is going."
   White House aides curtly dismiss Mr. Phillips's book,
which carries only two promotional blurbs, one from Mr. Nixon
and the other from Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.
But leading conservatives are enraged by it. Rep. Steve
Gunderson (R., Wis.) argues that Republicans "are broadening
our base much more than the Democrats are doing." Eddie Mahe,
a Republican political consultant, calls the book "garbage"
and adds: "Maybe he calculated that the best way to sell a
lot of books is to make a lot of outrageous statements."
   Mr. Phillips is taking the criticism with equanimity. "I
was involved enough in the beginning of this Republican era

think much of some of the dynamics of the 1980s."

   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A dissident shareholder group in
Lionel Corp., expressing frustration with the toy retailer's
management, said it had begun to consider steps it might take
in an effort to boost the value of the company.
   The group, led by Trendex Capital Management, previously
has sought to press Lionel to find a buyer. The Trendex
group, which holds 5% of Lionel, said it amended its filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect its
wish to get greater accountability from Lionel executives and
an increase in the company's share value. It cited repeated
efforts by "Trendex. . . .other shareholders and the news
media" to get answers about the company's low market value,
"business practices and poor results," all to no avail.

   Lionel officials couldn't be reached for comment on
Friday.
   Earlier this year, Lionel rejected investor Robert I.
Toussie's offer of $8 a share, or $95.4 million. Since then,
the stock has gradually declined; it closed Friday at $2.75,
up 37.5 cents, in trading on the American Stock Exchange.
   Recently, the company reported a wider fiscal
first-quarter loss of $6 million, or 44 cents a share,
although sales were up 7.5% to $65.9 million. The company
cited reduced sales at existing stores and the expenses
involved in opening new stores.

   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. filed a $100 million lawsuit
against Pathe Communications Corp., charging "willful, wanton
and malicious" breach of contract in the collapse of Time
Warner's agreement to bankroll half of Pathe's proposed $1.3
billion merger with MGM/UA Communications Co.
   The lawsuit, filed late Friday in California state court
in Los Angeles, provides new details of how Pathe's financing
fell apart and seems likely to cast new doubts on whether the
Los Angeles-based company can go through with the MGM/UA
deal. Time Warner's presence was widely considered to be the
most credible piece of Pathe's bid. But Pathe last week
declared an "impasse" in trying to persuade Time Warner to
ease restrictions on how much debt Pathe could take on and
said it would seek other sources of money.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Pathe spokesman said the company's lawyers hadn't
reviewed the suit and declined to comment. In Culver City,
Calif., MGM/UA officials, who aren't included in the
complaint, couldn't be reached for comment.
   The suit also may raise new questions about the
credibility of Pathe Chairman Giancarlo Parretti. It charges
that he signed an exclusive video-distribution deal with the
Warner Bros. studio only eight days after his company signed
a similar, supposedly exclusive deal with MGM/UA; and that,
after promising Warner exclusive theatrical rights to as many
as 40 Pathe films over the next five years, he deleted
Warner's name from the draft agreement and used the same form
to sign the same deal with MGM/UA.
   But Time Warner officials, eager to get distribution
rights to MGM/UA's coveted United Artists film library in
exchange for guaranteeing or putting up $650 million in Pathe
financing, apparently ignored the alleged double-dealings
even after discovering them.
   When Warner Bros. executives signed the video deal on
March 14, they expressly asked Mr. Parretti whether video
rights had been sold to anyone else, according to a person
involved in the Warner side of the dealings. Mr. Parretti
reportedly said no, even though Pathe had signed with MGM/UA
on March 6.
   Nor did Time Warner back out of the financing role it
agreed to on April 9 even after learning that the
distribution rights to the United Artists film vault -- lined
with the lucrative likes of James Bond and the Pink Panther
-- had been signed back over to MGM/UA as part of a revised
merger plan unveiled on June 21.
   The United Artists library was by far the most attractive
element for Time Warner, which is convinced that the control
of such entertainment "software" as movies, TV shows and
videocassettes is crucial to prevailing in the global
entertainment business. Rivals Paramount Communications Inc.
and MCA Inc.'s Universal studio are also said to have sought
the United Artists rights, after Pathe on March 6 first
offered to buy MGM/UA for an initial price of $1.2 billion.
   Warner studio officials didn't take action then, the
person close to Warner explains, because Pathe assured them
that the distribution conflict would be taken care of once
MGM/UA had been fully acquired. Time Warner finally filed
suit only after Pathe announced the impasse over debt
restrictions and when it appeared likely that, even if Mr.
Parretti defies the odds and finds enough funding to complete
the MGM/UA merger, Time Warner won't be part of it.
   Details in the lawsuit also make it clear that, even if
the Pathe-MGM/UA deal ultimately fails, one real winner will
emerge: MGM/UA Chairman and controlling shareholder Kirk
Kerkorian. His company would keep a non-refundable deposit of
$200 million in cash that Pathe has put down toward the
acquisition, and the distribution rights to the new Pathe
films, as well as old United Artists movies; plus another $75
million in film revenue from two pending Pathe pictures,
promised as collateral in the acquisition.
   Some of those provisions were imposed by MGM/UA when
Pathe, which has had trouble raising money to complete the
bid, revised the terms of its offer in June. The new pact
increased the original $20-a-share bid to $21.50 a share --
in essence paying Mr. Kerkorian and other MGM/UA shareholders
interest because of repeated delays in closing the deal.
Shareholders would receive $4 a share in cash by July 20,
drawn from the $200 million that Pathe already put up, and
would get the remaining $17.50 a share by Oct. 23.
   Indeed, now that MGM/UA can lay claim to the assets most
attractive to a prospective backer -- the United Artists
library and Pathe's future films -- it may be more difficult
for Pathe to line up a new partner.
   In New York composite trading Friday, MGM/UA closed at
$17.25, down 62.5 cents; Pathe, at $3.25, down 50 cents, and
Time Warner, at $100.50, down $1.875.
   The paths of Pathe and Warner Bros. first crossed in June
1989, when they began negotiating for Warner to distribute
Pathe films to U.S. theaters. By February 1990, the lawsuit
states, the two companies had reached an agreement, and
Warner had begun plotting media spending for three new Pathe
films, dickering over a publicity campaign with Tom Selleck,
the star of one of the films, "Quigley Down Under."
   The simple distribution deal turned into a complex -- and
high-risk-bankrolling agreement when Pathe made its bid for
MGM/UA a month later. Time Warner agreed, in essence, to
advance Pathe $650 million against future royalties, keeping
65% of the money taken in by Pathe films and passing the
other 35% to the combined Pathe-MGM/UA, as well as grabbing
the rights to some 1,000 United Artists movies.
   But Time Warner set a major condition for its $650 million
gamble: Pathe must come up with another $600 million by
selling equity rather than by taking on more debt. Some $450
million had to come from Pathe itself, and Mr. Parretti had
assured Time Warner that Pathe subsidiaries would provide the
cash. The other $150 million had to come from an outsider,
and officials in both companies looked to Mr. Kerkorian as
the likely source.
   But Time Warner later found that Pathe's Comfinance unit
in Europe had taken on debt to provide cash for the MGM/UA
deal. Some of the financing was extremely short-term -- such
as a $75 million loan that a Parretti travel subsidiary had
made, to be repaid in only seven days. And Mr. Kerkorian --
who rarely talks to the press -- so far has offered only $20
million rather than the hoped-for $150 million, a
Warner-related person says.
   Pathe tried to persuade Time Warner to lower the amount of
equity that the bidder would have to raise. But Time Warner
resisted, fearing that a debt-riddled Pathe/MGM would
collapse. That seems an unusual concern given Time Warner's
own sizable debt load of $10.6 billion. But the company
generates cash flow of $2.4 billion a year, while Pathe is
thinly capitalized and MGM/UA has been dormant in the film
business for much of the past year.

   RTC Sold 155 S&amp;Ls in Second Quarter,
   But U.S. Budget Suffered From the Sales

   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. sold 155 failed
savings and loan associations in the second quarter,
exceeding the agency's target, but the RTC blew a hole in the
federal budget to do it.
   The swift sales of the thrifts, which held nearly $50
billion in assets, were a big morale boost for the S&amp;L
bailout agency, which began from scratch 10 months ago. It
sold just 55 thrifts during the first seven months of the S&amp;L
cleanup.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the $45 billion in cash required by the RTC for the
sales in the latest quarter helped spur the budget
negotiations between the White House and Congress, and were a
factor in President Bush's conceding that a tax increase is
necessary to reduce the budget deficit.
   The RTC will run out of cash some time after October, the
agency said, and unless the budget summit clears the way for
more funding, the agency will have to delay further sales of
insolvent thrifts. A Treasury official last week said the
Bush administration is depending on the budget negotiators to
devise a funding plan. "Beyond that, we have no Plan B," he
said.
   The transactions Friday included the sale of CenTrust
Savings Bank, Miami, a thrift made famous by the excesses of
its chairman, David Paul. CenTrust was acquired by Great
Western Financial Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif., in a
transaction requiring a record $1.7 billion of assistance. In
addition, units of Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles,
purchased Gibraltar Savings of Simi Valley, Calif., and the
Washington state offices of Gibraltar Savings, Seattle.
   The RTC estimates it will save nearly $200 million this
year in operating and funding costs related to the
institutions it sold this past quarter. "This accomplishment
puts us on schedule and allows the RTC to move forward with
our original operating plan of completing 50 to 75
resolutions a quarter," said RTC Chairman William Seidman.
   The S&amp;L industry's losses result from the bad investments
that institutions made, using federally insured deposits. In
the deals so far, the RTC estimates that it transferred or
sold about half of those assets to buyers. But many of those
transactions include terms that allow the buyers to return
the assets to the government if the buyer finds fraud or
underwriting problems.
   The industrywide cleanup, including interest, will cost
upward of $300 billion over 10 years. Including Friday's
flurry of deals, the RTC has completed transactions covering
207 failed thrifts. A spokesman for the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. estimated the losses of those transactions at
$26 billion, based on preliminary data.
   The transactions Friday included:
                                                                                                       

   -- Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan Association, a Simi Valley
thrift with $6.7 billion in assets, was sold to Security
Pacific National Bank, Los Angeles. Security Pacific will
assume all deposits and some secured liabilities, totaling
$5.5 billion, and agreed to purchase $5.3 billion of the
failed thrift's assets. The RTC estimates the transaction
will ultimately cost the government $521.6 million.
   -- Security Pacific Bank Washington bought the Washington
offices of Gibraltar Savings, Seattle. Gibraltar's Florida
branches were purchased by Great Western Bank, a unit of
Great Western Financial. The acquirers will assume deposits
totaling $1.2 billion. The RTC's ultimate cost was put at
$106.1 million.
   -- First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Colorado
Springs, Colo., with $281.9 million in assets, was acquired
by Western National Bank of Colorado Springs, in a
transaction expected to cost the RTC $138 million.
   -- Elysian Federal Savings Bank, Hoboken, N.J., with
$114.3 million in assets, was sold to Pamrapo Savings Bank,
Bayonne, N.J., in a deal expected to cost the RTC $33.5
million.
   -- Valley Federal Savings Association, McAllen, Texas,
with $536 million in assets, was sold to International Bank
of Commerce, Laredo, Texas, in a transaction expected to cost
the RTC $210 million.
   -- The RTC placed Windsor Federal Savings Association,
Austin, Texas, into receivership. Windsor Savings had about
$121.6 million in assets.
   Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. permitted
South Boston Savings Bank, Boston, to assume the deposits of
Eliot Savings Bank, Boston, with $450 million in assets. The
FDIC will advance $363 million to South Boston to the buyer
for the transaction.

   Once Genteel, Japan Debate
   Is Getting More Rancorous

   In the old days, debates between experts on Japan were
genteel, scholarly affairs. But as divisions between the
experts have grown, so too have bitterness and rancor.
   Last year, for example, Karel van Wolferen and Edwin
Reischauer met to tape a show on Japan at a Cambridge, Mass.,
radio station. Mr. van Wolferen, a Dutch journalist and
author of a book critical of Japan's political system,
believes the U.S. should be warier of the country. Mr.
Reischauer, a former ambassador to Japan, advocates a strong
friendship between the two nations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The show, however, was never aired; it degenerated into a
shouting match.
   "The guy got so violent," says Mr. Reischauer.
   Counters Mr. van Wolferen: "I was very polite to him all
the time. I told him, `It's clear I know more about political
developments in Japan than you do. Why don't you just
listen?'"

   TORONTO -- Robert Campeau and National Bank of Canada were
silent this weekend about whether Mr. Campeau had made a
first payment of 40 million Canadian dollars (US$34.2
million) to retrieve his Campeau Corp. securities seized by
the bank.
   Mr. Campeau, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Toronto real estate and retailing company, had until midnight
Saturday to come up with the money. National Bank, based in
Montreal, seized the securities in January after Mr. Campeau
defaulted on personal loans amounting to C$153 million. Mr.
Campeau previously faced a deadline of May 31 to make a first
payment, but that deadline was extended.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new deadline fell as Campeau Corp. reported a widening
loss for its first quarter ended April 30.
   After National Bank's seizure of securities, Mr. Campeau's
fully diluted stake in Campeau Corp. fell to about 21% from
43%. The securities included 13 million Campeau Corp. common
shares, C$60.4 million of convertible debentures and four
million convertible preference shares.
   Under Mr. Campeau's agreement with National Bank, he was
to pay a further C$40 million by Jan. 31, 1992, or, failing
that, pledge the C$60.4 million of debentures back to the
bank. National Bank agreed to vote the securities seized
according to Mr. Campeau's direction.
   Separately, Campeau Corp. said that Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp., a Youngstown, Ohio, developer, agreed to extend to
July 20 an agreement not to call its US$480 million loan
without first giving nine days' notice. The agreement, which
has been extended several times, was due to expire Saturday.
A similar agreement with the Reichmann family's Olympia &amp;
York Developments Ltd. doesn't have an expiry date.
   Campeau Corp. defaulted in January on the DeBartolo loan
and on US$225 million remaining in a loan from Olympia &amp; York
when its U.S. retailing units, Federated Department Stores
Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection. In March, Campeau Corp. refused to pay interest
due on the loans.
   Campeau Corp. itself hasn't filed for bankruptcy or
liquidation in Canada, but it has said it plans to seek
approval at the July 30 annual meeting to dispose of a
"substantial portion" of its Canadian real estate assets to
reduce debt.
   For its first quarter, Campeau Corp. reported a loss of
US$80 million, or $1.87 a share. A year earlier, it had a
loss of $67 million, or $1.65 a share. Revenue rose slightly
to $2.26 billion from $2.23 billion.
   The latest period's result included a $47 million gain
from the sale of assets, compared with a gain of $98 million
a year earlier. The company also had a $21 million charge in
the most recent period related to Chapter 11 reorganization
costs. There wasn't a similar charge a year earlier.
   Operating profit declined to $185 million from $213
million. Operating profit, defined as earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and costs related
to Chapter 11 reorganization, is considered the most accurate
measure of a business under Chapter 11.

   Big Steelmakers
   To Post Lower
   2nd-Period Net
   ---
   Prices and Orders Trailed
   Firm Year-Earlier Pace;
   Special Problems Cited

   Major steelmakers, while rebounding from a lackluster
first quarter, will post lower second-quarter earnings as
prices and orders failed to match last year's robust levels.
   Analysts said average profits for each ton of steel
shipped in the second quarter will range from $20 to $25 a
ton, up from about $15 in the first quarter but down from $50
in last year's second quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The average second-quarter profits are somewhat skewed
because of special problems at various steelmakers, including
maintenance-related outages, one-time charges and start-up
costs of new plants. Excluding those special items, according
to John Tumazos, a steel analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette, major producers would have earned about $30 per ton
of steel shipped.
   In the second quarter, relieved steelmakers began seeing
steadily improving volume and pricing.
   The pricing erosion that began in the second half of 1989
appears to have halted, as modest price increases were
announced and implemented on most key plate and sheet
products. Still, selling prices, while improved from the
first quarter, are about $20 a ton lower than a year ago,
says Mr. Tumazos.
   And while prices are beginning to rise, so are labor, raw
material and energy costs. All steelmakers, except industry
leader USX Corp., have negotiated higher-cost labor contracts
within the past year. USX, whose contract with the United
Steelworkers expires in January 1991, will begin negotiations
in the second half.
   Most steelmakers also began to see orders pick up at the
end of the first quarter, as car makers began boosting
production. J. Clarence Morrison, a metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, noted that booming orders
continued through the second quarter and became more
broad-based, extending to smaller buyers serving the energy,
agriculture and equipment-making industries.
   Still, those positive factors weren't enough to offset
problems at some major steelmakers.
   Hardest hit was Armco Inc., which expects to post a
second-quarter loss. The company recently announced that it
would take a $70 million charge in the quarter for a jury
award against it, a federal tax assessment and ongoing
toubles at its insurance and financial companies, which are
in liquidation.
   But even without the charges, analysts said Armco would
post an operating loss of about 10 cents to 15 cents a share,
compared with last year's profits of $75.6 million, or 84
cents, including a $45 million loss from discontinued
operations. Armco has had trouble with its Brazilian
operations, and lost carbon-steel orders in the quarter
because of prolonged labor talks.
   Meanwhile, earnings at Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation's
No. 2 steelmaker, were squeezed by the close-down of its
blast furnace at Sparrows Point, Md., for repairs. Analysts
expect Bethlehem to earn between $10 and $15 a ton in the
second quarter, compared to $13 a ton in the first quarter.
Per share earnings are estimated at about 25 cents a share,
down from $1.03 a year ago.
   Inland Steel Industries Inc. experienced start-up costs
for its I/N Tek joint venture with Nippon Steel, but should
be able to earn about $25 to $30 a ton, compared to last
year's $56 a ton, analysts said.
   USX will likely lead its competitors in profits per ton,
in part because the company didn't have any unusual items.
The No. 1 steelmaker is expected to earn between $30 and $32
a ton, compared to $53 a ton last year, and $23 a ton in the
first quarter, according to Charles Bradford, an independent
steel analyst.
   Some analysts say the third quarter may be the industry's
best of the year. By then, steelmakers should more fully
benefit from major price increases slated for shipments
beginning July 1. And auto-related orders could pick up even
more in anticipation of a possible strike against the auto
makers, which begin contract negotiations in September.
   The big wild card is imports, which were surprisingly low
in the first half. But a soft world economy, especially in
countries like Brazil, and falling spot prices in Europe may
lead foreign steelmakers to increasingly seek sales in the
U.S. "There's a risk of rising foreign deliveries in second
half," said Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
   And those increased imports could be chasing after fewer
orders.
   Prudential's Mr. Morrison notes that the industry is
heading into a seasonal low. "Can this high level of order
pattern that we've seen lately be sustained?" he asked. The
answer, he said, may be in the performance of the durable
goods market.

   East Germans Celebrate Currency Union
   As Country Is Reunified in All but Name

   EAST BERLIN -- The West German mark replaced East
Germany's flimsy currency yesterday, and Rolf Bittighoefer
said he still had to pinch himself to fathom it all.
   Sipping a $4 glass of champagne at one of East Berlin's
best hotels to celebrate, Mr. Bittighoefer recalled his years
as a border guard in the late 1970s, with orders to shoot on
sight anybody trying to flee to the West. A West German guard
on the other side of a fortified fence once patted his pistol
and said he had a special bullet reserved for him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'm glad I wound up with his money instead," Mr.
Bittighoefer said. After finishing his champagne, he said, he
would return to the drugstore he opened last month and stock
his shelves with merchandise he bought on credit from West
German distributors. For the first time, his customers will
have to pay in West German marks. "Will it work?" he asked.
"It has to work."
   Monetary union -- or "Day X," as it is known here -- took
months to prepare. Billions of West German marks had to be
brought over to furnish East Germany's 16 million people with
their new currency, a high-cost and risky operation that is
about to jolt East Germany's economy to the core.
   For all practical purposes, Germany reunified over the
weekend. Having lost its currency and surrendered control
over its finances and social-security system, East Germany
ceased to exist as a sovereign state. "People know that as of
Monday, the music plays in Bonn," observed a senior West
German Foreign Ministry official. "That is where the budget
decisions will be made, and all other important decisions."
   In a nationally televised address last night, West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised that wealthy West Germany
will do everything it can to help ease East Germany back on
its feet, but that the process won't be easy for all. "The
citizens of the Federal Republic and the DDR are now
irrevocably linked," he said. "We have waited for this for 40
years."
   Although many West Germans grumble about the cost of
unity, the arrival of the West German mark and rescue
programs didn't come a moment too soon for East Germany's
rapidly deteriorating economy. East Germany's former system
of central planning has disappeared as quickly as the
Communist regime that controlled it for four decades.
   Many East German officials are adjusting quickly. Edgar
Most, former vice president of the Staatsbank, East Germany's
monolithic central bank, shrugged as he explained his own
whirlwind transition from Communist administrator to
arch-capitalist after signing on as board member of Deutsche
Bank AG's fast-growing joint venture in East Germany. "There
were no longer any other alternatives," said the 50-year-old
Mr. Most. "Our first task was to survive."
   Yet, at least for a day, fears of economic crisis and mass
unemployment faded as East Germans celebrated in scenes
reminiscent of the night the Berlin Wall was opened in
November.
   On Saturday night, 10,000 people counted down the minutes
to monetary union in East Berlin's huge Alexanderplatz
square. At midnight cheers went up and the midnight sky
filled with fireworks as groups of revelers popped champagne
corks. Many of them sang the West German national anthem and
chanted "Germany, United Fatherland."
   At one point, a milling crowd of several hundred was
waiting outside an Alexanderplatz savings bank in the
mistaken belief they could begin drawing their West German
marks there after midnight. A megaphone crackled from the
fringe of the crowd. "Attention] Attention] This is the
People's Police," a voice boomed, to jeers and whistles. But
the crowd fell silent when it went on : "If you want your
money, go across the street to the Deutsche Bank." In an
instant the throng wheeled and surged toward the new Deutsche
Bank branch across the square, joining the crush of several
hundred already waiting to get in.
   Rainer Grossimlinghaus, the manager of Deutsche Bank's new
Spittel market branch in East Berlin, couldn't sleep Saturday
night. He arrived at the bank at 6:30 a.m. Sunday to find a
queue of people 60 yards long waiting patiently outside for
the door to open.
   "We were very busy for a while, but all went very
smoothly," he said. Most came merely to make a quick currency
exchange, but about a dozen paused long enough to open the
branch's first accounts.
   Working behind the counter was Regina Buthut, a former
Staatsbank employee who underwent four month of intensive
retraining in Western retail banking at one of Deutsche
Bank's West Berlin branches.
   "It's really like the hour zero," she said. "Everybody is
staring reality in the face."

   Quarterly Review of Underwriting:
   Merrill Stays in No. 1 Spot; Goldman Second

   NEW YORK -- Despite a shrinking market share, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. clung to the top of the global underwriting heap
in the first half as U.S. financing volume rebounded.
   Merrill's strengths in the corporate debt, convertible
debt and asset-backed securities markets helped propel it to
the top underwriting spot, a position it has held since early
1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the nation's largest securities firm was hurt by a
drop in its share of stock underwritings. It helped
underwrite 9.4% of all common stock issues, down from 13.9% a
year earlier, halving its total underwriting market-share
lead over Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
   "We should be a bigger factor" in equity issues, said
Jerome Kenney, president and chief executive officer of
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. "But we're getting involved
earlier on, trying to determine which companies over the next
three years will consider {issuing} equity," he said.
   Overall, the volume of stock and bond offerings in the
U.S. in the first half rose 13% to $163 billion. The rise was
triggered by a surge in new issues of mortgage and
asset-backed securities, which accounted for about 55% of all
money raised in the U.S.
   But a slump in Eurobonds and international equities led to
a 6% decline in the volume of global stock and bond issues to
$252.6 billion, according to Securities Data Co. Merrill,
with an 11.4% share of the global marketplace, continued its
top ranking; second-place Goldman's market share stood at
9.5%.
   Rising interest rates and the collapse of junk bonds sent
the U.S. corporate debt market into the skids. Corporations
issued just $54.1 billion of new bonds in the first half,
down 26% from a year earlier and the smallest amount of money
raised in this sector since the second half of 1985.
Investors apparently craved quality: triple-A, double-A and
single-A-rated bonds accounted for more than 70% of this
market's volume, Securities Data said.
   For the first half, Merrill underwrote $26.3 billion of
domestic stock and bond issues, for a 16.1% market share,
according to Securities Data. Goldman, with its continued
dominance in equity underwriting, was close on Merrill's
heels, helping to raise $21.2 billion, for a 13% market
share. First Boston Corp., a unit of CS First Boston Inc.,
and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. each hold a 10.8% slice of the
market.
   Because of a pullback by financial institutions in issuing
new stocks and bonds, Merrill and Goldman turned to
industrial issuers for about one-fifth of their financings.
In 1989's first half, financial firms, including commercial
banks and savings and loans, accounted for more than 25% of
Merrill's underwriting business; now that figure stands at
8%.
   Merrill raised $13.6 billion in corporate debt issues, for
a 25.1% market share. Morgan Stanley was No. 2, by helping to
raise $12.5 billion.
   Some securities executives expect the corporate debt
market to rebound in the second half. They point to a large
supply of debt maturing in the next six months set at very
high rates that have to be refunded.
   "We're looking for a very sizable volume of
{corporate-debt} business for the Street in the second half,"
said Roger Vasey, senior vice president of Merrill's global
debt markets division.
   Issuers of mortgage and asset-backed bonds found a more
receptive audience. This sector posted record first-half
volume, raising $89.8 billion, a 59% jump from 1989's first
half, Securities Data said.
   One reason mortgage-bond underwriting has increased is
that investors skittish about taking big risks felt more
comfortable turning to these higher-quality bonds, securities
executives say. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., a unit of Bear Stearns
Cos., led all securities firms in mortgage-bond underwriting.
   And issuers looking to get assets such as credit-card
receivables off their books hit it big. The volume of
asset-backed bonds more than doubled in the first half to
$19.2 billion. In the past two weeks alone, nearly $5 billion
of asset-backed bonds have been brought to market. For the
half, First Boston led all other firms, helping to raise $5
billion.
   Stock issues sizzled. Boosted by near-record stock prices,
stock underwriting volume surged by 45% to $12.9 billion.
Reflecting the stock market's renewed strength, the number of
common stock offerings for the first half totaled 308, a 67%
jump from a year earlier. Goldman Sachs led in the stock
category, helping to raise $2.5 billion for a 19.1% market
share.
   Issuers of initial public stock offerings didn't fare as
well. New offerings raised $7 billion, up from a moribund $6
billion a year ago. But IPOs on average outperformed the
market averages in the first half, gaining 14.5%, an
indication of momentum to come, Securities Data said.
   Alex. Brown &amp; Sons won top IPO honors, helping to raise
$1.5 billion.
   Meanwhile, underwriting volume abroad continued to slump.
Turbulence in the Japanese stock market overshadowed
improving prospects in Europe, triggering a 28% drop in
Eurobond and international stock volume to $89.6 billion.
Eurobonds are debt securities sold by issuers outside their
home markets.
   But Eurobonds denominated in European currency units
soared to a record $11.4 billion, an increase of more than $5
billion from a year earlier. Look for ECU-denominated
Eurobonds to play an increasingly bigger role in
international underwriting as Europe's 1992 economic unity
nears, industry executives say.

   June Farm Prices Fell 1.3% From May
   Due to Hog, Wheat and Soybean Declines

   WASHINGTON -- Farm prices in June dropped 1.3% from May,
largely as a result of weakening hog, wheat and soybean
prices, the Agriculture Department said.
   Although hog prices slipped $1 in June to $60.20 per
hundred pounds, they were still $15.10 higher than a year
ago, the department said. What's more, a June 1 survey of the
nation's inventory of hogs and pigs indicates that hog
producers can count on strong prices continuing into the
fall. Because of an unusually tight hog supply, meatpackers
could bid up prices even higher in coming weeks, according to
some analysts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For consumers, that portends continued high prices for
bacon and other pork products at stores. Glenn Grimes, a
University of Missouri agricultural economist, said he
expects retail pork prices to be 13% higher in August than a
year earlier.
   Cattlemen received an average beef cattle price of $74.20
per hundred pounds in June, down 20 cents from the previous
month but still $6.60 above the June 1989 average price,
according to the department's price report. Steers and
heifers also dropped 20 cents to $78.10 per hundred pounds,
while cow prices rose 30 cents to $53.80 per hundred pounds.
   Wheat prices averaged $3.15 a bushel, down 25 cents from
May, while rice averaged $7.03 per hundred pounds, down 18
cents. Corn prices averaged $2.69 a bushel, up seven cents
from May, while sorghum grain prices averaged $4.19 per
hundred pounds, up 15 cents. Soybean prices dropped 21 cents
in June to $5.75 a bushel.
   Fruit prices, led by plunging orange prices, fell 4.9%
from May, according to the department.
   In the hog markets, barrows and gilts averaged $61.10 per
hundred pounds and sows averaged $51 in June.
   The department estimated the national inventory of hogs
and pigs at 54.4 million on June 1, down 3% from a year ago
and from June 1, 1988.
   The breeding inventory totaled an estimated 7.2 million,
down 2% from last year and down 5% from two years ago,
according to the department's quarterly survey. The market
hog inventory was estimated at 47.2 million, down 3% from a
year ago and from June 1, 1988. Mr. Grimes said that if the
market hog inventory has been overestimated, as he suspects,
it will mean smaller hog marketings and stronger prices.
   The department said the nation's pig crop between December
1989 and May 1990 totaled 45.2 million, down 4% from the same
period a year ago and down 4% from two years ago.
   Hog producers intend to have 5.82 million sows farrow
between June and November, a 1% increase from the number of
sows farrowing during that period in 1989 but 4% fewer than
two years ago.
   In a separate report on spring planting, the department
said there has been significant expansion in acreage for
several crops from last year. Cotton acreage jumped 17% to
12.4 million acres, and rice acreage rose 5% to 2.7 million
acres, as Sun Belt farmers took advantage of relaxed
government limits on planting.
   Peanut growers, in the meantime, planted the largest
amount of acreage in 33 years -- 1.73 million acres, up 4%
from 1989 -- while tobacco farmers planted 725,000 acres, up
7%. Sugar beet growers increased their plantings by 6% to 1.4
million acres, according to the department. Much of the
expansion was in southern Minnesota and the Red River Valley
along the Minnesota-North Dakota border.

   Gypsy Moths Beset Residents
   Of Pennsylvania Town;
   They Beset One Another

   INDIANA TOWNSHIP, Pa. -- People who are antsy about bugs
shouldn't read this story, and definitely shouldn't visit
Peggy Uminski right now. Because when Mrs. Uminski is asked
if that sound outside is rain, she replies: Oh no, that's
just the sound of thousands of caterpillars munching on
everything around the house and then excreting millions of
peppercorn-sized pellets.
   Gypsy moth season has arrived here in its grossest form.
In their current state, the insects are hairy caterpillars,
swarming over houses and devouring majestic oaks. They're
everywhere, from toilets to patio furniture, turning areas
all around Pittsburgh into an Indiana Jones nightmare. "It's
really like a grade B horror movie," says Launa Haney Post,
looking up at trees where two-inch caterpillars hang like
fuzzy black tinsel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And an uncivil war has broken out in small towns like
Murrysville over what to do about it. Sharon Malhotra
received angry phone calls at night. "Zealot]" "Fanatic]" Her
crime: She and her Citizens for Responsible Pest Management
are lobbying against the use of chemical pesticides, fearful
of the health effects. The callers, convinced that the moths
are a bigger threat than the spray, want to blast the insects
into chemical oblivion.
   "It gets to be a real donnybrook," says James Pierce,
staff scientist of Environmental Action, a Washington, D.C.,
organization that assists local opposition to chemical
pesticides. In one of Virginia's finest neighborhoods, he
recalls, the issue became so emotional that neighbors got
into fistfights, bullied each other's children and threatened
to kill each other's pets.
   There is no question that the gypsy moth is a pest, and
has been since 1869, when a French bug fancier, trying to
breed a better silk caterpillar in the U.S., brought some
over from Europe. Unfortunately, he forgot to close his
window and some escaped, causing moth mayhem in his hometown
of Medford, Mass. By the following year, caterpillars were so
thick in Medford that passers-by couldn't tell the color of
houses.
   Since then, the moths have spread south and west. They
arrived in Pennsylvania decades ago, first honeymooning in
the Poconos before pouncing on Pittsburgh, this year's hot
spot. They're expected to linger a few more years before
their feeding frenzy moves them southwest.
   To fight back, towns in the Pittsburgh area appointed
Gypsy Moth Coordinators, who help track and destroy the
caterpillars. Residents call gypsy moth hotlines and read
gyspy moth newsletters. In some schools, sixth graders have
raised moths for science class and written journals on the
life and death of caterpillars with names like Mitsy, Betsy
and Tootsie.
   There's even a gypsy moth song published by the American
Forestry Association -- the "Inch Along Song." Some of the
lyrics: "Worms we are, a moth we'll be, fat, happy and free.
In-ching a-long, inching a-long, in-ching a-long, just you
and me."
   Even the most ardent nature lovers are repulsed. "I hate
them," says Gary Stokum, manager of the Washington County
Conservation District. The moths' only redeeming quality is
that they die quickly. The caterpillars hatch in the spring
from eggs laid by last year's moths. Then they enter the pupa
stage -- tiny, beef-jerky-like things -- and emerge as moths
in July. In this last leg of life, female moths, who
fortunately are too fat to fly anywhere, lay quarter-sized
egg masses, each with about 500 eggs. The moths die by the
end of summer.
   The caterpillars are 24-hour eating machines. They trample
blindly over each other as they scale trees, lampposts and
barns in search of their Holy Grail -- the oak leaf. Once the
oaks are stripped, they'll eat anything green short of
Astroturf.
   They hide everywhere, trespassing No Trespassing signs,
cruising in old tires and lounging on patio furniture. They
hold people like Mrs. Uminski hostages in their own homes. On
Father's Day, the ravenous rampage was just too repulsive for
the Uminskis and their dinner guests. The menu was changed
from barbequed chicken to Shake 'n Bake and the party was
moved inside.
   She and her neighbors have become Raid-bearing Rambos.
They stab and crush the moths, using fly swatters, penknives,
machetes and ice picks, before drowning them in jugs of
bleach.
   Ms. Uminski says her four-year-old daughter used to panic
when she saw caterpillars. "Now she just stomps on them like
everyone else." The desperate haul out propane torches to
crisp the critters, unfortunately sometimes toasting trees as
well. And while most try to save valuable trees, the truly
vanquished cut them all down.
   "It's as much a financial and social problem as a
biological one," says Environmental Action's Mr. Pierce. It's
also a political can of worms. Here in Indiana Township, flag
burning doesn't hold a candle to gypsy moths as the No. 1
issue. Some residents are mobilizing against township
supervisors for refusing to participate in a state-sponsored
spray program because of liability concerns.
   "We want to vote them out," says Janet Giel, who found
caterpillars crawling on her closet and floating in her
toilet.
   Fred Rimmel of the Audubon Society refused any spray for
the society's 136-acre Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve in
Allegheny County, even though it could mean the loss of some
200-year-old oak trees. Some oak-loving, moth-hating society
members quit paying dues. Nearby residents blasted him in
letters to local newspapers for sentencing the mighty oaks to
death.
   Mr. Rimmel argues that the bacteria spray may affect other
caterpillars, which are food for young birds. Still, people
look at him disparagingly, he says, as a "right-to-lifer for
moths."
   The debate was neatly set in letters to the editor of a
small newspaper called the Ligonier Echo. Eric Oesterling, a
Westmoreland County agricultural agent, argued that the
chemical pesticide Dimilin, which is the most effective in
highly infested gypsy moth areas, is "one of the safest and
least toxic insecticides man has ever known. . . . By
comparison, it is less acutely toxic than either table salt
or aspirin."
   In response, two local doctors, Dale Fruman and N.K.
Malhotra, wrote that being "one of the least toxic
insecticides" is like being a little pregnant. The doctors
expressed concern about the long-term effects of all toxic
chemicals and noted that once Dimilin is broken down, one of
its byproducts has produced cancer in laboratory animals.
   "Mr. Oesterling may be willing to have his eggs with
Dimilin," they wrote. "We still put table salt on ours."
   Allegheny County officials initially planned to spray
100,000 acres this year. But only about 25,000 acres got
juiced, due partly to citizens' chemical angst, says Michael
Blumenthal, the state's forest pest management specialist.
"People get upset and worry about their kids and their health
when you say `spray,'" he says.
   Professional hit men have sprung up. One mothbuster, Mark
Ticehurst, formerly of the state's forest bureau, founded the
National Gypsy Moth Management Group Inc. of Landisburg, Pa.
"Gypsy moths are our bag," he says.
   The private consulting group of professional entomologists
and biologists has monitored and sprayed the moth population
in the well-heeled suburb of Fox Chapel, collecting $230,000.
The company also releases parasitic wasps and gnats to help
kill Fox Chapel's moths, provides education materials and
conducts town meetings.
   A federally funded program in Morgantown, W.Va., called
the Appalachian Integrated Pest Management Demonstration
Project, is trying to check the mating habits of gypsy moths.
In one project, the scent females use to lure male moths is
artificially reproduced and released into the environment.
The idea is to lead the male on a wild moth chase until he
dies.
   Scientists have also used the $7 million federal grant to
try to figure out a way to develop a sterile male moth to
compete with virile moths for the female.
   Erik Mollenhauer, a New Jersey education consultant, is
flitting across the country trying to sell his Just Say No to
gypsy moths campaign to teachers. He has a packet that
includes an inch-thick planning guide, a 9-minute videotape
and a gypsy moth board game that looks like a cross between
Monopoly and gypsy moth Trivial Pursuit, with questions like
"What is the nickname of the ground beetle that feeds on
gypsy moths?" (Answer: Caterpillar hunters.)
   Mr. Mollenhauer envisions children and parents together
embarking on search and destroy missions. As he says, "It's a
lot more effective than a picture in a post office saying
`Have you seen this bug?'"

   The Outlook:
   Strength in Exports
   May Not Be Timely

   WASHINGTON -- The House Ways and Means Committee recently
held a retreat on the subject of the Uruguay Round, the
latest multination effort to push the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade farther toward free and open world
commerce. C. Fred Bergsten, who moderated the session, said
the congressmen were skeptical about GATT. They thought
"Super 301," the system the U.S. uses to punish nations that
don't perform in world trade as the U.S. thinks they should,
is just great. Some of them seem to think a Super Duper 301
might be even better.
   Current trade statistics may have added to the feeling
that no new trade rules are needed. The Commerce Department
late last month raised its estimate of the first-quarter
gross national product because of a sharp upward adjustment
of exports. Exports slipped slightly in April, but imports
fell even more. So when Mr. Bergsten last week moderated
another conference, this one at his Institute for
International Economics, there was pessimism about the
chances of replacing America's unilateral trade policy with
an expanded multilateral approach.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week Mr. Bergsten, in an understatement, told an
audience of academics, businessmen and government officials
that there was "some doubt" about the success of the Uruguay
Round. The talks are not scheduled to end until next
December, he noted, and international negotiations in the
past have always had aspects reminiscent of "The Perils of
Pauline" -- with victory finally being snatched from the jaws
of defeat. "But this time," he said, "we may be in more
trouble than usual."
                                                                                                       

   Carla Hills, the U.S. Trade Representative, told the
conference that President Bush at next week's Houston
economic summit will say that a successful Uruguay Round is
his most important economic objective. "It is beyond my
comprehension," she said, "that with so much at stake we
would not make the Uruguay Round work."
                                                                                                       

   It would be ironic to see the talks break down at a time
when, outside the negotiations, there seems to be momentum
toward free trade. The U.S. and Canada, after arguing about
their trade relations for more than a century, finally
concluded a free trade agreement. Mexico is talking about a
similar pact with the U.S. Brazil, long a strong
protectionist, last week announced it would lower tariffs and
ease import restrictions. Also last week, Mr. Bush proposed a
free-trade zone for the entire Western Hemisphere. The
nations of Eastern Europe, meanwhile, are hoping that
something like GATT will help them move toward economic
parity with the West.
   While failure of the round would be ironic, it is clearly
possible. A major U.S. goal in the current round is reform of
agricultural trade. The GATT nations have tried for reform
several times before, usually getting almost nowhere. "This
time," Dale-Hathaway, a consultant, said, "the talks seem to
be right on track." If there is a difference between the
current round and its predecessors, it could be that the
disagreements have increased.
   "Pressure at the economic summit won't help," Mr. Hathaway
said. "World leaders don't burden themselves with
agricultural problems."
                                                                                                       

   In the past the agricultural arguments have been "settled"
by postponing any difficult decisions to the next
multilateral meeting. But many of the developing countries
have a lot of agricultural goods they could sell if trade
restraints were reduced, and their support is needed if any
progress is to be made in several other areas. So failure in
agriculture could have broader effects.
                                                                                                       

   The current GATT round, for instance, is looking seriously
at services for the first time. The U.S., which is highly
efficient in services, wants the agreement to guarantee the
right to establish a business in a foreign country for the
purpose of providing a service. Several of the developing
countries would exclude any such provision. Brian Hindley of
the London School of Economics, who discussed the service
negotiations, said: "In a way, I'm an optimist. Unless the
whole round unravels, I think there will be an agreement on
trade in services. But the content of that agreement is far
from clear."
   Intellectual property is another area where the U.S. and
other industrial countries need support from the developing
world. The developed countries, as major exporters of
technology, want protection of trademarks, copyrights and
patents. Many developing countries, even if they agree with
protection in principle, lack either the will or the strength
to enforce it. The developing countries are hungry for
technology and tend to be leery of any rules that impede its
inflow.
                                                                                                       

   The issues are incredibly complex.
   One speaker last week argued that the time had come for a
thorough overhaul of the GATT organization. A major reason
for the U.S. move to unilateral settlement of trade disputes,
after all, is frustration with lengthy and uncertain GATT
dispute-settlement procedures.
                                                                                                       

   Meanwhile, many congressmen figure the U.S. is doing fine
with the status quo. How can the free traders convert
Congress? Henry R. Nau, a George Washington University
professor, suggests that the negotiators can do it by
bringing in a successful Uruguay Round agreement. Anyone who
listened to the talks last week knows that's a tough job.

   The head of the Trump Shuttle has stepped down, a move
reflecting the continuing turmoil at Donald Trump's
one-year-old airline.
   Bruce Nobles, president of the Shuttle, was replaced
Friday by Richard Cozzi, who has been the airline's vice
president of operations since its inception. Mr. Cozzi will
also be the chief operating officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Shuttle has lost almost $100 million since Mr. Trump
acquired it from Eastern Airlines for $365 million in June
last year. Although Trump officials and Mr. Nobles weren't
available for comment, Mr. Trump has previously expressed
disappointment that the Shuttle hasn't performed better. The
airline, which operates Boston-New York-Washington shuttle
flights, has increased its share of that market to 50%, but
Trump officials had hoped for 60% by now.
   Mr. Nobles's departure follows a series of other changes
at the Trump Shuttle. It recently canceled four daily round
trips in both the Boston-New York and Washington-New York
markets on Saturday, as well as two other flights in each
market Sunday. Also, it has laid off about 70 employees and
cut back a few frills, such as its concierge desk.
   Mr. Nobles was president of the Pan Am Shuttle before
joining the Trump airline. At Pan Am, Mr. Nobles helped to
end Eastern Airlines' dominance in the lucrative Boston-New
York-Washington shuttle flights. By the end of 1988, after
two years of operations, Pan Am had garnered 45% of the
travel on those routes, largely because of Mr. Nobles's
start-up efforts and Eastern's much publicized difficulties.

   HOLLYWOOD -- Even in this town of flamboyant spenders,
37-year-old movie producer Joel Silver stands out.
   At an estimated cost of $62 million, his "Die Hard 2: Die
Harder," an extravaganza that opens on Wednesday, has become
one of the most expensive films ever made. "At one point we
thought we were spending $1 million a day," says Joe Roth,
chairman of News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox, the movie's
backer. "It was like walking down the street and finding a
hole in your pocket."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Silver has made others in Hollywood feel the same way.
His free-spending ways, along with his temper tantrums and
coarse manner, have alienated studio executives and
secretaries alike. But the success of his highly commercial
action movies such as "Predator" and "Lethal Weapon" has
redeemed him in the eyes of others.
   Spy magazine labeled him a "taste-free bullyboy." Actor
Rick Moranis parodied him as a fast-talking hysteric in the
movie "Head Office." Mr. Silver even played himself, a
screaming movie maker, in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." But he
became the subject of gossip over the spending on "Die Hard
2," and Hollywood has been buzzing with stories of improper
use of studio funds.
   Mr. Silver declined to be interviewed. Through a
spokesman, he denies any wrongdoing. Fox itself insists that
a regular internal audit turned up no evidence of any
misappropriation of funds. Mr. Roth does say the studio has
increased its auditing staff as a result of the cost
overruns. The studio also took greater control of the set of
"Predator 2," produced by Mr. Silver and two other producers.
   "We are becoming more aggressive rather than reactive,"
says Mr. Roth. He adds: "Joel is an extravagant producer. He
is not irresponsible. He has a big appetite and a very wide
vision."
   He isn't the only one. A record year at the U.S. box
office and growing demand for American movies abroad have
loosened Hollywood's purse strings. Studios are spending
enormous sums on potential hits. Paramount Pictures' "Days of
Thunder" and Carolco's "Total Recall" each cost more than $50
million to produce.
   Mr. Silver's fans are quick to observe that, with various
partners, he has produced some of Hollywood's top-grossing
movies. With Richard Donner he made "Lethal Weapon 2," which
has grossed roughly $250 million. In February, the National
Association of Theater Owners named Mr. Silver producer of
the year, noting that revenues of films he helped produce had
topped $1 billion.
   Warner Brothers, which backed "Lethal Weapon" and its
sequel, also loves Mr. Silver. He recently signed a five-year
contract with the studio, which expects to back two or three
of his pictures a year. He commands one of Hollywood's
highest producer fees, $1 million a picture. He runs his
company, Silver Pictures, from a luxurious bungalow on the
Warner lot that once belonged to actress Marion Davies.
   Warner Brothers has even let Mr. Silver use one of its
jets to fly friends to his sprawling plantation in South
Carolina, where he is spending $2.5 million to renovate one
of the two Frank Lloyd Wright houses he owns. Actor Bruce
Willis, star of "Die Hard" and its sequel, and his wife, Demi
Moore, have been guests.
   "He is one of our most important producers," says Mark
Canton, an executive vice president of Warner Brothers, a
Time Warner division. "Joel Silver is as respected and
friendly with the cream of the crop of Hollywood as anyone I
know."
   But Mr. Silver's screaming matches have alienated senior
executives at several big studios, including Paramount and
Walt Disney Co. "Joel will let nothing stand in the way of
achieving his vision. You have to be prepared to battle him
along the way," says Leonard Goldberg, an independent
producer and a former head of Twentieth Century Fox who
worked with Mr. Silver on "Die Hard."
   Mr. Silver, son of a public-relations executive father and
a journalist mother, grew up in South Orange, N.J. An ardent
student of the old Hollywood, he attended New York University
film school. "Everyone else wanted to be a director,
cameraman or editor," recalls Jack Rapke, an agent at
Creative Artists Agency and a former classmate. "Joel had a
love affair with the Hollywood moguls. He aspired to be a
producer like David O. Selznick."
   He later took a job as an assistant to producer Larry
Gordon, a veteran maker of action movies. Friends say Mr.
Silver often served as Mr. Gordon's driver and seemed
desperate to succeed in the movie business; he coveted fine
clothes and possessions he couldn't yet afford. "He was
insanely hungry for money and power, but he didn't have
either, and that made him suffer," says Ken Finkleman, a
friend and the writer and director of "Head Office," the
movie that parodies Mr. Silver. "But his suffering was
endearing. He was funny and knew everything about Hollywood."
   Two of his attempts to leave Mr. Gordon and work within
other movie companies failed, partly because of his attitude
toward authority and spending. After he was hired as a
production executive at Universal Pictures in March of 1979,
he bought art deco furniture for his office and sent the
company a bill for more than $6,500. Insiders at the time say
top executives were stunned because he hadn't asked for
permission first. The company ordered him to pay the bill
himself.
   Mr. Silver also threw a birthday party for himself at
Michael's, a pricey restaurant in Santa Monica. He invited
about 40 guests, including Universal executives. He later
submitted an expense accounting for more than $10,000.
Insiders at the time say the company again told him to pay
up. They say he was fired after less than a year in January
of 1980. While there, he had supervised "Xanadu," one of
Universal's biggest bombs, an over-budget musical starring
Olivia Newton John.
   Mr. Silver had another brief tenure, at Polygram Pictures,
run at the time by producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters. He
was brought in by Mr. Guber as an executive vice president of
development and production in April of 1981. He left less
than two months later after repeated clashes with Mr. Peters.
"Sparks flew," recalls Gordon Stulberg, who was president of
the company at the time.
   There were other problems, including spending on the movie
"The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper," which Mr. Silver was asked to
help salvage. Frank Baur, vice president and executive
production manager at the time, says Mr. Silver asked him to
"conceal or delay the reporting on the spending." Mr. Baur
says he refused. He also recalls that Mr. Silver said, "No
{expletive} hairdresser is going to tell me what to do,"
referring to Mr. Peters' former occupation.
   Fred Altman, Mr. Silver's business manager, says Mr.
Baur's statement about concealing spending is "ludicrous." A
lawyer for Mr. Silver, Jake Bloom, says the producer left
both Universal Pictures and Polygram by "mutual consent." He
also says that when Mr. Silver moved to Polygram, that
company agreed to purchase his art deco furniture from
Universal, and when Mr. Silver left Polygram, he bought it
back as part of his settlement.
   Mr. Silver returned to Mr. Gordon and has worked with him
on and off ever since. Their first big hit was "48 Hours," an
action movie starring Eddie Murphy that grossed about $100
million. But Mr. Silver and Mr. Gordon have since had their
share of disappointments, such as "Streets of Fire," a big
money loser for Universal. Some of Mr. Silver's attempts to
produce movies on his own didn't fare particularly well at
the box office, such as "Road House" and "Weird Science."
   Mr. Gordon remains the senior partner, and his producer
credit comes first on Gordon-Silver films such as "Die Hard"
and its sequel. But it is Mr. Silver who usually spends long
hours on the set. Unlike many producers, he deeply involves
himself in every stage of a movie, from script development
through final editing. He has aggressively pursued stars such
as Arnold Schwarzenegger for his movies. "No one fights
harder to get a movie made," says Mr. Gordon.
   Some people think he fights too hard. His aggressiveness
has led him to bulldoze anything that stands in his way --
sometimes almost literally.
   Stalled by a line of cars at the Fox studio guard gate
during the filming of "Die Hard," he once ordered the driver
of his Mercedes-Benz to enter at the exit. An irate Fox
official ripped the identification decal off his car and
banned Mr. Silver from the lot. Mr. Goldberg finally decided
to ban only the car and driver. "It sounds like a childish
solution but I was anxious to get him back," says Mr.
Goldberg.
   People who stand in his way sometimes suffer his wrath. An
official of the Los Angeles airport once ordered Mr. Silver
to come up with a $100,000 deposit to continue filming
"Commando" after a spat over moving an X-ray machine. "He
told me how important he was, and he said he would have my
head," says Lang Moy, assistant to the chief of airport
operations. "I thought he had an ego problem. I guess he
feels very impressed with himself. He feels he can buy and
sell people."
   Mr. Silver's Rambo-style personality seems suited to the
action genre. For a scene in the original "Die Hard," he even
pressed to create a real explosion on a lower floor of Fox
Plaza, a major Los Angeles office building then owned by Fox.
"He promised he could get it cleaned up and the windows back
in over the weekend," says Craig Baumgarten, executive vice
president of production at Fox at the time. Fox overruled Mr.
Silver and the scene was filmed in miniature with scale
models.
   Fox itself is partly to blame for the cost of making "Die
Hard 2." Mr. Roth, who joined Fox last August, didn't decide
until October to rush the movie into production for summer
release. That gave the crew little time to prepare for the
big-scale airport thriller, which requires snow scenes. Mr.
Silver led the hapless crew of more than 200 from one city to
another in search of snow as weather forecasts failed them.
Mr. Roth received bills as high as $50,000 for dry ice and
$100,000 a day for the use of a Boeing 747.
   As the costs escalated, worried Fox executives looked for
ways to save money, and Mr. Silver kept fighting for scenes
he wanted. "I was getting phone calls at midnight," says
Roger Birnbaum, president of production at Fox. Mr. Silver,
he recalls, would typically say, "You're killing me] You're
killing me] I'm out here and I'm going to give you a $100
million movie. If you don't give me this, the movie will be a
flop. It will be on your shoulders]"
   During the filming, Mr. Silver helped to organize a
birthday party for Mr. Willis, the movie's star, at a bowling
alley in Studio City. Those on the invitation list, including
Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy, received bowling shirts
with their names embroidered above the pockets, by messenger.
The party cost about $10,000, which didn't come from the
movie's budget. It was paid for by Mr. Silver, Twentieth
Century Fox, Warner Brothers, Tri-Star Pictures and Triad
Artists, a talent management agency.
   Still, as the movie's cost kept climbing, Fox's largess
waned. Fox sent John Landau, a new senior executive vice
president of production, and Tom Jacobson, executive vice
president, to the sets of both "Die Hard 2" and "Predator 2"
to control costs. "As the picture became more difficult, we
asked to be involved in any decision that wasn't in the
budget," says Mr. Jacobson. "They were big money decisions."
   Insiders say Fox executives are now unlikely to pursue
three additional projects they have in development with Mr.
Silver. But "Ford Fairlane," another Fox movie produced by
Mr. Silver, is expected to be released this summer.
   While the cost of the movie may have dismayed Fox, Mr.
Silver's spending habits clearly please his crews. "The
difference between working for Joel and another producer is
the difference between flying baggage and first class," says
Nancy Hansen, a script supervisor. "His caterer serves
Chateaubriand steak that is so tender you can cut it with a
plastic fork."
   Mr. Silver, who collects pottery and Frank Lloyd
Wright-designed furniture, once told a gathering of studio
executives, "I'm not in this business to make art. I'm in
this business to make money to buy art." Six years ago he
paid about $726,000 for the Storer house, a concrete-block
home in the fashionable Hollywood Hills designed by Mr.
Wright in the 1920s. Its restoration has been chronicled in
House &amp; Garden.
   His greatest indulgence may be the Auldbrass Plantation on
more than 200 acres in South Carolina. As part of his $2.5
million renovation, he added a 135-foot swimming pool and a
tennis court. He is also rebuilding the stable, where he
keeps a white Arabian horse, a gift from singer Wayne Newton.
A cook prepares southern dishes such as alligator and key
lime pie for guests.
   His plans proved too grand for friends who bought the
house with him three years ago, and Mr. Silver bought them
out.
   A female associate suggests that Mr. Silver be nicknamed
"Citizen Silver" after the movie based on the life of William
Randolph Hearst, the publishing magnate who built the opulent
California castle called San Simeon. Mr. Silver's Auldbrass
Plantation, says Michael Levy, president of Silver Pictures,
"will be his San Simeon."

   Quarterly Review of Underwriting:
   Underwriting
   Fees in 1st Half
   At 5-Year Low

   NEW YORK -- When it comes to underwriting stocks and
bonds, more is less these days on Wall Street.
   Despite a rising volume of new issues, securities firms'
underwriting profits in the first half plunged to their
lowest level in five years. Fees that firms earned from
underwriting new securities so far this year amounted to a
paltry $1.2 billion, according to Securities Data Co. That's
down 17% from a year earlier -- even though the volume of new
issues actually rose 13% in the same period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The reason is that Wall Street firms are making less than
ever on each stock or bond issue they help bring to market.
The fee that securities firms raked in for each issue -- an
average of $399,000 -- is down 44% from a year earlier. In
1985, the last time total underwriting fees were so lean,
Wall Street firms made an average of $1.1 million an issue,
Securities Data says.
   "This is just a dramatic drop-off," says Francine Wissak,
a Securities Data analyst. The shrinking fees per issue
should throw cold water on "anyone who says they're doing
deals and making money and that things are coming back to
normal levels," Ms. Wissak says.
   The deepening slump in underwriting profits is likely to
lead Wall Street firms to cut staffs further and pay many of
the remaining employees less, some industry executives argue.
Even as underwriting fees slump to five-year lows, salaries
remain far above 1985 levels.
   "We've got to be more rational on compensation," says
Robert Downey, a partner at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and chairman
of the Securities Industry Association, a trade group. Wall
Streeters "can have damn good careers," Mr. Downey says, "but
they're not going to have instant gratification."
   The end of Wall Street's fat-fee era reflects the collapse
of the junk-bond market, once a big money maker for
investment banks. Just seven new junk-bond issues were
brought to market in this year's first half, with fees
totaling a mere $16.2 million. This is down from $462.4
million in fees for 69 issues a year earlier, Securities Data
says. Throughout the late 1980s, junk bond fees averaged $450
million every six months.
   Despite lower fees paid by issuers, some securities
executives maintain that underwriting profitability has
rebounded in other areas. They say that's partly because
firms are widening the underwriting "spread," or the
difference between the price a securities firm pays to buy an
issue of stock or bonds from the issuing company and the
slightly higher price the firm charges investors.
   "In the past, much of the spread has been given up to the
investor, and investment bankers haven't kept it," says Roger
Vasey, senior vice president of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s global
debt markets division. "Now the trend is in favor of
retaining a bigger percentage of the spread on deals,
although we're working harder for it."
   Still, there's currently nothing in Wall Street's hopper
to replace the once-lush revenue flowing from high-yield junk
bonds. For instance, the hottest area of the underwriting
landscape right now -- mortgage and asset-backed securities
-- generates razor-thin fees for securities firms, industry
executives say.
   One area that's making up ground is fees from underwriting
issues of common -- both initial public offerings and issues
by companies with stock outstanding. With the stock market
rising to near-record levels and many companies trying to
reduce debt levels by selling equity, fees earned from
underwriting stocks surged 35% to $709.3 million in the first
half, Securities Data says.
   Some analysts expect the stock resurgence to continue. "As
companies de-leverage going into the '90s, you should have
more issuance of stock to strengthen {the companies'} capital
structures," says James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim
Schroder &amp; Co.
   Goldman Sachs was swept up by the rising equity tide.
Goldman ranked No. 2 in total underwriting fees for stocks
and bonds for the six months, earning $171.7 million in fees,
nearly two-thirds of it from stock issues. Merrill Lynch,
with $172.6 million in fees, remained on top, underwriting 29
more stock or debt issues than Goldman.
   Initial public stock offerings, although not booming,
continued to rake in the fees. Securities firms' fees from
IPOs totaled $457 million, a 15% jump from $396 million in
the first half of 1989. Although IPOs account for 40% of all
underwriting fees, they're still far below the levels seen
just a few years back. In 1986's fourth quarter alone, IPOs
generated $541 million in fees for Wall Street, surpassing
this year's entire first-half level.
   Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc., helped by heavy IPO volume,
jumped to the No. 3 fee spot for total underwriting fees. The
Baltimore-based brokerage firm earned $114.3 million in fees
through 22 offerings -- a big jump from its $63.9 million and
its No. 9 ranking in last year's first half. Much of the
increase stems from a threefold jump in IPOs underwritten by
Alex. Brown.
   "The markets have been more receptive," says Richard
Franyo, an Alex. Brown managing director. "But you've got to
be a bit worried that as the markets get a little overcooked,
it could end."
   Salomon Brothers Inc. ranked No. 4, posting a 65% jump in
underwriting fees for the period. But First Boston Corp. and
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. lost ground. First Boston, which
has shied away from the junk market recently, made just $89.5
million in total underwriting fees, down 22% from a year
earlier. Shearson Lehman slipped to the No. 8 spot from No.
5, earning $78.6 million. Shearson was hurt in part by
uncertainty stemming from the firm's well-publicized
financial and management turmoil.
   Missing in action is Wall Street's fee leader for 1989's
first half. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. earned $260 million
from underwritings, with junk bonds accounting for 94% of its
fee total. Of course, Drexel is out of the picture now; its
parent company filed for bankruptcy-law protection in
February after a cash crunch caused by the collapse of the
junk-bond market.

   Great Western
   Acquires Remains
   Of Miami Bank

   It pays to be lucky in business, as James F. Montgomery
once more has been reminded.
   Mr. Montgomery is chairman and chief executive officer of
Great Western Financial Corp., which became the biggest
thrift in Florida's lending market with its acquisition of
the remains of Miami-based CenTrust Savings Bank from the
Resolution Trust Corp. Great Western, based in Beverly Hills,
Calif., paid about $86 million to pick up 71 branches and $5
billion of deposits formerly held by CenTrust. Mr. Montgomery
said Great Western intends to sell assets it also acquired in
the transaction, reducing its ultimate outlay to about $60
million. The government threw in $1.7 billion, tying CenTrust
with Western Savings Association, Phoenix, Ariz., for the
distinction of being the most expensive single thrift failure
to date.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Great Western's $60 million bill contrasts with the $150
million Mr. Montgomery agreed to pay for certain CenTrust
branches and deposits last year, before the extent of the rot
at CenTrust became clear. CenTrust, laid low by the
extravagant ways of its chairman, David L. Paul, was seized
by the government early this year, enabling Great Western to
scrap its previous accord and ultimately to save tens of
millions of dollars. That also raises the question of whether
regulators could have saved the taxpayers money by moving
more quickly to rein in CenTrust before the value of its
assets shriveled so much.
   "Some time has passed since our first agreement, and the
assets have deteriorated," noted Mr. Montgomery. "I can't
second guess the government. But sometimes things work out to
where you can pick up things a little cheaper."
   Great Western also on Friday acquired 18 Florida branches
of defunct Gibraltar Financial Corp.'s Gibraltar Savings Bank
from the RTC. The two transactions will give Great Western
150 Florida branches and particularly strenghten its presence
in Miami and Orlando, two of the country's more bristling
banking markets. Great Western also got a toehold on
Florida's prosperous West Coast, entering for the first time
Tampa and St. Petersburg.
   Mr. Montgomery said that about $2.1 billion of the $5
billion in CenTrust deposits acquired from the government are
retail deposits, with the remainder being more volatile
brokered deposits. On that basis, Great Western's purchase
price was roughly 3% of retail deposits, which is the middle
range of prices paid for large thrift branch systems bought
from the RTC.
   Brokered deposits are large sums of money placed by Wall
Street money managers, who move the deposits swiftly from
institution to institution in search of the highest interest
rates.
   Mr. Montgomery said he expects the brokered deposits to
leave the institution when Great Western trims the high rates
CenTrust had been paying to attract deposits. In all, Mr.
Montgomery said, the two transactions are expected to
eventually leave Great Western with about $6 billion in
Florida retail deposits.
   Great Western has $40 billion of assets and about 1,000
offices nationwide. The transactions were disclosed after the
market closed on Friday, when its stock closed at $18, off
12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

   Bohemia Inc. said it will permanently close its Culp Creek
plywood facility within two months, citing a timber shortage
expected to be compounded by the federal government's
decision to list the northern spotted owl as a threatened
species.
   The move will affect the jobs of 248 employees of the
Eugene, Ore.-based concern. Rising material costs --
resulting from loss of access to old growth forests -- and
sagging plywood prices were factors in the decision to close
the facility. The company said the situation is "expected to
worsen" because of the Bush administration's decision last
month on the spotted owl.

   The plant, also in Oregon, generated $20 million of the
company's $350 million revenues in fiscal 1990. Richard D.
Tinney, Bohemia's president and chief executive officer, said
the company will try to place as many employees as possible
in its other facilities.

   Prospect Group's Shareholders to Get
   Equity in Eight Firms From Liquidation

   NEW YORK -- Prospect Group Inc. shareholders will receive
equity in an odd potpourri of several businesses as part of
the company's pending liquidation.
   Altogether, Prospect shareholders will receive interests
in eight companies, ranging from a railroad-holding company
and a mushroom producer to a distributor of Swiss Army
Knives. But because some of the companies aren't public, the
exact value of the assortment isn't yet clear.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This was a difficult company to understand," a spokesman
declared, explaining in part why Prospect chose to break up
the unusual conglomerate. For some time, officials have
maintained that the stock market didn't recognize the
underlying value of Prospect's various assets.
   Because "several assets don't have a public market, their
value isn't readily apparent," said Michael Millman, analyst
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "Until the liquidation, the
shareholders didn't know how they would directly and
specifically benefit from the operations."
   Mr. Millman gives management high marks, however, for
building Prospect's group of businesses. "The negative of the
liquidation is that shareholders can't participate" any
longer with Prospect's investment managers, the analyst said.
   Prospect went public in May 1986 at $9.75 a share;
shareholders approved the liquidation plan Wednesday at the
annual meeting here. Of the 22 million shares eligible to
vote on the liquidation plan, 18 million voted and more than
90% of those approved the transaction. In national
over-the-counter trading Friday, its shares closed at
$17.625, down 12.5 cents.
   Terms of the liquidation require Prospect's managers to
distribute its assets within three years. If some assets
remain after that time, they will be placed in a trust and
distributed by the trustees.
   Earlier this year, Prospect holders received one share of
Illinois Central Corp. for each two Prospect shares, a total
of 62% of the Chicago freight-railroad holding company. A few
shares were held for stock-option programs for Prospect
executives who also held directorships at Illinois Central.
   The Illinois Central stock will trade in tandem with
Prospect's until the railroad's shares receive a separate
over-the-counter listing. Prospect's spokesman expects the
railroad's shares to begin trading separately in August or
September.
   In the liquidation, Prospect also will convert its small
preferred-stock holding of MidSouth Corp., a Jackson, Miss.,
freight railroad, to common stock, and holders will receive
those shares. In 1987, Prospect distributed its MidSouth
common shareholdings; the new allocation will give Prospect
holders substantially all MidSouth's common. In national
over-the-counter trading Friday, MidSouth shares fell 25
cents to $8.75.
   Prospect shareholders also will get stakes in:
   -- Sylvan Foods Holdings Inc. Prospect's holders will
receive one share of the Worthington, Pa., mushroom producer
for about each 10 of their shares. Prospect will seek an OTC
listing for Sylvan's shares.
   -- Children's Discovery Centers of America Inc. Prospect
holders will receive a 1-for-10 distribution, or a total of
50%, of the San Rafael, Calif., operator of childcare
centers. CDCA last traded over the counter Wednesday and was
quoted at $3 bid.
   -- Forschner Group Inc. Prospect holders will receive a
1-for-10 distribution, equal to a total of 58%, of the
exclusive U.S. distributor of the Swiss Army Knife. Based in
Shelton, Conn., Forschner trades national OTC; the shares
closed Friday at $11, down 25 cents.
   -- Ivy Insurance Group Inc. Prospect wholly owns this
Pasadena, Calif., auto-insurance company and is seeking to
sell it. Prospect, which bought it in July 1988 from Kemper
Corp. of Chicago, may have a problem selling this unit
because in November 1988, California's voters radically
tightened the laws regulating property/casualty insurers.
   Sometime in the future, Prospect will distribute holdings
in:
   -- Recognition Equipment Inc., a Dallas manufacturer of
document-processing equipment. Prospect holds 1,431,800
shares and a $15 million 10% senior subordinated note
convertible into 1,666,667 shares. Prospect "believes
Recognition is trading at a depressed value and is a
turnaround situation," the company's spokesman said. In New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, the company's
shares rose 50 cents, to $5.50.
   -- Noel Group Inc., a New York natural-resources and
energy company. Prospect holds 1,909,090 shares, a 19% stake,
plus one million more that it will receive when Noel Group
exercises an option to buy Wood River Capital Corp., a New
York small-business investment company, from Prospect. Noel
Group is controlled by Louis Marx Jr. of New York, who until
Jan. 19, 1990, was chairman of the Prospect board's asset
committee. Noel is expected to go public in the next two or
three years, Prospect's spokesman said.
   Prospect had an about 60% interest in National Spirit
Group Inc., a Dallas operator of cheerleader camps, and in
February definitively agreed to sell it to BSN Corp. for $40
million. The deal fell through in April, however, and later
that month, National Spirit Group filed under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code.

   Rite Aid Corp., the nation's largest drugstore chain, and
its president will go to trial today in Cleveland on charges
that they tried to bribe a member of the Ohio Board of
Pharmacy.
   Attorneys for the company say a judge's ruling last week
that some taped conversations of Rite Aid president Martin L.
Grass can't be used as trial evidence was a key victory.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Grass and the company are charged with paying a member
of the Ohio Board of Pharmacy $33,000 to resign as part of an
alleged scheme to pack the board with people more friendly to
Shiremanstown, Pa.-based Rite Aid. The company insists the
payment was a legitimate buy-out of an existing consulting
contract with the board member, Melvin T. Wilczynski.
   Last week, Cuyahoga County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court Judge
Lillian Greene ruled that pharmacy-board investigators had no
authority to tape conversations between Mr. Grass and Mr.
Wilczynski because bribery doesn't fall under the board's
jurisdiction. The judge suppressed three taped conversations
but said a fourth tape and a videotape of the payment could
be used at the trial. The two tapes were made by Cuyahoga
County sheriff's officers.
   John Jeffries, professor of law at the University of
Virginia, called the suppression of the tapes "very
surprising" and "hostile to the prosecution." He says such
taping is legal under federal law because one party to the
conversations, Mr. Wilczynski, consented.
   Rite Aid attorney George J. Moscarino, of the Cleveland
law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, says the ruling will
help prove Rite Aid's innocence. "The ruling finally enables
us to show the tremendous bias and outrageous misconduct of
the pharmacy-board investigators," Mr. Moscarino says. He
contends board investigators had a grudge against Rite Aid
and "venue shopped" after a prosecutor in another county
refused to bring the charges.
   Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William R. Caine, who
brought the case against the company, declined to comment.
   But others close to the case said the suppressed tapes
aren't crucial to the prosecution. They say prosecutors can
rely on the videotape of an April 27, 1989, meeting in a
Cleveland airport hotel room. The tape shows Mr. Grass
handing Mr. Wilczynski a corporate check and six copies of an
undated resignation letter to Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste,
which Mr. Grass instructed him to sign. On the tape, Mr.
Grass said that Gov. Celeste had agreed to appoint a Rite Aid
official as Mr. Wilczynski's successor on the board.
   A spokesman for Gov. Celeste vigorously denied an
agreement.

   LENDER LIABILITY LIMITED in some environmental cases by
Colorado statute.
   The law, which took effect July 1, is designed to shield
financial institutions in situations where they have
foreclosed on loans to companies that own or operate property
contaminated with hazardous substances. Because lenders
acquire such properties in foreclosure, they're increasingly
named as defendants in environmental damage suits filed by
adjoining landowners and others who contend their property
values have been hurt by the pollution.
   The Colorado law exempts lenders from these so-called
third-party claims if the contamination occurred before the
lender acquired the property. Even if it occurred afterwards,
a lender may be exempt if it had the property properly
inspected before foreclosing and didn't "knowingly and
recklessly" cause the pollution.
   Colorado is the first state to impose such limits on
lender liability, but the law is attracting considerable
attention from other states, says John Byrne, senior counsel
at the American Bankers Association in Washington, D.C. "It's
a positive change," says Mr. Byrne.
   Some environmentalists had contended that the law unfairly
limits a plaintiff's right to sue. But Colorado bankers
countered that it will help small businesses that handle
hazardous materials. They said banks were refusing to make
loans to such companies because of the prospect of litigation
if the lender had to foreclose. "This law eliminates some of
the uncertainty," says Jac K. Sperling, an attorney with
Denver-based Fairfield &amp; Woods, counsel for the Colorado
Bankers Association.
   However, Mr. Byrne notes that the law doesn't restrict a
lender's liability for cleanup costs (as distinct from
property-damage costs) at a site owned by a company to which
it lent money.
   Last May a decision by the federal appeals court in
Atlanta apparently expanded the potential cleanup liability
of financial institutions.

   FREE-SPEECH PROTECTION for fund-raisers eroded in New York
ruling.
   Philanthropists who feel deceived by fund-raising
campaigns may sue charities in New York for fraud and
misrepresentation without having to prove the charities
intended to deceive givers. The decision was part of a state
appeals court ruling in a case brought by several American
Jewish donors against the Jewish National Fund.
   The donors filed the suit in September 1988, claiming that
the fund had violated New York consumer protection laws by
leading them to believe that donations aided tree planting in
all of Israel, including the territories occupied after the
1967 war with Arab countries. The fund, however, only plants
trees in land held before the war.
   The charity challenged one part of a lower court ruling,
which ordered it to state in its literature that it does not
plant trees in occupied territories. The plaintiffs
challenged another part of the lower court ruling that
dismissed the claim that the fund had violated New York
consumer protection laws.
   In a 4-1 decision, the Appellate Division of the state
Supreme Court reinstated the plaintiffs' consumer law claim
and upheld the injunction (requiring explanation of where the
trees will be planted) imposed by the lower court. "While the
solicitation of charitable donations is a form of protected
speech, it is subject to narrowly drawn government regulation
designed to protect the public from fraud or other deceptive
practices," the court ruled.
   The dissenting judge wrote that "the leading case on
charitable solicitation . . . makes it clear that such
solicitations involve speech protected by the First
Amendment."
   The plaintiffs' lawyer, Howard Rubin of Goldman, Drazen,
Rick, Steiner &amp; Rubin, says the ruling means that anyone who
gives money based on statements calculated to persuade now
has the right to sue for fraud.
   The fund's lawyer, Stephen Wagner of Anderson Kill Olick &amp;
Oshinsky, says he will probably appeal. If upheld by the
Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state, the ruling
will force all advertisers -- not just charities -- to screen
all advertising and campaign copy closely to weed out
statements that might be construed as deceptive, regardless
of the intent, Mr. Wagner said. Such a decision might
persuade courts in other states to construe their consumer
laws in the same broad manner, he said.
   "It will be a very grave restriction of the First
Amendment rights" of anyone who advertises, Mr. Wagner warns.

   JUDGE DENIES UNUSUAL REQUEST in libel suit.
   Federal Judge Edward S. Northrop of Baltimore ruled last
week that National Life Insurance Co., a Montpelier,
Vt.-based insurance company, isn't entitled to receive the
names and addresses of people who received copies of
allegedly defamatory materials.
   National Life had sought the information in connection
with a suit it filed in May seeking $13 million in damages
against Phillips Publishing Inc., a Potomac, Md.-based
publisher of consumer and trade newsletters and magazines,
and Richard E. Band, a financial analyst who edits a Phillips
publication called Richard E. Band's Profitable Investing.
   The suit alleges that in a series of special reports,
articles and promotional materials, Mr. Band made false and
defamatory statements about the company's financial stability
that damaged its reputation and business. The Wall Street
Digest Inc., a Sarasota, Fla.-based financial newsletter
publisher that reprinted one of Mr. Band's articles, is also
a defendant in the suit.
   The defendants deny the allegations.
   National Life sought the names of subscribers and the
approximately one million people who recieved promotional
material containing Mr. Band's findings. Profitable Investing
has 2,400 subscribers; the Wall Street Digest has 25,000.
   Theodore Sherbow, a lawyer with the Baltimore firm of
Weinberg &amp; Green who is representing National Life, said the
request was an attempt by the company to engage in
"self-help" to correct the false information, as urged by
former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell in another
libel case.
   But Bruce W. Sanford, in the Washington, D.C., office of
Cleveland-based Baker &amp; Hostetler, attorneys for Phillips and
Mr. Band, said National Life's request would have resulted in
"the court helping them engage in a war of public opinion
rather than a war of litigation."
   In his ruling, Judge Northrop wrote that the information
didn't seem relevant to National Life's case at the present
time, but said the company could resubmit its request at a
later date.

   FORMER CONGRESSMAN'S extortion conviction in Wedtech
scandal is overturned.
   A federal appeals court reversed the convictions of former
U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, of New York, and his wife, Jane Lee
Garcia, who were convicted in October. Mr. Garcia, a Democrat
who had represented the Bronx for six terms, resigned
earlier.
   The court ruled that insufficient evidence may have been
presented to prove that the Garcias committed extortion. The
case stemmed from payments and loans that Wedtech Corp., a
defunct defense contractor in the Bronx, made to the Garcias
in return for favors by the congressman.
   The appeals-court panel said prosecutors failed to prove
that Wedtech made the payments out of fear of economic loss,
one of the legal definitions of extortion. Instead, the
appeals court said, "By paying the Garcias, Wedtech was
purchasing an advocate, not buying off a thug."
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office said no
decision has been made on whether to appeal the decision.

Senate aide. The commission establishes guidelines for
criminal sentences in the federal courts.

   Family Leave Bill
   Vetoed; Override
   Believed Unlikely

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush vetoed a bill that would
guarantee workers leave from their jobs of as much as 12
weeks a year for childbirth, adoption or serious family
illnesses.
   Mr. Bush, whose veto was expected, said he opposes the
legislation because of its "rigid, federally imposed
requirements." Noting that U.S. companies face their
"stiffest competition in history," he said employers need
flexibility in offering benefits to workers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The veto was the president's 13th since he took office,
and is likely to be sustained by Congress, as were his
previous 12 vetoes. But Democrats seem certain to seize on
the veto as a campaign issue. They noted that Mr. Bush
pledged in his 1988 election campaign to protect women's
jobs, though he didn't specify whether he favored any federal
family-leave requirement.
   "No working mother should be forced to choose between the
child she loves and the job she needs," Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, said.
"The president might as well try to veto motherhood."
   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), the measure's chief
sponsor, has said the Senate, which approved the bill by a
voice vote earlier last month, is within two or three votes
of the necessary two-thirds margin to override the veto. But
in the House, "It's going to be a tough road" to win enough
support for an override, said an aide to Rep. Curt Weldon
(R., Pa.), a leading House sponsor of the bill. The House
passed the bill in May by a 237-187 margin, 50 votes short of
override strength.
   "I do not want Republicans to be blamed for killing the
Family and Medical Leave Act," Mr. Weldon said of the bill.
   Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, another Republican who
backed the bill, said in an interview that she was "stunned
and dismayed" by the speed of the veto of a bill offering a
"minimum job benefit," and noted that Mr. Bush declined to
meet with some GOP members of Congress on the issue. The
president "has signed mandates before," she said. "I don't
know why he has a blind spot on this one."
   While women's and family-oriented organizations decried
the veto, business groups applauded it.
   "Mandated parental leave is not only an anti-business
idea, but . . . it discriminates against those unable to take
advantage of the leave, discriminates against those forced on
overtime because of its requirements, and discriminates
against those who would prefer other fringe benefits, which
would be eliminated if this measure were enacted," said John
Sloan, president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, a small-business group.

   Junk Bonds Ride a Long Comeback Trail

   NEW YORK -- Junk bonds, the sorriest securities in the
fixed-income market just a few months ago, are climbing out
of their deep hole.
   The high-risk, high-yield bonds posted a total return of
4.31% in the second-quarter, according to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
Statistics compiled by First Boston Corp., which unlike
Merrill Lynch includes in its study highly volatile
zero-coupon bonds, said junk bonds posted a total return of
5.74% in the second quarter. Only convertibles, which are
bonds that can be exchanged for stock, outperformed junk
during the second quarter, thanks largely to a soaring stock
market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the returns for junk bonds are respectable, they are
far from spectacular considering investors could have gotten
similar returns by investing in long-term Treasury bonds.
Long-term Treasurys posted a total return of 4.30% in the
second quarter after a negative 4.02% return in the first
quarter. And investing in Treasurys, which are considered the
safest securities in the world, doesn't create the nail
bitting, sweaty palms and sleepless nights that have come
with investing in junk.
   Still, junk's second-quarter performance represents an
important turning point for a market that nearly collapsed
last September. Junk bonds posted negative total returns
(interest payments plus price changes) in this year's first
quarter and the fourth quarter of 1989.
   The current junk-bond recovery could come to a screeching
halt if the economy contracts or if interest rates rise. And
with prices of most middle-tier and lower-tier junk bonds
trading at substantial discounts to their face value, prices
have a long upward climb before they are anywhere near full
face value.
   "We are not ready to call it a huge, dramatic rally, but
you will see better overall performance," said Joseph C.
Bencivenga, director and manager of high-yield research at
Salomon Brothers Inc. He said that while prices were bid
higher for many junk bonds, trading was active in a limited
number of issues.
   But Sam DeRosa-Farag, an analyst at First Boston Corp.,
said that technical indicators for junk appear bullish. The
advance-decline ratio, for example, shows marked improvement.
Mr. DeRosa-Farag said that of the 352 junk-bond issues he
followed in the month of June, 4.6 junk bond issues advanced
for each one that declined.
   Another sign that sentiment is improving, he said, is that
buying has moved from the "higher quality" junk to
middle-tier and lower-tier bonds.
   "The best paper always pops first," Mr. DeRosa-Farag said.
"Then, as sentiment improves, people start to venture down
the capital structure and begin to look at the lower tiers."
Stronger purchases of middle-tier and lower-tier junk bonds
may explain why B-rated junk bonds posted a total return of
8.12% in the second quarter, outperforming junk bonds that
had higher credit ratings.
   Top-tier junk bonds, such as those issued by Kroger Co.
and Duracell Inc., have little room for capital appreciation
because they already trade at premiums to their face values.
   The turnaround in long-term Treasurys represents yet
another about-face for a market that has shifted gears
several times this year.
   Treasury-bond prices fell sharply in January when rising
interest rates around the world pulled bond yields higher.
Treasurys fell further in April on stronger-than-expected
economic data and fears of higher interest rates.
   But since May, the market has been rising on growing
speculation that the economy is growing weaker and, more
recently, on optimism that efforts are underway to cut the
size of the U.S. budget deficit. These trends are considered
good for bonds because a weaker economy and smaller deficit
could prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
   James Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill
Lynch, said the factors that fueled the bond market's
rollercoaster performance during the first half of 1990
remain in place. This makes bond-market forecasting extremely
difficult.
   "The market begins the second half under the influence of
two opposing forces -- a soft domestic economy that could
prompt Fed easing and booming economies overseas that could
spark central-bank tightening," Mr. Kochan said.
   By far the best performers in the second quarter were
zero-coupon bonds. Zeros, which pay no interest and are sold
at a deep discount to face value, racked up a total return of
12.05% in the second quarter, according to First Boston.
   Zeros are extremely volatile and their prices tend to
surge when the interest rates fall and plummet when interest
rates rise. The securities are generally three times more
volatile than cash-paying bonds with similar maturities.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices ended with gains for the fourth straight
session on growing optimism that the federal budget deficit
will soon be reduced.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 point, a
gain of about $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
bond's price was quoted late Friday at a price of 103 23/32
to yield 8.40%.
   The bond market began to advance on Tuesday, lifted by
news that President Bush had said that tax revenue increases
are needed to shrink the budget deficit. On Friday, Mr. Bush
reiterated his stance and said that higher taxes are a
"necessary step to get stalled budget negotiations moving."
   In the corporate bond market, investment grade bonds ended
1/4 point higher, while junk bonds were little changed.
   Among the notable exceptions to the junk market's quiet
tone were the bonds of Stone Container Corp. and Charter
Medical Corp., which posted strong gains, and those of Carter
Hawley Hale Stores Inc., which continued to weaken.
   Stone Container's debt securities climbed on news that the
company will use $65 million from the sale of timberland to
repay debt. Stone Container's 11.5% senior subordinated
notes, maturing in 1999, advanced 3/8 point to end at 93 3/8.
The gain in Stone Container bonds comes amid reports that
second-quarter earnings for paper producers will be lower
than year-earlier results.
   The bonds of Charter Medical advanced despite a
credit-rating downgrading by Moody's Investors Service Inc.,
which cut Charter Medical's senior debt ratings to single-B-2
from single-B-1, and its subordinated and junior subordinated
debentures to Caa from single-B-3. Charter Medical's 14%
senior subordinated debentures, due in 2000, finished 1/2

   General Instrument, Forstmann Little
   Are Considering Buy-Out, Sources Say

   NEW YORK -- General Instrument Corp. has held talks with
Forstmann, Little &amp; Co. about a leveraged buy-out of the
electronic components company valued at more than $1.1
billion, according to people familiar with the talks.
   Off-and-on negotiations between the company and Forstmann,
which are both based here, have apparently heated up again in
recent days. Barring some last-minute snag, an announcement
of some transaction could occur this week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   General Instrument had about 27.5 million shares
outstanding as of late last year. Its stock closed at $36.25
a share, up 50 cents, in composite trading Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange. A $1.1 billion buy-out would equal $40 a
share, but the actual price could well be higher.
   A spokesman for General Instrument, reached at the company
offices yesterday, said, "It is company policy not to comment
on rumor or speculation." He wouldn't elaborate. Forstmann's
chief strategist, Theodore Forstmann, couldn't be reached for
comment.
   General Instrument is best-known for making cable TV
equipment, particularly boxes that process and scramble
signals, as well as semiconductors and wagering systems for
race tracks. In its fiscal year ended Feb. 28, it earned
$98.7 million, or $3.27 a share, on revenue of $1.38 billion.
   General Instrument's stock had been under pressure earlier
this year because of concerns about government regulation of
the cable TV business, and because of the delay of a large
order for cable TV equipment. Its chairman and chief
executive officer is Frank G. Hickey.
   Forstmann, Little is one of the few leveraged buy-out
firms that has been aggressively seeking to do large buy-outs
despite the collapse of the market for high-risk, high-yield
"junk" bonds, which usually help finance such buy-outs.
   That's because Forstmann has its own fund of subordinated
debt, contributed by the same investors who provide the
equity for the leveraged acquisitions. That subordinated debt
fund substitutes for junk bonds in most Forstmann buy-outs.
   Earlier this year, Forstmann exploited this financing
capability by negotiating an $825 million acquisition of the
Gulfstream business jet aircraft manufacturer from Chrysler
Corp., which wanted to leave the airplane market.
   The Gulfstream purchase involved only bank debt and both
equity and subordinated debt from Forstmann investors. Mr.
Forstmann has been a consistent critic of junk bonds, warning
that they endangered the financial health of companies that
used them.
   If the Forstmann talks do result in a buy-out proposal,
General Instrument would be one of only a few major publicly
held corporations whose management attempted a buy-out since
the bid for RJR Nabisco Inc., subsequently completed in early
1989 by another group at a price of $25 billion. Since then,
many top executives have been wary of possible criticism that
they could profit from a buy-out at shareholders' expense.
   A possible buy-out bid could always be topped by another
corporation interested in General Instrument for strategic
reasons. But because of the weakness of the junk-bond market,
there is less likely to be competition from other buy-out
funds.

as of April 30.
   Eliot Savings, which had a $50.5 million loss last year,
was hurt by the slump in the real estate market, as were many
financial institutions in New England. Analysts have said
they expect more bank failures in the region in months to
come.

   U.S. Middle Class
   Squeezed in 1980s,
   House Liberals Say

   WASHINGTON -- The American middle class was squeezed
during the 1980s, while the rich prospered, according to an
analysis by influential House liberals that previews the
coming debate in Congress over what taxes to raise.
   "They {the middle class} didn't come to the party," the
Democratic Study Group concluded in a report prepared for
release today. "Don't send them the bill."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With President Bush's "no new taxes" pledge now history,
many Democrats are focusing more on the nature of the taxes
to be increased as part of a deficit-reduction compromise.
The DSG last week released a letter signed by 134 members of
Congress who vowed to oppose any compromise that adds to the
tax burden on working- and middle-class families rather than
the very wealthy.
   The Bush administration and many congressional Republicans
are talking about higher consumption taxes of various kinds
-- for instance, on cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline, energy.
They oppose raising income-tax rates on upper-income
taxpayers. With President Bush determined to cut the
capital-gains tax, which would benefit upper-income
taxpayers, Democrats are resolved to offset that by raising
some other taxes paid by those same people.
   "People who should pay are the ones who benefited from the
Reagan party," Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), a member of the
House Ways and Means Committee, said last week.
   On NBC News' "Meet the Press" yesterday, New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo said any tax changes should balance the tax
burden. "This isn't a question of sacrificing the rich, it's
getting the rich to catch up with the middle class and the
poor," said Mr. Cuomo. "You've already taxed {the poor and
middle class} by cutting off the states, by forcing us to tax
gasoline, real estate, sales taxes. That's the poor people,
that's the middle class that get hit disproportionately."
   The DSG report notes, as other analysts have, that wages
failed to keep pace with inflation during the 1980s. Because
more and more women went to work, inflation-adjusted median
family income did rise, though.
   But, the DSG argues, families that sent second
wage-earners to work may not have seen their standard of
living rise. "A family which requires two earnings is less
well off than a one-earner family with the same income," it
argues.
   Based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data gathered during
the early 1980s, the group says child-care and other
work-related expenses consume between 20% and 30% of the
added income. As a result, the net contribution of second
earners wasn't sufficient to offset fully the general decline
in wage levels, the group said.
   Two-earner families saved less and were slightly less
likely to own a home than single-earner families with the
same family income, the DSG said.

   Whittle Communications Limited Partnership said it hired
Joan Lunden, co-host of ABC-TV's "Good Morning America,"

play in doctors' waiting rooms, beginning in the fall.
   Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., and 50%-owned by Time
Warner Inc., New York, said it hopes its Special Reports
Television will play in as many as 20,000 family doctors'
offices by January. The TV system will be coupled with
Whittle's Special Reports magazines, which are distributed in
about 19,000 medical offices. Whittle said about
three-fourths of the physicians who receive these magazines
have signed up for the TV program.

   Whittle takes in about $40 million a year in advertising
from the magazines and hopes to double the revenue with the
addition of the TV show, which will have an hour-long format
divided into eight segments on family issues and be updated
every two weeks on videodisk.
   A spokeswoman for ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.,
New York, said Ms. Lunden recently signed a new five-year

   Big Bets Ride on Budding Cell Research

   Research percolating in molecular biology laboratories
could give scientists tools to shut down the cellular
machinery underlying arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis
and other diseases caused by a hyperactive immune system.
   And while biologists caution that it's a long, uncertain
path from the lab to marketable drugs, an unusually
high-powered group of investors is betting that a small
Seattle company can deliver on this latest biotech promise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Recent experiments suggest how certain white blood cells
that circulate in the bloodstream pass through blood vessel
walls and into joints and other body sites. In normal,
regulated amounts, these white blood cells trigger the body's
defense against infection from bacteria or viruses. But
unchecked, these cells can accumulate dangerously, producing
the swelling, pain and tissue damage characteristic of
diseases in which the body's defensive mechanism, for reasons
unknown, turns upon itself.
   A team of scientists in Seattle believes it can create
drugs that would jam the pathways through which
inflammation-causing cells travel from the bloodstream to
specific sites near bone joints, in the lungs and in the
brain. The scientists caution that the research is in its
infancy and that such drugs could be years away.
   Nonetheless, several Seattle entrepreneurs have hooked up
with these scientists, forming a new company to turn the
nascent science into medical treatments. The start-up, called
Icos Corp., brashly predicts that medicines from the new
research will provide significant advances over current
therapy, and, in the case of multiple sclerosis, provide
treatment where none now exists.
   Some biotech industry experts are skeptical about the
company's business prospects, and its ability to pay back
initial investors. But scientists familiar with the research
at the company's core say Icos's strategy is certain to
intensify the increasingly competitive world-wide hunt for
better anti-inflammatory drugs, for which there's huge
potential: About 37 million Americans, plagued by some form
of arthritis, spend an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion a
year on all sorts of medication. While the Icos approach to
treatment -- preventing the inflammation -- is perhaps the
least developed of any being pursued by researchers, some
believe it is the most promising.
   "If we're successful, the drugs we develop would be the
first to actually halt the production of unwanted
inflammation," says Robert Nowinski, Icos's 44-year-old
president and chief executive officer. "Current medicines for
arthritis and asthma simply relieve symptoms associated with
inflammation, but we hope to stop the inflammation before it
ever gets started."
   Mr. Nowinski, a biologist of some note, is nothing if not
confident. He made a bundle in 1985 selling to Bristol-Myers
the biotech venture he started in 1981, Genetic Systems. Last
September, Mr. Nowinski walked out of a top research
management post at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., chafing at the
big New York company's bureaucracy.
   Heading back home to Seattle with only the vaguest of
notions about starting another biotech company, Mr. Nowinski
jumped at an offer from Isaac and David Blech, two Seattle
venture capitalists who had backed his first enterprise.
Christopher Henney, who until last year was a research
director at Immunex Corp., another Seattle biotech firm, was
the first person Mr. Nowinski contacted. "We each had a
shopping list of research areas, but the anti-inflammation
work ranked highest for both of us," recalls Mr. Henney, who
is now Icos director of research.
   Within six months, Mr. Nowinski enlisted two top biotech
industry executives to help manage the company, and an entire
team of scientists from a world-famous research institute.
   With the help of PaineWebber Inc., he talked 400 investors
into putting up a total of $33 million, the largest private
funding ever for a new, unproven biotech firm. Big names in
business signed on: Walter Wriston, former head of Citicorp,
and Frank Carey, a former chairman of IBM, were both
persuaded to join Icos's board. William Gates, chairman of
the Seattle-based software giant Microsoft Corp., was urged
to invest, becoming the company's single-biggest shareholder
with a 10% stake.
   By building a high-tech company with a lot of hurry and
hoopla, Mr. Nowinski is risking criticism as hyping
discoveries prematurely. In fact, in a 1989 book called "Gene
Dreams," author Robert Teitelman skewers Mr. Nowinski's
involvement in Genetic Systems as overselling the promise of
biotechnology.
   But since the forming of Icos, Mr. Nowinski has stumbled
across several research advances that, he is convinced, will
help Icos beat Merck &amp; Co. and other pharmaceutical giants
racing to find new anti-inflammatory drugs. The new research,
described in just a handful of recent scientific articles, is
designed to selectively block the action of proteins and
enzymes, which, like traffic cops, route the body's white
blood cells to their destination.
   Mr. Henney knew of "cutting edge" research taking place at
the nearby Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. A small
team of scientists there are among the first anywhere to
identify molecules, called "adhesion" proteins, embedded
within the inside lining -- the endothelium -- of tiny blood
capillaries. When a wound occurs, such as a splinter in the
skin, these adhesion proteins extend into the bloodstream
like fishing hooks, latching onto specific white blood cells
floating by.
   The blood cells and the hooks are linked by protrusions on
their surfaces that fit snugly into one another. Once bound
together, the adhesion proteins draw the blood cells through
the capillary wall and into the tissue site, where they mount
an inflammatory attack of other immune system agents to
counter infection.
   "The power of the technology is that these adhesion
proteins differ from site to site in the body," says Thomas
St. John, who along with Michael Gallatin and their
colleagues are rushing to identify the structure of each of
the protein's "hooking" sites. Icos believes the white blood
cells' path into the tissue site could be barricaded with
drugs that home in on the hooking sites only of those cells
involved in unwanted inflammation.
   By January, Messrs. Nowinski and Henney had hired away the
Fred Hutchinson center scientists. The two men also persuaded
George Rathmann, chairman and founder of Amgen Corp., a
California biotech concern, to sign on as chairman of the
Icos board.
   About then, Mr. Nowinski was approached by officials at
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island offering the
rights to a new technology they felt could quicken the
company's efforts to find drugs blocking the cells' homing
sites. Moreover, the Cold Spring Harbor researchers had
identified enzymes within immune system cells that direct
them to carry out an anti-inflammatory response.
   Mr. Nowinski hopes the company -- with the combination of
the Hutchinson and Cold Spring research -- may have an
inflammation-blocking drug for testing in animals within two
years. But drug industry observers say Icos will also need a
hefty dose of luck.
   "I can't criticize the technology," says Jeffrey Jay, who
runs Canaan Partners, a biomedical venture capital group.
"But it's going to take a lot more money and a lot of time
for them to succeed." Moreover, he says, the need to raise
capital will "greatly" dilute current shareholders' value.
"It's not an investment I'd recommend right now," he says.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Growth-Stock Managers See New Gains

   `Value' Investors
   Have Other Ideas

   NEW YORK -- Growth was golden in the first half of 1990.
   The growth-stock managers who are having a stupendous year
with stocks such as Compaq Computer, Merry-Go-Round
Enterprises and Home Depot -- all up more than 20% in the
second quarter -- predict more of the same in the second
half.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Not so, protest the "value" investors, whose hunt for
bargain-priced stocks has saddled them with sizable holdings
of lagging bank, auto and basic materials issues. They
predict a sharp second-half advance for shares of companies
whose fortunes are linked to the economic cycle.
   Who's right will depend largely on which way the economy
swings. Right now, investors and economists are divided over
whether economic growth will speed up or slow further.
Polarized thinking on this topic is one reason why the Dow
Jones Industrial Average has drifted between 2850 and 2900
over the past two weeks.
   But scanning the list of winning stocks and industry
groups leaves little doubt about the dominant investment
theme so far this year. "The thing that's driving the stock
market right now is earnings momentum," says Byron Wien,
chief U.S. investment strategist for Morgan Stanley. "What's
not driving the market is value."
   The software, communications and semiconductor industry
groups are full of companies growing earnings at 15% a year
or better. Winning stocks such as Storage Technology, up
189.4% so far this year, have impressed investors with their
unique products, dominant market shares and their leap-frog
earnings advances in a time of slowing economic growth.
   But value investors, who specialize in sniffing out stocks
trading at discounts to their worth, say the game isn't over
yet.
   "There is more than one way to skin a cat in this market,"
says Mr. Wien. "Everybody is focusing on growth stocks, but
an investor could make it in cyclical stocks, too." Mr. Wien
is a growth stock enthusiast, but he also has one third of
his portfolio dedicated to economically sensitive issues,
such as Ford and Fluor.
   No doubt, cyclical stocks are cheap, a sign that most
investors expect more slow economic growth. Aluminum Co. of
America, for example, is trading at a ratio of price to
per-share earnings of about 7, compared with 16.52 for
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   But "if the economy picks up, cyclical stocks will do
better than the growth stocks," says value investor Paul
Lesutis, a director at Provident Capital Management.
   Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. economist Giulio Martini
expects the economy to snap back with 4.5% growth in the
second half of this year from about 2% in the first half,
with much of strength coming from a rebuilding of inventories
by all kinds of companies, such as auto and chemical
manufacturers.
   "When the economy turns out to be stronger, the
underestimation of earnings will be greatest for those
companies that are sensitive to the economy," Mr. Martini
says.
   First-half weakness was related to inventory liquidations,
Mr. Martini argues. "Once you get stimulation on the
production side, you will have more income creating more
consumer spending," he says. He expects the unemployment rate
to drop to 4.3% a year from now compared with slighty more
than 5% currently, and inflation to rise to more than 6% from
about 5% currently. The Federal Reserve could even raise
interest rates later this summer, Mr. Martini predicts.
   Some investors are already second-guessing growth stocks,
not so much because of their investment style but because
these stocks may not meet their high earnings expectations.
At the end of the second quarter, money managers showed a
preference for stocks such as Procter &amp; Gamble that are
indeed growth companies but are less prone to negative
earnings surprises.
   The rotation in leadership of stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average tells the story best. Procter &amp; Gamble and
Merck, two blue-chip consumer stocks, accounted for 22.1% and
19.7%, respectively, of the Dow industrials' 173.48-point
gain in the second quarter, according to Birinyi Associates,
a stock research firm. But for the first half, technology
bellwether International Business Machines accounted for
37.1% of the Dow industrials' 127.49-point gain, Birinyi
says.
   "The market is terrified of earnings disappointments
currently," says Kent Simons, general partner and fund
manager at Neuberger &amp; Berman, which is why "investors are
running to Procter &amp; Gamble, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola Co. and
McDonald's."
   Mr. Simons and his partner Larry Marx say that many growth
stocks -- be they technology or consumer issues -- are so
expensive that they are now riskier than some of the shares
of basic industrial companies that aren't growing earnings as
fast. "There is earnings risk in Alcoa, but it is arguable
that there is more risk in the price of Johnson &amp; Johnson"
because earnings expectations for the drug stock are high,
says Mr. Marx.
   Growth stock investors expect slow economic growth, a mild
drop in interest rates and declining inflation this year.
Lower interest rates will make bonds less competitive,
enhancing the relative appeal to investors of the high-growth
companies -- especially if the earnings of cyclical companies
deteriorate further.
   Michael Strauss, chief economist for UBS Securities,
expects the economy to slow to such an extent that bonds will
be a better investment than stocks.
   "In the second half we will get a major slowdown in
consumer spending," he predicts. Mr. Strauss foresees the
economy growing at less than 1.5% in the second half. He
expects unemployment to rise, weak sales, and, naturally,
poor corporate profits. Mr. Strauss says the consumer has
lost his punch. And the performance of some retail stocks
recently shows those fears. J.C. Penney was down 11.5% last
quarter to 60 5/8.
   But it is precisely in such an economic environment that
companies with dominant products continue to earn more than
concerns subject to the economic cycle. "I continue to
believe they (growth stocks) will maintain leadership," says
Michael Schonberg, a growth stock investor and managing
director at Chase Investors Management Corp.
   Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley says the debate between the
growth stock managers and the value investors will be settled
this summer. Meanwhile, investors should fasten their seat
belts because changes in sentiment are likely to be
explosive.
   "Precarious balances don't endure forever," says Mr. Wien
in a recent report. "The factors producing the standoff are
too powerful. Something will change."

International fell 3/4 to 26 on a report that the company's
employees in Honduras went on strike.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises rose 1 to 16. There was speculation
that Coca-Cola Co., which owns a 49% stake in the bottler,
may soon bid for the rest.

   LOS ANGELES -- TransTechnology Corp. posted a fiscal
fourth-quarter loss of $4.6 million, or 90 cents a share, and
said it suspended its dividend as part of a revised credit
agreement with its bank lenders.
   In the year-ago quarter, the maker of aerospace and
industrial products earned $5.3 million, or $1.02 a share.
Revenue fell 13% to $62.4 million from $71.6 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   TransTechnology had a loss from continuing operations of
$3 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with earnings from
continuing operations of $5.3 million, or $1.23 a share, a
year earlier. Two unprofitable units were recently sold.
   Lee M. Parker, vice president, said the fourth-quarter
loss included "between $10 million and $12 million" in
write-downs, reflecting mainly inventory adjustments and an
increase in reserves for environmental cleanup of a facility.
TransTechnology's computer graphics business also was hurt by
the loss of a major customer.
   Last month, TransTechnology cautioned that it would report
a loss for the quarter and year. In January, Chairman Arch
Scurlock predicted a strong fourth quarter that would "put
the company solidly in the black" for fiscal 1990.
   Mr. Parker said Friday that "once it became apparent we
would be running a loss for the whole year, it became
advantageous to recognize things we might have debated with
auditors on and maximize the losses that will allow us to go
back and file for income tax refunds and generate income
tax-loss carry-forwards."
   For the year, the company had a loss of $8.4 million, or
$1.64 a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $9.2
million, or $1.80 a share. Revenue fell to $198.5 million
from $219 million. The full-year loss from continuing
operations was $3.3 million, or 64 cents a share, compared
with year-ago earnings from continuing operations of $12.3
million, or $2.39 a share.
   TransTechnology said that last week it reached agreement
with its bank lenders led by Bank of America in Los Angeles
for a $37 million loan to replace a $40 million revolving
credit facility. Mr. Parker said TransTechnology has borrowed
about $34 million of the $37 million available.
   TransTechnology paid a dividend of 24 cents a share on
common stock in June. TransTechnology said that prior to this
year, it had increased its dividend every year for the past
decade.

   A federal court jury in Boston awarded Cool Light Co. of
Hollywood, Calif., $16 million in punitive and compensatory
damages to be paid by GTE Products Corp., a unit of GTE
Corp., Stamford, Conn., for fraud, breach of contract and
failure to deal "fairly and in good faith."
   Cool Light, a maker of television studio lights that
generate 80% less heat than traditional studio lights,
alleged that GTE Products, a Danvers, Mass., lighting
products maker, breached a contract to make parts of Cool
Light's product and subsequently produced its own version of
the light. Cool Light brought in a host of celebrities,
including the actors Michael Landon, Ed Asner and Angie
Dickinson, to testify in the trial on behalf of the light's
inventor, George Panagiotou.

   GTE Products officials denied any wrongdoing and said they
are considering an appeal. "We're disappointed at the jury's

   San Diego Thrift
   Selects Kemper
   To Succeed Luce

   Great American Bank said it replaced longtime chairman and
chief executive officer Gordon Luce, a move that analysts
said reflected stepped-up regulatory control of the troubled
San Diego thrift.
   Great American selected Robert L. Kemper, 61 years old, a
former Wells Fargo &amp; Co. executive, most recently affiliated
with the New York merchant banking firm of Gregory &amp;
Honemeyer. Besides succeeding Mr. Luce as chairman and chief
executive, Mr. Kemper will also assume the post of president,
succeeding Roger K. Lindland. Mr. Lindland's future wasn't
clear, although a Great American trustee said he would
continue as a consultant. The moves are effective today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Great American, the nation's eighth largest thrift, has
been ordered by federal regulators to raise $350 million by
year end or face seizure by the government. Analysts doubt
the company's ability to do that, although officials have
indicated they are trying to sell much of Great American's
lucrative Southern California branch network as a way of
raising the desperately needed cash.
   The move to replace the 64-year-old Mr. Luce, who
announced in May that he would be stepping down sometime this
year, suggested to some analysts that Great American's fate
may soon be resolved. "You could call it a
quasi-conservatorship or a very quiet conservatorship," said
Allan Bortel, an investment banker specializing in thrifts
with Sutro &amp; Co., San Francisco. "It's the regulators' way of
saying `we would like to raise $350 million, but they know
it's not possible.'"
   Mr. Kemper wasn't available for comment. He contended in a
statement that he was "looking forward to addressing the
issues facing the bank and working with its shareholders and
customers."
   His hiring followed what Great American called "an
extensive interview process." The company had earlier tried
to lure James Cirona, Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco
president, as a successor to Mr. Luce, but apparently
couldn't reach financial terms, Great American previously
indicated.
   For Mr. Luce, a former member of Ronald Reagan's informal
group of "Kitchen Cabinet" advisers, the changing of the
guard is a rather swift fall from grace. He joined the
company in 1970 and built it into one of the nation's biggest
thrifts, only to have its financial condition shattered over
the past year by the effects of a 1986 venture into Arizona
real estate.
   Great American said Mr. Luce continues as a trustee.

   Gas Prices Stay Flat, Snapping 2-Summer Trend;
   Low Levels Through Entire Season Are Possibility

   HOUSTON -- Unlike the previous two summers, natural-gas
prices haven't climbed this year and could stay at low levels
through the entire season, industry officials and analysts
say.
   "Terrible, terrible," is how Paul Taylor, a vice president
of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., a large gas producer, describes
the market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This year the price has been flat as a pancake,"
complains Don Salanty, Amoco Corp.'s vice president of
negotiations and sales for natural gas.
   After spot prices climbed as high as $2.25 a thousand
cubic feet in January, the weather turned warm quickly and
gas prices fell like a rock. They've been hovering around
$1.40 since March and without some extreme drought conditions
this summer few expect much of a change.
   "Right now we're looking at gas prices down two cents to
four cents in July," says John Olson, an analyst at First
Boston Corp. "The prospects are the same through the summer,"
he adds.
   In the previous two summers, hot weather sparked increased
use of natural gas by electric utilities, causing prices to
climb. But the situation is different this year.
   For one, there's an oversupply now. The amount of gas in
storage is 5.7% greater than this time last year, according
to First Boston. "Last winter's warm weather is the primary
cause," says a spokesman for Enron Corp., the nation's
largest natural-gas pipeline company.
   Normally, gas producers, pipelines and customers put gas
in storage ahead of winter because a cold snap can stretch
the system's ability to deliver gas during this period of
peak demand. But with the winter heating season about 21%
warmer than normal, demand was weak. "The excess supply has
been with us since," says Mr. Salanty of Amoco.
   "This industry keeps getting surprised by weather
patterns," says Mr. Taylor of Anadarko. "Demand can swing
100% from summer to winter." So far this year, industrywide
demand is off about 5%.
   A more than $8-a-barrel plunge in crude oil prices this
year has also depressed gas prices because certain gas
customers can switch fairly easily between gas and certain
crude products.
   "We're beginning to see fuel-switching in the Northeast
because of cratering fuel prices," says Mr. Olson of First
Boston, with some customers opting to burn residual fuel oil
instead of gas. "We haven't faced resid competition in
years," Mr. Taylor says.
   Natural-gas prices for some customers in the New York
area, for instance, could total as much as $2.40 a thousand
cubic feet after transportation charges are added, Mr. Olson
says. Residual fuel can be bought at New York Harbor for
around $2.08 for the energy equivalent, he adds. Similar
price competitiveness exists on the Gulf Coast too, gas
producers say.
   "We're getting some gas turned back to us" because of fuel
switching, Mr. Salanty says.
   Some companies reduce their gas output in the face of low
prices but not enough are now doing this industrywide to put
supply and demand more in balance. "We started curtailing
production in February," says Mr. Taylor. Andarko, one of the
more extreme examples, had peak production of 540 million
cubic feet of gas a day in February and sold an average of
360 million cubic feet daily in June.
   While most natural gas is currently bought and sold in
30-day contracts, for the first time, a natural-gas futures
contract began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
April and it seems too early to tell if it will catch on.
"It's not a major player yet," says Mr. Salanty, though Amoco
is watching it closely. Mr. Salanty says that the New York
Merc's crude oil contract is so successful because oil
producers and consumers actively trade. Those players are
mostly absent from the gas contract right now, he says.
   But the New York Merc said that just 58 days into trading
of the gas contract, open interest exceeded the level reached
by the crude oil contract in the same time period after its
launch in 1983. Since its birth, the crude contract has
reshaped world oil markets.
   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Meats and Livestock
                                                                                                       

   Futures traders will react today to a Friday report by the
government that hog farmers intend to begin rebuilding their
herds this fall.
   A tight supply of hogs helped push prices to record levels
this spring, and that in turn is causing record retail prices
for pork in the supermarket.
   After the close of trading Friday, the Agriculture
Department reported that a survey of hog farmers indicates
they are planning for the birth of 2% more piglets in
September, October and November than in the like 1989 period.
   If that materializes, the tight supply of fattened hogs in
the U.S. should begin to ease by early next year.
   The forecast was included in a quarterly survey of hog
farmers by the Agriculture Department.
   So far, at least, the nation's hog herd is continuing to
slip. According to the department, the number of hogs in the
U.S. on June 1 was down 3% from that date in 1989.
   The department's report was generally in line with
expectations by livestock analysts, according to Jerry
Abbenhaus, a livestock analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, St.
Louis.
                                                                                                       

   Precious Metals
                                                                                                       

   Silver and gold futures finished last week on a strong
note, though analysts say there were no new fundamental
factors driving the market. William O'Neill, futures analyst
for Merrill Lynch Futures in New York, said that though New
York dealers reported some bullion purchases, the rally
looked mostly technical to him.
   "Once the August contract for gold punched through the
$356-an-ounce level, the rally fed on itself," Mr. O'Neill
said. He said traders this week should keep their chart books
at hand because he believes the rally, if sustained, will
continue to be driven by technical forces. If current prices
hold, he suggested, commodity funds will be attracted to buy
contracts. "The market is pretty thin, so such buying could
move the market substantially," he said.
   Michael Frawley, a metals trader at PaineWebber in New
York, said the next upward resistance level for gold is $370
an ounce for the August contract. He said the contract will
find support between $350 and $352. It closed Friday at
$359.90 an ounce, up $5.80.
   The most important change in the gold market over recent
weeks, Mr. O'Neill said, is the drop in producer selling.
"That is more important than what happens to the dollar, to
interest rates or to oil prices," he said. "That is the key
for the coming week and for the summer."
   Silver, said Mr. O'Neill, is trailing gold because it
hasn't attracted any physical demand. September silver would
have to top the $5.15 to $5.20 area to demonstrate it has
technical strength, according to Mr. Frawley. The contract
closed Friday at $4.963 an ounce, up 7.1 cents.

   WASHINGTON -- Honduras paid the World Bank $152.6 million
and the International Monetary Fund about $36 million to
clear up loan arrearage at the two international agencies.
   By making the payments, Honduras regains eligibility for
new loans from the two agencies. The World Bank announced the
payment Friday, and the IMF plans to make an announcement
today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Seven countries, with about $2.9 billion in overdue loan
payments, are still on the World Bank's list of ineligible
borrowers, according to a bank official, who identified the
countries as: Nicaragua, Liberia, Panama, Peru, Sierra Leone,
Syria and Zambia.
   The IMF has a list of nine countries with overdue loan
payments totaling about $4.4 billion. That list consists of
Cambodia, Liberia, Panama, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, the
Sudan, Vietnam and Zambia.

   Tokyo's Major Index Falls, but Advancing Issues
   Outnumber Decliners; London Shares Post a Gain

   Tokyo shares finished mixed Friday, with prices declining
toward the end of the day as gains narrowed on high-priced
shares that lent the market early strength.
   London shares finished a choppy session firmer as the
successful completion of the June Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 stock-index contract was well received by the
market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 165.95 points
at 31940.24. The index lost 206.56 points Thursday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index was
down 102.74 points to 31837.50.
   On Friday, advancing issues outpaced declining ones,
524-423, with 183 unchanged, as investors showed renewed
interest in buying stocks with strong earnings predictions,
traders said. Dealings centered on small-capitalization
companies that presented favorable outlooks in recently
released consolidated earnings reports.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million
shares, up from 448 million shares Thursday. The Tokyo Stock
Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which
lost 12.00 points Thursday, was down 7.04 points, or 0.30%,
at 2343.36.
   The Second Section Index, which gained 22.85 points
Thursday, was up 22.19, or 0.53%, to close at 4200.81. Volume
in the Second Section was estimated at 27 million shares, up
from 25 million shares Thursday.
   The yen's early strength prompted buying of shares in
domestic demand-related sectors. Also helped by continuing
advances of high-priced high-technology shares, the Nikkei
index rose as high as 32342 at midmorning. But uncertainty
about the direction of domestic interest rates caused most
domestic demand-related shares to fall back in the afternoon.
   Traders said institutional investors mostly remained on
the sidelines or took profits ahead of the weekend, with the
monetary union of West and East Germany slated for Sunday.
But many others predicted that the unification move in Europe
would have little immediate impact on financial markets.
   Stocks that could benefit from increased public spending
in Japan were popular, as the Japanese government promised
Thursday at the U.S.-Japan Structural Impediment Initiative
talks a 430 trillion yen ($2.808 trillion) package of public
works spending in the next 10 years.
   Construction companies and related issues attracted buying
interest, traders said, while technology shares continued to
draw dealer-led buying, as major Japanese brokerage houses
have been setting them up as their trade focus for July.
Buying by investment trust funds also helped support these
shares, traders said.
   Fluctuating widely Friday was Sony. As a report that the
company's U.S. unit may be under congressional review for
alleged tax evasion hit the market, Sony dropped as low as
8,860 yen ($57.85) a share in midmorning. Company spokesmen
in the U.S. and in Japan categorically denied the
allegations. The stock eventually ended at 9,080, up 110.
   Among other high-tech shares, TDK advanced 50 to 7,500,
Pioneer gained 60 to 6,480, and Kyocera was up 140 at 8,890.
   In London, dealers said there was some trepidation early
in the day that the expiration of the June FT-SE 100 contract
would bring a wave of volatility to the market, but this
didn't prove to be the case.
   The bulk of the day's trading did come early, but activity
overall was moderate. At the close, the FT-SE 100-share index
was up 18.9 points at 2374.6, having reached a peak of 2384.8
a few minutes after the June contract expired. Its low point
also came in early trading, when the index was down 6.8 at
2348.9.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share industrial index
rose 12.1 to 1899.9. Volume was 461.9 million shares,
compared with 448.1 million the day before.
   Among the few corporate features in the day's trading,
Legal &amp; General rose 13 pence to 440 pence ($7.70) a share on
renewed rumors of a bid for the company coming from the
Netherlands. The speculation helped the rest of the insurance
sector, where Prudential gained 8 to 239 and General Accident
rose 16 to #11.41.
   Scottish &amp; Newcastle fell 3 to 340. The Edinburgh-based
brewer is due to report full-year earnings today. GEC, which
is due to release full-year earnings Wednesday, dropped 1 to
195.
   British Aerospace fell 11 to 534 on fears of a decline in
orders and a pessimistic outlook for defense concerns after
the U.K. government announced a total of #600 million ($1.04
billion) in cuts in its defense budget.
   Rothmans International continued to benefit from its
well-received results released Wednesday, rising 28 to 790.
However, the stock was relatively thinly traded with 884,000
shares changing hands.
   Among blue-chip stocks, Allied-Lyons rose 5 to 503, B.A.T
Industries climbed 7 to 657, Reuters strengthened 19 to
#12.60, Pearson fell 4 to 765, and Hanson fell 1 to 238.5.
   Frankfurt share prices dropped in nervous trading, as
position-squaring at the end of the quarter and before the
start of monetary union with East Germany weighed against
prices. The German Stock Index, or DAX, fell 15.27 points to
end at 1879.90.
   "There was a lot of profit-taking before the monetary
union," said Jens Wiecking, a trader at Merck, Finck &amp; Co. in
Duesseldorf. "The market's been volatile lately, and many
people figured before monetary union Sunday . . . was a good
time to take profits."
   In other European markets, share prices closed higher in
Brussels, Zurich, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid, lower in Paris
and mixed in Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed
higher.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Seoul, Manila and
Singapore, were mixed in Wellington and rose in Hong Kong,
Taipei and Sydney.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   Less than a year after buying 25% of Spain's Grupo Zeta
S.A., media owner Rupert Murdoch wants out.
   Zeta, a Spanish magazine and newspaper publisher, said it
is negotiating with various international groups interested
in acquiring a stake in Mr. Murdoch's News International PLC,
a unit of the Australia-based News Corp. Zeta holds the stake
that is for sale in News International.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Zeta gave no details about possible purchasers. But it
said Mr. Murdoch decided to sell after Zeta's chairman,
Antonio Asensio, rejected a request for News International to
be allowed to raise its stake.
   Zeta said Mr. Asensio, its founder and 70% shareholder,
had no intention of reducing his majority holding.
   "In this situation," Zeta added, "News International made
known its intention of selling its holding to obtain funds
with which to meet its liquidity requirements."

   Heard on the Street:
   Seeking Values in Troubled Banking Sector,
   Many Analysts Look to Conservative Midwest

   NEW YORK -- Investors prospecting among depressed bank
stocks might do well to bring their picks and shovels to the
Midwest.
   More than their East and West Coast brethren, Midwest
banks have skirted the unholy trio of Third World loans,
leveraged buy-out loans and bad real estate loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's not that Midwest banks have avoided these loans
entirely. But they have generally made fewer of them and kept
loan portfolios diversified so that a few bad loans can't
sour the whole barrel. Many of them also have set aside ample
reserves to cover problem loans.
   "In general, the bankers in the Midwest are a more
conservative lot," says Kenneth F. Puglisi, an analyst with
Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, a securities firm specializing in
bank stocks. As for real estate, he says, "They didn't have a
boom, so they can't have a bust."
   Midwest banks may also be able to ride the economic
comeback of the Farm Belt. Large publicly traded banks make
relatively few agricultural loans, but they still benefit
when economic activity improves in their home territories.
   Despite these advantages, stocks of Midwest banks are
almost as depressed as other bank stocks. While the average
East Coast bank stock sells for a depressed 6.5 times the
company's expected per-share earnings for next year, the
average Midwest bank stock sells for a multiple of just 7.1,
according to Keefe Bruyette.
   J. Richard Fredericks, an analyst with Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco, likes Detroit-based NBD and, to
a lesser extent, Norwest and First Bank System, both based in
Minneapolis.
   NBD, he says, is "probably the best in the country" at
avoiding bad loans.
   "NBD, which started in 1933 -- note the year -- has grown
up with a mentality to protect itself on credit quality," Mr.
Fredericks says. "It has never had a year since 1960" when
loan losses have exceeded 0.5% of loans outstanding, he says.
Less than 10% of its loan portfolio consists of real estate
construction loans or loans of more than $20 million.
   Norwest, Mr. Fredericks says, is "very healthy, very
clean." First Bank System has had problems but has changed
its management, contained costs and raised capital. "I
recommend it on a {dividend} yield basis," he says.
   More than a dozen brokerage houses are recommending Banc
One, Columbus, Ohio. Banc One has a history of product
innovation and seems to have deftly timed its entry into the
depressed Texas market. Whereas profit of $1 for each $100 of
assets is considered good for a bank, Banc One has often
managed to earn $1.40 for each $100.
   But Scott Black, president of Delphi Securities in Boston,
isn't a fan of Banc One shares; he feels the bank isn't
setting aside enough reserves for nonperforming loans. He
likes two other Midwest banks, First of America Bank in
Kalamazoo, Mich., and Manufacturers National in Detroit.
   First of America has "clean accounting," lends mainly to
small businesses and earns $1 for each $100 of assets, Mr.
Black says. Manufacturers National has a nice sideline in
helping companies with importing and exporting and is selling
for only six times this year's depressed earnings, he says.
   George Salem, an analyst with Prudential-Bache, cautions
against picking a bank just because it's in the Midwest. "I
don't think it's as simple as geography," he says. "The most
important thing is understanding the lending culture."
   Declines in real estate values still have a long way to
run, in Mr. Salem's view, even in the Midwest. "If this was a
baseball analogy, it would be the third or fourth inning," he
says, so "you need an extraconservative bank to withstand the
challenges."
   He thinks NBD fills that bill. His favorite, though, is in
Winston-Salem, N.C., not the Midwest. It's First Wachovia,
whose managers, he says, are "the high priests of prudent
lending." He isn't recommending Norwest, because of "some
overbuilding in the Twin Cities," and he rates Banc One only
a hold, he says, because of "a forecast rise in real estate
lending problems."
   Thomas H. Hanley of Salomon Brothers favors NBD and
Norwest. Both are on the bargain counter, he says. NBD's
price-earnings multiple is only about 62% of the market's
multiple, while Norwest's is only about 59%.
   Despite the operating improvements at First Bank System,
Mr. Hanley wouldn't buy the stock. "I think the company is
immune to the creation of shareholder value; it just seems
that they consistently have problems," he says. Nor would he
buy Banc One, even though its results have been good, because
it already trades at 80% of the market multiple.
   New York money manager Walter Kass of Curators Capital
Management favors First Interstate of Iowa, calling it a
financially strong bank that earns about $1.12 for each $100
of assets, mainly on home mortgage lending. And though he
likes its common, Mr. Kass thinks a better play is its
convertible bonds.

   LONDON -- Compaq Computer Corp. is setting up a network of
personal-computer dealers in East Germany and Yugoslavia, in
a campaign to establish operations in Eastern Europe.
   In an interview, Eckhard Pfeiffer, head of the
Houston-based personal-computer maker's international
division, said the company has appointed 13 private
computer-dealers in East Germany and four in Yugoslavia to
sell Compaq personal computers there. He added that he
expects to expand the East German dealer-network to 30
outlets by year-end and also plans soon to select dealers in
Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

   The expansion adds Compaq, the world's second-biggest
maker of personal computers, to the growing list of Western
computer companies establishing sales networks in Eastern
Europe. International Business Machines Corp., Digital
Equipment Corp. and West Germany's Siemens AG are also
expanding their dealer networks in the region. Spurring the
computer companies is a decision last month by Western
nations to liberalize technology trade with former East Bloc
nations.
   Mr. Pfeiffer said he can't predict Compaq sales in the
region because of the shortage of hard currency in most of
the countries. East Germany, he said, offers the best
immediate sales prospects because of the country's currency
union yesterday with West Germany.
   He added that Compaq is naming Yugoslav-born Zelimir Ilic,
its 45-year-old manager for the Middle East, Africa and some
West European countries, as sales and marketing director in
Eastern Europe.

   Dense-Pac Microsystems Inc. lowered by as much as 30% its
sales forecast for its current fiscal year ending Feb. 1991
to between $7 million and $8 million. The company cited a
slowdown in orders in its defense-related and commercial
businesses.
   "Many defense contractors are playing conservative and
waiting for (government) funding until they release orders,"
said Bill Stowell, Dense-Pac's chief financial officer.
Defense contractors account for roughly 75% of sales for
Garden Grove, Calif.-based Dense-Pac, which designs and makes
memory components used in advanced-technology systems such as
aircraft, missiles and communications equipment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though June is usually a strong month for the company, new
orders were weak last month, the company said.
   For the fiscal year ended Feb. 28, 1990, Dense-Pac posted
a net loss of $183,599, equal to five cents a share, on sales
of $7.1 million. The company didn't make a bottom-line
forecast for the current fiscal year.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- West Germany was the world's biggest
exporter during the first three months of 1990, recapturing
the lead from the U.S., the International Monetary Fund
reported.
   West Germany increased its exports to $99.8 billion, up
more than 18% from the year earlier. The U.S. increase of
almost 10% brought its total to $97.2 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1989, the U.S. regained first place with $364 billion
of exports compared with West Germany's $341 billion. West
Germany first forged ahead in 1986.
   Experts say the economic unification of West Germany and
East Germany, which officially began yesterday, could put the
united Germany ahead of the U.S. as the world's biggest
exporter for years to come. The IMF didn't give any figures
for East Germany, which isn't among its 151 member countries.
   Japan trailed in a distant third place with $274 billion
of exports for 1989 and $68 billion for this year's first
quarter.
   The U.S. remained by far the world's biggest importer,
bringing in $125 billion in foreign-made goods in the first
quarter, up from $118 billion a year earlier. West Germany's
imports also increased, to $78 billion from $65 billion.
   Japan, striving to reduce complaints about its big export
surplus, was the only one of the seven major industrial
countries to report a drop in exports for the quarter. Japan
still had a $12 billion surplus for the period, second only
to West Germany's.

   Personnel Managers Meet With Changes
   ---
   Turbulence of Past Decade Is
   Evident in Topics, Services

   ATLANTA -- Signs of the past decade's turbulence were
evident everywhere as about 4,000 of the country's personnel
managers gathered here last week.
   Vendors of services that scarcely existed when the 1980s
began dominated the exhibit hall: Outplacement firms to ease
unwanted managers on to other careers; drug-testing concerns
to ensure a narcotic-free workplace. Some services vow to
catch workplace criminals; others, to attack spiraling
health-care costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Workshop topics at the meeting, the annual convention of
the Society for Human Resource Management, betrayed the pace
of change: Illiteracy in the workplace. Sex. Drugs. AIDS.
"How many people here have been involved in mergers,
acquisitions, rapid growth or reductions in force, corporate
relocation or a plant closing?" asks Jackie Greaner, an
Atlanta consultant. Almost all the 80 or so people attending
her session raise their hands.
   When she asked the question at a similar gathering eight
years ago, Ms. Greaner says, fewer than 10% of attendees said
yes. "Who here knows what business as usual is?" she asks. No
one raises a hand. To her, the answers signal the end of an
era of predictability.
   There are, says Jeffrey J. Hallett, a Falls Church,
Va.-based consultant, "no rules, no institutions, no
behaviors, no experiences and no definitions" that can be
counted on to last through the next decade. During the 1990s,
he predicts: "Confusion and turbulence will be worse, not
better" as companies struggle to cope with technology,
globalization, changing demography and a changing work force.
   One result is a kind of revisionism.
   During the 1980s, many mourned the death of corporate
loyalty, lost to the ravages of cutbacks and downsizing.
Today, however, some experts contend that corporate loyalty
wasn't all it was cracked up to be but actually downright bad
for companies and workers alike.
   The word for the 1990s, they say, is "commitment."
   The difference between loyalty and commitment, says Ms.
Greaner, is that commitment is "more conscious. Corporate
loyalty isn't necessarily a healthy attitude. Loyalty means
don't miss time off the job, don't call in sick. It's
passive. You can be loyal, but not actively participate in
your company."
   Agrees consultant Joseph L. Mancusi: Loyalty is "based on
the presumption you will be taken care of. Corporations or
managers or people on welfare -- they are equal if they feel
they are going to be taken care of."
   What's more, experts contend that commitment can be
created. "Even if you aren't committed to your organization
any more, you can help people find other sources of
commitment that make them excited," says Ms. Greaner.
"Commitment isn't all or nothing," she says. "You can be
committed to your boss, your job, to your customers."
   "We are recycling the '60s in the '90s," says Mr. Mancusi.
"People are finding external things to be committed to."
   Most chief executive officers have said -- at least once
in their careers -- that "people are our most valuable
assets."
   Mr. Hallett wishes they meant it. With a shrinking work
force and declining skills level, he contends that a stable
and trained work force is as much a critical investment as
plants and machinery. But conventional accounting doesn't
take people into account, except as costs.
   "Human resource people and the bean counters have to get
together to figure out a new set of generally accepted
accounting principles to get human relations on the balance
sheet," he tells one session. "We have to figure out how to
account for human relations so we can value investment in
people. Until we get {people} on the balance sheet, no one
will take it seriously," he says.
   "It's true," says Gary Stagner, director of human
resources for Partners National Health Plan, a health
maintainance organization in Irving, Texas. "I come out of a
service industry, and people are our only product."
   Others have personal reasons for agreeing: "If you could
value your contribution, it would make you more valuable to
the organization," says James Wells, an associate vice
chancellor who handles personnel matters for University of
Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, Mass.
   Mr. Hallett contends the idea isn't so far-fetched, noting
that at the turn of the century, there wasn't any recognized
method for accounting for inventory, or for work in progress.
   If companies hope to keep unions at bay, one speaker
warned the personnel managers, they had better wise up -- and
treat their employees a lot less nicely.
   The conventional wisdom, of course, is that companies are
ripe targets for unionization if they don't pay their workers
well. But Daniel C. Stone, an anti-union strategy consultant,
suggests that some workers are susceptible to union overtures
because they're paid too generously. That, he contends, can
lead to boredom and complacency -- issues he says a union can
capitalize on.
   "I usually find something I can sink my teeth in --
management styles, lack of communication, a bully supervisor,
whatever," he says. "I've been involved in a couple of
campaigns this year and the issue was boredom. It's
incredible."
   Mr. Stone says he recently faulted executives at one
company that hired him, which he didn't identify, for
"overpaying" employees. He had unkind words for the
employees, as well.
   He said employees "take all those liberal benefits that
you pay them and they'll complain about it and they'll say
this is a lousy place to work for. But they're there every
pay day with their little hand out and they make a fist as
they grab their pay check and go off to the bank."
   Every banner, sign and meeting badge featured the
society's new logo: a distinctive "HR" in white letters, set
within a dark box. To one convention-goer, however, the logo
isn't distinct enough.
   Robin Inwald recently filed a petition with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark office, seeking to cancel the logo
registration issued to the society in February. That design,
she argues, is "confusingly similar" to a logo used since
1980 by Hilson Research Inc., the psychological testing
company she owns in Kew Gardens, N.Y.
   Ms. Inwald contends that the society obtained its
registration fraudulently, since it knew about her logo from
advertisements she bought in its monthly magazine and from
exhibit booths she has rented at its conventions. If the
society continues using its new logo, she fears, potential
clients may believe her company and the society are one --
resulting in what she says could be "irreperable damage" and
"great injury" to her company.
   Catherine D. Bower, the society's vice president for
communications, denies the association stole the idea for its
logo from Hilson Research. She says "meticulous research"
preceded adoption of the design last year, part of a $30,000
image overhaul from the group's previous identity as the
American Society for Personnel Administration. Ms. Bower
believes differences between the logos -- the society's is
boxed, for instance -- minimize the likelihood of confusion,
and she says there are no plans to apologize to Ms. Inwald --
or to reconsider the decision.

   Swatch Says It's Time
   To Reach Older Crowd

<TEXT>
   EVER SINCE SWATCH introduced its colorful watches in the
U.S. eight years ago, they've been a favorite of trendy
teens. Many people older than 16, however, found them simply
cheap and plastic.
   Swatch is aiming to change that perception. The Swiss
company is rolling out new models to attract more grown-ups.
The company also plans to boost U.S. ad spending 25% next
year and announce in August a new ad agency for its
world-wide account, estimated at $35 million.
   "They're moving into this decade with the knowledge that
they aren't a trend anymore, so they have to be brand," says
Nat Whitten, a principal at Weiss, Whitten Inc., Swatch's
interim U.S. ad agency.
   The light-hearted watches virtually created a market for
fashion timepieces in the early '80s. But the U.S. boom came
just as Swatch's rapid global expansion caused product
shortages. U.S. sales peaked at five million units in 1986,
and totaled four million last year.
   To get sales moving again, Swatch is introducing a $45
scuba watch, guaranteed to keep ticking at depths of 600
feet. Later this year, the company will launch a $75
chronograph watch, twice the price of a classic Swatch.
   "We want to add upscale products, and respond to different
demands of the market," says Raymond Zeitoun, president of
SMH (US) Inc., Swatch's U.S. parent. The company has also
boosted world-wide production capacity 15%, to about 16
million watches annually.
   Even those changes may not allow the company to double its
unit sales in the next few years -- Mr. Zeitoun's goal. The
U.S. market for inexpensive watches is flat, and competition
is fierce. "Companies make these kinds of changes during
tough times," says C. Michael Jacobi, vice president of
marketing at Timex Corp. "The watch industry is still
searching for what's next."
                                                                                                       

   Egging On Consumers
   To Eat Spam in the A.M.
                                                                                                       

   IT MAY NOT SOUND like a breakfast of champions. But George
A. Hormel Co. of Austin, Minn., says plenty of aficionados of
its Spam brand of canned meat like to fry up a few slices to
eat with their eggs.
   To encourage that habit, the company is rolling out Spam
Breakfast Strips, a refrigerated product that tastes like
Spam but looks like bacon. By putting the newly shaped Spam
near bacon in the refrigerator case, the company hopes
consumers will more readily see that Spam has 50% less fat
than bacon. A World War II staple, Spam still accounts for
about 75% of the $170 million market for canned lunch meats.
   Other makers of breakfast meats are trying to rouse new
interest in their products, too. Swift Eckrich Inc., Downers
Grove, Ill., has begun selling in airports and convenience
stores a wiener-sized version of its Swift Premium Brown 'N
Serve sausage links.
   Called Sausage Sensation, the pre-cooked product is
designed to be warmed on roller grills beside hot dogs and
eaten in a bun.
   "The problem with any established brand is that people
don't see it anymore," says Patrick Riley, Swift's director
of marketing for breakfast meats. "You have to get people to
pay attention again."
   Morning meats have been in a slump for years, with health
concerns turning off some consumers, and fast-food giants
like McDonald's stealing others. "You wouldn't want to
incorporate {Sausage Sensation} in your diet for health
reasons," says Mr. Riley. "It's just supposed to be fun."
                                                                                                       

   Dessert Ex Machina:
   A Marketing Miracle?
                                                                                                       

   AT LAST, a snack machine that doesn't steal quarters.
   Nabisco Brands is testing an automatic, in-store sampling
machine that dispenses free, tiny packages of new products to
shoppers who pull a lever.
   The RJR Nabisco Inc. subsidiary is hoping the machines,
installed in 10 ShopRite grocery stores in New Jersey, will
be a more effective way to woo potential fans. Sampling is
usually accomplished by mailings, or with product
demonstrators. But most sampling programs last only a few
days, so Nabisco estimates they reach only about 15% of
shoppers. The machines can be restocked and left in stores
for weeks.
   Developed by Econo-Pak Inc. of Sussex, N.J., the sample
machines cost about $600. Dispensing only every 30 seconds,
the machines are designed to discourage the greedy.
   Sales of the crackers being sampled have more than doubled
in stores with machines, according to Allan Falvey, director
of consumer promotions at Nabisco. Coupons attached to the
samples are redeemed at about three times the rate of coupons
delivered through other avenues. "It works because it's
something different," Mr. Falvey says.
   Don't expect stores to fill up with gizmos. Some sampling
specialists say such devices would be effective only for
names as familiar as Nabisco. And because the machines must
be restocked, they would be practical only for companies that
deliver their products to stores, rather than ship through
warehouses. "It's a gimmick," says an executive at a large
sampling company.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   BLUE CONTINUES to be the top choice for ties, according to
a survey by retailer Tie Rack U.S. And red was voted the
color for "power ties" of the 1990s, pushing aside yellow. .
. . When it comes to that most unforgiving item of clothing
-- the bathing suit -- most women are playing it safe this
summer, according to NPD Group, a market research firm. Some
70% of suits sold so far this year have been one-piece
numbers.

   TOKYO -- Japan's wholesale prices in the second 10 days of
June inched up 0.1% from the previous 10 days and rose 0.9%
from a year earlier, because of the yen's decline, the Bank
of Japan, the central bank, said.
   The wholesale price index, in which the year 1985 is equal
to 100, stood at 90.5 in the latest period. Though domestic
prices remained flat from the preceding 10 days, central bank
officials said, export and import prices rose, as a result of
the Japanese currency's depreciation, and pushed up the
overall price level.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Television:
   New Sitcom With Old Soul

   Martin Tupper is a thirtyish New York City book editor
about to plunge into the single life. This is a man of many
worries: His wife is deserting him for another man, his
11-year-old son's affections also are drifting, and then,
there are the terrors of the modern dating scene.
   All this is the premise of a new comic series called, for
no very good reason, "Dream On," beginning on HBO on Sunday,
July 8, 10-10:30 p.m. EDT, and continuing on subsequent
Sundays. If the scenes described above seem familiar and
sitcom-like, it is because they are. Still, this 14-part
series, produced by John Landis (director of "Trading
Places," "Coming to America," "The Blues Brothers"), has
something more on its mind than you can find in the usual
sitcom about the newly single.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What it has, mainly, is its aspiration, which is to
emulate the style of Dennis Potter's British miniseries "The
Singing Detective." That densely psychological life story of
a writer, which aired here on PBS in 1988, was perhaps the
most remarkable dramatic work ever undertaken for television,
in which past and present were continually merged and
characters broke into song at the oddest -- the darkest --
moments.
   Taking a cue from "The Singing Detective" -- to which it
bears, otherwise, not the slightest resemblance -- "Dream On"
fuses past and present, in this case with clips of old movies
and television. The one consistently interesting thing about
the series is the way the old footage is used. Still more
interesting is what it stands for: the values of the '40s and
'50s.
   The first episode introduces Brian Benben as the
distinctly nerdlike Martin Tupper. Give a male character a
name like Tupper, and have him portrayed by an actor who
happens to look a lot like Chevy Chase, as Mr. Benben does,
and already that character has been defined in a way from
which there is no return. It does not help that both Tupper's
circle of friends and his employees consist entirely of
people who browbeat him -- not least his vituperative
secretary.
   Tupper tries, with notable lack of success, to woo his
wife back. Rejected, he escapes, in fantasy, to the balm of
the old movies -- a time of high romance, when faithful love
was always rewarded in the end and errant lovers always
returned. Even as Tupper's wife is coldly telling him no
dice, his mind is rerunning an old movie clip starring Anne
Baxter as a faithless wretch, pleading for love from the man
she once abandoned. In another scene, Tupper plies his wife
with her favorite candy, along with some cornball mementoes
of their past -- all to no avail: The woman wants a divorce.
In response, the projector in his head flashes to another old
movie: a heroically handsome Zachary Scott looks
penetratingly into the eyes of his beloved and says, "Thank
you -- for being my wife."
   It is an irresistible moment. Still, this sort of thing
entails risks, given the shattering nature of the comparisons
a viewer is presented with here. One minute we are watching
Tupper wearing a funny hat and spitting candy out of his
mouth, the next we are watching Zachary Scott pouring
champagne for his glamorous blond wife. It is a comparison,
of course, that the maker of this series intended, but there
are other differences that stand out with a fearful clarity:
The difference in characterization, for example. The vapidity
of the dialogue between Tupper and his wife, heard hard on
the heels of the old-movie eloquence, yields the sort of
contrast the makers of "Dream On" cannot have intended.
   Still, there are aspects of this series that are sharp,
that bespeak a kind of knowingness and even some vision. On
the rebound, Tupper tries dating and finds himself revolted
at the range of possibilities available to him: ladies with
kinky sexual tastes -- one requires, for her satisfaction, a
lover who will lick whipped cream from her body; another
spends the first date briefing Tupper on her understandably
long history of rejection at the hands of the opposite sex.
Still another cannot understand why the discovery that she
has a husband should make any difference to Tupper.
   With these sorts of ladies, Tupper can be decisive, even
if he does take his time about it. Midway though his effort
to lap the whipped cream off various body parts, Tupper stops
dead. Undaunted, or perhaps inspired by, the gobs of cream in
his mouth, he bolts. He clearly has had a sudden realization,
an epiphany of sorts. Yes, he's left his partner unfulfilled,
but then epiphanies in the bedroom never come without cost.
   Tupper also dispatches the married lady. From all of this,
it would appear that the milquetoast Tupper is soon to be
revealed as a man of parts, discriminating enough to be
appalled by certain aspects of contemporary life and tastes,
however much others may, so to speak, lap them up. But that
is the case only fitfully: for this is a work subverted by
one of the most insidious of those contemporary tastes,
namely the wish to have things both ways. The creators of
this series clearly wanted to cast a critical eye at manners
and morals, to compare past with present, via the old film
clips, to be satiric. In the end, or to be precise, in the
middle, they back away from hard looks to a kind of sheepish
comedy about a man accommodating to new standards of
behavior.
   Tupper is at first shocked when, in the second episode,
his friend, a Geraldo-like talk-show host, introduces him to
the two teeny-boppers who are their dates for the evening.
What is he going to do with a girl too young to be served
liquor, Tupper wants to know? Tupper resists her, but not for
long, especially after he discovers the teeny-bopper
appreciates him as a person, as the saying goes. This makes
everything swell and so, as shadows draw nigh and evening is
near, Tupper ushers the girl up to his apartment, with manful
ease. We are now, of course, far from satire and well into a
story of "growth" and of the overcoming of hurdles -- the
sort of twaddle with which television writers are always
comfortable. The hurdles Tupper has managed to overcome may
be his scruples, but hey, progress is progress.
   Later in the series, "Dream On" takes a tentative swipe or
two more at new cultural values. In an episode entitled "Sex
and the Single Father," Tupper is horrified to discover that
his 11-year-old son knows about all the essentials of sex --
but that he requires more detailed information about advanced
technicalities for pleasuring women and also what his father
does for fun when he's alone. With each question the boy
throws at his father, we see an old clip of a boxing movie
with Lee Marvin taking repeated shots to the jaw. Again and
again we see this punch, an ironic emblem for this series,
which, despite estimable intentions, ends up pulling its
punches.

   N.V. Philips is preparing to announce the elimination of
at least several hundred more jobs in its computer division,
sources close to the company said.
   The Dutch electronics company, which in June announced
plans to cut 210 computer-related jobs in the Netherlands,
plans further reductions at plants in France, Sweden and
Canada, the sources said.
</LP>

   In addition, Jan Timmer, Philips's new chairman, is likely
to sketch plans for broader cost-saving measures when he
assumes his new post this week.
   In the computer division, which has had losses estimated
at more than 100 million guilders ($53 million) a quarter in
the past year, Philips apparently aims to improve performance
enough to attract potential partners or buyers for parts of
the business.
   An extraordinary meeting today is expected to draw about
1,000 shareholders, a Philips spokesman said.

   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Go-Video Inc. said it received the
first shipments of its long-awaited dual-deck videocassette
recorders from the manufacturer, Samsung Electronics Co. of
South Korea.
   Go-Video has received purchase orders for 30,000 of the
VCRs from its distributor, D&amp;H Distributing Co., Harrisburg,
Pa. Go-Video expects to fill those orders before the end of
the year, said R. Terren Dunlap, chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dual-deck VCRs, which allow viewers to duplicate tapes
or play one while recording another, will retail at stores in
the Northwest, mid-Atlantic and Arizona, including Sharper
Image and Hammacher Schlemmer. At Hammacher Schlemmer, the
VCR will retail for $1,295 and have a five-year warranty.
   Go-Video acquired the technology for its VCR by taking a
group of Asian electronics companies to court two years ago,
charging that they refused to sell it the technology to make
the decks. Samsung was dismissed as a defendant in that case
after it agreed to make Go-Video's patented dual-deck
recorder. Litigation in that case is continuing against
several other manufacturers, and Go-Video filed a second suit
against the companies in January, alleging that they have
monopolized the entire consumer-electronics business. The
defendants include Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and its
Panasonic unit, Victor Co. and its U.S. JVC Corp. unit, Sony
Corp., NEC Corp., Sharp Corp. and Sanyo Electric Co.

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan said it agreed
to acquire a 25.1% equity stake in Loewe Opta G.m.b.H., a
West German maker of consumer electronic products. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   "By becoming a partner with Loewe, Matsushita would like
to form an industrial partnership with the German company
involving a joint development of digital TV and other areas
of color TV production," said Tadakazu Yamamoto, a Matsushita
managing director in charge of the company's color television
sector.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Matsushita officials said acquiring the Loewe stake is
part of Matsushita's program to increase its overseas
production to 50% of its entire business outside Japan by
1993. Matsushita already operates 18 overseas plants in 15
countries for TV production; it makes TV sets in Britain.
   Loewe, established in 1923 and capitalized at 45 million
marks ($26.9 million), makes color TV sets, car electronic
equipment and telecommunications products. It has about 1,500
employees and had 1989 sales of 300 million marks, Matsushita
officials said.

   WASHINGTON -- Peru is trying to mend its relations with
the international financial community.
   President-elect Alberto Fujimori met Friday in New York
with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel
Camdessus, World Bank President Barber Conable and the
president of the Inter-America Development Bank, Enrique
Iglesias, to discuss normalizing relations with these
agencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Fujimori, at the meetings, outlined an economic
austerity plan that he intends to implement when he takes
office at the end of this month. It includes tax increases
and other revenue-boosting measures.
   The meetings were arranged by Javier Perez de Cuellar,
secretary general of the United Nations.
   Peru is more than $2 billion in arrears to international
agencies and has several billion dollars of unresolved
arrears with commercial banks. This includes about $850
million owed to the IMF, $720 million owed to the World Bank
and about $450 million owed to the IADB.
   Several months ago, Peru started normalizing its relations
with the IMF by resuming payments on its debt to the agency
but leaving its existing arrears unresolved. It has yet to
make such agreements with the World Bank and IADB and, since
1987, it generally has been at loggerheads with all of its
creditors.

   TOKYO -- Japan's demand for one-megabit dynamic random

   Demand for a variety of semiconductors, which languished

   General Signal Corp. said it decided not to sell its

business had been inadequate.
   The Stamford, Conn., maker of semiconductors and
electrical equipment said the group's results exceeded
expectations for the first five months of 1990, and that it
expects sales of approximately $150 million for the full
year.

   General Signal had announced in March its intent to sell
the group, consisting of three units that supply
telecommunications test equipment, transmission and network
products. Instead, a spokesman said, "earnings are worth more
to us than the proceeds we would receive to pay down debt."
General Signal said at the time it intended to use proceeds
of the telecommunications sale to pay down debt.
   In a separate announcement, General Signal said it will
shed two unprofitable units in its technology group, namely
semiconductor systems and thin film processing.
   General Signal reported earnings for 1989 of $78.5
million, on sales of $1.92 billion.

   Charge of $247 Million Is Set
   Against Year's Earnings
   In Continuation of Cuts

   Campbell Soup Co., extending the restructuring program it
started in August 1989, said it will sell several North
American businesses and close three plants.
   In connection with the latest moves, the food company will
take a charge of $247 million, or about $1.90 a share,
against earnings for the fiscal year ending July 29.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   David W. Johnson, president and chief executive officer,
said the asset sales and plant closures represent the end of
the rapid cost-cutting necessary to boost Campbell's
profitability. "The tough but necessary decision-making is
over," Mr. Johnson said. "We are now released to go forward."
   When combined with charges for the sale of some European
operations, announced last month, Campbell will take a hit of
$302 million, or $2.33 a share, in fiscal 1990, probably
wiping out most of Campbell's earnings for the second
consecutive year. In fiscal 1989, net income was $13.1
million, or 10 cents a share, including a charge of $261
million, or $2.02 a share, for the restructuring begun last
summer by Mr. Johnson's predecessor, R. Gordon McGovern.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Campbell shares rose 75 cents to $57.25.
   Mr. McGovern, whose plan included closing about nine
plants world-wide, resigned abruptly in November, even as
some members of Campbell's controlling Dorrance family were
growing dissatisfied with the company's financial
performance.
   When Mr. Johnson arrived from Gerber Products Co. in
January, he continued Mr. McGovern's program and began to
re-evaluate all of Campbell's operations. In May, he laid off
14% of the staff at company headquarters in Camden, N.J., and
put up for sale the company's Italian cookie company and
British frozen vegetable and seafood operations.
   The latest businesses to be hoisted onto the auction block
have total annual sales of more than $300 million and include
most of Campbell's fresh and refrigerated products, notably
mushrooms, Domsea Farms seafood, and Marie's salad dressings.
Also up for sale are a frozen poultry operation in Sumter,
S.C., and a Scottish chilled-food plant. In fiscal 1989 total
sales were $5.67 billion.
   Campbell is closing plants in Fremont, Neb., and Grand
Prairie, Texas, and an equipment center in Moorestown, N.J.
About 341 employees will lose their jobs.
   Industry analysts expressed surprise at the magnitude of
the charge but hailed the decision as the latest example of
Mr. Johnson's commitment to improving Campbell's earnings
growth and return on equity, which have ranked near the
bottom of the industry for the past decade.
   "They're selling the junk here," said John McMillin, an
analyst with PrudentialBache Research. "They just didn't have
the scale or the size in refrigerated foods to make money."
   The auctioning of the U.S. fresh and refrigerated foods
businesses and the international divestitures demonstrate
just how much of a break Mr. Johnson would like to make with
the past. Both areas were of special interest to Mr.
McGovern, who sought to make Campbell a global food giant.
"Gordon's dream was to go where the volume growth is," Mr.
McMillin said. "It's Johnson's dream to make money."
   One reason behind the latest round of asset sales is Mr.
Johnson's need to placate a dissident group of Dorrance
shareholders that is seeking a sale of the company. "We're
going to show that this team of professional management is
the preferred and best management of Campbell Soup Co.
assets," Mr. Johnson said.

   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Legislature approved an
interstate banking bill that will allow banks outside of New
England to open or buy banks in the state.
   Until now, only banks based in other New England states
have been able to enter the Massachusetts market.
</LP>

   The bill will permit interstate banking 60 days after its
expected signing by the governor. However, a bank can choose
to opt out of the interstate banking provisions until July 1,
1992, by a two-thirds vote of its directors.
   Analysts don't expect the legislation to result in a
flurry of bank takeovers, largely because many of the state's
banks are struggling under the real estate and general
economic slump and thus aren't considered attractive targets
for outsiders.

   Japan Air Lines Co. said its consolidated pretax profits
rose 15% to 59.01 billion yen ($385.7 million) in the fiscal
year ended March 31 from 51.35 billion yen the year earlier.
   Net income, however, fell 12% to 17.68 billion yen from
20.18 billion yen. Per-share net fell to 107.50 yen from
129.05 yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenues climbed 15% to 1.255 trillion yen from 1.092
trillion yen. JAL said revenues were boosted by the
continuing strength of Japan's economy and the increasing
trend among Japanese to travel abroad.
   The company cited a fall in extraordinary profits from
sales of fixed assets and an increase in corporate tax
reserves as reasons for the fall in profits.
   For the current fiscal year, JAL sees pretax profits
edging up to 60 billion yen while net income is expected to
recover to 23.5 billion yen. Revenues are expected to rise to
1.305 trillion yen.

   BUENOS AIRES -- Bell Atlantic Corp. of Philadelphia and
Telefonica S.A. of Spain were awarded a combined 60% share in
Argentina's state telephone company, Empresa Nacional de
Telecommunicaciones, or Entel, under a privatization plan.
   President Carlos Menem signed the decree, saying the two
companies' bids were the highest when bids were opened last
week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A formal takeover is scheduled for Oct. 8. Before then,
30% of the new company will be offered to investors and the
remaining 10% given to employees.
   Bell Atlantic, a regional telecommunications company, and
Telefonica, the Spanish state monopoly, paid a combined $214
million in cash and $5 billion in debt papers for Entel,
which has 3.2 million phone lines and 45,000 employees.
   The two companies pledged to pay an additional $379
million more within six years, and to invest several hundred
million dollars in the new enterprise.
   "This is a moment of triumph," said President Menem, who
has made privatizations the centerpiece of his efforts to
introduce free-market revisions to Argentina's
state-dominated economy.

   In Acquisition

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC)
</GV>
<LP>
   The Federal Trade Commission took a step toward blocking
the $220 million acquisition of certain assets of Union
Carbide Corp. by Arco Chemical Co., but the companies said
they believe they can still resolve antitrust issues.
   Resolving those issues may be particularly important to
Arco Chemical, because it has already made full payment to
Carbide. And, according to both companies, the payment is
nonrefundable under the terms of their agreement, reached
last September. The companies added that if the deal doesn't
go through, Arco Chemical has rights to the proceeds from a
subsequent sale of the assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The step taken by the FTC was to authorize its staff to
seek a preliminary injunction rescinding Arco Chemical's
purchase of Carbide's urethane polyols and propylene glycol
businesses. Urethane polyols are the main raw material for
polyurethane, which is used in foam cushions and packaging.
Propylene glycol is used in products including fiberglass,
paints and cosmetics.
   The FTC said it was seeking a recision, as opposed to a
barring of the transaction, because it "had reason to believe
that beneficial ownership" of Carbide's assets had already
passed to Arco Chemical. Marc Schildkraut, an FTC staff
member, declined to say exactly what constitutes beneficial
ownership in the view of the commission. But he acknowledged
that the up-front payment by Arco Chemical is part of the
issue.
   "An up-front payment is unusual," said Mr. Schildkraut.
Asked whether the payment could be returned to Arco Chemical
by court order, he said, "That's something that will be up to
the judge." The companies haven't commented on the reasons
for the terms of the agreement.
   The FTC also alleged that the companies failed to make
timely premerger notification filings to antitrust agencies.
The commission didn't go into specifics, and the companies
denied the charge.
   A spokesman for Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn., said it
continues to operate the businesses in question and to
collect the revenue from them. Upon closing of the sale, he
said, Carbide is to pay Arco Chemical any "surplus cash flow"
accumulated during this interim period, and Arco Chemical is
to compensate Carbide for any "negative cash flow."
   Carbide has already accounted for the up-front payment,
having taken in the 1989 third quarter a gain to earnings of
about $62 million.
   Arco Chemical, based in Newtown Square, Pa., said in a
statement that it is still negotiating with the FTC's staff
and that the commission's action "was intended only to
authorize litigation in the event the matter cannot otherwise
be resolved."
   All the parties to the negotiations declined to specify
the antitrust issues.
   Arco Chemical added that it is confident the courts will
allow the acquisition to proceed if the FTC's action results
in litigation.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Arco
Chemical closed at $40.75, unchanged. The company is
83%-owned by Atlantic Richfield Co., Los Angeles. Carbide
shares closed on the Big Board at $19.25, down 12.5 cents
apiece.

   PITTSBURGH -- A foundation here plans to donate 100,000
acres of historic and ecologically sensitive land to the
federal government in what appears to be the largest such
gift ever.
   The land, which was acquired over the past two years for
$21 million, includes a 93,000-acre wildlife refuge in North
Carolina and the so-called "Cornfield" at Antietam National
Battlefield in Maryland, site of one of the bloodiest Civil
War battles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The gift by the Richard King Mellon Foundation is a rare
show of environmental philanthropy. Only 3.6% of all
foundation grant money goes to the environment, according to
the Foundation Center in New York, which tracks foundation
grants.
   The Mellon Foundation, a leader in environmental
philanthropy, purchased the properties through The
Conservation Fund, an Arlington, Va.-based non-profit group.
The fund selected the land from a government list of
ecological and historical properties, many of which were
threatened by commercial development. The conservation
organization benefited from a sluggish real estate market,
but often found itself competing with land developers.
   The fund, for example, paid $8.8 million for the
93,000-acre wildlife refuge in Alligator River, N.C.,
outbidding a group of Japanese investors who wanted to mine
the land.

   PARIS -- By replacing aging Chairman Gustave Leven, Source
Perrier S.A. begins a search for more vigorous leadership
amid lingering sales problems caused by this year's benzene
contamination incident.
   Mr. Leven, 76 years old, built his once-sleepy water
company into an international marketing force. But the
idiosyncratic chairman failed to groom a strong successor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With sales recovering only slowly after Perrier recalled
its green bottles in February from stores and restaurants
world-wide, the company's main shareholders decided to take
action.
   The new chairman is Jacques Vincent, who heads Perrier's
main shareholder, investment group Exor S.A., and who until
now was Perrier's vice chairman. But Mr. Vincent, 66 years
old, is expected to be an interim chairman. His job is to
find a longer-term professional manager, something Mr. Leven
apparently hadn't done to Exor's satisfaction.
   Mr. Vincent's accession quieted rumors that Perrier might
be put on the block or become a takeover target, although it
didn't put the talk entirely to rest. Exor controls around
35% of Perrier shares and the sometimes divided Leven family
controls about 18% more.

   First City's Abboud Gets His First Taste
   Of the Familiar Woes of Texas Banking
   ----

<LP>
   At last A. Robert Abboud can truly call himself a Texas
banker.
   After two years of broadcasting nothing but good news from
First City Bancorp. of Texas, the Houston bank holding
company he helped rescue in 1988, the former Chicagoan
suddenly finds himself grappling with troubles all too
familiar to natives of the Lone Star state. Rising problem
loans. Falling profits. And, above all, skepticism on Wall
Street.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Their near-term picture is spotty and deserves a lot of
scrutiny," says James J. McDermott Jr., a banking analyst
with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., who calls recent trends
"alarming."
   Mr. Abboud didn't do much to calm such worries when he
disclosed that he expects First City's second-quarter profit
to fall to 75 cents to 95 cents a share from $1.08 a year
earlier -- the first such decline since he took the helm in
April 1988. Worse, he said that nonperforming assets,
including several questionable credits to such debt-laden
outfits as Circle K Corp., were likely to jump to $200
million, 43% above the year-end total. The news drove First
City stock down two points in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Friday. The stock closed at $26.25 a share,
a new 52-week low.
   Of course, bad news isn't exactly a rare commodity in the
banking world these days. Across the country, credit quality
fears and dwindling interest margins are depressing bank
stocks and forcing painful personnel changes.
   But until lately, Mr. Abboud and First City had seemed
almost bullet-proof. For starters, the deal the banker
structured to take over First City two years ago cleansed the
books of most problems, including sour real estate loans and
Third World credits, and brought in nearly $1.5 billion in
federal aid and private equity. That enabled him to start
lending again while most of his Texas competitors were still
mired in workouts.
   What's more, the feisty 61-year-old brought with him a
carefully cultivated image as a tight-fisted lender. In the
late 1970s, as chairman and chief executive of First Chicago
Corp., Mr. Abboud braved fierce criticism from the local
business community by slamming the brakes on loan growth.
Although many now credit him with preventing the bank from
following crosstown rival Continental Illinois Corp. into
collapse, at the time his actions helped get him fired. "It
was a little like trying to persuade hedonists to forgo
earthly pleasures and wait for their reward in the
hereafter," Mr. Abboud wrote in his autobiography, "Money in
the Bank."
   But now some in the industry are wondering if Mr. Abboud
hasn't succumbed to the siren call of quick profits. Last
year, First City's loans rose 15% to $8.22 billion, a
blistering pace considering the spotty nature of Texas's
economic recovery, and much faster than deposit growth.
   By contrast, total lending by all Texas banks shrank
during the period. "Finding quality loans is quite
difficult," says Ronald G. Steinhart, chairman of Fort Worth,
Texas-based Team Bank, which was also resurrected with
federal aid. "We don't see {First City} doing crazy things,
but we see them being the most aggressive" lenders.
   Some of First City's early credit decisions are coming
back to haunt it. Since the beginning of the year, four major
out-of-state borrowers that owe the bank a collective $72.5
million have trooped into federal bankruptcy court: Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.; Circle K, the convenience store chain;
Federated Department Stores Inc.; and Garfinckel's Inc., a
department-store chain owned by Mr. Abboud's longtime friend
Wafic Said.
   "It seems to be the same story we so frequently see in
banking," says Sandra Flannigan, an analyst with Alex. Brown
&amp; Sons, Baltimore. "Any time a bank grows its loan portfolio
at a pace far greater than the expansion of loan demand
within the region, it's often followed by problems and losses
in the portfolio."
   Not surprisingly, that isn't the way Mr. Abboud sees it.
"I certainly hope I haven't lost my reputation as a
conservative lender, because I consider myself one," he says.
He acknowledges that First City has moved to tighten credit
policies this year, particularly in the wholesale lending
department, which participates in large national credits such
as leveraged buy-outs. The bank is also trying to direct more
loans to the Texas market, which Mr. Abboud believes is
poised to take off.
   But he denies that First City has made a habit of
extending risky loans. If the bank has cut some deals others
weren't comfortable with, that might be because the credits
involved particularly complex financial arrangements, he
says, not because they were unwise.
   The Garfinckel's loan, he says, is a case in point.
Although the company has filed for bankruptcy-court
protection from creditors, First City hasn't even felt
obliged to place the credit on nonperforming status. Of the
initial $21 million Garfinckel's owed, First City has already
received a $7.5 million cash paydown. A revolving credit
facility of $3.8 million is secured by customer receivables
of nearly twice that amount, and the remainder of the loan is
secured both by the store's assets and by a contract that
would allow the bank to "put" the credit to a third party,
Mr. Abboud says.
   First City also says it is confident it will win full
repayment on the Drexel, Circle K and Federated facilities.
"I'm comfortable that {nonperformers} are flattened out," Mr.
Abboud says. He also points out that nonperformers remain a
relatively low 1.4% of total assets and that the bank's
capital position is quite strong.
   And if there are a few more rough spots along the way, Mr.
Abboud doesn't seem worried. Indeed, with the sort of
contrarianism that has long confounded friends and foes
alike, Mr. Abboud vows to continue pushing First City into
areas other banks have shied from, such as international
trade finance.
   He even says he might try to capitalize on First City's
recent troubles by marketing its expertise in managing
difficult loans to other banks. "We know how to work out of
problems," he says. "I think that's a very valuable resource
at this particular time."

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Tesoro Petroleum Corp. said it will
pay the government of Trinidad and Tobago $2.8 million to
settle litigation related to a now-defunct oil exploration
and production venture.
   The Trinidad and Tobago government, in a lawsuit filed
last year, sought unspecified damages and the return of $350
million in profits it said were generated by the joint
venture. Trinidad-Tobago accused Tesoro of wire and mail
fraud, racketeering, bribery and violations of prostitution
laws.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Tesoro has always been confident it would prevail in a
trial . . . and still maintains that conviction," the
refining and marketing concern said. "Nonetheless, the
company has elected to settle on what it regards as very
favorable terms compared to the cost of extended litigation."
   Officials of Trinidad-Tobago hailed the settlement as a
victory. Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson said, "The case and
its settlement show that corruption is wrong and the people
of Trinidad and Tobago will tolerate it no longer."

   HOUSTON -- Wainoco Oil Corp., an oil and gas exploration
and production company, said it completed its acquisition of
the U.S. oil and gas properties of Tredegar Industries Inc.,
a Richmond, Va., plastics and aluminum maker, for $15.3
million.
   The properties were acquired for less than the $16.5
million initially expected, because Amerada Hess Corp., New
York, bought some of the properties under a preferential
purchase right, Wainoco said.

   Admit it, frequent fliers. You tune out when the pilot
tunes in to give his customary spiel to passengers.
   But then, you've probably never been aboard Capt. Michael
Berry's flights. The Pan Am pilot's announcements are, well,
different. His motto: "Flying is serious business, but it
doesn't have to be dull."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 28-year veteran flies mostly out of New York's John F.
Kennedy Airport. Given the usual delays there, his
unsuspecting passengers probably don't think too much of it
when he briefs them on the time of their "escape from New
York."
   But, when the seat-belt sign is turned off, the tall,
husky pilot turns on. He reminds passengers they are free to
walk about. "As a matter of fact, if you feel an overwhelming
urge to disco dance in the aisles, you may now do so," he
adds, in his lush Louisiana drawl.
   En route updates go something like this: "Well, we're
passing directly over the Piggly Wiggly supermarket in
downtown St. John's, Newfoundland. . . ."
   "I've put Piggly Wigglys everywhere," says the 50-year-old
pilot. But once, over the Caribbean, he announced the flight
was "180 miles due west of the Piggly Wiggly located on the
island of Bermuda." A passenger, who took him too seriously,
later told him Bermuda's only Piggly Wiggly had become a
Safeway. Now he uses "the Snappy Shine Car Wash."
   Over Washington, D.C., he told passengers some heavy
turbulence was being caused by "thermal variations in the
atmosphere -- a fancy term for hot air rising." Then he
added: "As you might expect, hot air is always a problem in
the Washington area." A flight attendant sent the item to
Reader's Digest, which paid her $300 to publish it.
   His Pan Am Shuttle passengers get this Capt. Kirk-ish
welcome: "These are the voyages of Pan Am Clipper Ship First
Prize. Its one-hour mission: to explore a strange new world.
To boldly go where only this group of carbon-based
terrestrials wanted to go this hour -- the Big Apple."
   Elaine Copland, a New York travel agent, found Capt.
Berry's approach "a very welcome change" during a flight from
Europe. Passengers applauded when the pilot emerged from the
cockpit.
   The flight had arrived early, and Capt. Berry apologized
that "there can be no refund for flying less time than
scheduled." Then he gave his trademark farewell: "Ladies and
gentlemen, you're on your own again. Let's be careful out
there."

   Judge Upholds Ban
   On ABC Broadcast
   Of Games in Cuba

   NEW YORK -- A federal judge ruled that the U.S. can
prohibit Capital Cities/ABC Inc. from broadcasting the 1991
Pan American Games in Cuba under the federal Trading With the
Enemy Act.
   The Treasury Department had refused to allow the
broadcast, claiming that ABC's agreement to pay Cuba $6.5
million for exclusive rights to televise the event violated
the law. The Treasury Department told the network it would
allow the broadcast only if no substantial amount of money
was paid to Cuba.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   ABC sued the Treasury Department in federal court in
Manhattan in December, alleging that the prohibition violated
the network's freedom of speech and was an illegal attempt to
restrict news coverage.
   CBS Inc. and General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting
Co. network filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting ABC.
   Judge John Sprizzo, however, said the restrictions were
constitutional and dismissed ABC's lawsuit. He said that in
this case constitutional concerns about free speech were
outweighed by the executive branch's right to conduct foreign
policy.
   A. Douglas Melamed, an attorney for ABC with Wilmer,
Cutler &amp; Pickering in Washington, said, "While no decision
has been made, it is likely we'll appeal."
   To win rights to broadcast the sports event, which is held
in a different member nation every four years, ABC agreed to
pay the Pan American Sports Organization $8.7 million, with
the understanding that 75% of the money would be passed on to
Cuba. The network said that the Treasury Department's
proposed alternatives, which called for paying only minimal
travel expenses in Cuba, were unacceptable to the Pan
American Sports Organization, which includes a group
representing the U.S.
   The judge rejected arguments that the broadcast agreement
was protected by a 1988 law adopted by Congress to exempt
informational materials from trade embargoes. The judge said
the law's legislative history was too vague to determine
whether such agreements were protected, and he left it to the
agency to interpret the law.
   Floyd Abrams, an attorney for CBS and NBC in their
friend-of-the-court brief, said the 1988 law was meant to
include such broadcasts, and Congress's intent in passing the
law will be an important issue if the case is appealed.
   ABC also argued that the Treasury Department was
misapplying its own regulations because the restrictions
allow newsgathering activities to proceed without prior
approval. But Judge Sprizzo said the agency has the right to
decide whether the broadcast agreement fell under the
category of news gathering.
   Mr. Abrams said he was also concerned about why the
Treasury Department would take a hard line against the
broadcast. "At a time of cooling rhetoric around the world
and a decrease in international tensions, it is difficult to
understand why First Amendment interests must be trumped by
Cold War ones," he said.

   Sundstrand Corp., Rockford, Ill., disclosed that it has
accumulated an almost 15% stake in Milton Roy Co. and will
seek to acquire the St. Petersburg, Fla., maker of
instrumentation and control equipment.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Sundstrand said it holds 796,000 Milton Roy shares, or
14.99%. In a release, Sundstrand said it acquired the stock
"with the intention of holding it as an investment in the
near term," but "with the ultimate goal of initiating
negotiations that will lead to an acquisition."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sundstrand, which makes aerospace and industrial
equipment, said it considers Milton Roy an "attractive
strategic fit." In St. Petersburg, John McNamara, chief
financial officer of Milton Roy, said: "We have a stated
desire to remain independent." He added, however, that the
board recognizes that it has "a fiduciary responsibility to
assess the fairness and adequacy of any offer presented."
   Sundstrand's filing wasn't disclosed until after the
market closed Friday. In composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, Milton Roy stock closed at $22.875, off 12.5
cents; the company has about 5.3 million shares outstanding.

   WASHINGTON -- After recently saying that its discovery of
a glitch in accounting for zero-coupon bonds sold to Mexico
had caused an immediate jump of $27 billion in debt subject
to the federal debt ceiling, the Treasury has concluded that
there was no glitch.
   A Treasury spokesman, acknowledging "some confusion" in
statutory interpretation, said the department's lawyers have
now determined the initial interpretation was the correct
one. The ruling involved $30 billion in zero-coupons bonds
sold to Mexico earlier this year to help that country
alleviate its debt problem.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest shift, however, doesn't alter the Treasury's
need for an increase in its current $3.12 trillion debt limit
before Congress starts its scheduled August recess. Without
an increase before the recess, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady warned Congress in a recent letter, "it is highly
likely that default would occur before Congress returns in
September."
   Mr. Brady stressed that debt ceilings estimates are
subject to greater-than-usual uncertainty now because the
Resolution Trust Corp. is borrowing working capital from the
Federal Financing Bank, an entity within Treasury. His letter
didn't mention the zero-coupon bonds.

   LONDON (AP) -- The London insurance market paid $344.5
million in settlement of the pollution cleanup from the Exxon
Valdez oil spill in Alaska in March 1989.
   The Institute of London Underwriters, which represents the
company marine insurance market, said it was the largest
single marine claim ever paid by the London insurance market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Pollution cleanup resulting from the Exxon Valdez
disaster and agreement of the claim was finalized only
recently," said the institute's general manager, Peter
Worsfold.
   The money was paid to Thos. R. Miller &amp; Son (Reinsurance
Brokers) Ltd., representing the liability insurers who
incurred the loss for the cleanup, the institute said.
   Members of the institute paid $73.4 million, over 21% of
the total. Institute spokesman Denzil Stuart said the rest
was paid by Lloyd's of London underwriters and some European
insurers.
   The payment was made by electronic transfer through a new
computer system for claims management which connects all the
institute's companies and brokers.
   "Without the new computer technology, settlement of a
claim of this size and complexity, with the many interests
involved, would have taken much longer to process," Mr.
Worsfold said.

   CHICAGO -- McDonald's Corp. will announce today that it's
ending its mini-billboard campaign for its new cheddar cheese
hamburger.
   The ill-fated effort to promote the Cheddar Melt on
newsracks for the Chicago Observer, a newspaper sponsored by
outdoor advertising concerns, drew the ire of many Chicago
residents and civic groups. Hundreds of three-foot by
four-foot signs appeared on sidewalks here last week. The
signs prompted Mayor Richard M. Daley to introduce an
ordinance in the City Council restricting the size of
newsracks and banning advertising on them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rick Johnson, marketing supervisor for McDonald's Chicago
region, said McDonald's had asked the Chicago Observer to
pull the signs from its boxes. The action was taken after a
meeting of the board of Chicago-area franchise
owner-operators with McDonald's officials, according to Mr.
Johnson. "Our concern for the local environment was more
important than our concern for this particular (advertising)
communication," Mr. Johnson said.

   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it issued
fines totaling $165,000 for "major" violations of exchange
trading rules.
   The Merc fined Ronald Wertz, a former commodity
representative, $125,000 for making unauthorized sales in its
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index futures pit and allocating
them to customer accounts in April 1987. The exchange also
said Mr. Wertz made unauthorized transfers of funds out of
customer accounts in 1986 and 1987.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Wertz, who failed to appear at the hearing where the
exchange found him culpable and who couldn't be reached for
comment Friday, also was stripped of his rights to act as a
commodity representative.
   In addition, the exchange fined James G. Sledz $40,000,
and expelled him from membership in the Merc. Mr. Sledz, the
exchange said, "prearranged" yen futures trades in August and
October of 1987. Mr. Sledz "participated in an ongoing
pattern of illegal transactions in which brokers deliberately
converted customer funds and opportunities to their own use
and the use of others," according to the exchange.
   Mr. Sledz is cooperating with federal officials in their
broad investigation into trading abuses at the Chicago
futures pits, and the information about his alleged
violations was included in his plea agreement, a Merc
spokesman said.

   OSLO -- Striking oil workers began shutting down Norway's
offshore petroleum production after last-minute talks failed
to settle on a new contract, the union said.
   The Norwegian Federation of Oil Workers said the strike
could be a long one, but didn't estimate when the strike
might end.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Norway's North Sea fields produced 1.63 million barrels a
day of oil and 1.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas a
month in April, the latest official figures available. Norway
and the U.K. are Europe's largest petroleum producers.
   The government has urged both sides to continue
negotiations, noting that roughly 25% of Norway's national
income comes from petroleum, and "a strike could be grave for
our economy," a government spokesman said.
   The union said the 2.5% pay raise offered to offshore
workers is less than half its demand. The union also said the
strike defends workers' negotiation rights and protests
increased automation that may cost jobs.
   Management maintains that the union's average annual wage,
313,000 kroner ($48,700), is already 85% higher than the
average wage in mainland industry.

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
ordered an investigation of Canada's beer import
restrictions.
   Mrs. Hills acted under the Section 301 provisions of U.S.
trade laws after G. Heileman Brewing Co. Inc., a
Wisconsin-based company, charged that Canadian provinces are
keeping U.S. beer out of the Canadian market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "American beer companies should be able to compete on a
fair basis in the Canadian market, just as Canadian brewers
do here," said Mrs. Hills, who added that Canadian brewers
are exporting five times as much beer to the U.S. as U.S.
brewers are able to export to Canada.
   Mrs. Hills said the U.S. intends to use the
disputes-settlement procedures of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) "to enforce our rights" to export
beer to Canada. Her decision, which was expected, pulls the
plug on a U.S. government inquiry that might lead to
retaliatory trade action if the beer dispute isn't resolved
through bilateral negotiations.
   Mrs. Hills previously discussed the Heileman complaint
with Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie, who conceded that
the beer marketing restrictions of Canadian provinces have
made Canada vulnerable to charges of violating its
international trade obligations.
   In 1988, a GATT panel in Geneva, acting on a complaint
from the European Community, ruled that Canada has
discriminated unfairly against imports of alcoholic
beverages.

   DALLAS -- Kimberly-Clark Corp. and New York Times Co. said
they reached an agreement in principle to sell their jointly
owned Canadian newsprint manufacturer to privately held
Kruger Inc., a Montreal-based pulp and paper mill operator.
   Neither company would disclose the sale price for Spruce
Falls Power &amp; Paper Co., but Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark said
the sale of its 50.5% stake will result in an after-tax
charge of about $44 million, or 55 cents a share, in the
second quarter. New York Times said it doesn't expect to take
a charge because it established a $27 million reserve in last
year's fourth quarter to cover possible losses on the sale of
its forest products group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Losses from North American newsprint operations had been
hurting both U.S. companies. Kimberly-Clark blamed losses
from its North American paper interests for declines in
revenue and income for its paper-products lines last year.
And the reserve taken by New York Times last year was
intended to cover expected losses in newsprint operations
beyond Spruce Falls, a spokeswoman said. New York Times has
minority interests in two other newsprint mills in Canada and
in a paper mill in Maine.
   The companies had held their joint interest in the paper
company, based in Kapuskasing, Ontario, since 1926.
   George Adler, a stock analyst who follows Kimberly-Clark
for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said the sale of the
Canadian mill will have "a positive impact on the bottom
line," regardless of the expected second-quarter charge.
   In composite trading Friday, Kimberly-Clark closed at
$71.625, up 75 cents on the New York Stock Exchange and New
York Times closed at $24.125, up 25 cents on the American
Stock Exchange.

   A U.S. bankruptcy court judge ordered the Chapter 11
proceedings of holding companies of Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. moved from San Francisco
to Cincinnati.
   The unusual transfer is the result of one of the most
hotly contested disputes in the bankruptcy proceedings of the
two Campeau Corp. retail units. Allied bondholders argued
that the holding company cases should be heard in Cincinnati,
where the retail units filed for bankruptcy-court protection
Feb. 15. Four other Federated and Allied creditors committees
supported the request for the transfer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Lloyd King
in San Francisco, Issac M. Pachulski, an attorney for
Federated Stores Inc., and other holding companies argued
that the cases should remain in San Francisco because Ralph's
Grocery Stores Inc., partly owned by one of the network of
four holding companies, is located in California.
   Jonathan M. Jacobson, an attorney for Allied bondholders,
said that the proceedings should be heard by U.S. bankruptcy
court Judge J. Vincent Aug, Jr., in Cincinnati, because the
affairs of the holding companies and retail units are
"completely enmeshed."
   Separately, Allied has announced an agreement with
Chemical Banking Corp. for a new loan facility to finance its
receivables. The arrangement replaces a Citibank financing
that expires today. The agreement calls for $630 million in
receivables financing but can be increased to $700 million.
The loans will be funded by commercial paper. A spokeswoman
for Chemical said this will be the first time a company in
Chapter 11 proceedings has been able to access the commercial
paper market. The agreement must be approved by Judge Aug.

   OTC Focus:
   Small-Stock Boom,
   Long Anticipated,
   Is Still to Come

   Once-unthinkable events such as the reunification of
Germany and the release of Nelson Mandela may be unfolding
before our eyes, but the oft-proclaimed resurgence of small
stocks remains to be seen.
   Though this was supposed to be the year small stocks
rallied out of their seven-year siesta, they slumber on. Only
technology and emerging-growth stocks have advanced, leaving
behind other kinds of issues, both large and small.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say they don't expect any change in this pattern
because investors are bidding up prices for predictable
earnings growth and recession resistance -- regardless of
size.
   "I don't think small is an advantage. Small is trouble. I
can't buy it, I can't sell it and the information is funny,"
says L. Keith Mullins, emerging growth analyst for Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   That hasn't kept Mr. Mullins from reaping the rewards of
125 "high octane" fast-growing companies included in the
Morgan Stanley Emerging Growth Stock Index. The companies
have an average market capitalization -- price times shares
outstanding -- of $225 million.
   The Morgan Stanley index is up 13% through Thursday,
compared with a 1.2% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index in
the first half and a mere 0.5% gain in the Russell index of
2,000 smaller stocks. Morgan Stanley, betting that
performance would continue, recently raised to 18% from 15%
the weighting of emerging-growth stocks in its model stock
portfolio.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, which
regulates and operates over-the-counter trading through its
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations system, brags that at mid-year Nasdaq is heading
toward the second-highest annual share and dollar volume in
its 20-year history. But though trading has been brisk in
some high-growth and technology issues, the activity hasn't
spread willy-nilly to other small stocks, analysts say.
   "We're still in a selective market, rather than a
broad-based rush to smallcaps {stocks}," says Jack Granahan,
comanager of the $300 million Vanguard Explorer Fund. Mr.
Granahan, who has followed small stocks since the late 1960s,
says 1990 isn't shaping up as a repeat of 1983, a year he
remembers for investors' "conceptual romancing" of smaller
issues.
   Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Jeffrey Kessler says he's
"being asked about good ideas; I'm not being pushed on
oneproduct, $3 stocks that will have no earnings five years
from now." Also absent, unlike 1983, are constant requests
for "hot tips," promotions of stocks already selling at high
multiples of per-share earnings, and a surge of initial
public offerings of marginal-quality stocks, Mr. Kessler
adds.
   In Bethesda, Md., former Washington Redskins center Dan
Ryczek says his outlook on small-cap stocks is bleak. Mr.
Ryczek, manager of the Rushmore Fund, also manages an OTC
Index Fund pegged to the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index of
largest OTC stocks. Since 1985, he says, the index has been
"excellent" at telegraphing market moves.
   "It's telling me to be careful here," Mr. Ryczek says,
noting the fund is up only 0.4% since Jan. 1. "It's telling
me we're late in the day rather than in a move to the
upside."
   Financial issues have had a dismal year as the savings and
loan crisis, sagging real estate markets and poor loan
portfolios have taken their toll on regional banks and
thrifts, notes John Powell, manager of the T. Rowe Price
Small-Cap Value Fund. The Nasdaq Financial Index is down
10.5% from year end.
   Mr. Powell also suggests that smaller stocks are being
shunned by strategists who rotate their investments among
stocks, bonds and cash, and who buy baskets of stocks rather
than individual shares. Such buyers demand liquidity, or the
ability to easily buy and sell stocks, which is lacking in
many smaller shares. "Trends are favoring liquidity in the
market," suggests Mr. Powell, who adds that trying to explain
the weak performance of small stocks "has been a fruitless
task."
   If the past is prelude, even this year's gains in emerging
growth and technology shares could fizzle. "Over the past
five years, if you had sold all of your {small-stock}
holdings on May 31 and retreated to the beach with a book to
sit out the remainder of the year, your annual return would
have averaged 17.4% versus a 12.7% gain for those poor stiffs
who slugged it out for the full year," Mr. Mullins wrote in a
recent report.
   "However," he added, "at the risk of being poorer and less
tanned, we are keeping our investment position relatively
intact."
   In general, investors seem to be favoring relatively new
companies that have gone public in the past five years and
shown consistent earnings growth, according to Mr. Mullins.
"Older companies have time to develop warts," he explains.
   His picks are shares of companies with an estimated annual
average growth rate of 26% over the next five years. On
average, the stocks trade at about 53% of their estimated
growth rate, or roughly 14 times estimated growth. By
comparison, he estimates the 500 stocks in Standard &amp; Poor's
index are trading at 141% of his projected 9% annual growth
rate-a rate he calls "very optimistic."
   Among the OTC stocks he recommends are Dynasty Classics, a
maker of lighting fixtures; Centex Telemanagement, which
manages telecommunications for small businesses; and
Healthcare Services Group, a provider of housekeeping and
laundry services to nursing homes.
   High on the list are several computer-related companies:
Linear Technology, a maker of integrated circuits; SynOptics,
a maker of local area networks for computers; Mentor
Graphics, which provides computer-aided engineering systems;
and Novell, a maker of personal computer network systems.
   Mr. Kessler of Shearson says he's searching for stocks
that weathered the 1981-82 recession or, if they didn't exist
then, are in recession-resistant businesses. "At Shearson, we
don't have `recession' in our vocabulary at this time, but
there is that risk," he says. He looks for companies with a
consistent 12% to 15% annual average growth rate, but not
highfliers that might "turn into a Roman candle and blow up."
   With an economic slowdown unmistakable in the second
quarter, Mr. Kessler is recommending stocks of a few
companies in the security business, such as Sensormatic
Electronics and Checkpoint Systems. If corporate revenues are
slowing, he explains, "the only way to protect the bottom
line is to prevent shoplifting or {inventory} `shrinkage.' "
   Shearson's forecasters also expect interest rates to ease,
he adds. "If that's the case, the combination of a sluggish
economy should bode well for stocks that can make it through
and produce earnings in a sluggish economy," Mr. Kessler
says.

   In regard to your May 10 editorial "Lost Opportunity"
about the Senate's failure to approve a capital-gains tax cut
last November, I do not wish to quarrel with the excellent
sense of your editorial in the slightest, but why call this a
lost opportunity? Although the federal deficit is many times
larger and the crises we face in social wars far more evident
than they were in 1985, I do not understand why the
opportunity to lower the capital-gains tax is any less.
Particularly if the American people are united in demanding
it.
   I've been a long-term investor in both real estate and the
market since 1943, and I owe much of my success to the more
sensible tax code in place before 1986. The main benefit to
America is the unquestionable rise in revenue that would
ensue if the capital-gains tax were reduced. If longterm
investors were to be confronted with the bargains they would
have from a lower tax on sale of appreciated assets, the
effect would be enormous. Perhaps the reduction of the
federal deficit, as important as it would be when accompanied
by the natural reduction in inflation, is not as significant
to America's future as the break middle-income investors
would get from longterm appreciation.
</LP>

   Middle-income people have virtually no other way to save
up for the enormous costs of college education for their
children. And the housing and construction industry, now in a
predicament, could be given a shot in the arm if
middle-income folks could invest in family homes. If demand
for homes rises, the relative cost of mortgages goes down.
And every industry would benefit from a renewed lower tax on
capital gains. I think this is still very much worth fighting
for.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Bush Gambles Ends Will Justify Means
   As Tax-Policy Shift Angers Right Wing

   WASHINGTON -- In the end, President Bush decided, actions
speak louder than lips.
   In abandoning his politically potent anti-tax pledge, Mr.
Bush calculated that the conservatives who were most outraged
by his decision will eventually return to his camp -- both
because their arguments will be lost amid a reinvigorated
economy and because, says one close adviser, "They have no
place else to go."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a session with reporters, President Bush acknowledged
that his sudden announcement that tax revenue increases will
be part of any budget accord has sent "the arrows flying."
But he said he expects he will ultimately be judged more on
the results of the decision than on the fact that he went
back on his promise: "More important than posturing now or
even negotiating is the result. Do we continue to provide
jobs for the American people and do we continue to provide
economic growth, and do we try to stop saddling the
generations on the way up and the young people with
absolutely unacceptable deficits?"
   In the meantime, the arrows have indeed been flying on the
president's right flank since the Tuesday announcement. The
conservative Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think
tank whose leaders have supported Mr. Bush on other tough
issues, called the move a "deplorable flip-flop" and likened
it to Mr. Bush's burning a flag or offering a pardon to
Willie Horton, the furloughed Massachusetts convict that Mr.
Bush made infamous in the 1988 presidential campaign.
   One of Mr. Bush's 1988 primary opponents, Christian
broadcaster Pat Robertson, was even more blunt. On his 700
Club television show last week, Mr. Robertson characterized
the president's statement as: "Read my lips, I also lie." And
Ralph Reed, a Robertson associate who heads a conservative
group called Christian Coalition, said in an interview that
"George Bush has guaranteed himself primary opposition in
1992."
   But presidential allies dismiss such talk. They note
public-opinion polls show that most of the public seems
prepared to blame others, such as former President Reagan or
Congress, much more than Mr. Bush if taxes do rise. And if a
successful deficit-reduction package succeeds in boosting the
economy, no one will care about the conservatives'
complaints, they argue.
   "If you get results, that's all that counts. Nothing works
better than a good economy," says GOP pollster Robert Teeter,
a close associate of Mr. Bush who conferred with him several
times in recent weeks. Even if conservatives remain unhappy
with the president, he is still likely to be infinitely more
acceptable to them than anyone the Democrats nominate in
1992.
   For the moment, says GOP political consultant John
Buckley, "there isn't an immediate mechanism by which they
{conservatives} can hurt the White House. The belief is that
conservatives sure aren't going to punish congressional
candidates for what the White House has done." The White
House, says Mr. Buckley, is "preparing for an exam in 1992. I
think they think they can flunk any number of conservative
quizzes between now and then and still not flunk the
cumulative exam."
   Moreover, White House officials note that the chorus of
complaints from the right, while widespread, is far from
unanimous. At least some normally stringently anti-tax voices
(including this newspaper's editorial page) have been
restrained in their criticism, saying they will wait to see
whether the president can deliver on his other goals for the
budget summit -- significant social-program spending cuts and
an overhaul of the government's budgetary process -- before
deciding whether to condemn him for his apostasy on taxes.
   Still, while discounting any long-term threat to the
president from the right on taxes, White House aides and
allies admit some danger exists. The principal risk, they
say, is that the issue could prompt conservatives who were
already suspicious of Mr. Bush's commitment to their causes
to become a nuisance, continually setting off political brush
fires against him and burning up resources.
   Angry conservatives, however, insist the dangers to the
president go further. "In politics, intensity counts for
something," says Mr. Reed, the Robertson ally. "In '80 and
'84 we worked with intensity. We delivered for {Ronald
Reagan} because he was talking our language and singing our
song." By contrast, he suggests, many conservatives might sit
on their hands in 1992, especially if the Democratic nominee
isn't closely identified with the party's liberal wing.
   Stuart Butler, director of domestic policy at the Heritage
Foundation, adds, "I know there is this notion that he is
only alientating a constituency that has nowhere else to go."
But that notion, he says, "is overlooking the fact that they
are a constituency that is mad as hell."
   Mr. Bush, for his part, insisted in his news conference
that his policy reversal didn't represent a change in his
philosophy on taxes but rather a requirement of leadership.
   "We've got a very important national problem, and I think
the president owes the people his judgment at the moment he
has to address that problem," the president said. "And that's
exactly what I'm trying to do." He knew he would "catch some
flak on this decision," he insisted, "but I've got to do what
I think is right, and then I'll ask the people for support."
   Noting that he is about to begin a week of discussions
with world leaders that will culminate with next week's
Houston summit of the leading industrialized nations, the
president said: "I am optimistic that we can get a budget
agreement legislated which not only tells the world that
America puts its fiscal house in order, but also will garner
the full support of the American people."

   NEW YORK -- A federal appeals court ruled that
state-regulated utilities can be sued under the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.
   The decision by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals
in Manhattan reversed part of a ruling by U.S. District Judge
Jack B. Weinstein, who overturned a RICO jury verdict against
Long Island Lighting Co. in 1989.

   The appeals court upheld other aspects of Judge
Weinstein's decision, however, and agreed that the verdict
should have been overturned. The case dealt with allegations
that Lilco lied to New York state regulators to obtain higher
rates to finance the Shoreham nuclear power plant. The closed
plant on Long Island is now owned by New York state.
   The appeals court said that utilities can be sued under
RICO, although the law -- and its legislative history --
doesn't directly address the issue. Judge Weinstein had ruled
that applying RICO in cases involving utilities would be an
intrusion of federal law in areas historically controlled by
state governments.
   The appeals court said, "While ambiguities as to what
conduct constitutes a violation may lurk in the RICO statute,
the statute isn't ambiguous as to whether its proscriptions
extend to a state-regulated public utility." Since a public
utility is an "entity capable of holding a legal . . .
interest in property," as RICO requires, it falls under the
scope of the law, the court said.
   In the decision, the appeals court also upheld a related
settlement that Lilco reached with ratepayers in 1989 to
reduce electric rates by $390 million over ten years. The
appeals court rejected claims that the judge improperly
approved too small an amount.

   A San Antonio, Texas, television reporter, jailed last
week for refusing to name confidential sources, is "bothered
most" that he was incarcerated even after authorities
determined his notes wouldn't affect the outcome of a murder
case he was covering.
   Brian Karem, a 29-year-old reporter with KMOL-TV, started
a six-month sentence Wednesday following a round of appeals
and a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court. He was charged with
contempt last year when he refused to give the names of three
people who helped arrange a telephone interview with accused
killer Henry David Hernandez in the county jail regarding the
shooting death of a San Antonio policeman.

   "I made a promise" to protect the sources' identity, Mr.
Karem said from the same county jail. "I intend to keep that
promise."
   A wide array of players -- attorneys, journalists, media
critics and others -- hope the case will force the courts to
clarify the murky area of First Amendment law surrounding
journalistic privilege. The U.S. Supreme Court case most
often cited is ambiguous on this point and is nearly 20 years
old.
   "The law from the U.S. Supreme Court has been less than
clear on this for a number of years," said John H. McElhaney,
an attorney whose media clients include the Dallas Morning
News and WFAA-TV in Dallas, both A.H. Belo Corp. properties.
"It is not in the public's interest to tie up reporters in
every . . . case," he said.
   The federal magistrate who reviewed Mr. Karem's case, John
W. Primomo, said in an interview that "the law in this area
is not well-established." The magistrate, after a closed
hearing with Mr. Karem and his attorney, determined that the
journalist's notes "would not be important" in prosecuting or
defending Mr. Hernandez and his brother Julian, who was also
charged with the murder of Officer Gary Williams in March
1989. That has been enough to prompt some federal courts to
forgo pursuing contempt charges against journalists.
   But the magistrate said he also found that, while there
might be journalistic privilege in civil cases, "there is no
reporter privilege to withhold information in a criminal case
where the interests of the state in prosecuting and the
interest of the defendant outweigh the interest of the
reporter."
   Defense and prosecuting attorneys in the murder case had
clamored for Mr. Karem's notes, claiming the identities of
the intermediaries who helped set up the Hernandez interview
might affect the outcome of the case. Those lawyers weren't
immediately available to comment late yesterday.
   The journalist handed over transcripts of the interview,
the news segment that aired and raw footage that didn't, but
he wouldn't give up the notes, saying to do so would make him
"nothing more than another investigative arm for law
enforcement" and make future sources clam up. Two of the
three sources have since been identified without Mr. Karem's
assistance, but the third hasn't come forward.
   If the source does speak up, Mr. Karem will be freed.
Meanwhile, the contempt charge has been appealed to a federal
appeals court in New Orleans. Mr. Karem's attorney had asked
the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the charge until that appeal
is heard, but the high court refused, and the journalist had
to start serving the sentence.
   The reporter "has an abrasive personality and angers
people profoundly," said Forrest Carr, managing editor of Mr.
Karem's station. "But regardless of what you think of his
personality, you have to believe in what he's fighting for,"
he said. "We're 100% behind Brian."

   Canadian Farmers
   Lift Wheat Acreage
   By 3.2% This Year

   OTTAWA -- Canadian farmers have increased their wheat
acreage by an estimated 3.2% this year, apparently confident
that the Canadian Wheat Board can again sell whatever
Canadian wheat that's produced.
   The wheat board is a government agency that handles
Canadian exports of wheat and barley. In nine of the past 10
years, the board has been able to sell practically all of the
wheat and barley farmers wanted to deliver.

   Statistics Canada, a government agency that surveys
farmers, estimated Friday that Canada's wheat acreage this
year has increased to 34,744,000 acres from 33,671,600 last
year. Canada is usually the second largest wheat exporter
after the U.S., with Canadian sales accounting for about 21%
of world wheat exports.
   Canadian spring wheat, which is seeded in the spring and
harvested in the autumn, accounted, as usual, for most of the
country's wheat acreage. This year's spring wheat seeding was
the largest since 1986,totaling an estimated 27,953,500
acres, a 6.7% increase from last year.
   Price prospects for this year's spring wheat crop aren't
encouraging, however. The Wheat Board's asking export price
for the top grade of Canadian Western Red Spring wheat has
declined to US$163 a metric ton from $193 a ton in January. A
metric ton of wheat is equivalent to 36.74 bushels. "The
{price} drop reflects market expectations of an increase in
global wheat stocks in the current year after three years of
decline as well as seasonal pressure from new crop supply,"
said Patricia Mohr, senior economist at Bank of Nova Scotia.
   Statistics Canada estimated that acreage for durum wheat,
which is used to make pasta products, declined 13.2% to
5,600,000 acres. It was the first decline in durum acreage
since 1983. U.S. durum growers have complained that Canadian
durum has been making inroads into the U.S. market because of
alleged Canadian subsidies. But last week the U.S.
International Trade Commission, which investigated the
complaints, issued a report in Washington indicating there
wasn't any evidence that Canadian durum was unfairly priced.
   Statistics Canada estimated Canada's winter wheat acreage,
which was seeded last autumn, at 1,190,500 acres, a 16.9%
increase from last year.
   Statistics Canada estimated Canada's rapeseed acreage at
6,350,000 acres, a 11.5% decline from last year. This year's
rapeseed acreage is the smallest seeding since 1983 but it is
9% more than the area farmers indicated in March that they
intended to sow. Rapeseed, also known as canola, is Canada's
main oilseed crop.
   Flaxseed acreage is estimated to have increased 18.4% to
1,870,000 acres. The report is expected to bolster flaxseed
prices because the increase is smaller than expected and
flaxseed supplies are tight, said Harvey Hanec, vice
president and prairie commodity coordinator for Scotia-McLeod
Inc.
   Barley acreage was estimated to have declined 2.1% to
11,808,000. Mr. Hanec said the barley estimate was bullish
for the market because the acreage estimate was smaller than
expected. Barley is Canada's main feed grain.
   Oats acreage was estimated to have declined 13% to
4,447,000 acres. But Mr. Hanec said the market had expected a
bigger drop and he predicted the report would be bearish for
oats.
   Cool, wet weather slowed seeding in many parts of the
country this spring, but farmers were generally able to
complete planting on schedule.
   Growing conditions have been generally favorable. The
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, a farmers' cooperative, reported
Friday that recent hot weather has helped bring crops along
in Saskatchewan, Canada's biggest wheat growing province. But
it said the hot weather also has led to drier soil conditions
and most areas of the province need rain within the next week
to 10 days.
