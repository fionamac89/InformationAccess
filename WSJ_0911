   Cambodian Agreement, Talks in Korea
   Spotlight the Spread of Detente in Asia
   ----

   TOKYO -- The mood of detente that has swept much of the
world is starting to catch on in Asia. While the Middle East
confrontation dominates the headlines, Asia abounds with
examples of easing tensions.
   Yesterday, the warring factions in Cambodia agreed to
share power and let the United Nations supervise an end to
their 11-year civil war. A few days before, North and South
Korea -- still in a state of war that has lasted 40 years --
began a high-level dialogue. And in a related move, Japan's
icy relations with North Korea have begun to thaw. Even Tokyo
and Moscow are inching closer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I think basically, without much hesitation at all, you
can say that things are getting better" in Asia, says Takashi
Inoguchi, a Tokyo University Asia specialist.
   It would be an exaggeration to say peace is breaking out
all over; the signs of detente remain tentative, and there is
no guarantee that any of them will lead to bigger things. But
the trend is hopeful, and that's a big change for a region
that stood out, prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as an
exception to the world-wide trend toward detente.
   Underlying everything is the end of the Cold War between
the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The two nations are still at
odds over reductions in naval forces in the Pacific -- Moscow
wants them, Washington doesn't -- but the change in their
relations was evident yesterday when a U.S. cruiser and
frigate tied up in Vladivostok, the Soviet navy's Pacific
home port -- something U.S. Navy ships haven't done in almost
half a century.
   The U.S. and the Soviet Union are now cooperating to push
a compromise in Cambodia. The two nations, with China, put
intense pressure on the four battling Cambodian factions,
leading them to agree on the composition of a U.N.-proposed
Supreme National Council. The council is a symbolic body that
would pass most of its powers to the U.N., which would
arrange elections, a halt to the fighting, and installation
of a new government.
   The agreement calls for a 12-member council, with six
seats held by the Vietnam-supported Cambodian government of
Premier Hun Sen, and two seats each by the three members of
the guerrilla resistance coalition, which is supported by
China and, until recently, the U.S. (The U.S. withdrew its
backing last month, saying it didn't want the Khmer Rouge to
govern Cambodia again, and agreed to begin talks with Vietnam
on the Cambodian problem.)
   The council, the Cambodian factions agreed, is to be
headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, nominal head of the
guerrilla coalition, which is dominated by the militarily
more powerful, and feared, Khmer Rouge. A non-communist
member of the guerrilla coalition called the agreement a
"breakthrough," but diplomats warned against optimism. "It's
still in the balance," said one diplomat. "The Indonesians
(co-chairing the talks with France) certainly don't think
it's in the bag yet."
   Political movement on the Korean peninsula, where hundreds
of thousands of troops have faced off for decades, has been
helped by the Soviet Union's recent diplomatic flirtation
with South Korea, a staunch U.S. ally. Moscow has allowed
substantial increases in South Korean trade and is inching
toward diplomatic recognition of Seoul -- trends that make
North Korea more eager to improve ties with South Korea and
Japan.
   The North Korean and South Korean prime ministers met in
Seoul last week for the first time. They agreed to meet again
in Pyongyang next month, and to reopen talks on reuniting
separated families. But the fundamental differences dividing
North and South Korea are vast.
   Like East Germany, North Korea has been by far the less
successful economic half of a divided country. But unlike
East Germany, which was willing to accept capitalism to make
reunification with West Germany possible, North Korea seems
committed to its rigidly centralized Communist dictatorship.
   Only slightly less difficult are Japan's relations with
North Korea and the Soviet Union. The Soviets and the North
Koreans are eager for Japanese trade and investment, and both
are making their separate overtures. North Korea lacks
diplomatic ties with Japan, but has invited a senior
statesman of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shin
Kanemaru, to Pyongyang this month for talks.
   If the North Koreans free two Japanese seamen they have
held since 1983, further talks aimed at a broad improvement
in relations might go forward. But politicians helping
prepare Mr. Kanemaru's visit say North Korea's intentions
aren't clear.
   The big stumbling block between Tokyo and Moscow continues
to be the Soviets' refusal to give back four islands they
took after World War II. In a hopeful sign last week, Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze made clear the Soviet
Union's willingness to talk about the issue. In April,
President Mikhail Gorbachev had said the Soviet Union had "no
land to spare."
   But the Soviets have agreed to talk about the islands
before, and Mr. Shevardnadze didn't make any specific
promises. Soviet specialists in Tokyo believe the Soviet
leadership isn't likely to make up its mind until serious
preparations get under way for Mr. Gorbachev's scheduled
visit to Japan in April.
   Still, if anything is clear, it's the Soviet Union's
overall determination to improve its ties to Asia. In a
speech last week, Mr. Shevardnadze proposed "regional
negotiating institutions" to promote "broad-based dialogue"
on problems in the area. Though the little-noticed speech
lacked details and rehashed earlier proposals, it was
remarkable, says a Western diplomat, in its determination to
make Soviet Asian policy "keep step with" its European
advances."
   But the Western diplomat notes that while the Soviet
Union's East European allies have pushed Moscow to be more
forthcoming, it's far from clear how eager its Asian allies,
such as Kim Il Sung of North Korea, are to make progress.

   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. said it signed a
memorandum of understanding with Japan Air Lines to discuss
investment by JAL in the aerospace concern's newly formed
Lockheed Commercial Aircraft Center Inc. subsidiary.
   A Lockheed spokesman said the company plans to invest
about $20 million to modify a hangar and purchase equipment
for the unit, which will maintain and modify Boeing Co. 747
aircraft. JAL may acquire a minority stake of 10% or more in
the unit, the spokesman said. Aircraft modification is a
growing business for Lockheed and other aerospace companies,
as their defense business shrinks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Lockheed unit has agreed with Norton Air Force Base in
San Bernardino, Calif., to lease two bays of a four-bay
hangar. When the base closes, sometime before 1994, Lockheed
will occupy the rest of the hangar. Each bay can accommodate
one Boeing 747 jetliner.
   JAL has the world's largest fleet of Boeing 747s and is
highly experienced in maintaining and modifying the plane,
Lockheed said. JAL anticipates that a significant number of
its aging 747 aircraft will need modifications in the near
future, Lockheed said.
   Lockheed is preparing the hangars to meet commercial
specifications. The facility is expected to begin operations
in the first quarter of next year. After a year of operation,
the unit is expected to have about 600 employees, increasing
to nearly 1,000 by 1994. The spokesman said Lockeed has about
75,000 employees.

   Aerospace Firm
   To Restructure
   Retiree Plan

   McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Will Realize Big Gain
   In the Third Quarter

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it would restructure its
retiree benefit plan, allowing it to recognize a $234 million
gain in the third quarter.
   News of the windfall, equal to $6.11 a share, helped raise
the struggling aerospace concern's price on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday; it finished in composite trading at
$48.75, up $1.125
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An accounting adjustment will be made as the St. Louis
concern transfers its benefit obligations for 14,200 salaried
retirees, currently covered by an overfunded
company-administered pension plan, to a group annuity
contract with Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. The action will
decrease the number of liabilities in the company-run fund,
which will still have 26,400 participants. In turn, the plan
will become even more overfunded than before, allowing for
the third-quarter gain.
   At the end of 1989, the plan had $5.9 billion in assets
and was overfunded about $2 billion.
   McDonnell Douglas stressed that the annuity arrangement
"in no way alters the benefits due affected retirees or the
manner in which the payments are made." In fact, it said the
new system will "strengthen the benefit security" for
salaried employees. It noted that other corporations,
including Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Manufacturers Hanover
Corp. and Edison Brothers Stores Inc., have taken similar
steps.
   In the past, however, the Pentagon has stepped in when
defense contractors have tinkered with their overfunded
pension plans, saying the government is entitled to at least
some of the assets because money poured into these funds was
derived from military contracts.
   Just last month, for example, the Defense Department's
inspector general's office disclosed that it was
investigating whether Ford Motor Co. should be able to remove
$100 million from the pension fund of its aerospace unit
before selling the subsidiary to Loral Corp. In addition,
according to a 1989 Bear Stearns study, FMC Corp. and
Fairchild Industries attempted to recapture their excess
pension funds, but had to share or give back the surplus to
the Pentagon.
   But the McDonnell Douglas situation appears different.
   Although the company's equity position will improve as a
result of its deal with Metropolitan Life, it is not
terminating its pension plan, as has happened in other cases,
and it will receive no cash as a result of the transaction.
"There appears to be a real distinction here," said Lawrence
Harris, a securities analyst who follows McDonnell Douglas
for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., a Los Angeles
brokerage firm.
   "Not a penny will change hands," added Jerry Cantwell, of
Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New York. A Pentagon spokesman
said he couldn't comment on the particulars of the McDonnell
Douglas move.
   Actually, the company has been recording asset gains to
recognize the overfunded portion of its pension plan since
changing its accounting methods in 1987. The pact with
Metropolitan Life -- the precise terms of which weren't
disclosed -- will merely allow McDonnell Douglas to
accelerate the recognition of that situation and adjust its
books all at once; smaller gains will continue to be
amortized in the future.
   In the year-ago third quarter, McDonnell Douglas posted
net income of $38 million, or 98 cents a share, on sales of
$3.72 billion. The results included an extraordinary gain of
$6 million, or 14 cents a share, for the divestiture of the
bulk of the company's information systems group.
   McDonnell Douglas, the nation's No. 1 defense contractor,
also got a lift last week when the U.S. said it completed
negotiations with South Korea for the sale of 120 of the
company's F/A-18 jet fighters to Seoul. Moreover, analysts
noted, the Persian Gulf crisis has been a boon by providing
an opportunity for more F/A-18 and F-15 jet sales to the
Middle East.
   Before the pension-plan announcement, Mr. Harris said he
expected McDonnell Douglas to earn about 50 cents a share in
the current period, reflecting possible cost overruns on some
military programs and continued development expenses on the
new MD-11 commercial jetliner. Still, Herbert Lanese,
McDonnell Douglas's chief financial officer, said in a recent
interview that a massive cost-cutting drive initiated in July
would begin to bear fruit soon. "You should see some effect
in the third quarter, and it will really kick in in the
fourth," he said.

   CHICAGO -- UAL Corp. said August traffic at its United
Airlines unit increased 10.1%, to 7.87 billion revenue
passenger miles, from the year-earlier 7.15 billion.
   A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one
mile.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The August figure represented the "best monthly traffic in
United's history," the company said. "Unfortunately," UAL
added, "the cost of providing the services also is escalating
sharply with the dramatic increase in jet fuel prices."
   Load factor, or percentage of seats filled, was 75.3% in
the latest month, off from the year-earlier 77.3%.
   For the year to date, United traffic has increased 8.3% to
51.04 billion revenue passenger miles, from 47.15 billion.
Year-to-date load factor held steady at 67.6% overall,
although the load factor on North American flights slipped to
65% from 66.6%.

   NEW YORK -- KPMG Peat Marwick's board nominated Jon C.
Madonna to succeed Larry D. Horner as chairman and chief
executive officer of the accounting and consulting firm's
U.S. practice.
   Mr. Madonna, 47 years old, currently heads the firm's San
Francisco office and sits on the 34-member board. P.J.
Butler, senior partner of the U.K. practice, has been
nominated to succeed Mr. Horner as head of the international
practice. If Mr. Butler is elected by the KPMG council, his
term will begin Jan. 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The board also nominated James G. Brocksmith Jr., 49, to
succeed Robert W. Beecher as deputy chairman for a three-year
term. Mr. Brocksmith is head of the firm's Chicago office.
Mr. Beecher would reach the mandatory retirement age of 60
during another term.
   The board's nomination doesn't guarantee that the
candidates will be elected by a majority of the firm's 1,850
partners, who are to meet Oct. 4 to vote. Partners have until
Sept. 20 to nominate their own candidates; a nomination by 5%
of the partners is required. No alternative slates have been
proposed. Terms begin immediately after election in October.
   In early August, Mr. Horner, 56, said he wouldn't seek
re-election. He could have stood for an additional three-year
term, but he said issues at the firm required an executive
who would be able to serve a longer time. The chairman's term
is six years.
   KPMG Peat Marwick is the U.S. national practice of KPMG.
It was formed in the December 1986 merger of Peat Marwick
International and Klynveld Main &amp; Goerdeler.

   How safe is my job?
   For many people, that's the issue of the 1990s. It's
becoming clear that corporate cutbacks weren't an '80s
oddity, but rather are likely to persist through the new
decade. So far this year, by one estimate, U.S. employers
have been trimming 30,000 people from their payrolls -- a
month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Today's edgy employees can get some clue about how secure
their jobs are by taking the quiz offered here. It was
developed by exploring both those factors that have
determined just who has been laid off in the past and the
outlook for specific jobs, career paths and industries with a
number of academics, consultants and corporate executives.
   A high tally on this unscientific quiz (on which possible
scores range from 24 to zero) shouldn't prompt people to
start clearing out their desks. Paul Hirsch, a professor at
Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, notes
that in any cutback, "more people are scared than wind up
getting hurt. Whenever 10% get cut, 90% worry that it will
happen to them."
   Further, a company's particular style of treating
employees -- whether paternalistic, cold-blooded or in
between -- will be a factor. "You might come up with all the
right answers," says Robert Tomasko, a consultant with Arthur
D. Little Inc. and author of a book on corporate cutbacks.
"But you can't assume your company is acting rationally."
   Still, the answers provide clues to help people look at
their jobs the way their bosses do.

   SCORING THE RESULTS
                                                                                                       

   1. Industry: Score a point for financial-services
industries such as banking, brokerage and insurance
companies.
   These, says Mr. Tomasko of Arthur D. Little, are the
industries most prone to cutbacks in the early 1990s, along
with utilities, local telephone companies, consumer-goods
makers (still takeover candidates), defense contractors (hurt
by spending cutbacks) and retailers. Score a point for all of
these fields.
   Give yourself a zero if you are in an industry less likely
to cut back, including heavy manufacturers such as
machine-tool companies, which already cut heavily in the
'80s.
                                                                                                       

   2. Size: Score two points if your employer is a large
company, one if medium-sized and zero if small.
   "In general, the bigger the company, the more likely it is
to be cutting," says Dan Lacey of Lacey &amp; Co., consultants.
An American Management Association survey of personnel
managers at more than 1,200 companies confirms the trend:
Nearly one-third of companies with annual sales exceeding
$500 million plan staff cuts; fewer than 10% of companies
with under $10 million in sales reported such plans.
                                                                                                       

   3. Market share: Count three points for a recent big drop
in market share.
   "Market share was probably the most prevalent reason" for
staff cuts in the '80s, says Aneil Mishra, a research
associate working on a continuing University of Michigan
study of 30 automotive suppliers. Even within individual
companies, units with poorer market-share performance were
"much more aggressive" in cutting staff, he says.
                                                                                                       

   4. Location: Score two points if your job is in the
Northeast, one for the Midwest and zero for the South or
West.
   In the past three years, "the big unemployment increases
have been largely in the Northeast; the big employment
increases have been largely in the West," says Samuel
Ehrenhalt, Northeast regional commissioner for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. He notes that New York dropped to No. 45
among states in job growth last year from No. 27 in 1987. In
the past three years, the bottom 10 states for job growth
have included New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and
Connecticut. Over the same time, Idaho, Washington, Oregon
and Utah all climbed into the top 10.
                                                                                                       

   5. History: Give yourself two points if your company has
already had early retirement or layoff programs, zero if it
hasn't.
   If you think you're safe because your company has made
cuts, think again. The recent American Management Association
study concluded that "the best predictor of future work-force
cuts was past work-force cuts," says Eric Greenberg, editor
of the study. Of companies that had cut staff in the past, he
says, 29% planned to do so again; of companies that had never
cut staff, only 7% planned future cuts.
                                                                                                       

   6. Type of job: Point scores depend on individual factors.
   If your company recently has faced, or faces, a leveraged
buy-out or merger, give yourself a point if you're a senior
manager or supervisor. "The highest executives are vulnerable
in a company that is being bought out," says James Buttimer,
director of organizational planning at Arthur D. Little. And,
he advises, don't be reassured by a friendly takeover team:
"Watch what they do, not what they say."
   But where staff cuts reflect the need to cut costs, Mr.
Buttimer says, middle managers are more vulnerable. Give
yourself a point there.
   In any case, holders of staff jobs should give themselves
two points. When outplacement firm Drake Beam Morin Co.
studied displaced managers over the past three years, they
found that nearly 30% were from general management or
administration; an additional 16% had finance or accounting
backgrounds.
                                                                                                       

   7. Number of subordinates: Tally two points if you have
fewer than three people reporting directly to you; one point
for three to seven subordinates; and zero for more than
eight, because cost-cutting companies try to squeeze more
managing from fewer managers.
   Today, an average manager supervises 3.5 workers, down
from about 10 in the '60s, says Jewell Westerman, a vice
president with consultants Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane Inc. But
today, he says, companies are trying to increase that number.
Phillips Petroleum Co., for example, cut its management costs
to 28 cents a payroll dollar from 30 cents by moving to one
manager per 7.3 people from one per 5.8 in 1983, says Jerry
D. Fultz, manager of employee relations.
                                                                                                       

   8. Dispensability: If outside contractors can do your job
better than you, give yourself three points; if not, score a
zero.
   Employers are making tough make-or-buy decisions about
nearly everything they do. Mr. Tomasko suggests asking
yourself: "`If they had to go outside and buy what I do,
would they do it -- and would they pay enough for it to cover
my salary?'"
                                                                                                       

   9. Customer contact: Give yourself two points if you never
deal with the outside world, zero if you do.
   Many companies, such as International Business Machines
Corp., are shifting their focus from managing to meeting
customers. At American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., "the Maalox
moments are if you have little to do with sales or with the
public," says Burke Stinson, a spokesman. AT&amp;T is cutting out
6,000 positions at its long-distance unit. "There's quite
often a battalion of people who . . . do little else than
meet with other in-house people in a series of meetings,
essentially writing memos to themselves," Mr. Stinson says.
"If you are in one of those jobs, you may be able to duck
attention for a while, but you may not be able to do it
forever."
                                                                                                       

   10. Age: Give yourself a point if you're a man over 40 or
a woman over 30; otherwise, score a zero.
   The Drake Beam Morin survey found that in the three years
ended June 11, the bulk of men displaced -- 47% -- were 40 to
49 years old. For women, the largest age group -- 44% -- was
30 to 39. Low seniority also mattered: More than 60% had been
with their companies for less than 10 years, three-quarters
for less than 15 years.

   11. Performance reviews: Everyone gets a zero on this one.
   "Performance reviews are more irrelevant than relevant,"
says Mr. Tomasko of Arthur D. Little. One reason is their
unreliability. "They are too lenient," says Craig Schneier, a
managing director at consultants Sibson &amp; Co. "Everyone is
rated too high."
   Companies in the University of Michigan study found that
as a result, the number of marginal performers identified was
small, while "the sheer numbers of people they needed to get
rid of was so great" says Mr. Mishra. So, they had to abandon
using performance reviews as a criterion.
                                                                                                       

   12. Flexibility: Give yourself a zero if you're confident
of your ability to take new jobs, or willing to move to new
places. Add one point if you can't relocate, two points if
you consider yourself unlikely to be able to change jobs or
four points if your approach to work is inflexible.
   "The No. 1 skill in the American economy is the ability to
adapt to change," says Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
   Companies increasingly cut back in one area while adding
employees in others. Moreover, when working with a leaner
staff, companies are likely to value switchhitters more.
"When you still have 100% of the work, but only 80% of the
workers, you have to appraise who is going to be a helpful
survivor," says Norman Abazoris, a partner with Hewitt
Associates.

   Futures Trader Accused of Fraud
   Isn't a `Prince of the Pits' at Merc
   ----

   PALATINE, Ill. -- Sam Cali insists that he "played by the
rules" in his nearly 10 years as a futures broker.
   Some of those rules were written in the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange rule book. Others were simply practices devised by a
host of harried exchange members, at all levels, who were
struggling to cope with a crush of customer orders in the
go-go 1980s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I went according to the system," Mr. Cali says. "I didn't
get rich, and I didn't steal any money."
   But prosecutors have a darker view of Mr. Cali: To them,
he is a key defendant among the 14 traders of Japanese-yen
futures who go on trial beginning today for allegedly
stealing customer profits.
   The 39-year-old Mr. Cali, a thin, softspoken man, faces
two counts of racketeering, and more than 90 counts of fraud
and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. He could be
imprisoned for as long as 20 years if found guilty of
racketeering by the 12-member jury in federal district court
in Chicago.
   Mr. Cali certainly doesn't fit the popular image of a
futures trader as a high-rolling Prince of the Pits. He says
he never made more than $65,000 to $70,000 a year as a
Chicago Mercantile Exchange broker. Not bad for a high-school
graduate. But not much compared with the six- and
seven-figure annual incomes reaped by the biggest brokers in
the yen pit.
   Nor does Mr. Cali live in an exclusive suburb or drive a
flashy car. To pay his legal bills, he is being forced to
sell a four-bedroom, two-story colonial home in this
middle-class suburb northwest of Chicago. Until he had to
give up his leased exchange seat recently, Mr. Cali left home
for the Merc every morning at 5:45 a.m. in a five-year old
Volvo that now has 90,000 miles on it.
   Mr. Cali's relatively modest circumstances, and the
similar life styles of many of the other traders on trial,
highlight the difference between the Chicago futures-pit
probe and the Wall Street insider-trading investigation of
the past few years. In New York, insider-trading charges sent
multimillionaire investors such as Ivan Boesky to jail.
   In Chicago, the trial's scope has raised questions about
the government's willingness to pursue the worst offenders.
Critics charge that despite its claims to the contrary, the
government is content to see just small fry jailed in order
to scare the markets into reform. The Merc's 14 yen traders
are among 48 people indicted last year in a government sting
operation aimed at rooting out alleged fraud in the futures
pits.
   Next week, opening statements will be heard in a separate
trial of 10 soybean-futures traders from the Chicago Board of
Trade who are charged with stealing customer trading profits.
An 11th trader, Scott Anixter, pleaded guilty yesterday to
four misdemeanor charges against him in the case, and agreed
to cooperate with the government's probe of soybean traders.
   Nine of the 19 soybean-futures traders indicted last year
have pleaded guilty to reduced charges in return for agreeing
to cooperate with the probe. Six of the 21 indicted
yen-futures traders have pleaded guilty. A seventh yen trader
pleaded no contest to the government charges and is also
cooperating with the investigation.
   The yen and soybean trials, each expected to take at least
four months, will cover ground similar to an earlier case
this summer that resulted in a mixed verdict. In that case, a
federal jury in Chicago convicted two out of three
Swiss-franc traders of a total of eight trading violations,
but remained deadlocked on two-thirds of more than 100
charges against the three.
   Many of the pending charges allege that pit brokers
routinely avoided having to pay for trading errors by
inducing an independent "local" trader in the pit to take a
losing trade into his account. The local would get repaid
later with profits or "points" from other customer orders.
Brokers also stand accused of exploiting futures-price swings
by skimming off a slice of the profits on customer trades. A
futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific
amount of a commodity or financial instrument at a certain
price on a specified future date.
   Mr. Cali grew up on Chicago's North Side, following his
father into the glass business after high school. In 1980 he
joined a high-school friend on the Merc trading floor to
become a futures pit broker. A year and a half ago he
followed another trader and close friend to the trader's
apartment building near the Merc. Once there, Mr. Cali was
confronted by federal agents, including one who had posed for
over a year as a fellow futures broker named Peter Vogel.
   Mr. Cali said he knows he hasn't done anything wrong. But
he refused to comment on any of the specific government
charges against him.
   His attorney, Thomas Durkin of Durkin, Foster &amp; Roberts in
Chicago, has harshly criticized the government's use of
racketeering charges against his client, and said earlier
that Mr. Cali is innocent of all the charges. He declined to
be interviewed for this article.
   Mr. Cali started small when he came to the Merc trading
floor in 1980. He held the "deck" of customer orders for his
high-school friend Dean Kaulentis, who was a broker in the
live cattle-futures trading pit at the Merc. By 1983 Mr. Cali
had transferred to the Japanese yen-futures pit, one of the
Merc's most boisterous and fast-growing trading arenas.
Within a year he was trading as many as 1,000 yen futures
contracts for customers on a busy day, compared with 200
daily when he moved into the pit.
   Peter Vogel, the undercover agent whose real name was
Dietrich Volk, appeared in the yen pit regularly in early
1988. The agent stood in front of and one step below Mr. Cali
in the stepped trading pit. Mr. Cali would chat with the
agent when trading was slow. Occasionally they would have
breakfast together at Lou Mitchell's, a local restaurant
popular with Merc traders.
   The agent was always asking Mr. Cali and other brokers if
he could "help them" execute customer orders. "I must have
told him 100 times no," Mr. Cali said. He said he turned to
another broker in the pit at one point and asked: "Why is
this guy always in my face?"
   The government alleges that Mr. Cali did more than just
say no. When Mr. Cali was confronted by the agent and a
handful of assistant U.S. attorneys in January of 1989 at his
friend's apartment, he said, "I'm not a criminal. I mean I
am, but I'm not," according to the agent's testimony at a
pretrial hearing. The agent testified that Mr. Cali also told
him of participating in specific trades that the government
alleges were fraudulent.
   After the investigation surfaced, Mr. Cali, at the Merc's
request, quit handling customer orders and started trading
one to five contracts at a time for his own account. The Merc
asked that other brokers who were targets of the government
investigation do the same. Mr. Cali said his income plunged
about 80% as a result.
   His wife, Hiba, recently took a job at the checkout
counter of a local Dominick's supermarket to help keep her
mind off the coming trial and to bring in some income. "It's
scary," she says, sitting at the round oak kitchen table with
her husband. "Financially, we're busted."

   I was surprised to read Paul A. Gigot's Aug. 17 "Potomac
Watch" column, which takes exception to my alleged position
on the current crisis in the Persian Gulf. The thrust of this
piece is that I am somehow leading the pack of post-Cold War
right-wing conservatives urging a return to traditional U.S.
isolationism.
   Most journalists -- even those who appear only on the
editorial page -- usually give a public figure the benefit of
a quote before going on to critique or characterize his point
of view. However, Mr. Gigot has failed to extend even this
minimal journalistic courtesy, so it is impossible for me to
know what has led him to this incorrect conclusion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, I have made numerous
public comments. By any objective standard, a reading of the
transcripts of those interviews demonstrates that I have
consistently emphasized:
   -- One, that the U.S. has a vital interest in this region.
   -- Two, that the U.S. had no alternative to responding to
the local nations' appeal for U.S. military assistance to
deter further Iraqi aggression.
   -- Three, that the task of deterring Iraq from further
aggression and seeking the removal of its armed forces from
Kuwait is best handled by a multilateral response --
diplomatically, economically and militarily.
   In this crisis, there are obviously dangers that we should
seek to minimize or avoid. For example, I have stressed that
a protracted U.S. large-scale ground presence in Saudi Arabia
would be difficult for the U.S. to sustain and over time
would cause severe problems for the Saudi government, both
within its own country and within the Arab world.
Consequently, I have urged that we follow a reinforcing
strategy, in which we emphasize air power, and that our
ground forces complement and support those deployed by
indigenous Arab governments, particularly Saudi Arabia and
Egypt. Should Iraq invade Saudi Arabia or use chemical
weapons, I have said that the U.S. should retaliate in a
massive way, with no sanctuaries for Iraq in its own
homeland.
   If Mr. Gigot believes these views constitute an
"isolationist" position, then he is using a definition that
Webster's does not recognize.

   Roses Were Reds, Violets Blues,
   Till They Redid Crayola's Hues

   It was certainly one of the most colorful protests in
business history. A dozen marchers paraded outside a
Pennsylvania factory, dragging along a human skeleton in a
wooden coffin. They carried placards that said: "When Does 8
x 8 Equal Less Than 64? When We Hate the New 8]" and "Indians
Call It Maize, We Call It Gone."
   Then they solemnly took a handful of crayons, broke them
in half, and dropped them into the coffin.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The target of this demonstration was Binney &amp; Smith Inc.,
the maker of Crayola crayons. This summer the company, a unit
of Hallmark Cards Inc., retired eight colors from its
well-known, 64-crayon flip-top box: raw umber, maize, lemon
yellow, blue gray, violet blue, green blue, orange red and
orange yellow. In their place came eight sexy new hues for
the 1990s: wild strawberry, vivid tangerine, fuchsia, teal
blue, cerulean, royal purple, jungle green and dandelion.
   To the company's surprise, the move has drawn an
outpouring of protest from a veritable spectrum of crayon
loyalists. Robert Pagani, a Phillipsburg, N.J., theme-park
worker, created CRAYON, Committee to Re-establish All Your
Old Norms. When Binney &amp; Smith held a special ceremony to
enshrine the eight old colors in the Crayola Hall of Fame,
Mr. Pagani staged the protest march with the coffin and the
skeleton. "They call it a retirement. I call it a burial," he
says.
   Karen Latinik, a sophomore at James Madison University in
Harrisonburg, Va., founded the National Campaign to Save
Lemon Yellow and sent a petition with about 100 signatures.
Binney &amp; Smith's polite reply was signed in lemon yellow
crayon. "That seemed like a slap in the face to me," Ms.
Latinik says.
   Kenneth Lang, a Locust Valley, N.Y., gifts and housewares
manager, sent an aggrieved letter from RUMPS, the Raw Umber
and Maize Preservation Society. Loretta Lampkin, the
associate minister of the First United Methodist Church in
Bossier City, La., wrote Binney &amp; Smith to sadly recall
restoring the polish on her scuffed shoes with the old
colors. Another letter writer, artist Jane Hankins of
Gardner, Mass., warned: "Have you forgotten what happened to
Coca-Cola when they also decided to abandon tradition in
favor of a new `recipe.'"
   And first-grader Ebony Faison from Philadelphia asked:
"Whenever I draw me, I use raw umber. What color should I
color now?"

   California Offers County
   Aid to Avert Bankruptcy

   SAN FRANCISCO -- California has crafted an aid package
that should prevent a distressed rural county from filing for
bankruptcy.
   Last month, Butte County came within a day of becoming the
first county in U.S. history to seek protection from its
creditors under a special chapter in the federal bankruptcy
law. But on Friday, the state's finance department, armed
with emergency legislation, offered a bailout package valued
at $7.4 million and recommended $6.6 million in budget cuts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The county, home to about 180,00 people, is studying the
state's offer, but its board of supervisors has decided to
cancel plans for a bankruptcy filing in the meantime.
   By law, counties in California must balance their budgets
each year. Because of increasing state-mandated services and
repeated voter-rejection of local tax increases, Butte County
has found it impossible to balance its books even after
cutting deeply into library, police and other services.

subordinated debentures outstanding due 2001.
   The commercial banking concern is offering $100 in cash
and three shares of a new issue of preferred for each $1,000
face amount of the debentures. Each share of preferred will
have a liquidation value of $10 a share and can be exchanged
for 26.67 One Bancorp common shares at any time. The
preferred will carry a 7% non-cumulative dividend rate, but
the financially troubled company said it doesn't plan to pay
a dividend in the foreseeable future. The tender offer
expires Oct. 10 and is subject to at least 75% of the

Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, ordered the abolition of cartel-like
agreements in the country's banking industry.
   The long-awaited decision conforms to a request by the
country's cartel commission. The banking industry has
previously said it would appeal such a decision to the Swiss
Supreme Court.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Delamuraz's move caps a long battle between the banks
and the commission over four cartel-like arrangements. The
decree became necessary after the banks and the commission
failed to agree on a solution.
   One of the four pacts deals with the syndicate of big
banks that dominates the underwriting of Swiss-franc bonds.
Mr. Delamuraz's order means that by the end of the year, the
banks must eliminate the so-called "loyalty" clause of the
convention, which prevents members from participating in
transactions outside the syndicate.
   Also at year end, the agreement setting minimum fees for
documentary credits must be abolished.
   Further, the decree orders the elimination by 1992 of the
convention that fixes fees on securities brokerage and of the
pact that governs commissions for custodial operations.

   PARIS -- The heavily indebted French utility Electricite
de France, or EDF, said it needs capital from private
investors to pursue its development, but the Socialist
government is saying "no."
   While France is loosening investment restrictions on some
of its state-owned companies, EDF hasn't convinced the
government that its needs justify outside investment in the
sensitive electricity sector. "Opening its capital would
require a new law, and there are no plans to change EDF's
statutes," an Industry Ministry official said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an internal memo to department heads this month,
management said EDF's financial situation was a serious
handicap to its development. "The disastrous structure of
EDF's balance sheet and especially our very heavy
indebtedness means that the company . . . loses credibility .
. . with the international financial community and foreign
clients," the memo said.
   EDF, which has financed most of its ambitious nuclear
program through international bond issues, had total debt
outstanding at the end of 1989 of 230 billion francs ($43.8
billion), about 1 1/2 times its annual revenue. It had a 1989
loss of 4.25 billion francs, which EDF officials blamed on
the government's refusal to allow the utility to raise rates.

   The Slug Is Bane of Gardeners

   THETIS ISLAND, British Columbia -- Donovan Saul shuffles
down the road, his eyes glued to the ground. Suddenly, he
jackknifes and scoops up from the roadside what appears to be
a gobbet of Silly Putty.
   The thing hangs limply on Mr. Saul's glove for a moment
and then plops into a pail, joining a bunch of other pale,
shapeless things slithering around in their own slime.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Saul makes his living as a professional slug catcher.
He sells them for $30 per hundred slugs, and most of his
customers are biology teachers with plans to dissect. Each
year his one-man company, Beaver Biological Supplies, ships
thousands of the slimy creatures all over the world from this
damp little coastal island. Only about 200 people live here,
but there are tens of thousands of fine, fat slugs, some
measuring a foot in length. Mr. Saul proudly compares Thetis
Island and its slugs to Bordeaux and its wines. "You can't
find slugs as big or as plentiful anywhere else," he boasts.
   There is one big open question: Why should anyone want
them? The humble slug, a gastropod land mollusk (genus
"Limax"), is no beauty. A relative of the snail, it is
spurned by the squeamish and hated by gardeners the world
over. It can eat its weight in vegetables in one sitting,
making good use of its 3,000 tiny teeth. How much demand,
after all, can there be for a repellent little animal with
four noses that prefers to live under a rock?
   Plenty, actually. Allen Gelperin, a neuroscientist at
AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., heads a team
of researchers who hope slugs can help them develop
computerized artificial intelligence. Half a dozen other labs
in the U.S. and Japan are trying to do the same thing, he
says.
   Slugs, it seems, have an unusually well-developed sense of
smell. Mr. Gelperin and his Bell Labs cronies have managed to
find the link between a slug's nose and the olfactory
receptor part of its brain. "We puff odors on the nose cells
and watch to see how the brain oscillates and changes," he
says. Carrot and mushroom smells seem to trigger the most
reaction.
   The Bell Labs team has trained slugs to shun their
favorite foods by pairing such odors with tastes slugs seem
to hate -- quinine, for instance. The scientists hope
eventually to map the slug's neural transmission patterns and
use the information thus gleaned to develop computer software
that can read stimuli much the way a police scanner reads
radio signals.
   "The advantage of the slug," says Mr. Gelperin, "is that
it is complicated enough to be interesting, but not so
complicated as to be intractable."
   Some researchers seem to find slugs downright adorable. In
her basement lab at the University of Washington in Seattle,
Ingrith Deyrup-Olsen shows off a light green, six-inch long
specimen. Gazing deeply into its eyes (which are moving about
at the tips of two protruding stalks), she wonders: "How
could anyone not love a face like that?"
   Ms. Deyrup-Olsen has a researcher's interest in the slug's
amazing ability to produce mucus. When alarmed, a slug can
secrete one-third its body weight in mucus, a substance that
feels a bit like Krazy Glue and is next to impossible to
remove. Slugs use the stuff to grease their paths, exuding it
from a gland beneath their heads and slithering along,
leaving shiny slime trails in their wake. They can even sling
the slime from trees and slide down, Tarzan style.
   Ms. Deyrup-Olsen says the slugs' glands ooze mucus at will
to protect their delicate skin. They will also slough their
protective slime shield so as to remove bacteria and other
contaminants. "Then they eat it," she says. (Table manners
aren't the slug's strongest selling point.)
   But Ms. Deyrup-Olsen believes slugs are well worth having
around. Indeed, their sliming mechanism could hold keys to
understanding such diseases as cystic fibrosis -- a fatal,
congenital disease of children -- and gastric ulcers. In
both, the body fails to properly secrete a protective mucus
shield.
   Slugs' well-known penchant for beer is something else that
fascinates researchers. Organic gardeners know to put out
containers of beer for slugs and snails to climb into and
perish. "People kept asking me which beer do they like best?"
says Whitney Cranshaw, a biologist at Colorado State
University, in Fort Collins. So, three years ago, Mr.
Cranshaw conducted a taste test that might have pleased
Anheuser-Busch Cos., but probably didn't.
   He rounded up 2,500-odd slugs and put out 16 brands of
beer in saucers. Budweiser was the slugs' favorite, 5-to-1,
according to Mr. Cranshaw's paper on the project. The
winners, as does happen, died in their beer. Anheuser-Busch
hasn't used the research findings in its advertising, Spuds
Mackenzie being a more effective spokes-animal for Bud Light
than a suicidal, alcoholic, hermaphroditic slug could be.
   The University of California at Santa Cruz, on the other
hand, has chosen the slug as its mascot. The school's 9,600
students voted overwhelmingly in 1986 to replace the sea lion
with the slug.
   Santa Cruz went a little nuts at first over its new
mascot. "The basketball team started wearing those
boing-boing antennae and creeping out on the floor on their
bellies, making cellophane slime trails," says Daniel Wood,
the school's sports director. Opponents still occasionally
show up bearing giant saltshakers (salt makes slugs shrivel
up and die a horrible death by dehydration). But the Santa
Cruz Slugs get fewer taunts these days. "Athletes kind of
like the slug's status as perpetual underdog," says Mr. Wood.
   Indeed, slugs do seem to arouse mixed emotions, especially
here in the Pacific Northwest where they abound as nowhere
else: There are said to be more than 600 of them hanging out
in the average garden. E.M. Matson Co., a Seattle concern
that sells tons of an ominously named pesticide called
"Corry's Slug and Snail Death" also does a brisk business in
T-shirts that feature a couple of likable slugs peering from
a box of slug bait.
   Theodore Roethke, the Northwest poet, once composed a
paean to the slug. The late Mr. Roethke called the creature a
"loose toe from the old life" and compared its "white skein
of spittle" to quicksilver . . . "beautiful, in its way."
   Up and down the Pacific coast, small towns exploit their
slugs by holding annual slug derbies. (A very fleet slug can
cover 50 yards in a day -- no snail's pace -- though most
races are held, for the sake of expedience, on a one-yard
course.)
   At the annual Slugfest in Guerneville, Calif., the main
attraction is a bakeoff, with a panel of judges gamely eating
their way through slug specialties supplied by local
residents. If snails are a delicacy, why not slugs? A
sampling of this year's entries: sweet and sour slugs and
slug pizza. A martini, with a slug instead of an olive (and,
of course, a slug of gin) tastes "just awful," according to
Sonoma County Sheriff Richard Michaelson, a member of the
judging panel.
   On Thetis Island, Mr. Saul is himself ambivalent about
slugs. He dispatches more than his share: Piles of
five-gallon buckets brimming with dead slugs pickling in
formaldehyde line his laboratory, and that's just a two-day
catch. But since he bought Beaver Biological four years ago
and left his job as a wildlife ranger, he says he's come to
identify with his prey.
   At the island firehouse, chums of Mr. Saul refer to the
35-year-old biotechnologist as "Slug Man." And he readily
admits to certain humane impulses: "I'm probably the only one
on the island," he says, "who swerves away when he sees a
slug on the road."

   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- P.T. Bank Duta, the private
Indonesian bank whose huge, unexplained foreign-exchange
losses came to light last week, has had its financial
position put right in surprisingly short order.
   Industry sources close to the bank said the losses were
made good with capital from Bank Duta's majority
shareholders, three foundations chaired by President Suharto.
And, as authorities had promised, Bank Duta is functioning
normally.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The central bank, Bank Indonesia, won't say how big the
foreign-exchange losses were. But the sources, who insisted
on anonymity, said losses totaled about $300 million, or
nearly double the capital of Bank Duta, one of the country's
largest private institutions.
   The in-house bailout is good news for Bank Duta's public
shareholders, who own 20% of the shares, but adds to the many
unanswered questions about the bank's troubles and the
soundness of the country's financial system. Indonesia has
hundreds of charitable foundations similar to the three that,
together, own 72% of Bank Duta. They aren't required to
publish accounts or financial statements, and little is known
of their activities.
   Bank Duta has long been considered politically
well-connected. Some bankers said the three foundations were
able on their own to raise the funds to prop up the bank,
while others said they could have received some discreet aid
from Bank Indonesia. Such a move would have allowed the
central bank to help without having to publicly violate its
oft-repeated pledge not to bail out private banks that get
into difficulties because of mismanagement.

   Your editorial significantly overstated the alleged
potential of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
   According to Ronald Reagan's pro-development Interior
Department, which likely erred on the high side but has at
least some credibility:
   -- There is only a 19% chance of finding a commercially
viable oil field below the refuge's spectacular coastal
plain.
   -- If such a field were found, the most likely output (3.2
billion barrels) would satisfy just 2% of U.S. oil demand
over its productive life.
   -- There is only one chance in 100 that a field as large
as the one at Prudhoe Bay exists there.
   How can this generation justify tearing up "America's
Serengeti" to create a sprawling industrial-pollution factory
when a mere two-mile-per-gallon increase in the efficiency of
new U.S. cars would save more crude than the oil industry
hopes to find in that unique wildlife refuge?

   You tell of the U.S. oil reserves available in Alaska and

in California.
   You will recall the pieces the Journal wrote back in the
'70s urging that the reserve be released. You pointed out
that Congress, as it usually does, would not listen to reason
and refused to act when release was definitely called for.
   The situation is even more urgent today. You would do the
nation a favor by publicizing the reserve's potential.

   BOSTON -- Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, who stood
up to Gov. Michael Dukakis in a palace coup, now is standing
down in the race for governor.
   The lieutenant governor, who was running a distant third
in next Tuesday's Democratic primary, dropped out of the race
yesterday and threw her support to former state Attorney
General Francis Bellotti. The latest polls showed Mr.
Bellotti ahead of John Silber, who is on leave from his
duties as president of Boston University.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Murphy, who never enjoyed the confidence of Gov.
Dukakis, clashed with the 1988 Democratic presidential
nominee frequently, but their dispute flared into public
attention last week as Mr. Dukakis prepared to lead a state
trade mission to Germany.
   Mr. Dukakis didn't leave Massachusetts until he felt
assured that the lieutenant governor wouldn't take advantage
of her position as acting governor by imposing her own
solution to the fiscal crisis bedeviling the state
government. But once Mr. Dukakis was safely out of
Massachusetts airspace, Ms. Murphy moved, proposing spending
cuts, salary reductions and staff firings.
   The mutiny backfired, however, and actions that Ms. Murphy
had calculated would make her appear statesmanlike instead
won her the contempt of the political establishment and the
ridicule of commentators and the public.

   CANBERRA, Australia -- The cabinet approved a plan to open
Australia's communications system to competition.
   The government said it plans to ask outsiders to submit
proposals for the formation of a new telecommunications
company that will compete with the government-owned
Australian Telecommunications Corp., known as Telecom.
Successful bidders would be granted the necessary licenses to
operate in the country and gain access to Australia's
existing telephone network.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, Telecom, which currently has a monopoly
on Australia's domestic telephone service, will merge with
OTC Ltd., the government's international telecommunications
concern.
   The moves are part of a government effort to partly
privatize certain state-owned businesses, including its
airlines, to repay debt, increase competition, and make the
industries more efficient.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said that as part of the plan the
new telecommunications company would acquire Aussat Pty.
Ltd., a government-owned satellite-services concern. "Both
network operators will compete internationally as well as
domestically," Mr. Hawke said. "We will ensure that the new
network shares Telecom's network at a price Telecom would
charge itself."
   Kim Beazley, Minister for Transport and Communications,
said that "notionally" the new telecommunications operator
could start as a 100% foreign-owned concern. But companies
tendering to set up the new network would be "stupid" to
propose 100% foreign ownership, he added.
   The majority of the new operator ultimately should be
Australian-owned, Mr. Beazley said. He wasn't specific on
when it must have a majority of Australian shareholders.
"That is to be worked out through the tender process," Mr.
Beazley said.
   Industry analysts believe that foreign companies
interested in taking a stake in a new Australian
telecommunications company include Bell Atlantic Corp. and
American Information Technologies Corp. (Ameritech), which
acquired Telecom Corp. of New Zealand earlier this year, MCI
Corp., Bell Canada Enterprises Inc., Cable &amp; Wireless PLC,
British Telecommunications PLC and Racal Telecom PLC.
   BellSouth Corp. of the U.S. also said yesterday that it is
interested in entering Australia's telecommunications
industry and could invest three billion (US$2.47 billion) to
four billion Austrialian dollars over several years in a
network competitor if it wins the tender.
   Ross Ramsey, director of corporate development for
BellSouth, said his company will tender for Aussat with
Australian consortium partners.
   Mr. Beazley said foreign telecommunications companies are
showing "an enormous amount" of interest in taking part in
the proposed new Australian network.
   Foreign expertise is needed to establish competition to
the current monopoly telephone operator, the minister said in
a television interview. But "all those who anticipate coming
into this country anticipate also that they're going to be,
in the end, a minority partner," he said.
   Mr. Beazley said the new company will both plug into the
existing Telecom network and develop its own network.
   British Telecom said in a statement late yesterday it is
interested in competing in Australia.
   Peter Hutton, managing director of British Telecom
Australia Pty. Ltd., said the extent of British Telecom's
interest will depend on "the rules of the game, such as the
regulatory framework, the type of competition and the
opportunities open to a foreign investor."
   Australian companies that have been mentioned as possible
members of consortiums to establish the new concern include
transportation companies TNT Ltd. and Brambles Industries
Ltd., cable maker Pacific Dunlop Ltd., steel maker Broken
Hill Proprietary Co. and Exicom Ltd., a maker of
telecommunications products.

   Gulf Crisis Sends
   Gold Tumbling
   And Oil Rising

   The Persian Gulf crisis continued to dominate trading in
the oil and gold pits yesterday, sending the price of gold
down and the price of oil on a roller-coaster ride that ended
on an upswing.
   Both commodities initially tumbled as traders digested
news from the Helsinki, Finland, summit. Although the Soviet
Union at that meeting threw its support behind the U.S.
stance against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, it failed to
pledge military support to the effort. Without that extra
military might, a protracted stand-off seemed to traders to
be more likely than a war that might disrupt the flow of oil
from the Middle East. As a result, war jitters evaporated
again for the moment and along with them some of the war
premium buoying prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also putting early pressure on prices was an offer by
Saddam Hussein to provide free oil to Third World countries
starved for oil as a result of the Iraq-Kuwait embargo. But
the offer was later discounted by traders who concluded that
few nations would risk sending tankers to Iraq to pick up oil
in violation of the embargo.
   Then late in the trading day, after the close of the gold
market, rumors of new Middle East troop movements caused oil
prices to snap upward. Traders began buying oil contracts on
unconfirmed reports that Iraqi soldiers might be massing on
the Jordanian border -- a move that they reasoned could bring
Israel into conflict with Iraq since Jordan is all that
separates the two countries.
   In Washington, a Pentagon official said the U.S. hasn't
seen any signs of threatening Iraqi troop movements near
Jordan. The official said some Iraqi troops may have been
moved during training exercises, though.
   The price for crude for delivery during October jumped by
$1.26 to $31.30 a barrel, climbing almost as much as it had
fallen during earlier trading. Heating oil and gasoline
prices rose as well.
   Volatility appeared to be the dominant trading feature,
showing "how precariously balanced the oil market is," said
Lawrence Goldstein, president of Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.
   Although the market focused mostly on Middle East action,
product prices also received some support from remarks made
by Calvin Kent, head of the Energy Department's Energy
Information Administration. He told a congressional hearing
in Washington that gasoline stocks were only 5.9 million
barrels above minimum operating inventory levels. If and when
that level is reached, there could be shortages of gasoline,
he told the lawmakers.
   Because gold trading ended just as the most volatile
rumors were surfacing, those prices missed most of the rally
that saw oil prices rebound.
   Gold for December delivery ended with a loss of $11.20 an
ounce at $384.80, after swinging over a $10 range. December
contracts were under pressure from the start in reaction to
the Helsinki summit, but some demand for contracts developed
because Saddam Hussein was scheduled to make a television
speech at 11:00 a.m. EDT. As a consequence, the December
contract rose to $391.60 an ounce, which was $4.40 below
Friday's close.
   But according to analysts, there was none of the
belligerency they feared in the Iraqi leader's statement and
December plunged to its low of the day of $381.60 an ounce.
   Peter Cardillo, director of futures research for Jesup
Josephthal, New York, observed that the Helsinki conference,
a strong dollar and weakness in platinum prices all
contributed to the price plunge in gold, which at its low was
showing a loss of $14.40 an ounce.
   The dollar rose against all foreign currencies except the
yen. Prices of all platinum contracts plunged their daily
permissible limit of $25 an ounce and then recovered only
slightly with the October contract settling at $457.50 an
ounce.
   About 20 minutes before trading in precious metals ended,
the oil rebound began, carrying gold with it. But gold
traders in the spot market apparently were unconvinced by the
advance in oil prices because gold in the noncontract market
didn't continue to climb.
   Oil traders and analysts predict that oil prices will
likely decline today unless the validity of rumors that drove
yesterday's market is confirmed.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices rallied in heavy
trading yesterday on a forecast of cold weather and rumors of
international events. "These markets are just very nervous
for any kind of news," said Daniel Basse, director of market
research for AgResource Co., Chicago. "This kind of price
movement is unusual just before harvest." Traders continued
to speculate that the U.S. may offer an aid package to the
Soviet Union for purchase of U.S. commodities, possibly
including wheat, soybean meal and corn. The prevailing rumor
was that President Bush may announce such a package when he
addresses Congress tonight. Any such increase in demand for
grain is likely to push futures prices higher. Meanwhile, one
Chicago weather forecaster's prediction of chilly weather and
a possible frost this weekend in the upper Midwest also
served to drive prices higher. The soybean crop is still
vulnerable and poor weather could reduce yields, analysts
said.
   A third factor exerting upward pressure on prices
yesterday was rumored movement of Iraqi troops along the
Jordanian border. Speculation that Iraq may invade Jordan
caused crude oil prices to rise sharply. That raised
inflationary concerns for grains, the production of which is
heavily dependent on petroleum products.
   A report released after the close of trading yesterday
showed a 6% reduction in the amount of soybeans in the
current crop thought to be in good condition, lending
credibility to previous worries that hot weather in the
Mississippi Delta growing region might damage the crop there.
The report may push futures prices higher today. In addition,
an important U.S. Agriculture Department crop production
report is due out after trading tomorrow. Analysts said that
report would be very closely watched.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices ended lower after fluctuating
widely. The most active December contract settled at 72.06
cents a pound, down 0.88 cent, after trading over a range of
1.55 cents. The soonest-to-expire October contract was off
1.08 cents to 72.58 cents, with a trading range of 1.40
cents. Selling developed in early trading following a report
that indicated yields of cotton being harvested in southern
Mississippi, a major cotton-growing state, were better than
expected, an analyst said. The crop had experienced a
prolonged drought during the growing season and there had
been concern about reduced production, he said. As prices
reached their day's lows, traders who had sold short began
buying back contracts to offset their positions. That buying
touched off a strong rally, which helped to partly recover
the early losses, according to the analyst.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices declined. The most actively traded
December contract ended with a loss of 2.05 cents a pound at
$1.2830. Some traders decided to take profits following
Friday's rally of more than seven cents a pound on concern
over production problems in various areas of the world, an
analyst said. A comment in Paris by the Peruvian energy and
mining minister that he expected the strike at Minero Peru
mine in Peru to end this week was also a price-depressing
factor, the analyst said. The Peruvian strike entered its
fourth week yesterday. A dealer noted that despite the
setback in futures, prices of the spot or soonest-to-expire
contracts on both the Commodity Exchange in New York and the
London Metal Exchange widened to greater premiums over more
deferred contracts. This action, he said, reflected a
continuing tightness of supplies of copper for delivery
against futures on the exchanges.

   GM, UAW Bargainers Are Still Far Apart
   Over the Talks' Top Issue of Job Security

   DETROIT -- With four days to go until a strike deadline,
bargainers for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto
Workers union are still far apart on the top issue in the
talks -- job security for union members.
   But both sides say they're optimistic they can reach an
agreement by the Friday night deadline, despite the
differences over job guarantees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   UAW officials want GM to promise that the company's
310,000 UAW workers will be employed for all but a specific
number of weeks per year. The requirement, which would allow
the company to close plants temporarily based on market
demand, would discourage the auto maker from moving
production work outside the country or to non-union plants.
The requirement is similar to the agreement that the UAW
reached with Tenneco Inc.'s J.I. Case division, a Wisconsin
farm-equipment maker.
   GM officials, however, say they can't match the terms at
J.I. Case because the auto maker needs to reduce its North
American work force to cut costs. J.I. Case agreed to its job
security provisions when its work force was at a historic
low, GM officials say.
   GM bargainers have indicated they might offer greater job
security to the 280,000 UAW members currently working for the
company. But that doesn't include some 30,000 now laid off
indefinitely. Instead, GM has indicated it might be willing
to boost compensation for those now laid off, some of whom
receive payments from GM in addition to regular government
unemployment benefits.
   A key element in the discussions will be the current
requirement that GM replace one of every two workers who
retire or quit. The UAW wants to keep this provision in the
contract. GM wants it eliminated to speed downsizing efforts.
The company also is offering to sweeten pensions to encourage
older workers to retire.
   Officials on both sides say the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
has cast a shadow over the talks. The situation has
intensified concerns about a broad economic downturn, and a
worsening of the Big Three auto makers sales slump. "It's had
a very sobering effect on negotiations," said a GM official
close to the talks.
   Still, UAW and GM officials agree the talks until now have
gone better than expected. The two sides quickly agreed to
language regarding basic health and safety issues. Bargainers
aren't expecting much trouble over basic wage and benefit
issues, either.
   However, these matters remain secondary to job security
and pensions. Said one GM official: "If we have a strike,
everyone will know what it's about."

   BRITISH TRIAL

   The British shipping company P&amp;O European Ferries and
seven former employees denied manslaughter charges at the
start of their trial stemming from a ferry disaster that
killed 193 people.
   The trial follows a police investigation into the
capsizing of the ferry Herald of Free Enterprise as it left
the Belgian port of Zeebrugge March 6, 1987. The company,
three officials and four crew members are accused of
unlawfully killing just one passenger, Alison Joy Gaillard,
27, selected to represent those who died.
   The seven men and the company pleaded not guilty to the
charges.
   Manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment; the company faces an unlimited fine if found
guilty. The trial could last up to five months.
                                                                                                       

   PORTUGUESE AIR FARES UP
                                                                                                       

   The Portuguese government increased domestic air fares by
some 10% yesterday, citing rising oil prices. A one-way
economy fare between Lisbon and the southern resort of Faro
rose 9.5%, to 10,400 escudos (about $75). Economy rates
between the capital and the northern city of Oporto rose by
the same margin to 11,500 escudos. Air fares between mainland
Portugal and the Atlantic islands of Madeira and the Azores
were unchanged.
                                                                                                       

   INDONESIAN PETROCHEMICALS
                                                                                                       

   A new Indonesian company, PT Chandra Asri, signed an
agreement to invest $2.4 billion in a complex to produce
olefins, which are petrochemical byproducts used in making
plastics. The signing increases doubts that a previously
proposed $1.7 billion olefins project involving Royal
Dutch/Shell Group and Indonesia's Bimantara Citra Group will
go ahead. Shell and its Indonesian partners haven't been able
to agree on shareholding arrangements. Analysts said that if
the Shell-Bimantara deal falls through, either Bimantara or
its chairman, Bambang Trihatmodjo, a son of President
Suharto, could play an equity or other role in the Chandra
Asri development.
                                                                                                       

   PIZZA HUTS FOR MOSCOW, BEIJING
                                                                                                       

   With the Soviet Union's first two Pizza Huts scheduled to
open in Moscow today, China's first Pizza Hut opened
yesterday in Beijing and served 200 pizzas to an
invitation-only crowd of Chinese and foreigners before
running out of dough. In the future, the two-story, 180-seat
restaurant expects to serve about 285 pizzas daily, mainly to
foreign tourists and foreign residents of Beijing. But the
company also hopes to attract Chinese customers, not yet used
to pizza.
                                                                                                       

   SPECULATION IN BRAZIL
                                                                                                       

   Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello blamed
speculators for high prices and called for a "national
dialogue" to reduce inflation. "High prices still exist in
some sectors, due to a perverse combination of inflationary
memory and speculation," Mr. Collor said in a nationally
broadcast speech. "Save. Buy only essentials. Haggle," he
urged. When Mr. Collor took office in March, prices were
rising more than 80% a month; in August, monthly inflation
was 10.5%.

   Sanyo Electric Co. said it would start marketing next
April in Japan selected consumer electric products made by
Siemens AG of West Germany. Officials of the Japanese company
said Sanyo would sell four Siemens products -- refrigerators,
dishwashers, washing machines and stoves -- as part of its
system kitchens. The marketing tie-up will help Siemens
establish a toehold in Japan while at the same time help
Sanyo bolster sales of its system kitchens by incorporating
the German-made equipment, which Sanyo officials say is in
strong demand in Japan.

   South Korean companies are beginning to use Soviet
technology for commercial applications.
   Samil Pharmaceutical Co., a midsized South Korean medicine
company, plans to introduce by the end of this year in South
Korea a patented Soviet technology for measuring cholesterol.
An official at Samsung Co., the Korean agent for
Licensintorg, a Soviet government agency handling technology
trade with foreign companies, said the Samil deal is the
first of about 15 that combine Soviet technology with South
Korean manufacturing.
   Licensintorg took hundreds of patented Soviet technologies
to South Korea for commercial applications during a Soviet
trade show in Seoul earlier this year.
   The Soviet Union and South Korea are expected to establish
formal diplomatic relations within two months, Seoul's state
radio said yesterday.

   Chinese Vice President Wang Zhen marked National Teachers'
Day yesterday with a call to resist foreign and domestic
plots to implant democracy in China. The People's Daily
newspaper carried a letter written by Mr. Wang calling on
primary and middle-school teachers to improve the "quality of
political thinking" by teaching Marxism and Maoist thought. .
. . South Korea's Constitution Court, which rules on the
constitutionality of laws, determined yesterday that the
country's prohibition of adultery is constitutional. "It is
imperative that adultery remain outlawed to protect the
existing marital system and harmonious family life and
prevent social harms that might be caused by it," the ruling
said.

   An estimated three million middle managers lost their jobs
in the 1980s, casualties of corporate America's thinning-down
regimen. Their experiences provide fresh ranks of displaced
managers with some clue of what awaits them.
   After some trying times, the pink-slippers of the '80s
generally have reconciled themselves to their dismissals and
emerged happier, if worse off financially. Many landed jobs,
often at smaller employers. Some became business owners
themselves. Others are semi-retired, pursuing hobbies or
sideline businesses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That, at least, is what is discerned by revisiting
corporate managers who lost their jobs in the past eight
years and some of whom talked earlier with this newspaper.
Since their corporate dismissals, one left the Connecticut
home he loved for a job in the Midwest. Another, laid off
from a chemical company in 1982, recalls "reeling like a
punch-drunk fighter" from the pressures of rejection,
mounting bills and the absence of corporate health insurance
to help care for severely ill family members.
   Here are the stories of five of the managers. Most
striking is that all of them express a common sentiment: If
offered their old jobs back, they would turn them down.
Adversity has changed these people, they say, mainly by
making them more independent. Many place increased value on
family, friends and free time. And those on their own cite a
pride in personal accomplishment that corporate life didn't
give them.
                                                                                                       

   THE DARKNESS LIFTED
                                                                                                       

   Joseph Taylor considers the past three years "a complete
burnout -- like coming down the hill on the seat of my pants.
There was nothing between me and the ground."
   In 1987, he lost his managerial job with a Shell Oil Co.
unit in New York when that company moved to Texas. He
expected to get a new position quickly, and at a higher
annual salary than the $43,000 he had been earning. It didn't
happen. This newspaper chronicled his first year out of work,
including 2,500 phone calls to land a new job and stints at
selling cars and insurance. "A long, dark, road," he called
it then.
   Things got even darker. His next job, selling computers in
a mall, turned sour. "At one point I woke up and said, `This
is all bull. I might as well be selling ladies' underwear.'
It didn't matter how much I knew about computers." Mr.
Taylor, who lives in Howell, N.J., began consulting part time
and sending out more resumes. He mailed 1,000 last year; his
file of rejection letters is two inches thick. Though his
wife returned to work and he dipped into his son's college
fund, unpaid bills piled up. Bankruptcy loomed.
   But last year, Mr. Taylor's part-time consulting work
turned a corner. His reputation spread, and small businesses
sought his services setting up personal-computer systems. Two
months ago, one client, a small brokerage house, hired him
full time. "It's a very small company, but I'm doing
something I really enjoy," he says. Financially, the
49-year-old Mr. Taylor says, "I'm worse off than I was" at
Shell. But he believes he has come out ahead personally.
"There's been a change in my sense of values," he says.
"Being with my family and enjoying myself is more important
than ever. Having all this time on my hands, I found the time
for them."
                                                                                                       

   `LIVING WITH LESS FEAR'
                                                                                                       

   Rock music blares from a packing room in a pink brick
warehouse in Mount Vernon, N.Y., as a half-dozen young men
slide cartons into storage bins. A tangle of computer
equipment spits out orders, while workers paste mailing
labels on fliers.
   For Peter Greenhill, this is a long way from Rogers &amp;
Cowan, the New York public-relations agency that dumped him
in a reorganization six years ago. His new business is
baseball cards; the company for which he works, New York Card
Co., expects $7 million in sales this year.
   His new boss -- in a way -- is his 18-year-old son, David.
Mr. Greenhill, 52, handles finances, advertising and
administration. His wife, a teacher, works the computers
after school. But it's David, who started the business when
he was 13 to help the family through hard times, who decides
what cards to buy and sell. "He's got the knack," says his
father.
   No one thought it would turn out this way. But Mr.
Greenhill's $75,000-a-year job proved impossible to replace.
Contacts evaporated; resumes he sent out went unanswered.
After four years without full-time work, he even applied for
$25,000-a-year positions, but to no avail. By 1988, with
"absolutely no offers whatsoever" on the horizon, Mr.
Greenhill and his family faced the prospect of selling their
condominium and moving.
   But David, meanwhile, had been using his paper route money
to buy and sell baseball cards. His hobby grew. The family
took phone orders at home and packed orders on the kitchen
floor.
   Today, the business has a 3,000-square-foot warehouse,
seven full-time employees and plans to double its floor space
and staff by year end. The Greenhills are reinvesting their
money in the business, so the family still isn't financially
secure. But, Mr. Greenhill says, "we are living with less
fear."
   Would he return to his old profession? "No way," he says.
He expresses bitterness about his experiences while jobless.
"Friends turned out to be acquaintances," he says. "I'm
disappointed in the industry."
                                                                                                       

   FINDING A FOCUS
                                                                                                       

   Barbara Evans, a public affairs manager for American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., lived with corporate cutbacks for
many years, helping notify colleagues that their jobs were
being eliminated, before her own job was eliminated a year
ago. She fantasized about becoming an entrepreneur -- perhaps
running a wine and cheese shop.
   But when she left AT&amp;T, she didn't turn shopkeeper.
Instead, Ms. Evans, 55 and long divorced, operates a
corporate communications and market research company,
marketing the skills she acquired in a 31-year career there
and at the Bell companies. She invested about $25,000 in the
business and expects it to subsidize her life style. With her
pension, she says, "I could live, but I wouldn't be enjoying
all the super things {New York} provides," such as the
theater and ballet.
   The hardest task has been finding a focus for her
business. "Within the Bell system, the emphasis was always on
getting an experience in a lot of different chairs so you
could get promoted to supervise those chairs." Today, she
says, "when someone asks you what you do, it's tough to say."
   Selling, too, has been difficult. "I've always been on the
other side of the desk, and I was uncomfortable with the
calling and proposing." There's a "little bit of stage
fright," she says.
   But her corporate past has advantages. One of the biggest
is a huge network of friends and contacts she can tap to find
artists, film makers, focus-group leaders and researchers to
help complete her projects.
   "I'm pleased that what I am selling is me and my
experience and my brains," Ms. Evans says, adding that she
prefers being on her own.
                                                                                                       

   FROM PERSONNEL TO PERFORMING
                                                                                                       

   For Thomas McLaughlin, losing his job meant finding
himself. After a long career as a human-resources
administrator at Bethlehem Steel Corp., he is now a
performer, doing television commercials, voice-overs for
radio commercials and narrations.
   Mr. McLaughlin, 48, doesn't make much money, but says that
doesn't matter. "I'm delighted with the direction I took," he
says. "I thoroughly enjoy what I am doing."
   It all began with the steel-industry crisis nearly a
decade ago. For four years, Mr. McLaughlin helped Bethlehem
Steel Corp. shed jobs to cut costs. Then in 1985, he found an
additional saving: his own job, which staff cutbacks around
him had rendered unnecessary. He looked for a human-resources
position elsewhere, but a job counselor, noting his basso
profundo, suggested performing.
   Today, he lives in Hellertown, Pa., on "less than half" of
his $50,000-plus Bethlehem salary, mostly from his pension.
After five years, his performance business is barely
profitable, but in years ahead he expects it to pay for
"goodies." Divorced and with a grown child, he had lived
frugally for years. One sacrifice, though, was his
country-club membership.
   Bethlehem Steel's outlook has improved since he left. But
he has no desire to return. "To know you have done something
in a professional manner -- that's the kind of thing that now
defines success for me," he says. When a client calls back
with more work, "it's an ego trip." In a corporate job, "what
you do is what people expect you to do," he says.
   What's more, working just three days a week, he revels in
his free time. "I have a thousand hobbies, a country house
that requires a great deal of maintenance. I have time to
pick berries and make wine. I play tennis two or three times
a week, and I have time to spend two or three hours cooking."
                                                                                                       

   `LEAVE THE DOORS OPEN'
                                                                                                       

   Stanley Collins was the quintessential company man. "I
grew up with big companies," he says. "I liked the companies
I worked for. I liked doing what I was doing." Indeed, he
might still be a manager at Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. if
a 1987 takeover attempt by Wickes Cos. hadn't pushed
Owens-Corning to pare nearly half its employees.
   Today, he's the quintessential entrepreneur. A public
relations and video production business that he started with
a partner three years ago in Toledo, Ohio, now has eight
employees. It has branched out far beyond its original
client, Owens-Corning, which now represents just 10% to 15%
of its business.
   At Owens-Corning, he worked 40 hours a week; at his own
business, it's a 60-hour week. "It's a lot of work, but it's
fun." The company will bill about $500,000 this year. Mr.
Collins, 57, says he's financially better off than he would
have been at Owens-Corning: "Unless they {had} made me
president."
   And he doesn't think his former corporate colleagues are
as happy as he is. "Part of the problem for people who remain
is that it's a different business than the one they grew up
with. Their jobs are different, and they're doing a lot more
work."
   His advice for other middle managers facing the loss of
their jobs: "You have to leave all the doors open. Don't be
afraid to open a new door. You'd be really surprised at where
it takes you."

   Increased parental control of British schools, as
discussed by David Brooks (editorial page, July 26), is
anything but the unalloyed good news it seems to be.
   The crucial factor in education is curriculum. In the name
of efficiency, a standardized curriculum is reportedly being
promoted in British schools. The state, not parents, will
decide this "standard" curriculum.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the U.S., as in England, the "choice" of school
buildings now being offered only disarms parents and makes
them foolishly think they are in charge of their children's
education. Instead of parents choosing their children's
curriculum, America's future curriculum will be shaped by
nongovernmental agencies and foundations. They will
underwrite national "achievement" tests, most probably in
concert with government-related agencies such as the National
Assessment of Educational Progress. These tests will define
and drive future curriculum in American schools.
   If parents in American and British schools promoting
"choice" demanded that laws be passed to confirm their right
to choose all textbooks and all tests in such "choice"
schools, they would be surprised at how quickly the illusion
of "choice" would fade like fog before the sun.

   WASHINGTON -- A federal court upheld the authority of the
Office of Thrift Supervision to impose new capital
requirements on a thrift, in a case that temporarily put the
entire savings-and-loan bailout on hold.
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth dismissed six counts in
the suit filed by Olympic Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association,
Berwyn, Ill., ruling that he has no jurisdiction to prevent
federal regulators from enforcing capital standards
established by the S&amp;L cleanup law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier this year, the thrift won a ruling that had the
effect of nullifying actions taken by the previous top thrift
regulator, on the grounds that he hadn't been appointed
properly. The ruling was later overturned by an appellate
court, and Olympic pursued its court case on other grounds.
   In his decision issued late last week, Judge Lamberth said
he is still considering two other counts, in which Olympic
Federal argued that it didn't receive sufficient notice of
the new capital requirements and that the regulators hadn't
considered its request for federal assistance. Judge Lamberth
earlier denied Olympic Federal's request for a temporary
restraining order on those grounds.
   Meanwhile, Timothy Ryan, director of the thrift office,
predicted that the agency would be vindicated in its
contentious takeover of Franklin Savings Association, Ottawa,
Kan., with $11 billion in assets. In a complex case revolving
around how federal regulators accounted for Franklin's
losses, a federal court ruled that the government seizure was
improper. The government is appealing the decision.
   Mr. Ryan said that he reviewed the thrift office actions,
which were launched prior to his taking his post. "I came to
the very firm conclusion that the institution, Franklin, is
appropriately in the Resolution Trust Corp.," he said. The
RTC acts as the liquidator of government-seized thrifts. He
contended that Franklin's losses presented an "extraordinary
risk" to the deposit insurance fund.

   Your Aug. 22 editorial on South Africa is right on the
mark. Lebanon's factionalism is a far better analog for
understanding South Africa than is America's black
civil-rights movement. Seven years of living in Southern
Africa brought me to use the analogy of America's Indian
tribes similarly to make the dynamics comprehensible to my
American friends inexperienced in African political
realities.
   The attempts of black American politicos to exploit Nelson
Mandela for domestic political purposes have been shameful
but also somewhat burlesque. The realities of South Africa
are now beginning to overwhelm the artificial images
constructed for factional advantage in the U.S. and in
support of African National Congress hopes that America might
pull the rug from under the Boer government so that the ANC
could simply move into office -- a scenario perhaps modeled
on the perception of America's performance in Vietnam.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Journal's somewhat contradictory role in helping
construct the artificial images should not be overlooked.
Despite its very accurate appraisals on the editorial page,
the Journal's front-page reporting often reflects the "civil
rights" stance properly decried as misleading by the editors.
   With such mixed signals emanating from the Journal, the
reader must choose between the realities of the "news" and
those of the "opinions." I personally opt for the opinion
page, which more nearly coincides with my own experience, but
it detracts from the Journal's reputation for consistent
realism that it does not speak here with one voice.

   Columbia S&amp;L's
   Plan to Sell Junk
   Bonds Rejected

   Federal regulators rejected Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association's plan for unloading its $2.9 billion junk-bond
portfolio, increasing the likelihood that the government will
eventually take over the thrift.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said it "cannot approve"
the complex transaction, under which Columbia was to sell its
junk bonds to Gordon America L.P., a partnership affiliated
with Toronto-based Gordon Investment Corp. The deal
apparently foundered on unusual and generous financing
provisions that would have left the government on the hook
for huge losses if the bonds, which have lost about $1
billion of value in recent months, withered further.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gordon America had agreed to pay $3 billion for the
portfolio, a slight premium that surprised many analysts and
investment bankers given the tumult in the junk market of
late. However, the terms included 90% financing, to be
provided by Columbia on a so-called non-recourse basis. That
meant that Gordon America could walk away from the
transaction if additional losses exceeded 10%, and Columbia
would have had to buy the bonds back. That would instantly
doom Columbia, which is already insolvent by $352.2 million
as of June 30, and make its failure even more costly for the
government than it would be now.
   The financing method had been under attack from some
quarters since the deal was disclosed July 25 and was certain
to come under Congressional scrutiny. The OTS said terms of
the financing "raised a signficant legal issue of compliance"
with provisions of the thrift bailout bill passed in August
1988, which required thrifts to divest their junk-bond
holdings. Under the financing terms, Columbia could have
wound up having to take back the bonds, in contravention of
that provision.
   Furthermore, the OTS said that Columbia might fail even if
the transaction went through, resulting in the government
holding the notes financing the junk-bond sale. The OTS said
the government "could be required to disaffirm the proposed
financing arrangement" under those circumstances.
   The OTS added that no all-cash bids had been sought during
Columbia's search for a buyer for the portfolio and that
Columbia didn't consider any bids that would have given the
thrift a share of any future gains in the portfolio.
Consequently, the OTS said it "could not be confident the
bidding process had produced the best ultimate value for the
portfolio."
   The proposal had been a longshot from the start. It became
even more wobbly following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait -- the
economic uncertainty provoked by the Gulf crisis prompted one
of the partnership's major financial backers, companies
controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Kashing, to reconsider
their role. Richard Li, son of the Hong Kong tycoon, said on
Aug. 30 that his family might withdraw from the deal.
   Beyond that, even if the transaction went through,
Columbia still would have had to raise some $300 million to
$400 million to meet new capital requirements. Edward G.
Harshfield, who took over as chief executive of Columbia
after the architect of the junk-bond portfolio, Thomas
Spiegel, stepped down in December, had hoped to raise some
$200 million through the sale of other securities to help
narrow the capital deficit. Still, many industry analysts and
investment bankers considered a government takeover of
Columbia likely, even if the deal had gone through.
   Mr. Spiegel has since been accused of looting Columbia and
faces federal civil charges. The government is seeking at
least $24 million in restitution and penalties from Mr.
Spiegel.
   Mr. Harshfield said in a written statement yesterday that
Columbia would try to restructure the deal, but the rejection
of non-recourse financing limits Columbia's options. Without
such financing, analysts believe Columbia would have to write
down the bonds an additional 10% to 15%, increasing the
thrift's negative net worth. And few investors are expected
to have much interest in paying cash for the portfolio, even
after further markdowns.
   For the six months ended June 30, Columbia had a loss of
$429.9 million, or $21.39 a share.

   Japan's Plan to Sell More NTT Shares
   In Privatization Put Off for Second Year

<LP>
   TOKYO -- Government officials have again punched the hold
button on investors who want to buy a stake in the world's
biggest telecommunications company, Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone Corp.
   With Tokyo stock prices down nearly 40% since January and
NTT shareholders raising a ruckus, officials at Japan's
powerful Ministry of Finance confirmed what market analysts
here have been predicting for weeks: For the second year in a
row, the government will postpone plans to sell nearly two
million state-owned shares of NTT to private investors as
part of a continuing privatization program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ministry officials weren't available to comment, but
issued this statement late Monday afternoon: "Further
{government} sales of NTT shares could trigger more declines
in NTT stock prices and could have a bad influence on the
stock market."
   The ministry still owns about two-thirds of the 15.6
million NTT shares outstanding; it is required by law to hold
at least one-third, but it would like to sell as many shares
as legally possible to use the proceeds to reduce the
government's debt.
   Rumors of the announcement had cheered some investors. NTT
shares, the most expensive on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
closed Monday at 881,000 yen ($6,285.94), up 21,000 yen. But
most analysts said the move indicates the telecommunications
conglomerate's distress.
   "It's absolutely predictable," Michael Jeremy, an analyst
at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd., said of the ministry's
move. "This company is in just as much difficulty as it was
last year at this time." And John Baldwin, an analyst at
Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd., said, "We took it as a
foregone conclusion."
   Foreigners may buy and sell NTT shares but can't receive
their dividends.
   Perhaps no other company listed on the Tokyo exchange has
proved as disappointing to Japanese investors as NTT, the
world's most heavily capitalized company. The public clamored
to own the stock after plans to privatize NTT were announced
in 1985. The press of eager investors was so great at the
first public auction of NTT shares in 1986 that the
government instituted a lottery to thin the ranks of bidders.
Individual investors snapped up the shares, assured by
enthusiastic Japanese brokers that it was impossible to lose
on NTT stock, because the biggest holder, the Finance
Ministry, would never allow its price to drop.
   And at first, the predictions came true: By April 1988,
the price of NTT shares -- issued at a par value of 50,000
yen -- soared to a high of 3.18 million yen. But the price
declined relentlessly in the months that followed, as the
government continued to sell additional shares, even as
investors started to discover that NTT's financial prospects
weren't as rosy as anticipated. When the Finance Ministry
sold an additional 1.95 million shares in 1989, the price had
dropped to 1.19 million yen.
   Jeffrey Zavattero, an analyst at Jardine Fleming, said he
expects NTT's operating profit in the year ending next March
to contract to 550 million yen from 665 million yen in fiscal
1990.
   NTT faces competitive pressures in its most profitable
business, long distance. As a regulated monopoly, NTT must
maintain unprofitable local telephone businesses. It also is
caught in a cross fire between three regulatory agencies,
each of which has a different agenda for the company.

   WASHINGTON -- On Aug. 7, Ira Goldman, a top aide to Sen.
Pete Wilson, helped arrange for motion-picture czar Jack
Valenti and other Hollywood executives to meet with William
Barr, the Justice Department's newly installed deputy
attorney general.
   The meeting -- which Mr. Goldman not only helped set up
but also attended lest the Justice Department lose sight of
his boss's extraordinary interest in the matter -- went well
for the Hollywood lobby.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It resulted in a re-evaluation of a department legal
position that would hurt the movie industry's battle against
the television networks to keep sole control of $3 billion a
year in television rerun sales.
   Thursday evening, the movie chieftains are rewarding Mr.
Goldman's boss, Sen. Wilson, handsomely for efforts on their
behalf. A Who's Who of Hollywood bigwigs will assemble at the
Bel Air home of Paramount Pictures Corp. Chairman Frank
Mancuso to raise money for Sen. Wilson's hotly contested
campaign for governor of California.
   The $1,000-a-couple cocktail reception could fatten the
Republican gubernatorial candidate's coffers by $250,000 or
more, according to several experienced Hollywood
fund-raisers.
   Among the 25 co-sponsors listed on the invitation: Walt
Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner, Warner Bros. Inc.
Chairman Robert Daly, MCA Inc. President Sidney Sheinberg,
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. Co-Chairman Peter Guber,
MGM/UA Communications Co. Chairman Kirk Kerkorian,
independent producer Stephen J. Cannell, and Mr. Valenti,
president of the powerful Motion Picture Association of
America.
   Sen. Wilson, who didn't respond to repeated inquiries
about the juxtaposition of the department meeting and the
fund-raiser, has long had a close relationship with the
motion-picture industry. Mr. Goldman says there is
"absolutely no connection" between the meeting and the
fund-raiser. "It's incredible that anyone would even suggest
that," he adds.
   But others say the meeting and subsequent fund-raiser are
a flagrant example of the way special-interest donors get
special favors and access from the lawmakers to whom they
contribute. "This is as bold a play for the special interests
that support a campaign that could possibly be made,"
contends Ellen Miller of the Center for Responsive Politics
in Washington.
   In the wake of the S&amp;L debacle, serious questions have
been raised about lawmakers' intervening for special-interest
constituents or financial supporters. There is often a thin
line between legitimate constituent representation and a quid
pro quo.
   Hollywood's Messrs. Valenti and Daly, who are among those
throwing Sen. Wilson's fund-raising bash, accompanied Mr.
Goldman to the meeting at the Justice Department. The meeting
came after the Justice Department had already staked out an
initial position against Hollywood on an arcane set of
regulations known as the Financial Interest and Syndication
Rules.
   Preservation of the rules, adopted by the Federal
Communications Commission two decades ago, is crucial to the
movie industry because they bar the television networks from
syndicating shows or sharing in the profits of hit television
series when reruns are sold to local TV stations. Most of
these series are produced by the major motion-picture
studios.
   In June, the department's antitrust chief, James Rill,
concluded in 37 pages of legal comments that the rules should
be eliminated, unless the FCC finds they protect the public
interest. Next year the FCC is expected to decide the issue,
which has pitted an alliance of major Hollywood studios and
independent producers against the television networks in a
decade-long lobbying war.
   Although the Justice Department took a similar stance in
1983, the Rill comments were a blow to Hollywood lobbyists,
who say the rules protect the producers and creators of
television shows from monopolistic practices of the TV
networks. With help from Sen. Wilson and his counsel, Mr.
Goldman, the motion-picture industry went over Mr. Rill's
head and appealed to the department's newly installed deputy
attorney general, Mr. Barr.
   Sen. Wilson began his lobbying of Mr. Barr even before he
was confirmed as deputy attorney general. "He made the
producers' case" during one of the Justice official's
courtesy calls on senators during the confirmation process,
recalls Mr. Barr. "I told him I would keep an open mind."
   Mr. Rill had issued his comments on June 14, before Mr.
Barr was confirmed. After the comments were released, Sen.
Wilson continued to lobby Mr. Barr by telephone. Then came
the Aug. 7 meeting with Mr. Goldman, Mr. Valenti, Mr. Daly
and a few other movie-industry representatives.
   Responding to the movie studios' entreaties, Mr. Barr
agreed to review the massive record in the case before
issuing further filings to the FCC. Since Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh is recused in the matter (he owns stock in
General Electric Co., the parent of the NBC network), Mr.
Barr holds the decision-making power.
   "There has been no untoward pressure. . . . Everything is
quite appropriate," says Mr. Barr, stressing that network
lawyers have lobbied him, too. Mr. Rill, too, says it is
appropriate for affected parties to ask for a second opinion
from a higher official.
   For his part, Mr. Goldman defends his and Sen. Wilson's
efforts to help the motion-picture industry as perfectly
proper. "If Sen. Wilson can't represent an entire industry
that employs tens of thousands of people in his state, we
might as well just shut the Congress down," he says. "We're
talking about an entire industry here, we're not talking
about doing a favor for one particular constituent where
other senators have run into problems."
   Mr. Goldman stresses that Sen. Wilson has been a vigorous
advocate for the motion-picture industry in the Financial
Interest and Syndication Rules battle since 1983 and has also
been Hollywood's advocate on other issues, helping to win key
provisions for the movie industry in the 1986 tax and 1988
trade bills.
   Since Sen. Wilson has also enjoyed Hollywood's financial
backing in previous campaigns, Mr. Goldman says there's
nothing unusual about Thursday's fund-raiser. "There's only
the coincidence of timing," adds William Hamilton, Sen.
Wilson's campaign press secretary. Invitations to the
fund-raiser were sent out Labor Day weekend, nearly four
weeks after the Aug. 7 meeting, according to one of the
event's organizers.
   Although there has been a traditional Democratic tilt to
Hollywood's largess (in July, the Hollywood community raised
$650,000 for House Democrats in Beverly Hills), the GOP's
Sen. Wilson has been an exception. While he received only
token support from Hollywood executives during his first
senate campaign in 1982, by his 1988 re-election drive Sen.
Wilson had become a studio favorite, in large part due to his
work on the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules fight.
   In 1988, he received $56,500 from the political-action
committees of movie studios lobbying to save the rules and
another $51,250 from individual studio executives involved in
the battle, according to federal Election Commission data.
   Sen. Wilson in 1988 received more financial support from
Hollywood studio interests than Democratic Senate candidate
Leo McCarthy. And this year, he is expected to vastly outdraw
Diane Feinstein, the Democratic candidate for governor.
Although the former San Francisco mayor is supported by some
Hollywood executives such as Fox Chairman Barry Diller and
has had Hollywood fund-raising events of her own, a Feinstein
campaign aide says she won't come near the level of support
Sen. Wilson enjoys.
   Several Hollywood fund-raisers said they expected studio
interests to pump more than a million dollars into Sen.
Wilson's gubernatorial campaign before the November election.
"Some will hedge their bets and go with Feinstein, too, but
the bulk will go to Wilson," said one well-known Democratic
fund-raiser.
   Timothy Boggs, a Time Warner Inc. vice president and
spokesman for Mr. Daly, says, "Pete Wilson has long been a
personal friend of Mr. Daly's and he's enjoyed the political
support of the studios for a long time." Mr. Boggs adds: "It
wasn't extraordinary in any regard that Sen. Wilson and his
staff assisted in the meeting with the Justice Department.
Since Mr. Barr was new to the subject, we were anxious for
him to understand the priority we place on the maintenance of
the rules."
   Mr. Valenti, the 69-year-old former adviser to President
Johnson whose lobbying skills and fund-raising prowess are
legendary in Washington, was traveling in Europe and couldn't
be reached. The MPAA's Barbara Dixon says Mr. Valenti isn't
even going to the Wilson fund-raiser, although he lent his
name to the invitation. "Pete Wilson has always been a
sympathetic listener to the industry," she adds.

   HONG KONG -- In addition to new regulations for its Pudong
industrial project, Shanghai announced rules allowing foreign
banks to operate bank branches and other financial
institutions in the city proper.
   Foreign bankers said that, while the scope of business may
be too restrictive to make operating a branch profitable, the
tough rules won't deter them from trying to gain a toehold in
Shanghai, an industrial and commercial center and former
regional financial center. Until now, Beijing has allowed
foreign banks to open branches only in the country's five
special economic zones.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Four foreign banks -- Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.,
Standard Chartered Bank, Bank of East Asia and
Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp. -- already have Shanghai
branches, which they established before the Communist
takeover in 1949. This number will grow as the municipal
government is expected to approve the first batch of new
applicants soon.

   Big Wins for Boy-Next-Door and Pinup Girl
   ----

   New York -- It's fitting that New York, the nation's
theater capital, was the scene of a major change in the cast
of big-time tennis winners last weekend. Call the spiffed-up
production "New Faces of 1990," and expect its principals to
enjoy a long run as marquee names.
   The leading man in the U.S. Open, tennis's biggest and
best annual test, was Pete Sampras, a boy-next-door type from
suburban Los Angeles. In an eventful few days the
hard-hitting just-19-year-old rose from bit-part player to
star by beating Ivan Lendl, a three-time Open champion, and
John McEnroe, who'd won four times. In Sunday's final in
gray, cool weather, Sampras knocked glitzy Andre Agassi on
his brass, 6-4, 6-3 and 6-2. That made him the youngest male
singles winner of an event that dates from 1881.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The heroine was Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, famous
heretofore as the sport's pinup; tall, dark-haired and
liquid-eyed, she had a perfume contract while the other girls
were endorsing sneakers. But on a skywriting-clear Saturday
afternoon, she upset top-ranked Steffi Graf of Germany, her
longtime nemesis, 6-2 and 7-6 (7-4), for her first Grand Slam
title.
   Based on the rankings, Sampras's victory was the more
surprising. The gangly serve-and-volleyer had climbed from
81st to 12th this year, largely off a couple of wins at
routine pro-tour stops. Though considered promising by many,
he hadn't made the splash of some of his contemporaries, and
had seemed content merely to win sets here and there from the
game's big guns.
   Last week, however, he had observers searching for
historical comparisons as his power game blew away whomever
he found across the net. Suffice it to say that he showed
America's biggest serve since Ray Kroc's. He pounded home 24
aces against Lendl in a five-set quarterfinal and 17 against
Mad Mac, resurgent as the Svengali of the Volley, in a
four-set semi, and the sharpness of his net work and passing
shots had Tennis Center crowds gasping in admiration.
   His Sunday matchup with the fourth-ranked Agassi, a French
Open finalist this year, was interesting on several counts.
The two are close in age (Agassi is 20), and their meeting
was the first all-U.S. men's singles final at the Open since
1979. It also presented a nice contrast in personal styles,
Sampras being a quiet, neatly barbered kid who wears
traditional tennis whites, while Agassi, clad in neon-lime
and black, added bleached hair, an earring and a sometimes
beard to every teenage girl's father's nightmare.
   "Me and my clothes are everything America is," declared
Andre at midweek, and one shudders to think he might be
correct.
   Agassi, from Las Vegas, is a baseline brawler, a la Jimmy
Connors, and on Saturday he counterpunched his way past
defending champ Boris Becker in a four-set semi. But on
Sunday he never laid a glove on Sampras. Hitting lines at
120-or-so mph, the winner struck 13 service aces and Agassi
just ticked a half-dozen more. Sampras's serve never was
broken, and he lost just 17 points in 13 service games.
   Agassi didn't force a break point on Sampras's serve until
the third set, and had only three in that one. Sampras won
the last four games, scoring 12 straight points in one
stretch. Asked later if he might have "done more" with
Sampras's serve, Agassi said he didn't get his racket on it
often enough to think about that.
   Sampras attributed his metamorphosis to "just a great
couple of weeks." Though he confessed to being nervous
against crowd-favorite McEnroe on Saturday, he said he felt
"no nerves or anything" Sunday.
   Had he ever played better? he was asked of his finals win.
"Not this week. Not this year. Probably never," he smilingly,
and accurately, replied.
   Sabatini came into the tournament ranked and seeded fifth,
but given the recent-years' domination of women's tennis by
Graf and Martina Navratilova her triumph was almost as big a
reversal of form as was Sampras's. Although only 20 years
old, Sabatini had climbed toward her sport's pinnacle before
but been repulsed, mainly by Graf, who'd beaten her 18 times
in 21 previous meetings.
   And this year, with 16-year-old Monica Seles coming on to
win the French Open, and 33-year-old Navratilova coming back
to win Wimbledon, Gaby had all but been discounted as a Grand
Slam threat. The book on her was that, while talented, she
was short on stamina and confidence, and her baseline-rooted
game lacked variety.
   But Seles fell in round three to 82nd-ranked Linda
Ferrando in the sort of upset that's rare in women's tennis,
and Martina went into one of her occasional trances and bowed
to No. 9 Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, a nothing-special
Bulgarian, in a quarterfinal.
   That opened the bottom half of the draw for Sabatini, and
she seized the opportunity mainly by dispelling the rap that
she's easily pooped. Her two-set quarterfinal win over Leila
Meskhi of the U.S.S.R. lasted 2 1/2 hours, and her three-set
semifinal with Mary Joe Fernandez, a 19-year-old Miamian,
consumed 13 minutes more. Meanwhile, Graf hummed through her
matches as though she were double-parked, averaging about an
hour on court in dispatching her first six foes.
   But according to her coach, Carlos Kirmayr, Sabatini
showed more than fortitude in beating Fernandez. "We'd talked
together a lot about her coming to the net more, but she'd
only done it when she was way ahead or behind," he said.
"Against Mary Joe, she came in on the big points, and she did
it again against Steffi."
   Two points stand out in that regard: A lunging backhand
volley winner that set up match point for Sabatini against
Fernandez, and a less gymnastic but equally effective sally
that did the same in the tiebreaker vs. Graf. Match point in
the final came on a forehand winner off a net-cord shot,
after which the newly confirmed net rusher rushed the stands
to embrace her loved ones.
   "I made up my mind I wasn't going to lose any points. I
wanted her to have to win them," Sabatini said after her
concluding victory. She'd said that before, but this time she
meant it.

   BOISE, Idaho -- At the headquarters of Albertson's Inc.,
one of the nation's three most profitable supermarket chains,
vice chairman and chief financial officer Gary Michael is
confident. With 524 stores located in middle-class markets
throughout the West and across the Sunbelt to Texas and
Florida, his company is well placed to keep growing in the
1990s.
   One key to Albertson's success, however, has been its
quickness to close stores that are fading, Mr. Michael notes.
The chain doesn't aim for overall market share but for
per-store revenue marks. And although he thinks price is
secondary to other factors in keeping his registers humming,
Mr. Michael concedes that if any of his shops get caught in
an untenable cost trap he will pull the plug pronto.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The prospect, if unlikely, isn't an idle one. Along the
West Coast, Albertson's has joined other chain grocers in
recent months in a series of wage pacts with the United Food
and Commercial Workers (UFCW) to lift the pay of experienced
clerks and butchers to the $12-$15/hour range, with rather
generous medical plans and vesting of benefits to part-timers
working as little as 16 hours a week. That's fine for
everybody in the industry until a nonunion challenger
arrives. Now that day may be here.
   Wal-Mart is coming to California, and its food outlets
could follow. "Warehouse" sellers such as Costco, Price
Savers and PACE got started in the West offering housewares
nearly a decade ago, and now do a third of their business in
groceries. The discounters are hitting the high-cost
Northeast markets, too.
   Some doubt this will amount to much. Analyst Sarah Stack
of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles says these
operators account for just 2% of the supermarket trade, and
doesn't think that will grow much. She agrees with
Albertson's Mr. Michael that convenient location, local
identity and manageable store size appeal more to shoppers
than slashed prices.
   To some degree, the grocers have gotten the cost message.
Kimberly Walin, a Shearson Lehman analyst, says wage
settlements generally have trailed the cost of living since
the mid-'80s. At the UFCW's Washington, D.C., offices,
William Olwell, executive vice president for collective
bargaining, acknowledges that his union's compensation rates
have met resistance.
   The warehouse stores, because they require items to be
bought in larger quantities, can't capture most consumers,
Mr. Olwell believes. But they're pinching. Sam's (as in
Walton) Wholesale Club "has done damage to our employers."
Together with nonunion grocery chains such as fast-growing
Food Lion in the South, they're holding UFCW membership from
the industry to about 800,000 nationwide. Cost pressure was a
cause of the much-noted Safeway layoffs and pullout from
Dallas.
   Mr. Olwell says unionization rates are above 90% along the
West Coast. This is abetted by the antitrust-proof practice
of group negotiating by employers (and union locals) in
various regions. Even mainly nonunion entrants to the field,
such as Smith's from Utah, which plans 60 huge stores in
Southern California over the next five years, fall in step
and require workers to sign up with the UFCW. This "parity"
is fine with Albertson's Mr. Michael, who seems to assent to
what Mr. Olwell says is the UFCW's main goal: "to eliminate
wages as a competitive factor."
   Consumers may not endorse that happy arrangement. Mr.
Olwell himself says that whereas he "didn't have to worry as
much" in the 1960s and '70s, when a nonunion operator would
typically keep whatever was scrimped from pay or fringes,
these days the saving underwrites price wars for which
higher-paying chains are less suited. (However, he claims
that in Florida, where the UFCW's situation is a "basket
case," shoppers are not realizing the gains from wage
discounts he says are 40% off the "normal" rates.)
   Other things equal, a higher wage scale will bolster
longevity in the job -- ideally of employees who please
customers. Management and labor both cite this stability as a
plus, comparing grocery help favorably with department-store
cashiers whose pay is less and turnover higher. This is why
some nonunion grocers, and even a warehouse chain like
Costco, will at least match union scale. (The biggest of the
warehousers, Price Club of San Diego, has a Teamsters
contract.)
   Mr. Michael, whose stores are nonunion away from the West
Coast, says Albertson's succeeds with either type of labor.
But he credits having the chain in many low-cost market
areas, as well as minimizing central-office overhead, with
its 11%-plus return on average assets.
   Still, with costs for its 55,000 employees constituting
70% of Albertson's operating expenses (exclusive of
inventory), the union contracts are a potential drag on
profitability. Of the recent West Coast settlements, Mr.
Michael says, "We have to get productivity increases out of
those wage increases. . . . We have to have programs in the
meat departments where you cut more, where you bring in the
beef a little differently and you trim it differently.
Consumers are not going to let you pass it along."
   He thinks Albertson's can tough it out with Sam Walton's
crew if need be. "When it comes to quality and assortment,
they can't compete with us," he says. "They're not going to
be able to sell fresh produce necessarily cheaper than we
are. It's not like selling toilet paper. You can't buy ahead.
If lettuce freezes in Salinas, their lettuce freezes just
like ours does."
   If outsiders are to penetrate rich marketplaces such as
California, they will probably do best on urban outskirts.
Land costs in established areas are so high that finding a
site there and then trying to draw customers away from
established chains is considered a longshot.
   Once blessed with a desirable address, the modern
supermarket tries to provide "one-stop shopping" for daily
needs, food or otherwise. By typically offering four times
the selection of items to be found in a low-cost "warehouse,"
the UFCW's Mr. Olwell says, the full-service chain store can
retain customers who don't want to shuttle shop.
   We'll see. The warehouse stores, even with a cumbersome
membership arrangement, have boosted sales to $20 billion
from $1 billion in 1984. In 1988 the trade journal
Supermarket News found they offered more than a 14% savings
on food items. No wonder the UFCW is trying to organize them.
(Even if they pay according to scale, however, their lean
staffing is going to bleed the union.)
   Grocery wage and benefit levels in much of the country are
a service-sector anomaly. Without commensurately higher
output they cannot be sustained, even in a cartelized
bargaining setup, unless consumers are prepared to pay extra
for whatever service or convenience premium is involved. To
date, most have been willing to do that, but their choices
are widening. If economic hard times are visited on the broad
middle class, they may choose another checkstand.

   Mercedes to Introduce 3 Diesel Models
   To Help It Meet U.S. Fuel Standards

   DETROIT -- Mercedes-Benz of North America said it will
introduce three diesel models later this month, after nearly
eliminating diesels from its U.S. product line during the
last three years.
   Mercedes, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany, said
it is counting on the midsize 300D, and the larger 350SD and
350SDL turbos, to help it meet government fuel economy
standards. The 1991 diesels range in price from $41,000 for
the 300D model to $57,800 for the 350SDL.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mercedes hasn't had a diesel among its medium or
large-sized cars in the U.S. since 1987, and didn't sell many
diesel-equipped versions of its compact 190 model. Company
officials concede that some customers complained that the
diesels performed poorly, and that diesels simply weren't
particularly attractive in an era of low gasoline prices.
   Now that era may be ending. While Mercedes was planning to
reintroduce diesels before the Persian Gulf crisis sent
gasoline prices soaring, it is clear the company was
concerned that federal fuel-economy standards would increase
in the long term.
   The U.S. Senate is preparing to debate legislation that
could raise the average standard to 40 miles a gallon or more
by the year 2001. Currently, only a few subcompact cars meet
that requirement. Diesel engines generally get better fuel
economy than gasoline engines, though they also tend to have
more tailpipe emissions. In fact, the new diesel models won't
be sold in California, because they don't comply with that
state's strict emissions standards.
   Mercedes, however, says its new diesels will perform
better, run quieter and have cleaner exhausts than their
predecessors. Mercedes said the 1991 models also get more
miles a gallon: The 300D, for example, gets 27 miles a gallon
compared with the smaller 1974-model 240D, which got 24 miles
a gallon.
   At 27 miles to the gallon, the new 300D will come close to
meeting the current federal corporate average fuel economy
standard of 27.5 miles a gallon.
   So far, Mercedes hasn't fared well in its attempts to meet
existing fuel laws, because it builds big cars. Last year,
Mercedes had to pay $20.4 million in federal fuel-economy
penalties. The auto maker's estimated penalty for 1990 is
$18.6 million, based on an average fuel economy of 21.2 miles
a gallon for all cars it sold in the U.S. In 1989, the auto
maker's average fuel economy was 21.4 miles a gallon on cars
sold in the U.S.
   "If you build large automobiles, it isn't easy to comply
with fuel-economy regulations," Albert Weiss, general
marketing manager for Mercedes-Benz of North America, said at
a preview of the auto maker's 1991 model lineup. "If building
big cars brings penalties, I guess we'll have to live with
that."
   The company also will have to live with federal
"gas-guzzler" taxes of between $500 to $1,300 a car on about
half of its 1991 model line.
   Mercedes officials said they don't expect a big sales
surge from the new diesels despite the Mideast crisis,
because the rise in gasoline prices hasn't been strong or
sustained enough to influence its customers. The company
wouldn't project U.S. sales for next year. For the first
eight months of this year, Mercedes sold just over 48,000
cars in the U.S., about equal with last year. For all of last
year, though, the company's U.S. sales were 24% below the
peak year of 1986.

   Greyhound Dial
   Purchases Breck
   Hair-Care Lines

   Greyhound Dial Corp. said it acquired the Breck hair-care
products unit of American Cyanamid Corp. Terms of the
purchase weren't disclosed.
   Analysts estimated the price at about $50 million, $10
million less than Breck's revenue last year. A Dial executive
insisted the price was "well under that."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With 60 years of history behind it, Breck is a well-known
brand that has lost its sheen. Brooke Shields, Cybill
Shepherd and Kim Basinger were "Breck Girls" at the beginning
of their careers, and heavy print and TV advertising over the
years made it the market leader in shampoo. But Breck's share
of the hair-care market shrank drastically in recent years,
when American Cyanamid lost interest in its consumer products
group and stopped spending money on advertising and
promotion, analysts say.
   "Customers in the hair-care market are notoriously
fickle," said analyst Bonita Austin of Wertheim Schroder &amp;
Co. "There's little brand loyalty and they're
price-sensitive, so you've got to do a lot of promotion and
new-product introduction."
   Although Breck's shampoo market share has shrunk to about
1.3% and its hair-spray business is its biggest line, Dial
plans to try to resuscitate the shampoo and conditioner lines
first. "We feel it was tired and it was resting," said the
president of the Dial unit, Andrew S. Patti, in an interview.
"What we want to do is wake it up." He said they will spend
ad dollars, use research and development to improve quality,
create more new products and modernize the image. "We're
going to be in there fighting all the time," Mr. Patti said.
   Breck's hair spray had a 4% market share last year, but it
has fallen victim to spritzers and more modern names invading
the field. "Hair spray has a dowdy, old-fashioned image,"
says analyst Andrew Shore of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
"Dial will need to contemporize the image, change the
packaging and appeal to a younger audience, which
necessitates a much bigger advertising budget."
   American Cyanamid, a Wayne, N.J., chemical company, has
been shedding its troubled Shulton Group consumer products
businesses since the beginning of the year. With the sale of
Breck, which American Cyanamid bought in 1963, the segment is
now defunct. The company divested itself of Old Spice, Lady's
Choice, Pine-Sol and Pierre Cardin fragrances to various
buyers, including Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which will get
Breck's price deducted from the $370 million it agreed to pay
American Cyanamid for a number of consumer product lines
acquired last June.
   Greyhound Dial, which sold its bus company in 1987 and
changed its name from Greyhound Corp. earlier this year, said
the acquisition would give Dial sales of more than $1 billion
a year. Greyhound Dial, Phoenix, Ariz., makes and markets a
number of consumer products including Dial soap, Brillo soap
pads, Purex Bleach and Armour Star canned meats. It also has
interests in transportation and financial services.

   China Keeps the Investment Door Ajar

   China gave details of its multibillion-dollar program to
revive the economy of Shanghai, apparently hoping to attract
foreign investment for a project to regain for China's
largest city its lost status as one of Asia's most important
manufacturing centers.
   But even Chinese officials, as well as foreign investors,
say the plan to build a giant industrial zone called Pudong,
or East Shanghai, across the Huangpu River from teeming
Shanghai, initially could do more harm than good to
Shanghai's ailing industries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still, the opening of Pudong sends an important signal
that China's doors remain open to foreign investors despite
the reassertion of central planning that followed the
pro-democracy movement's suppression last year.
   Yesterday, Shanghai officials announced the preferential
investment regulations for foreign and domestic enterprises
in Pudong. Under the Pudong plan, first promulgated in April,
a modern industrial, commercial and financial center is to be
built on a 135-square-mile tract of rural land at the estuary
of the Yangtze River. Chinese planners estimate that
completion of the site's utilities, roads, housing, factories
and other infrastructure will take about 30 years and cost
between $70 billion and $80 billion.
   Foreign businessmen have shown little enthusiasm for the
project. Though they concede that the overall plan is sound,
they say the rules announced yesterday appear only slightly
more attractive than those already available elsewhere in
China. They also note that the investments in Pudong for
years will be limited largely to big infrastructural
projects, including power plants, ports and highways.
   In addition, Chinese officials say that development of
Pudong could hurt factories in Shanghai proper, which already
accounts for 10% of China's total industrial output. These
factories don't get the preferential taxes and other
incentives that will cover Pudong, so they stand to lose
orders to Pudong, and probably will suffer in competition for
bank loans and funds.
   "How do we not hurt Shanghai industry too much while we
develop Pudong? That is going to be very difficult," says a
Chinese adviser to the Pudong plan.
   In February, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping visited
Shanghai, giving his blessing to the Pudong plan when the
subject was broached by former Shanghai Mayor Wang Daohan.
Mr. Wang drafted the development plan in 1985.
   "Pudong waves the political banner for Beijing leaders,"
says Ming K. Chan, an analyst with the Hoover Institution, a
U.S. think tank. "If Pudong succeeds, it will lend substance
to Deng Xiaoping's claim that China's open-door policy hasn't
changed."
   The choice of Pudong also marks a shift in the country's
development strategy. Under former Communist Party
General-Secretary Zhao Ziyang, Guangdong province and other
southern coastal regions were the major beneficiaries of the
central government's preferential investment programs.
   Indeed, all of the country's five special economic zones,
the laboratories for experiments in market-style reform, are
in the south. "The current regime wants its own turf, and
Shanghai is its big apple," says Mr. Chan, because it has
faithfully toed the central-government line.
   With Pudong, the focus of development is being shifted.
Chinese planners hope that development of Pudong will
invigorate the slumbering industries in Shanghai, as well as
in the vast hinterland of the Yangtze River delta. Shanghai
lost much of its prominence as a manufacturing giant
following the Communist takeover of China in 1949, when many
industrialists fled to the British colony of Hong Kong.
   Foreign capital is vital to Pudong. Beijing has pledged
only 6.5 billion yuan, or about $1.38 billion in funds and
concessionary loans for the first 10 years, with an
additional one billion to two billion yuan a year to be
supplied by the Shanghai municipality. But Sha Lin, one of
Pudong's planners, estimates that for the first three years
alone, 26 billion to 30 billion yuan will be needed to build
infrastructural facilities.
   So it was to attract the needed foreign capital that
Shanghai yesterday announced the investment regulations and
preferential policies for Pudong. As in other special
economic zones, foreign-invested enterprises will be subject
to a 15% profits tax, considerably lower than outside the
special zones. Enterprises that agree to operate in Pudong
for more than 10 years will get full exemption from profits
tax for the first two profit-making years, and a 50%
reduction in the following three years. Further benefits will
be extended to export-oriented enterprises.
   For enterprises that invest in airport, port and other
transport facilities and that agree to operate for more than
15 years, the tax-exemption and tax-reduction period would
each be extended to five years.
   Foreign companies will be allowed to set up trading
companies in Waigaoqiao, part of Pudong zoned as a duty-free
bonded area, to handle trade for foreign enterprises in
Waigaoqiao. Imports of goods into the zone would be
tariff-free so long as they are used for production of goods
for export. Bonded warehouses established elsewhere in China
already perform similar functions.
   Foreign banks will be allowed to set up branches in Pudong
to engage mainly in lending and trade financing, the first
time such activities have been permitted outside the existing
special economic zones. The banks won't be allowed to handle
local-currency business, though.
   Lack of fresh incentives in the rules is a big drawback.
Foreign businessmen had expected the regulations to create a
free-trade zone in Pudong that would allow foreign trading
companies to gain easier access to China's domestic market.
Under current nationwide regulations, all imports and exports
are handled by Chinese trading companies. But Monday's
package disclosed that Pudong will be little more than a
large duty-free bonded area.
   The lack of substantial new incentives could put Pudong at
a disadvantage when vying for foreign funds with the special
economic zones in the south. Even so, Pudong will benefit
from the advantages of easy access to Shanghai's developed
supporting industries and abundant supply of skilled labor,
foreign businessmen say.

   Dear President Bush:
   I am a 26 year old Army Reservist and I am ready, if
called, to serve in the Persian Gulf. I can only speak for
myself, but I believe that many other Reservists, and indeed
members of my generation, share my commitment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I volunteered to join the Army and eventually the Reserve
not for tuition money and benefits, but so that I would be
ready to help our country in just this kind of crisis. Make
no mistake, I fear war and I fear death. I am married and I
have a lot to lose. But I am willing to endure hardship and
risk my life to help our country defeat an aggressive leader
who could kill millions in the future if left unchecked. We
need only to remember Saddam Hussein's threat "to scorch half
of Israel" with chemical weapons to understand the danger.
   I am not poor. I am not underprivileged. I earned my
undergraduate degree at Harvard, and am about to start my
second year at Harvard Business School. However, I am willing
to leave my wife and delay both my education and career to
serve our country in this crisis -- even if that means going
to war.
   Mr. President, I know that many Americans, especially
members of the generation now in its 30s and 40s, can think
of nothing but the tragedy of Vietnam when they see military
uniforms or hear talk of war. But I have studied the history
of other wars. As a result, I do not forget the 6 million
Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust or the 250,000
American soldiers and sailors (young men like myself) who
died fighting the dictatorial perpetrators of these and other
crimes during World War II. There is no doubt that there are
times when fighting a war is unnecessary -- even immoral.
Perhaps Vietnam was one of those occasions. Perhaps not. But
it is equally true that there are times when a democratic
people must go to war to halt aggression and atrocity.
   Of course it would be best if you and other world leaders
could peacefully maneuver Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait and
out of power. However, if you fail, please have confidence
that I am prepared, as many others in my generation are, to
make whatever sacrifice is necessary to do the job by force
of arms.
   Mr. President, 50 years ago you faced combat for your
country in a just and necessary war. If you need me now, I
will too.

   For some people, the end of summer means more than packing
away swimsuits and surfing gear. It means closing down a
business.
   Next month, for instance, Robert Drake will lock the door
of his clothing store in Highlands, N.C., which he opens
every May. The rest of the year he spends running his store
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</LP>

   Mr. Drake has owned his Fort Lauderdale business, Rob't
Drake Inc., for 35 years. He says he opened the branch in
Highlands partly to follow many of his Fort Lauderdale
customers who regularly head for the summer resort town in
the North Carolina mountains.
   Thousands of entrepreneurs such as Mr. Drake move with the
seasons. The way of life is filled with special strains and
problems. But many who follow it say it fulfills a simple
dream that somehow eludes almost everybody: to live in a
pleasant climate all the time.

winter, he moves among arts and crafts fairs in the Florida
Keys. The leathersmith says his work requires him to "follow
people's wallets around the country." But that suits him just
fine. What he loves is "the freedom of it all," he says. He
just can't see the advantage of living all year in a place
that one hates part of the year.
   Each year, thousands feel the lure of Mr. Correia's way of
life. Maureen and Stephen Horn own and manage two restaurants
in Cape May. Now they're looking for a third restaurant -- in
Florida.
   The two restaurants in Cape May, Maureen and Es-ta-ti,
open in April and close in October. Mrs. Horn says she wants
to spend the period from Thanksgiving to Easter in Florida.
"We want to take the best months in each location," she says.
"That's our philosophy in business." Many resort restaurants
don't survive because they stay open all year round, she
adds.
   But others find the way of life has its fair share of
problems. Mary-Lu Young remembers them from the 21 years that
she and her husband, Earl, ran gift stores in Highlands,
N.C., and Palm Beach, Fla.
   Above all, Mrs. Young says she hadn't expected that she
would have to cater to different tastes in the two towns --
even among the same customers. In Palm Beach, she says, her
customers became much more glitzy. They wanted Italian
imports instead of the more traditional Southern goods in the
Highlands store.
   Mr. and Mrs. Young had also expected to be able to take a
month's vacation between the seasonal moves. But the seasons
gradually extended in both resorts and soon began to overlap.
And "it's always difficult to get part-time help," especially
in an expensive resort town, she says.
   For all the difficulties, Mrs. Young wouldn't have had it
any other way. "There's real variety with the sea and the
mountains," she says. Though she says high rent prompted the
couple to close the Palm Beach store, the Youngs still
operate the Highlands store and split their time between the
two resort towns. "Now we have the same life style without
the work."
   Some think this way of life is more trouble than it is
worth. Joseph Dougherty runs Dock's, an oyster bar in
Atlantic City, N.J., that his grandfather opened 93 years
ago. In 1987, he opened another oyster bar in Jupiter, Fla.,
called "Dock's Since 1897." Now Mr. Dougherty closes the
Atlantic City business for all but three months of the year;
the Jupiter business remains open year round. For the three
months that he spends in Atlantic City, the Jupiter operation
is run by his son.
   But Mr. Dougherty doesn't think he would do it again.
"Everybody thinks you must have the best of both worlds," he
says, "but in fact, you never have any time off." He says he
managed to soften the blow of opening the Florida business by
using architects and interior designers from Atlantic City.
But he still had to find employees and supervise the business
while he was in New Jersey.
   Mr. Dougherty says having the second business brought his
family closer together. Still, he doesn't think that
justifies the work involved: "Now we're just running from one
place to another."
   Yet many -- such as teachers -- find seasonal businesses
mesh well with their other activities. "It works out so
ideally," says Daniel Millea, a former teacher from Johnston,
R.I. "May to September you have to yourself . . . and this
coincides with the holiday season." He started the "Book
Nook," a book store in Block Island, R.I., 18 years ago.
Although meant to be a hobby "to keep body and soul together
during the summer vacations," it slowly turned into something
more profitable.

<TEXT>
   A number of our old friends and colleagues in the
conservative movement are offering an eccentric intepretation
of the present crisis. Mr. Bush's military intervention is,
they argue, a proper cause not for conservatives but for
neo-conservatives. A war, in which no vital American interest
is at stake, is being prepared for the benefit of Israel, the
despotic ruling family of Kuwait, and some utopian vision of
international order in which the U.S. would fight the UN's
wars. (Take your pick.) The deserts of Arabia will, against
all meteorological precedent, become a quagmire for American
forces. Bug out, America.
   National Review, which can lay some claim to unhyphenated
conservatism, begs to differ.
   America has at least three clear and vital interests in
this crisis. The first is secure access to oil at a price not
determined by a cartel under Iraqi military discipline. Our
second interest is in ousting an aggressive dictator who
seeks to lead "the Arab world" and who is building up
chemical and nuclear weapons in a region which has major U.S.
allies. These allies include, yes, Israel, but also Egypt,
Saudi Arabia, the Gulf sheikhdoms, and above all Turkey, to
which the U.S. is bound by NATO obligations and which has a
long-standing border dispute with Iraq. Not Zionism but
prudence suggests reducing the Iraqi threat while it is still
non-nuclear.
   Our third interest is to ensure that the post-cold-war
world should, as far as possible, be one of peace and
stability. This is not global altruism. As a world power with
economic interests on all continents, the U.S. has a strong
interest in the international order that trade and overseas
investment require. Nor has it anything to do with a
universal crusade. Some local disputes will be ignored under
a "Pax Americana" just as Latin American wars went on
undisturbed during the "Pax Britannica". But disputes that
menace the wider world must be suppressed, or, better still,
prevented. The present crisis is exactly that. A victory for
Saddam Hussein would be an incentive to every Third World
dictator to settle his border disputes by force and to
acquire nuclear weapons as the means of certain victory; an
unadorned defeat would deter potential imitators. Our actions
now might well make the difference, at moderate cost, between
a century of commercial prosperity and one of multiplying
local conflicts and proliferating nuclear threats.
   Against these solid interests, what arguments do our
friends on the neo-isolationist Right offer? They cite the
strategic defeatism of veterans of Jimmy Carter's National
Security Council. They borrow the Vietnam analogy from
Democratic opponents of Reagan's support for the Contras.
They swallow straight from Iraqi Ba'ath party propaganda the
notion of Arab nationalism sweeping all before it -- which is
hard to reconcile with its record of economic and military
failure, religious, tribal, and national division, and
internecine rivalry since 1945. They copy such sophisticated
inversions of the "foreign-policy establishment" as that an
American victory would be pyrrhic, leading to the overthrow
of friendly Arab regimes -- an argument which assumes that
the Gulf sheikhdoms now hosting U.S. forces are unaware of
their own interests and that they would be less threatened by
a U.S. defeat or U.S. inactivity in the face of Saddam's
aggression. They steal the argument that American power
should be committed only in support of democracy, to which
Kuwait's emir bears little resemblance -- from the
neo-conservatives] And when all else fails, they mutter
gloomily behind their hands that President Bush will "cave"
-- that is, follow their advice.
   Such determined despair is unwarranted by the strategic
facts on the ground. President Bush has shown skill and
fortitude in building up a powerful force in Saudi Arabia
backed by diplomatic support from virtually the entire world.
We expect him to bite the bullet of military action when he
judges the time is right to reduce Iraq's power to harm. If
in the end he retreats, leaving Saddam Hussein to continue
his nuclear and chemical buildup for the next aggression, we
will criticize him as unambiguously then as we support him
now -- and we will have earned the right to do so. Those
conservatives who by their carping defeatism have made the
task of defeating Saddam Hussein appreciably more difficult
will have no such right. Should their views prevail, they
will have to live through the ensuing local wars, overthrows
of U.S. allies, credible threats of chemical and nuclear
aggression, spread of anti-American terrorism, seizure of
U.S. assets in the Third World, and disruption of the world
trade and commerce that underpins our domestic prosperity
without complaint and, we trust, in humble and contrite
silence.

   Workers Strike
   At Most Paper Mills
   Of Abitibi-Price

   TORONTO -- Workers at most Abitibi-Price Inc. paper mills
in eastern Canada went on strike, shutting down about 7% of
North American newsprint capacity.
   Analysts and industry executives said a short strike won't
have much impact on the newsprint market. Other producers can
make up some of the production lost at Abitibi's mills. As
well, U.S. publishers and other users had an average 39-day
supply of newsprint on hand at the end of July, the latest
figures available.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But a long strike could cause problems for publishers and
push up newsprint prices. "The newsprint market was pretty
tight already," said Raymond Kilroy, an analyst at Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc.
   Publishers are worried about possible strikes at other big
Canadian newsprint concerns. On Friday Canadian Pacific
Forest Products Ltd. presented a final offer to workers at
three newsprint mills and one pulp mill in eastern Canada.
The company expects an answer by tomorrow, a spokesman said.
The three Canadian Pacific Forest newsprint mills account for
about 7% of North American capacity.
   Talks with Abitibi broke down late yesterday, a spokesman
for the Canadian Paperworkers Union said. The company
presented its final offer to the union early yesterday
morning. The union presented a counteroffer yesterday
afternoon but the company wouldn't alter its final proposal,
the union spokesman said.
   Industry and union officials said workers at Abitibi and
other pulp and paper mills in eastern Canada aren't happy
with the contract accepted earlier this summer by workers at
Stone Container Corp.'s Canadian unit. The Stone Container
contract was supposed to set the pattern for workers at other
mills in the region.
   The strike has shut down seven Abitibi mills in Ontario,
Quebec and Newfoundland, six of which make newsprint, Abitibi
said. A union official said two other mills in Quebec are
expected to join the strike. Abitibi mills at Alma, Quebec,
and Pine Falls, Manitoba, which are represented by other
unions, will continue to operate, Abitibi said. As well, the
company's two U.S. mills aren't affected by the strike. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading Abitibi closed at
$13.375, down 12.5 cents.
   Separately, the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said
Canadian production of newsprint rose 1.4% in July from a
year earlier as the industry operated at 94% of capacity.
   The industry group said Canadian mills produced 826,000
metric tons of newsprint in July compared with 815,000 metric
tons a year earlier. For the year to date, output fell 1.4%
to 5.56 million metric tons from 5.64 million metric tons a
year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.6 pounds.
   The July 94% operating rate was down from 95% in May and
from 96% a year earlier.
   July shipments fell 3.0% to 751,000 metric tons from
775,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to Canada rose
while shipments to the U.S. and other foreign markets fell.
For the year to date, shipments rose 0.2% to 5.49 million
metric tons from 5.48 million metric tons in the year-earlier
period.

   Congress Passes a Bill Likely to Force
   Many Hotels to Install Room Sprinklers

   Congress passed a bill that in effect will force many
hotels to install sprinklers in rooms -- which only about
half of hotels currently do.
   The bill was passed yesterday despite heavy opposition
from some hotel chains, and industry experts predicted that
rates would eventually rise significantly. Although no
industrywide figures are available, the cost to install a
sprinkler system can be more than a $1,500 a room.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The impact on the hotel industry is going to be
terrible," said Randy Smith, president of Smith Travel
Research in Hendersonville, Tenn. "There's no question hotels
are going to have to try to pass this on to consumers."
   But supporters of the bill insisted the cost impact
wouldn't be quite so drastic, because hotels would save on
lower insurance rates. They also noted that more than 400
people have been killed in hotel fires in U.S. in the past
six years. "The U.S. has the worst rate of fire loss in the
industrialized world," said Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a New
York Republican who sponsored the legislation.
   Currently, most states require the installation of
sprinkler systems and smoke detectors in new hotels. But only
a handful of states -- including Hawaii, Nevada,
Massachusetts and Florida -- require operators to install the
systems in existing hotels. Nearly all hotels have smoke
detectors, but only 48% of them have sprinklers, according to
a survey by the American Hotel and Motel Association.
   The bill doesn't directly force the installation of
sprinklers, because the federal government doesn't have that
kind of jurisdiction. Instead, it prohibits nearly all
federal travel to hotels that don't have sprinklers. Industry
officials say that should force many hotels to install the
safety equipment, because federal employees represent such a
huge market, spending about $1.5 billion a year on hotels.
   The legislation was stalled for nearly three years,
primarily by heavy lobbying by some hotels and by opposition
from the Reagan administration. President Bush, however, is
expected to sign the bill, which is weaker than the original
version. It exempts, for example, hotels that are three
stories or less and won't be fully phased in until 1996.
   Even in its weaker form, some industry experts say the
bill is going to hit many chains hard, because they won't be
able to pass on all the costs. The industry has been in a
slump for several years now because the market became too
glutted with new properties. With competition so fierce,
rates have risen only mariginally the past four years. This
year, they are expected to rise only 3% -- below inflation.
   The bill was passed last month by the Senate and approved
by voice vote yesterday in the House.

individual equities, which the exchange said is an industry

   The so-called Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities, or
LEAPS, are designed to appeal to retail investors "with a
longer time horizon who do not currently use options," the
exchange said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The long-term put and call options for selected individual
stocks will differ from existing stock options by providing
investors with the ability to hedge against market swings for
as long as two years. In comparison, the options for the 14
companies -- including International Business Machines Corp.;
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and General Electric Co. -- on whose
common shares LEAPS will initially be offered, currently
extend a maximum of eight months.

   Quota Bill
   Vs. King's Dream

   If I were still practicing law, I would love the
Kennedy-Hawkins Bill -- the so-called "Civil Rights Act of
1990." It may enrich contingency fee lawyers. But it will
also impoverish the principle of equality of all Americans.
All my life, beginning in the darkest days of segregation in
my home state of Georgia, I have fought against the principle
of color preference, then known as "white supremacy." This
bill institutionalizes color preference under the false flag
of civil rights. It is not a civil rights bill. It is a quota
bill that will achieve precisely what the landmark 1964 Civil
Rights Act stood foursquare against.
   Proportionality of result, not equality of opportunity, is
the touchstone of this flawed legislation. It creates a
presumption of guilt based only on crude race or gender
statistical imbalances in the workplace, and then forces
employers to rebut that presumption under a standard of proof
that rules out the pursuit of excellence as a defense and is
very difficult to meet. The cumulative weight of this stacked
deck will make the risk of having the wrong numbers so great
that the employer, in self-defense, will hire by quota.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to the blandishments of its supporters,
Kennedy-Hawkins rewrites 20 years of civil rights law. It
would do something I never thought I would see in America --
it would make racial, ethnic and sex imbalance alone
presumptively illegal. Under Kennedy-Hawkins, a plaintiff
need only allege a statistical disparity between minorities
in the labor pool and on the job, and charge that the
employer's practices collectively caused the imbalance --
nothing more. Because it effectively eliminates the
requirement that plaintiffs identify a specific
discriminatory practice, the legislation would turn a civil
rights complaint into an indictment without a bill of
particulars.
   By effectively making bottom-line statistical imbalances
proof of discrimination (although protesting that it does
not), Kennedy-Hawkins holds employers hostage to raw census
data. Those statistics do not measure individual differences
in skills, experience, training or quality of education
within each job group. But such distinctions do matter: Try
convincing an employer that there's no difference between the
graduates of a third-rate college and those of a first-rate
university.
   The bill's faith in the idea that statistical disparities
alone create a presumption of discrimination is equally
flawed. Abraham Lincoln's friend, the former slave Frederick
Douglass, understood the divisive and destructive
implications of the belief that, in a world without
discrimination, there would be racial proportionality in
every human endeavor: "Equality of numbers," he wrote in
1871, "has nothing to do with equality of attainments."
   Without the requirement that the plaintiff specifically
charge discrimination, employers must justify every hiring or
promotion practice that might account for the imbalance --
and prove their innocence by rebutting a presumption of guilt
so difficult to overcome and so costly to fight that they
will capitulate and hire by numbers.
   The proposed standard requires the employer to demonstrate
that every one of his hiring or promotion criteria "bear{s} a
significant relationship to successful performance of the
job" by means of "demonstrable evidence." How many employers
can "prove" that their hiring criteria -- whether they be
standardized tests, job interviews, written or oral skills,
education or experience -- definitively correlate with
successful job performance? Could a Supreme Court justice
prove by "demonstrable evidence" -- whatever that means -- a
"significant relationship" -- whatever that means -- between
law review experience and successful performance as a Supreme
Court clerk -- especially when seeking out the best is no
defense? Could a college faculty show that tenure track
candidates who publish articles always make better teachers
or advance the cause of knowledge?
   Under this test, merit and high standards go out the
window, impairing not only the principle of American equality
but, inevitably, American efficiency and productivity.
Together, the bill's presumption of guilt and its high hurdle
of proof will force employers to avoid lawsuits and potential
liability by hiring and promoting by quota.
   Kennedy-Hawkins wages war on objective standards at a time
when this society can least afford a lesser measure of
achievement. Objective criteria may not be perfect; some may
mask discriminatory intent, or have little relation to the
job. But Kennedy-Hawkins wields a bludgeon where a scalpel
would do. Existing law already walks the fine line between
protecting standards and weeding out potentially
discriminatory criteria. The Supreme Court's 1989 Ward's Cove
v. Atonio decision, the case Kennedy-Hawkins would overturn,
already demands an exacting standard of business necessity:
Why fix it if it's not broken?
   But the social costs of a quota bill go beyond loss of
productivity and efficiency. It balkanizes and tribalizes our
nation by raising the color line; it stigmatizes and
demoralizes those it supposedly helps. Kennedy-Hawkins may be
a middle-class minority ride to preferential treatment; but
it won't solve our real minority problems. It won't help
fight the crack epidemic ravaging our minority youth; it
won't stem the tide of unwed minority teen pregnancies; it
won't stop the breakdown of our inner-city education system.
   Congress and this administration have the opportunity,
perhaps more than any other in recent years, to forge a new
and lasting civil rights consensus. Every opinion poll
confirms that the vast majority of Americans of all races
share the goals of equal opportunity and color blindness and
will support the vision of Martin Luther King, who urged that
we judge ourselves "not by the color of our skin but by the
content of our character." Let's not miss this chance by
endorsing a quota bill.

   NEW YORK -- Stock and oil prices seesawed in opposite
directions as investors first coolly assessed the Mideast
developments, and then fearfully jumped at shadows.
   The October futures contract for crude oil started the day
dropping sharply lower -- as much as $1.69 a barrel -- and
stock prices headed higher; the Dow Jones Industrial Average
was up 34 points at noon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But oil turned around on a rumor that Iraq was massing
troops on the Jordanian border, and the October contract
closed with a gain of $1.26 a barrel. In turn, the thinly
traded stock market quickly lost steam; the Dow industrials
finished 3.96 points lower at 2615.59.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bonds also declined in response to
the rise in oil prices. The dollar edged higher against most
major currencies, but continued its decline against the yen
on the strength of rising stock prices in Tokyo.
   The weekend superpower meeting put the stock market's
relatively few investors in a good mood. "The most bullish
news was that we got the Russians on our side" in the Mideast
standoff with Iraq, said Kenneth Ducey, a trading official at
S.G. Warburg Securities.
   Rumors of military action in the Middle East were
concentrated in the oil futures pits, but spread fast to
jittery financial markets. Investors are "getting to be kind
of frazzled" by the lingering Mideast tension, said Gary
Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group,
Providence, R.I. "It's hysterics all having to do with oil
prices."
   In Washington, a Pentagon official said the U.S. hasn't
seen any signs of threatening Iraqi troop movements near
Jordan.
   Hugh A. Johnson Jr., chief investment officer at First
Albany, noted that volume remained light. "Most investors I
talk to, large and small, have said it's too risky," he said.
"They feel comfortable with large cash positions and will
stay on the sidelines until there's a resolution in the
Mideast. The light volume is evidence of how uncommitted most
investors are."
   James Solloway, chief economist at Argus Research, said
stocks' volatility yesterday indicates that "nothing has
really changed. We still have a dictator thumbing his nose at
world opinion and staying put in Kuwait."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 119.7 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues led decliners
777 to 739.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell a half of a point, or $5 for each $1,000
of face amount, in light to moderate trading. The yield on
the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.96%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
rose to 1.5820 marks from 1.5679 late Friday and fell to
139.55 yen from 140.05.

   Review of Drexel Prompts SEC to Bolster
   Investigations of Financial Companies

   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
it has stepped up enforcement efforts against financial
companies, stemming from reviews of their public documents in
the wake of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s collapse.
   The efforts, which touch nearly every division at the SEC,
is further fallout from the Drexel Chapter 11 filing and
indicates areas where the SEC wants to fine-tune its
supervision. The agency already has proposed a rule to limit
movements of capital by brokerage houses. "We tried to take a
very careful post mortem at anything we could do" to deal
with similar situations, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said in
an interview. "We tried to learn from it. We would be
derelict if we didn't."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In response to written questions relating to the Drexel
bankruptcy and the junk-bond market, Mr. Breeden said the SEC
is focusing its review process on insurance companies,
publicly held brokerage houses and companies with large
brokerage subsidiaries.
   He said the agency's accounting task force also is
reviewing public filings of "those banking and thrift holding
companies considered to involve the highest degree of risk."
Typically, the agency doesn't disclose what company filings
it reviews. These investigations concentrate largely on how
companies value their junk-bond holdings.
   Mr. Breeden told senators in separate testimony that he
expects the commission to bring charges arising from
investigations by the SEC's savings-and-loan task force.
"There are a fair number of cases the unit is working on,"
Mr. Breeden said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing. "I
think there will be a number of cases where we'll find
certain practices that would not comply with the law." He
wasn't specific about the timing of the cases.
   SEC Enforcement Director William McLucas said the agency
has "quite a number of investigations in our inventory." None
of the cases has been brought yet, he said, but the SEC has
15 professionals plus several accountants "occupied
full-time." But he added that the cases could take a while to
bring because "they are document-intensive."
   The SEC's corporation-finance division also has asked
several financial companies to amend filings to better
reflect "the risks and effects of participating in the
highyield market" and has made "a number of referrals" to the
agency's enforcement division, Mr. Breeden said. Moreover,
the agency has notified junk-bond mutual funds of their
"disclosure obligations" and is monitoring those disclosures,
he added.
   The discussion of stepped-up reviews and enforcement
appears to be a significant step in the post-Drexel era at
the SEC. The once-powerful brokerage house filed for
bankruptcy in February following a steep drop in the
junk-bond market that led to capital problems. The collapse
rippled through the junk-bond market, highlighting additional
risks and pointing up how much information about the market
was controlled by Drexel.
   The agency already has offered for public comment a
proposed rule that would force brokerage firms to notify the
SEC before they shift large amounts of capital. In the Drexel
case, the brokerage house was shipping large amounts of
capital to its parent company to help fend off a liquidity
crunch. When an additional capital shift was denied by the
New York Stock Exchange and the SEC, Drexel's parent was
forced to file for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors.
   Mr. Breeden also said the agency was continuing to look at
investment partnerships that were set up by Drexel and put
money from Drexel employees, among others, into deals
generated by the firm. Those partnerships, which were
lucrative for several Drexel staffers, also are under
investigation by a House subcommittee.
   The SEC chairman also singled out several questionable
trades by Drexel's commodity-trading subsidiary. The unit
made unsecured loans to the parent company by generating
funds through the sale of borrowed commodity positions. For
example, the unit would borrow gold from third parties and
deliver that gold to parties to whom it had previously sold
gold short. Drexel's unit would hedge the short position by
buying futures contracts.
   "The net effect of these transactions was to provide
another source of unsecured financing for the parent
company," Mr. Breeden said, "in a manner that was not typical
of major firms and did involve unusual risk for creditors of
Drexel Trading."
   Looking back at the Drexel collapse, Mr. Breeden said he
wouldn't have engineered any kind of bailout, arguing that
there is no "too big to fail" doctrine for brokerage firms.
But he said the SEC and Big Board might have "suggested" that
Drexel secure back-up credit lines or increase its capital
immediately. Moreover, the agency might have asked Drexel not
to transfer funds to its parent, Mr. Breeden said. Finally,
the agency might have "insisted that Drexel management cancel
the large bonus-payment program when it was announced at
year-end 1989," he said.
   Mr. Breeden is likely to get his chance to do that type of
oversight because Congress is nearing passage of legislation
giving the SEC a better look into the finances of brokerage
firms' parent companies.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Regional Ad Networks May Make
   Hot Copy for Ailing Newspapers

   U.S. newspapers may go the way of the dinosaur unless they
can reverse shrinking advertising volume and sagging
readership. But the industry thinks regional ad networks
could offer an answer.
   More papers big and small are forging such alliances,
hoping to lure big-spending advertisers away from direct
mail, local TV stations and glossy regional magazines. The
networks usually represent either daily or weekly papers
without other business ties. They offer wider population
coverage plus the convenience of one-stop shopping -- often
with a discount -- simpler billing and standardized ad copy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There are now about 200 formal networks across the nation,
twice the number of a decade ago, estimates Herb Partridge,
vice president for sales development at Landon Associates, a
New York firm that handles newspaper advertising. New ad
networks have sprung up in a half-dozen states in recent
months, including New Jersey, California and Massachusetts.
Perhaps the largest is Newspapers First, the result of last
June's merger of networks representing 37 major city dailies
and run by Knight-Ridder and Times Mirror units.
   "I get calls all the time from newspapers around the
country asking for assistance to set one up," says Sandra
Daugherty, manager of the Florida Advertising Network, a
federation created by 19 daily papers last April that claims
to be the first statewide network.
   "There's going to be a proliferation of these networks,"
concurs Jim Wilson, senior vice president of national sales
at the Newspaper Advertising Bureau. "It's simply Marketing
101. We are all trying to get closer to our clients" --
something that newspapers didn't need to do, he adds, when
"we were the only game in town."
   Critics say newspapers command less of the total
advertising pie and fewer national ad dollars these days
partly because they didn't become aggressive marketers as
quickly as rival media outlets. Only 11.4% of newspapers'
$32.4 billion in advertising came from national marketers
last year, down from a peak of about 25% two decades ago.
   The spread of ad networks should help newspapers survive,
"but I don't think the one or two steps taken so far will be
the sole solution to their problems," says Robert Coen,
senior vice president and director of forecasting at
McCann-Erickson.
   Certainly that's been the experience of the Chicago
Sun-Times. Trying to overcome the Chicago Tribune's market
dominance and demographic advantage, Sun-Times Co. formed a
network last year that provides cut-rate space in both the
daily and its two chains of 65 suburban weeklies. A prime
goal: attract new major advertisers.
   The ad network has scored some modest successes. New
business accounted for 45% of its almost $5 million in
revenue during the first year. The newcomers, says Mike
Dacey, Sun-Times's senior vice president of advertising, are
"everything from bridal shops to a guy doing swimming pools."
   Not exactly your heavy-duty ad spenders, however. Mr.
Dacey concedes that few national advertisers have signed up.
"Some of their resistance is centered on the suburban
papers," he says. "They haven't traditionally used them."
Weeklies just aren't viewed as serious publications, other
industry watchers say.
   Dale Buchtel, a Sears Roebuck media buyer, says an ad
network like the Sun-Times's "is nice for small regional
advertisers. But we're a very large national advertiser. I
don't see anything advantageous for us." The retailing giant
runs ads in nearly 1,000 American newspapers every day, and
prefers to deal with each one separately.
   Undaunted, the Sun-Times plans to promote the network with
a nearly $500,000 print and direct-mail campaign starting
this month. Mr. Dacey will bolster the drive with a road show
for ad agencies in several big cities this fall.
   Yet even if newspaper advertising alliances figure out how
to woo a slew of national advertisers, they could face a more
formidable hurdle: the U.S. government. Earlier this summer,
the Justice Department disclosed an investigation as to
whether the Florida network engages in price-fixing. "We are
looking to see whether they are eliminating competition for
advertising" by making it harder for clients to get lower
rates from non-member papers, says Joseph Krovisky, an agency
spokesman.
   Ms. Daugherty of the Orlando-based network denies the
charges. "We feel we can be very competitive and are
responding to advertisers' needs," she says. She insists the
inquiry isn't hurting sales -- even though the network so far
has won only two clients and $100,000 in ads. The manager
suspects the government targeted Florida because it's the
sole statewide network.
   Not so, Mr. Krovisky retorts. The Justice Department just
didn't know there were newspaper advertising networks
elsewhere. Now, he adds, "I couldn't rule out that we
wouldn't investigate" the rest.

   Bunny at the Movies
                                                                                                       

   The Energizer Bunny is marching onto the big screen, this
time to interrupt a preview parody for a fictitious French
film.
   Near the end of the 60-second trailer, titled "Dance With
Your Feet," the bunny barges in on a romantic interlude
between a ballet dancer and her lover. An announcer then
comes on to plug Energizer batteries, which are made by
Ralston Purina's Eveready unit.
   The commercial will run from Sept. 21 to Oct. 18 in movie
theaters nationwide.
   Chiat/Day/Mojo, the agency that created the ad, has also
developed new bunny ads for TV, including parody spots for
"Chug-A-Cherry" soda and "Airdale" air freshener.

   AYER: Jerry Siano, chairman of Ayer, acknowledged that the
shop has had conversations with agencies interested in
acquiring a minority stake or putting together a joint
venture with Ayer. But he denied an Advertising Age report
that Dentsu plans to buy a 40% stake in the agency. He did
say Ayer and Dentsu had previously discussed a joint venture
in Asia, but he declined to comment on whether Ayer and
Dentsu might link in the future. "We have no specific deal
that is being struck at this point," he said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW CAMPAIGN: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, fearful a

   JIDDA, Saudi Arabia -- On page two of the Arab News, just
above the daily listing of Moslem prayer times, a photo shows
a T-shirted U.S. servicewoman maneuvering a forklift as
another soldier looks on. In a country that bans women from
driving, working with men or appearing in public without
head-to-toe veils, the image breaks about every taboo in the
book.
   Yet Khaled al-Maeena, the newspaper's editor, says he
didn't think twice about publishing it. "The gulf crisis has
ushered in a new era in Saudi Arabia," he says. "It has
unleashed things here."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Not everyone likes what's on the loose. At Rabieh Marmou's
beauty parlor, a discreet windowless salon, patrons shed
their veils and share their gripes about U.S. servicewomen.
"Not a single one approves of the women soldiers," Mrs.
Marmou says. "Everyone is sure they are here to provide sex
for the servicemen or, worse, to steal our husbands."
   So it is that King Fahd's decision to invite U.S. troops
to this country has triggered debate all over Saudi Arabia,
and not just about women soldiers. The king's action has
irrevocably altered Saudi foreign policy and the nation's
image in the Arab world. It has exposed an intensely private
society to outside scrutiny and raised questions about the
need for a freer press and a more open political system.
   Ever since the oil boom of the 1970s, Saudi Arabia has
been buffeted by bewildering crosswinds. Petrodollars brought
breakneck modernization to the tribal kingdom. But like a
desert chameleon changing its color, the conservative
monarchy managed to switch its skin without altering its
substance. Saudi Arabia adopted Western technology but
rejected Western values. Its austere, Wahaby version of Islam
and the absolute rule of the al-Saud family remain virtually
unchallenged despite a population increasingly well-educated
and well-traveled.
   The result is a society that, to Westerners, can appear
slightly schizophrenic and filled with baffling
contradictions.
   Sitting beneath diplomas from the Wharton School and
Georgetown University, a Saudi businessman describes as
"obnoxious" a Cable News Network decision to send a woman
reporter to Saudi Arabia. He goes on to express the hope that
U.S. troops remain sequestered on their bases to prevent
"unholy ramifications" from Western contaminants such as
alcohol and female drivers.
   Like many wealthy Saudis, the businessman lives in a
handsome high-walled villa that groups working and living
quarters around a courtyard with fragrant flowers and a
floodlit swimming pool. Showing a guest out, he pauses and
asks, as an afterthought, if she would like to meet a few of
his friends.
   Then, he opens the door on a scene of decadence worthy of
a Fellini movie. In a dimly lit room, a Philippine woman in a
skintight miniskirt gyrates to throbbing American rock as a
white-robed man fondles her rump. On sunken couches, women
caress men, or each other. One, a blond-maned Turk, rises to
pour drinks at a bar stocked with illicit gin, Heineken beer
and Johnnie Walker whiskey -- $135 a bottle on the black
market here.
   Later, Saudis explain that such scenes are a safety valve.
"Anything is available so long as you don't bother your
neighbors," says a Saudi engineer who is, himself, strictly
religious. "Liberals can get what they want, fundamentalists
can get what they want."
   An overwhelming majority of Saudis are, like the engineer,
deeply devout and wholeheartedly approving of their country's
strict, Islamically based legal code that provides flogging
for alcohol consumption and stoning for adultery. Even among
the secular minority, support is high for outward conformity
to Islamic rules. As custodians of Mecca and Medina, the
cities where the prophet Mohammed lived and preached, Saudis
feel that the eyes of a billion Moslems are upon them.
   Most Saudis say they also are satisfied with the country's
political culture, essentially an elaboration of an ancient
tribal system without elections or parliaments. Here, the
complaints of the young are passed to their elders, who in
turn refer problems to tribal leaders. Each member of Saudi
Arabia's royal family of some 5,000 princes has a regular
open house, or Majlis, to which any citizen can come and ask
a favor or offer a criticism.
   "There are princes scattered all over the country,"
explains Mohammed Abudawood, a Jidda-based trader and
industrialist. "So Saudis and their government share common
experiences and common interests." He believes the king's
quick call for American help during the current crisis shows
just how well the system works. "The man knew what he wanted,
and it was what we wanted," Mr. Abudawood says.
   Saudis from all walks of life express support for the U.S.
presence. The clients of Mrs. Marmou, the hair stylist, may
have problems with female soldiers but they don't have any
complaints about the men. "Before they arrived, women were
hysterical," she says. "Some were hallucinating about gas
attacks, screaming that their skin was turning blue." Like
thousands of Saudis, Mrs. Marmou's family sent a cable to
King Fahd, congratulating him on his decision to request U.S.
help.
   But some Saudis feel the current system copes well only
with the trivial problems of local constituencies, and isn't
adequate for the growing complexity of Saudi society.
   "You have to be someone or know someone" to get anything
done, complains a senior Saudi official. In a government
building in Jidda, he reaches for a radio and tunes it to a
station blaring Arabic pop. "I'm sorry, but I want some noise
in the room," he explains, fearing that it might be bugged.
   "OK, we have everything: We can go abroad and stay in
presidential suites. But when my wife goes out shopping here,
she can be harassed" by religious police who chastise or even
cane women who aren't strictly veiled. "And I can't take him
{the policeman} to court. I look at my children and
grandchildren and ask if they are going to live in a place
where law is respected."
   For years now, King Fahd has hinted that he might
establish a Shura, or consultative council, to allow at least
a measure of formal public political participation. He even
erected a chamber for such a council in the capital, Riyadh.
But the building stands empty, and the subject has been
dropped.
   Even Saudis who seek a more open system don't call for the
ouster of the al-Saud family. Ever since 1932, when Abdel
Aziz al-Saud -- the father of the current king -- unified
most of the Arabian peninsula and named it after his family,
the monarchy has proved remarkably durable and adept at
crisis management. In 1964, the princes banded together to
oust incompetent King Saud, their relative. In 1975, they
managed a smooth transition of power after the assassination,
at a Majlis, of King Faisal.
   The current crisis appears to have enhanced King Fahd's
prestige at home, and reinvigorated his leadership. "He had
become lazy," confides a Saudi who knows the king. "He was
like a sophomore, letting things pile up for months then
staying up all night signing papers." Now, the Saudi says,
the king is once again the hands-on manager he was as a young
man, when, as crown prince, he guided the nation through the
oil boom.
   By inviting Americans into Saudi Arabia, the king brought
the public face of Saudi foreign policy in line with the
longtime private reality. For years, the kingdom shared a
tacit alliance with the U.S., based on its need for military
protection and America's appetite for oil. But the symbiosis
was kept generally quiet for fear of damaging Saudi Arabia's
image with its fellow Arab nations.
   Now, the bond with the U.S. has been blatantly exposed
and, for better or worse, Saudis are able to state bluntly
that Americans are friends without looking over their
shoulder at militant Moslems or radical Palestinians. Many
Saudis are breathing sighs of relief. "One thing I will thank
Saddam for forever," says Marwan Abdrabuh, a manager with a
Saudi oil refining company, "is showing us who our real
friends are."
   Rumors abound of recent royal snubs of errant Arab
leaders. Prince Sultan, the defense minister, is said to have
hung up on Yemen's president when he called to complain about
Saudi violations of Yemen's airspace in the last few weeks.
King Fahd reportedly won't even take calls from Jordan's King
Hussein, while the Palestine Liberation Organization's Yasser
Arafat hasn't been allowed in the kingdom for over three
weeks.
   Saudis seem dizzy with delight over this new freedom to
despise their erstwhile Arab allies. Nowhere is this more
apparent than in the Saudi press. "They used to stab at Brits
and Americans," says an American attorney working in Jidda.
"Now they're too busy sticking it to Saddam Hussein."
   Sayidaty, a women's magazine that usually features bright
stories about family life, last week ran a graphic, harrowing
account of a Sudanese woman's rape by Iraqi soldiers in
Kuwait. On Sept. 3, Arab News published excerpts from the
U.S. State Department's 1989 report on human rights in Iraq.
The report, complete with accounts of the gassing and
deportation of minority Kurds in Iraq, has been out since
February, but before the current crisis its publication would
have been unthinkable in Saudi Arabia.
   "I'm extremely upset with Arab media, including myself,"
says Mr. al-Maeena, the Arab News editor. "In the Middle East
the traditional policy was that you didn't criticize an Arab
country. Its internal affairs were its own business. Now the
time has come for each and every one of us to see that the
truth emerges . . . especially if there are human rights
abuses or clear-cut violations of Islamic law."
   But such frankness on domestic issues might have to wait a
while. Asked if he would report on a human rights abuse in
Saudi Arabia, Mr. al-Maeena demurs. "As an editor my duty
would be to see that the authorities know about it," he says.
"I would take the information to the king or to the minister
of the interior.'
   Debate on Saudi economic management also isn't likely to
make the papers, although it is a hot topic around dinner
tables. "We are all asking ourselves where the billions went
that we invested in military spending all these years," says
a manager in Dhahran, who is alarmed that without U.S. help
the kingdom would have been indefensible. At one huge base,
King Khalid Military City, Saudis laid dynamite and were
prepared to destroy the facility rather than let it fall into
Iraqi hands.
   Many Saudis say it's clear enough where the defense
dollars went: building the first-rate infrastructure that has
received and housed the U.S. forces. Still, a number of
officials expect to see a doubling of Saudi military
spending, so that in a future crisis the country's need for
outside help won't be quite so urgent.
   Saudi Arabia should have plenty of money to fund any
military buildup, thanks to higher oil prices and an increase
in its own production. Mr. Abudawood, the Jidda
industrialist, is among those who relish the coming
opportunities. The crisis, he says, "was a surprise, and
business doesn't like surprises." But now, he says, people
have seen the huge force the U.S. is willing to commit to
secure Saudi Arabia. With the might of the U.S. military
massed on its borders, he says, "Saudi Arabia probably is the
safest place on earth."
   But a degree of social insecurity may be part of the
price. Cruising one of the three-lane highways that bisect
the desert, a young Saudi speaks of the new awareness of
human rights he hopes the U.S. presence may bring. Then,
overtaking a U.S. Army jeep, he glimpses pigtails sprouting
from beneath the driver's camouflage cap, slams on the brakes
and stares at the woman. "This isn't good," he says, shaking
his head gravely.

   WASHINGTON -- Top Bush administration officials said
budget negotiations with congressional Democrats are making
little progress toward a deficit-reduction pact.
   "I would say that talks are going nowhere fast," Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady said on ABC's "Good Morning
America." And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters: "We are still hopeful but looking less and less
optimistic."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Democratic negotiators weren't talking, but aides
confirmed that the talks are moving slowly. With little
progress to review, a planned meeting yesterday morning
between President Bush and congressional budget negotiators
was canceled.
   Few details leaked from the fourth day of closed-door
talks at Andrews Air Force Base near here, but longstanding
differences about raising income-tax rates and cutting
capital-gains-tax rates were reportedly aired. Much of the
day was consumed by intraparty caucuses.
   Some Democrats are uneasy about the possibility that Mr.
Bush will criticize them in his televised address to Congress
on the Middle East crisis scheduled for 9 p.m. today. But Mr.
Fitzwater said, "I don't expect any strong criticism in the
speech, rather it will be more geared to laying out our
objectives . . . why especially in view of the Persian Gulf
situation it's important that the U.S. put its domestic house
in order."
   Without some agreement to reduce the deficit or alter the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, about $85 billion in
across-the-board spending cuts will be triggered Oct. 1.

   The U.S. formally asked its European allies to commit some
ground-based troops to the Persian Gulf and to provide cargo
ships and planes to move more Arab troops and weapons to the
area.
   The two requests, and several others, were presented by
Secretary of State James Baker at a meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. They came as Iraq
moved to shore up its standing in the international community
by agreeing to restore full diplomatic relations with Iran
and offering to give away oil to Third World countries if
those countries can arrange to pick it up.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the Brussels meeting, several NATO allies immediately
agreed to lend some ships and airplanes to carry fresh
Egyptian troops to Saudi Arabia, to join the huge military
buildup there aimed at reversing Iraq's occupation of Kuwait
and deterring a move into Saudi Arabia.
   The allies also agreed to consider the secretary of
state's call to send some of their own ground-based troops to
Saudi Arabia. Washington seeks mainly small, symbolic
deployments of such troops to add to the U.S.-led force
confronting Iraq.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Baker disclosed that he will fly Thursday
to Syria -- a bitter foe of Iraq -- to try to cement the
U.S.-Arab coalition against Baghdad. He is making the trip
even though Damascus has provided sanctuary for terrorists
who have killed hundreds of Americans in recent years.
   No high-ranking U.S. official has called on Syrian
President Hafez Assad since before the December 1988 bombing
of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 281 people. The U.S. believes the bombing was carried
out on behalf of Iran by Palestinian terrorists whom Mr.
Assad's regime sponsors.
   Syria has sent troops to Saudi Arabia and has supported
the U.S. presence there.
   In a news conference after his meeting with the European
allies, Mr. Baker also made a major disclosure on a separate
issue -- conventional arms control. He said the U.S. has
agreed with the Soviet Union to limit U.S. forces in Europe,
under a pending conventional-arms pact, to a figure lower
than the 195,000 agreed to by the superpowers in Ottawa last
winter. He didn't specify the new figure.
   With the Soviets pledged to remove all their troops from
Germany under a German-Soviet pact signed in July, Mr. Baker
said, the Ottawa accord has been "overtaken by events" and
the U.S. troop level is "up in the air." He is expected to
discuss the issue with Soviet officials this week in Moscow,
where he flew after his news conference in the Belgian
capital.
   The U.S. proposals to the NATO allies, if acted upon,
would help to increase Iraq's international isolation, draw
Western Europe deeper into the military aspect of the
anti-Iraq effort and begin to respond to criticism within the
U.S. that major allies aren't exposing their troops to the
risk of ground fighting in the Middle East being faced by
U.S. forces.
   Mr. Baker hopes his trip to Damascus will be a powerful
sign to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that his enemies are
willing to patch up their differences to take him on. To try
to fuel such fears in Baghdad, Mr. Baker publicly praised
Iran's professed willingness to abide by sanctions against
Iraq.
   The secretary also appeared to add to the publicly stated
goals of the anti-Iraq effort by calling for "intrusive"
international controls "to diminish the threat of Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction." And he said "other measures"
will be needed if "an outlaw like Saddam Hussein can be only
years away from having a nuclear capability." He refused to
define the "other measures" and appeared to be leaving the
impression that the U.S. might consider destroying Iraq's
nuclear and chemical weapons plants, as some members of
Congress have urged.
   Mr. Baker said Iraq's Persian Gulf neighbors have agreed
to contribute $12 billion to the anti-Baghdad effort through
the end of 1990. Half of that sum, he said, would go to cover
the U.S.'s added military costs stemming from the Gulf
crisis. The rest would be used to help countries such as
Egypt and Turkey, which have been hurt by the world-wide
trade embargo against Iraq.
   Mr. Baker raised the funds on a Persian Gulf swing last
weekend but didn't disclose the total amount until yesterday.
   Iraq's agreement with Iran to reopen embassies in each
other's country came as Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was
in Tehran to nail down details of a peace agreement formally
ending the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. But the decision may have
little more than symbolic importance. Iran and Iraq never
formally broke diplomatic ties during their war and even
maintained embassies in each other's capitals from the time
the war broke out until 1986.
   At the same time that Iran was agreeing to reopen
diplomatic ties yesterday, it was reaffirming its opposition
to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and seizure of Kuwait. Iraq clearly
hopes that Iran now will help circumvent the trade embargo
against it, but there's no sign yet that Iran will do so.
   Iraq's offer to give away oil to Third World countries, in
a statement by Saddam Hussein read on Iraqi television, was
aimed at driving a wedge between poor nations and rich ones
supporting the campaign against Iraq. The message said Iraq
and Third World countries are "brothers" because of the
poorer nations' "evenhanded" policies on Arab issues.
   But Iraq said Third World countries would have to figure
out for themselves how to pick up any oil, as the
international trade embargo and a U.S.-led blockade have
stopped Iraqi tankers from carrying oil out.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed both
Iraq's move toward Iran and its offer to give away oil. "The
desperation attempts, reaching out to Iran and this free oil
for the Third World, indicate that the pressure is pinching
them someplace," Mr. Fitzwater said. He said that even
picking up oil at no charge would violate the embargo.
   Mr. Baker, in addition to requesting troops and cargo
craft from the NATO allies, said he asked the Europeans to
activate an emergency alliance planning committee to
coordinate allied aid in the Gulf crisis, move naval vessels
to the eastern Mediterranean, deploy radar control planes in
southern Europe, aid Turkey and Eastern Europe, and airlift
refugees from Jordan.
   He said Greece and Denmark had agreed to provide cargo
ships, West Germany would provide unspecified sea and air
transport, the Netherlands would supply more gear to defend
against chemical weapons, and Belgium would send aircraft to
Egypt for evacuating refugees.
   Some of the latest U.S. steps could prompt domestic
political criticism. For one thing, Mr. Baker said he would
be satisfied with "symbolic" small troop deployments by the
allies and that the forces they contribute needn't be army
combat units.
   He referred to them as "ground-based" rather than "ground"
forces, and he implied that other allies might imitate
Britain, whose troops on the ground in the Gulf are pilots
and maintenance crews who operate a squadron of fighter jets,
plus troops to defend them. That wouldn't satisfy
congressional and other critics who are demanding large
allied participation on the ground.
   In addition, the Baker visit to Syria is sure to spur
criticism. At his news conference, Mr. Baker testily denied
the trip would undermine U.S. anti-terrorism policy.
   "We still have difficulties with Syria," he said, and he
insisted that "we will use the occasion of this visit to
discuss those difficulties with them as well." He said
improved U.S.-Syrian relations would depend on changes in
Syrian behavior and that strains between the two countries
wouldn't be "cured overnight" by their mutual stand against
Iraq.
   Meanwhile, the State Department said 161 Americans who
were stranded in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait for more than a month
arrived yesterday afternoon in Baltimore. The passengers left
Baghdad Sunday on an Iraqi charter jet and spent the night in
London, where three other Americans left the flight to join
family or friends in the British capital.

   Pact to Sell Lasers
   In Japan Reached

   HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp. entered into
a marketing agreement with a Japanese company to sell
high-power laser systems in Japan, opening a major market for
this emerging technology.
   In recent years low-power lasers have been replacing
conventional tools for cutting sheet metal and welding. As
with many other technologies invented in the U.S., the
Japanese have been in the forefront in integrating lasers
into their manufacturing processes. The pact with a leading
developer of high-power lasers will "give them . . .
significant advantage" in their manufacturing costs, said
Edward Peters, who follows lasers at the consulting firm
Arthur D. Little Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   High-power lasers can cut thicker materials and can weld
more precisely and at higher speeds than low-end lasers,
allowing significant manufacturing flexibility. The recently
commercialized technology hasn't attracted many takers in the
U.S., however. "The demand isn't as intense as in Japan and
Europe," said Jeffrey Carstens, general manager of United
Technologies Industrial Lasers. "That's one reason we want a
presence in Japan."
   Under the agreement, Hanwa Co. in Tokyo will market and
distribute United Technologies' carbon dioxide lasers, whose
powers will range between 10 and 25 kilowatts. Most lasers in
use in Japan produce less than one kilowatt, and the
highest-power laser available from Japanese companies is in
the 10-kilowatt range.
   In Japan, the market for industrial lasers was $200
million last year. "We expect the Japanese market for
high-power lasers to expand by over 400% in five years," said
Shigeru Kita, president of Hanwa.
   Mr. Carstens said that the lasers will be supplied from
the U.S. and that there are no plans for joint production
because of the size of the market. A five-kilowatt laser
costs $460,000. A 25-kilowatt version is priced at $1
million.
   Arthur D. Little's Mr. Peters said that laser applications
are also likely to get a major boost from European
manufacturers. Under a plant modernization program, European
Community members have singled out high-power lasers to
increase manufacturing efficiency and are spending tens of
millions of dollars on laser technology, he said.
   Mr. Peters estimated that the world market for industrial
lasers totaled $830 million in 1988, with Japan accounting
for 40% of all installed industrial lasers, the U.S. 33% and
Europe 27%. He said he expects the world market to grow 8% to
10% annually through 1994.

   NEW YORK -- The yen overpowered all other currencies
yesterday as Japanese investors who had forsaken their home
market all year exchanged their foreign-currency profits into
yen.
   "Window dressing" was the talk of trading rooms as
insurance companies and other big institutions moved to
decorate their balance sheets before the close of a
particularly tough fiscal first half on Sept. 30.

<TEXT>
   The biggest losers for the day were those currencies that
had recently been seen as attractive investments --
continental European currencies and "high-yielders," such as
the pound and the Canadian and Australian dollars, that are
backed by high domestic interest rates.
   Coming in second was the dollar, which rose against the
sold-off currencies because of its role as a medium for cross
transactions. For example, investors trading marks for yen
will often pass through dollars to take advantage of the
greater breadth of the dollar market.
   But the greenback also exhibited some independent strength
and ended global trading off only half a yen. The dollar was
pushed briefly below 139 yen, but bounced back after finding
support at 138.75 yen.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
139.55 yen, down from 140.05 yen late Friday in New York. But
the U.S. currency rose to 1.5820 marks and 1.3165 Swiss
francs from 1.5679 marks and 1.3055 francs in New York late
Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 140.23 yen, up from 139.43 yen at the close there Monday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5784
marks, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.5710 marks.
   Sterling was trading at $1.8575, down from $1.8930 late
Friday. The Canadian dollar fell to 85.71 U.S. cents from
85.98 U.S. cents, while the Australian dollar slipped to
81.22 U.S. cents from 82.23 cents.
   At their recent peaks a little over two weeks ago, the
pound was only four cents shy of $2, while the Canadian and
Australian dollars were at 88.5 cents and 83.5 cents
respectively.
   The yen's performance yesterday was much stronger against
non-dollar currencies.
   For example, among continental European currencies, the
mark fell to 88.211 yen from 89.323 yen Friday. Among
high-yield currencies, the pound dropped to 259.21 yen from
265.11 yen late Friday.
   Kiyohiko Yoshizawa, a pound and yen trader for the U.K.'s
Midland Montagu in New York, said the market is seeing the
yen version of what happened to the dollar late last year.
   Following the New York Stock Exchange's minicrash last
October, Mr. Yoshizawa said, U.S. investors brought home
profits from foreign investments to cover their losses.
Accordingly, the dollar gained last fall.
   Japanese investors, he said, are following the same path
now, making up for devastating reversals on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange last spring and last month. "Major Japanese
investors must buy yen," Mr. Yoshizawa said. "They need yen
right now."
   Mr. Yoshizawa, agreeing with many traders in Asia, said
this will be the week when most cash will be brought home to
Japan. Companies face internal reporting deadlines that
precede the month-end close of the fiscal half, he said.
"This is the week of the real buying."
   Come Oct. 1, the yen may drop. Institutions have been
known to put their money right back where it was after the
close of the fiscal half.
   But the dollar's chances against the yen are threatened
not only by the prospect of a U.S. recession but by
credit-easing to ward off such a recession. Returning from a
whirlwind tour around the world to find financial support for
the U.S. military deployment in Saudia Arabia, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady repeated his oftstated opinion that
U.S. interest rates should be lower.
   Also working in the yen's favor is the general easing of
Persian Gulf tensions following the show of solidarity in
Helsinki by President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Meanwhile, sentiment is split on the mark. Some German
technicians are pointing to a ceiling for the dollar at
1.5875 marks. "The dollar is near sell levels now" against
the mark, warned a Frankfurt dealer.
   But others aren't so sure. "It's looking bad for" the
mark, said Claus Wagner, chief trader at Citibank in
Frankfurt. "I really believe we've seen the worst for the
dollar. We've seen all the bad news. If a currency is going
to weaken, it's the mark."
   Ian Foakes, foreign-exchange manager at PaineWebber, noted
that the market is always uncomfortable with a weak dollar.
Because so many people have a finger in the U.S. pie, a weak
dollar and a weak U.S. economy are painful to everyone.
Foreign-exchange volume "really started to peter out" as the
dollar fell to its recent record low against the mark, he
said.
   The dollar ended European trading mostly higher. Dealers
said dollar activity was sparse, as the market's attention
had turned squarely on the yen.
   In Asian trading, the dollar ended mixed, as funds
continued to flow into the yen from European currencies. The
greenback was last quoted in Tokyo Monday at 139.43 yen, down
from 140.25 yen late Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery plunged $10.90 to $378.60 an ounce. The close was
the lowest since Aug. 3. Estimated volume was a heavy five
million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $378.25 an ounce.

   Pennsylvania Lawmakers to Consider
   Specialized Court for Business Matters

   PHILADELPHIA -- After passing the toughest anti-takeover
law in the nation earlier this year, Pennsylvania lawmakers
will consider another measure that could make the state more
attractive to corporations: a specialized court system for
business litigation.
   A bill filed yesterday with the Pennsylvania State Senate
would create a special chancery court patterned after the
Delaware Court of Chancery. That court is the only one in the
country specializing in corporate legal matters, such as
hostile takeovers and shareholder suits. The court's
expertise and reputation for liberal business laws have done
much to establish Delaware as the nation's foremost corporate
host.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania's proposed law, which goes further than
Delaware's in one key respect, has yet to be formally
introduced in the Senate chamber and isn't likely to be acted
on before the state legislature adjourns Nov. 30. It was
filed by State Sen. H. Craig Lewis, a Democrat from Bucks
County, outside Philadelphia, at the behest of several
business and legal groups, including the Philadelphia Bar
Association.
   "This is the first step in the process of getting people
to focus on it," said William E. Zeiter, a corporate law
specialist in the Philadelphia office of Morgan, Lewis &amp;
Bockius who helped draft the measure.
   The proposed law in Pennsylvania would create a court for
nonjury trials before appointed judges who specialize in
business law, as in Delaware. But Delaware's court deals only
with matters of corporate governance and requests for court
orders and injunctions, so-called equity matters.
Pennsylvania's chancery court would have exclusive
jurisdiction not only in such matters but also in suits for
damages in commercial disputes where the contested amount
exceeds $500,000.
   That provision is the most controversial aspect of the
proposed law and is one of several items that would require
amending the state's constitution. Pennsylvania, like all
states, guarantees the right to a jury trial in all civil
disputes.
   "Because the proposal is so new, it has received little
debate in the Legislature. Its sponsors are uncertain what
political support it will receive or how a final version of
the bill will look," said Mr. Zeiter. The provision doing
away with jury trials in commercial litigation that involves
amounts exceeding $500,000 is sure to be controversial, he
added.
   Nevertheless, the proposed law already has been warmly
received by influential business and legal groups that see
specialized business courts as increasingly important. The
English, Swiss and German judicial systems, for example, all
have separate courts with judges who specialize in commercial
matters.
   "We think it's a very good idea to have a court which is
made up of judges and support people who are versed in
corporate law," said Jay H. Tolson, chairman of the
Pennsylvania Business Roundtable, an association of business
executives from 42 of the state's biggest corporations.
   Delaware's Court of Chancery is often cited as the premier
reason why so many companies -- nearly half those listed on
the New York Stock Exchange -- are incorporated there.
Pennsylvania, by contrast, can claim only 4%. But backers of
Pennsylvania's proposed law say the measure isn't aimed
solely at competing with Delaware. "The main benefit is to
offer expeditious judicial review of corporate legal
matters," said Ruth E. Ganister, head of the Philadelphia Bar
Association's business law section.
   The average civil suit filed in Philadelphia takes five
years to work through the city's Court of Common Pleas. The
same case filed in Pittsburgh takes an average of three
years, said Mrs. Ganister.
   The Pennsylvania Senate Judiciary Committee tentatively
scheduled a public hearing on the bill for tomorrow. But no
further action is expected until the Legislature begins its
1991 session in January.
   Because the proposal involves amending the state's
constitution, it will have to win approval by a two-thirds
vote of both houses of the Legislature, or majority votes in
both houses during two consecutive sessions, before the
public would vote in a referendum.
   "As is typical in Pennsylvania," said Mrs. Ganister, "this
will require a fairly lengthy process."

   FOXBORO, Mass. -- Moving quickly after completing its
$656.4 million acquisition of Foxboro Corp., Siebe PLC said
it plans to fire 1,600 Foxboro employees, or nearly 25% of
the work force.
   Foxboro, a maker of industrial controls, had been
unprofitable in three of the last five years. After the
company put itself up for sale earlier this year, Siebe, a
Windsor, U.K., engineering concern, won the bid at a price
that many analysts called surprisingly high.

   A Foxboro spokesman said that about 800 of the firings
will be among the 4,000 employees in Massachusetts, a state
already battered by downturns in high technology, defense and
construction. In addition, Siebe said that Gary K. Willis,
Foxboro president and chief executive officer, was fired.
   The remainder of the firings will be at Foxboro facilities
around the world, including one in England.

   Wall Street Races to Cash In on the Privatization Boom

   In U.S. Takeover Drought,
   Investment Bankers Hop
   Globe in Search of Deals

   NEW YORK -- Wall Street investment bankers, hungry for
deals during a prolonged U.S. takeover drought, are flying
around the world, trying to cash in on a boom in the sale of
state-owned companies.
   Known as privatizations, such sales are gathering momentum
in Latin America, Asia and Europe. The boom follows a series
of successful sales of government-owned companies in Britain
starting in 1984.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This year alone, several Wall Street firms have advised
sellers of state-owned telephone companies. Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. is advising the governments of Mexico and Puerto Rico,
First Boston Corp. represented New Zealand, and Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. advised Argentina.
   The state-owned companies may be sold outright to
private-sector companies in the same industry. For example,
the New Zealand phone company is being sold to two U.S.
regional telephone companies. Or they may be sold to
investors in public stock offerings, as British companies
have been.
   Bruce Bockmann, the investment banker responsible for
privatizations at Morgan Stanley, a unit of Morgan Stanley
Group Inc., says some industry estimates are that state-owned
companies valued at more than $200 billion may be put up for
sale over the next five to 10 years.
   To be sure, no one believes the fees involved will
entirely make up for the slowdown in lucrative
mergers-and-acquisitions work on Wall Street. The
privatization deals are labor-intensive and may take years to
complete. But the billion-dollar size of some of them offers
the chance of big paychecks.
   "With the slowdown in the M&amp;A market, this is an area
whose time has come on a global basis," says Charles Murphy,
head of the investment banking group at First Boston, a unit
of CS First Boston Inc. He has teams pursuing such business
in Eastern Europe and South America.
   Mike Overlock, head of mergers and acquisitions at Goldman
Sachs, says the firm's teams advising Mexico and Puerto Rico
on their telephone sales involve M&amp;A people, corporate
finance and other investment bankers. But because the clients
are governments, instead of corporations, he adds, the deals
"are more complex and have more issues."
   Behind the boom in privatizations is a rightward tilt in
world politics that envisions a reduced role for government
in nations' economies. While the most striking example of
this trend is the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe,
most of the biggest sales of state companies are in
capitalist countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
   "The preference for a market economy, moving away from
government enterprises, is sweeping the world," says Lewis
Kaden, a partner at the New York law firm Davis Polk &amp;
Wardwell, which is advising Puerto Rico on its telephone
sale.
   Rodney Lord, editor of Privatisation International, a
London newsletter, says privatization is occurring "on a
wider scale than in the mid-1980s," when the conservative
Thatcher government sold British government stakes in gas,
oil, steel, airlines and telephone concerns.
   Last year's biggest deal was the sale of 10 British water
companies to the public for $8.38 billion, according to
Privatisation International. In recent years, France and
Spain also have sold major industrial concerns.
   Many of those stock offerings proved lucrative bonanzas
for Wall Street. But one of them also highlighted the
enormous risks involved. Four U.S. securities firms had
losses of about $75 million apiece in 1987 when the stock
market crashed in the middle of a $12.33 billion offering of
British Petroleum Co.
   Mr. Lord notes that several Latin American countries,
including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, are pursuing
privatization programs as a way of reducing debts they piled
up during the 1970s and now can't pay.
   One example of how this works occurred recently when
Morgan Stanley advised the Argentine government on the sale
of its state-owned telephone company. The two buyers, groups
led by Telefonica S.A. of Spain and Bell Atlantic Corp. of
Philadelphia, will acquire 60%; employees and the public will
get the rest.
   The two groups that won the bidding, both of which
included banks that held Argentine debt, put up packages of
cash and Argentine debt totaling about $800 million, and made
commitments for future capital spending levels. Though the
Argentine debt's face amount was $5 billion, it was exchanged
for phone company stock at a discounted value of only $550
million.
   Other countries are selling state-owned companies to
reduce government budget deficits, according to Thomas
Keesee, an international investment banker at First Boston.
Indeed, many of the industries most often affected, such as
telecommunications and airlines, face heavy capital spending
requirements that governments may be eager to avoid.
   Investment bankers say their fees for handling
privatizations are generally less than they would receive for
corporate mergers or stock offerings of the same size, even
though privatizations may involve more work. On Wall Street,
investment banks typically charge fees of about 0.5% of the
value of a big merger, and 2% to 3% of a big stock offering.
   For investors, buying into a state-owned company may pose
some special risks. The political winds may shift, and a
privatized company may be nationalized all over again. As
recently as the early 1980s, France nationalized dozens of
companies after the Socialist government of Francois
Mitterrand came to power.
   If a company is nationalized again, the owners may be
compensated, but only at a price negotiated with the
government itself -- hardly conditions for a home-run
investment.

   Computer users don't have an unrestricted right to
duplicate copyrighted software, even if it is for their own
use, a U.S. district court judge ruled in Philadelphia.
   The ruling sets a narrow standard for "fair use" of
copyrighted software, and is likely to set a precedent in an
area of law that hasn't been extensively litigated,
intellectual property, attorneys said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There are still many questions about how you can
legitimately copy software," said Ron Laurie, an attorney at
Irell &amp; Manella, Century City, Calif. "For example, can you
copy it only for use as intended by the manufacturer? I can
see this decision being applied in that context. What this
does is set some limits on copying."
   Current copyright law allows users to copy software when
loading it into a computer; for archival purposes; and for
legitimate "adaptations," copies that have been modified so
much that they qualify as unique.
   While a working definition of "adaptation" hasn't been
hammered out in the courts, last week's decision appears to
rule out any modification that has been made for the
commercial gain of a user or third party, attorneys said.
   The ruling, by Judge Thomas N. O'Neill Jr., came in a case
that started in 1985 as an antitrust complaint filed by
Allen-Myland Inc., a Philadelphia firm that modifies
mainframe computers, against International Business Machines
Corp., the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant. In 1988, Judge
O'Neill found in favor of IBM on most of the antitrust
charges; he dismissed the remaining claim last week.
   IBM raised the copyright issue in counterclaims when it
alleged that Allen-Myland had illegally copied its microcode
-- software wired into a computer's chips -- to modify models
of IBM's 3090 mainframe computers owned by Allen-Myland
customers. IBM said Allen-Myland should have bought extra
copies of the microcode instead of copying it. "We feel this
sets a very important precedent in intellectual property
law," said a spokesman for IBM, which has been increasingly
aggressive in the area.
   Larry Allen, president of Allen-Myland, said his company
plans to appeal at least part of the verdict, which exposes
Allen-Myland to potential losses of as much as $10 million.
"The question is: Do I have to pay IBM for copying something
that {an Allen-Myland customer} owns, even if I'm copying it
so I can modify it for that person's exclusive use?" Mr.
Allen said. "I don't think that's fair."

   FAMILY-LEAVE LAW in New Jersey challenged by business
coalition.
   A coalition of business groups, which include the state
chamber of commerce and a retail merchants association,
launched a constitutional challenge to New Jersey's new
family-leave law, one of the most liberal in the nation.
   The business groups filed suit yesterday against the state
and several officials, alleging that the statute conflicts
with the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(ERISA).
   The New Jersey law, which went into effect in May,
requires companies with more than 100 employees to provide 12
weeks of unpaid leave with benefits every two years to
employees because of the birth or adoption of a child or a
serious illness in their immediate family. In later years,
businesses with fewer employees would also be affected.
   But the plaintiffs maintain that the costliest mandate,
health insurance benefits for employees on leave, conflicts
with ERISA rules regarding all employee welfare benefit
plans.
   According to the suit, filed in New Jersey Superior Court
in Trenton, ERISA explicitly "does not mandate that employers
provide any particular benefits." But because ERISA doesn't
explicitly state that such benefits can't be mandated, the
defendants are likely to argue that it doesn't prevent the
state from requiring them.
   The ERISA challenge is particularly strong because of
Congress's explicit desire to craft a single national
standard to govern employees and employers, says Steven W.
Suflas, a labor lawyer with Archer &amp; Greiner in Haddonfield,
N.J. "You have an express statement within the statute that
ERISA supersedes state law," Mr. Suflas said.
   A spokesman for the New Jersey division of civil rights, a
defendant in the suit, said he hadn't seen a copy of the
complaint and couldn't comment on it.
   Recent efforts to change federal law failed when President
Bush vetoed family-leave legislation.

Paribas; Citibank; and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. The
litigation plans were revealed in a letter from the
bondholders committee's lawyer, Jonathan M. Jacobson, to
lawyers for Allied.
   Allied and Federated filed for bankruptcy court protection
on Jan. 15.
   Allied bondholders hope to recover some $500 million from
Allied's sale of Ann Taylor in 1989 and $193 million from its
sale of Brooks Brothers in 1988. They claim the money was
improperly funneled through a network of holding companies to
creditors of Campeau Corp. U.S. Inc., now known as Federated
Stores Inc. The bondholders say the money should have gone
into Allied's own coffers.
   The bondholders were required to give Allied 30 days
notice before filing suit. "Our investigation is at the point
where we believe it's clear to us that the claims are
meritorious," said Mr. Jacobson. "It makes no sense to wait
further before beginning this process because waiting further
will in our view delay the reorganization of Allied and
Federated."
   In his letter to Allied, Mr. Jacobson said the filing of
the suit would be postponed if it looked as if the claims
would be resolved without litigation.
   David Heiman, counsel to Allied and Federated, said that
he would file a motion with U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge J.
Vincent Aug Jr. in Cincinnati asking him to defer the
lawsuit. Mr. Heiman said it was "premature to file the
litigation now without giving the debtors a chance to see if
we can't negotiate resolution of these claims rather than
proceed to formal litigation."
   In documents filed with the bankruptcy court, Allied
maintained that "a negotiated compromise holds promise for
bringing value to the estate expeditiously, economically and
fairly" and that "immediate litigation would result only in
obduracy, hardened positions and resulting delay."
   Bruce Bennett, lead counsel to Federated Stores Inc. and
special counsel to Campeau, said: "We disagree with the legal
contentions set forth in the letter. . . . We will continue
our efforts to propose and negotiate plans of reorganization
for the debtors which are acceptable to all affected
constituencies. If acceptable plans cannot be confirmed, it
may be that a court will have to decide the merits of this
controversy."
   Henry Weisburg, an attorney for Citibank, said, "The vast
majority of the allegations in the letter are unrelated to
Citibank. Those that relate to Citibank are totally without
merit."
   Lawyers for Bank of Montreal said they couldn't comment.
Counsel for Banque Paribas and DeBartolo couldn't be reached.
   Judge Aug is expected to hold a hearing on the issue Sept.
27.

   EX-GOVERNORS to track state tax and regulatory matters for
law-firm clients.
   Seventeen former governors now in private practice
gathered in Washington yesterday to announce the creation of
the National Resource Center for State Laws and Regulations.
Based in Raleigh, N.C., the nonprofit organization will issue
papers on tax and regulatory developments in 50 states,
incorporating political analysis by former state officials.
   Among the ex-governors who will participate are Jim Hunt
of North Carolina, William Winter of Mississippi and Philip
Noel of Rhode Island.
   The center's seed money is a $150,000 grant from the State
Capital Law Firm Group, a bar organization that monitors
information about developments in state government.
Corporations and trade associations are being solicited by
mail to become dues-paying members, according to the center's
chairman, J. Phil Carlton, a former associate justice of the
North Carolina Supreme Court. Members will receive the policy
papers on a regular basis.
   The former state officials who provide the analysis in the
policy papers won't receive a fee for this work but will be
paid if members desire more detailed information.
   Moreover, "there's a potential to generate new clients"
through the center, says former Gov. Noel, whose law firm,
McGovern, Noel, Falk, Pannone, Proccacini, &amp; O'Leary, does
some lobbying work in Providence. R.I.

July. That means that for every $100 dollars of products
shipped in August, manufacturers received $99 of new orders.

   High-Definition TV Gives Opera Brilliant New Focus

   New York -- Years ago, when I first began writing about
the opera for this paper, I used to sit behind the music
critic from the New York Post, who invariably beat me to the
door. We never talked much, but I did notice that nobody
could run and write as fast as Speight Jenkins. He broke all
speed records escaping Fatlinde and her friends, and one day
just never came back.
   He went to Seattle in 1983. Even more enviable, he became
general director of the Seattle Opera, in a startling
transformation that keeps many of his onetime colleagues
eyeing the Met whenever the top job becomes available, which
has been rather often these days. Reports filtering back
suggested Mr. Jenkins was achieving worthy things in his new
home, including an adventurous "Ring" cycle.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Just how well Mr. Jenkins has been doing in Seattle was
evident when the company staged Prokofiev's "War and Peace"
in July. Featuring a huge Soviet-American cast, the staging
by Francesca Zambello with sets by John Conklin, reached the
level of excellence you would like to see more often in New
York. Seattle had to add an extra performance to contain the
crowds; critics slowed their pace to the doors and wrote
contented stories about this massively challenging $2.5
million undertaking, which suggested, at least to visitors
from Back East, that the torture of travel was a small price
to pay to escape the torture of tedium.
   As the Russian people pressed triumphantly to the ramparts
to sing of their victory over the invading Napoleon, you did
not wish the opera to end. And in a way it didn't, thanks to
an Australian-born high-risk pregnancy doctor and an American
music-video promoter. Both convinced a dubious Mr. Jenkins
that what they really wanted to do with every penny they had
was to make a high-definition tape of "War and Peace."
   A few months ago, Mr. Jenkins had never heard of
high-definition television (HD). As the owner of a box that
predates remote control, I wasn't much better informed. So
the other day I went down to Rebo Studio in New York to see
why Mr. Jenkins was so excited about his HD "War and Peace,"
which was at that moment being edited by Ms. Zambello.
   I know it has its place in the dissemination of culture,
but I usually work hard to avoid seeing opera on television,
with its inevitable scenes of heaving sweat-heaps exposing
pinkish gums in some of the most frightening closeups seen on
television outside of National Geographic specials on the
feeding habits of the warrior ant.
   Just exactly what HDTV is, the high-risk pregnancy doctor,
Robin J. Willcourt, was only too happy to explain as he
removed his improvised headband, a piece of thin metal tape.
   If he wore an entire 63-minute tape, I would be looking at
$1,500, he explained. That's about seven times the cost of
regular videotape, but compared with conventional television,
HDTV offers more than twice the number of vertical lines per
frame, he went on. HD means crisp, dimensional pictures with
the color resolution of 35-mm film.
   Even the one-eyed Marshal Kutuzov would have sung the
praises of the sumptuous images of St. Petersburg society
just then filling the monitor. In a white 18th-century
mansion illuminated by yellow flickering candlelight, Prince
Andrei and Natasha Rostova slowly began to waltz on a
glistening green marble floor. Swirling couples passed them
by, their graceful movement captured as if by painter's
brush. Even better, taking advantage of HD's unusually wide
format, Ms. Zambello emphasized the epic aspect of the piece,
keeping close-ups to midriff, and staying out of Natasha's
dentalwork.
   It was HD's incredible detail and true-to-life colors that
first intrigued Dr. Willcourt when he was making medical
films for teaching purposes and found conventional TV
disappointing for the display of body parts. During the
editing, Dr. Willcourt briefly disappeared to deliver preterm
triplets at his hospital in Seattle. But this is a line of
work he is now abandoning, having emerged from his
self-described midlife crisis as the president of the
software company HD Pacific.
   A young man in shorts came into the editing room with
sushi dinner and began making phone calls to Atlanta. Douglas
S. Cerrone, co-founder and vice-president of HD Pacific, used
to do marketing and promotion for MCA Records, and consulting
for Motown Records, the outfit responsible for keeping Renata
Tebaldi out of Tower Records's front bins and the Supremes
in. Similarily, Mr. Cerrone evaded opera his whole life
because he was bothered by the singing. Now he is a changed
man, having entered the arcane old world of opera through the
new medium of HD.
   In Atlanta, Mr. Cerrone found just what he needed: a reel
of HD tape left over from the Hospital Satellite Network's
breast-surgery program. It will be flown up to Newark by
morning for use in "War and Peace." In the making of
Prokofiev's near-four-hour epic featuring a cast of 250, HD
Pacific pretty much depleted tape stock in America.
   Equipment remains expensive ($200,000 for a lens; $500,000
for a videotape recorder) and hard to come by. The pieces are
essentially hand made in Japan, and Rebo is one of the very
few production studios in the U.S. that has supplemented
conventional TV equipment with HD technology. But in Europe
and especially Japan, the consumer electronics industry is
betting on HD as the medium of the '90s -- and another
technological weapon with which to beat up on the slow-mo
U.S.A. We are, of course, lagging way behind in development
and application.
   It seems that many years will pass before home TVs will
come down to, say, $1,500. And when the U.S. finally gets
around to adopting a transmission standard it likely will be
lower than Japan's or Europe's. Barry Rebo, who heads up Rebo
Studio, tells me that the dream of a universal standard has
already been lost. At the same time, shooting in HD is
steadily increasing, particularly in the realm of
commercials. At Rebo I saw some pretty dazzling special
effects and montages that would cost more and take weeks of
studio manipulation if done with film or video.
   The interesting thing is that all HD programming,
including "War and Peace," can be "downconverted" for showing
on regular TV sets. Similarly, 35-mm movies can be
transferred to HD -- though in that transfer, Dr. Willcourt
says, there is no loss in quality.
   In fact, he first met Mr. Cerrone standing in front of a
huge screen that was playing an HD transfer of the Michael J.
Fox movie "Back to the Future" at a Las Vegas HD exposition.
Isn't that an incredible picture, one man gasped to the
other, and last February they formed HD Pacific to make some
of their own.
   "War and Peace" is their first venture. Dr. Willcourt, who
unlike his sidekick sometimes hums the beginnings of arias,
had hoped to tape Seattle's visually stunning "Ring" cycle,
but when the company's plans changed, he was even more taken
by the prospect of doing an opera about the triumph over
oppression featuring Russians who could sing from experience.
And unlike the "Ring," which is tricky to hum, "War and
Peace" has some catchy stuff, including a booming tune for
Marshal Kutuzov and some rousing choruses. Had Prokofiev, who
spent his final years toiling on his opera, just rewritten it
a couple more times he might have come up with "Les
Miserables" and really made HD Pacific a bundle of money.
   Even so, "War and Peace" is pretty accessible, though a
sad Mr. Cerrone has not been able to talk music-video shows
into playing Natasha's Song between La Toya Jackson and the
Mass Murderers. No weird classical stuff] he keeps hearing
from his former colleagues. More promising is the prospect of
a deal with a recording company for cassettes, compact and
laser discs. HD Pacific is hoping "War and Peace" eventually
will recoup its investment, partly by vividly displaying HD's
possibilities to future software clients outside the opera
world.
   Mr. Jenkins, up to his ears in bills after the New York
City Opera dropped out as co-producer, could offer no
financial support. After Dr. Willcourt failed to extract a
few of our tax dollars from PBS, he dug into his own savings
for half the $750,000 budget. The rest came in donated
equipment and services, from companies such as Toshiba and
Ikegami; Northwest Mobile Television furloughed an
enthusiastic crew from the Goodwill Games. Ms. Zambello was
just then fixing a peculiarly angled shot of Napoleon on the
master tape.
   In the next few weeks, Dr. Willcourt and Mr. Cerrone are
trundling globally, booking "War and Peace" into movie
theaters. Maybe even in Moscow and Leningrad -- which
probably will be called St. Petersburg before the U.S. fully
awakens to the siren song of HDTV.

   By now, everyone in the U.S. seems to be aware of the
story of what New York City has become. A tourist from Utah
is stabbed on a subway platform, trying to defend his mother
from muggers. A young district attorney dies from a stray
bullet intended for someone else on the sidewalk. Children
get shot through steel-plated doors. Even street-smart New
Yorkers are astonished at the turmoil around them.
   Yet what New York has become is not impossible to
comprehend. We suggest that the key to understanding New
York's current distress won't be found in the usual treatises
on neglect, poverty and "resources." No, you can get a pretty
good idea of how New York got this way by looking at the
daily spectacle in front of a grocery store owned by Koreans
in Flatbush.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is a tableau of liberal politics gone utterly haywire.
Demonstrators led by self-anointed "black militants"
routinely hurl anti-Asian epithets toward the store and
distribute literature urging blacks not to buy from "people
who do not look like us." The leaflets don't just call for
the boycott of a particular Korean store that they have
charged with offending the black community. They tell blacks
they should "boycott all Korean stores." Passersby trying to
enter the stores are spat upon and threatened.
   From the outset it was clear that the anti-Korean actions,
the handiwork of a fringe element, embarrassed many blacks,
inspiring some to brave the gauntlet and buy groceries from
the Koreans. One black schoolteacher defiantly led his
high-school students into one of the boycotted stores to buy
their lunch -- to teach them, he said, what democracy was all
about. The most telling detail, however, is that the police,
under orders, refuse to enforce a court order keeping
marchers 50 feet away from the store entrance. The law, in
short, is negotiable.
   In lieu of enforcement, Mayor David Dinkins appointed an
"investigative panel" to look into the boycott of the Korean
stores. Its report, released in the middle of the recent
period of lawlessness, concluded that everyone involved is
guilty of something -- except the perpetrators of the
boycott. Repeating familiar litanies about the need for good
faith and negotiation, the mayor's panel, with a
head-in-the-sand evenhandedness, advises that "both sides of
the dispute" cease all inflammatory behavior.
   This affair, though not as nationally prominent as the
crime stories, has been an important test of David Dinkins's
view of himself as a conciliator. Clearly Mayor Dinkins is
not a demagogue but a man of good intentions. Indeed, in the
past we have voiced support for his qualities of calm; the
city was on edge before he entered office. Yet by empirical
test, the conciliation strategy exemplified in his handling
of the anti-Korean boycott is not working. As the rest of the
nation now knows, the city's sores are getting worse instead
of better. Perhaps a tough stand on principle would do
better. Most especially for the people who live in the most
crime-ridden neighborhoods; tourists need not worry about
spending any time in the places where small children are
being shot.
   Over a long period of years, urban liberals, black and
white, have tried to rationalize continuing urban
disintegration by resorting to a kind of sociologized
politics, with babble about "root causes," procedural
nitpicking in courtrooms, a juvenile justice system coddling
criminals-in-training, all set against the ritual invocation
of gun control as the patent medicine for all ills. Now, this
endlessly rationalized liberalism has been transformed into a
purely racial politics that attempts to legitimize fraudulent
political arguments and analogies, clearly evident in the
anti-Korean boycott. It shouldn't be too surprising that as
urban political leaders have persisted in peddling
doublethink and evasion, the main customers buying it are the
fringe fanatics and media-savvy hustlers.
   The broader public is not buying. Juries are convicting,
whether it is white men accused of murder in Bensonhurst or
black men accused of assaulting the Central Park jogger. News
accounts of the latter deliberations depicted minority jurors
bringing along white holdouts. News accounts of the subway
stabbing suggest friends and relatives of some of the accused
see them as punks.
   We think politicians incapable of absorbing elementary
truths clear to most ordinary citizens should start asking
themselves just whose interests they want to speak for -- the
political fringe or the people who elected them. Ultimately,
New York City's future, and that of other large U.S. cities,
turns crucially on the restoration of some respect for
civility and public order. While the legal system is far from
the whole of this, it is the starting point. Years of
paternalistic liberalism has turned the law into a system
laughed at by both criminals and citizens.
   Having given conciliation its due day, Mayor Dinkins may
now be the right man to lead the stand for principle. He
can't be expected to restore respect for the law overnight,
but he can point the direction. The place to start is obvious
-- enforcing orders courts have already issued to protect
Korean greengrocers.

   The Marxist Gardener's Favorite Flower

   My lily inventory gets done during high summer, an August
day with liliums nodding off all through the garden. (Not
counted are all the garden's misliliums: day lilies, calla
lilies, trout lilies, etc.) Despite a 10-year lily binge, and
the reliable summer reappearance of Enchantment, Imperial
Gold, Black Dragon, Pink Perfection and dozens of others --
I'm still short liliums. And so, each fall I order more,
thinking with thanks of Jan de Graaff (lily trademarked
JAGRA), the lily's 20th-century impresario.
   During the 40 years to 1970 that he was proprietor of the
Oregon Bulb Farms, Mr. de Graaff, who died last year at 86,
went about inventing the modern business of lilies, those
easygoing garden hybrids that Everygardener now grows as a
matter of course. By systematically building tough lilies --
indifferent to abuse and neglect, wonderfully showy but
virtually gardenerproof -- JAGRA made lilies ("the garden
Cinderellas" by his reckoning) that had hitherto owned the
rep of regally troublesome, demanding, finicky garden prima
donnas into horto-democratic garden regulars, no-nonsense
plants like daffodils and tulips, plants for hoi polloi.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. de Graaff's modern lily hybrids fall into the much
touted no-maintenance category, and gardeners need not be
much concerned with their cultivation. Rather, great care
should be taken with the initial purchase, siting and
planting. Once felicitously situated -- provided they were
plump, zaftig bulbs to begin with -- lilies can be ignored
for years.
   JAGRA once summed up the ease of lilies: "Lilies need no
pruning, no constant spraying, no pinching and disbudding, no
mulching or mounding to survive the winter." Nevertheless,
over the course of 40 years in the lily patch (his massive
breeding program involved lily tryouts by casts of tens of
thousands and Mr. de Graaff became the Cecil B. DeMille of
lilies), JAGRA dropped occasional declaratives re what lilies
do look like, since even regular garden plants respond better
to a little TLC. For those who would do well by the lilies of
their fields, herewith a culling of Jan de Graaff's Basic
Lily Observances:
   -- "The natural and preferable time for planting lily
bulbs is in the fall," Mr. de Graaff believed (in extremis;
earliest spring is just barely permissible); plant liliums in
a sunny, sloping spot (if possible) or in a raised bed.
   -- Except for the Madonna Lily (with its shallow
preference), plant the big bulbs fairly deep, covering with
4-6 inches soil.
   -- Sharp drainage sub-lily is an inviolable rule. Mr. de
Graaff once described a quick sonar soil-suitability test:
"If, when you plunge a spade into the soil, there is a faint
but quite audible grating sound, then, other things being
equal, lilies will like that soil."
   -- Open "air drainage" supra-lily is an absolute de
Graaffian requisite, "since stagnant air makes a breeding
place for fungus troubles."
   -- As to soil-type: neutral to slightly acid, friable,
fertile, humusy. At the most earthy level apply Mr. de
Graaff's Potato Rule: "Any soil that grows good potatoes
grows good lilies."
   -- Lime not lilies, as most are calcifuges -- serious lime
haters.
   -- Feed grossly these gross feeders: organic mulch,
compost, potash, phosphates, cottonseed meal, well-rotted cow
manure a la mulch, low-slow nitrogen.
   -- Deadhead but do not deadstem. Never, ever cut down a
lily stalk post-bloom. (IF compulsive garden tidiness is in
your character, don't grow lilies.) Await the natural
withering away of the leafstalk like a good Marxist gardener.
From the photosynthetic work of this year's leaves comes next
year's bloom and bust.
   -- Do not confuse your lilies] Mr. de Graaff's best
advice: "Leave lilies alone." He noted: "The true character
of the lily is that of a perennial plant which must be kept
moist and growing." He declared, "a healthy lily never
sleeps," and warned that a lily disturbed "may be thrown into
confusion."

   JOB OUTLOOK is weaker to static for college students this
semester.
   "It's more difficult for students to get positions now,"
says the University of Detroit, explaining, "There are fewer
jobs and more students wanting to fill them." But the
college's co-op education staff pressed a little harder this
year and managed to place 135 students, up from 120 the year
before. Michigan State sees plenty of fast-food and retail
jobs but says "the number of employers offering
career-related employment is more limited." Emory University
in Atlanta characterizes the job outlook as "fair to soft."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At Northwestern University, though, the student job market
looks "about the same as in the past." Students, it says, are
"blowing off" an abundant number of jobs paying $3.55 or
$3.65 an hour and searching for better-paying positions. The
University of Chicago assesses the job market as "good, about
the same." Georgia Tech views the outlook as positive.
   Duke see no evidence that a weaker economy is keeping
undergraduates from continuing their education.
                                                                                                       

   HOW MUCH? Survey finds wide range in local-government pay.
   Mayors Kathryn Whitmire of Houston, Coleman Young of
Detroit, David Dinkins of New York and Art Agnos of San
Francisco each earns close to $130,000 a year, says City &amp;
State, a biweekly newspaper that covers governmental
business. Yet Ms. Whitmire administers $758 million in
general-fund revenue, an amount that pales in comparison with
the billion-dollar-and-up budgets the other three supervise.
And all four earn less than the fire chief in Los Angeles,
who pulled in $153,656.
   Los Angeles offers the most generous scales, paying an
average $128,904 to the 10 executives examined by City &amp;
State. New York trailed with $105,000, followed by San
Francisco, with $100,290, and Detroit, with an average of
$90,289. But ranking fifth at $89,442 was San Jose, Calif.,
though its $255 million of revenue put it far down the budget
roster. Syracuse, N.Y., with the same revenue, pays its
executives $51,217.
                                                                                                       

   BILINGUAL AND MINORITY teachers are scarce for public
schools.
   One in five of the 25,000 students in Glendale, Calif.,
speaks Armenian and limited English. Yet the district has
only 30 teachers who speak Armenian, and efforts to hire more
-- even those without teacher licenses produce little
success. Westminster, Calif., looks for Vietnamese speakers.
Houston schools scamper to fill 400 bilingual and
special-education elementary slots. Observes an official in
Goose Creek, Texas: "We're all out there trying to hire the
very best."
   Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., started looking in February to
fill 15 openings but found only one minority teacher. "We had
a limited pool of minority candidates this year," it says.
Park Ridge, N.J., couldn't find a "fit." New York City hired
3,000 teachers, a third of them minorities. Still it couldn't
hire enough teachers who speak Haitian-Creole.
   Glen Cove, N.Y., worries about next year, when half of the
state's teachers will be eligible to retire.
                                                                                                       

   THINK SMALL. Companies with under $500 million in sales
allocate 1.4% of their stock and 5.7% of their profit to
executive incentive plans, double what bigger rivals spend,
consultant Towers Perrin says.
                                                                                                       

   THEY'RE HAPPY, they say. More than half the executives
interviewed by consultant Goodrich &amp; Sherwood Co. say they
are highly satisfied with the pay, recognition and security
they get from their jobs.
                                                                                                       

   BUT THEY'D LEAVE. One in three managers think most
executives would flee the corporate suite to start their own
businesses if they could get the necessary funding, a
separate survey by Accountemps finds.
                                                                                                       

   EGAD, JAMES BOND, the Society for Human Resource
Management is teaming up with SPECTR. No, not 007's old
nemesis without the final E. SPECTR is an acronym for a
Soviet human-resource group.
                                                                                                       

   APPTITUDE TESTS can predict job success, a 50-year
look-back shows.
   A study of the New York City Police Department's rookie
class of 1940 "confirms amply the predictive powers of
objective aptitude testing," asserts Harvard psychologist
R.J. Herrnstein. The class of 300 men and 18 women was
probably the department's brightest. The survey of 151 of 192
survivors finds 88 were college graduates, 28 had law
degrees, one was a doctor. It certainly was the department's
most successful, producing a commissioner, four chiefs and
the greatest number of officers above captain, with service
averaging 25 years.
   Says the psychologist in a report for the Citizens Crusade
Against Crime: "Neither background family status, nor the
individual's own educational history, was as predictive of
success as the score earned on a 3 1/2-hour test taken over
half a century ago." In April 1939, some 29,000 men took the
exam, which was not unlike a college-entrance test; the women
were chosen by different criteria. The highest 3,700 men took
a physical test that accounted for 30% of the final grade.
Job offers went to the top 350.
   Their rank, long service and lack of disciplinary problems
"confirm the selection procedure," the study says.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: The National Labor Relations Board rules the
American Federation of Musicians Local 6 can't picket the
leader of a one-man band whose only non-union employee is
himself. . . . Griping about American productivity? Two of
three executives in the U.S. and half in Britain believe
Britons work slower, Robert Half International says.

   Let George Do It

   The Iraq crisis is no mere sport, but to understand the
politics of this crisis a football metaphor helps. George
Bush has become the quarterback everyone expects to lead his
team to a final touchdown drive and victory. Meanwhile, all
of his teammates and fans claim to "support" the President,
but at just enough distance that they don't have to handle
the ball themselves, or take any blame if he falls short.
   Take Mikhail Gorbachev. The essential news from the
Helsinki summit is that the Soviets are fundamentally on
board with U.S. policy. They may not help the U.S. in a
shooting war, but they won't lift a finger for Saddam Hussein
either. This is the overriding strategic issue, and is what
gives George Bush the freedom of action in this case that no
U.S. President has had since the Soviets got the atomic bomb.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet Mr. Gorbachev isn't about to sign on without his own
caviling and advice. He'll "reduce" the number of Soviet
military advisers, but won't withdraw them straightaway --
perhaps because he doesn't want to seem to be merely
following Mr. Bush. He can't resist floating the utopian hope
for a Middle East peace conference -- an idea gently but
firmly rebuffed by Secretary of State Baker.
   Mr. Gorbachev even delivers a little lecture that "no
single country, however powerful," can lead the world
anymore. The Soviet leader still wants to talk as if he
commanded a superpower, even if it can no longer act like
one. Mr. Bush may feel that this is the price of the more
important strategic cooperation from the Soviets on Iraq, and
if that's true it's all right with us.
   Something similar seems evident among Mr. Bush's domestic
"supporters." It's true enough that outright opponents are
few -- for the moment. But everyone's carefully hedged.
George Will frets that by using the United Nations Mr. Bush
has committed the U.S. to the hoariest notions of
international law. Congresswomen Pat Schroeder rolls out her
gripe for all seasons: What about the allies? Senator Joe
Biden doesn't want to restore the emir of Kuwait, as if this
is the main issue. Even Alexander Haig and Henry Kissinger,
whom we earlier carelessly credited with urging a
"pre-emptive strike," have in fact not gone that far.
   In a letter today, Georgia Senator Sam Nunn objects to
being included in a Paul Gigot column describing
neo-isolationism among conservatives. In the interests of
accuracy, what Mr. Gigot wrote was that "Mr. Nunn has
typified conservatives who've worried, grumbled and caviled."
Readers of his letter can judge that for themselves.
   What is most revealing in all of this is the timidity
among Washington's elites to state publicly the reality of
this crisis. Either Saddam's aggression will succeed or it
will not. The dispatches from Middle East capitals report
that Arab leaders all say privately that Saddam has to be
taken out soon with a military strike. But in the current
American foreign affairs gestalt, it somehow has become taboo
for anyone to be seen in public urging military action.
   While all of these elites now claim to "support" George
Bush, do they really? They're now well positioned to jump on
board and be seen as backing any successful mission Mr. Bush
decides to launch. But if the going gets tough, they're also
positioned to get going. Either way, they'd all rather let
George do it.

   Baby Boomer Moves
   Reshape Metro Areas

<TEXT>
   DENVER and Washington have been strong "magnet" areas for
baby boomers.
   As part of a broad study of metropolitan America for the
Population Reference Bureau, University of Michigan
sociologist William Frey picked out those metropolitan areas
experiencing extra-large gains or losses in baby boom
population. He defines magnet areas as those with the highest
proportion of men and women ages 21 to 40 in their total 1985
population and at least a 9.5% increase in this age group
from 1980 to 1985, the latest year for which such detailed
figures are available.
   As of 1985, he calculates, almost one-third of
metropolitan Denver's population consisted of adult boomers,
and their number had grown more than 14% in the first half of
the 1980s.
   The Washington and Houston areas ranked just behind, with
adult boomers constituting 31% of their 1985 population.
Filling out the top 10 magnet list were the metropolitan
areas of Austin, Texas; Atlanta; San Francisco; Dallas;
Colorado Springs, Colo.; Portsmouth, N.H.; and Las Vegas,
Nev. Adult boomers accounted for anywhere from 27% to 30% of
their 1985 population. Of all the top 10 areas, Atlanta and
Dallas registered the biggest gains in boomers from 1980 to
1985, almost a 20% increase in each case.
   Mr. Frey notes that most magnet areas are important
service centers with good job opportunities and attractive
life styles. He concedes that both Denver and Houston may
have slipped in the ratings since 1985 because of
energy-industry problems, but doubts they have dropped from
the top 10 in percentage of boomers in their population.
   The 10 top boomer losers -- with the smallest proportion
of adult boomers in their total population and a boomer
exodus from 1980 to 1985 of at least 5% -- were old
industrial areas, such as Scranton-Wilkes Barre, Pa.;
Buffalo, N.Y.; Johnstown, Pa.; and Youngstown, Ohio. Adult
boomers accounted for only 21% to 23% of the population of
these 10 areas, and from 1980 to 1985, the number of boomers
in a few districts fell as much as 15%.
                                                                                                       

   Higher Outlays Backed
   For Kids' Health Care
                                                                                                       

   CHILD HEALTH emerges as a matter of increasing public
concern.
   A recent nationwide survey by the National Association of
Children's Hospitals finds three in five Americans believing
U.S. children today are worse off than five years ago; a
whopping 29% believes kids are "much worse" off. Asked
specifically whether the U.S. should spend more on children's
health care, 71% answer affirmatively while only 20% think
the country can't afford it. A surprising 59% say they would
favor a $100-a-year tax increase earmarked for better health
care for uninsured poor children.
   The poll found women more likely than men to say
children's situation has worsened, but the two genders
equally favor spending more on children's health. Even among
self-identified conservatives, three in five support greater
spending in this field.
   The association and other child advocacy groups are
launching an "I Care for Kids" campaign to make child health
care a bigger issue in coming elections.
                                                                                                       

   Racial Gap Shrinks
   On Premarital Sex
                                                                                                       

   PREMARITAL SEX becomes ever more common, according to a
1988 government survey of women 15 to 44.
   Nearly three-fourths, 72.4% to be exact, indicate they
began their sexual experience in nonmarital relations,
"continuing a long-term trend since at least the late 1950s,"
says William Pratt of the National Center for Health
Statistics. In the previous, 1982 survey, the figure was
64.7%.
   The recent rise has occurred mainly among white women. At
each age, higher proportions of black women report premarital
sex experience, but this has long been true. Now, says Mr.
Pratt, the black and white patterns are converging.
   Sixteen percent of the 1988 respondents say they were
married when having their first intercourse, while 12% hadn't
yet had sexual experience.
   Along with the rise in premarital sex, the survey shows
another drop in age at first intercourse -- two out of five
had begun sex before they were 18 -- and an increase in the
time between first intercourse and marriage. The almost
inevitable result is a rise in the number of women who have
had multiple partners and in the number of partners each has
had.
   Another survey, however, offers a different perspective.
Writing in Society magazine, Tom Smith and colleagues from
the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center
report that the vast majority of Americans are monogamous, in
the sense of having had only one sexual partner, married or
unmarried, during the preceding year. Only 18% of all
sexually active adults in a large 1988 sampling weren't
monogamous under this definition. Even among unmarried men
under 30, almost half specified only one sex partner during
the previous 12 months.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   OVER HALF of black children under 18 and nearly one-third
of Hispanic children live with only one parent, the Census
Bureau reports. This compares with 19% of white children. . .
. High school seniors who don't intend to go to college are
twice as likely to become smokers as those planning to go,
say Ingrid Waldron of the University of Pennsylvania and
Diane Lye of the University of Washington. They suggest that
for the non-college-bound, smoking may compensate for lack of
satisfaction in school status.

   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Tandem Computers Inc. said that its
growth rate might not meet Wall Street expectations, and that
it is implementing cost-cutting measures to preserve its
profit margins.
   Tandem, which makes computers with automatic backup
systems that are used by stock exchanges and banks, among
others, didn't elaborate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts had been projecting that for its fourth quarter
ending Sept. 30, Tandem would earn about $39 million to $44
million, or 35 to 40 cents a share, on revenue of about $510
million. J. Neil Weintraut, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist
Inc. in San Francisco, said he trimmed his estimate of
Tandem's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to 29 cents a share
on revenue of about $480 million. In the fiscal 1989 fourth
quarter, Tandem earned $39.4 million, or 38 cents a share, on
revenue of $456.2 million.
   In projecting the downturn, Tandem cited weakness in the
banking industry, a major source of its business. The company
said its revenue is being crimped by high interest rates in
international markets, such as Australia and Britain, as well
as general economic weakness in the U.S., particularly on the
East Coast.
   The announcement came after the market closed. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Tandem shares
closed at $13.625, up 12.5 cents.

   The bid would raise Hees's voting stake in the

emissions posed any health threat, the department said. Xerox
agreed to the fine without admitting any of the agency's

   Economy:
   Consumer Debt
   In July Expanded
   At Rate of 7.4%

   WASHINGTON -- Consumer debt grew in July at its fastest
rate in nine months, the Federal Reserve reported, but
analysts found signs in the data that Americans may be
feeling financially pinched.
   The amount of consumer credit outstanding in the U.S.
increased by $4.47 billion during the month, or at an annual
rate of 7.4%, the fastest pace of increase since October, the
Fed said. That followed a meager $116 million rise in June,
amounting to a 0.2% annual rate of expansion, and an increase
of $3.65 billion, or a 6.1% annual rate, in May.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of the July increase was in revolving credit, a
category that includes credit-card borrowing. Revolving
credit soared $3.77 billion in July, a 21.7% annual rate,
after expanding at rates of 7% in June and 18.8% in May.
   Analysts suggested that the figures might reflect more a
drop in repayments than a rise in borrowing.
   Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist at
DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington,
Mass., said given the slowdown in the economy, a likely
explanation for the big rise in revolving credit is that
"people are feeling the squeeze and not paying off as much of
their balance."
   At the same time, she said, "it looks as though people
have been trying to get their cars paid off," another common
occurrence during soft economic times.
   Automobile debt declined $534 million in July, or at a
2.2% annual rate, after falling $1.21 billion, or at a 7.3%
annual rate, in June.
   Mobile home loans edged up $33 billion, or at a 1.7%
annual rate, after dropping $83 billion, or a 4.3% annual
rate, in June.
   A miscellaneous category, which includes vacation loans,
tax loans, education loans and other personal loans, rose
$1.2 billion in July, or at a 7% annual rate, after growing
$753 million in June, a 4.4% annual rate.
   At the end of July, consumer installment debt totaled
$726.93 billion, up 4.1% from July 1989.

   Michael Milken's supporters, including numerous industry
leaders, flooded a federal judge with letters seeking
leniency for the former junk bond king, who is scheduled to
be sentenced Oct. 1.
   Some 170 friends, relatives, former clients and colleagues
urged Judge Kimba Wood to treat Mr. Milken gently when doling
out penalties for the six securities fraud-related felonies
to which he pleaded guilty in April. Mr. Milken could draw as
much as 28 years in prison.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Those who urged leniency include Steven J. Ross, chairman
and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner Inc.; Armand
Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.; Joseph Flom,
New York takeover lawyer; John Kluge, investor; Rosey Grier,
former football player, and Monty Hall, TV personality.
   Other writers included Roger Stone, chairman of Stone
Container Corp.; Peter Magowan, chairman of Safeway Stores
Inc., and Laurence Tisch, CBS Inc. chairman. Dozens of former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employees who were hired by Mr.
Milken asked the judge to spare him a prison term. Letters
were also mailed by Mr. Milken's cousins, aunts, uncles,
neighbors and the headmaster of his children's school.
   Letters of support are routine in sentencings, but the
outpouring for Mr. Milken was unusually strong. This resulted
in part from an effort by Mr. Milken's attorneys to solicit
such support, according to one letter writer. But an
individual familiar with the matter said many of the letters,
especially from "regular guys" who knew Mr. Milken, weren't
solicited.
   A sampling:
   Mr. Ross said that Mr. Milken "is no Ivan Boesky or Martin
Siegel," who have pleaded guilty to crimes tied to
insider-trading, and that his offenses "are not
characteristic of his values."
   Mr. Hammer said Mr. Milken "led the charge which helped to
assure that American democracy could thrive."
   Mr. Flom said Mr. Milken "demonstrated great acumen and
punctilious concern for what was ethical." He added that he
doesn't condone the acts to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty,
but that "I can only assume that they were the result of his
preoccupation with his clients' interests," causing him to
overlook some rules.
   Mr. Kluge, who made much of his wealth with Mr. Milken's
assistance, told Judge Wood that Mr. Milken's commitment to
social causes "is genuine," while Mr. Tisch said Mr. Milken's
offenses were "out of character."
   Mr. Hall, chairman of a children's charity to which Mr.
Milken has donated in recent years, said he has never met Mr.
Milken's equal.
   Daryl E. Gates, the chief of police in Los Angeles, said
he met Mr. Milken only once "a few years ago." But Mr. Gates
recalls liking Mr. Milken and proposes that Mr. Milken be
sentenced to develop a domestic Peace Corp to help reform
U.S. inner cities.
   There was a handful of unsolicited letters that weren't so
favorable. Disque Deane, former chairman of Corporate
Property Investors, wrote that he was "shocked and surprised
at the leniency" of Mr. Milken's settlement and that Mr.
Milken shouldn't be sentenced to a "country club" type
prison. John R. Weigel, a Costa Mesa, Calif., analyst, wrote:
"Give the felon the maximum penalty allowable."

   Baxter International Inc. said it cut its stake in
Genetics Institute Inc. to 3.5% from 7% of the common shares
outstanding.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Baxter said it sold 521,374 shares Friday at $31.25 a share.
As a result, Baxter, a medical products and services concern
based in Deerfield, Ill., now holds 500,000 shares in
Genetics Institute, a pharmaceuticals company in Cambridge,
Mass.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As previously reported, Baxter has said that it intends to
sell all or part of its investment in Genetics Institute and
that the proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt.
   In making the announcement last month, Baxter said the
company has an "excellent working relationship" with Genetics
Institute. The two companies are involved in a joint effort
to develop and market a genetically engineered drug on which
Genetics Institute holds a patent. The drug is for
hemophilia, a hereditary condition in which one of the normal
blood-clotting factors is absent.

   NEW YORK -- Seagram Co. said its board authorized the
purchase of as much as 5%, or 4.7 million, of the Montreal
distiller's common shares on the open market at various times
for the fiscal year starting Sept. 25.
   At yesterday's closing price of $75 a share, up 12.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
stock repurchase's indicated value is about $352.5 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Seagram, which has 94.1 million shares outstanding, can
buy the stock on the Montreal, Toronto and New York stock
exchanges.
   This is the fifth consecutive year Seagram's board has
authorized a share buy-back, a spokesman said. He added that
Seagram's stock "remains a desirable investment" and that the
repurchase "undoubtedly . . . would help support" the share
price.
   Under Seagram's most recent buy-back, which expires Sept.
24, the company bought a total of about 2.1 million common
shares for an average $78.04 apiece, as of Aug. 31. That plan
also allowed for a total purchase of 5% of the company's
common outstanding.
   Seagram recently reported a 3% increase in net income for
its second quarter, ended July 31, to $205 million, or $2.18
a share.

   Peugeot S.A. Chairman Jacques Calvet said the French auto

for this year at the 1989 level of 10.3 billion francs ($1.96
billion).
   Mr. Calvet told reporters that Peugeot's consolidated
revenue is expected to rise at a slightly faster rate than
the 5.8% increase registered for the first half.
</LP>

   He said that the European market for cars next year is
likely to contract 3% from this year, and that car sales this
year could ease to about 13.3 million vehicles from 13.4
million in 1989. He said the oil price increase resulting
from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait means that Peugeot will
have to work harder to achieve its earnings goal.
   Mr. Calvet said that it is too early to identify the final
effect of the Persian Gulf crisis on the French market, but
that demand this year will be boosted by tax cuts planned by
France, which is expected to announce this week that it will
reduce the top level of the value-added tax by three
percentage points to 22%.

   Move Into U.S. Is Part
   Of Sector's Bid to Diversify

   TOKYO -- Nippon Steel Corp., the largest steelmaker in the
developed world, will begin making and selling notebook-sized
computers in the U.S. in November.
   The machine, which will be compatible with the IBM-AT
personal computer standard, is the latest example of the
Japanese steel industry's dash to diversify into everything
from semiconductors to theme parks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Three to four years ago, the steel industry was in a very
depressed time," Kiyofumi Suzuki, general manager of Nippon
Steel's electronics and information-systems division, said at
a news conference Monday. "Our executives decided to get into
electronics and other areas not related to steel."
   Unlike fledgling computer industry entrants from Taiwan
and South Korea, Nippon Steel says it won't make low-priced,
imitative knock-offs, but instead wants to cultivate a
leading-edge image. "Our target is to be the No. 1 or No. 2
brand {in quality} in the U.S. within three or four years,"
Mr. Suzuki said. "We will reduce our volume until we can get
support for consumers and distributors."
   The company said its Librex machine will be the first in
its segment with an Intel Corp. 80386sx processor, and that
it is slightly smaller and lighter, weighing about six
pounds, than competing models.
   The price, $4,500 for the 386 model and $3,500 for a
version with the slower 80286 Intel processor, is roughly the
same as other notebook-size computers currently on sale in
the U.S.
   Nippon Steel says it won't even consider selling in Japan
until after it has proven itself in the U.S. The Japanese
personal-computer market is less developed, is dominated by
the relatively proprietary NEC Corp. standard, and "is not
open compared to the U.S.," even for Japanese newcomers, Mr.
Suzuki said. The company will begin exploring the European
market later this year.
   Although it doesn't make any of the major parts, Nippon
Steel says it engineered the machine itself, drawing on its
years as a major user of computers and computer systems. "The
steel companies have acquired their own expertise in
electronics because of processing innovations," said Mineko
Sasaki-Smith, head of research at Credit Suisse's Tokyo
office. "In developing their own software," she added, "they
have acquired expertise and programs. It was a natural
outcome."
   In recent years, Nippon Steel has established a joint
venture with Concurrent Computer Corp. to make super
minicomputers, and signed an agreement to sell Sun
Microsystems Inc. workstations in Japan. Two years ago, the
company set up four software development and service
joint-ventures.
   Nippon Steel executives hope to push the company's
dependence on steel down to 60% of revenues by 1995 from 80%
today. They also want to derive one-fifth of their business
from the electronics and information-systems group, which
provides about 5% today.
   Nippon Steel isn't alone in its move to diversify. Kobe
Steel and Kawasaki Steel have semiconductor joint ventures
with American partners. And all the major steel companies are
exploring unconventional uses of their excess land, such as
pig farming and flower growing. Nippon Steel opened a theme
park in southern Japan earlier this year.
   Their rationale: Despite a surprising revival in steel
sales recently, industry demand is expected to drop about 10%
over the next five years, particularly as users seek lighter
new materials.
   Analysts say it's too early to tell, however, how
successful such diversifications will prove, and many express
skepticism. "I think it's pretty unlikely the steel companies
are going to be able to carve a niche in PCs," said Michael
Jeremy of Baring Securites' Tokyo office. "For Japanese
computer makers it's an extremely competitive area. What
advantage do the steel companies have?"
   Nippon Steel, however, has fairly ambitious plans. It
hopes to sell 30,000 notebook computers next year and 50,000
annually within three to five years. By comparison, NEC,
which has more computer experience, expects to sell 20,000
notebooks for 1989 and 1990 combined.
   Mr. Suzuki said Nippon Steel hasn't finalized any
distribution agreements. The notebook-sized computers will be
assembled by Solectron Corp. of San Jose, Calif. Librex
Computer Systems Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon
Steel's U.S. unit, is also based in San Jose.

   Thomas &amp; Betts Corp., a Bridgewater, N.J., maker of
electrical and electronic connectors, parts and systems, said
it plans to take a third-quarter charge equal to 43 cents a
share, and to cut 5%, or about 250, of its workers.
   The moves, stemming from a consolidation of manufacturing
operations and cuts in operating costs, should save the
company about $10 million a year, a spokesman said. The
planned charge is about $13 million before taxes but will be
partly offset by a pretax gain of $4 million from the
disposal of real estate and certain other assets. In the 1989
third quarter, Thomas &amp; Betts earned $12.1 million, or 71
cents a share, on revenue of $131.3 million.

   Healthco International Inc. said it filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Delaware alleging Gemini Partners L.P.
violated proxy rules in connection with the limited
partnership's consent solicitation to remove Healthco's
board.
   Healthco, a Boston-based dental equipment company, also
said that based on a review of the consents Gemini delivered
to Healthco last week, that Gemini hasn't obtained consents
representing a majority of Healthco's common outstanding.
Last week Gemini, based in New York, said it had received a
majority of consents executed by Healthco shareholders. If
certified, the consents would trigger the removal of the
incumbent Healthco board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Healthco's lawsuit seeks to have written consents executed
in favor of Gemini's nominees declared invalid and seeks an
injunction against Gemini's consent solicitation.
   Healthco alleges that Gemini violated laws by soliciting
and obtaining written consents prior to dissemination of
materials concerning Healthco's proposed merger with Hicks,
Muse &amp; Co. It also alleges that Gemini is unlawfully
asserting the validity of written consents obtained before
shareholders knew about the proposed merger, in which Hicks
Muse will buy Healthco for $19.25 a share, or about $250
million.
   Last week, Gemini filed suit against Healthco in Delaware
Chancery Court seeking a judgment declaring that Healthco's
current board has been lawfully removed by shareholders and
replaced by Gemini's seven-member slate.

sterling-denominated convertible bonds, also unsecured and
subordinated to all other creditors of the company.

Corp. would have to redeem before paying dividends on any
other shares and within a set time period.
   Shares also could be preferred convertible shares that

company were liquidated and be convertible into ordinary
shares if the firm recovers. Separately, holders of the

assets until Sept. 27.
   Separately, Airship Industries Ltd., a British designer,

   Granges Inc. said it agreed to pay 5.5 million Canadian
dollars (US$4.7 million) to two Toronto companies to settle a
lawsuit filed against Granges by Abermin Corp. in 1988.
   Under terms of the agreement with CSA Management Ltd. and
Goldcorp Investment Ltd., all related claims have been
dropped, Granges said. The two companies, as Abermin's major
creditors, became party to the suit when Abermin went
bankrupt in March.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its suit, Abermin sought to rescind a joint venture
with Granges under which they developed the Tartan Lake gold
mine in Manitoba. Abermin alleged that the mine's reserves
were lower than first forecast, and that costs exceeded
projections.
   Granges initially forecast output of 50,000 ounces of gold
annually at the mine, but later reduced its forecast to
20,000 ounces. Production, which began in 1987, was suspended
last fall.
   Under the accord, Granges said it will acquire Abermin's
partnership interest in the mine, plus related mineral claims
and assets. It said funds to cover the settlement will be
drawn from C$20.5 million of funds previously set aside.
   Granges, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, is
32.3%-owned by Australia's M.I.M. Holdings Ltd., a large
mining concern.

   Consideration of Luxury Tax
   Is Touching Off an Old Debate

   WASHINGTON -- As if Donald Trump didn't already have
enough to worry about, the luxury tax may be making a
comeback.
   Democrats' insistence on skewing any tax increase so that
it hits the rich and Republicans' resistance to raising
income-tax rates have revived consideration of the luxury
levy, which was imposed by the federal government during
World War II and not abandoned until 1965.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Industries that make and sell goods the budget negotiators
consider luxuries are dusting off old arguments and coming up
with new ones in an effort to head off any new tax on their
wares.
   "The arbitrary selection of certain commodities as
luxuries is going to distort the economy," complains Matthew
Runci, executive director of the Manufacturing Jewelers and
Silversmiths of America.
   The pleasure boat industry says any new taxes would weaken
an already depressed industry and reduce demand for yachts so
much the government wouldn't make any money taxing them. And
the Electronics Industries Association says consumer
electronics aren't a luxury. "Our products are ubiquitous,"
says Gary Shapiro, vice president for consumer electronics.
   As previously reported, Democrats have proposed a 10% tax
that would apply to a retail purchase price in excess of $500
for furs, $1,000 for electronics, $5,000 for jewelry, $25,000
for autos, $50,000 for boats and yachts, and the entire
purchase price of private aircraft, according to a written
summary of their opening proposal at the budget talks under
way at Andrews Air Force Base.
   Under this proposal, for instance, the purchaser of a
$50,000 Porsche would have to pay $2,500 in federal luxury
taxes -- 10% of the price over $25,000 -- on top of any local
sales taxes.
   Republican aides say their side has contemplated a 5% levy
that would apply to the part of a car's price that exceeded
$30,000, as well as to other items, but they apparently
haven't put their proposal on the table.
   Thresholds at these levels would, in most cases, limit the
tax to a small fraction of all purchases. The jewelry makers,
for instance, were relieved; they had anticipated any luxury
tax would apply to items that cost far less than $5,000, and
there are indications that Republicans have considered just
such a plan.
   The vast majority of cars purchased by Americans would be
spared the tax. Only between 5% and 7% of all cars cost more
than $25,000, says Bernard Campbell of DRI/McGraw Hill, a
Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. The average car costs less
than $16,000, he says.
   But that isn't much consolation to auto dealers. "When you
start talking about that price range -- $25,000 -- it would
definitely have an impact in a market that's already in
turmoil," says Bill Fitzpatrick, general sales manager of
Metropolitan Motorcars of Marlow Heights, Md., which sells
Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Audi, Saab and Subaru autos. Dealers,
he says, would be forced to absorb at least some of the tax
with discounts or bigger trade-in allowances.
   Plans to revive the luxury tax were examined by the
Treasury during the Reagan years but never were proposed.
Defining just what is a luxury and what is not is always
tricky and controversial.
   And enforcing the tax can be a problem. The Democrats'
plan to tax consumer electronic products that cost more than
$1,000 could, for instance, encourage dealers to break
products into components that cost less than $1,000. It
wasn't immediately clear if the Democrats' plan covers
personal computers. Most of them sell for more than $1,000
but could easily be separated into parts that might sell for
less.
   The Joint Tax Committee of Congress estimates that the
Democrats' version of a luxury tax, if effective Jan. 1,
1991, would raise $600 million in fiscal 1991, which begins
Oct. 1., and $8.1 billion over five years.
   The luxury tax is part of a package of Democratic-backed
tax increases aimed at upper-income Americans that would
raise $14.4 billion in fiscal 1991.

   Freight Shippers Find Military Buildup
   In Mideast Helps to Offset Soft Demand
   ----

   The huge amount of U.S. military supplies being sent to
the Mideast has caused some disruptions in commercial freight
shipments, but shippers doubt it will absorb overcapacity in
the industry.
   Nevertheless, with the U.S. military chartering commerical
vessels and booking space on ships in regular commerce, ship
company executives say the Mideast buildup offers some
opportunities to offset slowing demand from civilian
shippers. "It could be a shot in the arm for the shipping
industry," said Jack Helton, a vice president of Sea-Land
Service Inc., the ocean shipping unit of Richmond, Va.-based
CSX Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far, the U.S. government has chartered 41 commercial
vessels, some at double the usual charter rates, to carry
equipment to the Mideast. In addition, the federal government
plans to ship more than 1,000 containers a week on commercial
vessels to resupply U.S. troops.
   Thomas D. Lewellen, corporate traffic supervisor of
Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, Ill., blames the Mideast buildup
for delaying a shipment of the company's tractors and heavy
machinery at Charleston, S.C., for a week, earlier this
month. The equipment had been scheduled to sail aboard the
American Falcon to Europe, but the freighter was abruptly
chartered by the military for Mideast service. "It's very
disruptive doing business with offshore customers," said Mr.
Lewellen, who rerouted the cargo to another freighter.
   Other shippers play down the effects of the military
buildup, which coincides with a glut of ship capacity. The
day the American Falcon was removed from commercial service,
"every ship carrier in the book called us to say everyone
should expect a price increase," said William McNellis,
director of transportation/logistics at J.I. Case Co., a unit
of Tenneco Inc. "They were trying to make a non-event a major
event to hopefully get shippers to agree to pay higher
rates."
   Ship companies aren't sure whether to expect a windfall or
a headache from increased military cargo. "If the buildup
were to end in a very short time it would be a headache,"
said Mr. Helton, the Sea-Land vice president. "If the supply
line is in place for six months we would expect to come out
whole."
   Mr. Helton said Sea-Land has had to charter additional
vessels and containers for a period greater than six months
to haul food, clothing and other supplies to U.S. troops in
the Mideast. If the supply line is ended before that time,
Sea-Land would be stuck with extra capacity and costs, he
said.
   Sea-Land, the largest U.S.-flag container ship company, is
starting two new weekly ship services to expedite military
shipments to the Persian Gulf from ports in Europe and Asia.
The ships connect with Sea-Land's regularly scheduled vessels
from the U.S. By skipping some intermediate ports, Sea-Land
expects to shave the transit time for military cargo to the
Mideast from the U.S. East Coast to 23 days from the usual 33
days, Mr. Helton said.
   Some ship companies are receiving premium rates when they
charter their vessels to the military. For example, Lykes
Bros. Steamship Co. has chartered one freighter at $34,000 a
day, about twice the usual charter rate, some shippers said.
Lykes officials say the charter rate attempts to compensate
Lykes for taking the ship from commercial service. Eugene
McCormick, president and chief operating officer of closely
held, New Orleans-based Lykes, said that "when you bump a
commercial customer, he has to find an alternative carrier.
When you want to go back to that customer, he says, `where
were you when I needed you -- forget it.'"
   The most immediate effects of the Mideast buildup were on
the air cargo industry, which was pressed into service early
to fly supplies to Saudi Arabia. One result: Northwest
Airlines has canceled five of the 20 weekly freighters from
Japan to the U.S., causing delays for about 450 tons of
freight a week. About 5% to 10% of the shipments are delayed
for a day, said Seiji Saito, Northwest's manager of cargo
sales for eastern Japan.
   Mr. Saito says he hasn't received complaints from
customers so far. But the delays may become a bigger issue as
air shipments enter a peak season from September to the end
of November, he said. "We're short of capacity, as it is," he
said.
   Geoffrey Tudor, a spokesman for Japan Air Lines, said that
the company has offered to supply up to four flights a week
for shipments to the Middle East. That may lead to a
reduction in the company's regular freighter service, he
said.
   One U.S. Navy officer being transferred to Japan has
already felt the effects of the Mideast crisis on freight
transportation. The officer's household goods were supposed
to come to Japan aboard a U.S. Air Force plane. Instead,
without warning, the plane was commandeered for use in the
Persian Gulf and the officer's goods were loaded on a slow
boat across the Pacific.
   Transport industry officials in London said they haven't
experienced capacity strains as a result of increased
military shipments to the Persian Gulf.
   "There doesn't seem to be any difficulty," said an
official with the Baltic Exchange, a London-based
international shipping market. "In fact, it would be
appreciated if it had. The market seems to be fairly quiet.
{The military buildup} hasn't moved rates."
   An official from London-based LEP Group noted the excess
of merchant shipping capacity. "There's no freight moving to
Kuwait, which was an active trader, and there's been a
downturn in trade in the Gulf area," as companies steer away
from trade in the region, he said. The official added that
merchant vessels doing business in the Mideast have imposed
surcharges in recent weeks, but he said the higher rates
reflect increased fuel and insurance costs, not strained
capacity.

   TINTON FALLS, N.J. -- Denis R. Brown, a specialist in
corporate turnarounds, was named president, chief executive
officer and vice chairman of Concurrent Computer Corp. as the
company undergoes a restructuring effort.
   Concurrent also named a director, Dean W. Freed, chairman.
Mr. Freed, 67 years old, had been chairman and chief
executive of EG&amp;G Inc., a provider of scientific products and
services in Wellesley, Mass.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Brown, 51, succeeds James K. Sims, 44, who resigned
his three posts in the wake of the company's report Friday of
a net loss of $38 million, or $2.05 a share, for the fourth
quarter ended June 30. The results include a $24.2 million
restructuring provision.
   Mr. Brown said he will be "taking a good hard look" at
Concurrent's three segments, which supply computer systems to
commercial, technical and government clients. He formerly was
president and chief executive of Penn Central Industries
Group, a subsidiary of Penn Central Corp., Cincinnati.
   Mr. Sims, who presided at Concurrent from its inception in
1985 to its merger in 1988 with Massachusetts Computer Corp.,
had weathered a series of revenue losses in recent years.
Industry downturns and economic uncertainties resulted in a
previously announced near-20% reduction in the company's
world-wide workforce and several plant shutdowns.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday,
Concurrent's common stock closed at 75 cents a share, down
12.5 cents.

   Corporate Data Sciences Inc. said its board declared
effective a spinoff to shareholders of Aril Group Inc. The
transaction is part of a restructuring of Corporate Data into
two separately traded companies.
   Corporate Data said its 22,119,256 Aril shares will be
distributed pro rata to Corporate Data shareholders of record
on Jan. 22, 1990, on the basis of 1.63 shares of Aril for
each Corporate Data share held. Corporate Data said its agent
would begin notifying shareholders immediately to make the
distribution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Corporate Data said it plans to continue its restructuring
through a merger with the company's 90%-owned subsidiary,
Consolidated Packaging Corp. After the merger, Corporate Data
said its shares will become shares of Consolidated Packaging,
a paper concern. Aril is a New York-based holding company
with kitchen-cabinet operations.
   The spinoff, originally set for January, was delayed
because of Securities and Exchange Commission "paper work"
and Aril's purchase from Corporate Data of the
kitchen-cabinet operations, Corporate Data said. In exchange
for those operations, Corporate Data received Aril shares
that boosted to 72% Corporate Data's stake in Aril.

   PRINCETON, N.J. -- UJB Financial Corp. agreed to sell its
consumer credit card portfolio for more than $250 million to
the Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank subsidiary of Bank of
Montreal.
   The commercial banking concern said it will post a
third-quarter gain of $50 million on the sale, which is the
premium Harris Trust agreed to pay above the value of the
portfolio. For 1989's third quarter, UJB reported earnings of
$31.4 million, or 69 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   UJB said, however, that continuing softness in its service
area's economy is forcing it to increase its provisions for
possible bad loans. Such provisions plus expenses from the
sale will wipe out much of the $50 million gain, it said.
   UJB Chairman T. Joseph Semord cited fierce competition in
the credit card market and the slowing of the economy as the
main reasons for exiting the card-issuing business. UJB,
which expects to close the transaction this month, will
invest proceeds from the sale into other product lines, Mr.
Semord said.
   UJB has $13.3 billion in assets and provides financial
services through 270 offices in New Jersey and eastern
Pennsylvania. Bank of Montreal has about $70 billion in
assets.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
UJB shares rose 12.5 cents to $12.25.

   Seidman Urges Reassessment Of Policy
   Of Closing Sick but Functioning Thrifts

   WASHINGTON -- The government strategy guiding the
savings-and-loan cleanup may have outlived its usefulness,
according to the chairman of the federal bailout agency.
   Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, William
Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., expressed
some doubt about whether it is prudent to maintain the policy
of automatically seizing sick S&amp;Ls. "Closing an institution
rapidly does not necessarily mean that we'll end up without
loss," Mr. Seidman said. "If the institution is not being
badly managed, we simply transfer bad assets from the
institution to the government."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government already has seized most of the biggest and
most insolvent thrifts, leaving the RTC bloated with billions
of dollars in assets. The assets remain a taxpayer burden
until the agency finds buyers -- a process that is expected
to take years. The RTC now must evaluate whether this
tourniquet approach makes sense for thrifts not bleeding red
ink so profusely.
   But by allowing undercapitalized S&amp;Ls to remain open, the
regulators risk repeating mistakes of the 1980s, when
regulators allowed ailing thrifts to continue operating in
the hope that the economy would improve. The strategy, called
"forbearance," simply gave the thrifts more time to pile up
losses.
   "With the history during the 1980s, any notion of
forbearance tends to be automatically seen as unattractive
and not facing up to problems," Sen. Donald Riegle, chairman
of the committee warned. But the Michigan Democrat urged the
regulators to reverse course if new tactics can save money in
the long run.
   Many industry experts have complained that the RTC has
taken an unyielding approach toward undercapitalized thrifts,
whose management and portfolios may differ radically. "The
RTC is already choking on everything it has," said Randy
German, a thrift accounting expert for Grant Thornton, a New
York-based accounting firm. "They are going to have to come
up with other ideas." He said the regulators should delay
seizing sick thrifts, while monitoring their operations.
   With the bailout fund expected to run out of cash by the
end of the year, a strategy of easing up on undercapitalized
thrifts would allow cleanup officials to conserve cash in the
short term. And even after Congress sets aside new funds for
the cleanup, soft real-estate markets are going to push the
S&amp;L cleanup costs still higher, Mr. Seidman said. "Every time
we estimate losses now, we're looking at lower real-estate
markets, which means the losses are higher," he added.
   Also at the hearing, the banking regulators agreed to
resolve within 30 days a dispute over the amount of capital
that banks must hold in reserve. New regulations require
banks and thrifts to reserve capital based upon the amount of
risk in their lending. Mr. Seidman, also chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said that the FDIC agrees
with rules proposed by the Federal Reserve governing minimum
capital standards. The two agencies are discussing
differences in the capital rule language with the comptroller
of the currency.

   Heard on the Street:
   Short Sellers Betting Heavily That Sara Lee,
   Down 20% This Year, Will Keep on Falling

   Somebody doesn't like Sara Lee.
   Even though the Deerfield, Ill., marketer of food products
and clothing has posted 13 years of record earnings, its
stock has declined 20% this year, closing at 26 3/4 yesterday
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. In the past two
months, short sellers have been placing big bets that the
stock will continue to decline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Short sellers borrow stock and immediately sell it, hoping
the price will drop. Eventually they must buy shares to
replace the ones they borrowed. But if the price drops enough
in the meantime, they profit. Short interest -- the number of
shares borrowed and not yet replaced -- in Sara Lee stock
ballooned to 3.9 million shares as of mid-August, the latest
tally available from the New York Stock Exchange.
   Sara Lee is hardly the sort of stock short sellers
normally swarm around. Shorts generally look for troubled
companies with painfully heavy debt loads. But Sara Lee has
been consistently profitable, with earnings growing about 14%
a year. Its debt load is higher than some people prefer, with
debt at about 36% of capital, but isn't far out of line with
that of competitors.
   Nevertheless, three highly regarded money management firms
-- Steinhardt Partners, Tiger Management, and Soros Fund
Management -- are shorting the stock heavily, according to
some money managers and analysts. The three firms won't
confirm or deny the reports.
   Sara Lee's chief financial officer, Michael Murphy, says
he has heard that the short sellers' main concern is Sara
Lee's T-shirt business, part of its Hanes clothing unit.
T-shirt sales are growing, but capacity to produce T-shirts
has grown faster. An inventory glut looms and will take at
least two more quarters to work off, Mr. Murphy says.
   But Mr. Murphy says he is "puzzled" by the large-scale
short selling because T-shirts are only a small part of Sara
Lee's sales. How small? One analyst says 2%. Mr. Murphy won't
disclose a figure, but says it's "a little bit more than
that."
   People familiar with the shorts' thinking say their
concerns go well beyond T-shirts. Sara Lee "has been one of
the faster growing food companies, but in the past 12 months
it has disappointed, slowed down," says Kurt Feuerman, a
Morgan Stanley analyst. "It's not going to be that easy for
them to ramp up the growth rate again." Mr. Feuerman himself
rates the stock a "hold."
   Operating earnings in bakery goods and packaged meats fell
16% in the fiscal year that ended in June. Bakery business
was hurt by the trend to lower-calorie products, which Sara
Lee is belatedly joining. Meats were hurt by rising hog
prices, a factor that has since reversed. The company says
both businesses will do better this year.
   Sara Lee's earnings now come mainly from clothing, rather
than food. Wall Street usually values food stocks more
highly, on the theory that food earnings are more dependable.
   That's a "gross mistake," claims Sara Lee's chief
executive, John H. Bryan Jr. At a meeting Friday with
analysts and money managers in New York, he said that Sara
Lee's biggest apparel business, hosiery (L'Eggs and Hanes
brands), is steady and has outstanding profit margins, making
it in many ways a better business than food, where
competition is fierce.
   Short sellers also point to what they say is a weak
pricing environment for underwear in general, not just
T-shirts. Sara Lee's Mr. Murphy says pricing lately is
"nothing out of the ordinary." He acknowledges that Hanes has
cut underwear prices three times, but says that the most
recent cut was some time ago.
   One short seller claims that hosiery shipments lately have
been disappointing. The company, though it readily admits to
problems in T-shirts, won't stand for that kind of talk. Sara
Lee's hosiery business "is wonderful," Mr. Murphy says.
   Mr. Bryan concedes that the U.S. hosiery industry "has
been in decline for several years," partly because of a trend
to more casual clothes. But he says Sara Lee can thrive in
the business nevertheless, by continuing to gain market share
(now about 43% in the U.S.). His target: a 60% U.S. share,
and similar dominance in Europe, where the hosiery business
is extremely fragmented.
   Finally, some pessimists cite a report by Kellogg
Associates, a Los Angeles research firm, pointing to what
Kellogg sees as classic warning signs in Sara Lee's financial
statements -- a buildup of inventories and accounts
receivable, or money owed to the company. Sara Lee officials
say those figures are explainable by such things as a
changing business mix and the fact that "retailers are in
tough shape."

   The Roots of Innovation
   ----
   By Alan Reynolds

<LP>
   In the grand tradition of Harvard Business School
professors, Michael Porter requires an extraordinarily hefty
book to expand upon the following hypothesis: Active
competition for demanding customers in the home market keeps
companies under pressure to constantly innovate and upgrade.
Such Darwinian rivalry at home eventually produces a
competitive industry in world trade.
   This innocuous idea, imbedded in "The Competitive
Advantage of Nations" (Free Press, 855 pages, $35), has been
surprisingly controversial, greeted as either heresy or
revelation. Economists, for instance, seem annoyed with Mr.
Porter because he emphasizes case studies of particular
industries, such as the motion-picture industry in the U.S.
or printing presses in Germany. Further, he dismisses such
cherished "macroeconomic" statistics as budget deficits and
exchange rates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Nations have enjoyed rapidly rising living standards," he
notes, "despite budget deficits {Japan, Italy, Korea},
appreciating currencies {Germany and Switzerland}, and high
interest rates {Italy and Korea}."
   A further source of irritation may be the way in which
this book immediately surrenders its title: "We must abandon
the whole notion of a `competitive nation' . . . The only
meaningful concept of competitiveness at the national level
is national productivity."
   In fact, the concept of productivity has its limitations.
For example, output per worker might be increased,
Europeanstyle, by leaving all but the most productive workers
unemployed-through high minimum wages or formidable
restrictions on layoffs. But Mr. Porter doesn't really stick
to his own productivity standard for measuring national
success. Instead, he simply dismisses the recent doubling of
productivity growth in manufacturing in the U.S., from the
1970s to the 1980s.
   This is "not yet a sign of fundamental change," he argues,
quickly switching to other measures of success, looking at
shares of world exports, or "outbound" foreign investment --
investment in other countries.
   "Inbound foreign investment," he claims, "is never the
solution to a nation's competitive problems." Why not? Are we
really to believe that the U.S. doesn't make better cars
today as a result of the many Japanese factories on U.S.
soil? Would Canada really be as affluent as it is without all
the U.S. producers located there?
   When criticizing the U.S., Mr. Porter wants to have it
both ways. If foreign companies invest in the U.S., he argues
that this means American firms are missing opportunities to
upgrade technology. If U.S. firms invest abroad, on the other
hand, Mr. Porter argues that this means American companies
(unlike foreign companies in the U.S.) do not know how to
produce efficiently in their own country.
   Indeed, Mr. Porter's narrow concept of what constitutes a
"domestic" industry is archaic and provincial in a world of
transnational companies. His applause for the revival of the
Swiss watch industry, for example, neglects the fact that
several of the most famous Swiss brands are now owned by a
U.S. entrepreneur, North American Watch. Is a Chrysler with a
Mitsubishi engine really more "American" than a Ford Probe
LX, which is built in Michigan with a U.S. engine?
   Aside from "outbound" foreign investment, the author's
only other measure of competitive advantage -- shares of
"world exports" -- is equally slanted against the U.S. World
exports have been heavily dominated by expanding exports to
the U.S., which is one race that U.S. firms can't even enter.
How could the U.S. be expected to export itself?
   Mr. Porter draws pictures to illustrate his theory, with
four national attributes forming a "diamond" of competitive
advantage -- rivalry, demand conditions, factor conditions
and "clusters" of supporting industries. This is just a
pedagogic device for expanding a simple idea into hundreds of
pages, dividing it into four parts and four related "stages"
of development.
   Under the category of "demand conditions," for example,
Mr. Porter asserts, without evidence, that American consumers
and retailers are no longer very "sophisticated." Yet this is
contradicted by his own chapter on services, which shows the
U.S. in the "leading position" in retailing.
   Mr. Porter asserts that "high {educational} standards and
"a federal role in education" are "vital." Yet many
educational specialists are arguing for more diversity,
competition and choice in schooling. Since competition is the
driving force behind constant improvement in industry, why
should it not have the same effect in education?
   The book's basic theme, that competition fosters
innovation, serves as a welcome antitoxin to the revival of
corporatist "social engineering" ideas that instead depict
competition as wasteful and cartels ("strategic alliances")
as innovative. It also serves to warn developing countries
not to penalize important domestic markets in favor of export
promotion. The case studies on how specific industries
prospered in various countries undoubtedly contain many
insights of value to business strategists.
   Yet the title misleads. There is very little substance
here on the ways in which national policies, including tax,
trade and monetary policies, create more or less favorable
conditions for individuals and enterprises to generate
wealth.

   Continental Airlines Holdings and Electronic Data Systems
Corp. said they signed agreements on their previously
announced computer reservation system partnership.
   The partnership, announced in February, involves the sale
by System One -- Continental Airlines Holdings' reservation
system -- of its telecommunications and airline services
units to EDS for $250 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The System One deal represents the biggest acquisition yet
for EDS in a series of moves by the General Motors Corp. unit
to buy all or part of major customers as a way to establish
footholds in new markets. EDS will get all of System One's
software and 2,200 former System One employees.
   As part of the agreement, EDS will provide data processing
to Continental, based in Houston, and to Eastern Airlines,
each of which will be a 25% owner of the new partnership.
Eastern was a unit of Continental until earlier this year,
when a bankruptcy court put the airline under the supervision
of a trustee.
   The agreement with EDS requires approval by the bankruptcy
judge overseeing Eastern's reorganization, and an EDS
official said no money would be released until then. A
hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 3.

   Lithuania to U.S.: Don't Sell Us Out

   VILNIUS, Lithuania -- The final round of the so-called 4 +
2 talks on German unification is scheduled to get under way
tomorrow in Moscow. After 45 years, the end of the postwar
division of that nation and of Europe is at hand. Yet the
fact that the session could set down some of the essential
conditions for a long-delayed World War II peace treaty has
alarmed the recently elected leaders of the Baltic states.
They fear nothing less than a second Molotov-Ribbentrop
sell-out.
   The Council of the Baltic States, comprising the heads of
the Baltic governments and parliaments, will hold a news
conference in Moscow today at which it will express a "deep
concern that the resolution of the German question may be
held to be the final step in the liquidation of the
consequences of World War II, and that the fate of the
Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, and the Republic
of Lithuania will once again be decided without the knowledge
of our Peoples." If that should happen, of course, the U.S.
would be a party to it, as would Britain and France.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Vytautas Landsbergis, president of Lithuania's Supreme
Council, told me in an interview a few days ago that from the
point of view of the Baltic states, a formal reunification of
Germany is by no means the end of the World War II story.
"Three countries are still the victims of that war," Mr.
Landsbergis asserts. "The Baltic countries have not regained
their independence as promised in the Atlantic Charter."
   While he doesn't think the Moscow meeting is likely to
produce a final peace treaty, Mr. Landsbergis fears
agreements that might involve "the principle of not changing
borders between Germany and Eastern countries, including the
Soviet Union. If these statements would purport to fix the
Soviet Union's borders, it would be a new Munich. It would
not necessarily have to be recognition of the annexation --
that would be inconceivable. But it could be done in some
indirect way, and this is our problem."
   Mr. Landsbergis worries that the U.S. in its desire to get
Soviet cooperation in the Gulf crisis could overlook the
interests of the Baltic states. In fact, he is concerned that
Sunday's meeting between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev may
have already prepared the ground for such a deal. The Balts
take little comfort from the lukewarm support of the West for
their sovereignty drives. They are sure of one thing only,
that the Kremlin will try to derail their efforts.
   The West's attitude nevertheless could be critical. Mr.
Landsbergis believes that when Western governments sternly
warned Mr. Gorbachev not to use force in his showdown with
Lithuania earlier this year, they tipped the scale in the
republic's favor. But Mr. Landsbergis doesn't disguise his
disappointment that the West fails to use its leverage more.
   "Western recognition of our governments and the
establishment of diplomatic contacts is what we would
prefer," he says. "That could worsen the West's diplomatic
contacts with the Soviet Union a little. But we think that
the West is too careful; too careful, not to risk any
complications with the Soviets. They could push the Soviets
back more strongly, because the Soviets are collapsing and
are pulling back from all conquests and this pull-back could
include the Baltics."
   The Kremlin has called off its economic blockade, which
had turned out to be at least seven times as costly for the
Soviet Union as for Lithuania in ruble terms. But it has
resorted to more subtle tactics to prevent Baltic
independence. There is much evidence of attempts at delaying,
distracting and dividing the states in their determined
campaign for independence.
   Lithuania agreed to defuse the crisis with the Kremlin by
accepting a moratorium on its March 11 declaration of
sovereignty, for example. But the moratorium was linked to
the start of negotiations on sovereignty. A deadline for the
talks has passed, and the Baltic states are waiting, perhaps
in vain, for the Soviet side to respond to an initial
protocol for negotiations delivered to the Kremlin a month
ago. Amid growing opposition in the republics by those who
fear that their leaders may accept less than full
independence, the Baltic Council last week asked for a
meeting between Baltic leaders and Mr. Gorbachev.
   Overt blackmail is again part of the Soviet strategy.
"They are threatening us," Mr. Landsbergis says. "Either we
accept the central government's proposals on a union treaty
or we can look forward to a winter without supplies of energy
and fuel." The proposed treaty, which is purported to make
secession possible, is really a trap in that it sets
obstacles in the way of secession; the only way to escape the
trap is not to sign the treaty at all. That, according to
Lithuanian parliamentarians, is the intention of the Baltic
states.
   The Kremlin's economic blackmail is combined with some
apparently artificial shortages of consumer products.
Gasoline supplies are spotty. Sugar is limited to one kilo a
month per person, soap to one cake and wine to one liter.
Such products, made and distributed by the state, are turning
up on black markets at sharply higher prices.
   The KGB and Moscow have attempted to establish alternative
government institutions in Lithuania, Mr. Landsbergis says,
"especially at the prosecutorial level. But they don't
succeed. The so-called general prosecutor sent by Moscow is
entirely isolated. And, Moscow's attempt to present the
Lithuanian Communist Party as a real political force is
simply not serious -- without monetary and political support
from Moscow it would just disappear."
   "The KGB and central institutions are very much interested
in destabilizing the situation in Lithuania," Mr. Landsbergis
believes. "They are trying to sharpen national differences
among the Baltic peoples and among Russians, Poles and
Ukrainians. The official press and radio broadcasts from
military bases disseminate much disinformation." They are not
so successful here as they have been in areas such as the
South Central republics, he says, and the new governments
have much support among non-Baltic residents.
   As examples of disinformation, Mr. Landsbergis shows
newspaper clippings that paint even czarist Russia as having
been kind to non-Russian peoples in the empire, without a
trace of attempts at Russification in the Baltics. But even
young Lithuanians know better. A 21-year-old cites an
infamous and failed attempt in czarist times to force the use
of the Cyrillic alphabet in Lithuanian literature. All
recognize the cynicism of communists who turned a Vilnius
Roman Catholic church into a museum for atheism while they
allowed the communist-controlled Russian Orthodox Church to
build new churches.
   Cultures seldom succumb to persecution; indeed, they are
often fortified by the attempt. Lithuanian partisans were the
last to give up armed resistance to Stalin's domination,
fighting into the 1950s. The family history of almost every
living Lithuanian includes imprisonment, deportation or
murder at the hands of communists.
   Balts are not asking the West to do their fighting for
them today, either. They are simply demanding that the World
War II Allies cut no deals over their heads. As the Baltic
Council's statement argues, the fate of the three republics
"is not an internal matter of the U.S.S.R."

   John Morrell &amp; Co., a unit of Chiquita Brands
International Inc., said the federal appeals court in
Minneapolis, Minn., upheld two verdicts in the company's
favor, including a damage award now valued at about $27
million.
   The court cases stem from a United Food and Commercial
Workers Union strike in 1987 at Morrell's Sioux Falls, S.D.,
plant. Morrell sells processed and fresh meats.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1988, a federal jury in Rapid City, S.D., determined
that the strike was illegal, and awarded Morrell damages of
$24.6 million. With accrued interest, this award against the
union now has a value of about $27 million, the company said.
   The court also upheld a related case that involved
Morrell's refusing to give back pay to the strikers.
   James Lyons, president of local 304A of the United Food
and Commerical Workers in Sioux Falls, said lawyers at the
international union are considering appealing the decision,
but haven't yet made a decision. Mr. Lyons said the union
already had raised the cash, in the form of treasury bonds,
for the payment.
   Officials at the international union couldn't be reached
for comment.

   Little Progress Made on Budget-Reduction Pact

   NEW YORK -- Rising oil prices and reports that
congressional negotiators are not even close to forging a
credible budget-reduction accord gave investors new reasons
to bail out of bonds.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 1/2 point
lower, a loss of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its
price, rose to 8.96% from 8.91% on Friday.

<TEXT>
   Tax-exempt municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities
followed the Treasury market step-by-step.
   But junk bonds, ignoring the declines in the Treasury and
stock markets, posted gains of between 1/4 and 1/2 points.
   "Junk bonds moved up early with equities and somehow held
on to those advances despite a late-day sell off in the stock
market," said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's
Investors Service Inc. He said the gains were exaggerated by
the extremely thin trading conditions.
   "I would not read too much in the way of substance," into
the junk bond rally, said Mr. Lonski. If oil prices remain
above $30 a barrel when the market opens today, he said, junk
bond prices are likely to fall.
   The broader bond market also opened higher yesterday. But
prices of Treasurys, municipals, investment-grade corporates
and many other fixed-income securities reversed directions on
disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not push
short-term interest rates lower and on talk that budget
negotiations have stalled.
   The talks are moving so slowly that President Bush
canceled a planned meeting yesterday morning with the budget
negotiators. Prior to that announcement, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady commented on ABC-TV that the budget talks "are
going nowhere fast."
   John Costas, co-head of government trading at First Boston
Corp., said investors reacted negatively to the news because
without a budget accord, the government will continue to
borrow heavily in the credit markets to finance its spending
habits.
   Some economists argue that the government's immense
borrowing needs are keeping interest rates relatively high.
Moreover, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said on numerous
occasions that he would cut interest rates if Congress and
the Administration significantly reduced the budget deficit.
   Without some agreement to reduce the deficit or alter the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, about $85 billion in
across-the-board spending cuts will be triggered Oct. 1.
   Mr. Costas said news about the budget negotiations and
disappointment that the Fed failed to ease short-term rates
"softened up the market." But, he added, "the market
deterioration accelerated after the oil price increase."
   October crude oil futures settled at $31.30 a barrel, up
$1.26 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Bond prices have been falling for weeks due to fears that
rising oil prices, a trend that was precipitated by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, will accelerate inflation. Rising prices
greatly reduce the appeal and attraction of fixed-income
securities.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Short-term interest rates were mixed at yesterday's weekly
government Treasury bill auction.
   The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.41%
and the average rate on six-month bills was 7.34%. The rate
on three-month bills was up from last week's auction when it
was 7.39%. But the rate on six-month bills was down from the
previous auction when it was 7.36%.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

8.91%. Prices of two-year notes ended at 100 3/32 to yield
8.05%, the price was down from 100 7/32 to yield 7.98% on
Friday.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds, which have been the worst performing segment
of the bond market in recent weeks, were the only major
sector to post gains yesterday.
   Most of the high-yield, speculative-grade securities
finished between 1/4 to 1/2 point higher.
   Among the key gainers in the high-yield market were junk
bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. The tobacco and food company's
17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures finished up 1 3/4
points to 112 on the New York Stock Exchange after advancing
as high as 112 5/8 earlier. RJR's 17% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures ended one point higher 88 7/8.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds ended between 1/4 to 3/8 point lower. Among
new issues, a group led by Bear Stearns &amp; Co. won a $250
million issue of General Electric Capital Corp. three-year
notes. GE Capital is a unit of General Electric Co.
   The notes will be reoffered with an 8.45% coupon at a
price of 99.922 to yield 8.48%. Bear Stearns won the issue
with a bid of 99.753, which resulted in a net interest cost
to the company of 8.545%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were unchanged to 3/8 point lower in light
dealings.
   Among active bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
issue of 2018 slipped 3/8 point to 97 7/8, to yield 7.37%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   The mortgage-securities market erased early moderate
gains.
   In the secondary mortgage securities market, Government
National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue for September
delivery was down 14/32 at 98 14/32.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue for
September delivery was off 11/32 at 98 3/32. Federal National
Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue for September delivery
was down 11/32 at 98 21/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Rising short-term interest rates caused the Japanese
government bond market to end weaker again despite a stronger
yen.
   The yield on December Euroyen interest rate futures was
8.69% yesterday, up from 8.60% on Friday. Rates on new
three-month certificates of deposit were 8.38%, up from
8.34%. Meanwhile, the dollar ended at 139.55 yen, down from
140.05 yen in late Friday in New York.
   In trading, the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese bond
ended at a price of 82.42, down 0.04 points from Friday. The
yield rose to 8.26%. (When calculated using the semi-annual
compound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.57%,
according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   British and West German government bonds were moderately
higher.

12-year, 12% cumulative preferred stock, and one-fifth share
of Trism common stock for each of its shares outstanding.
   Builders Transport, a truckload carrier based in Camden,

million in equity into a new unit that would acquire Builders
Transport. Trism would finance the balance of the transaction
with senior debt and a preferred stock investment from Heller

it might revise the proposal of $12 cash and $4 a share in
12-year, 12% cumulative preferred stock, but instead made the
new offer. Builders Transport has about five million shares
outstanding. Builders Transport said that it could not
immediately provide the value of the offer.
   Separately, Builders Transport said it agreed to sell its
refrigerated-van operation as part of a restructuring. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   Builders Transport also said a Delaware Chancery Court

   BCE Agrees

   MONTREAL -- BCE Inc., giving up for good on the energy
business, said it agreed to sell its 48.8% stake in
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. for about C$1.3 billion ($1.1
billion) to a group of Canadian investment dealers for
subsequent sale to the public.
   A BCE spokesman said the company decided to take advantage
of an opportunity to sell TransCanada "because it really
isn't consistent with our core" telecommunications and
financial services businesses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The spokesman added that a number of BCE subsidiaries have
heavy capital spending programs under way and so does
TransCanada. Disposing of its stake in the Calgary, Alberta,
pipeline company will free resources for a push into overseas
telecommunications markets, the spokesman said.
   TransCanada said that BCE's sale of its stake won't hurt
the pipeline concern's ability to raise funds for its
projects. "We are quite confident of our ability to complete
our pipeline projects," TransCanada said in a statement.
   The sale marks the end of Montreal-based BCE's current
effort to slim down. In a similar transaction, BCE disposed
of most its stake in oil and gas concern Encor Inc. earlier
this year. BCE also abandoned a disastrous foray into the
real estate business earlier this year when it wrote off its
stake in BCE Development Corp.
   In a two-step transaction BCE said it will sell 37,500,000
units at C$17.00 a unit, or a total of C$637.5 million, to a
group of 10 Canadian investment dealers.
   Each unit will consist of one TransCanada share and a
warrant to purchase one TransCanada share from BCE at C$17.50
until Dec. 15, 1992. If all the warrants are exercized BCE
will receive an additional C$656.3 million. BCE said the
units won't be offered in the U.S.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
TransCanada closed at $14.375, down 25 cents. BCE's
announcement of the sale of its stake was made following the
market's close.
   The investment dealers will pay for the units in two
parts. A first payment of C$328.1 million will be made on
closing of the transaction in October. The remaining C$309.4
million is payable by Oct. 1, 1991.
   BCE said it will realize a pretax gain of about C$147
million (C$119 million after tax) on the sale of the units
and will realize a similar gain if all the warrants are
exercised.
   Also, BCE said the transaction will have an ongoing
favorable impact on its earnings, but a spokesman declined to
quantify that impact. BCE said the proceeds of the sale will
be used principally to reduce short-term debt.
   TransCanada and BCE said the 10 underwriters agreed to
seek a wide distribution for the shares.

   LOS ANGELES -- Financial Corp. of America's bankruptcy
trustee has sued several federal government agencies for
allegedly causing the company to lose more than $1 billion
prior to the government's 1988 takeover of the company's
American Savings &amp; Loan Association subsidiary.
   Trustee David A. Gill's complaint, filed in federal court
here, also names as defendants 10 former officers and
directors of Financial Corp., including former Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer William Popejoy, for allegedly
mismanaging the company between September 1984 and September
1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Popejoy, reached at his home in Orange County, Calif.,
said he hadn't seen the complaint and couldn't comment. Mr.
Popejoy is currently employed by an affiliate of Robert M.
Bass Group Inc., which purchased American Savings from the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board in December 1988.
   Among other things, the complaint charges that the Bank
Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. had conflicts of interests
as American creditors when they forced Financial Corp. into
an operating agreement as a condition for future financial
advances in 1984.
   At that time, the regulators installed Mr. Popejoy and the
other directors at Financial Corp. and American Savings where
they allegedly followed agency orders rather than exercise
independent judgment. Since the agencies were creditors of
American Savings but not of Financial Corp., it was in their
interest to transfer assets to the thrift at less than fair
value, the complaint said.
   The allegedly improper transactions included the sale at
excessive discounts of millions of dollars in loans and real
estate by FCA Credit Corp. to American Savings and the
transfer of 1900 high desert lots, millions of dollars in
unexplained transfers from a Financial Corp. account at
American Savings, and the payment by American Savings of
below-market interest in the Financial Corp. account.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages.

   But at the same time, the Los Angeles-based entertainment
company and the directors filed a lawsuit against three

agreeing to the settlement. MGM/UA attorney Terry Christensen
called the insurers' action "a sneak attack."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If approved Friday by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge,
all defendants, including MGM/UA as a corporation, would be
dropped from the litigation except majority shareholder Kirk
Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. The suits allege that when
MGM/UA was acquired by Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. in
1986, United Artists assets were sold back to Mr. Kerkorian
at an unfairly undervalued price, $470 million.
   The remaining litigation against Mr. Kerkorian, who is not
insured by the three companies, is set to go to trial in Los
Angeles Superior Court Sept. 24.
   The insurance concerns are Forum Insurance Co. of Chicago,
Associated International Insurance Co. of Los Angeles and
National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh.

   Emerald Homes L.P. posted a second-quarter loss of $10.2
million, or $1.94 a unit, and said it is seeking capital to
help it restructure its debt and obtain new borrowings.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the Phoenix-based home
builder had net income of $478,000, or six cents a unit.
Revenue in the latest quarter plunged 39% to $13.3 million
from $21.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Emerald said its loss included a $4.5 million reserve,
representing the full amount of Emerald's investment in Quail
Creek Country Club L.P., and a $2.4 million loss from the
sale of Homeplex Mortgage Investments Corp. common stock.
   "Our housing sales are still strong in Phoenix despite the
difficult real-estate market and slowing economy," said Lewis
J. Wright, president and chief executive officer. But Emerald
said it had an operating loss in the period due to slim
margins and to interest expense on land bought before Arizona
real-estate values fell.
   "We're hoping to restructure that debt," said James E.
Teiman, chief financial officer. Mr. Teiman said the
partnership is about $1 million in arrears on loan payments
to two financial institutions that have been taken over by
the Office of Thrift Supervision's Resolution Trust Corp.
Meanwhile, the company said it is having difficulty obtaining
construction financing.

   Dell Computer Switches Its Strategy,
   Agrees to Sell Through Soft Warehouse

   In a major sales strategy shift, mail-order company Dell
Computer Corp. will sell its full line of personal computers
through 13 Soft Warehouse Superstores nationwide starting
Oct. 1. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   One of the first and most successful mail-order computer
companies, Dell, based in Austin, Texas, previously shunned
conventional retail channels. Dell chairman Michael S. Dell
said in an interview last year, "We don't believe retail
stores are the more efficient way to sell these products."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But analysts said that Dell has since discovered the
limitations of mail-order marketing. "Large corporations will
only buy so many computers over the phone," said computer
retailing analyst Seymour Merrin of Merrin Information
Services.
   The 25-year-old Mr. Dell said yesterday that selling
through retail will help him reach less-technical users and
increase future revenue. "It's not the only way for us to
grow," he said, "but it's a substantial way." Dell will
continue selling through mail-order.
   The exclusive sales agreement, in force through 1993, is a
boost for Soft Warehouse Inc., which has been in search of
more recognizable brand names for its deep-discount warehouse
stores. The closely held retail chain, which is based in
Dallas, normally discounts its products from 30% to 80%. But
to ensure it won't be undercut by Dell's mail-order
operation, the retail chain plans to sell Dell computers at
their usual mail-order prices, said Soft Warehouse president
Nathan Morton.
   The arrangement isn't without risk for Dell. To make the
Soft Warehouse contract worth Dell's investment of time and
resources, Dell must do at least 10% of its business, roughly
$50 million in sales, through retail, said Stewart Alsop II,
publisher of the P.C. Letter. Mr. Merrin doesn't think that
will be a problem, predicting the computer maker will sell at
least $100 million in the first year of the agreement.
   But if the company loses too many sales to Soft Warehouse,
it will cut into Dell's profit margins, said Wall Street
analyst Eric C. Zimits, of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes. Dell will
sell computers to Soft Warehouse at a discount.
   Founded in 1984 by Mr. Dell, who assembled and sold
computers in his college dormitory room, Dell Computer was a
pioneer in the mail-order marketing of personal computers. As
the company grew, Mr. Dell hired top engineers from companies
such as International Business Machines Corp. to design and
build higher performance computer systems that would appeal
to corporate users.
   Dell also added services such as toll-free telephone
support and next-day repair. The strategy paid off: nearly
half of Dell's customers are large corporations and sales are
expected to top $500 million in fiscal 1991, compared with
$388.6 million in fiscal 1990 ended in February.
   The move into retail comes on the heels of several recent
major Dell product announcements. The products, with powerful
features and aggressive pricing, were aimed at Compaq
Computer Corp. of Houston, which sells its products through
computer stores only.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Dell
shares closed at $12.50, up 25 cents.
   In an unrelated announcement Friday, Soft Warehouse said
it indefinitely postponed its initial public stock offering
set for the fall. Because of the crisis in the Middle East,
the market is too volatile for a stock offering, Mr. Morton
said. The company did not announce how much it planned to
raise, but it said the postponement won't affect expansion
plans.

   Tokyo stocks soared Monday, with the Nikkei Index posting
its sixth-largest daily gain in percentage terms.
   London shares closed higher, helped by a firm start to New
York trading but plagued by thin volume and what traders said
is a lack of long-term direction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Traders attributed the sharp gain in Tokyo to a technical
correction on the Nikkei's losses of more than 2000 points
this past week. Moreover, weekend news of a united
U.S.-Soviet stance against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait gave the
market psychological reinforcement and fueled active support
for futures.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues was up 1118.83 points at
25080.90.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index eased 186.60 points to
close the morning session at 24894.30.
   Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 330
million shares, off from 443.3 million shares Friday.
Advancers widely outnumbered losers 925 to 69, while 64
issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section jumped 57.35 points, or 3.11%, at 1903.28.
   The second section index rose 43.96 points, or 1.23%, to
3612.24. Volume in the section was estimated at 4.8 million
shares, down from 6.2 million shares Friday.
   Because volume was so thin, index-linked buying by
investment trust funds ahead of book closings at the end of
the month, as well as heavy arbitrage buying by major
brokerage houses, was easily able to drive up the key index
broadly, traders said.
   Brokerage houses are assisting in pushing up prices so
that investment funds can turn a profit over the next couple
of weeks, traders said.
   Aiding the market's turnaround was a much stronger yen,
noted Amy Yip, manager of sales at Baring Securities. As the
dollar has hit record lows against all major currencies with
the exception of the yen, Ms. Yip said she sees room for the
U.S. unit to fall further against the Japanese currency over
the next month.
   Although Ms. Yip sees some potential for the Nikkei Index
to slip 2000 points, barring extraordinary circumstances
linked to the Middle East crisis, she says the greater
likelihood is for a technical rebound of 3000 points upward.
   Ms. Yip partly bases her outlook on the expectation that
the yen will strengthen to 130 yen to the dollar within the
month.
   But she noted that "the yen is only one hurdle we have
cleared." Oil prices and interest rates, on the other hand,
won't come down from their high levels so soon, she said. And
while money markets are providing decent, guaranteed yields
of about 8%, stocks are still seen as hazardous.
   In addition, volatility is expected to increase later in
the week because Thursday is the last day of trading on
September options and futures, while window-dressers will
need to take profits, observers warned.
   But as investors try to judge the outlook for Tokyo
stocks, small chunks of buying should support prices in the
immediate near term, traders said. Greater buying
opportunities will arise, Ms. Yip said, as volume increases.
   Meanwhile, traders noted that Monday afternoon comments by
Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi Mieno regarding the central bank's
watchful eye on inflationary pressures choked buying for a
short period.
   But the official then said that the "Iraq shock" remains
manageable at $30 a barrel, compared with the blows dealt to
the Japanese economy by the two oil shocks in the 1970s.
Buying flooded into futures after the comments and then
spread into cash indexes, traders said.
   Stock prices were higher across the board Monday, but
particularly strong gainers included construction, financial
and shipbuilding shares.
   Nippon Hodo rose 160 yen to 2790 yen ($1.14 to $19.91),
while Misawa Homes jumped 140 yen to 1900 yen. Maeda
Construction added 50 yen to 1620 yen, and Kajima gained 70
yen to 1400 yen.
   Sumitomo Bank added 40 yen to 1830 yen, Mitsubishi Bank
gained 80 yen to 1930 yen, Nomura Securities gained 80 yen to
1700 yen, and Nikko Securities jumped 48 yen to 898 yen.
   Meanwhile, Wall Street's strong showing throughout the
course of London trading, maintained by a weaker oil price,
was keeping the London market firm, traders said. "If Wall
Street had opened easier, London would have drifted off," one
trader said.
   Apart from New York's lead, traders said there was a clear
lack of direction in the market. "London is so up and
downpeople just aren't committed to holding positions," one
trader said.
   Despite the weekend's show of solidarity between the U.S.
and Soviet Union over events in the Middle East, uncertainty
over the future of the region is still dominating the market,
traders said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
24.1 points to 2147.0, as the Financial Times 30 Share Index
closed up 16.6 at 1655.1. Volume was 296.4 million shares,
down from Friday's 331.8 million shares.
   The main trading activity of the day was seen in Polly
Peck, where 19 million shares changed hands. Market makers
speculated that company Chairman Asil Nadir might be trying
to rebuild his stake. Polly Peck officials were unavailable
to comment, and the company's brokers, Shearson Lehman Hutton
Securities, declined to comment. The share price climbed 13
pence to 275 pence (25 cents to $5.21).
   Rugby Group, which reported a 14% fall in pretax profit on
weaker performances in most of the company's operations, had
a 5 pence drop to 121 pence.
   Reckitt &amp; Colman jumped 29 pence to #12.23 on the back of
last week's positive interim earnings figures.
   Positive expectations prior to British Aerospace's
disclosure of interim results Wednesday caused a 12 pence
increase to 550 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher at all European stock
markets, except Zurich, which was closed for a national
holiday. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   And stocks ended higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Taipei and Wellington, were mixed in Seoul, and lower in
Manila.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   Rising above downtown Atlanta is what John Portman hopes
will be his crowning achievement: an unfinished, tower of
granite and glass that is meant once and for all to quiet the
critics who have for years reviled his hulking, atrium-style
hotels and corporate centers.
   The 65-year-old developer and architect of such projects
as the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco and the Mariott
Marquis hotel in New York's Times Square has dreamed of
building this tower for 25 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So anxious has he been to complete the dream design for
what he calls One Peachtree Center that he unveiled it
several years ago before he had either financing or an anchor
tenant. He produced a coffee table book featuring likenesses
of the structure before he had even started building it.
   To finance construction of the $300 million skyscraper, he
personally guaranteed a loan of $78 million as equity.
(Citicorp provided the entire $378 million in loans.) He also
took tenants for the planned 60-story structure away from
other buildings he had developed nearby.
   Now, there are signs that Mr. Portman's financial empire
may be crumbling. And some developers and lenders say One
Peachtree Center is looking less like a monument to Mr.
Portman than a monumental folly.
   Already, Mr. Portman has missed a $3 million loan
repayment to DG Bank Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, which has
filed suit to collect. He has been in emergency meetings with
many of his 22 creditors to restructure the collateral on
more than $2 billion of loans. And as of Sept. 1, he stopped
making payments to Equitable Life Assurances Society of the
U.S. on a $333 million mortgage covering another of Mr.
Portman's projects in Atlanta, called Peachtree Center, which
opened in 1970.
   Though Mr. Portman says the missed mortgage payment to
Equitable is just a temporary "technical" glitch, he is also
missing payments on tens of millions of dollars of personal
lines of credit with a number of lenders. Those funds have
been helping pay for the Portman Cos.' operations on three
continents.
   Sitting in his Peachtree Center office yesterday,
surrounded by his own abstract paintings, two advisers and
his son, Jack, Mr. Portman insisted in an interview that his
business is still more than solvent.
   Mr. Portman says he's in "friendly" negotiations with
Equitable on a broad financial package covering the Peachtree
Center property, which he says isn't facing a cash flow
shortage.
   He blames the savings and loan crisis and the overbuilt
real estate market for sparking panic among his unsecured
lenders -- one that he insists isn't warranted in his case.
   His unsecured lenders, he says, "for the first time in 10
years" called their lines of credit for payment this summer,
rather than revolving those loans as usual and accepting
repayment at the end of the year. With insufficient cash on
hand, Mr. Portman says, he and his advisers are trying to put
together a collateral pool comprised of future cash flows and
his interests in various real estate partnerships. If the
lenders approve their plan, the pool will serve as security
for the lines of credit, and the spigot of cash will continue
to flow.
   "We came into 1990, and suddenly real estate is a bad
word," quips Mr. Portman.
   Citicorp and Equitable declined to comment. The unsecured
lenders all either couldn't be reached or declined to
comment.
   Kenneth Leventhal, the work-out specialist who helped
restructure Donald Trump's troubled finances and who is
assisting Mr. Portman with his, says lenders are cooperating
so far.
   But executives close to Portman Cos. say additional
collateral may be more difficult to come by than Mr.
Leventhal suggests. Though Mr. Portman still owns large
equity positions in several of his successful developments,
most of those assets have already been refinanced and pledged
as collateral to mortgage holders. With real estate values
falling, they say, it may be difficult to convince creditors
that Mr. Portman's holdings are worth more than the mortgages
on many of the properties.
   While Mr. Portman may not be as big as Donald Trump or as
far-flung as Trammell Crow, he has had widespread influence.
While his atrium-style hotels and giant centers like
Embarcadero and the Renaissance Center in Detroit have been
generally panned by critics, they have been major hits with
the public and much copied by other builders, lending
credence to his claim as "the people's architect."
   Mr. Portman has never been embraced by the business and
social elite in Atlanta. Part of the reason Mr. Portman
failed to launch One Peachtree Center any earlier is that he
couldn't get any of Atlanta's businesses to be his anchor
tenant. Since the mid-1960's, he had shown variations of the
signature skyscraper proposal to some of Atlanta's biggest
employers, including Coca-Cola, AT&amp;T, and most recently,
First Atlanta Bank. But all, for various reasons, turned him
down.
   His summer place at Sea Island, Ga., an unusual,
museum-like chain of several atriums called Entelechy II,
packed with his own art, appalled many of the elite
homeowners on the island who found it obtrusive.
   "You've got to remember, this is the antebellum South,"
Mr. Portman says.
   The cause of the cash crunch that is pinching Mr. Portman
and his Portman Cos. is similar to that which recently
brought Donald Trump to the brink of bankruptcy. Like Mr.
Trump, Mr. Portman gorged on easy credit in the 1980s. In the
past five years, he refinanced nearly $1 billion of mortgages
on his many large properties, and used the proceeds, with
more than $600 million of fresh loans, to finance a building
spree.
   He built a hotel and an apparel mart in San Francisco, a
triple-tower trade center in Shanghai, and two office
buildings, two wholesale marts, an athletic club, a hotel,
and a suburban office park in Atlanta -- in addition to the
office tower now in progress.
   But many of the recent projects have fared poorly, in part
due to the national real estate glut hurting all developers.
In recent years, Mr. Portman added to his mart empire by
building or expanding four wholesale marts at a cost of $500
million in borrowed funds.
   But both his Atlanta apparel mart, which has doubled in
size in the past three years, and his newer San Francisco
mart remain less than 70% occupied. Meanwhile, traffic in
apparel marts is declining nationwide, because their primary
customers, small clothing retailers, are going through an
industry shakeout.
   In addition to the cash drain from managing and marketing
the marts, Mr. Portman has a $140 million construction loan
due next year on the Atlanta mart's expansion. If problems
persist, that loan may be difficult to refinance.
   "Boy, I bet they're sorry they doubled their space," says
Dorothy Fuller, director of the Chicago Apparel Center, owned
by Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises.
   Moreover, Mr. Portman faces severe problems in his new,
$150 million technology mart in Atlanta, which sits
two-thirds empty.
   But his other marts, Mr. Portman says, which house
showrooms for the carpet, furniture and gift industries, are
thriving, as is his trade-show promotion company, the third
largest in the U.S. And Mr. Portman maintains it's only a
matter of time until the apparel and technology marts come
around, too. "Marts are among our most successful
businesses," he says.
   Mr. Portman lost roughly $50 million on an aborted attempt
to launch the first of what was to be his own line of pricey
hotels, beginning with the former Portman Hotel in San
Francisco. The hotel was built in 1987 and is one of the only
buildings Mr. Portman has ever sold. He received roughly $100
million for it, or about the size of the construction loan
outstanding on the project.
   Lost were about $25 million in cost overruns and about the
same amount in operating shortfalls. Mr. Portman says the
hotel's problems were numerous, but basically, guests weren't
willing to pay $200 per night and up for the lavish service
he was trying to provide.
   And Mr. Portman has launched a risky foray into the
Atlanta suburban office market, taking on high carrying costs
on land that is undevelopable in the current market.
   Though Mr. Portman's problems are similar to those of
other debt-laden developers in today's market, they're also
different. As a hybrid architect-developer, Mr. Portman has
always operated on the premise that his superior designs can
make projects work that otherwise wouldn't seem to make
sense. That's exactly what he accomplished with the Atlanta
Hyatt Regency. When the building was finished in 1967, many
hotel experts scoffed at its soaring atrium, which looked
wasteful. But the public loved the vibrant expanse, and the
Regency's atrium style became one of the most emulated hotel
designs of the century, sparking a new standard of downtown
chic.
   Developers who know Mr. Portman well, however, say his
faith in the power of his own designs -- and his
determination to win over his many critics in the
architecture world before retiring -- can also lead to bad
decisions. That's what happened with One Peachtree Center,
many Atlantans say.
   For years, Mr. Portman's career has been dogged by a
dichotomy. Though people have flocked to his giant complexes
in Atlanta, New York, Detroit and San Francisco -- helping
revitalize the central cities and making Mr. Portman one of
the nation's most successful developers -- architecture
critics have reviled his work.
   In Detroit, a reviewer for the Detroit News once wrote
that the Portman-designed Renaissance Center evoked "a sense
of imprisonment." The New York Times' architecture critic
called Mr. Portman's tourist-mobbed Mariott Marquis on Times
Square, "bombastic." And guidebook-writer Arthur Frommer
labeled his bustling hotels in Atlanta's Peachtree Center,
"fortresses with forbidding walls."
   The new tower in Atlanta, slated for completion in 1992,
is Mr. Portman's answer to critics. Designs call for
surrounding the granite and glass structure with trees,
fountains and open spaces -- features that are normally found
inside a Portman project.
   The building will have "a quality and uniqueness
indigenous to our time," Mr. Portman says.
   But is the time right? While the office-vacancy rate in
Atlanta indicates otherwise, Mr. Portman's damn-the-torpedoes
attitude may have been spurred on by territorialism more than
anything else, according to local developers. Over the last
several years, a slew of big-name architects, including John
Burgee, Philip Johnson and Kevin Roche have designed
buildings for Atlanta. Mr. Portman wouldn't be edged out of
his own backyard, they say.
   "You've got some world-class stuff going up down there,
and I think John's response was that he can do that, too,"
says C. Mack Taylor, an old friend and a partner in Taylor &amp;
Mathis Real Estate, a large Atlanta-based firm.
   Taylor &amp; Mathis itself is one of two developers that have
killed their own plans for downtown towers. The firm had
lease commitments for 63% of its $280 million building. But
the 1.15 million-square-foot project was scuttled earlier
this year when financing costs rose and effective rents kept
plummeting.
   "People aren't willing to pay for premier space in today's
market," sighs Mr. Taylor.
   The office vacancy rate in downtown Atlanta is now at 16%
and rising. New vacancies exceed new leases by some 1,500
square feet a day, according to Coldwell Banker Commercial
Group Inc., creating the dreaded condition known in the real
estate industry as "negative absorption." Brokers only expect
the market to worsen, as One Peachtree Center and two other
large towers add 3.6 million square feet, or 31% more space,
to the market by 1993.
   "Most people say One Peachtree probably shouldn't have
been built," says Randy Garfield Jr., an assistant vice
president with Coldwell Banker Commercial. "But it's like
turning a ship at sea. Was he too far along?"
   Says another developer who has worked closely with Mr.
Portman: "John wanted to prove something to the world."

   RJR Nabisco Seeks
   To Sell to Hearst
   Its Stake in ESPN

   NEW YORK -- After nearly a year of futile efforts to sell
its 20% stake in the ESPN sports channel, RJR Nabisco Inc.
may have found a buyer in Hearst Corp., which already is a
partner in two cable channels with ESPN's majority owner,
Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
   But although talks between Hearst and RJR are under way,
no agreement has been reached, and a final sale price may
fall well below the $250 million that debt-laden RJR Nabisco
had originally sought. People familiar with the discussions,
reported yesterday in Advertising Age magazine, said Hearst
may end up paying $180 million to $200 million for the 20%
interest if the sale goes through.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hearst executives couldn't be reached, and RJR declined to
comment. Herb Granath, president of Capital Cities/ABC's
cable division, declined to comment on any discussions,
saying it was a matter for RJR and Hearst. But he did say
Hearst would make sense as a partner. "We've been together in
other ventures, so this would be somewhat logical," he said.
   Separately, ESPN promoted its No. 2 executive, Steven
Bornstein, to succeed Roger L. Werner Jr. as president and
chief executive officer of the sports channel. Mr. Werner
resigned last week to head up a new regional-sports venture
owned by cable investor Bill Daniels.
   ESPN has been enormously successful, reaching 61% of the
nation's cable homes. The cable network earned upward of $125
million in pretax profit last year, though profit this year
is expected to fall to $90 million because of losses on the
channel's first season of high-cost major league baseball
games. RJR Nabisco has been frustrated in finding a buyer for
its piece of ESPN because the stake carries no management
authority or even a guarantee of an annual dividend.
   Those areas are under the sole control of Capital
Cities/ABC, which owns the other 80% of ESPN. A litany of
prospective bidders -- including such Japanese concerns as
Sumitomo Group -- have expressed interest in owning the
smaller stake but have balked at those terms.
   But Hearst officials are less fretful over such matters,
given their current relationship with Capital Cities/ABC.
Hearst owns about one-third of the Arts &amp; Entertainment
channel, in which Capital Cities/ ABC holds a 38% stake and
General Electric Co.'s NBC network owns the remainder. Hearst
also owns about one-third of Lifetime, in which Capital
Cities/ABC holds one-third ownership and Viacom Inc. holds
the remaining chunk.

   Your Money Matters:
   Bank Customers Gain Faster Access
   To Funds, but It's a Two-Way Street

   Bank customers are getting faster access to funds
deposited in their accounts under new federal banking rules
that took effect Sept. 1.
   But there's a catch. Now customers have got to put money
in their accounts more quickly to cover the checks they
write. And in some cases, banks are imposing new limits on
customers who make deposits in automated teller machines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These changes are due to the final phase of a 1987 federal
law that directs banks, thrifts and credit unions to give
customers quicker access to funds deposited in their
accounts. That also means that accounts are being debited
more quickly.
   For checks written on another local bank or other
financial institution, depositors are getting use of the
money within two business days after the day of deposit.
That's one day sooner than they had been getting it since the
last prior speed-up in check-clearing in 1988.
   For checks written on a nonlocal institution, the funds
must now be available within five business days after the day
of deposit, instead of seven. As before, funds deposited in
the form of cashier's checks, certified checks and government
checks must be available the next business day.
   The new schedule for funds availability is part of an
effort to wring "float" out of the nation's financial system.
Float is the time that elapses between the moment a check is
deposited in a customer's account, the bank verifies that the
check writer has an ample balance to cover the check, and the
money is actually credited to the customer's account.
   Many consumers long have used that time-lag to pay bills
by check when their accounts lacked sufficient funds.
Usually, they were counting on adequate funds being in their
account by the time the check was presented for payment. With
the new clearing schedule, that free ride is shorter.
   But there are others who say the tightening of the
check-clearing process is long overdue. Many consumers have
long believed that bankers have dragged out the
check-clearing process to use the float for their own
benefit.
   A 1986 survey by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group
found that 53% of the 458 banks and thrifts that it surveyed
held local checks anywhere from three to five days before
crediting an account, and that 76% held out-of-state checks
for more than one week.
   But in the zeal to reduce float, bankers say, lawmakers
have heightened the risk of fraud.
   Bankers have argued that time is needed to catch checks
backed by insufficient funds before money is credited to an
account. While the shorter availability period is little
problem for checks written on accounts with adequate
balances, it poses real problems for returned checks. On
average, it takes more than six business days for a bank to
learn that a check is uncollectible.
   Officials at two large East and West Coast banks say that
they have been able to trace higher incidence in fraud, such
as counterfeit checks, to the tighter clearing schedules.
However, they didn't want their institutions identified and
wouldn't quantify the sums lost to fraud.
   Robert Hutchinson, senior vice president of Manufacturers
Hanover Corp., says, "The trend in terms of fraud involving
checks is definitely up, but it's impossible to determine how
much of the problem is due to faster availability. The
professional crooks are very knowledgeable about the
regulations."
   To counter the fraud risk, banks are taking various steps.
The New York Clearing House Association, a group of large New
York banks, has plans for clearing checks on other
clearinghouse banks the same day that they are deposited.
That will allow the clearinghouse banks to spot
insufficient-funds checks before they are credited to an
account.
   The tighter clearing schedules could prompt some regional
networks of automated teller machines to say they may no
longer accept deposits.
   In August, National Bank of Detroit, a unit of NBD Corp.,
announced that it would no longer allow its customers to make
deposits at other institutions' ATMs. A bank spokeswoman said
risks posed by the shortened availability period prompted the
move.
   And several regional ATM networks, such as the 2,900-ATM
Money Stations network in Ohio, may consider refusing
deposits. Edmond Gough, president of Money Station Inc.,
says, "We're hoping Congress amends the law before it gets to
that."
   Still, it's relatively rare for a bank customer to make a
deposit using an ATM of a bank where he or she doesn't
already have an account. For instance, the Money Station says
that only 5.5% of the 4.5 million transactions that it
handles each month involve such deposits.
   Many had assumed that advances in ATM technology would
allow banks to know within two days whether an account at
another bank had adequate funds.
   But that hasn't happened, although CoreStates Financial
Corp., Philadelphia, is experimenting with an ATM that can
read checks.
   Marcia Z. Sullivan of the Consumer Bankers Association
says, "The problem is that there isn't any way to read both
the amount of the check and the routing code" electronically.
"That has to be done manually, and it's too expensive."
   The Fed has backed the banks up on this and is pushing to
get the law amended so that a bank will have five business
days to credit a deposit made at another bank's ATM for
another four years.
   Edmond Mierzwinski, a consumer advocate with the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group, says, "We agreed not to
oppose the amendment in the Senate, but that's not to say
that we're supporting it. We're unsatisfied with how the
banks have spent the last three years getting ready for this.
They say the only solution is an ATM that reads the code and
the amount."

   House Passes
   Bill to Limit
   Cable-TV Fees

   Bipartisan Support Shown;
   Senate and White House
   May Prove to Be Hurdles

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The House, in a strong show of bipartisan
support, passed on a voice vote a bill that would reregulate
cable television rates for basic service and assist emerging
competitors.
   The bill's swift passage, however, doesn't guarantee
enactment of the legislation this year. The bill faces an
uncertain future in the Senate as well as a veto threat from
the White House.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the House-passed bill, the Federal Communications
Commission would establish a maximum fee that cable operators
could charge for retransmission of broadcast signals, as well
as public education and government channels.
   To discipline so-called bad actors, the FCC would develop
guidelines to identify exorbitant rates, and local or state
authorities would be allowed to step in on a case-by-case
basis when they suspect price gouging. Local cable
authorities would also monitor customer service standards
developed by the FCC.
   While the bill permits cable operators to buy exclusive
programming, it also requires operators to provide their
signals to competitors, such as satellite and microwave
services, in a "reasonable" and "nondiscriminatory" fashion.
   The measure received a swift rebuke from the White House,
which threatened a veto. The White House drew up a laundry
list of complaints, saying that the bill would impose
additional federal regulation over cable rates and hamper
cable programmers' ability to distribute their products.
   In addition, the Bush administration criticized
restrictions on foreign ownership of cable systems,
expressing concern that this would invite retaliation
overseas. And it said the "must carry" requirements, which
spell out cable companies' obligations to carry signals of
broadcast stations in the area, raise First Amendment
questions.
   On similar grounds, it raised concerns about the bill's
requirement that cable operators offer a basic tier of
service that doesn't include special cable programming. As
for competition, the administration reiterated its
recommendation that Congress lift restrictions that bar
telephone companies from entering the cable business, a
suggestion that cable companies adamantly oppose.
   The National Cable Television Association, the industry's
main trade association, expressed dismay with the legislation
but didn't say it would oppose the bill. NCTA President James
Mooney said his group "continues to be deeply troubled by the
legislation" and it remains "an open question whether a
reasonable cable bill" can be enacted this year. "What began
as a consumer issue is now turning into an effort by other
industries to pile on, and hobble cable as a competitor," he
said.
   The cable bill was spurred by sizable increases in monthly
cable fees since rates were largely deregulated in 1987. In
some cases, rates have doubled or tripled, although increases
have moderated in recent months.
   House passage puts pressure on the Senate to take up its
version of cable revision soon, but whether Congress can pass
cable legislation this year remains uncertain. The Senate
measure, which has cleared the Commerce Committee, includes
tougher language on providing programming to competitors but
gives cable operators more leeway to raise rates. Even if the
Senate acts soon, the measures would have to go through a
conference committee to iron out details.
   In the House, Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of
the telecommunications and finance subcommittee and co-author
of the bill along with Rep. Matthew Rinaldo (R., N.J.), said
the bill "addresses real problems in a surgical and balanced
manner." He promised it would provide strong consumer
protection, ignite competition and expand diversity in video
programming.
   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer
Federation of America, applauded the House bill. He called it
"one of the bigger victories for consumers this year because
it combines immediate pocketbook protections with the
promotion of competition to cable down the road."

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter shares ended slightly ahead
despite a late afternoon sell-off sparked by financial-market
rumors of increased tension in the Mideast.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.35 to 381.73, a 0.4%
gain, after being up more than four points before rumors of
escalating conflict in the Mideast squashed investors'
enthusiasm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Volume was a light 98.3 million shares, down from 103.2
million Friday; advancing stocks outpaced declining shares,
966 to 891. The 91 stocks posting new lows exceeded the 24
reaching new highs, a gap somewhat narrower than the vast
differences of recent days.
   "Paralyzed is the word," said Ralph Costanza, head of OTC
trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., explaining that
many investors are steering clear of stocks in the absence of
any major developments in the Persian Gulf or on the economic
front.
   "There's a greater fear of being wrong than of being
late," he said. Some money managers think there is little
room for error if the market drops but plenty of time to step
in and buy stocks if the market recovers, he said.
   Small investors are just about absent from the market,
agreed Mr. Costanza and Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at
Kidder Peabody. Postponement of new issues because of the
market's weakness also contributes to the lackluster trading,
Mr. Costanza added.
   Oracle Systems, the day's most active stock, rebounded 3/8
to 8 1/2. The software maker's shares had skidded 1 3/4
Friday after Oracle said it expected to report its first
quarterly loss ever. Among other technology stocks, Intel
rose 3/4 to 32 1/2, Conner Peripherals added 1 1/4 to 23 1/2,
Sun Microsystems advanced 1 1/4 to 29 5/8 and Novell rose 1/4
to 26.
   Sun appeared yesterday at a Cowen &amp; Co. conference in
Boston; Intel and Novell are scheduled to appear today.
   Also higher were shares of a number of companies scheduled
to appear yesterday at Montgomery Securities' 20th annual
investor conference in San Francisco.
   Aldus jumped 7/8 to 28 3/4; Pyramid Technology added 3/4
to 21 1/4; Medical Care International rose 1 1/2 to 39 1/4;
Good Guys advanced 3/4 to 21; Software Toolworks gained 1/4
to 11 1/8; HealthCare Compare climbed 1 to 24; Laserscope
rose 1/2 to 25 1/4; Teradata added 1/2 to 21 1/2; Chiron
advanced 5/8 to 38; Vicorp Restaurants gained 1/4 to 23 3/4
and Network Systems rose 1/4 to 9 3/4.
   Shares of health maintenance organizations got a boost
after Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood analyst Bernard McDonagh
repeated "buy" recommendations on United Healthcare and U.S.
HealthCare. United Healthcare jumped 1 3/8 to 18 1/4 and U.S.
Healthcare gained 1 1/8 to 21 1/8. Also higher were FHP
International, which rose 1/4 to 14 3/4, and PacifiCare
Health Systems, which edged up 1/8 to 16 1/8.
   Mr. McDonagh told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report
that the two companies he recommended have the least exposure
among HMOs to fluctuations in Medicare reimbursement. DJPIR
reported that a government news release mailed yesterday to
HMOs explains that 1991 Medicare reimbursement rates will be
an average 1.4% higher than 1990, excluding last year's
one-time increase for catastrophic health care. Mr. McDonagh
said the relatively slim increase isn't a surprise.
   Optical Radiation climbed 1 1/8 to 30 3/4 after the Azusa,
Calif., supplier of devices for eye procedures reported that
profit from continuing operations for the fourth quarter
ended July 28 rose to 58 cents a share from 55 cents a year
earlier.
   Amgen, a biotechnology concern and an OTC leader, jumped 1
1/4 to 46. But Cetus, an Emeryville, Calif., biotech company,
fell 1/4 to 7 1/4 after Erbamont Inc. filed a patent
infringement suit against Cetus.
   CompuChem leaped 1 1/4 to 6 1/2 after the North Carolina
provider of drug testing and other testing services said it
won a five-year drug-testing contract worth $8 million to $10
million from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
   Nu-Med added 7/16 to 3 1/8. Late Friday, HPB Associates
L.P., an investor group with a 9.89% stake in the Encino,
Calif., provider of health care management services, said it
is seeking seats on Nu-Med's board. The group said another
shareholder, Allen Holding Inc., which has a 9.5% stake in
Nu-Med, supports its plan.
   MCI Communications rose 3/8 to 34 1/8. The Australian
government called for a new telecommunications company to
compete with government-owned Telecom. Analysts say MCI is
one of several U.S. telecommunications concerns that might be
interested in taking a stake in a new Australian company.
Separately, MCI announced it won a three-year, $12-million
contract to provide service to Neiman Marcus's U.S. stores.
The Nasdaq Utility Index, of which MCI is the largest stock,
rose 3.71 to 513.58.
   Paychex added 3/4 to 15 3/4 after a two-point rise Friday.
Morgan Stanley analyst L. Keith Mullins told DJPIR that
investors are expecting the Rochester, N.Y., provider of
payroll accounting services will turn in a favorable first
quarter earnings report after a series of disappointing
quarterly earnings announcements.
   Favorable profiles in this week's edition of Barron's
magazine triggered gains in Healthdyne and Mentor.
   Healthdyne, a Marietta, Ga., provider of home-healthcare
services, added 3/8 to 13 1/4. Mentor, a Santa Barbara,
Calif., maker of medical devices gained 5/8 to 17.
   Among the day's losers, First Financial Bancorp plunged 4
1/4 to 33. Late Friday, the Monroe, Ohio, bank holding
company said that it would take a $4.5 million charge against
1990 earnings to cover loan losses at its First National Bank
of Southwestern Ohio. In 1989, First Financial had net income
of $15.2 million, or $3.01 a share.

   An `Organic' Beef

   DENVER -- Tired of waiting for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and Congress to give approval, the nation's
largest marketer of so-called natural beef said it will begin
marketing an organic beef to the public.
   The new beef, however, won't be called "organic" on the
label, a move designed to skirt trouble with the USDA.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mel Coleman, chairman and founder of Coleman Natural Meats
Inc., said his new brand of meat will carry a label that
defines what he thinks "organic" means. The small print on
the label will include: "Our animals never receive
antibiotics or growth hormones from the time they are born. .
. . They receive only feeds produced without herbicides and
pesticides."
   The Coleman Organic Beef name will be used only on
advertising materials -- not on labels -- because the USDA
has yet to approve the use of the word "organic" on labels.
Congress, however, may force the USDA's hand by approving the
use of "organic" and a definition of the word along with the
1990 Farm Bill, which is currently in conference committee.
Both the House and the Senate have passed similar versions of
an amendment that would allow the USDA to approve organic
labeling on consumer foods.
   Mr. Coleman, who lobbied for the bill, said he has
received certification for the product from the Organic Crop
Improvement Association, an international group. He is the
only meat producer to receive the OCIA's certification.
   Coleman Natural Beef will continue to outsell Coleman
Organic Beef, because it is less expensive, Mr. Coleman
predicted. But he currently has more organic beef orders from
retailers than he can fill, he said. The difference between
the organic and natural beef is that the natural beef cattle
may eat feed that isn't certified as organic, Mr. Coleman
said.

   Stock Prices End Mixed as Rumors
   On Mideast Crisis Fuel a Surge in Oil

   NEW YORK -- The stock market, hurt by a rumor-driven surge
in the price of oil, proved unable to hold an early rally and
closed mixed in another quiet session.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped out to an early
gain of more than 30 points, which it held until midafternoon
when rumors of Persian Gulf military activity and a
subsequent surge in oil prices sparked a market sell-off. The
industrial average ended the day with a loss of 3.96 at
2615.59.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The industrial average, falling less sharply than the
broader market indexes, benefited from continued buying of
"defensive growth" issues, stocks of companies expected to
perform well if a Middle East war should break out or the
economy should fall into a recession.
   Among the broader indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index dropped 1.77, or 0.55%, to 321.63; by comparison, the
loss in the Dow Jones industrials amounted to 0.15%. The New
York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.81 to 176.70 and
the Dow Jones Equity Market Index lost 1.49 to 298.14.
   But advancing issues edged decliners by 777 to 739 on the
Big Board, reflecting the broad-based advance that began the
session. Traders attributed the early rally to the impact of
Sunday's summit between President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, an early drop in oil prices and a strong
performance from overseas stock markets.
   In Tokyo, the Nikkei Index of 225 issues soared 1118.83
points to 25080.90, while shares closed higher in all
European stock markets except Zurich, which was closed for a
holiday.
   The post-summit optimism proved short-lived in New York,
however, as rumors surfaced in the afternoon that Iraqi
planes had invaded Saudi Arabian air space. The rumors, which
weren't confirmed, fueled a surge in oil prices that
propelled October crude-oil futures to $31.30, up $1.26, in
New York trading.
   Sell programs resulting from stock-index arbitrage -- the
purchase of index futures and the sale of stocks to lock in
profits from the price differential between the two --
weighed on the market as oil rallied.
   The sluggish trading of the past two weeks continued, with
Big Board volume amounting to 119,730,000 shares, slightly
below Friday's total of 123,800,000 shares.
   "It's a market that's still very fragile," said A.
Marshall Acuff Jr., a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham, adding that the light trading shows a lack of
confidence among investors.
   With the Mideast situation unresolved and other problems
confronting the market -- such as the economy, the federal
budget deficit and high levels of corporate debt -- investors
are adopting a "let someone else be first" attitude toward
stocks, Mr. Acuff said.
   Toys "R" Us went down 1 to 22 1/8 on composite trading of
2.6 million shares and Wal-Mart Stores fell 1 to 27 on 1.4
million shares. Salomon Brothers lowered its investment
ratings on the two retailers, along with its earnings
estimates on several other retailers, to reflect the
potential for softer earnings in a recessionary environment,
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said.
   Energy stocks fell despite the afternoon upturn in oil
prices. Exxon fell 1/2 to 50 3/8, Chevron lost 1 1/4 to 76
3/4, Texaco fell 1 1/8 to 63 3/8, Mobil dropped 1 1/8 to 65
3/8, Unocal lost 7/8 to 32 1/2 and British Petroleum dipped 1
1/2 to 81 5/8; in the oil-services sector, Halliburton eased
1/4 to 54 1/4 and Dresser Industries lost 1 1/8 to 49 3/8.
   Meanwhile, precious-metals stocks tracked a drop in the
price of gold. October gold futures fell $11.10 an ounce to
$380.30 in New York trading. Newmont Mining retreated 1 7/8
to 43 1/8, Coeur d'Alene Mines fell 1 to 26 3/8 and Amax
dropped 3/8 to 14 3/4. Shares in all three companies will be
put up for sale shortly, The Wall Street Journal reported
yesterday in its "Heard on the Street" column, and analysts
think other gold producers could follow suit.
   Gains in overseas stock markets translated into buying
interest in several single-country mutual fund issues. New
Germany Fund rose 5/8 to 11 3/8, Emerging Germany Fund
climbed 5/8 to 8 3/8, Italy Fund went up 3/8 to 11 7/8,
France Growth Fund rose 1/8 to 8 7/8, Mexico Fund added 1/4
to 13 1/4 and Japan OTC Equity Fund rose 1/2 to 9 3/4.
   UAL, which surged 7 7/8 Friday, rose another 2 to 102 1/4.
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Paul Nisbet issued a
report which predicted that the union-led buy-out of United
Airlines' parent company would be consummated by October.
   McDonnell Douglas gained 1 1/8 to 48 3/4 after the Bush
administration and South Korea reached an agreement on the
sale of 120 of its F/A-18 Hornet fighter planes, a contract
valued at $4.7 billion. Separately, McDonnell said it expects
to record a third-quarter gain of about $234 million from the
purchase of an annuity contract, covering benefits to about
14,200 retirees, from Metropolitan Life Insurance.
   United Telecommunications added 5/8 to 25 1/2. PaineWebber
raised its investment rating on the stock to "attractive"
from "neutral" and boosted its 1991 earnings estimate by 15
cents a share, to $2.40.
   Johnson Controls gained 5/8 to 24 after putting its
battery business up for sale. The company said it will
consider selling all or part of the operations.
   TCBY Enterprises rose 5/8 to 7 after boosting its
quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share from three cents.
   Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust tacked on 3/4 to 4 7/8. The trust,
operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, filed a
reorganization plan calling for it to pay creditors in full
and to make dividend payments.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index declined
0.56 to 323.21, reflecting the weakness in oil and gold
issues. Volume totaled 10,600,000 shares.

   TORONTO -- Last week's election victory by Ontario's New
Democratic Party may hurt Canada's chances of solving its
serious budgetary and constitutional problems, but not
because the New Democrats are socialists.
   Pollsters and political operatives widely view the
left-wing party's success as evidence of voter discontent
with the political establishment all over Canada. That's a
boon for third parties such as the NDP and for new regional
parties that want major changes in the country's
constitution.

   "People are fed up. People are willing to look at
something new," said Francois Gerin, one of seven members of
the Canadian Parliament who deserted their national parties
earlier this year to form a parliamentary bloc devoted to
Quebec independence.
   "This sense of disenchantment across the land is something
that any grass-roots protest party can do well from," said
Angus Reid, president of Angus Reid Associates Inc., a
polling concern. He said one of his recent polls found 40% of
the voters in the province of Alberta ready to vote for the
new Reform Party if a provincial election were held. The
three-year-old party wants to change the Canadian
constitution to give the western provinces more power.
   "The great danger is that we'll end up with almost an
Italian-style government, a government devoid of a leader,"
says Douglas Frith, a former federal cabinet minister. "That
would be a government unable to deal with our economic
agenda. By 1993 we'll probably have a national debt of 430
billion (Canadian) dollars (US$369 billion)."
   The New Democrats last week won 74 of the seats in
Ontario's 130-member parliament, which means they will form
the government of the province that accounts for more than
40% of Canada's economy. Although the party has ruled some
smaller provinces in the past, it never has governed Ontario.
   The New Democrats won only 38% of the popular vote, but
anti-establishment ballots amounted to about 44% when a
record-high vote by several fringe-parties is counted. The
ruling Liberals won only 33% of the popular vote. The other
traditional leading party, the Progressive Conservatives, won
about 24%.
   Pollsters say establishment politicians have never been as
mistrusted in Canada. Mr. Reid says Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney gets a 15% approval rating outside Quebec, "the
lowest I've seen in 15 years in this business."
   Much of the public anger stems from failure of the
political parties to reach a new constitutional arrangement
with Quebec early this summer. Mr. Mulroney and all 10
provincial premiers put the public through a long,
cliff-hanging political circus that resulted only in bad
tempers among both French and English Canadians.
   The federal government's inability to balance its budget,
a nationwide civil disobedience campaign by native Indians
and the proposed imposition of a widely unpopular value-added
tax have all added to a sense of governments that are either
powerless or unresponsive to the voters.
   The Ontario Liberals inflamed this sentiment when Liberal
Premier David Peterson called last week's election two years
before he had to, after polls showed his party would get 50%
of the popular vote and, therefore, a big majority in
parliament.
   Voters saw this as cynical manipulation, says Donna Dasko,
vice president of Environics Research Group Ltd., a polling
concern. "It was like he announced he was having a birthday
and invited people to send him presents," she says. Combined
with widespread cynicism about politicians in general, and
Mr. Peterson's prominent role in promoting the failed
agreement with Quebec, Liberal fortunes plunged.
   "How foolish do you think we are, to be taken in by this?"
voters asked Mr. Frith, the former cabinet minister, when he
tried to defend the election date while campaigning
door-to-door for his local Liberal candidate.
   Political observers see that attitude extending far beyond
Ontario and Mr. Peterson's election gaffe. "The Bloc
Quebecois (which seeks independence for Quebec) is just one
group that could benefit in the next election," says Ms.
Dasko. "The Reform Party in the West is very strong and I'd
expect them to do very well if this mood keeps up," she says.
   The splintering of Canadian politics could paralyze
efforts to deal with major issues that require cooperation
between the federal government and all the provinces.
   Quebec soon will come up with its own plan for changing
its relations with the rest of Canada and it's likely to be
less acceptable to English Canadians than the one that
failed. The Western provinces want a major political
reorganization to give themselves more federal power. No
solution to the government deficits is likely without
federal-provincial agreement on spending and tax revenue.
   Canadians currently are furious over government failure to
deal with the problems of native Indians, which have led to
Indian blockades of railroads, roads, bridges and even an
attempt to divert a river so that white farmers won't get
water.
   The blockades and white counter-demonstrations have
shocked Canadians with nightly television images of armed
troops, rioting mobs and Canadian police beating protesters.
"Canadians expect those things to happen in other countries,
and they get pretty unhappy when it's allowed to happen
here," says Bill Fox, a former spokesman for the Mulroney
government.
   Indian land claims can't be solved by any one government
because native rights are a federal responsibility in Canada,
but public lands mostly belong to the provinces. Feeble
governments at either level may make it harder to adopt a
common policy toward this latest crisis too.
