   TORONTO -- Aur Resources Inc. said it agreed to settle a
legal dispute over the ownership of a large copper and zinc
deposit it discovered in northern Quebec.
   The agreement, between Aur, Louvem Mines Inc. and Louvem's
parent, Ste. Genevieve Resources Ltd., gives Aur a 55%
working interest in the Louvicourt deposit. Louvem will hold
45% of the property and will get a payment from Aur of one
million Canadian dollars (U.S.$861,300).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Aur, based in Toronto, will retain the key role of
operator of any mine developed at the deposit, which has been
hailed as one of Canada's biggest base-metal discoveries in
recent years. Louvem and Ste. Genevieve are based in
Montreal.
   The proposed settlement came after a previous agreement
was blocked last month by Noranda Minerals Inc., a unit of
Noranda Inc. that owns 22% of Louvem's shares. Aur said
Noranda, a resources concern based in Toronto, approved the
latest pact, which provides for Noranda to manage Louvem's
interest in the deposit.
   The legal dispute between Aur and Louvem dates back to
April 1989, when Aur filed a suit against Louvem and Ste.
Genevieve, claiming Louvem forfeited a 50% stake in the
Louvicourt property because it failed to make a payment on
exploration expenses. Louvem in turn alleged that Aur
withheld data about the property, and claimed 100% ownership.
Each company denied the other's charges.
   Under the settlement proposal, Noranda has the right of
first refusal to purchase between 50% and 60% of Aur's share
of mine output in the first eight years of production. Louvem
also has agreed to sell its share of metal output from the
property over the life of the mine to Noranda, which owns a
nearby smelting facility.
   The settlement, which is subject to regulatory approval
and other conditions, is expected to be finalized by Sept.
24.

   Oil Companies Expected to Sign Accord
   To Develop Canada's Hibernia Oil Field

<LP>
   OTTAWA -- A group of oil companies led by Mobil Oil Canada
Ltd. is expected to sign an agreement tomorrow to develop the
big Hibernia oil field off Canada's east coast.
   The US$4.4 billion project will be Canada's largest and
most expensive energy development, and industry analysts
predict it will spur further development of Canada's offshore
oil resources.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, the government approved the development of
another smaller oil project off the Canadian east coast.
   Hibernia, discovered more than 10 years ago, is expected
to produce 110,000 barrels of oil a day for 20 years starting
in 1996. Most of the oil is expected to be shipped to
refineries in the U.S. Northeast.
   Hibernia's prospects have brightened as a result of the
Persian Gulf crisis, which has pushed oil prices to their
highest levels in almost 10 years.
   Still, the project has been widely criticized by some
industry analysts who claim it wouldn't be economical without
the heavy financial support of the Canadian and Newfoundland
governments. Both governments are due to sign the Hibernia
development agreement tomorrow.
   The Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney announced that it would contribute $2.3
billion in grants and loan guarantees to the project just
before it called a federal election in November 1988.
   The Newfoundland government, anxious to generate
employment in the province, has agreed to forgo some taxes on
the project.
   "We're bringing onstream probably the most expensive
production in the world," said Ian Doig, editor of Doig's
Digest, an industry newsletter. Mr. Doig estimated that it
will cost almost $33 a barrel to develop Hibernia. He said
about another $1 billion would have to be spent to shut down
the field when its reserves run out. Mr. Doig said the nearby
Terra Nova oil field could be developed at a fraction of
Hibernia's cost.
   Newfoundland Energy Minister Rex Gibbons said Hibernia
would generate "a very quick payback to Canada." He estimated
that Hibernia would be profitable with oil prices as low as
$14 a barrel. At current prices, Hibernia would produce
"significant profits," Mr. Gibbons said. West Texas
Intermediate, a benchmark crude, was quoted yesterday at
$30.95 a barrel.
   Some industry analysts said Hibernia will encourage
development of other east coast oil discoveries including the
Terra Nova and White Rose fields, all off the coast of
Newfoundland province. Only one well is currently being
drilled in the eastern offshore region, but Mr. Gibbons said
the area could produce as much as 200,000 barrels of oil a
day once Hibernia and other fields start production.
   Hibernia's development has been repeatedly delayed because
of low oil prices and jurisdictional disputes between the
Canadian and Newfoundland governments. In recent months,
negotiations between the oil companies and the Canadian and
Newfoundland governments were stalled by disagreements over
where contracts for Hibernia's work will be placed.
   "What should have been the trigger project for a complex
of offshore fields has degenerated into an exercise in
regional politics," said Frank Dabbs, an energy writer, in
Canada's Financial Post newspaper.
   Mobil Oil Canada has a 28.1% stake in Hibernia. Its
partners include Gulf Canada Resources Inc., which is
controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family, with 25%;
government-owned Petro-Canada, 25%; and Chevron Canada
Resources Ltd., a unit of San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.,
21.9%. Mobil Oil Canada is a unit of New York-based Mobil
Corp.
   A government agency approved plans by a Canadian unit of
London &amp; Scottish Marine Oil PLC, or Lasmo, to develop two
oil fields off Nova Scotia province. The fields are due to
start production in 1992, before Hibernia, making them the
first developed oil fields off the North American coast.
   Lasmo Nova Scotia Ltd. and its partner Nova Scotia
Resources (Ventures) Ltd., a provincial government agency,
plan to recover 35 million barrels of light oil from the two
fields over six years. The fields, known as Cohasset and
Panuke, are expected to cost $134 million dollars to develop.
   The fields contain a high-grade condensate that can be
used to make jet fuel and can be blended with heavier crudes.
   Petro-Canada is expected to submit to government
regulators this year its plans to develop the Terra Nova
field. The field is expected to contain 300 million barrels
of crude and production is expected to begin in the
mid-1990s. Terra Nova's development is expected to cost about
$1.7 billion.

   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon, in a legal settlement with an
association representing U.S. defense workers, agreed to
limit its right to purchase defense equipment and services
abroad.
   The settlement, signed in federal district court here,
acknowledges that the Pentagon's reciprocal trade accords
with various allied countries don't constitute a "blanket
waiver" of most "buy-American" rules favoring U.S. defense
suppliers. The exceptions are the Buy American Act of 1933
and a program relating to the logistical needs of overseas
U.S. bases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With the defense business now declining nearly everywhere,
U.S. defense workers are demanding stricter observance of the
buy-American laws. The Pentagon buys more than $20 billion
from overseas suppliers annually, the council estimates.
   Jerome Zeifman, counsel for the National Council for
Industrial Defense, said the settlement will make it more
difficult for the Pentagon to go overseas for such items as
research on the "Star Wars" missile-defense program,
supercomputers, certain machine tools, aviation and shipping,
ship repairs, food, and clothing.
   "This is a settlement without prejudice, which means that
we can reinstitute our suit any time we feel that the
Pentagon isn't living up to its agreement," the lawyer said.
   The council filed suit on behalf of the American
Engineering Association, the AFL-CIO, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and other members. Many of
the trade accords affected were signed in the 1980s, when the
U.S. ran large surpluses in defense-related trade and had to
accommodate its allies' demands for more reciprocity.
   The Pentagon, saying the council's suit arose from a
"misunderstanding," characterized the settlement as a
clarification of what has been a legally correct policy all
along. "We've never improperly waived the buy-American
statutes," and the settlement is worded to that effect, said
Robert Gorman, a Pentagon attorney.

   Thursday, Sept. 13, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "48 Hours:
Murder, U.S.A." A graphic special edition on our murder rate,
now high enough for the U.S. to claim honors as the homicide
capital of the world. The evidence Dan Rather and company
have gathered in support of this thesis is both grisly and
convincing, if not exactly news to most people. Some of the
closeups are fairly gory, others notable for other reasons,
such as the scenes in which the art of loading and shooting a
gun is taught to an enthusiastic band of middle American
wives and mothers, one of whom announces -- and who can doubt
her? -- that this is better than housework.

   Thursday, Sept. 13, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "Gabriel's
Fire" is more like a sputter in danger of dying thanks to the
extreme windiness of its script, about a virtuous former
convict who teams up with an equally sanctimonious female
defense attorney. The high oratory here is such that even the
estimable James Earl Jones (Gabriel) may be unable to effect
a rescue.
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, Sept. 18, 9-11, on PBS (PBS air dates and times
vary so check local listings): "Frontline: The Decade of
Destruction," the beginning of a four-part series on the
decimation of the Amazon rain forest. Offered free land in
exchange for homesteading, Brazilian migrants slashed and
burned their way through the primeval trees in order to clear
farmland that soon lost its power to grow crops. It is a
seductively narrated story mingling themes of pursuit,
revenge and an eerily evocative war between settlers and
Indians, except that this isn't a Western, and the Indians
padding around with bows and arrows are not members of the
Screen Actors Guild. If only for the pictures the two hours
spent watching this would be well spent. (Parts two, three
and four air Wednesday-Friday, 10-11 p.m.)
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Sept. 19, 8-8:30 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Lenny," one
of the season's better new sitcoms. This is about a
blue-collar sort, portrayed with wry vigor by comedian Lenny
Clarke. The real find here though is Lee Garlington, who
gives a clever, nuanced performance as Lenny's wife-no easy
thing in a script evidently determined to obey this season's
fashion, which dictates at least a sprinkling of coarseness.
The last line's gratuitous vulgarity makes that determination
clear. Scriptwriters capable of imagining a line like it for
an ending are capable of any perfidy. This caveat aside, the
rest of "Lenny" shows a warmth and sparkle that ought to win
audiences.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Sept. 19, 8-9:30 p.m., on PBS: "Adlai
Stevenson: The Man From Libertyville." In 1952, for those not
around at the time, Illinois Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson ran for
president against Dwight Eisenhower, former supreme allied
commander in the European theater of operations, and
Stevenson lost -- badly -- as he would do again four years
later. That should have been the end of the story, but
Americans, including the notables who appear in this film,
knew Stevenson would never be just another failed candidate.
He was a legend, enshrined as few also-rans have ever been,
so it is not surprising that all these decades later we have
this TV biography, reverentially narrated by Gregory Peck.
Can you imagine this sort of emotional memorialization being
offered 38 years from now about, say, George McGovern? Lauren
Bacall is here too, still looking starry-eyed as she talks
about Stevenson. A lot of Americans like her were in love
with him -- there is no other word for it -- in a serious
way, and this film, with its clips of that piercing smile,
that voice with its stately, but humor-drenched cadences,
will make them remember why. Many more citizens, of course,
loved Eisenhower, but what Stevenson's admirers felt was a
passion of a different order. He elevated politics with his
wit and eloquence, and no one who saw him so would forget
him. In addition to all this, for many people, this surely be
the only chance in their lifetimes to behold a candidate who
actually had to be drafted, pushed and shoved, before he
would accept the presidential nomination -- at least the
first time.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Sept. 23, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "The Queen of
Mean," is the monarch of the Helmsley hotel chain, Leona
Helmsley, famed, among other unfortunate utterances, for her
alleged observation that "only little people pay taxes." Try
as she will, Suzanne Pleshette just does not have the
coarseness to make a true hotel queen. Lloyd Bridges, who
admittedly has a rather easier job of it, is on the other
hand splendid as the silent Harry, a weary old man who once
was a veritable Fred Astaire on the dance floor, as we see
here. Mawkish in its psychologizing and also in a lot of
other ways, "Leona" still is indisputably entertaining,
especially if you like a little embarrassment with your
movies.

   Draws Criticism
   On Student Loans

   WASHINGTON -- Government investigators accused the
Education Department of significant shortcomings in its
management of the guaranteed student-loan program, which is
plagued by defaults of more than $2 billion annually.
   James Thomas, the department's inspector general, said the
government's approach for policing schools that participate
in the loan program "is all too often a paper chase." In
testimony before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, he said that the department's "accrediting,
eligibility and certification system is not effective in
protecting federal funds from misuse or in protecting
students."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, a report by the subcommittee's staff accused
the Education Department of "serious shortcomings in the
current oversight system," particularly as it applies to
proprietary schools, which train people for such jobs as
hairdressers and truck drivers. Trade schools generally have
the highest loan-default rates. The staff charged that the
department certified schools "even when they have clear
indicators of administrative deficiencies."
   Last year, the department announced a new initiative to
discipline or close schools with high loan-default rates. And
earlier this week, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos
announced steps designed to force the agencies that accredit
schools to do a better job.
   Yesterday's hearing was the latest in a series of
congressional inquiries following the July disclosure that
the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, which has
guaranteed some $9 billion in student loans, is on the brink
of collapse because too many of its loans are in default. The
administration currently is reviewing proposals from United
Student Aid Funds, another guarantee agency, and the Student
Loan Marketing Association to take over HEAF's portfolio. A
decision is expected later this month.
   Under the federal loan-guarantee program, students who
attend accredited schools are eligible to apply for loans.
The government doesn't accredit schools directly. Instead, it
relies on about 100 accreditation agencies which, in turn,
are subject to Education Department review. In addition, the
department must certify that the schools are properly
accredited. The investigators charged that the department was
too lax in both procedures.
   In an effort to tighten procedures, Mr. Cavazos said the
department plans to review the activities of agencies that
have accredited schools that have unusually high default
rates. According to 1988 data released by the subcommittee
staff, students at about 70 of some 8,400 accredited schools
accounted for half of the default volume. And all of these 70
schools were accredited by only seven of the about 100
accrediting agencies.
   One of the reasons HEAF got into trouble was that it
guaranteed a large volume of loans to students at proprietary
schools, many with high default rates. Tommy Downs, who left
a prison where he was sentenced for defrauding the
student-loan program to testify before the panel, called HEAF
"a school owner's dream and a source of almost instant money.
. . . Almost anyone could get a loan through HEAF if they
could figure out how to fill in the blanks on its
computerized forms and deal with its easy-to-satisfy,
Kelly-girl-type administrative personnel."
   However, Mr. Downs conceded, it was a secretary who
discovered that a proprietary school he ran was illegally
collecting money from the government by submitting loan
applications for nonexistent students and triggered the
investigation that sent him to prison.
   Richard Hawk, the chairman of HEAF, said that Mr. Downs's
criminal conviction "was in large part the result of the
diligent efforts of HEAF personnel. . . . We regret that an
unscrupulous trade school representative convicted of student
loan fraud knowingly took advantage of HEAF's efficient and
effective service in abusing the student loan program."

   Alzheimer's Is a Group of Disorders,
   Not a Single Disease, Researchers Say

   BOSTON -- Researchers here reported that different cases
of Alzheimer's disease can spring from different causes,
showing that it is a group of closely associated disorders
rather than a single illness.
   The finding complicates the search for the causes of
Alzheimer's disease. But by providing new clues in that
search, it promises to accelerate efforts to understand how
the disease develops, and, perhaps someday, how to ward it
off.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Studies on the disease, which usually affects people over
age 60, are increasingly urgent as the population grows
older. It is the nation's fourth leading killer; an estimated
four million Americans suffer from it, experiencing
progressive memory loss and loss of other mental powers.
   Scientists have long suspected that there are different
forms of Alzheimer's disease, which develop in different
ways, but which all lead to the same kind of brain
deterioration. But strong evidence of that hypothesis was
lacking before now, says Peter H. St. George-Hyslop, a
Massachusetts General Hospital researcher who led a 60-person
international team that made the latest discovery.
   "This is the first {report of} pretty clear-cut evidence"
that Alzheimer's disease represents "multiple disorders"
rather than a single disease with one cause, he added.
   In 1987, a group of researchers, including Dr. St.
George-Hyslop, showed that a gene associated with a
relatively rare, inherited form of the disease -- called
familial Alzheimer's disease, or FAD -- resides on chromosome
21, one of the 23 pairs of coiled DNA that carry genetic
material in human cells. Since then, scientists have been
trying to pinpoint the gene.
   The latest discovery, published in today's issue of the
journal Nature, showed that "late-onset" cases of FAD, whose
effects appear after age 65, stem from a cause, or causes,
other than a gene on chromosome 21. That cause may be another
genetic defect. Alternatively, it could involve a nongenetic
factor. Scientists have theorized that viruses, or certain
chemicals, could trigger the disease, perhaps in people with
a genetic predisposition to it. In any case, researchers now
are broadening their studies to look for different genes and
non-genetic factors underlying Alzheimer's disease, Dr. St.
George-Hyslop said.
   One of the hottest new leads involves chromosome 19. In
May, researchers at Duke University Medical Center reported
they had found evidence that a gene on chromosome 19 is
associated with common, late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The
Duke team also reported that it had found evidence supporting
the earlier discovery that a gene on chromosome 21 underlies
the inherited "early onset" form of Alzheimer's disease,
which strikes before age 65. The Duke scientists, however,
haven't published details of their findings in a scientific
journal, and the findings haven't yet been confirmed by other
researchers.
   Some scientists now believe that all cases of Alzheimer's
disease are caused directly by genes, or by a genetic
predisposition, that makes people vulnerable to suspected
external triggers. According to one variation of the theory,
everyone carries genes that cause Alzheimer's disease, and
all people would get the illness if they lived long enough.

   Democrats, Republicans Differ Sharply
   In Their Depictions of the Thrift Debacle

   WASHINGTON -- First, Rep. Lynn Martin (R., Ill.) attacked
her opponent, incumbent Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.), for a
phone call he made to a savings and loan association on
behalf of a Simon supporter and Chicago real estate agent who
defaulted on a $5 million loan. "You'd think a U.S. senator
would have shown better judgment," said a Martin commercial.
   Next came the counterattack. The Simon campaign aired a TV
spot asserting that then-Rep. Simon was one of 13 members of
Congress to vote against the first major deregulation bill.
"Lynn Martin consistently favored deregulation of S&amp;Ls,"
charged the Simon ad.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The difference in these two approaches to the S&amp;L issue
clearly reflects the particular circumstances of each
candidate. But it also underscores a larger point: As the two
parties begin to refine their messages on the thrift debacle,
they are starting to present two sharply different pictures
of the crisis.
   For Democrats, the S&amp;L collapse is a national issue that
discredits 10 years of Republican-inspired economic
deregulation. "George Bush, Ronald Reagan and their
high-roller friends ran the government, designed the S&amp;L
policy, and hand-picked the people that gutted the oversight
agencies," charges the Democratic National Committee's "Guide
for Understanding the S&amp;L Crisis," sent out last month to
Democratic members of Congress.
   Republicans, however, define the issue less sweepingly as
the result of the corruption or ineptitude of individual
politicians, many of them Democratic. A recent paper by the
House Republican Conference concedes that the Reagan
administration erred in hiring too few bank examiners and not
paying them enough, but stresses that the chief villains were
key lawmakers who "stall, strut, posture, hold their nose,
clip wires on the smoke-detectors, and throw rocks at the
firemen."
   Such opposing views reflect the two parties' different
strategies in dealing with the thrift crisis, which is
expected to cost the federal government $130 billion,
excluding interest. Democrats, who must wait until 1992
before they can use the S&amp;L issue against President Bush,
have substituted his son Neil as a symbol of the thrift mess.
Although the furor over Neil Bush's role as a director of the
Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association has subsided,
conflict-of-interest charges concerning Mr. Bush will get a
fresh airing at an administrative hearing in Denver later
this month.
   Republicans, meanwhile, are vigorously publicizing
connections between the S&amp;L industry and individual members
of Congress like Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.), whose two
sons-in-law were recently revealed to have former ties to the
U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   Nowhere is the difference between the two parties' stances
more apparent than in the DNC and House Republican Conference
papers issued last month. The Democratic document charges
that the thrift mess "was created by deliberate cutbacks in
the supervision of the S&amp;L industry under Republican economic
philosophy, in a Republican era, under two successive
Republican administrations." The Republican report, on the
other hand, states that the S&amp;L crisis was created in the
early 1980s by "a bipartisan cast of politicians," and argues
that the involvement of Democrats in creating the problem
makes "Democratic willingness to make S&amp;L salvage management
an issue in 1990" seem "strange."
   Thus far, the differences in party strategies haven't had
a major impact on the campaign trail. Where the opportunity
presents itself, Democrats seem just as eager as Republicans
to attack their opponents' individual records on S&amp;Ls --
especially when the opponent has accepted contributions from
the thrift industry.
   Even where the differences do surface, drawing a partisan
line can be difficult for Democrats. For example, Sen.
Simon's TV ad doesn't explicitly label deregulation as a
Republican policy, and for good reason: That first vote he
cast against deregulation occurred in 1980, when Jimmy Carter
was president.
   Still, congressional Democrats are working to keep
Republican culpability in the headlines through a number of
hearings on the S&amp;L crisis scheduled for this month. Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) on Tuesday concluded a series of
hearings on James Fail, a Texas thrift executive who retained
a former Bush aide to lobby on his behalf. And Sen. David
Pryor (D., Ark.) is planning to investigate the
administration of the S&amp;L bailout itself -- which is
unambiguously the responsibility of the Bush administration.
   Now there are signs that Democratic challengers are
beginning to heed the message spelled out in the DNC playbook
-- if not to attack Republicans, at least to attack
Washington. "The S&amp;L scandal is costing us billions and the
budget deficit is skyrocketing and all politicians in
Washington can think of is to make us pay for the mess,"
charges an ad for Democrat Harry Lonsdale, who's challenging
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.).
   Another ad, for challenger Ted Muenster, a Democrat
seeking to unseat Sen. Larry Pressler (R., S.D.), states that
"the politicians are spending more time blaming each other
for the savings and loan mess than trying to get our money
back."
   Still, both parties have far to go in articulating their
messages. "For Democrats, it ought to be a policy debate over
deregulation," says political scientist William Schneider of
the American Enterprise Institute. "The Republican
argument,"he says, "is essentially that it's a congressional
failure." But so far, "it's the politics of character
assassination. It's just another device for negative
campaigning."

   ROCKY HILL, Conn. -- Ames Department Stores Inc. reported
a second-quarter net loss of $152.5 million, or $4.15 a
share, but said that operating losses weren't as bad as it
had expected.
   The discount retailer, which is operating under Chapter 11
protection of the federal Bankruptcy Code, said the loss
widened from a restated loss of $11.1 million, or 38 cents a
share, in the year-ago quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stephen L. Pistner, who took over as Ames chief executive
officer in May after the bankruptcy-law filing, said the
company's losses before nonrecurring charges were
"significantly less than we expected because of
better-than-expected summer clearance sales."
   Ames said that before the nonrecurring charges, its
operating loss was $79.4 million. Nonrecurring charges
include a $40 million adjustment of accounts payable during
the bankruptcy claims filing process, a $20 million reserve
for inventory markdowns and a $9.1 million write-off of
certain management information systems.
   Ames sales declined 54% to $563.3 million from $1.22
billion.
   Ames started racking up big losses last year after
acquiring the Zayre discount store chain in an ambitious
expansion attempt. Many of the Zayre stores proved to be
money-losers, and Ames closed 221 of them in June.
   Mr. Pistner said that during the quarter Ames "essentially
restarted the business," getting suppliers to start shipping
merchandise again and resuming advertising.
   For the six months, Ames net loss widened to $583.4
million, or $15.71 a share, from $27.5 million, or 90 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales fell 33% to $1.55 billion from
$2.33 billion.

   Drivel From the Donald

   When the books editor of The Wall Street Journal phoned
me, I told my girl to put the call right through. The Journal
is a truly world-class institution for which I have enormous
respect. Besides, the newspaper business, in which the
Journal team is a major player, is an industry in which I've
always been fascinated. I'm not saying I was panting. People
who make deals do not pant. But I was willing to talk.
   "Andrew," this editor said to me, "you must review that
Trump book." Frankly, I was not surprised to hear from her.
She happens to be one of the top editors in her chosen field
and a major, major talent. We had done numerous deals over
the past two years and, to be honest, I think even my critics
will admit that we both benefited in a maximized way from
those deals. My work filled the upper righthand corner of
this page, which I happen to know is a very sensitive matter
with this particular editor, and I walked away with more than
a few dollars in my pocket, which I was very happy to have.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So to myself I'm thinking: This could be class. This could
be a go. I would not be truly unhappy to possess this book,
although I knew that the smirking cover photo might keep my
wife, who is terrific, awake nights. To be in a reviewing
situation with this man's book could be a fantastic
opportunity. But I had doubts of which I had to unburden
myself. That's who I am. That's me.
   "Look," I said to this editor, who is brilliant and back
with whom I go way, "there's one problem. The book stinks. It
is a menace. Spend 25 minutes with it, and you find yourself
thinking and talking exactly the way this man thinks and
talks: self-congratulatory, dissembling, superficial, and
periphrastic, which is a word I happen to know of which the
Donald has never heard. I will not take the risk of sounding
like a buffoon for the rest of my life. I cannot review this
book."
   "I'll pay you extra," she said.
   The book arrived the next day, and my modesty will not be
offended if I admit to you that I was right on target:
"Surviving at the Top" (Random House, 236 pages, $21.95) is
the thinnest, least interesting celebrity book since the
publication of the 18th rewrite of Bob Hope's memoirs, which
is nothing against Bob, who is a dear friend and very old.
   Like innumerable Americans, literally, I had been gagging
for months reading about Donald's incredibly sleazy personal
problems and then had recoiled at the transparently phony
denials of his massive business failures. You would think
that we, as a nation, would have had enough of a man who
induced a coast-to-coast upchuck for the better part of a
year. But you would be wrong. "Surviving at the Top" has
attained an incredibly high position on some of the most
widely respected best-seller lists in this country. Who, you
ask me, is buying this book in such fabulous numbers?
   First are the people who are in an obsessive relationship
with the Donald's personal situation. They are, as he puts
it, the scum of the earth, which in all fairness they have
every right to be. Unfortunately, "Surviving at the Top" is
totally lacking in personal information of the tabloid
variety; if it's gossip you want, I respectfully suggest that
you try Liz Smith, a true pro of whom I am most fond. Ivana
is one very special lady -- brains and body, the Donald
admits. But here's the bottom line on this class act whom he
was proud to call wife before she started monthly skin-peels:
"We seem to be headed in different directions."
   Donald, you're saying, we knew that. You're saying: Fine,
okay, then how about Marla? A "terrific person," Donald
writes, "but my relationship with her was not the cause of
the trouble between Ivana and me." That's it. Now, Marla is
not a nothing lady. This is a lady who has worked in film;
this is a lady who on numerous occasions has expressed deep
concern about our environment; this is a lady who, in a
famous TV interview, achieved the unimaginable feat of making
Diane Sawyer appear intelligent by comparison. But of all
this the Donald says nothing]
   Let us just say that this is a very savvy gentleman, a guy
who plays his cards incredibly close to the vest. This is
also a guy who has happened to achieve at a very high strata
a kind of success that is fabulous. That's why most of his
book is aimed at the readers who are stupid -- although I
respect them totally as people. These are people whose hunger
for business books is insatiable. They are convinced that
"Surviving at the Top" will unlock the secrets of success,
Trump-style -- that it will explain how a man can botch his
deals to the point where his debts exceed his assets by
one-third of a billion dollars and still write a book called
"Surviving at the Top."
   The answer is simple. First, convince scores of terrific
bankers from some of the hugest banks in the world to lend
you very substantial sums of financing. These sums allow you
to spend megalomaniacally, which helps you convince other
brilliantly creative bankers to act in an accommodating mode
when it comes time to pay off the first terrific bankers.
   Do either the Donald or I have to draw you pictures to
explain that those terrific people will therefore do
everything in their power to keep you from going down that
chute? Suddenly you will find that these are some fabulously
patient lenders with whom you are privileged to be doing
business.
   It will be tough. It will be a challenge. But in the final
analysis it will be a deal.

   Is Change Brewing in Auto-Labor Talks?

   Some Executives Grumble
   About `Pattern' Bargaining

   DETROIT -- When General Motors Corp. and the United Auto
Workers union sign a new three-year labor agreement, workers
at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. will know almost line
for line what their new contract will say.
   That's how pattern bargaining works at the Big Three auto
companies, and has worked for nearly 60 years. But after
decades of going along with the UAW's demands for equivalent
pay and working conditions, some Big Three executives are
grumbling that pattern bargaining is hobbling them in
competition with Japanese auto makers. And they argue that
the UAW, itself, is undermining the pattern bargaining system
by granting more favorable terms to Japanese-run factories it
represents, and failing to organize other, non-union Japanese
factories.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There is no pattern," declares Chrysler Chairman Lee A.
Iacocca. "We better face up to reality." He says Chrysler
needs a break from the Big Three pattern to stay competitive
with Japanese-run factories whose labor costs are $8 to $12
an hour per worker lower than the range of $31 to $34 an hour
that the Big Three pattern allows.
   UAW leaders don't see it that way, and say they'll fight
Chrysler's efforts to break out of the Big Three pattern this
fall. "This round of bargaining is on pattern and that's the
way it's going to stay," declares UAW President Owen Bieber.
That means the UAW expects the agreement being negotiated at
GM headquarters in Detroit this week will dictate pay and
working conditions at Chrysler and Ford, too.
   But Mr. Bieber's rhetoric can't change the problems the
UAW faces as the U.S. industry undergoes an historic transfer
of power. About 80,000 auto workers in the U.S. now labor for
Japanese companies, estimates Sean McAlinden, a labor
economist at the University of Michigan. As Japanese
companies have expanded, the Big Three have eliminated some
70,000 UAW positions in the past three years alone.
   Some labor experts say this shift illustrates why the UAW
is fighting a losing battle on the pattern issue.
   In other American industries hard hit by Japanese
competition, such as steel and rubber, "we've seen an end to
pattern bargaining," says William N. Cook, a professor of
labor relations at the University of Michigan. "In the future
that may happen in the auto industry."
   In fact, the auto industry pattern is fractured already.
   For starters, there are now five Japanese-owned auto
factories in the U.S. that aren't unionized at all. Just a
decade ago, all major U.S. auto plants were Big Three union
shops. So far, the UAW has failed to organize a Japanese auto
factory where management has opposed representation. The most
recent defeat came last year at Nissan Motor Corp.'s Smyrna,
Tenn., operation.
   Moreover, the UAW is sanctioning different patterns in
auto operations it represents. There's the traditional Big
Three pattern, characterized by multiple job classifications,
generous health and pension benefits, and large union
bureaucracies to enforce contract terms. Under this pattern,
hourly wages are virtually the same at all three companies:
Ford assembly workers make $15.75 an hour, compared with
$15.74 and $15.73 at GM and Chrysler, respectively.
   But there's a different pattern embodied in recent UAW
contracts with U.S. joint-venture factories run by Mazda
Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp., and Toyota Motor Corp.
These agreements feature just two or three job
classifications, allow more flexibility for management and
provide substantially lower labor costs.
   At the Mitsubishi-Chrysler joint venture plant, the UAW
contract allows the operation to run with the lowest staffing
level of any U.S. car assembly plant. Visitors to the
cavernous factory, built on what was a cornfield near
Bloomington, Ill., can walk the distance of a city block in
some places and find almost no workers.
   Perhaps the most glaring variation from pattern the union
has sanctioned is GM's Saturn division operations in Spring
Hill, Tenn. There, workers are paid a salary, 20% of which
depends on how successful the company is.
   The UAW and pattern bargaining aren't to blame for all of
the Big Three's troubles. Consumers who buy Japanese cars
usually do so because they see in those vehicles better
value, more features or higher quality, all factors that
relate to pricing and design decisions controlled by
management.
   But uncompetitive labor costs are a major reason why GM
and Chrysler since 1987 have closed, or plan to close, a
total of nine UAW-represented assembly plants and several
other parts facilities.
   Supporters of the UAW's stand on pattern bargaining say
it's only fair that pay and benefits be uniform across the
industry.
   "Labor costs should not be the basis of competition," says
Irving Bluestone, a former UAW vice president who now studies
labor at Wayne State University in Detroit.
   But labor costs are a key competitive issue even within
the Big Three pattern system because of the vast differences
among the companies. Three years ago, for example, Ford set
the Big Three pattern and used the opportunity to agree to
job-security language it hoped would undermine GM's efforts
to cut its bloated payrolls.
   This year, GM is the target and is expected to seek terms
that will encourage workers to retire. That will help GM get
leaner, but it could hurt Ford.
   Consider GM's plant in Lake Orion, Mich., 15 miles north
of Detroit, where it employs 5,500 workers who build Cadillac
and Oldsmobile luxury cars. Ford operates a similar plant in
Wixom, Mich., 30 miles southwest of there, which also builds
big, luxury cars. But Ford's plant has only 3,300 workers. A
contract tailored to help GM reduce staffing levels at Orion
could mean higher pension costs for Ford and a scramble to
hire new workers at Wixom.
   "GM comes out a winner, because the union is taking away
Ford's advantage," says Wendy Needham, an analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The big loser in all this could be Chrysler. It's likely
that the union won't kick bargaining into high gear with the
struggling No. 3 auto maker until after it settles with GM
and Ford.
   Currently, Chrysler is asking for concessions from the
UAW, and says it needs to cut operating expenses by $2.5
billion annually in the face of sharply lower sales and
market share. A rich contract at GM and Ford could undercut
those plans.
   "I don't think Ford or GM care whether Chrysler continues
in competition with them," asserts Anthony P. St. John,
Chrysler's vice president for employee relations. "They have
enough competition."
   A decade ago, when Chrysler almost went bankrupt, the UAW
agreed to concessions as part of a $4 billion bailout of the
ailing auto maker. But the UAW isn't in the mood for
concessions these days. Workers at Chrysler's engine plant in
Kenosha, Wis., say they will not approve any settlement
unless it follows the pattern of what GM and Ford workers
get. To make their views clear, many of them have taken to
wearing buttons that say, "Pattern or picket."

<LP>
   Makers of paper products from grocery sacks to disposable
diapers are marketing their goods with claims that they are
environmentally superior to plastic.
   But paper companies may soon find themselves in trouble
with federal regulators for making much the same false or
misleading claims as their rivals in the plastic industry.
Already, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating a
proliferation of environmental claims for various paper
products, and several state officials say they also are
concerned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The main point of contention is paper makers' statements
that their products are biodegradable. Among the companies
making such claims are Stone Container Corp., which says its
paper bags are "naturally degradable" and "environmentally
responsible"; Burger King Corp., which labels all its
fast-food packaging as biodegradable; and Weyerhaeuser Co.,
which makes the same claim for its Nature's Care disposable
diapers.
   These companies say their claims are accurate and confer
an important marketing advantage because the public believes
that paper is "natural" and, therefore, safer for the planet.
But federal and state officials say such claims may only
foster misperceptions about the differences between paper and
plastic.
   "A lot of the claims made for degradable plastic are just
as misleading when applied to paper products," says Barry
Cutler, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of
Consumer Protection.
   The FTC is investigating claims for a variety of paper
products, Mr. Cutler says. The agency's rules preclude the
agency from disclosing specific investigations before it
announces charges. But Stone Container says the FTC has asked
for documentation of claims made in a 30-second TV spot that
ran in some markets earlier this year. In the ad, which the
company says was a test campaign that is now being evaluated,
Stone said its bags are degradable and recyclable.
   The ad was "very effective. More people were asking for
paper bags," a Stone Container spokesman says.
   Environmental groups say degradability claims are
irrelevant, given that nearly 90% of waste is disposed of in
landfills or incinerators. "In a landfill environment, paper
is no more degradable than plastic," says Richard Denison,
senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a
Washington, D.C., advocacy group.
   Supermarket chains and bag makers are also widely
promoting paper grocery sacks as "100% recyclable." But
environmental groups say even that claim tends to mislead
because only 10% to 15% of paper bags are currently being
recycled, according to Franklin Associates Ltd., a Prairie
Village, Kan., solid-waste consultant. (Franklin says that
rate far exceeds the 1% to 3% estimate for plastic bags.)
   Advertising watchdogs are pursuing paper makers partly
because of loud complaints that the plastics industry has
been singled out for attack while claims for paper go
unchallenged. "We're asking for a level playing field," says
George Makrauer, chairman of the Degradable Plastics Council,
an industry group.
   So far, federal and state investigations have targeted
degradability claims for plastic products, such as First
Brands Corp.'s Glad trash bags. Attorneys general in seven
states have sued Mobil Corp.'s Mobil Chemical Co. unit for
alleged false advertising of Hefty trash bags. Bowing to
public pressure, Mobil is removing all environmental claims,
and First Brands is modifying its claims.
   Much is at stake in the paper-plastic marketing war. In 10
years, plastic has won about half the market for grocery
sacks and sales of about $330 million a year, according to
industry estimates. Paper grocery bags, with annual sales of
$1.2 billion, have steadily lost market share as supermarkets
have pushed plastic bags, which cost less than half as much.
   The paper industry has fought back with a media campaign
asserting that "paper bags degrade quickly and harmlessly in
the environment," and urging consumers to demand: "Package
Mine In Paper, Please." The campaign has halted the decline
of paper sacks, both sides say. Mr. Makrauer of the plastics
council says plastic bag sales have dropped 10% to 15% in the
past year.
   The paper industry now is taking the offensive, launching
new products in markets dominated by plastic. Stone
Container, a Chicago company that has 40% of the paper
grocery sack market, recently began selling paper lawn and
trash bags that it says are "all natural" and
"biodegradable." Its new line of trash compactor bags have a
plastic lining wrapped in "environmentally safe" paper.
   The Stone Container spokesman says the claims are accurate
because tests show paper "degrades completely" in water and
when composted. "We'll be the first to admit that nothing
degrades in landfills," he says.
   But Mr. Denison of the Environmental Defense Fund says the
labels are "totally misleading." The lawn and refuse bags are
intended for composting, but the label also specifies
"general trash," which would be burned or dumped in
landfills.
   The marketing battle isn't limited to bags. Keyes Fibre
Co. is increasing the prominence of "100% biodegradable"
labels on Chinet paper plates because many people "thought
they were plastic," says a spokesman. Weyerhaeuser launched
its "88% biodegradable" disposable diapers at the request of
retailers clamoring for an environmentally friendly product.
   Some bag makers and grocery chains are fighting
degradability claims and pushing recycling to keep trash out
of landfills.
   Duro Bag Manufacturing Co. in Ludlow, Ky., sells "100%
recycled" grocery sacks made from used corrugated boxes. Stop
&amp; Shop Supermarket Co., based in Quincy, Mass., is
distributing fliers telling consumers that degradability
isn't the answer. The chain is testing a new Stone Container
sack containing 20% recycled newspapers, but is also
defending its heavy use of plastic bags. Says a spokeswoman:
"We can't determine based on good science that paper or
plastic is superior."

   Japanese Surplus
   In Trade Increased
   3.7% Last Month

   TOKYO -- Japan's trade surplus for August edged up 3.7%,
as another sharp increase in the surplus with Southeast Asia
offset continued narrowing of surpluses with the U.S. and
European Community.
   The August figures, however, don't reflect the recent jump
in crude-oil prices, the full effect of which isn't likely to
show up before October, Finance Ministry officials said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Finance Ministry said the overall surplus, measured on
a customs-cleared basis, rose to $3.49 billion from $3.37
billion a year earlier.
   Exports rose 2.6%, to $22.39 billion from $21.82 billion,
representing the third consecutive increase after eight
consecutive monthly declines. Imports edged up 2.4%, to $18.9
billion from $18.46 billion, led by a 23% jump in imports
from the EC.
   Adjusted for seasonal factors, the August surplus was
$4.74 billion, little changed from the $4.76 billion surplus
in July.
   While some economists had been predicting a renewed
widening of Japan's surplus in the second half of this year,
the recent surge in oil prices makes it increasingly unlikely
that any sharp increase will materialize.
   The rise in spot oil prices, to around $30 a barrel from
less than $20 a barrel before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
could eventually add several hundred million dollars a month
to Japan's import bill. But the dollar value of oil imports
actually slipped 0.5%, to $1.86 billion in August. Finance
Ministry officials explained that it normally takes about two
months for oil-price increases to show up in import
statistics.
   Higher oil prices also are likely to sap demand in Japan's
major export markets, economists note.
   The modest August increase "confirms there will be no
major recovery in Japanese exports this year -- and you have
the oil whammy" adding to the import bill, said Paul
Summerville, senior economist at Jardine Fleming Japan Ltd.
Japan's balance of payments surpluses are likely to run below
many economists' predictions, he said.
   Japan's surplus with the U.S. declined 6% from a year
earlier, to $2.83 billion. Imports declined 1.3% to $4.27
billion. But that was outweighed by a 3.2% drop in exports,
to $7.1 billion.
   A softening U.S. economy contributed to shrinkage in
exports of such items as video equipment and
telecommunications equipment, Finance Ministry officials
said. The main factor in the lower imports was a 71% drop in
imports of aircraft, to $91.7 million.
   Trade with the rest of Asia continued to boom, however.
Japan's surplus with Southeast Asia and South Korea jumped
75%, to $1.57 billion, as exports of autos, video equipment,
engines and other machinery remained strong. Imports from the
region declined 3.4%, to $5.48 billion. But Mr. Summerville
said imports from the region could pick up if higher oil
prices eat into local demand. Such a development could cause
Southeast Asian producers to redirect output from local
markets to Japan, he said.
   The surplus with the EC fell 16%, to $1.13 billion. The
23% jump in imports from the EC came as European producers of
alcoholic beverages, autos and art works continued to find an
increased appetite for their goods among Japanese consumers.

   Film: A Big Party for Meryl and Mike

   Watching Meryl Streep impersonate Carrie Fisher's
fictionalized version of herself as a drugged-out Beverly
Hills brat is a bit like watching a grand diva put all she's
got into "My Boy Lollipop." You don't know which is made to
seem more ridiculous: the performer, for investing far too
much into far too little, or the thing being performed.
   On the other hand, without the heavyweight team assembled
to put "Postcards From the Edge" onto the screen, there would
be nothing at all to anchor this piece of fluff. Ms. Fisher's
glib autobiographical novel sold well, presumably because it
satisfied the public's urge to discover, again and again,
that the rich and famous are miserable, too. Her wisecracking
approach offered the reassurance that she wasn't taking the
misery overseriously so it was okay to take pleasure in
reading about it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The book and the movie tell the story of Suzanne, a young
actress who seems very much like Ms. Fisher when she was a
young actress trying to recover from her problems: drugs and
mother. Suzanne's famous mother (Ms. Fisher's is Debbie
Reynolds) constantly upstages her daughter, and she drinks
too much.
   At best this may have worked as an overwrought soap opera,
sort of "A Turning Point" for addicts. After all, director
Mike Nichols did bring in Shirley MacLaine to play the
mother, creating great opportunities for some satisfying
lip-quivering. Or maybe it would have made a good musical;
Ms. Streep sings a couple of songs and proves once again (as
she did in "Ironweed") that she can deliver a song with
spirit and style.
   Instead Mr. Nichols decided to preserve the jokiness of
the original material, even while shifting the emphasis to
the mother-daughter conflict. There may have been a way to do
this and end up with a clever movie, but Mr. Nichols seems to
have had an even cleverer idea: He decided to use this movie
as a way to pay back social obligations.
   "Mike Nichols's great gift is that people want to work
with him, so once he and Meryl were on board it was like
giving a party -- let's say a party in honor of Meryl and
Mike. Who's not going to come? Well, everybody came," Ms.
Fisher has said.
   And so the cast is packed with first-rate actors in
third-rate parts. Still, it's good they're all there, because
figuring out who came to the party for Meryl and Mike becomes
the only interesting way to pass the time once one has
admired how prettily Michael Ballhaus has photographed Ms.
Streep.
   But soon her prettiness becomes bothersome as well. Why
does she look so pretty even when she's supposed to be
portraying a "coked up little actress?" There's not a trace
of that nasty calling card of the cokehead, those facial
lines that even the best makeup can't disguse. Even in the
few minutes the film devotes to Suzanne's druggy days Ms.
Streep looks positively radiant. She doesn't, however, look
like a woman so young that a drug rehabilitation counselor
would demand that she live with her mother on release. Yet
that's the premise of the movie.
   Most of the action takes place on the movie sets where
Suzanne goes to work in various costumes and suffers the
humiliation of being told she eats too much and that she must
take a drug test to work. She giggles, cringes and obeys
because, as everyone involved with this empty enterprise
earnestly wants us to believe: She's okay, she's okay.

   The young director Phil Joanou seems to understand
everything there is to know about gangster films and nothing
about the gangster soul. His "State of Grace," a picture
about Irish mobsters, has the uncertain air of a tourist in
New York reciting carefully memorized directions to a cab
driver. The out-of-towner may say all the right things, but
he doesn't have a clue and he isn't fooling anyone.
   The picture revolves around the Flannery family, who are
meant to be the Hell's Kitchen version of the Corleone
family. There is Kathleen, the estranged sister (Robin
Wright); Frankie, the cool businesslike brother who leads the
gang (Ed Harris); and Jackie (Gary Oldman), the violently
psychotic brother who moans about the disappearance of the
old neighborhood and periodically explodes with rage. Sean
Penn plays the old pal who reappears on the scene after a
long absence.
   The script, written by the late Dennis McIntyre and
doctored by David Rabe, has an original twist in an otherwise
unexceptional stew of modern-day gangsterisms. The Flannery
boys aren't big-time operators nor are they street punks. So
who are they? The picture isn't any clearer about them than
it is about the world they move in. There's some exposition
about moving uptown, and the yuppification of Hell's Kitchen,
but there's very little sense of a specific time and place.
   While Mr. Joanou understands where to put his camera, he
doesn't always know when to, and the story is frequently
muddled. He's put together a group of very good actors who
don't seem to know who they are and how they should behave.
   Every shot in the movie seems to have been lifted from
some other film. You can almost hear the director saying,
"Let's do the `Mean Streets' shot over here, `The Godfather
II' shot over there." It's as if the idea to make the
characters Irish came as an afterthought, a way to
differentiate these gangsters from the usual Italians. Yet
there is nothing in the rhythm of the characters' speech or
manner that identifies them as Irish, though Mr. Joanou does
stage the final scene in conjunction with the St. Patrick's
Day parade.

   VIDEO TIP: Mike Nichols used to make films that were
thought-provoking as well as moving as well as entertaining.
Remember "The Graduate," "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
"Carnal Knowledge," "Catch-22"?

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks staged a feeble rally
on a late-afternoon Egyptian report of a growing movement in
Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.83 to 380.32, a 0.2%
gain, after showing a slight loss most of the day. Volume
remained light at 98.5 million shares, down from 100.1
million shares Tuesday. Advancing stocks narrowly outpaced
decliners, 890 to 809.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The market's dull, choppy, and everybody's just watching
the news," said Jim O'Neill, co-manager of OTC trading for
Robinson-Humphrey Co. Mr. O'Neill agreed with other traders
that some investors took heart from an Egyptian news report
of growing Iraqi opposition to Saddam Hussein.
   Large, institutional investors continue to be selective,
while small investors are largely inactive, said James
Tarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San
Francisco. "It's extremely, extremely slow," he added.
   Some familiar OTC leaders regained favor as Nike sprinted
2 to 73 and Amgen rose 1 7/8 to 48. Both companies were
scheduled to appear yesterday at the final day of a
Montgomery Securities conference in San Francisco.
   Shortly before the market closed, Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
biotechnology analyst Jeffrey Casdin repeated a "buy" opinion
on Amgen, a biotechnology company based in Thousand Oaks,
Calif. Mr. Casdin said in an interview he has a "high degree
of confidence" that a Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel will convene Dec. 13 and 14 to review Amgen's G-CSF
product, which stimulates the production of white blood cells
to fight infection.
   If the panel recommends approval of the product, then it
could be marketed next year, he said. Mr. Casdin also said he
thinks Amgen's recent investment in a company that develops
products to treat neurological disorders will help keep the
stock trading at the current above-market multiple of its
earnings.
   There were a few bright spots in the technology sector.
Bullish analysts comments boosted Microsoft 1 7/8 to 57 3/8,
while AST Research added 1 to 19 after a favorable meeting
with analysts in New York.
   Lotus rebounded 1/2 to 17, after falling 1 1/2 Tuesday
when company officials said that growth will slow somewhat.
Intel also rose 3/4 to 32 3/4 and was the day's most active
stock.
   Elsewhere in the technology group, Conner Peripherals fell
1/4 to 22 1/4; Sun Microsytems eased 3/8 to 28 3/8; Seagate
Technology declined 1/4 to 8 1/2; Oracle Systems slipped 1/4
to 8 1/4; and Apple Computer was unchanged at 34. The Nasdaq
Industrial Index, which includes many large technology
shares, drifted most of the day but rallied at the close to
gain 1.66 to 406.45.
   Microsoft was featured by Goldman Sachs analyst Rick
Sherlund and Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst David
Readerman, both of whom repeated their "buy" opinions on the
Redmond, Wash., software maker. Mr. Sherlund said he expects
that sales of Microsoft's highly successful Windows 3.0
software this quarter could rapidly accelerate from the June
quarter, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.
   The analyst also raised his earnings estimate for
Microsoft's first quarter ending Sept. 30 to a range of 70
cents to 75 cents a share from his previous estimate of 63
cents. A year earlier Microsoft had profit of 43 cents a
share.
   Microsoft's new local area network product, called LAN
Manager, and network database product, SQL Server, are
critical to Shearson Lehman Brothers' estimated 30% to 35%
near-term growth rate for the company, Mr. Readerman told
DJPIR. LAN Manager will help Microsoft capture a share of the
approximately $1 billion personal computer networking market,
he said, adding that initial signs indicate the company is
having some success in capturing some market share from
Novell.
   Autodesk eased 1/2 to 46 1/2 after tumbling as low as 44
1/2. Traders attributed the fall to the resignation last week
of the company's vice president of software development,
Ronald McElhaney, and rumors that his departure could delay
the introduction of Release 11.2, the company's new
computer-aided design and drafting software product, DJPIR
reported. However, Autodesk's chief financial officer,
Carolyn V. Aver, said Mr. McElhaney's departure won't have
any impact on the product's release, which is expected in
October.
   TW Holdings was unchanged at 4 1/16 after slipping to 4
earlier in the day. The Spartanburg, S.C., provider of food,
vending and medical services said it is making two
prepayments totaling $70 million on senior debt out of
current cash flow. Last month, TW Holdings led OTC stocks
with the largest increase in short interest; the short
position in the company rose more than one million shares, to
nearly 2.2 million. Short-sellers borrow stock and sell it,
hoping to profit by returning cheaper shares to the lender.
Short interest is the total amount of shares sold short at a
given time.
   Among the day's gainers, AEL Industries Class A shares
jumped 7/8 to 5 3/4. Tuesday afternoon, the Lansdale, Pa.,
defense electronics concern reported that operating profit
for the second quarter ended Aug. 31 was 15 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.28 a share after an
$8 million special provision.
   Data Switch added 1/2 to 3 7/8. The Shelton, Conn., maker
of switching products told investors in a news release that
International Business Machines's introduction last week of
switching components expands Data Switch's market
opportunities.
   Alliant Computer Systems gained 1/4 to 2 3/4. Tuesday, the
Littleton, Mass., computer maker told investors in a news
release that it developed a new way for users in a Digital
VAX local area network to access an Alliant supercomputer.
   United Artists Entertainment Class A shares jumped 1 1/8
to 13. Officials with the Denver operator of cable television
stations and theaters met with with analysts Tuesday morning
and discussed a recent refinancng and its cable ventures in
the United Kingdom, DJPIR said.
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. analyst John Reidy told
DJPIR the refinancing now enables United Artists to borrow up
to $500 million with little difficulty. Mr. Reidy, who rates
the stock a "buy," said there was also enthusiasm at the
meeting for the company's British cable ventures and the
prospects for its cash-flow growth.
   First Executive Series F preferred shares tumbled 1 5/8 to
3 3/4. Last month, the troubled Los Angeles insurer said it
was considering halting dividend payments on all of its
preferred stock.

   Coca-Cola is no longer the only brand that can teach the
world to sing, a new study says. Along with the ubiquitous
soft drink, consumers now regard Sony, Mercedes-Benz, Kodak
and Disney as truly "global brands."
   Those names -- along with Nestle, Toyota, McDonald's, IBM
and Pepsi-Cola -- ranked high in a survey of brand awareness
with consumers in the U.S., Japan and Western Europe. The
study, conducted by Landor Associates, an image-consulting
concern based in San Francisco, defines a global brand as one
that is recognized well enough in the world's major markets
for shoppers to evaluate it against other available brands.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Ten years ago, we would have said Coca-Cola was the only
truly global brand," said Donald Casey, president of Landor.
The latest study identified up to 20 brands that were already
internationally known, and noted a further 45 brands poised
for global status.
   To gauge the consumer attitudes, Landor questioned 5,000
consumers in the U.S., 3,000 consumers in eight European
countries and 1,000 consumers in Japan. Consumers were asked
how familiar they were with some 800 different trademarks.
Respondents were then asked how highly they regarded those
brands. Combining the familiarity and esteem scores, Landor
then ranked the brands by "image power."
   But some critics question the value of asking consumers to
rate brands along such subjective criteria as esteem. "People
are going to have a lot more esteem for a Mercedes than for a
brand of toothpaste," said Alan Siegel, chairman of Siegel &amp;
Gale Inc., a corporate-identity unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Worldwide.
   Indeed, brands made by some of the world's most powerful
marketers, including Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Unilever Group,
are noticeably absent from the survey's top 20 brands. Even
Marlboro cigarettes, among the world's best-selling packaged
consumer products, were absent from the global rankings.
"It's hard to believe," says a spokesman for Philip Morris
Cos., which makes Marlboro. "It points out a question about
the validity of their idea of global brands."

   Mr. Mellor, 60 years old, succeeds Herbert Rogers, who
previously had indicated his intention to retire soon but
will now become vice chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two appointments stress important trends at General
Dynamics, a major defense contractor. First, Mr. Mellor's
promotion underscores the increasing role of international
sales at U.S. defense companies in general and General
Dynamics in particular; in his present role at the St. Louis
company, which he has played since 1986, Mr. Mellor has
concentrated on marketing M-1 tanks and F-16 jet fighters
abroad. As the U.S. defense budget is cut, success overseas
will become more crucial.
   Mr. Rogers's decision to stay on indefinitely, meanwhile,
is a sign of how much the company is determined to turn
around the A-12 aircraft line at its Fort Worth, Texas,
factory, where the 65-year-old General Dynamics veteran is
now on special assignment. In the second quarter, the company
recorded a $450 million charge on the A-12 program, which is
experiencing delays because of what Navy officials have
described as design problems and excessive weight.
   "We've got real heavy firepower on it" to rectify the A-12
situation, said William Anders, who is the company's current
vice chairman and who was named in September 1989 to become
chairman and chief executive officer when Stanley Pace
retires at the end of this year.
   Mr. Mellor was unavailable for comment yesterday. But Mr.
Anders, in an interview, described his colleague as "a solid,
instinctive businessman."
   "Besides being an experienced man, he is a pleasant
no-nonsense guy," Mr. Anders added. In a statement, Mr. Pace
said of Mr. Mellor: "He combines a technological know-how and
business sensitivity that will be invaluable in helping Bill
Anders guide the company through the difficult but opportune
times ahead."
   Mr. Mellor, an electrical engineer, joined General
Dynamics in 1981 and before that held various posts at
several defense companies, including Litton Industries Inc.
He was also president and chief operating officer of AM
International Inc., a graphics equipment concern in Chicago.

   WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators labored to overcome
differences on taxes and on how to enforce a
deficit-reduction accord as the bipartisan talks continued.
   Among the crucial unresolved issues were the Republicans'
demand for lower capital-gains taxes and the Democrats'
insistence that any such tax cut be combined with an increase
in income-tax rates for upper-income Americans, people close
to the talks said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, there was some tangible progress as the
administration accepted a new 10% tax on the purchase of
luxury items, a proposal advanced by the Democrats.
   Negotiators, who had hoped to reach an accord by this
morning, said they see little chance of reaching agreement
before tomorrow. House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said
he expects an agreement before week's end.
   Rep. Foley said Democrats will find it "extremely
difficult" to agree to a capital-gains cut unless it is
accompanied by higher income-tax rates "or some comparable
action." He didn't elaborate on what alternatives to higher
rates might be acceptable.
   "I don't sense any great hostility" to capital gains, said
Republican negotiator Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota. "The
problem is the price." He and other Republicans said they
won't go along with increased tax rates.
   Although there had been speculation that the
administration might back off its proposal to cut
capital-gains tax rates, President Bush underscored his
commitment to the idea in his speech to Congress.
   Both the administration and congressional Republicans have
emphasized the importance of changing the congressional
budget process to assure that any agreement is carried out.
Changes in taxes and benefit programs can be written into
law, but some other mechanism is being sought to limit other
domestic spending and defense spending, which are subject to
annual appropriations bills.
   Some Democrats, particularly Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), have resisted any
attempt to tie their hands for more than one year. The
initial Democratic offer made last week said the
appropriations committee would honor any ceiling on overall
spending, but would consider as "advisory only" any attempt
to set totals for defense and non-defense spending beyond
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   To meet their goal of reducing the deficit $500 billion in
five years, negotiators are converging on a plan that would
result in a net tax increase of about $130 billion. People
close to the talks said the tax package would probably
contain higher energy taxes, including an increase in the
gasoline tax, higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and an
extension of the 1.45% Medicare payroll tax to cover wages
above the current $51,300 ceiling. Tax breaks to encourage
oil exploration probably will be a part of any accord, they
added.
   In one of its latest offers, the administration proposed
four new taxes that would raise $2.5 billion in fiscal 1991
and more than $24 billion over the five-year period. The
largest of these taxes is a one-cent-agallon tax on refined
petroleum products that would raise about $1 billion in the
first year and $8 billion over five years.
   The GOP and White House also would impose a luxury tax
that would raise $900 million in the first year and $7.8
billion over five years. This closely matches a Democratic
proposal for a new tax on purchases of luxury items. The
Republicans' 10% luxury tax would be imposed on automobiles
that cost more than $30,000, boats that cost more than
$30,000, electronics of more than $1,000, jewelry of more
than $5,000, and furs of more than $500.
   In addition, the Republican would index to inflation a
variety of excise taxes and would accept a tax on
ozone-depleting chemicals similar to one proposed by the
Democrats.
   Defense spending would be cut between $170 billion and
$200 billion from projected levels over five years, based on
offers made by the two sides. Domestic spending of all sorts
would be trimmed between $103 billion and $126 billion, with
both sides proposing to make the elderly pay more of the cost
of Medicare.
   The American Association of Retired Persons, recalling the
uproar that led Congress to repeal a surtax on upper-income
elderly that was to pay for an expansion of Medicare to cover
catastrophic illness, objected to proposals to increase
Medicare premiums for upper-income people. "It is
catastrophic without the benefits," the group said.

And I propose that the Community should declare unequivocally

Europe as members if they want to join, provided that
democracy has taken root and that their economies are capable
of sustaining membership. We cannot say in one breath that
they are part of Europe and in the next our European

   This does not mean that the further development of the

But if . . . we set off down the path of giving more and more
powers to highly centralised institutions, which are not

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)
SECURITIES (SCR)
</IN>
<LP>
   When Leo Bouchard of Oakland, Maine, was looking to put
away some money for his children's education five years ago,
he turned to a mutual fund sold by First Investors
Consolidated Corp., which manages $3.6 billion in fund
assets.
   "They made promises like you wouldn't believe," says Mr.
Bouchard, a salesman for a medical-supply company. But he did
believe the salesman who told him: "`You'll make 12.25% on
your money. Guaranteed.' Guaranteed was the word." That was
the pitch, Mr. Bouchard says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mutual funds are legally obliged to send all new investors
a copy of a fund's prospectus, which, among other things, is
supposed to spell out the risks entailed. Mr. Bouchard says
he got no prospectus from First Investors.
   Mr. Bouchard, who was new to investing, says that over the
course of 4 1/2 years he put $7,000 into First Investors Fund
for Income, a junk-bond mutual fund. And during that time, he
says, his account was handled by seven or eight different
salespeople. "In one summer, we went through three or four
reps," he says. "They were all young kids."
   As it turned out, Mr. Bouchard didn't lose his shirt, but
he did lose $1,000, and this year he sold his stake. "We got
out because the shares were going down and down," he says.
"They said the shares would come back up, but they never
did."
   Funds holding junk, or high-yield, bonds haven't fared
well since mid-1989, but the performance of First Investors'
two large junk-bond funds has been especially dismal. And
according to former First Investors salespeople, Mr.
Bouchard's treatment as a client is hardly unique. Others,
too, put up money without fully realizing that they were
buying into a risky deal.
   For years, First Investors has used an army of novice
sales representatives to sell junk-bond mutual funds that
have performed poorly while charging sales commissions that
are higher than most junk-bond funds. In making their
pitches, former salespeople say, they often emphasized lavish
dividend yields but talked little about the fact that one
would lose money should share prices decline.
   Mutual funds have enjoyed explosive growth in the past
decade, and First Investors has grown with them. The
company's assets under management ballooned from less than
$800 million in 1979 to more than $4 billion in 1989. But
assets have since slipped back to $3.6 billion, and the
company may be in an extended decline.
   The first blow came last year with the collapse of the
junk-bond market. Now other problems loom. Sales practices at
the 60-year-old concern are being scrutinized by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and by a passel of state
regulators.
   During a two-hour interview, the company's two highest
officers decline to say anything about the investigations.
But First Investors' president, David Grayson, and its
chairman, Glenn Head, each of whom owns 36% of the privately
held company's voting stock, do argue that First Investors'
problems involve little other than the complaints of
disgruntled former employees and a junk-bond market in the
doldrums. "Nobody would have a lot of complaints if they made
a lot of money with us," says Mr. Grayson.
   That's the problem. Clients led to believe their
investments carried little risk have been losing money and
are unhappy about it. Furthermore, questions have been raised
about whether First Investors has tried rather too hard to
sell junk-bond funds to credulous investors who don't
understand what they are getting into.
   First Investors isn't a typical mutual-fund company. The
firm went into business in 1930 selling -- but not managing
-- mutual funds. By the 1960s, it had become a major
distributor of such venerable funds as Fundamental Investors,
which has since become part of the American Funds Group, and
Wellington Fund, now distributed by Vanguard Group.
   First Investors got heavily involved in fund management
only after Mr. Grayson and Mr. Head took it private in a
leveraged buy-out in 1968. Messrs. Grayson and Head also
rapidly expanded the company's sales network. Today First
Investors has 150 offices, up from just 35 in 1968. Though
its sales force of 2,500 can sell other funds, salespeople
say they are told to stick to the company's own products.
   Today, First Investors' is trying to compete not so much
with such industry giants as Fidelity Investments or Vanguard
Group, but, rather, with the local bank. Well-rehearsed
salespeople ask potential investors what they are earning on
their savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Then reps
tell prospects about the much higher yields currently
available in First Investors' two large junk-bond funds, its
$982 million Fund for Income and its $648 million High Yield
Fund.
   "Their target is middle America," says Brian D. Mahoney,
who for four years worked as a salesman in the company's New
Haven, Conn., office. "The idea is to compare the yield to
passbook savings and CDs."
   With a CD, investors get a fixed, predictable return,
whereas the share price on a junk-bond fund fluctuates. But
in a script put together by First Investors employees in
California, salespeople were encouraged to turn the
comparison to their advantage. "Remember how we computed the
yield?" reads the script. "We divided the total dividends
over the last 12 months by the current offering price and got
the rate of return. Well, if the price drops, your yield goes
up] We've created an investment where you win whether the
price goes up or down]"
   Shown this script, Mr. Grayson and Mr. Head disavow any
knowledge of it. They say that scripted sales patters were
phased out over the past few years and that earlier this year
the firm sent out a directive to employees that scripts were
no longer to be used. "We were amazed at the number of
scripts going around," says Mr. Grayson, who maintains that
in the scripts distributed by management, salespeople had
been directed to tell investors that rates of return weren't
guaranteed and that share prices would fluctuate.
   Lately, most of the share-price fluctuations have been
downward. According to New York's Lipper Analytical Services,
both Fund for Income and High Yield lost more than 11% in the
year that ended June 30, in contrast to a 5.6% loss for the
average junk-bond fund. Fund for Income (known by employees
as Fifi) had a total return of 7.1% a year over the past
decade, making it the 24th poorest-performing junk fund on a
list of 26. "No way should you put money into the high yield
area of First Investors, period," asserts Tyler Jenks,
director of research with Boston's Kanon Bloch Carre &amp; Co., a
mutual-fund research concern. Mutual Fund Values, a
newsletter published by Chicago's Morningstar Inc., gives
First Investors' two junk funds its lowest rating.
   Fund for Income's "objective was always yield first,"
concedes Mr. Head. "It's perfectly reasonable to have an
objective of a higher yield," he adds. But last year the
funds changed strategy. "Both Fifi and High Yield became more
conservative in their selection of bonds and their trading of
bonds," says Mr. Head. "This change began to show results in
the second quarter of 1990."
   Michael Rukujzo, a former First Investors salesman who
worked in the Chicago office, says most of his clients knew
little or nothing about mutual funds. "Whenever I approached
a client who had any investment experience, I'd never get the
sale," says Mr. Rukujzo, who now works for Kanon Bloch's
brokerage subsidary.
   Until the junk-bond market started disintegrating in
mid-1989, some First Investors shareholders say they had no
idea that they had their money in the riskiest sector of the
bond market. Five years ago, a New Yorker named Marvin Rock
put $40,000 into four First Investors funds. But then, eager
to get higher dividends, he moved his entire investment into
Fifi.
   "I was under the impression you couldn't lose money," says
Mr. Rock, who was sent a copy of the fund's prospectus but
says he didn't bother to read it because he assumed the fund
was a safe investment. "In the beginning, I didn't even know
the share price could go up and down." By the time Mr. Rock
finally got out of the Fund for Income this past January, his
$40,000 had shrunk to $28,000.
   Gary Barkman was a First Investors salesman until he quit
earlier this year. "I was right out of college, just like
most of the people there," recalls Mr. Barkman, who joined
First Investors in October 1984.
   After two job interviews, Mr. Barkman was accepted for the
training program. First, he took a two-week course to prepare
for the National Association of Securities Dealers' licensing
exam, which must be passed before one can sell mutual funds.
As sometimes happens in the securities industry, Mr. Barkman
himself had to pay the licensing fee and tuition, which in
his case totaled $287. He then took First Investors' two-week
"product knowledge" class, during which new employees are
expected to write the names of potential customers in their
so-called bankbook. "The homework each night was to come up
with 20 {additional} names," says Mr. Barkman.
   The final hurdle: learning the sales pitch. "If you {had}
the script memorized, then you {were} cleared through to talk
to your prospects," says Mr. Barkman. His first customers
were friends and relatives. "I don't know anybody who has
been successful at First Investors who hasn't started there,"
he says.
   Mr. Barkman rose swiftly through the ranks, and last year
earned nearly $80,000 in commissions as a manager of the
First Investors' Schenectady, N.Y., office.
   "I was the perfect epitome of what the management-training
program could do," he says. In March 1990, Mr. Barkman and 15
other salespeople left First Investors and joined another
securities firm, Capital Growth &amp; Shelter Inc. Now, he says,
"it's hard for me to admit that I worked there."
   After Mr. Barkman and the 15 others quit, First Investors
sought a preliminary injunction to keep them from soliciting
business from their old First Investors clients and to bar
them from trying to hire away other First Investors
representatives. The injunction was denied by the New York
Supreme Court, though Mr. Barkman and the others were
compelled to return records that they had taken when they
left their jobs. In a countersuit against First Investors,
Mr. Barkman alleges that his "reputation as a financial
consultant has been irreparably damaged" as a result of
having worked there. He is seeking $10 million in damages.
   Mr. Grayson, First Investors' president, estimates that
for every four or five representives who pass the NASD
licensing exam, only one will still be with the company a
year later. Thus, its salesmen are constantly on the lookout
for new recruits, and First Investors even operates an
unusual incentive system under which one salesman who
recruits another can get a cut of the mutual-fund commission
revenue the new guy pulls in and continue to get the cut as
long as he himself works there. "The best reps are normally
brought in by other reps," says Mr. Grayson.
   The first sign of trouble for First Investors came last
year, when it was disclosed that the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office were
scrutinizing transactions by Benalder Bayse Jr., who at the
time was manager of First Investors' junk-bond funds. The
current inquiry is focusing on whether Mr. Bayse was given a
personal stake in a Drexel Burnham Lambert partnership in
return for buying securities underwritten by Drexel for the
funds he managed. Mr. Bayse left the employ of First
Investors late last year. Mr. Bayse's lawyer declines to
comment on the inquiry.
   People contacted by SEC investigators say the agency has
been looking into First Investors' sales practices, and not
just into Mr. Bayse. The agency declines to comment.
   Earlier this year, First Investors' periodic-payment plans
came under fire from Maine's Securities Division. Such
arrangements once were widespread in the industry, but now
only a handful of mutual-fund companies offer them. These
plans are designed to encourage investors to sock away a
small sum of money, say $50 or $100, every month for 10 or 15
years. The commission in the first year can run as high as
50% of what has been invested.
   Commissions aren't exorbitant if investors stick with
their plans. But in March, Maine's Securities Division
published a report showing that many First Investors
shareholders dropped out of the plans early. These investors
ended up paying commissions well above the legal maximum
sales charge of 9% of the amount invested. As a result of the
Maine report, other state securities administrators are
scrutinizing periodic-payment plans.
   Perhaps the biggest threat to First Investors is coming
from a group of four state securities administrators.
Investigators from Georgia, Massachusetts, New York and
Virginia are now investigating the company. Results of the
joint investigation could be made public as early as next
month. Officials from Georgia, Massachusetts and Virginia
decline to comment. A spokesman for the New York attorney
general's office confirms that New York is investigating but
offers no details.
   Former salespeople contacted by investigators say the four
states are looking at First Investors' sales practices, in
particular the contents of its sales pitches. They also are
said to be interested in what was taught in First Investors'
training classes and in whether the funds sold were suitable
for clients.
   Though First Investors refuses to comment on the
investigations, Mr. Grayson says the company has "definitely
not" been involved in any illegal activities. But the company
says it has nonetheless recently rewritten sales literature
to emphasize investment risks. It says it has also revamped
its training program to impress upon salespeople that the
funds they sell must be suitable based on each client's
willingness to incur risk. The firm says that a year ago it
started calling all new account holders to make sure they
fully understood what sort of funds they had purchased and
what the sales charges are.

   BEEF'S BACK with a new image and higher price. But some
cry fowl.
   Leaner steaks and meaner advertising help boost red meat's
image as beef cattle prices hit a record 75.4 cents a pound
in August. Economists say prices are higher even than tight
supplies warrant; some suspect a change in consumer tastes,
encouraged by ads touting trim cuts to counter cholesterol,
calorie concerns. "There's a different attitude about beef,"
says Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst at Shearson Lehman
Brothers. Perhaps. But a spokesman for Dominick's Finer Foods
Inc., Chicago, notes: "The trend is still away from red meat
and towards poultry and seafood."

   Chicken's still the top seller, but it may be bumped due
to a technicality next year. Starting in 1991, the
Agriculture Department will tighten up its formula for
subtracting nonessential bird parts like bones and organs
from consumption data. Still, beef's comeback may be
short-lived if a recession hits and consumers switch to
cheaper meats. Supply may also be a problem -- at any price.
In 1989, the nation's herd shrank to its smallest numbers
since 1961, and ranchers remain leery about expanding.
   Beefed up, but still down: Per capita beef consumption may
slip another two pounds this year to about 67 pounds.
                                                                                                       

   TAKE A LETTER. Service firms pick up the pen for lazy
correspondents.
   Action Write Now], a Farmingdale, N.Y., direct-mail firm,
expands with customized letters for lobbying groups big and
small. For about $4 a letter or $11 for a mini-campaign, it
digs up legislator addresses, fires up the laser printers and
signs with script. Options: real stamps, telegram stationery.
In Boston, WordRight offers daily writing tips over its
900-number. "You know how people are about writing, they're
afraid of it," says Susan Benjamin, president, adding: "I
have a woman who calls me up for memos." A WordRight call
costs $2 a minute; related instructional audio tapes are
$11.95 each. Is MathRight next?
   As for social correspondence, greeting card companies try
to thaw writers' block with hot products. American Greetings
offers Anytime Cards and tests a back-to-school theme;
Hallmark's "Just How I Feel" line notes "all sorts of
personal feelings and relationships." Not everyone approves.
Don't even think of sending storebought thank-you cards, says
Judith Martin, who writes as "Miss Manners," noting they're
more costly and "a lot less charming." And matters of the
heart? "If you've ever been in love and kissed a signature,
you know that the person who actually wrote it makes a big
difference," she says.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. QUALITY gets better. But pricing, innovation problems
loom.
   Improvements to American goods grow, but cost
efficiencies, new-product gains don't, says the Boston
University School of Management Manufacturing Roundtable. Its
latest survey finds quality improved at an annual rate of 7%,
up from under 6% in the 1988 survey. But cost and new-product
introduction gains were flat at 2% to 3%, trailing Japan.
"Americans caught on to quality" but "aren't addressing the
other issues with equal fervor," says Jeffrey Miller, author.
   The survey of some 200 manufacturers also identified
several major obstacles facing U.S. manufacturers, including
a lack of shared vision within companies; misaligned
performance and incentive measures; poorly educated workers;
environmental regulations and lack of trust by suppliers.
   More than half say they begin product manufucturing
feasibility tests only after most of the design work is done.
                                                                                                       

   TAKING THE LOW ROAD: Travel Agent magazine offers this tip
on minimizing damage done to the cruise industry by the
Mideast crisis: "Americans are notorious for their poor sense
of geography, and that is a greater threat to agents than
bullets and rising oil prices combined." The article suggests
displaying large maps.
                                                                                                       

   NO BRAINS NEEDED. The USDA says exports of edible innards
like kidneys, livers and hearts are likely to shrink by
two-thirds to $30 million in 1990, due largely to Europe's
ban on meats with hormones.
                                                                                                       

   MORE IN HAND. Men's ties are wider (by about a half-inch),
bolder (especially florals) and pricier (up $5 or so) than
last year, says an NBO Stores Inc. survey.
                                                                                                       

   DEBT COLLECTION firms may flash a warning light on
approaching recession.
   When claims spurt and collections shrink, bill collectors
start talking recession. "We certainly are starting to see
some signs," says Les Kirschbaum, president of Mid-Continent
Agencies Inc., Glenview, Ill. He says claims jumped 15% in
August and continue at that pace so far this month.
Previously, claims were growing 8% to 9%. Meanwhile,
collectibility is slowing, although not dramatically. Still,
if the trend continues, chances of a recession accelerate, he
says.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet chief economist Joseph Duncan cautions
that collectibility ratios are far from perfect predictors.
For one thing, companies in deep trouble sometimes pay bills
"early so stress doesn't show on the balance sheet," he says.
Separately, Mr. Duncan notes early readings on Dun's business
expectations survey "show a sharp weakening in business
optimism."
   A growing trend: Asking old customers for new financial
data to better assess their ability to pay for orders.

   WASHINGTON -- The budget negotiators' goal of reducing the
federal deficit by $500 billion over the next five years is
"considerably more modest" than is needed, the General
Accounting Office said.
   The investigative arm of Congress said a $500 billion
package would be only "a first step" and ought to be followed
by an even larger $550 billion round of deficit reduction in
fiscal 1996 and 1997.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its 140-page report, the GAO said the government ought
to run a surplus to ensure that the nation saves more and
invests more for the future. By 1997, the GAO said, the
surplus should equal 2% of the gross national product, the
total output of the economy. "The average deficit as a
percent of the GNP has doubled every 10 years for the past 40
years," the GAO said. It is now at about 4% of GNP.
   As a result, interest payments are the fastest growing
item in the budget. "Current projections indicate that debt
service costs will replace defense as the largest item in the
budget by 1992," the GAO said.
   Separately, the director of the Congressional Budget
Office, Robert Reischauer, said that the slowing U.S. economy
and the effects of the Persian Gulf crisis could push the
deficit as high as $267 billion in fiscal 1991 without some
action by Congress and the White House. In July, the office
put the deficit at $232 billion.

   TW Holdings Inc. said it is making two prepayments
totaling $70 million on senior debt, reflecting "better than
anticipated" operations.
   TW, which in December 1989 acquired TW Services Inc., the
giant food-services concern with 1989 revenue of $3.5
billion, said a $40 million prepayment made yesterday was
applied to four quarterly principal payments of term A senior
debt, scheduled to begin Dec. 1.

   TW, a Spartanburg, S.C., provider of food, vending and
medical services said the other $30 million, which it plans
to pay today, will reduce the bridge portion of its senior
bank loan to $267.5 million. The company said it expects to
pay off the balance of the bridge loan by Dec. 1 with
proceeds from planned asset sales and real estate financings.
   Karl Sedlarz, vice president and treasurer, said cash flow
has been better than expected, largely because of controls on
capital expenditures and strong revenue, which rose 7.7% in
the six months ended June 30 to $1.8 billion from $1.67
billion a year earlier.
   TW owns Canteen, the big contract food and vending
service, Denny's restaurants, and the Quincy's Family
Steakhouse chain, and is the largest franchisee of Hardee's
restaurants.
   Coniston Partners, the New York-based investment concern,

   TORONTO -- The Canadian Auto Workers union rejected a
contract proposal by the Canadian subsidiary of Ford Motor
Co., and both sides predicted it will be difficult to avert a
strike scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight.
   Terms of the contract proposal, which covered economic
issues such as wages, vacations and cost-of-living
allowances, weren't disclosed. Both sides referred to the
offer, the first tabled by the company since negotiations
began last week, as a "basis for further discussion."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CAW President Robert White said Ford was moving in the
right direction with its contract proposal. But he said the
amount of money the company was offering was "not even close"
to the union's demands. He said he doubted there was enough
time to reach a settlement before the strike deadline. The
current contract, covering 12,800 Ford workers, expires
tomorrow.
   Ford Canada spokesman James Hartford said a tentative
contract agreement before the strike deadline was
"achievable," but only with "considerable effort."
   "One of the serious players here is the clock," Mr.
Hartford said.
   The CAW began contract talks last Wednesday after
selecting Ford as its strike target. Any contract reached
will serve as a model for later talks with the Canadian
subsidiaries of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.

   DeKalb Genetics Corp. estimated that per-share earnings

   In fiscal 1989, the company earned $12.1 million, or $2.14

   The DeKalb, Ill., company said all three of its businesses
-- seed, swine and poultry -- contributed to the improved
performance. Its largest business, hybrid seed corn, will
report increased sales in the U.S., driven by both higher
planted corn acreage and increased market share for its corn
hybrids.
   DeKalb also said it estimates that its return on equity
exceeded 1989's 12.2%, but that it didn't reach its near-term
goal of 15%.

   Alberta's Offering

   EDMONTON, Alberta -- The Alberta government said it
expects to raise 951 million Canadian dollars (US$819.1
million) from an initial public offering of shares of Telus
Corp., the new holding company that owns Alberta's big
telephone utility.
   Alberta telecommunications minister Fred Stewart said the
C$12-a-share issue is the largest equity offering ever in
Canada. He added the offering has drawn "overwhelming"
interest in Alberta, where investors can buy Telus shares for
C$6 each, and pay the balance next September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since investor demand in Alberta exceeded the issue's size
by about C$450 million, Mr. Stewart said the government has
had to limit the number of shares that can be purchased on
the two-part installment plan to a maximum of 900 per
investor.
   Demand for the offering, which is expected to be completed
by Sept. 28, has proven a windfall for the issue's 11-member
underwriting group, led by RBC Dominion Securities Inc. of
Toronto. With trading volumes down sharply this year in
Canada and many securities dealers posting operating losses,
the estimated 3.7% average underwriting and selling
commission earned by dealers on the issue has offered some
welcome relief.
   "It has been a very good issue for us," said Tony Melvyn,
a broker in the Edmonton office of Levesque Beaubien
Geoffrion Inc., a securities dealer based in Toronto.
   The offering of more than 79.3 million Telus shares,
representing a 60% stake in the company, has also drawn heavy
interest from the 11,500 eligible employees of Alberta
Government Telephones, Telus's main subsidiary. About 84% of
the big utility's staff subscribed to the issue, Mr. Stewart
said.
   As previously reported, the Alberta government first
announced in May its plans to privatize Alberta Government
Telephones, which is Canada's third largest
telecommunications concern with assets of about C$2.8 billion
and 1989 revenue of C$1.2 billion.
   The government intends to retain the remaining 40% stake
in Telus for at least a year.

   NEW YORK -- Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said it will market
directories on Soviet business data to companies in the West.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet signed an agreement with the Information
and Publishing Center of Goskomstat, the U.S.S.R.'s state
committee on statistics. The company plans to offer the
Soviet data in four directories, beginning in the fourth
quarter of 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One directory will include the names and addresses of all
operational joint ventures. Another directory will provide
data on 500 of the largest Soviet manufacturing businesses.
The third will list names and addresses of Soviet export
enterprises. The fourth will be an annual directory
containing historical Soviet import and export trade
statistics for 1988, 1989, and 1990, and quarterly data for
1991 forward.
   "The information made available by this agreement will
help Western firms to evaluate emerging business
opportunities in the Soviet Union," said Charles W. Moritz,
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Each directory should sell for less than $100 although a
price has yet to be set, according to the marketer of
business information and related services.

   Delay Construction

   PITTSFIELD, Mass. -- General Electric Co. confirmed
reports that it is delaying construction of a $2.5 billion
plastics facility in Spain because of weakening world-wide
market conditions.
   The plant was to be near Cartagena on the Mediterranean
coast with completion scheduled for 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for the GE Plastics unit said a new
construction schedule is being discussed with the Spanish
government but declined to disclose details. The Spanish
government has donated the site and is to bear 30% of the
cost through subsidies and grants.
   Robert Reitzes, an analyst who follows chemicals and
plastics at Mabon Nugent &amp; Co., said rising oil prices since
the Mideast crisis are forcing plastic makers, already
skittish in a weakening economy, to rethink expansion plans.
He cited Union Carbide Co. and Du Pont Co., among several,
considering "indefinite delays."
   GE Plastics first announced its plans in October 1988,
saying the investment would total $1.7 billion. In 1989, it
increased the planned investment to $2.5 billion for a larger
manufacturing facility. Since then, the world-wide economy
has softened, especially demand in the automotive market, the
spokeswoman said.
   GE expects to export 90% of the plant's output, silicon
sealants for the construction industry and polycarbonate
plastics for autos, and computer consoles. The facility was
to begin production in two to three years from the date of
the initial announcement, with a work force of about 500 and
eventually expanding to 1,500 workers.
   The spokeswoman said the company's commitment to build the
facility hasn't changed.

   DU PONT Co. and Union Carbide Co. say neither is delaying
nor considering a delay of any plastics plant construction.
In Thursday's edition, an article incorrectly included them
among companies considering such delays.

   Brazil to Ease

   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian President Fernando Collor de
Mello, continuing his drive to liberalize the country's
economy, unveiled plans to speed up the opening of the
computer and electronics industry to foreign competition.
   In an announcement that will be welcomed by Brazil's major
trading partners, the government said it will end its
controversial "market reserve" for electronics by Oct. 29,
1992, two years ahead of schedule. The market reserve
effectively prevented the import of foreign computers,
software and electronics to Brazil.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, the government said the list of
protected items is to be reduced to 30 immediately. Those
items, to be specified later, will include microcomputers and
minicomputers and software that cost no more than three times
the price of foreign-made equivalents.
   All other products can now be imported immediately,
provided import duties are paid, or produced locally by
multinational companies. Protection also will be lifted for
computers, electronics and telecommunications equipment that
is more than four years old.
   In a bid to allow Brazil to overcome its technological
lag, the government also said it will submit a bill to
Congress that would reduce obligatory local content in
electronics to 30% from 70% now. The government also said it
would allow foreign companies to hold 49% of joint ventures,
compared with a maximum 30% now.
   The moves are part of Mr. Collor's efforts to boost the
competitiveness of Brazil's economy and end its longstanding
protectionist trade policies, which he feels have caused
Brazil to fall behind in terms of technology and quality. "It
will be a great challenge to the nation's industry to face
foreign competition," Jose Goldemberg, Brazil's science and
technology secretary, said.
   The market reserve was created by the military governments
that ruled from 1964 to 1985. Big multinational companies,
such as International Business Machines Corp., were limited
to the production of large computers.

   Southeastern Peanut Crop
   Is Hurt by Drought, Heat

   ATLANTA -- Drought and searing heat have dealt the
Southeast peanut crop a double wallop that is expected to
have an estimated $575 million economic impact on a
three-state region and to drive up consumer prices for peanut
products, especially peanut butter.
   The region -- which includes Georgia, Florida, and Alabama
and produces 65% of U.S. peanuts -- is bracing for its worst
crop in 10 years. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture
statistics, the region will reap 2.04 billion pounds of
peanuts, down 23% from last year and 24% below an Aug. 1
forecast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Peanut Advisory Board, a trade association, said
peanut prices increased 12%, to $731 a ton, in the past week
and may go higher, depending on weather and crop conditions
through next month. The board said the direct loss to farmers
will be about $150 million; the balance of the estimated $575
million loss will be felt by shellers and others in related
businesses.
   The two other areas that are big producers of peanuts --
the Virginia and North Carolina region and the region of New
Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas -- are expected to enjoy increases
in crop output of 15% and 10%, respectively over last year,
but not enough to make up the loss from the Southeast. The
USDA said this year's U.S. crop is expected to be 3.56
billion pounds, down 11%.
   Prices of peanut butter are expected to rise the most,
because it is made from the type of peanuts grown in the
Southeast, the Peanut Advisory Board said. It estimates
consumer peanut-butter prices will go up 10% by January.

   Awaits Outcome of Suitor's Search for Funds

   NEW YORK -- It's a Hollywood cliffhanger that has run
longer than most TV series: Will anybody ever close a deal to
buy MGM/UA Communications?
   For more than two years, the movie and television
production and distribution company has been up for sale.
More than 100 potential buyers have been contacted. Two
companies controlled by foreigners, each aspiring to roar
like the MGM lion, have reached separate agreements to pay
more than $1 billion for MGM/UA.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the first agreement, with Qintex Australia, fell apart
in October 1989 when Qintex couldn't raise enough money to
complete the deal. And the second, with Pathe Communications,
was scheduled to close in June but extended to Oct. 23
because of Pathe's own difficulties in obtaining financing.
   Because of this history, and continuing questions about
Pathe's ability to procure the $900 million or so in cash
needed to close the deal, MGM/UA shares are trading at a big
discount to the proposed purchase price. Though Pathe
proposes to pay $17.50 in cash for each MGM/UA share, the
stock has been trading closer to 14 1/2 and closed yesterday
at 15 1/4, up 5/8. (MGM/UA shareholders got a separate cash
distribution of $4 a share July 20, funded by Pathe's $253
million "down payment" on the acquisition.)
   The discount reflects deep skepticism among takeover-stock
traders about whether Pathe Chairman Giancarlo Parretti can
complete the transaction in the next six weeks. "Unless he
can pull a rabbit out of a hat and come up with close to $900
million, the deal's not getting done," says one
takeover-stock trader who is betting it won't be completed on
schedule.
   If the accord with Pathe falls apart, traders and analysts
believe MGM/UA stock could fall below 10, and perhaps into
the range of 7 to 8, where it traded before efforts to sell
the company began in April 1988.
   Pathe officials "are still as confident as ever that they
can do the deal," a spokesman for Pathe says. But Pathe
refuses to discuss where its money will come from, saying it
"won't disclose bits and pieces" of the financing package.
   A major incentive for completing the takeover is the "down
payment," now totaling $303 million, that Pathe has made
since March. That's far more money, the reasoning goes, than
anybody would throw away on a deal that they can't complete.
   What is sometimes lost in discussions of Pathe's down
payment is that the money won't be entirely wasted even if
Pathe can't complete its acquisition of MGM/UA. If the accord
doesn't close, MGM/UA is supposed to issue 12 million new
common shares (a 19% stake) and put them in an escrow account
for Pathe. Pathe, however, wouldn't be able to take ownership
of the shares until after litigation stemming from the deal's
collapse is settled. And MGM/UA would be able to take the
shares as payment of any damages assessed against Pathe.
   If Pathe isn't able to complete the transaction on time,
MGM/UA's fate will once again be in the hands of its
controlling shareholder, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian. As the
owner of 71% of MGM/UA's common shares and practically all of
its preferred shares, Mr. Kerkorian can decide whether to
grant Pathe another extension (perhaps in return for more
down payments or other concessions) or to launch yet another
search for a new buyer. Though MGM's board must consider the
interests of public shareholders, the company's bylaws don't
provide for a separate vote by minority shareholders on
merger proposals.
   Clearly, the secretive Mr. Kerkorian wants to sell MGM/UA.
He has listened to a host of proposals from big,
well-financed U.S., European and Japanese companies. As
described in proxy material for MGM/UA's Oct. 2 shareholders
meeting, the interested parties included MCA, Walt Disney,
Paramount, Sony, Time Warner and PolyGram, plus well-known
figures such as Marvin Davis, Rupert Murdoch, Robert Maxwell
and Donald Trump.
   An acquisition of MGM/UA by any company with a major U.S.
movie studio could easily run into antitrust problems. And
Mr. Kerkorian has demanded consistently that the proposed
buyer of MGM/UA bear the risks of litigation and an adverse
antitrust ruling. So far, nobody has been willing to take
those risks.
   Even traders and analysts who doubt that Pathe will buy
MGM/UA on schedule believe that the company will be sold
eventually. But Mr. Kerkorian, by all accounts a very healthy
72-year-old, seems to be in no hurry.
   In the meantime, MGM/UA's modest operating earnings --
including revenue from the "thirtysomething" and "In the Heat
of the Night" TV series -- are more than consumed by interest
payments on $400 million of long-term debt.
   Shareholders can take some comfort in estimates that the
MGM/UA film library alone is valued at between $700 million
and $900 million. The library, which has more than 1,000
United Artists movies and the 34 MGM movies released since
1986, includes the various James Bond, Rocky and Pink Panther
films.
   Time Warner, in fact, was willing to lend Pathe $650
million, secured by the film library, to help finance the
MGM/UA purchase, but backed away after it appeared that Pathe
was having trouble raising the rest of the money. Now, Time
Warner and Pathe are suing each other, and Mr. Parretti has
said he's too busy trying to find financing to undergo a
grilling by Time Warner lawyers.

   Short of hiring Sam Spade, is there any way investors can
find out if their financial planner ever went to the slammer,
or their stockbroker really went to Harvard?
   With fraud and other abuses by financial advisers on the
rise, say regulators, it's more important than ever for
investors to check the background of their broker or planner.
A history of disciplinary actions, or discrepancies in an
adviser's credentials, can be a tipoff to potential trouble.

   One of the first things investors can do to check out a
financial adviser is to call their state securities
department. (Investors can get local numbers by calling the
North American Securities Administrators Association in
Washington, D.C., at 202-737-0900.)
   When you call the state securities department, employees
there can enter the name of an individual or firm into a
50-state computer data base maintained jointly by the North
American Securities Administrators Association and the
National Association of Securities Dealers.
   The system, called CRD, for Central Registration
Depository, keeps track of anyone registered to sell
securities in any state. It maintains records on an
individual's education and former employment. It also shows
whether he or she has ever filed for bankruptcy; been the
subject of a complaint by state or federal regulators or the
subject of a legal injunction against doing business, or been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to investment-related
misdemeanors or felonies.
   If a broker or financial planner is not listed in the data
base at all, "you've got a problem," says John Perkins, the
Missouri commissioner of securities. It could mean they are
not registered to sell securities.
   But, in some circumstances, a person or firm may have a
legitimate reason for not registering. This would include
anyone who doesn't sell investments (such as financial
planners who accept only fees and don't sell investment
products -- a group that comprises about 10% of all financial
planners). Firms that sell commodities, including foreign
currencies, may also be absent from CRD, since they are not
required to register under the securities laws of most
states.
   If the CRD computer draws a blank, investors should ask
the firm or person for references from such sources as trade
associations and banks with which they do business. They can
also ask securities regulators for help in identifying other
avenues to investigate, says Missouri's Mr. Perkins.
   However, even if a person or firm is registered, and has
no negative information filed, the investor's job isn't done.
Says Mark Maddox, Indiana commissioner of securities: "Simply
because a company is properly registered and has no
disciplinary action doesn't mean a lot these days."
   For example, sometimes the information supplied to
investors by state securities departments from the CRD system
isn't always complete or accurate. Recently, a reporter
phoned state securities regulators in four states. She asked
if any negative information existed on a brokerage firm that
had, in fact, been barred from doing business in at least one
state. One state employee said the company wasn't listed in
the CRD system, while two others said the company was listed
but had no disciplinary history.
   Also, the securities industry is resisting efforts by
regulators to require that brokers and other advisers
disclose information about pending legal actions against
them.
   Because of such limitations, investors may have to make
other inquiries. But other resources may not be much better.
For example, Financial Planning Resource Foundation Inc., a
nonprofit firm in Holland, Pa., claims to have a data base on
"problem" financial planners that is "infinitely better" than
the ones operated by the states, since it pools information
the states generate with information from "law enforcement
agencies and investigating bodies" in the fields of
accounting, banking, insurance and securities.
   But when asked how the database gets its information, its
founder, financial planner William Knegendorf, says that
financial planners around the country "mail in
newsclippings." He says the system has no computer ties to
any regulatory group, and so far follows only 35 states
closely. (A recent call to Financial Planning Resource's 900
number, to inquire about a firm that has been included in the
states' CRD system since last spring, drew a blank.) "We
don't claim to be perfect," says Mr. Knegendorf.
   Investors who aren't satisfied with the databases at their
disposal, however, can often find out a lot on their own. One
of the best places to start is by checking the references and
credentials of one's financial adviser.
   That's what 83-year-old Florida investor Hobart C. Reid
did. Last June, he says, a broker with Group America, an
Agoura Hills, Calif., firm that sells commodities over the
phone, persuaded him to invest $30,000 in Swiss francs and
Deutsche marks.
   But after he invested, Mr. Reid, a retired graphic artist,
had second thoughts. He called Delaware Trust, the bank his
broker said was holding the currencies. When bank officials
told him they did no business with Group America, Mr. Reid
says he called his broker at Group America, who told him that
a "mistake" had been made. Mr. Reid then received a document
that indicated that his investment was being held by Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co.
   Mr. Reid says he felt reassured by this, but decided to
check with Merrill Lynch anyway. He gave the document he
received to a Merrill Lynch broker, who forwarded it to
internal investigators in New York. Merrill says it found
that Group America did not have a connection to Merrill.
   Mr. Reid says he then got a call from Bill Whitely, Group
America's president. "They said would I be satisfied if I got
my money back. I said heck yes. They sent it Federal
Express."
   Mr. Whitely of Group America says that the reference to
Merrill Lynch on the statement sent to Mr. Reid was a
computer mistake.
   Regulators say Mr. Reid's investigatory tenacity may have
helped him in his getting his money back. "Squeaky wheels --
they pay off," says Bill McDonald, assistant commissioner of
the California Department of Corporations. Still, he adds,
referring to Mr. Reid, it's better if investors do the
checkups before they invest.

   WASHINGTON -- Sharon Pratt Dixon, a former Democratic
National Committee treasurer, won the Democratic primary for
mayor of the District of Columbia, topping a field of five
contenders.
   Ms. Dixon is running to succeed Marion Barry, whose plans
to seek a fourth term were cut short by his widely publicized
trial and conviction on a misdemeanor cocaine-possession
charge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Dixon, 46 years old, faces former Police Chief Maurice
Turner, a 55-year-old Republican, and a handful of other
candidates in the November election. Ms. Dixon, who trailed
her rivals throughout the primary, now enters the fall
campaign as the favorite in a city where Democrats outnumber
Republicans 8-1. Ms. Dixon surged in the final days of the
campaign on the strength of a surprise endorsement by the
Washington Post and a strong anti-incumbent message.
   Former Carter administration civil rights official Eleanor
Holmes Norton overcame last-minute disclosures that she
hadn't filed local tax returns to win the Democratic
nomination for the city's nonvoting delegate seat in
Congress. She said her husband was responsible for family
finances and neglected to tell her. She faces Harry
Singleton, a former Reagan administration official. The
winner will succeed Walter Fauntroy, a longtime civil rights
activist who gave up a seat he had held for 19 years to run
for mayor.
   And the Rev. Jesse Jackson, in his first bid for local
office, won one of two unpaid positions as a "shadow" senator
to lobby for statehood for the district.
   In Connecticut, Rep. Bruce Morrison won a close race for
the Democratic nomination for governor. He will face former
Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker, who is running as an
independent, and the GOP nominee, Rep. John Rowland, who had
no primary opposition.
   In New Hampshire, Gov. Judd Gregg was nominated for a
second term as governor. He will face state Democratic Party
Chairman Joseph Grandmaison, who won a close race against
state Senate Minority Leader Robert Preston.

   Pampering Motorists Proves Profitable

   Entrepreneurs are finding there is no end of ways to make
money exploiting the American motorist's yearning to be
pampered.
   The nation that orders power windows as readily as a
Frenchman orders croissants will pay almost anything for
automotive convenience, business owners say. With today's
two-career families, even people who aren't lazy don't have
time to take the car to the garage to have the windows
tinted.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Businesses that take these problems off the motorist's
shoulders are proliferating. A-Action Mobile Window Tinting
Inc., Orlando, Fla., will tint car windows with plastic film
in the customer's driveway. A Massachusetts firm offers oil
changes and tire checks while customers are vacationing. A
New York discount broker will negotiate the price of a new
car. And for people who find confrontations taxing, a
"counselor" at a car-repair hot line will ask the local
garage some hard questions about that $800 job it is
proposing.
   Entrepreneurs find the demand is huge. "There is nothing
people hate more than going into a car dealer's," says Seth
Furst, owner of Auto Consumers Inc. of New York. "They want
to drive their kids to the Little League game or a birthday
party on a Saturday afternoon, not talk to some guy in a
polyester suit and stained tie."
   So his clients, who he says have included fashion
photographer Bruce Weber and actor Tom Cruise, tell him what
new car they want, and he does the haggling. He also advises
them against certain models and extras (notably rust-proofing
contracts). He says he handles about 1,000 sales a year.
   Mr. Furst considers himself something of a psychologist.
He talked one woman, who had moved to Connecticut from
Manhattan and become pregnant with her first child, out of
buying a Volvo station wagon. He figured she was playing an
unaccustomed role of suburban housewife and steered her
toward an Acura Legend, which he considers "more reliable."
   Another consultant for car buyers, Stan Madeloff, founder
of Jenlor Co. of Canton, Mass., used to recruit and train
personnel for car dealerships but "switched sides" about five
years ago. Today, he says, his mission is to fend off
"surprises and exorbitant overcharges" for consumers. He
recalls the desperate phone call he got from a young man.
"The kid was in tears," he says. "Three people {at a
dealership} had been working on him for 1 1/2 hours in a back
room. They wouldn't let him leave."
   Car/Puter International Corp. of Dania, Fla., helps people
buy cars, too, but doesn't do the negotiating. It furnishes
computerized printouts with pricing information -- including
the price dealers pay and the latest rebates and financial
incentives -- on any make of car. Buyers who can't wait can
get "instant pricing" through a 900 telephone number.
   A recent Car/Puter innovation holds vast pampering
potential: car repair hot lines. On the hot lines, some 30
"counselors" help diagnose cars' mechanical problems. They
will also "talk to your mechanic to make sure the price isn't
out of line," says Alan Schein, Car/Puter's vice president.
An auto-pricing hot line estimates the best prices for used
cars and, for buyers, arranges inspections. A
government-auction hot line gives dates and locations of
public sales. "We try to take the mystery out" of the
automobile business, says Arnold Wonsever, the company's
president.
   Other services have other gimmicks. Oilco, formed this
year in Braintree, Mass., sends equipped vans to parking lots
to do lubrications, change oil and filters, inspect motor
fluids, replace worn filters, wipers and lights, and adjust
the tire pressure.
   "There's no waiting in line, no taking time off from
work," exults John Cozzi, a marketing consultant who is
helping to set up the company. He is about to add two vans to
the single one now operating and is putting together a $2
million financing package to increase the fleet to 30. He
predicts the service will "change the automotive habits of
the U.S."
   Already, Oilco services 15 manufacturing companies. It
says it expects to sign contracts shortly with a group of
Boston parking garages and a department-store chain, and it
is contacting cruise lines, airports, office buildings,
supermarkets and other owners or managers of parking lots.
While customers of these companies buy groceries or cruise
the Caribbean, Oilco will be working on their cars. When they
return, they will find that Oilco employees have left an
apple on the dashboard and looped a thank-you note over the
rear-view mirror.
   Some companies that have long traveled to the customer are
finding new ways to pamper. Robert Turner, owner of Turner's
of Califon in Califon, N.J., got started by changing oil in
people's driveways. Now, he restores and repairs luxury and
antique cars, and his workers wear gloves to prevent smudging
as they transport vehicles to his shop in a special van. "I
get a lot of worried-father, `my-baby's-gone' type of thing
-- people who call every day to see how their car is," Mr.
Turner says.
   Entrepreneurs also find pampering opportunities in rental
cars. In Millburn, N.J., family-owned Instant Rent a Car
delivers cars to the curbs of clients' homes at a moment's
notice. "About half the people can't get here {to the
car-rental office} because their car is broken down, and
about half just don't want to," owner Dennis Pryor says. Such
a slothful attitude bothers him not at all. "If I was sitting
at home, I'd have a car delivered, too," he says.
   But rental pampering isn't limited to the cars themselves.
LapStop Corp. of Salem, Mass., rents lap-top computers and
other equipment to Avis Inc. customers. The service, begun in
April at five airports, spares travelers the bother of
lugging their own machines on a plane.
   With so many small companies indulging one or another of a
motorist's wants, the opportunity looms for somebody to try
to satisfy all a car owner's driving desires. New York City's
AutoTech Center, an affiliate of privately held Garage
Management Corp., believes it has seized that chance. Its
goal is to spoil its customers rotten.
   Employees at its six-floor garage on Manhattan's posh
Upper East Side will pick up, park and deliver your car,
lease you a car and get special insurance discounts for it,
superclean your car in a "detailing salon" for $185, repair
your car, tint your car's windows, and sell and install
accoutrements in your car ranging from $4,500 leather seats
to cellular phones. Favored customers are even driven to
their workplace.
   "We don't have any competition," boasts Michael Glickman,
the president and a principal shareholder. "We're a one-stop
shop."

   K mart Looks to New Logo
   To Signify Broad Changes

   TROY, Mich. -- K mart Corp. plans to ditch its familiar
red and turquoise signs in favor of a new logo.
   Chairman Joseph Antonini acknowledged that changing a
symbol as well known as K mart's is risky because it could
alienate shoppers. But, he said, "We wanted to signify the
changes taking place inside the store. This is what we have
to do."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new logo, which will appear in ads as well as signs at
all 2,231 K mart stores by 1995, features a big red "K." The
word "mart" is written in smaller white script inside the K.
It was designed by Anspach, Grossman, Portugal Inc., New
York.
   Retailing and image consultants have contended for some
time that the old logo conveyed the impression that K mart
hadn't changed much since its early discounting days in the
1960s, when it attracted shoppers with low-priced light
bulbs, hangers and other odds and ends. Nowadays, K mart
sells more stylish apparel and home goods. And it just
embarked on a massive $2.3 billion store renovation program
to enlarge its outlets, widen aisles and improve its
displays.
   Mr. Antonini defended the logo change. "Our research
showed you could do anything you wanted with the mart," he
said, "but don't lose that big red K."

   Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, a French auto maker,
said AB Volvo of Sweden joined in its bid for a stake in the
Czechoslovak auto maker Skoda. Last February, Renault and
Volvo signed a cross-share-holding pact, which is pending.
   Recent speculation in business circles placed French
state-owned Renault ahead of rival bidders Volkswagen AG of
West Germany and General Motors Corp. of Detroit in the
contest for a large, possibly controlling interest in
state-run Skoda, which plans to become a joint stock company
by the end of October. A spokesman for Renault said it
expects a decision from the Czechoslovak government by
October.

   Skoda produces nearly 200,000 vehicles a year and earns
$100 million annually in hard currency -- the third-largest

210,000 shares, in its Societe de Mecanique d'Irigny S.A.
steering assembly unit to Koyo Seiko of Japan for about 100

   Nissan's Hopes
   In U.S. Market
   Ride on Sentra

   SMYRNA, Tenn. -- Nissan Motor Co., which has won acclaim
for such performance cars as the sleek Maxima sedan and the
Porsche-like 300ZX, now is pinning its hopes for a U.S.
market resurgence on a subcompact priced to sell for less
than $10,000.
   Nissan yesterday unveiled its new 1991 Sentra at the
monstrous 3.4 million-square-foot factory near Nashville,
Tenn., that assembles the car, as well as compact pickup
trucks. The new Sentra has smooth, flowing lines and a much
peppier engine than the 1990 model. Nissan clearly needs to
build back Sentra sales to regain market share in the long
term.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The Sentra is the absolute key to us penetrating the
market," says Wallace Lowenfield, a Nissan dealer in El Paso,
Texas. "We could sell more Sentras than the rest of our car
lines put together."
   Nissan sure needs something hot. Its archrivals, Toyota
Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., are surging ahead in the
U.S. market, and both now have market shares exceeding 9%.
But Nissan's once-promising bid for a comeback from its sales
decline in the late 1980s has stalled. The company took just
4.8% of U.S. car sales in the first eight months of this
year, down from 5.2% in the same period a year ago. The
biggest reason: Sentra sales were down more than 31% from a
year earlier.
   The problem isn't short-term. Nissan's overall U.S. sales
peaked at 831,000 cars and trucks in 1985. But last year,
sales totaled just 663,000 vehicles, and earlier this year,
the company pulled its Axxess minivan off the U.S. market
because it just wasn't selling.
   Now, Nissan says it wants to rebuild its U.S. sales to
900,000 vehicles by the mid-1990s. Another goal is to sell a
greater percentage of higher priced vehicles.
   But Nissan needs to boost sales of its lower-priced models
to keep up with its expanding U.S. production capacity.
Smyrna, which currently assembles 240,000 Sentras and pickup
trucks, will have the capacity to build another 200,000 cars
in two years, probably the next generation of the mid-priced
Stanza.
   The current Sentra, a boxy, undistinguished vehicle, has
needed a replacement for a couple of years, Nissan executives
concede. But Nissan decided three years ago to redo its
upscale "image" cars before tackling the big volume Sentra.
   "To us, those cars were much more critical to our image
and what we wanted to do to it," said Thomas Mignanelli, who
heads Nissan's U.S. sales and marketing arm. "So we
prioritized them in the product cycle and left the Sentra to
last."
   Now, Nissan will see if its new image -- painstakingly
built around its performance cars -- means anything when it
comes to selling the Sentra.
   Nissan is clearly gambling that it will. For starters,
there is the new Sentra's price. It starts at $7,999, a hefty
$600, or 8.1%, more than the current Sentra. And the heavy
incentives used to move the current Sentra won't be offered
on the new model, Mr. Mignanelli said. In effect, Nissan
officials want the Sentra to be perceived as an alternative
to such higher-priced subcompacts as the Honda Civic, instead
of vying for entry-level buyers against such low-priced
models as the Hyundai Excel.
   After incentives, buyers plunked down an average of $7,500
for the old Sentra, said Robert J. Thomas, general manager of
the company's U.S. Nissan division. Now Mr. Thomas wants to
move the average "transaction price" to between $8,500 and
$9,000.
   The big price jump has riled some dealers. Carmen Koosa,
who owns two Nissan dealerships in Southern California, said
the new Sentra will be a "tougher sell" because of the price
increase. Already, many potential Sentra buyers are having
trouble getting financing in today's tight credit market, he
said.
   However, many dealers and analysts say the new Sentra is
such an improvement from the old model that it will do well
despite the price increase.
   "Nissan won't have to have the fire sales on it the way
they have on the old Sentra," says analyst Paul J. Fraker of
Baring Securities Inc.
   Still, Nissan is setting modest sales goals for the new
Sentra, at least for the next year or so. The company expects
to sell 175,000 to 180,000 Sentras in the 1990 model year
that ends Sept. 30, and roughly the same number in the 1991
model year. But Nissan expects Sentra sales to pick up
substantially in the 1992 model year that begins in the fall
of next year, Mr. Mignanelli said.
   During the same period, Nissan will be trying to rev up
sales of its new Stanza compact, which is positioned between
the Sentra and the Maxima in size and price.
   The big decline in Sentra sales this year has been
accentuated by some deliberate actions on Nissan's part,
according to Mr. Thomas. Nissan purposely kept Sentra
inventories lean so that the new Sentra won't sit on the same
showroom with a lot of old Sentras. It was this problem that
plagued the launch of Ford Motor Co.'s Escort budget car
earlier this year. "The difference between us and Ford is
that we've cleared out our '90s," Mr. Thomas said.
   The Sentra isn't the only Nissan car having market
troubles this year. The sporty 240SX was a big hit when
introduced two years ago, but sales are down 25% so far this
year. Nissan is countering that by introducing a restyled
240SX with a bumperless nose.
   Sales of the pricey 300ZX sports car have dropped 18% so
far this year. Nissan has responded by coming out with a
cheaper version of the car without a T-bar roof; it will
start at $27,300, $1,300 less than the cheapest 1990 model.
   The one Nissan car that has shown strong sales gains is
the year-old Stanza. Through August, Nissan had sold 54,481
Stanzas, about twice as many as in the same period a year
earlier. Stanza sales took off earlier this year when Nissan
started an unusual marketing campaign offering $100 to
anybody who test drove a Stanza and then bought a Honda
Accord or Toyota Camry.

   NEW YORK -- GTE Airfone Inc. signed an agreement with
Communications Satellite Corp. to carry Airfone's
aircraft-based phone traffic internationally by mid-1991.
   The move by the GTE Corp. unit comes as rival
international phone services such as British Airways Skyphone
and Aeronautical Radio Inc. have been formed to challenge
Airfone's position in the fledgling aircraft phone service
business.
</LP>

   "Our customers . . . require the availability of global
communications while inflight from anywhere in the world,"
said Mark S. Schneider, Airfone's marketing vice president.
   Airfone will use the satellite ground stations in
Southbury, Conn. and Santa Paula, Calif., that are operated
by Comsat Aeronautical Services, a unit of Comstat, which is
based in Washington. The network also will have data-carrying
capability.
   In addition, Comsat will arrange for additional global
links through the satellite system operated by the
International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat).
   Airfone, which began operations in 1984, has installed
air-to-ground phones in more than 1,300 aircraft or about a
third of the U.S. airlines' domestic fleet. Airfone also
operates Railfone, a public phone service on Amtrak trains.
In April, the Federal Communications Commission formally
established aircraft phones as a regular communications
service and opened the field to potential competitors. GTE
has been trying to block from the business one of those
rivals, In-Flight Phone, which was founded by Airfone's
creator John D. Goeken. Their squabble is now in the courts.

   WASHINGTON -- The current lull in saber rattling may
obscure it, but President Bush is likely to face a stark
decision sometime this fall over whether to use a military
strike to oust Iraq from Kuwait.
   Barring unexpected developments, the Bush administration
now intends to sit tight without making big policy changes
for at least the next several weeks, senior administration
aides say. During that period, the White House will wait to
see whether economic sanctions are really squeezing Iraq, and
the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf will be
completed as shiploads of big tanks arrive.
</LP>

   Then, at some point in October or November, Mr. Bush and
his top aides are likely to sit down together to decide
whether sanctions are inflicting enough pain to force Iraq to
reverse course in Kuwait. If the embargo is seriously
pinching Iraq, the president probably would choose to stay on
his current course awhile longer. And officials insist that
they are optimistic about the sanctions, despite new hints
that Iran may help Iraq circumvent them.
   But there's another scenario that may be more likely: If
the trade embargo is leaking, or if it appears that the
sanctions will take too long to have a real impact, President
Bush will face the question of whether a military strike is
necessary to achieve his unambiguous goal of driving Iraq out
of Kuwait.
   With no meaningful diplomatic efforts under way to find
another course of action, and no certainty that sanctions
alone will do the trick, the odds remain high that,
eventually, the current crisis will turn to war. Rep. David
Obey (D., Wis.), head of the House's foreign-operations
subcommittee, recently returned from a trip to the Persian
Gulf and said he saw "a far better than 50-50 chance" of
fighting.
   Administration officials will talk only vaguely about
their precise timetable for such decisions. "What we'll be
watching for over the next few weeks are signs that the
sanctions are in fact biting," says a senior administration
official. "If they are having an effect, then clearly that's
a guide to future action." Another U.S. policy maker says he
"wouldn't be surprised if by another month we had more
indications than we have now."
   Because of the administration's current focus on
sanctions, Mr. Bush didn't explicitly threaten military
action in his nationally televised speech to Congress this
week, only saying elliptically that "all options" are being
considered. But a variety of signs indicate that while the
odds of a military conflict right now don't seem high, they
begin escalating starting in October and November.
   "My view is that we will continue on this track for the
next eight weeks," says Barry Rubin, an analyst at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who has closely
followed the evolution of U.S. policy since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. "By the time we get to Nov. 15 or
mid-December, there are a number of factors that come
together."
   By that time, as administration aides note, it will be
clearer whether sanctions are working. In addition, enough
time may have passed for the U.S. to argue credibly to the
world community, which it wants to keep united in opposition
to Iraq, that it has given economic and diplomatic pressures
ample time to work against Saddam Hussein.
   At the same time, U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf will have reached full strength. Despite the
rapid rise in the number of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, to
more than 100,000 today, they have lacked the large numbers
of tanks U.S. military commanders would want in any
full-fledged fight with Iraq. Those tanks arrive by
slow-moving ships.
   There also is the chance that if the confrontation with
Iraq isn't resolved by winter, U.S. public support and the
morale of troops camped in the Arabian desert may begin
eroding. That could push the administration to bring the
crisis to a head before then.
   In the fall, of course, Mr. Bush's decision making also
will be affected by a big domestic event: the Nov. 6
congressional and gubernatorial elections. If Mr. Bush were
to contemplate a decision as momentous and politically dicey
as an attack on Iraqi troops, he might want to wait until
after the election has passed. (Some Democrats, on the other
hand, are beginning to worry that Mr. Bush may use an
"October surprise" military action to whip up a patriotic
fervor that would help his Republican Party in time for the
vote.)
   In any case, some analysts suggest that if Mr. Bush
reaches a point at which he concludes that economic sanctions
simply won't be enough, he should pause before turning to
military action and first deliver a clear ultimatum to Saddam
Hussein.
   Such a message would flatly warn that military action is
coming if Iraq doesn't move out of Kuwait within a week or
two. That kind of unambiguous warning might force Saddam
Hussein for the first time to seriously contemplate his fate
if he doesn't reverse his occupation of Kuwait. "The reason
to make it very clear that war is coming is to exhaust the
last chance that he will blink," says William Quandt, a
Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. "It may be
the case that the only way to get someone like Saddam Hussein
to look at the choices confronting him is to make war look
inevitable."
   It's also conceivable, of course, that if the U.S. reaches
a point where it concludes that economic sanctions won't be
enough, it could turn not to the military option but to more
serious negotiations with Saddam Hussein to find a
compromise. Arabs now supporting the tough U.S. stand also
could switch strategies and consider offering Iraq billions
of dollars and land concessions to withdraw from Kuwait.
   But such a course of action seems less and less likely as
Mr. Bush grows more and more definitive in his declarations
that Iraq will be forced to withdraw without any reward.
"Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately and
without condition," Mr. Bush said in his address to Congress
this week.
   Ironically, countries that might want to help Iraq now by
circumventing economic sanctions may actually be increasing
the prospects of war against Baghdad later, when the world
community concludes that sanctions won't produce enough
pressure. But at this point, administration officials insist
that they are pleasantly surprised by how well economic
sanctions are working. They say the flow of goods into Iraq
through neighboring Jordan has slowed to a trickle. And they
doubt that Iran will allow big quantities of food and goods
into Iraq, despite a call by its religious leader yesterday
for a holy war against the U.S. and reports from Tehran that
Iran may send food and medicine in return for refined
petroleum products.
   The question that Mr. Bush and his aides will face this
fall will be how long they can or will wait for sanctions to
have their full effect. "My own belief is that it may be
possible to get Saddam Hussein to withdraw unilaterally
without military action, but the question is whether we're
willing to wait that long," says Mr. Rubin.

   Swissair was dealt a blow in efforts to control costs when
the planned sale of its hotel unit, Swissotel AG, to the
Aoki/Westin Group of Japan fell through.
   The national airline, 23%-owned by Swiss federal and
cantonal authorities, signed a letter of intent in March to
sell its interests in 16 luxury hotels to the Japanese
construction and hotel group that owns Westin Hotels &amp;
Resorts of the U.S. Swissair cited "uncertainty in world
financial markets" and the complexities of the deal for the
sale's collapse.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts had valued Swissotel at as much as 750 million
Swiss francs ($565 million).
   An airline spokeswoman said the strengthening Swiss franc
against the yen and the dollar made Swissotel more expensive
for Aoki. Further, there were difficulties in financing the
four U.S. hotels in the chain, she said.
   Swissair in March said it wanted to sell the unit because
substantial investment would be required to develop Swissotel
into a viable international chain.

   LOS ANGELES -- A federal bankruptcy judge approved the
sale of $42.4 million in assets by Qintex Entertainment Inc.,
which filed for bankruptcy protection last October, to RHI
Entertainment Inc.
   When Qintex also completes the sale of about $20 million
in interests in HR Broadcasting Inc., an owner of television
stations, it will have completed the transition to a shell
company with about $100 million in tax benefits. Los
Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp., bondholders and other
creditors are awaiting a reorganization plan, but Qintex had
wanted to make the sale before the value of the assets
declined, said company president Jonathan D. Lloyd.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The assets acquired by RHI Entertainment, a closely held
New York television production concern bankrolled by New Line
Cinema Corp. and Chemical Bank, includes the Qintex film and
television library, which contains among other properties the
miniseries "Lonesome Dove" and the Laurel and Hardy films.
They also include about $25 million in accounts receivable
and $10 million in cash.
   Qintex Entertainment is 43% owned by Qintex Australia, a
unit Brisbane-based Qintex Ltd., which made a $1.5 billion
bid to acquire MGM/UA Communications Co. last year. The deal
collapsed. The assets sale is still subject to more court
approvals but Qintex said it expected the transaction to be

   Milacron, Last Big Heavy Robots Maker
   In U.S., to Sell Line to Asea Brown Unit

   Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the last major American maker of
heavy robots, is quitting the business.
   The machine tool maker said it signed a letter of intent
to sell its robot business to ABB Robotics Inc., a unit of
Asea Brown Boveri AG, which is based in Zurich, Switzerland.
Milacron, of Cincinnati, said terms were being negotiated.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A company spokesman said the business represented less
than 10% of Milacron's total revenue of $850.6 million in
1989, and that the sale wouldn't have any material effect on
1990 earnings.
   Milacron's plan is to concentrate in three areas related
to basic manufacturing -- machine tools, plastics machinery
and consumable industrial products, such as grinding wheels
and fluids used in metal-cutting. The company, which has been
losing money in its robot business, recently sold units that
produced industrial lasers and wafers for semiconductors, for
instance.
   Milacron's withdrawal leaves most of the U.S. robot market
in the hands of foreign producers. The Japanese have been
especially aggressive competitors because their costs for
electronic components have been lower and they have had a
ready market in Japan; Manufacturers there have adopted
robotics much faster than U.S. companies.
   The largest robot supplier to the U.S. market is GMFanuc
Robotics Corp., Auburn Hills, Mich., a joint venture between
General Motors and Fanuc Ltd., a major Japanese producer of
robots and electronic controls. However, many of the robots
GMFanuc markets and installs are made by Fanuc in Japan.
   Asea Brown already is a factor in the U.S. robot business,
with facilities in New Berlin, Wis., and Rochester Hill,
Mich., that build robotic systems around robots produced in
Sweden. Asea plans to continue Milacron's business,
fulfilling current contracts and providing all customer
services including training and parts replacement, Milacron
said. Asea also intends to retain a substantial number of
Milacron employees, Milacron said.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Milacron yesterday fell 12.5 cents to $12.625.
   Milacron jumped into robots in 1977, a time when it
appeared that robots would replace humans in many repetitive
manufacturing jobs, ranging from loading and unloading
machine tools to final assembly and painting of the product.
   However, robot applications developed much more slowly
than Milacron expected; there usually was a cheaper way to
get the job done. The Robot Industry Association, Ann Arbor,
Mich., says U.S. robot shipments this year, including robots
manufactured abroad, may exceed $500 million, but that is
only a fraction of the market foreseen a decade ago.
   In recent years, Milacron chopped the size of its robot
operations, and concentrated production in a modern plant at
Greenwood, S.C. The primary product was spot welding
equipment, used mainly by the auto industry.
   Meanwhile, Japanese producers gradually took over much of
the U.S. market by selling lower-cost robots. Often they were
smaller and less versatile than Milacron's big, bright yellow
robots, but they did their particular job at a lower cost.
   Milacron officials complain that some Japanese competitors
"look at a robot as a shipping container for six electric
motors, six drives and a bunch of electronic controls," all
of which the Japanese could make more cheaply than U.S.
companies. In addition, Japanese manufacturers adopted
robotics more quickly than did most U.S. manufacturers, which
gave Japanese robot companies a bigger domestic sales base
and the efficiency gained from high volume production.
   Eli Lustgarten, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said he
was "sad but not surprised," by Milacron's move. "They went
into robotics with tremendous hopes but weren't able to earn
satisfactory profits." Mr. Lustgarten noted that in the past
decade "half the Fortune 50 companies were fooling with
robots, companies from Westinghouse Electric Corp. to General
Electric Co. and United Technologies Inc." But the gross
margins weren't sufficient to support the technology
investments needed, he said.
   Some small U.S. players remain. Graco Robotics, a unit of
Graco Inc., based in Golden Valley, Minn., for example, makes
robots for spray painting. There are dozens of other small
U.S. producers that make robots for specialized applications.

   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. hopes to boost sales to
charge-card customers by offering cash certificates that can
be applied to future purchases.
   The retailing and financial services concern, struggling
to reverse years of sagging earnings, is introducing the
"frequent shopper" program in time for the Christmas season.
With a recession looming, executives also hope the program
will increase their store's appeal to cautious consumers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It won't be tremendously significant, but it will be a
plus," said Laurence Cudmore, Sears retail president.
   But others aren't so sure. "I don't see it as a real
strong incentive" for shoppers, said Kurt Peters, editor of a
trade publication called Credit Card News.
   The reason: Sears is offering customers who accumulate at
least $200 in purchases on their cards certificates valued at
1% of those purchases. The average Sears charge-card customer
spends $300 to $400 a year, meaning a bonus of $3 or $4.
   Mr. Cudmore acknowledged that the bonus doesn't seem
substantial. But he said when the program was tested in
Baltimore and Pittsburgh, Sears found "a very definite
difference in performance (at stores in the pilot program)
versus the control stores."
   He declined to estimate how much the program might cost
Sears. Sears has 40 million charge-card accounts, but it
considers only 26 million of them active. A spokeswoman said
the bonus club, which starts Saturday, could help Sears
attract customers who haven't shopped its stores in a while.

about 46.8 million Australian dollars (US$38.2 million).
   Butte is offering two new Butte common 10-pence shares for
every three shares of Vam and four new Butte common 10-pence
shares for each Perseverance share outstanding. At exchange
rates last Thursday, the offer values each Vam common share
at 23.1 cents, which values the whole company at A$26.5
million. It values Perseverance shares at A$1.39 each and the
company at A$20.3 million.

   Vam owns about 49% of Perseverance. An associate of Butte
has agreed to accept Butte's offer for its 16.5% of Vam,
entitling Butte to that stake. Butte doesn't have any
entitlement to Perseverance shares.
   Vam and Perseverance had combined gold production of about
35,000 ounces in the fiscal year ended June 30. They are
forecast to reach an aggregate annualized level of 65,000
ounces by mid-1991.

   PONTIAC, Mich. -- Mazda Motor Corp. launched its Navajo
sport-utility vehicle, the first vehicle made by a Big Three
U.S. auto maker to be sold in the U.S. by a Japanese company.
   The Navajo is a two-door version of Ford Motor Co.'s
popular Explorer sport-utility vehicle. Ford builds the
Navajo, Mazda's first sport-utility vehicle, at the same
assembly plant in Louisville, Ky., that produces the Ford
Explorer introduced earlier this year. Ford owns 25% of
Mazda, and the two companies have extensive product
development alliances.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mazda set the base price for the Navajo at $17,560. The
auto maker projects annual Navajo sales in a range of 15,000
to 20,000 vehicles. The Navajo is only available in a
two-door; the Ford Explorer is offered in both two-and-four
door models.
   Mazda this week began its television advertising campaign
for its 1991 vehicles, including the new Navajo
sport-utility. Footage for the television commercials was
shot in Ship Rock, N.M., "in the heart of Navajo lands," said
Clark Vitulli, chief operating officer of Mazda Motor of
America Inc. "The television creative builds on the strong
Navajo name and the heritage and imagery it implies," he
said.
   Mazda features North American Indians in the advertising
campaign but says it won't make any mention that the Navajo
sport-utility is American-made, Vitulli said. "I don't think
people care where it was manufactured or where it came from,"
he said.
   Mazda also said it will raise base prices of some its 1991
models by less than 1% to 4.5% from 1990 levels. Mazda didn't
increase the base price of its popular Miata two-seater,
leaving it at $13,800. But it raised the starting price of
its cheapest car, the 1991 Mazda 323 hatchback, by 4.5% to
$6,899 from $6,599.
   The Protege compact sedan base price was raised to
$10,999, or 4.3% from $10,549 a year ago. Mazda said it
upgraded the interior and exterior trim and replaced an
entry-level model in the Protege line-up.

   Stanford Is Facing
   Inquiries on Alleged
   Overcharging of U.S.
   ----
   University and Government
   Are Investigating Charges
   Of Padded Overhead Bills

<LP>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Has one of the nation's most
prestigious universities been cheating Uncle Sam out of
millions of dollars in research money?
   Stanford University disclosed it was investigating that
and other concerns in the wake of charges by a federal
official that the school may have submitted "false" and
"fraudulent" claims for various overhead charges related to
research projects bankrolled at the university by the federal
government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stanford said the Office of the Chief of Naval Research
was reviewing whether the government made a "significant
overpayment" to the university for overhead costs. That
inquiry, Stanford said, apparently stemmed from a March 6
report by a campus-based representative of the agency who
alleged that Stanford officials may have engaged in
"fraudulent acts" and made "false claims" in its billing
practices, including "excessive library cost reimbursement"
amounting to $30 million to $40 million from 1983 to 1986.
   The full amount of any overbilling or wrongdoing wasn't
given in the report, which Stanford itself released. The
campus representative, Paul Biddle, declined comment,
referring calls to Pentagon officials, who couldn't be
reached.
   An arm of the Pentagon, the naval research office is the
federal agency with which Stanford negotiates overhead rates
that it charges for all federal research projects. Stanford
received some $400 million in research money in the 1988-89
academic year, the latest figures available, and, like most
major research institutions, most of that came from the
federal government. It is considered among the top two or
three recipients of federal research money among U.S.
universities. About $91 million of that figure reflected
overhead costs, which are charges for such things as use of
facilities, maintenance and utility expenses.
   Stanford officials said its internal audit of the
situation is due to be completed by Sept. 28. In a statement,
Stanford president Donald Kennedy said the fact that the
overhead issue was being scrutinized wasn't unusual. He said
the Stanford officials responsible for calculating overhead
"enjoy excellent reputations in their professions and
widespread confidence here at Stanford," and said the
university was eager to cooperate with the inquiry.
   Overhead charges, also known as indirect costs, have been
the subject of much debate in academic circles, amid federal
budget austerity and declining support for university
research in general. Many university administrators claim
that major funding sources such as the government have failed
to pay their fair share of such costs in recent times. Some
grant recipients, meanwhile, have complained that bloated
university bureaucracies and ambitious campus building
programs have taken a bite out of outside funds that would
otherwise have been directly available for their research.
   Last month, U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) asked the
General Accounting Office to review federal contracting
procedures with an eye towards examining escalating overhead
rates at major universities, including Stanford.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Gardening:
   For Happy Gardenias, Drink More Coffee

   Brooklyn, N.Y. -- I am a gardenia "appassionata," having
been smit at birth by a whiff of Gardenia jasminoides in my
native Hawaii. Ever since departing my first garden there, I
have tried to lead a gardenia-accessible life. It has not
been easy.
   Over the years, in sundry overheated, undersunned New York
City caves, I have killed scores of gardenias. After each
gardeniacide I would wait a decent interval and then, ever
the Sisyphean gardener, buy another. I would cart it home in
full bud, Proustily expectant of the first redolent waft of
benzyl acetate-styrolyl acetatelinalool-linalyl
acetate-terpineol-methyl anthranilate-Gardenia Absolute.
Within days the fat green buds would yellow, brownoff and
drop off: The gardenia would drop dead.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   During the '80s I tried self-help in re gardenias. I
consulted Thalassa Cruso's "Making Things Grow." Ms. Cruso
began by aspersion: Gardenias behave like "temperamental
prima donnas" and "only children." She continued by
confession: "I am one of those people who can do nothing with
gardenias." Then, after declaring "advice about gardenias
indoors is very hard to give," she gave her best: "I don't
think a novice should spend money buying such a tricky
plant."
   Regardless, I pushed on to T.H. Everett, the New York
Botanical Garden's late horticultural sachem. He turned out
to be an unmitigated gardenia disparagist. In his epic "NYBG
Illustrated Encyclopedia of Horticulture" (1981), Mr. Everett
dismissed gardenias peremptorily: "They are not good
houseplants. Their environmental requirements are too
exacting"; they will "deteriorate and eventually die."
Liberty Hyde Bailey, in his "Standard Cyclopedia of
Horticulture" (1933), wrote that despite the gardenia's
mid-19th-century rep as "one of the finest stove shrubs in
cultivation . . . it is one of the most difficult plants to
handle."
   Whenever I get really desperate for plant info I call the
Bronx and ask for Lothian Lynas. A crack English research
librarian, Mrs. Lynas is the New York Botanical Garden
Library's Miss Marples. So I called her about gardenias.
Exactly who was the gardenia's Alexander Garden? Besides
Billie Holiday, who wore them in her hair so much they became
her trademark, was there an American angle to the gardenia?
Within the hour Mrs. Lynas phoned with the particulars on Dr.
Garden (1730-91): Scotland-born physician; 30 years resident
in Charleston, S.C.; went back to Britain in 1782 upon
confiscation of his newly American property, he having
remained an English Loyalist during the Revolution;
naturalist; fellow of the Royal Society; friend and
correspondent of naturalist John Ellis. Ellis and Garden both
corresponded with the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus and
each petitioned Linnaeus to name a plant for the other. Mrs.
Lynas reported, "Some miserable little plant -- Ellisia
nycetelea -- got named for Ellis, while the gardenia went on
to glory." The American angle, pre-Lady Day's jazz
immortalization of the flower as camouflage for a cigarette
burn in her hair, Mrs. Lynas related, was that in 1760
Linnaeus had grudgingly bestowed Alexander Garden's name on a
deliriously fragrant plant recently introduced to England
from the Far East, while Dr. Garden was still resident in
colonial America. Linnaeus groused that by calling a gardenia
a gardenia he was "sacrificing science for friendship," and
peeved, "I cannot but forsee that this measure will be
exposed to much censure," considering "the ill-natured
objections, often made against me, that I name plants after
my friends, who have not publicly contributed to the
advancement of science." Mrs. Lynas noted that Dr. Garden
certainly had not contributed to the advancement of gardenia
cultural science. Of two gardenias sent Dr. Garden in 1762,
one was DOA and the other died within a year. A despondent
Dr. Garden wrote Ellis that the gardenia's "sudden death I
take to be no good omen for the continuance and duration of
my botanical name and character."
   Mrs. Lynas invited me up to vet the NYBG's Gardenia File,
a folder filled with many not altogether good-natured
objections to the gardenia's captious character by all manner
of garden griot. "A most cantankerous house plant . . .
Gardenias can make the most secure gardener nervous" (Linda
Yang). "A more finicky flower couldn't have been found"
(Tovah Martin). "I might as well warn you right now that
gardenias . . . are mean plants to handle" (Anonymous). "The
world's most frustrating house plants . . . finicky and
fractious in a living room" (Jeanne Goode). Indeed, Ms.
Goode's gardenia, "a plant that is almost always suffering,"
sounds like a real plant martyr. "More symptoms of distress
can appear on a gardenia in a week than most plants display
in a lifetime. These plants rebel in most houses."
Furthermore, "gardenias are intolerant of mistakes and resent
change." So who'd want to live with one? "There are no
remedies, just things you can do wrong." Clearly I was
unsuited to the gardenia's conservative and imperious
lifestyle. Aside from the standard admonitions to keep up
"atmospheric humidity" ("gardenias grow best in a
rain-forest-type climate") and acidity ("applications of
sulfur") and recommendations for "good, hard syringing" with
"plain water," no gardenia sage advised anything beyond what
I was already doing, or offered much hope of placating the
plants.
   My gardenia enlightenment happened two years ago, on the
day another of my plants gave up the gardenia ghost. A good
gardenia-growing friend from high-rise Manhattan, Edith
Chang, dropped off her gardenias for the summer in my
Brooklyn garden. Quite emphatically she declared that what
gardenias really need is to drop acid fairly often. Mind you,
not just the occasional hit of Miracid, but everyday
breakfast acid: COFFEE GROUNDS] At the time I was trying to
kick the coffee habit. For the sake of my gardenia futures I
now had good reason not to. Instead, I began mixing a morning
slurry of Italian dark roast espresso grounds and using it to
top off the daily gardenia watering with an acid chaser. (At
the same time I made rain-forest-sure that the cachepot
beneath each gardenia held at least 1 1/2 inches of plain
water for daylong pseudo-tropical humidification and soil
moisturizing.)
   I also became an obsessive pest inspector, joining
battalions of ladybugs, green lacewings and praying mantises
on routine patrol of the plants for scale, mealy bug and red
spider mite -- pests that love gardenias as much as I do.
(Lacewings and mantises even like to lay their eggs on
gardenias.) The only other gardenia requisites seemed to be a
bright, sunny indoor winter pot spot and five months'
summering al fresco. (Even the New York City out-of-doors
tones up the plants fast.) Two weeks of fresh-air camp and
the gardenias are flush with buds and shiny new leaves.
   Coffee grounds have made the critical difference in my
relations with these notoriously difficult plants. I haven't
offed a gardenia since 1988. Which makes me wonder why coffee
is never suggested in gardenia-coddling instructions. Could
it be fear of some obscure botanical incest taboo? Both
gardenia and coffee are members of the "Rubiaceae" family,
subfamily "Cinchonoideae."
   My java jive to other gardenia placators: Do not hesitate
to ply the gardenia with the grounds of its near relation,
"Coffea." Share the extended family acidity. By the strength
of strong coffee grounds I've brought two gardenias back from
the brink, nourished one scrawny three-inch mail-order
cutting to flourishing stoveshrub size, and rehabilitated one
massive mealy bug-mauled plant. In the NYC rain forest this
summer, the gardenias of Gotham have performed spectacularly.
I have not been a day without gardenias since May]
   Elvin McDonald of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden once
observed: "So many writers have cast an aura of mystery about
the gardenia and its culture that gardeners sometimes lose
all common sense handling the plant." He admonished:
"Approached calmly, gardenia culture is not any more
complicated than that of such common plants as the African
violet, begonia and geranium." Happily becalmed amid my
gardenias I might add: Gardenias are easy to grow given an
acid enough approach.

   Kansas Power &amp; Light Co. is the previously unidentified
third party negotiating to rescue Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co.
from an $857 million hostile bid from another local utility,
according to people familiar with the situation.
   However, the same people said the talks between the two
utilities haven't progressed very far.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   They and some takeover stock traders theorized that
disclosure of the talks late Tuesday by the target, Kansas
Gas &amp; Electric, may have been aimed at getting the first
bidder, Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co., to increase its
$27-a-share offer.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Kansas Gas &amp; Electric's stock rose $1.25 to $25.75
in response to its disclosure after the market closed Tuesday
that it has begun acquisition talks with an unidentified
third party.
   Yesterday, Kansas City Power &amp; Light, based in Kansas
City, Mo., asked to be given "equal opportunity with other
parties" to negotiate an acquisition of Wichita-based Kansas
Gas. Kansas Power &amp; Light is based in Topeka.
   One reason some traders were skeptical about Kansas
Power's chances of acquiring Kansas Gas is that Kansas Power
carries a somewhat smaller stock-market value than Kansas
Gas. "You've got an $800 million company trying to buy a $1
billion one," said one.
   Officials at Kansas G&amp;E and Kansas P&amp;L couldn't be reached
to comment late yesterday.

   A Republican President, George Bush, and a U.S. Congress
controlled by Democrats stood together Wednesday night. For
those of us who have watched U.S. foreign policy degrade over
25 years into a recent condition of almost reflexive,
corrosive partisanship -- from Vietnam through the trial of
Oliver North -- Wednesday evening's display of solidarity was
extraordinary. In replying to the President's speech, House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt said, "Here at home, a sense
of unity and the absence of widespread opposition to this
action in the Persian Gulf, testify to our powerful,
instinctive feeling that this is a cause worth standing and
fighting for." Similar sentiments suffused Mr. Gephardt's
speech.
   It is no doubt possible to explain Mr. Gephardt's remarks
in terms of normal political calculation. American troops are
in the Gulf and at risk, and it is late in the day to start
carping about the President's actions. Congressional
elections are two months off. However, it is also possible
that those of us who get paid to chronicle the daily mayhem
of Washington's picaresque world sometimes are liable to miss
the larger turns in the political temper.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Vermont Royster, this paper's former editor and its
historical memory, called us from North Carolina yesterday to
suggest that just such a turn may have taken place on
America's television screens Wednesday night. Mr. Royster
said the atmosphere of the evening drew to mind memories of
December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor, when President
Roosevelt went before Congress to seek a declaration of war
against Japan. The Senate voted it unanimously and the House
by 388 to 1, thereby putting to rest the deep political
divisions of the previous decade over the question of
American isolationism from the world's troubles.
   As in our time, with the War Powers Resolution and the
Nicaraguan-directed Boland amendments, Congress in the 1930s
passed a series of Neutrality Acts to circumscribe the
President's freedom to act in foreign affairs. Predictably,
these legislative interventions proved to be clumsy and
unwieldy instruments. Each made the formation and execution
of American policy difficult. Some welcomed that result. But
America's allies surely did not, instead seeing these
seemingly endless tensions as a formula for uncertain and
incoherent U.S. policy.
   It of course remains to be seen whether the current
entente on foreign policy is lasting. A new defense bill will
soon be debated by the Congress, and even in the midst of
this historic moment there is no assurance that the
Democratic leadership can prevent defense from being
irrationally pulled apart by the party's left wing or the
usual pork barrelers. Yet there is reason to hope that a
workable bipartisan coherence on foreign affairs may yet
develop.
   The Bush administration's recurring reference to the need
to create a new, civilized world order in the wake of the
Cold War found its echo in Mr. Gephardt's remarks: "We can
see beyond the present shadows of war in the Middle East to a
new world order where the strong work together to deter and
stop aggression. This was precisely Franklin Roosevelt's and
Winston Churchill's vision for peace for the postwar period."
   If indeed Republicans and Democrats are ready to turn the
page on more than two decades of acrimony in U.S. foreign
policy, the world's movement toward Roosevelt's and
Churchill's vision, interrupted at its creation for more than
40 years, may commence again. We shall see.

   Rise 13.12 Points

   NEW YORK -- Investors shrugged off potentially unsettling
Middle East news and pushed stock prices higher in a
last-minute rally.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.12 points
higher at 2625.74. Volume was light most of the day but
picked up in the final hour. Bond prices edged lower in
continued light trading. The dollar hit a 13-month low
against the yen but was higher against the mark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stocks' late surge, said Christopher Pedersen, director of
trading at Twenty-First Securities, was sparked by a news
service report about an Egyptian news story asserting that
Saddam Hussein is increasingly vulnerable to ouster by Iraqi
dissidents. "That gave us a nice little belt," Mr. Pedersen
said.
   While the pickup in volume as prices rose was encouraging,
Mr. Pedersen said: "There's generally no positive news and no
expectation of positive news on the horizon. There's no
reason to buy," which means sellers have a hard time getting
out at desirable prices.
   Oil prices remained relatively stable through the day,
despite news items -- such as Iran echoing Iraq's call for a
holy war -- that might have been expected to send prices
jumping. Mr. Pedersen said he believes the stock market is
priced assuming $30-a-barrel oil. Now investors are shifting
their focus to what emerges from budget deficit-cutting talks
in Washington -- especially regarding higher taxes.
   The Iran holy war news did affect the bond market,
however. "Were Iran suddenly to become a military ally of
Iraq, the Gulf forces there would need someone guarding their
back," said Ward McCarthy, of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates in Princeton, N.J. Partially offsetting that
influence were "faint notes of optimism" for a
deficit-reduction pact to be reached soon, Mr. McCarthy said.
   John Mendelson, a money manager at L.P. Cook &amp; Co., said,
"The feeling among investors is that another rabbit is about
to be pulled out of the hat in Washington," and the Federal
Reserve will respond by easing interest rates.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose. Volume was 129.9 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 778 to 638.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell 1/8 of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000
of face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond rose to 8.94%.

   $287 Million

   Settlement Ends Dispute
   Of Royalties Due State
   From North Slope Oil

   LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. said it agreed to
pay Alaska $287 million to settle a 13-year dispute over
royalties due the state from Arco's Alaskan North Slope oil
production.
   The settlement will result in a third-quarter charge of
about $25 million. A large reserve that covers most of the
settlement amount along with other potential liabilities was
set up piecemeal over many years, Arco said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said the charge will have a negligible impact on
third-quarter profit and may be offset by one-time gains,
including a previously announced $300 million legal
settlement with Southern Natural Gas Co. In the year-earlier
quarter, Arco earned $379 million, or $2.19 a share, on
revenue of $3.71 billion.
   The settlement agreement includes an approach for
calculating future oil royalties on most of Arco's current
North Slope leases. "This methodology is intended to reduce
the potential for future conflict," said William E. Wade Jr.,
vice chairman of Arco Alaska Inc., an Arco unit.
   Alaska Governor Steve Cowper said the settlement "marks
the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the state
and Arco which will mean a more amicable payment system and
which also will lead to increased development on the North
Slope."
   Arco said the settlement resolves all major claims
involving its North Slope oil production that were raised by
Alaska State in a 1977 lawsuit, including charges of
negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied covenants of
good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty.
   "The settlement is fair and isn't an admission of
wrongdoing on our part," an Arco spokesman said.
   The company said that 11 other North Slope oil producers
were originally named in the suit, including Chevron U.S.A.,
a unit of Chevron Corp.; BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. and
Standard Alaska Production Co., units of British Petroleum
Inc.; Exxon Corp.; Louisiana Land &amp; Exploration Co.; Mobil
Corp.; FMP Operating Co., a unit of Freeport-McMoran Inc.;
Marathon Oil Co., a unit of USX Corp.; Getty Oil Co., a unit
of Texaco Inc., and Phillips Petroleum Co.
   Amerada Hess Corp. settled in December with a $319,000
payment, the state said.
   Alaska has been seeking a total of about $902 million from
the oil producers, including $320 million from Arco in
royalties and interest for the period June 1977 through
November 1986. The $287 million settlement encompasses
production through February of this year, Arco said.
   "The settlement is a positive in that it eliminates
uncertainty," said L. Eugene Nowack, an analyst at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. He expects Arco to record one-time gains
of roughly $190 million in the third quarter and a slight
increase in operating profit.
   In a strong market for oil stocks, Arco shares rose $2.375
to $138.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   BTR PLC, one of Britain's largest industrial
conglomerates, reported a 6.6% rise in pretax profit for the
first half of the year and said it would issue one free bonus
warrant for every 15 shares held.
   The profit before tax of #530 million ($984.7 million),
from #497 million a year earlier, was at the lower end of
market forecasts, which ranged from #525 million to #550
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   BTR set the exercise price of the warrants at 370 pence.
If all the warrants are exercised in the allowed periods in
1994 and 1995, they would add 116 million shares to the
company's current 1.75 billion ordinary shares in circulation
and raise #429 million in capital.
   Profit after tax, less minorities, rose 6.7% to #302
million from #283 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings
improved 5.5% to 17.4 pence from 16.5 pence.
   Net profit attributable to shareholders, however, fell
7.9% to #302 million from #328 million. BTR didn't report any
extraordinary items in the half-year, although in the
previous period the company had a #45 million extraordinary
gain from the proceeds of its sale of National Tyre, a tire
and car replacement parts distributor, for #140 million.
   Sales were up 2.5% to #3.47 billion from #3.39 billion.

   Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC is planning to sell some
assets and may renegotiate the terms of its recent agreement
to buy three U.S. supermarket tabloids.
   In London, Robert Maxwell, chairman, told Maxwell
Communications' annual meeting that the company is in talks
to sell some of its "non-strategic businesses." He said
"negotiations are well advanced in a number of transactions
which we expect to complete very shortly" but declined to be
any more specific.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, executives of Globe International Publishing
Inc. of Montreal confirmed that Maxwell's plans to buy three
of its supermarket tabloids have been delayed. In May,
Maxwell announced plans to acquire the Globe, National
Examiner and Sun from Globe International for an estimated
$100 million. The tabloids would make Mr. Maxwell an instant
powerhouse at lucrative supermarket checkout stands.
   Peter Rubenovitch, Globe's chief financial officer,
wouldn't comment on negotiations, except to say they are
continuing. "Yes, the timetable has changed," said Mr.
Rubenovitch. "We planned to close within a month or two, but
that was too ambitious." Although he declined to elaborate,
Mr. Maxwell is said to have missed two closing deadlines. He
is also attempting to renegotiate the purchase price to below
$100 million, according to people familiar with the talks.
   At the annual meeting in London, Mr. Maxwell said his
company would repay about $400 million in short-term debt by
Oct. 23. "We do not enjoy being a highly leveraged business,"
Mr. Maxwell said. The company is "determined" to bring down
its level of debt as quickly as possible. Maxwell shares
closed up a penny at 167 pence on the London Stock Exchange.
Mr. Maxwell and other company officials couldn't be reached
after the meeting.
   Globe executives said Mr. Maxwell recently visited the
Globe's publication headquarters in Boca Raton, Fla., where
Globe executives expected to finalize the transaction.
Instead, they said, Mr. Maxwell said he needed to knock down
the price.
   Mr. Maxwell, through his privately held Mirror Group PLC,
publishes the London Daily Mirror, the second-largest
newspaper in Britain, and recently launched the European, an
English-language newspaper for Europe.
   His biggest U.S. acquisition to date was the $2.6 billion
purchase in 1988 of Macmillan Inc. Mr. Maxwell has hinted at
more U.S. acquisitions without giving details. In June, at
the annual meeting of one of his companies, Berlitz
International Inc., in New York, Mr. Maxwell said he was
negotiating to purchase a U.S. newspaper. He said that he was
"interested" in Tribune Co.'s high-circulation but marginally
profitable New York Daily News but that no negotiations had
been held. The Chicago Sun-Times was also rumored as a
possible target, but its owners denied negotiating with Mr.
Maxwell.

World War II signed a treaty giving their blessing to the
united Germany scheduled to come into being Oct. 3.
   The treaty, which concludes seven months of bargaining,
provides that the World War II allies -- the U.S., the Soviet
Union, Britain and France -- will restore to Germany the full
sovereignty it lost in 1945. The united Germany will be in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but no non-German
NATO forces will be stationed permanently on the territory of
the former East German state.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The treaty also declares that the united Germany "has no
territorial claims whatsoever against other states" and "will
never disturb the peaceful relations between nations."
   The seven-page treaty was made possible by a side
agreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union. Under
it, Bonn will provide billions of dollars in aid to Moscow
and help build housing in the U.S.S.R. for the nearly 400,000
Soviet troops that will leave German territory by the end of
1994 as a result of the German unity treaty.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told Soviet reporters
the German aid will total nearly $10 billion. The figure was
worked out in the past few days, after Moscow unexpectedly
raised its financial demands sharply.
   Now that the unity treaty is signed, the two Germanys can
proceed as planned with a separate internal pact and declare
themselves a single state.
   Two important issues related to the new treaty remain
unresolved. Secretary of State James Baker will continue
negotiating with Soviet officials today over a Soviet demand
that the U.S. separately agree to limit its troop deployments
in Europe to well below 100,000, compared with more than
300,000 now. Mr. Baker also is negotiating with Senate
leaders about whether the unity pact will have to be ratified
by the Senate.
   Under the treaty, Germany will limit its armed forces to
370,000 troops, down from nearly 500,000 now, and it pledges
never to acquire nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
United Germany also will sign a treaty with Poland
guaranteeing their current border.
   The treaty erases the military and political arrangements
put in place after World War II, and it formally eliminates
Soviet control established by Joseph Stalin over East
Germany.
   Mr. Gorbachev presided over the treaty signing at a hotel
built for Communist Party leaders here. He was praised for
encouraging reforms in East Germany and allowing the opening
of the Berlin Wall. "We have drawn the line under World War
II," declared Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
"We are now dealing with a new Germany that has drawn its
lessons from history."
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said,
"This is a day of joy and jubilation," but he also recalled
the victims of Nazi Germany. "In this hour, we remember the
victims of war and totalitarian domination," he said. "We are
particularly thinking about the Jewish people. We would not
want their agony to ever be repeated."
   For his part, Secretary Baker hailed "the plain, ordinary
people who breached the wall and tore asunder the Iron
Curtain."
   Last-minute disputes were still being resolved two hours
before the signing. Mr. Baker was awakened in the middle of
the night when Mr. Genscher appeared at his hotel to iron out
language covering NATO troops on German soil.
   In the pact, the Soviet Union agreed to let Germany decide
when and how U.S. and other NATO troops based in the
country's western half can "deploy" temporarily to the
eastern half for maneuvers. Germany pledged to protect Soviet
war monuments, to consult Moscow about honoring East German
contracts and to bar Nazism.
   The pact calls for total Soviet withdrawal from Germany
over four years, but it allows the U.S. to keep as many
troops on German soil as Washington and Bonn jointly want. An
earlier, separate agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union, which permitted each side 195,000 troops in central
Europe, has been junked as obsolete in light of the Soviet
exit.
   Moscow privately has been pressing Washington to declare
publicly a new unilateral U.S. troop ceiling of well below
100,000. But the U.S. has resisted, wanting to keep a free
hand and telling Moscow that Congress won't permit as many as
195,000 U.S. troops in Central Europe anyway.
   Still, the Soviets want such a limit on U.S. troops to
quell political concerns here over a separate conventional
arms-control treaty, which would cut each side's arsenal of
tanks, artillery pieces and other weapons. Mr. Baker will
discuss the matter today with Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr.
Gorbachev. The Bush administration is still debating what to
do.
   At Soviet insistence, the U.S. agreed to call the German
unity pact a "treaty," rather than giving it the less august
title of "agreement." But the administration still argues
that the pact needn't be ratified by the Senate. Senate
leaders disagree, and Mr. Baker spent time on the telephone
to Capitol Hill trying to iron out the issue.
   Because ratification in each nation takes time, the formal
termination of the World War II victors' rights and full
restoration of German sovereignty could be delayed past the
Oct. 3 unification date.
   To avoid that delay, the four allies agreed to sign a
separate agreement in New York Oct. 1 suspending their legal
rights over Germany. As a result, the nation will be fully
sovereign when it unifies Oct. 3, even before the allied
rights are terminated.

   British Aerospace PLC said pretax profit for the first six
months eased 0.7% to #146 million ($270.8 million) from #147
million a year earlier.
   The results, which matched market expectations, were
damped by a #28 million charge related to a prolonged
industrial dispute at the aerospace division of British
Aerospace, which is one of the country's largest industrial
concerns with interests in auto making and property
development.

   Profit after taxes and minority interests, or net profit
attributable to shareholders, was unchanged at #102 million.
Earnings per share eased 0.3% to 35.6 pence from 35.7 pence.
Despite the flat earnings performance, the company said it
will boost its interim dividend to 8.9 pence a share, up 9.9%
from the 8.1 pence paid in the year-earlier first half.
   Sales climbed 20% to #4.79 billion from #4 billion a year
earlier.
   The company said cost-reduction programs helped profit
margins in several divisions, including both commercial
aircraft and defense equipment.

   FAA to Block Plans

   FORT WORTH -- American Airlines said it sued the Federal
Aviation Administration to block an agency decision yesterday
that would allow rival United Airlines to change certain
flight schedules at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
   The suit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington, is the latest development in a running spat
between the two carriers over schedules at O'Hare, one of the
nation's busiest airports. The two carriers and affiliated
commuter lines account for 80% of the traffic there.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last month, American was granted a temporary restraining
order barring United from publishing new schedules for that
airport. A hearing is set for Sept. 17. In its latest suit,
American said, the appeals court ordered filings by both
sides by Sept. 19. American is a unit of AMR Corp.; United is
a unit of UAL Corp.
   The latest round was kicked off yesterday when the FAA
announced it was authorizing United to move certain evening
flights away from time periods into which American had
recently moved flights. The FAA said United's changes would
reduce anticipated delays and air traffic controller
workloads in those periods. The authorization would take
effect Oct. 1 and expire Jan. 15, 1991.
   The seeds of the scrap were planted last March, when
American and United at the behest of the FAA agreed to accept
certain scheduling restrictions to reduce congestion at
O'Hare. In June, American told the FAA that it was
withdrawing from the arrangement because it was suffering
competitively and was rescheduling some evening flights
within the flexibility allowed under its official "slots." A
"slot" is an assigned block of time in which an aircraft is
supposed to arrive or depart.
   United then proposed moving some of its flights, but to
times not included in its formal "slots," which triggered
American's opposition. American said the new times would give
United an unfair competitive edge.

   Congress: No Tiger on the Hill, Just a Lil' Old Pussycat

CONGRESS (CNG)
EXECUTIVE (EXE)
</GV>
<LP>
   Our text for today will be taken not from the showdown in
the Arabian desert, but from a consideration of that vaulting
masterpiece of prescient phrasemongering, "the imperial
Congress."
   Anyone who reads regularly from the offerings on the
opposite page -- as we all do -- knows that most of
Washington's problems at home and abroad can be traced to the
excessive ambitions and constitutional excesses of a Congress
gone mad with power lust. It is an interesting conceit, once
more beloved of liberals than conservatives, but its day of
even limited credibility was shorter than the test with
Saddam Hussein now promises to be. These days, rather than
being a ravening wolf straining at a dangerously frayed
leash, Congress repeatedly proves itself to be a neutered
pussycat, aiming for nothing higher than comfortable
longevity in the warm environs of Capitol Hill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That, to repeat, is not what you will learn from reading
the Journal's editorials or even the offerings of more
balanced observers. But what we think we know from reading
here, there and (it occasionally seems) everywhere, and what
is actually true, are often two different things. This is one
of those cases.
   The record is quite clear. Across a decade in which two
administrations regularly complained about congressional
encroachment on executive prerogatives, Congress was about as
intrusive as a leaf. It lighted here and lighted there, but
for most of the time it blew first in one direction and then
another, barely staying put long enough to make an impression
of any kind.
   What venture in fact did Congress deter, impede or
destroy? Certainly not Mr. Reagan's foreign-policy forays,
whether in Central America or Asia. Obviously not his
domestic initiatives, the most important of which were as
regularly endorsed as they regularly assaulted cherished
Democratic Party positions. While a Bush presidency, achieved
without a policy mandate, was expected to provide Congress
with the wherewithal for a reassertion of influence, the
truth is that Congress has been no less disinclined to
confront George Bush than Ronald Reagan.
   "Bring on the wimp," some of the congressional tigers were
roaring 20 months ago. But the "wimp" turned out to have a
whip, his popularity, and Congress has rarely ventured out of
its cage. Rather than an imperial Congress, this has been an
invisible Congress.
   Do we have a budget crisis? Is the savings-and-loan
disaster directly traceable to Washington? Has the economic
separation of rich and poor in the U.S. taken on Third World
proportions? Has the president sent American forces into open
combat three times in 10 years without serious congressional
check and no prior congressional approval? Is even the
largest military expedition since the Vietnam War judged to
lie outside the bounds of congressional review, criticism or
formal approval?
   The answer is always the same: yes. This Congress has not
even demanded that the president ask for the fig leaf of a
Tonkin Gulf resolution -- a fig leaf, I would add, that is
not nearly as emphatic an endorsement of his Middle East
venture as it deserves. The problem is not that in this
instance that Congress should be opposing the president but
that in this instance, as in so many in recent years,
Congress has proved to be simply irrelevant.
   There is something altogether fitting in the symbolism
inherent in a budget summit between Congress and president at
an Air Force base. The commander-in-chief summons and the
Congress mumbles. God forbid that it should take the bit in
its teeth and offer a tough alternative to the policies that
have brought the government to bankruptcy and the nation to
both bankruptcy-recession and inflation. A trim here, a slide
there and a lot of winks all around, and you've got the
"budget package," which is offered as a meaningful answer to
a sea of red ink and a boxful of unmet national needs.
   It is not true that Congress can do nothing well. It can
separate petitioners from their money with remarkable
dexterity. What PACs, corporations, true believers and
concerned citizens spend to help perpetuate this gutless
Congress in office sets records every year. They get
something individually for their money, which ranges from
satisfaction at their candidate's re-election to influence on
his vote. What the nation gets is a clutch of House and
Senate members who check their convictions at the door. Money
is mother's milk, and mother calls the tune.
   Is your name Charlie Keating and you have a problem with
savings-and-loan regulators? Call on the Democratic whip in
the Senate and a few other concerned senators. Are you a
farmer afraid that Congress might face facts and impose
sanctions on Iraq, thereby cutting off one of your lucrative
markets? Well, right up to the day before the invasion of
Kuwait, count on the Republican Senate leader to be in your
corner.
   Congress is a pride of special-interest shills posing as
public-policy lions. It does not take a presidential giant to
still their querulous complaints. A man of quite ordinary
stature appears large when standing among pygmies. This
Congress is imperial only when it comes to the structures it
builds for itself. In all other respects, its goals are as
modest as its vision, courage and convictions.

   NEW YORK -- Corna &amp; Co., a Columbus, Ohio, securities
firm, agreed to be expelled from the National Association of
Securities Dealers, and its owner was barred from the
industry as regulators charged them with 20 violations of
securities laws and rules, including stock parking.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the firm and
David A. Corna consented to the sanctions imposed by the
securities industry's self-regulatory agency. The NASD also
fined the firm $100,000 and Mr. Corna, of Dublin, Ohio,
$150,000. Corna &amp; Co. was the subject of eight prior
disciplinary actions, the NASD said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Corna was unavailable for comment.
   The main charge in the NASD's disciplinary complaint is
that Corna &amp; Co. executed a stock-parking scheme to conceal a
lack of sufficient capital to conduct a securities business.
Parking securities involves placing them with another entity
to conceal their true ownership and reclaiming them later.
   In Corna &amp; Co.'s case, the NASD said that in February and
March 1988, the firm sold short the stock of First World
Cheese Inc., a Maplewood, N.J., cheese marketer.
   Short sales are effectively bets that a stock's price will
decline. However, First World's stock jumped in price. The
NASD charged that Corna suffered more than $200,000 of losses
on the short sales, and as a result was at least $100,000
below net capital requirements for seven months.
   The NASD charged that instead of ceasing business, as
federal law requires, Corna &amp; Co. placed its short positions
with 19 different customer accounts, hiding its net-capital
deficiency.
   The agency also charged Mr. Corna with creating two
fictitious customer accounts, which allegedly defrauded the
firm through which Corna &amp; Co. cleared its business. And the
agency charged Mr. Corna with forging the signatures of
several customers and former employees on various documents.
   First World Cheese wasn't charged with any wrongdoing.

   In his Aug. 15 Rule of Law column relating to problems for
Roger and Juliana Pilon, Gordon Crovitz, referring to Michael
Shaheen, the Justice Department ethics chief, suggests Mr.
Shaheen may have issued an erroneous report on the Pilons. He
states, "If Mr. Shaheen issued the annual report despite
knowledge that Mr. Pilon had been cleared, this might be a
case of J. Edgar Shaheen. Mr. Shaheen has been the only
director of the post-Watergate ethics office, which was
formed in 1976. Longevity may breed a dangerous insularity."
   Perhaps Mr. Crovitz's "J. Edgar Shaheen" reference was to
the fact that J. Edgar Hoover was a longtime director of the
FBI. However, the unfortunate sentence structure implies that
Mr. Hoover, too, issued false reports on individuals. I am
not aware of any such charges made about Mr. Hoover.

   EAST GERMANY'S ACTIVE `MOLES'

   East Germany fired 30 former secret police agents from
official posts after learning that thousands may be working
in the government, officials said.
   Up to 6,000 agents of the old Communist security police
reportedly still occupy important posts in East German
government and industry three weeks before unification. Der
Morgen, an East German daily, said 65 "moles" of the Stasi
state-security apparatus, formally abolished in December,
still worked in the Interior Ministry, which oversees a
committee in charge of Stasi's breakup.
   East German officials acknowledged on Tuesday some
government ministries were still riddled with Stasi moles
infiltrated in the 1980s but offered no figures.
   Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel conceded that the
man he appointed to oversee the Stasi-dissolution committee
turned out to be a Stasi mole himself and was fired. Der
Morgen accused Mr. Diestel of laxness in rooting out Stasi
agents from his ministry.
                                                                                                       

   ANOTHER SOVIET SHORTAGE: INK
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Union's national newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda
reported that the country is down to just two or three weeks'
supply of printer's ink. "It's entirely possible that in a
short time, presses for newspapers, passports and rubles will
come to a halt," the article said. Sergei Galkin of the state
Printing Committee told the newspaper that Western suppliers
of printer's ink haven't been paid for their last shipment
and refuse to send any more on credit. He said he needs $12
million to $17 million before he can replenish supplies.
                                                                                                       

   DAIHATSU'S ITALIAN PROJECT

   Japan's Daihatsu Motor Co. has reached an agreement with
Carrozzeria Bertone S.p.A to supply major parts for a
four-wheel-drive car to be sold under the Italian company's
name in Europe. Daihatsu will ship the body and steering
systems for its Rocky model to Bertone, which will complete
the vehicles with engines built by BMW, Daihatsu said.
Bertone and Daihatsu will turn out about 10,000 units a year,
beginning in 1992. The new car, called the Feroza, will be
marketed by Daihatsu dealers.
                                                                                                       

   EXECUTIONS IN CHINA
                                                                                                       

   China has executed more than 500 people this year in its
biggest crackdown on crime since 1983, Amnesty International
said. The London-based human rights group said the executions
were carried out by firing squads after courts were ordered
to "clean up crime" before the Asian Games in Beijing later
this month. "Those executed are among the 1,100 people we
know have been sentenced to death in the past 12 months,"
Amnesty said. "And while that number is high, it is only the
tip of the iceberg."

   The thrill-seeking sport of bungee jumping was banned in
the Australian state of New South Wales pending review of an
accident that injured the former Miss Australia and an
experienced jumper. Natalie McCurry, whose reign as Miss
Australia ended Monday, suffered a broken collarbone when a
cord came free as she and the other jumper, Andy Gulby,
plunged 130 feet from a cage suspended by a crane off
Sydney's Birkenhead Point.

   Chinese and Soviet officials yesterday completed a railway
line spanning the border in remote western China, the
official Xinhua news agency reported. Xinhua said the
285-mile link would enable passengers to ride by rail from
the eastern Chinese port of Lianyungang through the Soviet
Union and East Europe to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The
total distance is 6,700 miles.
                                                                                                       

   SLUGGISH CARS IN EUROPE
                                                                                                       

   Europe's new-car sales in July rose 5.4% to 991,381 from
940,836 a year earlier, but fell 2% from 1,102,060 in June,
amid continuing signs of sluggishness for the auto industry.
   The July decline from the previous month was largely
attributed to the seasonal fall in British car sales. Sales
traditionally slump ahead of August, the start of the new
license-registration year. Excluding Britain, where
month-to-month sales fell 68%, European car sales rose 8.8%
to 945,674 from 869,363 in June.
   But analysts said they see no reason to alter full-year
forecasts ranging from flat auto sales to a 2% decline. Their
forecasts are linked to the growth in the gross domestic
product of European economies. GDP growth now is slowing from
4% in 1989 to about 2% for 1991, one analyst estimates.
   A 21% year-to-year rise in West German car sales helped
buoy the European market overall. Since monetary union July
1, the used-car market in West Germany has come under a siege
of buying from East Germans; as the number of used cars has
diminished, more buyers have had to turn to new cars.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Spain's national carrier Iberia will begin direct flights
between Madrid and Berlin, with a stopover in Barcelona, on
Oct. 28. Iberia passengers flying to Berlin currently must
make connecting flights at Vienna, Amsterdam, Brussels,
Athens or Rome. . . . The 100th anniversary of the founding
of Fort Salisbury, now the Zimbabwean capital Harare, went
uncelebrated yesterday. Asked if any ceremonies were planned
for the centennial, a city official said, "What do you mean?
You want us to celebrate colonialism?"

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Jonathan D. Krane wowed Wall
Street three years ago when he announced the creation of a
1930s-style Hollywood studio with a 1980s twist.
   The charismatic attorney said he would make quality
low-budget movies driven by the "passion" of directors,
writers and actors whose careers the company also managed,
including John Travolta and Mr. Krane's wife, Sally
Kellerman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Management Company Entertainment Group Inc. raised more
than $120 million and became a hot stock last year after
producing the box-office hit "Look Who's Talking," starring
Mr. Travolta. Flattering articles about the MCEG and its
chief appeared in magazines and newspapers.
   But Mr. Krane, 38 years old, has recently inspired more
enmity than passion in Hollywood. The company is in default
on more than $100 million of debt to major creditors,
including the GE Capital unit of General Electric Co., and it
owes money to scores in Hollywood.
   Director Nicolas Roeg and two other creditors have taken
legal steps to force MCEG's movie unit into liquidation, and
today is the deadline for the company's response. MCEG, which
is frantically trying to recruit investors, has told Mr.
Roeg's attorney that it plans to ask for more time in a
federal bankruptcy court hearing today.
   More than 100 employees have been fired, leaving a staff
of fewer than 25 at headquarters here. Many of the departed
have harsh words for Mr. Krane. "Look up the word
`megalomaniac' in the dictionary and his picture is there,"
says Alan Lasoff, a former MCEG talent manager. "Jonathan is
mean, nasty and hateful," adds Andrew Milner, a former MCEG
senior vice president.
   At a time when major studios are making movies with big
stars and budgets over $50 million, Mr. Krane tried to make
movies for $5 million and under, using lesser-knowns. With
such low budgets, he said, all his movies would be profitable
through the sale of distribution rights overseas and to home
video.
   But Mr. Krane has turned out to be more skilled at issuing
positive press releases than in running a studio. He
announced many more movies than he made, and most of those he
released were disappointments in the U.S. and elsewhere.
"Look Who's Talking," the one box-office hit, was produced by
MCEG for Tri-Star Pictures Inc. What Mr. Krane didn't reveal
in press interviews was that while the movie has taken in
$283 million, MCEG's share has been less than $2 million.
   Mr. Krane did succeed in keeping film costs low, but in
the process a lot of directors, producers and vendors simply
weren't paid; many have filed lawsuits. Meanwhile, Mr. Krane
created huge overhead through rapid expansion into
distribution and even film financing.
   Despite the unpaid bills, Mr. Krane spent like a mogul. He
flew MGM Grand Air, the luxury airline, so many times that
his secretary received a free ticket. He drives a black
Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible, at a leasing cost to the
company of $30,689 last year.
   And, like a mogul, he made the films he wanted to make.
Hollywood executives joked that it was "The Sally Kellerman
Company" after Mr. Krane cast his wife, who is 53, as a femme
fatale in "Boris and Natasha," a $3.6 million movie, so far
unreleased.
   "It was a charismatic organization that was able to borrow
money. But they were morons with checkbooks," says Rick
Endelson, a former production controller of the company's
movie unit.
   Mr. Krane agreed to an initial interview for this article
and said he would be available for additional interviews.
However, he didn't return subsequent phone calls. Henley
Saltzburg, a lawyer for Mr. Krane, responded to a written
list of questions with this statement: "Since the information
and the allegations were unfounded and since the information
seemed to be obtained from disgruntled and former employees,
the questions will not be presented to Mr. Krane."
   A Michigan shareholder sued MCEG in state court here
charging that it misrepresented its financial condition to
inflate its stock price and give "the illusion of success."
The company denied the allegations, and the suit is pending.
The stock, which first traded at 62 1/2 cents and rose as
high as $4.375 last year, closed yesterday at 3 1/8 cents a
share (up 1/32 point) in over-the-counter trading.
   Mr. Krane blames the company's current state on his
co-founder, William J. Rouhana, 38, whom he fired four months
ago as vice chairman. "He was in charge of finance and
distribution. I basically relied on him," says Mr. Krane.
Says Mr. Rouhana: "As chairman and chief executive officer,
he was in charge."
   The roots of the company go back a decade to group therapy
sessions in Beverly Hills. Mr. Krane, the son of a Los
Angeles auto-leasing executive, had attended Yale law school
and later worked as a tax and film-finance attorney. His
entree into Hollywood came when he entered therapy and met
Ms. Kellerman and director Blake Edwards in the same group.
   He married Ms. Kellerman, who played Hot Lips Houlihan in
the 1970 movie "MASH," and co-founded an entertainment
company with Mr. Edwards in 1981. Mr. Edwards hoped Mr. Krane
could take that company public, say former associates.
   However, they say the two had an acrimonious parting after
Mr. Edwards discovered Mr. Krane instead had been working to
take his own company, MCEG, public. Mr. Edwards declines to
comment.
   Mr. Krane says the parting was amicable, adding, "I will
forever be indebted to him."
   After raising $9.2 million in a public offering in August
1987, MCEG bought Manson International, an international
distribution company, for about $4.9 million, providing a
source of revenue. Press releases flowed. In February 1988,
Mr. Krane announced a $50 million slate of 14 movies for
distribution that year. Just seven months later, he sounded
even more ambitious, announcing a total of 21 pictures valued
at $133 million.
   But MCEG released only one movie in 1988, despite having
put many more into production. It was "The Chocolate War," a
movie about a boys' school, written and directed by
actor-client Keith Gordon with a budget of just $750,000. Mr.
Krane produced three other movies that year, but one was
released only on video and two, produced for another company,
quickly disappeared. He now says the company has produced a
total of 10 films at an average cost of $2.7 million.
   Richard Martini wrote and directed "Limit Up," a $2.4
million movie about a commodity trader who trades her soul
for success. The movie opened and closed quickly last year,
as did "Catch Me If You Can," about a high-school class that
bets on car races.
   "He had an inability to see the product for what it was,"
contends Mr. Lasoff, the former talent manager. "He said we
were making more movies than anyone else, that we were making
`A' product at a fraction of the cost. The reality was we
were making `C' product at best."
   One product was "Boris and Natasha," a movie based on the
old TV cartoon characters. Mr. Krane cast his wife as Natasha
although many felt that Ms. Kellerman was too old for the
part. "I personally feel she was tremendously miscast," says
Joel Soisson, one of the film's producers. Mr. Krane
continued to rework the movie, adding a song by Ms.
Kellerman, but it has yet to be released.
   MCEG paid $7,330 for Ms. Kellerman's personal exercise
trainer, Mr. Soisson says. "There were a lot of costs that
were arguably not germane to the film," he adds. MCEG also
backed Ms. Kellerman's singing career, paying more than
$25,000 for a nightclub act, a voice trainer, musicians and
recording time, adds Mr. Endelson, the former production
controller. Ms. Kellerman declines comment.
   Mr. Krane's public face was that of a strict cost cutter.
He appeared on the set in his Rolls-Royce and asked, "Who's
complaining about {working} overtime? I want to know who it
is and I want them fired," recalls Mr. Soisson. "A lot of the
crew had total contempt for him and the production," he says.
   Some projects were delayed because of cash-flow problems.
While Mr. Krane hoped to cover production costs by selling
foreign rights, that market went sour.
   Mr. Milner, the senior vice president, was in London in
October 1988 on his way to a sales convention when a fax from
Mr. Krane was pushed under his hotel room door at 3 a.m. "I
have reviewed your numbers and they aren't high enough," Mr.
Krane wrote. "I insist you come back with sales on the six
pictures of $20 million." Mr. Milner says he brought sales on
those pictures to just over $4 million.
   Buyers also backed off as MCEG failed to deliver movies.
"Jonathan always said pre-sales covered production costs and
it was never true, with the exception of `The Chocolate
War,'" says Mr. Milner.
   Yet MCEG was still growing rapidly, acquiring many of the
elements of a major studio, such as domestic home video
distribution. The company hired a high-paid staff last year
to distribute its films in the U.S., a risky move that has
proven lethal to other independents. But there were few
movies ready to distribute and a small budget for promotion.
MCEG moved into a sprawling office here and Mr. Krane filled
it with art, including two paintings of dogs in business
suits.
   "The overhead skyrocketed," says Michael Lauer, a former
head of business affairs. "Krane wanted to have it all."
   MCEG's earnings looked good, at least initially. The
company reported net income of $693,079 for the fiscal nine
months ended Dec. 31, 1988. However, auditors challenged one
transaction, requiring the company to restate its
third-quarter earnings. MCEG then posted a net loss of $2.5
million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1989. Still, Mr.
Krane painted a rosy picture, saying that "unclear accounting
standards" had led the company to defer income on completed
movies.
   Wall Street was happy to provide more cash. Kidder Peabody
&amp; Co., a unit of General Electric, underwrote $27.5 million
in convertible debentures in January 1989. "Our firm belief
in MCEG allowed us to market the securities aggressively,"
Richard Intrator, a Kidder senior vice president, said in a
newsletter. Kidder later helped MCEG create a new security
backed by foreign film receivables, a move that raised
another $20 million. Kidder officials decline comment.
   As recently as last September, Kidder analyst Christopher
P. Dixon issued a buy recommendation, writing, "MCEG is
superbly positioned to benefit from the globalization of
American entertainment." Mr. Dixon didn't return calls for
comment.
   At the Cannes Film Festival in France in the spring of
1989, Mr. Krane and two other top officers stayed in suites
at the posh Hotel du Cap Eden Roc at a cost of about $20,000
each for the 10-day period. The company, which spent nearly
$1 million at the festival, gave a lavish party to promote a
lengthy list of movies.
   MCEG released only three films last year, all box-office
duds, including "Getting It Right," a British comedy that won
some positive reviews.
   Executives say Mr. Krane frequently screamed that MCEG was
his company and the movies were his movies. Staff members
recall that Mr. Krane twice held staff meetings at his home,
about 45 minutes from the office. They say he sat in a
high-back leather chair and kept his back turned to the group
throughout the meetings. "So," he asked with his hands behind
his head, "what's been going on?"
   Close associates say Mr. Krane suffers from Tourette
Syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes muscular
twitches and sometimes involuntary verbal sounds. While Mr.
Krane exhibited some of the symptoms, executives say he
rarely discussed the condition. Experts say the Syndrome
affects people differently; some have difficulty in
controlling impulsive behavior such as swearing and angry
outbursts.
   One executive who attended the staff meetings in his home
said Mr. Krane's behavior didn't appear to be related to
Tourette Syndrome.
   Former associates question Mr. Krane's role in paying more
than $40,000 to Eliza Simons, a casting director. While Ms.
Simons did work on movies, former executives believe she was
overpaid on certain projects. MCEG issued a check to Ms.
Simons for $10,000 for "casting services" on two movies the
company never made, "Uncle Bob" and "Late Knight." Ms. Simons
says she wasn't hired as a casting director on those movies
and did "very little work" on the projects.
   When asked about the check, she says, "I don't remember. I
was handling so many shows at the same time." Ms. Simons says
she has known Mr. Krane since she was 13. "He was my
boyfriend in camp," she says. "We held hands."
   The move that pushed MCEG toward the edge was the July
1989 acquisition of Virgin Vision Ltd., a British-based
international distribution company, for $83 million. Analysts
considered the deal overpriced and there were significant
unresolved legal questions about distribution rights. Before
the acquisition, both companies were suffering from cash-flow
problems. But Kidder Peabody rallied again, providing a
bridge loan of $67 million.
   Within a month, MCEG issued bonus checks to Mr. Krane and
Charles J. Weber, then president and chief operating officer,
for $200,000 and $150,000 respectively, on top of salaries of
$577,782 and $350,000. The payments outraged some other MCEG
executives, who say the board hadn't approved the payments.
   "The checks weren't written before the board approved it,"
Mr. Krane says. "Every procedure was followed." Yet the bonus
checks are dated Aug. 25 and the board didn't meet to approve
the bonuses until Nov. 12, company records show.
   Mr. Weber, who declines comment on the bonuses, resigned
after the board approval and says his departure was amicable.
   Insiders worried that the company was rudderless. In a
November letter to co-founder Mr. Rouhana, Colin Hurren, then
executive vice president, suggested forming an executive
committee. "We need a `counter weight,' a `balance' if you
will to the operational and management style of our
chairman," he wrote. "We must demonstrate that the ship is
being `steered.'" Mr. Hurren declines to comment on the
letter but says, "There were good executives who told the
emperor he wasn't wearing any clothes."
   That became clearer when MCEG went into default on the
Kidder Peabody bridge loan last December. Mr. Rouhana says
the lending climate made refinancing impossible. Losses
snowballed to $14.9 million for the nine months ended Dec.
31, 1989, and Kidder sold the problem loan to GE Capital as
part of a larger portfolio.
   MCEG still hasn't filed its financial statement for the
fiscal year ended March 31. "There were optimistic policies
with respect to the accounting," says Raymond Godfrey, the
current president and chief operating officer.
   Meanwhile, work on six movies has ground to a halt. The
company has released only one movie this year, "Without You
I'm Nothing," based on comedian Sandra Bernhard's
off-Broadway show, which the company also financed. The movie
was distributed by New Line Cinema Corp. as part of a
distribution agreement signed in May.
   Mr. Krane now is producing "Look Who's Talking Too," the
sequel, again for Tri-Star, a unit of Sony Corp. And Mr.
Travolta, the star, has remained a supporter. "He has been
the best thing that happened to my career in 10 years," the
actor says of Mr. Krane. "He's a great friend and he wants to
take care of you in a parental way."
   That isn't how some former employees feel. Several vented
their frustration on a papier-mache cow in MCEG's lobby. The
black-and-white cow, which is balanced on one leg atop a
magenta ball, was a gift from Ms. Kellerman to her husband.
At first, several executives just spit on the cow. But one
livid employee finally knocked it over and thrust a letter
opener into its side. "It's not funny," says Mr. Krane. "They
stabbed it."

   Bouygues S.A. said a unit has received a 20-year contract
valued at 2 billion French francs ($376.1 million) annually
to manage the Ivory Coast's electricity distribution system.
   The French construction and public works group said La
Saur S.A., which specializes in electricity distribution and
is one of the largest water management companies in France,
also agreed to invest about 100 million francs to update the
West African country's electricity network and pay debt
accrued by Cie. Ivoirienne d'Electricite.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The group said La Saur will request technical assistance
from Electricite de France International, a branch of the
French state-run electricity company.
   A Bouygues official said the contract grew out of the
Ivory Coast's need to supply the necessary expansion and
maintenance investments required in the electrical sector.
The country's population is projected to increase to 20
million by 2000 from about 14 million currently.
   The group said the contract will boost La Saur's annual
revenue to about 6 billion francs this year.

   Ratners Group PLC, the British retailer in the midst of a
takeover bid for Kay Jewelers Inc. of Alexandria, Va.,
reported a 37% plunge in pretax profit for the first six
months of the year.
   Britain's biggest jewelery chain said pretax profit fell
to #9.30 million ($17.3 million) from #14.7 million a year
earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest results, in line with market expectations,
suffer in the comparison because of a #7.4 million gain on
investments and property disposals in the 1989 period. There
were no such gains in the latest period.
   Ratner said that despite the slowdown in U.K. consumer
demand, the company is heading toward "the all-important
Christmas season with confidence."
   The $328 million bid for Kay, funded in large part through
a 1-for-4 rights issue, is expected to be completed before
the Christmas selling period, it said.

   U.S.-Soviet Plan
   For Plane Venture

   BRUSSELS -- Since the start of the year, negotiations have
been going on about the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet
passenger airplane venture.
   The little-known talks came to light when Mikhail
Gorbachev was asked by Soviet television what else he and
President Bush discussed, besides the Persian Gulf, at the
Helsinki summit last Sunday. The Soviet president mentioned
the airplane venture.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The planned project involves two Soviet aircraft design
bureaus, Ilyushin and Tupolev, Israel Aircraft Industries
Ltd., and the Pratt &amp; Whitney unit of United Technologies
Corp. The point man for this unlikely team is none other than
the original Russia hand, Armand Hammer, the 92-year-old
chairman and chief executive of Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   The plan is to take four-engined Ilyushin Il-96s and
twin-engined Tupolev Tu204s to Tel Aviv, where the Israeli
aerospace concern would outfit them with Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines, U.S. avionic systems and comfortable cabin
interiors. The planes then would be offered for sale
world-wide as cheaper alternatives to Airbus Industrie and
Boeing Co. aircraft.
   In a telephone interview yesterday, Dr. Hammer said he
would travel to Moscow next month and hopes to get a firm
contract from President Gorbachev so that a new company he
chairs, Aviation Venture International, can buy the Soviet
airplanes for refitting in Israel and export to the West. "I
have written Mr. Gorbachev about it and I have had
encouraging replies," he said.
   Dr. Hammer also said he met with President Bush three
weeks ago and discussed the plan. The president's reaction
was "very favorable," he said.
   These refitted-for-export jetliners, which are intended to
compete with the best that Airbus can build, would offer
airlines an alternative to the three big Western
manufacturers -- Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
-- which are nearly sold out for the next several years, Dr.
Hammer said. They could be flying by 1995 and would cost less
than competing Western models because of lower Soviet and
Israeli labor costs, he said.
   However, big problems could lie ahead. Aeroflot, the
Soviet Union's mammoth airline, itself needs nearly all of
the early production of both new models. Western
technology-transfer authorities may balk at letting sensitive
avionic systems go into Soviet-built airplanes. Aviation
specialists say the refitted planes would have to win
certification from exacting U.S. and European air-worthiness
authorities, a potentially large stumbling block. Finally,
they ask, who would supply after-sales support to airlines
that bought the planes?
   Israel Aircraft Industries is keeping mum on the subject.
A spokesman in Tel Aviv said the state-owned defense and
aerospace company won't be commenting until "there is a
logical opportunity with a strong profit potential." Israel
and the Soviet Union have no diplomatic relations. But Dr.
Hammer said the company has made five trips to the Soviet
aircraft factories this year and that, under orders from Mr.
Gorbachev, the Israelis were "shown everything."
   Aero-engine builder Pratt &amp; Whitney confirmed that it has
been in technical talks for the past several months with the
Ilyushin and Tupolev bureaus about fastening its PW2037
engine on their newest models. "We're pursuing it as a very
serious venture," says a spokesman. The PW2037 currently
flies on Boeing's twin-engined 757.
   Dr. Hammer said Aviation Venture International has raised
$2.5 million in startup money for the project from the likes
of British publisher Robert Maxwell, Canadian developer
Albert Reichmann and Israeli businessmen Shaul Eisenberg and
Al Schwimmer. He added that these investors hope to raise $50
million from banks or a public offering next April so that
Aviation Venture International can start buying planes,
engines and avionic systems. With firm orders from airlines,
the venture would then be able to raise more capital from the
public.
   Aerospace specialists are enthusiastic about the design of
the long-range Il-96 and the short- to medium-range Tu-204,
both of which are now undergoing flight tests and Soviet
certification. Both have the new "fly-by-wire" cockpit
technology pioneered for civil airliners by Airbus. But the
problem with the existing models, especially for export
prospects, is the engines, a technology in which the Soviets
trail.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney says there would be no problems fitting
its PW2037 on the two Soviet jetliners. The company has
gotten U.S. government clearance to talk to the Soviets about
the project, the spokesman said, but it hasn't yet received
export licenses for the engines.
   As for prospective buyers apart from Aeroflot, GPA Group
Ltd., the Irish airplane lessor, has said it likes the Tu-204
model and even has talked about buying some with Soviet
engines. No doubt with Western engines and cockpit equipment,
GPA would be even more interested. One GPA manager calls the
project "feasible."
   The concept of a joint airplane venture isn't entirely
new. Earlier this year, Ilyushin reportedly had talks with
Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain and other Western
aerospace companies about joint development of an export
model of Ilyushin's new, 60-seat Il-114 turboprop commuter
aircraft.
   And there is a precedent of sorts. Gulfstream Aerospace
Corp., a unit of Chrysler Corp., and the Sukhoi Design Bureau
have teamed up on plans for a supersonic business jet. The
two showed a model at the big Farnborough Air Show in Britain
earlier this month.
   The first international aerospace exhibition in the Soviet
Union is scheduled to open Sept. 21 in Moscow and interest
from the West is high. More than 200 exhibitors from 15
countries have signed up and 90 Soviet companies will be
represented. The U.S.-Soviet-Israeli project is expected to
be a hot topic at the show.

   Who's News:
   Bertram Lee Named to Reebok's Board
   Amid Black Group's Attack on Industry

   STOUGHTON, Mass. -- Reebok International Ltd. named
Bertram Lee, a black businessman who is chairman of the
Denver Nuggets basketball team, to its board.
   The action comes at a time when some black groups are
charging that the sneaker industry has profited hugely from
sales to black youths while having few blacks in upper
management and spending little money in the black community.
Operation Push, a Chicago-based civil rights group, has
started a boycott of shoes made by Nike Inc., Beaverton,
Ore., Reebok's archrival, demanding among other things that
it name a black person to its board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The industry has been coming under a lot of criticism
lately, and Reebok is trying to address some of the issues
raised by Operation Push," said Heidi Steinberg, a shoe
analyst with Salomon Bros.
   Mr. Lee, who has served on other boards, said he always
evaluates human rights when he considers whether to join a
board. Reebok "came through with flying colors," he said.
   He added that he hasn't had any contact with Operation
Push about the shoe companies, but he said he expects
Operation Push will evaluate Reebok at some point. Nike has
charged that Operation Push decided to boycott Nike because
Reebok has advertised in the group's magazine while Nike
hasn't.
   Nike has said the boycott hasn't had any effect on sales.
Operation Push said officials were unavailable for comment.
   Mr. Lee and Reebok said he was invited to consider joining
the Reebok board before Operation Push started its boycott in
August. He said he met Reebok Chairman Paul Fireman last
spring when the two helped organize Nelson Mandela's visit to
Boston.
   Some critics have complained that shoe companies encourage
poor inner-city youths to spend exorbitant funds buying
sneakers, such as Reebok's Pump shoes that retail for $150.
In some places police have reported people being mugged for
their sneakers. Mr. Lee said that Reebok sells shoes at a
variety of prices and that "Reebok has done no more and no
less than I would do as a businessman." He added, "I'm not
sure I've been able to see the ethical problem."
   Mr. Lee said that as a director "my primary responsibility
is a fiduciary duty to the shareholders." He said he believes
he was added to the board because of "my assumed business
acumen, my interest in sports and my enthusiasm for human
rights and companies that have an interest in human rights."
He said, "Reebok was thrown an added incentive because I
happen to be an African American."
   Mr. Lee, 51 years old, is chairman of BML Associates, a
Boston holding company with interests in radio stations and
the Nuggets. He is also chairman of Boston Bank of Commerce.
   In the past he has been president of New England
Television Corp., which owned the first minority-controlled
CBS network affiliate. Until last year he was a director of
Boston's Shawmut National Bank. He said he resigned that post
because he was spending much of his time in the Midwest. He
is also a director of numerous nonprofit institutions.
   He is chairman of TransAfrica Forum, an anti-apartheid
group, based in Washington, D.C., with which Reebok has
worked since sponsoring the Human Rights Now Tour for Amnesty
International, two years ago.

   Your Aug. 17 page-one story "Energy Options" concentrates
so much on short-term oil displacement that it ignores the
great contributions that have already been made by nuclear
energy in replacing foreign oil in the generation of
electricity. You fail to recognize that U.S. nuclear-energy
plants have reduced dependence on foreign oil since the 1973
oil embargo by 4.3 billion barrels and continue to cut our
use of foreign oil by 740,000 barrels every day. This is just
about the amount we had been importing from Iraq and Kuwait
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Construction of nuclear-energy plants to supply
electricity was a major part of this nation's efforts to use
domestic sources of energy to avoid its increasing dependence
on foreign oil after the 1973 embargo. We've forgotten that
lesson and, apparently, must relearn it.

   You dismiss renewable energy as "far-fetched alternatives"
that aren't economically viable. One need only look at
California's use of renewable energy resources last year to
see that these statements are completely untrue. In 1989,
18.2% of all electrical energy used in California came from
renewable energy resources. As one of those renewable
technologies, we believe that solar electric generating
systems (SEGS) are neither far-fetched nor uneconomical. As a
matter of fact, our newest 80-megawatt SEGS plant is
currently providing Southern California Edison electricity at
a cost of eight cents a kilowatt hour. This cost is cheaper
than nuclear and almost competitive with oil and gas.

   Alexander Cockburn's Aug. 16 column proves that no matter
how outrageous and one-sided his columns, he can top himself.
   First he takes the musings of "a former Jordanian
minister" about Israeli expansion into Jordan and establishes
that as a policy that might be followed by Israel -- without
a shred of evidence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Then he cites Amnesty International's reports on
atrocities in Iraq, but unless my memory fails me, in all his
articles seeking out Middle Eastern infractions of human
rights he has managed to continually cite Israel and until
now ignore violations in Arab countries.
   And then he totally ignores contemporary history by
comparing Israel's defensive wars of self-preservation to
Iraq's unprovoked attack on Kuwait. While one can argue about
Lebanon and might quibble about 1967 (when virtually all
observers considered Egypt's closing of vital waterways as
tantamount to an attack), only a fool could consider Israel's
response to an attack on its holiest day in 1973 wrong. Mr.
Cockburn is of course too opinionated to cite 1948, when all
surrounding nations attacked Israel or the fact that Jordan
attacked Israel in 1967, leading to Israel's capture of
former Jordanian territories, or that Saddam Hussein, in this
very paper less than two months ago, said that the Arab
world's biggest mistake was ignoring Israel's offer to
negotiate after the 1967 war and return captured territories.
   Israelis do not have "immense joy" because of the PLO
support of Iraq. They know that Saddam is a tyrant and that
if Israel had not acted to stop his nuclear capability in
1981, American soldiers would need far more than gas masks
today.

   Pension Funds Crowd Real Estate Pools' Exits
   ---
   Pulling Investments
   Isn't Easy, Though

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS (REA)

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- If you're having trouble selling a piece of
real estate, you're in good company.
   Big pension funds that poured billions of dollars into
real-estate investment pools now are finding it unexpectedly
hard to get their money out.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Starting in the late 1970s, many pension funds decided to
diversify their portfolios of stocks and bonds by investing
in commercial real estate, such as office buildings, shopping
malls and warehouses. Much of the estimated $120 billion they
shelled out went to insurance companies and banks that pooled
the money and bought scores of different properties.
   Now, with the real estate market wilting, most of the two
dozen so-called open-end real estate pools have been flooded
with demands from pension funds wanting their money back. The
withdrawal requests have fed on themselves and now are
approaching $2 billion. But paying off waiting investors
could take years, some pool operators say.
   Pool operators say that selling properties in today's
depressed market to meet withdrawal requests would force them
to accept fire-sale prices. "We're not going to sell a
property hastily to pay out one person to the detriment of
all the other investors," says a spokesman for Aetna Life &amp;
Casualty Co. As a result, pool operators are asking investors
to be patient; some, such as First Wachovia Corp., are
imposing withdrawal moratoriums of a year or more. And at
most pools, it is up to the operators to decide when to honor
withdrawal requests.
   The size of the waiting lists varies greatly. Investors
accounting for almost half of Cigna Corp.'s $769 million real
estate pool have asked for their money back. The insurer is
asking investors to accept a two-year delay in payouts. In
addition, it wants to make partial payouts, instead of doling
out sales proceeds on a first come, first served basis.
   At the biggest pool, Equitable Life Assurance Society of
the U.S.'s $3.7 billion Prime Property Fund, 25 clients have
asked to withdraw a total of $280 million. The fund began
making partial payments to investors last May, and Equitable
officials say they expect to catch up in nine months to a
year.
   That's a far cry from the promise of easy withdrawals that
attracted pension funds to the real estate pools during the
past 20 years. By the promise of letting investors move their
money in and out on short notice, pools were intended to
overcome investors' worries about real estate's lack of
liquidity -- the ability to sell a property quickly without
taking a financial bath.
   But as investors learned in the 1987 stock market crash,
liquidity can evaporate quickly when everyone rushes for the
exit at once. Several years of deteriorating real estate
prices and some pool operators' poor property selections have
soured many pension funds on real estate pools. And as pools
often pay withdrawals on a first come, first served basis,
other investors have rushed to join the exit line for fear of
being left behind.
   "When things are going well, no one wants to get out {of
pools}, and when things are going badly, everybody wants to
get out -- and no one can," says SEI Corp. real estate
consultant Nicholas Tannura. Richard Wollack, an Emeryville,
Calif., broker who specializes in helping pension funds that
want to get out of real estate pools, says, "There is no
liquidity in an open-end fund unless people think there is
liquidity."
   With the real estate market slumping, one pool run by John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. and others run by Bank of
Boston Corp. and Travelers Corp. have decided to sell all
their properties and return the proceeds to investors.
   But even liquidation won't guarantee that clients will get
their money back quickly. Bank of Boston, for example, has
sold only one property after a year of trying to unload its
$200 million pool portfolio. "We're going to be looking at an
extended time for disposition," says Thomas Lunny, director
of the Bank of Boston real-estate advisory arm.
   The exodus from real estate pools doesn't necessarily
signal that pension funds are souring on real estate as an
investment. Specialists believe pension funds with long-term
investment horizons will continue to use real estate to
diversify their stock and bond holdings and to help hedge
against inflation.
   "The reasons that pension funds went into real estate --
diversification, lower volatility for the total portfolio and
protection against inflation -- are still there," says Sylvia
Ferrell-Jones, who handles real estate investing for
Connecticut's public employee pension fund. "People should
not panic, based on the past two or three years of declining
performance."
   But as pension executives become more experienced with
real estate -- this was virtually unheard of in pension
portfolios only 20 years ago -- many of the larger funds are
starting to invest in closed-end pools, which don't promise
quick withdrawals, or buy properties directly. "We would
rather invest with a limited number of people or on our own
where we have more control," says Edward T. Tokar Jr., head
of Allied-Signal Inc.'s pension fund.
   But the withdrawal bug has spread to some closed-end real
estate funds. Unlike open-end funds, investors in closed-end
funds agree to tie up their money for years, but they usually
can withdraw if they find another investor to take their
place. In the past 18 months, "we've seen a doubling or
tripling" in the number of investors interested in such
swaps, though the number isn't overwhelming, says Mr.
Wollack, the California broker who helps arrange them.
   Worsening the withdrawal problem at many open-end pools is
the policy of making payouts on a first come, first served
basis. This puts pressure on pension funds to ask for their
money back as a protective measure, for fear that the
properties in the pool might be overvalued. In that case,
those pulling out first could get back more on their
investments than those who stay in the pool.
   "I am convinced that more than half those investors
standing in line {to withdraw} are doing so simply because
they saw the queue," says Paul Saylor of Atlanta-based
Institutional Property Consultants. Several pools have
switched to making partial payments, to ease withdrawal
pressure. But such moves irk investors that are near the
front of the withdrawal line and now will have to wait longer
for the full return of their money.
   Real estate veterans note that withdrawal lines have come
and gone before with market cycles, and that most pension
funds are slowing new investments but not abandoning the
market.
   Equitable, for one, says that its withdrawal requests now
are running at about the average for the past five years; its
withdrawal problem stems from a dearth of new investors
putting money into real estate, providing cash to pay off
those who want to leave, the insurer says.
   In addition, some real estate pools, including
Equitable's, actually have outpaced the stock and bond market
indexes during the past 12 months. "All of a sudden, this
year, when the stock and bond markets don't have dramatic
returns, our returns don't look so shabby," says Harry
Pierandri, portfolio manager for Equitable's Equitable Real
Estate Investment Management unit.

   General Motors Corp. said its engine division will provide
jobs to about 135 laid-off hourly workers at a new engine
remanufacturing business to be located in Lansing, Mich.
   The venture, while small, has symbolic importance as
contract talks between GM and the United Auto Workers union
head toward a strike deadline tomorrow night. The UAW is
demanding that GM step up efforts to re-employ idled workers
by launching ventures such as this.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The engine remanufacturing business is the first venture
to be funded by a $100 million fund established under the
1987 UAW-GM national contract. The fund is designed to
provide new jobs that aren't included in the scope of GM's
operations, the auto maker said. GM officials wouldn't
disclose the cost of the business.
   The remanufactured engines will be sold through the GM
service parts operations, a GM spokesman said.

   Expects Earnings
   To Top Forecasts

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
ALUMINUM (ALU)
CONTAINERS &amp; PACKAGING, BAGS, CANS, BOXES (CTR)
</IN>
<LP>
   RICHMOND, Va. -- Reynolds Metals Co. Chairman William O.
Bourke said he expects third-quarter earnings to exceed
analysts' expectations over 20% because of increasing revenue
from abroad.
   Mr. Bourke said the earnings will be near the second
quarter's $1.75 a share, exceeding analysts' projections of
about $1.45. Mr. Bourke, who is also chief executive officer,
said the nation's No. 2 aluminum concern should surpass $7 a
share in earnings for the year, against expectations of
$6.67.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even the higher-than-expected estimates, however, will
fall short of last year's levels of $2.10 for the third
quarter and $9.06 for the year. Mr. Bourke attributed the
year-to-year decline to ongoing slumps in the transportation
and construction industries and continued low market prices
for aluminum ingot.
   Mr. Bourke's bullish forecast apparently took Wall Street
by surprise, as Reynolds's stock rose $2.375 to close at
$68.375, a new 52-week high, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. On Tuesday, Mr. Bourke gave a sneak
preview of the more bullish earnings outlook to analysts at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's annual metals seminar.
   In an interview at Reynolds's headquarters here, Mr.
Bourke attributed the better-than-expected performance to
foreign business -- growing at a rate of 20% to 30% -- which
"more than offset" declining domestic demand. He also noted
that aluminum producers had virtually no surplus inventory,
contributing to a tight supply-demand situation that has
firmed prices.
   "There's just no surplus inventory anywhere, and we have
no intention of letting them increase," the executive said.
   Mr. Bourke also suggested that the earnings vindicated his
ongoing restructuring of Reynolds's operations, in which he
wrote off 45% of the company's assets and diversified into
gold, plastics, and fabricated aluminum products. Mr. Bourke
has tried to focus on such products in an effort to protect
the company from aluminum's wide price swings.
   Aluminum analyst Stewart Spector said Reynolds's strong
performance was driven by higher-than-expected ingot prices.
While off from last year's highs, the rise in raw aluminum
prices -- 46% since January -- has exceeded Wall Street's
expectations.
   Reynolds's sluggish domestic growth, stemming largely from
its reliance on depressed construction and transportation
markets, won't improve before the middle of next year, Mr.
Bourke said. The executive said the company's capital
expenditure program of over $3 billion, begun in 1988, should
add $150 million to profit in 1991 and as much as $200
million in 1992.
   Separately, Reynolds Metals said its Mount Vernon Plastics
Corp. unit opened a $15 million plant in Sparks, Nev., that
makes plastic overcaps for canned coffee, margarine tubs and

products, and microwave trays. By year end, the plant will
have about 150 employees, the company said.

   We very much appreciate the review ("The Sick Soviet
Bear," Leisure &amp; Arts, Aug. 28) by Charles Wolf Jr. of our
book, "Meltdown: Inside the Soviet Economy," but we would
like to correct one point of great importance. Mr. Wolf
reports that we "repeatedly urge reliance on and support for
Mikhail Gorbachev." To the contrary, in our book we note that
the dynamics of economic reform are no longer in his hands,
and we have publicly criticized the Bush administration for
putting all its eggs in Mr. Gorbachev's basket. Mr. Gorbachev
may have missed the opportunity to use privatization to
strengthen the Soviet Union against political disintegration.
The movement toward autonomous republics might require the
assignment of property rights, in whole or part, on a
republic basis.

   BROOKLYN, N.Y. -- A federal judge and a New York state
judge called off plans for an unusual, joint federal-state
trial against former asbestos makers because settlement talks
have successfully resolved most of the cases.
   Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn and state
Justice Helen Freedman of Manhattan had scheduled the trial
to begin Tuesday if efforts to settle the approximately 500
cases failed. In an order, the judges said that almost all of
the cases have been settled or are in the process of being
settled and that a joint trial won't be necessary.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The personal-injury cases involve former Brooklyn Navy
Yard workers who were exposed to asbestos on the job.
Asbestos, once widely used in insulation, causes cancer and
respiratory ailments years after exposure. More than 40
former asbestos makers and distributors were named as
defendants.
   The two judges teamed up earlier this year to consolidate
the cases and push for a settlement in a federal-state
effort. The hearings rotated from state to federal court,
with both judges presiding at most of the proceedings.
   In their order, the judges praised Kenneth Feinberg, the
court-appointed special master who oversaw the settlement
efforts.
   The settlement amounts haven't been disclosed. The cases
that aren't settled are scheduled to go to trial in separate
state and federal proceedings beginning next week.

   It seems that any piece of legislation -- such as the
Textile Quota Bill passed by the Senate with which you
disagree ("The Jesse and Pat Bill," Review &amp; Outlook, July
31) -- is mere crass politics, while those you agree with are
matters of high principle or sound economic reasoning.
   Maybe the Senate was trying to tell the Bush
administration that what is being negotiated in the Uruguay
trade talks may be a disaster for American industry and lead
to a further widening of our unacceptable trade deficit.
Enormous attention has been focused on our domestic deficit,
but the continuing attrition of our national wealth through
the steady $100 billion-plus per-year trade deficit is all
but ignored. The administration has said quite directly that
reduction of the trade deficit is not one of its objectives
in these negotiations. And I believe studies will bear out
the fact that the trade deficit contributes more importantly
to the budget deficit than vice versa.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   You cite how a textile bill that guarantees developing
nations only two-thirds of our apparel market, instead of a
more "competitive" 90% or 95%, is quite unfair to these poor
folks. But you fail to mention that if the full U.S. position
on intellectual property were to be adopted in the Geneva
negotiations, more than $50 billion would be drained from
these very same countries and transferred to U.S.
corporations. This amount is far more than developing
countries would gain through increased exports of textile and
apparel products.
   What is even more striking is your use of a partial, and
inaccurate, economic study to justify the virtues of the
free-market system. While the Federal Trade Commission
exaggerated the cost to consumers of textile quotas and
tariffs, a more complete economic analysis should evaluate
the cost or gain to our total economy, not just to one
segment. Such a comprehensive study was done on the textile
bill the last time Congress considered it, by ICF, an
independent economic consulting firm. That study concluded
that for the U.S. economy as a whole, textile quotas resulted
in a net gain of $1.5 billion.
   In the domestic market, we have not accepted unfettered
free trade for half a century. Such a 19th- and 20th-century
system resulted in mass poverty and robber barons. We prevent
abuse of market power through anti-trust and anti-monopoly
laws. We prevent misdistribution of capital through numerous
securities laws. We create consumer demand by enabling
workers to form unions, receive mandated minimum levels of
compensation and prevent their exploitation by inhuman
working conditions. We preserve other social goods, equal in
validity to economic efficiency, by imposing environmental,
health and safety standards on industrial enterprises. But
none of these restraints are being required in the
international free market; none are being demanded in the
Uruguay Round nor are part of any existing GATT agreements.
   We fail to see why the American public should support
international negotiations where there is a real potential
that our country will come out the loser. Just because
economic theory says things will work out for the best, the
best or reality could very well end up to our national
detriment. It seems the Senate understands this by their more
than two-thirds approval of the textile bill.

   Darling-Delaware, Despite Past Payouts
   To Owners, Will Omit Junk-Bond Interest
   ----

   Darling-Delaware Co. lacks cash to pay interest on its
high-yield junk bonds, just 20 months after it paid a $179
million dividend to the prominent Texas and Connecticut
investors who own the company.
   Darling-Delaware, based in Dallas, is the largest U.S.
rendering company, producing tallow and bone meal from animal
parts. For the first six months of 1990, the company reported
an $11.3 million loss on revenue of $177.8 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Darling-Delaware has stopped filing quarterly results with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, asserting that it is
a private company that doesn't need to make public filings.
It still sends reports to bondholders, though, and in a
footnote to its second-quarter report, the company said it
"doesn't have sufficient cash" to make a $12.2 million
interest payment that is due Saturday on its 14% senior
subordinated notes. The company added that it "doesn't
anticipate that it will be able to borrow funds" to make the
payment.
   Until this year, Darling-Delaware had been highly
profitable for its owners. These include Fort Worth, Texas,
investor Richard Rainwater; Edward W. Rose III, a co-owner of
the Texas Rangers baseball team; and Airlie Group, a
Greenwich, Conn., investment firm. Airlie's main owners and
investors are former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employee
Dort Cameron, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.
and the Bass family of Texas.
   On Jan. 3, 1989, Darling-Delaware paid $179 million to its
owners, including $25.8 million to Mr. Rose, $62.4 million to
Airlie Group, then known as Investment L.P., and $9.5 million
for Mr. Rainwater. The amounts were disclosed in an SEC
filing for Darling-Delaware's junk bonds, which were issued
two months later.
   Analysts and bondholders voiced dismay at the downturn in
Darling-Delaware's fortunes so soon after the company's big
payout to the owners. "It's clear they took too much of a
dividend," said Hannah Strasser, an analyst at Deltec
Securities, which owns some Darling-Delaware bonds.
   Executives at Airlie didn't return repeated phone calls
seeking comment. Mr. Rainwater declined to comment, as did a
spokesman for Mr. Rose.
   Darling-Delaware's junk bonds have sunk steadily since
being issued, traders said, and were quoted yesterday at just
22 cents on the dollar. The bonds, which were underwritten by
the failed Drexel, were downgraded to a double-C rating last
week by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Bondholders said Darling-Delaware and its financial
advisers, Jefferies &amp; Co., have called a meeting for today in
New York at which they are expected to put forth a
debt-restructuring plan. Deltec's Ms. Strasser said she
expects bondholders will push for Darling-Delaware's owners
to put more cash into the company and give some equity to
bondholders in return for bondholders' willingness to
exchange their bonds for less costly debt.
   In March, Darling-Delaware's owners pumped $24 million
into the company, helping the company meet its interest
payment then.
   In its second-quarter report, Darling-Delaware, which
employs about 2,000 people, disclosed a variety of business
setbacks. It said a slowdown in cattle slaughterings reduced
its intake of raw material, while environmental regulators
told the company it may be liable for the clean-up of waste
dumps in Houston and Shelbyville, Ind., and a switch in U.S.
eating habits away from beef and toward pork and chicken has
left the company with less profitable raw materials.
   Despite these difficulties, "Darling's sophisticated
investor group must support this credit," said Jeremy
Bloomer, managing director of Credit Research &amp; Trading
Corp., Greenwich, Conn. Otherwise, Mr. Bloomer said, the
company's owners "might be forced to return part of their
{$179 million} dividend" under various possible legal claims
by bondholders.
   Ms. Strasser said bondholders have hired a Chicago law
firm, Chapman &amp; Cutler, to advise them on their options but
haven't made any decision yet on litigation.

   Company-Owned Arby's
   To Accept Credit Cards
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   THE TRICKLE of credit cards into fast-food outlets is
about to grow: Arby's Inc., the No. 7 sandwich chain, plans
to start accepting credit cards soon at all 245 company-owned
restaurants.
   Though a number of fast-food chains, including Kentucky
Fried Chicken and Burger King, have experimented with credit
cards, Arby's will be the first to go national. Over time,
Arby's expects many of its 2,055 franchised units to accept
them as well.
   Like other fast-food chains, Arby's was reluctant to slow
service for credit-card approvals. But it wanted to take
advantage of the cards' potential: In test markets, people
tended to spend 40% to 60% more at Arby's when they didn't
have to shell out cash.
   "Places like Denny's and Shoney's already take them, and
with some good marketing and incentives, they can spread in
fast food, too," says Kurt Peters, editor of Credit Card
News. MasterCard International, which is participating in the
Arby's program, says credit-card sales in fast-food
restaurants could top $1 billion annually in the next six
years.
   With a computer system using a "bad guys" list, Arby's has
cut credit-card approval time to less than a second from the
20 to 45 seconds required for standard bank authorizations.
Card numbers will be checked against a file listing stolen,
canceled and over-the-limit credit cards. The list is sent
daily via satellite by the maker of the system, MerchanTec
International, Tucker, Ga.
   Relying on the negative file has risks. Stolen cards don't
show up right away, so bad cards can slip by. But fast-food
places face small losses since their average sale is far
lower than that of most stores.

   EVEN AS you read this, you or someone you know may be
trapped in a Kids in Control home.
   So named by NPD Group Inc., a Port Washington, N.Y.,
market-research firm, these homes represent about 19% of all
U.S. households. And in them, people wolf down more
kid-oriented food.
   Most of these homes have kids. But fully 43% don't; in
these homes, the adults just eat like children. They zap more
food in the microwave, and taste is one of their main
motivators in deciding what to eat.
   These people snap up peanut butter, jelly, snack cakes,
ketchup, pizza, fish sticks, cold cereal, macaroni and
cheese, cold cuts, ready-to-eat popcorn, Velveeta and dips.
They shun fresh fish, decaffeinated coffee, oatmeal, skim
milk, sugar substitutes and meatloaf.
   In Kids in Control homes, the adults -- with or without
children -- care little about health and a lot about price.
They are less cautious than others about salt, cholesterol,
preservatives, fat and sugar, and they favor generic and
store-label brands over national or regional ones.
   Represented mostly by two-parent families, Kids in Control
homes are somewhat more blue-collar and tend to be located in
the Northeast and Midwest.

   And Pepsi in Cola Wars
                                                                                                       

   REMEMBER Coca-Cola's MagiCans? They may be back in 1992.
   Coke marketing and technical officials met several weeks
ago, say people familiar with the meeting, to discuss what
went wrong with this summer's promotion and how it could be
resurrected.
   Under a crush of bad publicity about the prize-filled
cans, some of which didn't open properly, Coca-Cola cut the
promotion short in June. But Coke insiders are still enamored
of the idea, which boosted sales substantially. Even while
discussing a 1992 relaunch date, however, Coke wants to
ensure that all technical flaws are erased. And so far, no
managers are pushing hard for the project. Coke says no
decision has been made on a relaunch.
   PepsiCo's Cool Cans, meanwhile, may return in the form of
Yule Cans.
   Over the summer, Pepsi-Cola lined store shelves with
brightly illustrated Cool cans. On one can, a surfer rode a
wave; another can displayed a woman wearing sunglasses with
Pepsi logo lenses. After the success of that promotion, the
company confirms it is now considering Yule Cans, which might
use yuletide graphics.
                                                                                                       

   Using 3-D Pitches
   To Attract Business
                                                                                                       

   IN TRYING to lure new businesses, Richmond, Va., doesn't
just fire off chamber of commerce letters and glossy photos
of downtown landmarks.
   It sends toasters, gavels, baseballs, harmonicas,
compasses, Civil War bullets, thermometers, seashells and
calculators shaped like matchbooks.
   The calculators? They bear the message, "Add up the
reasons {Richmond} is the perfect match for your business."
Toasters? "Another major headquarters just popped up in
Richmond."
   The approach might sound hokey, but it gets results. In
the past three years, about 50 businesses have built or moved
headquarters, manufacturing or distribution plants or
divisions to Richmond. Omni Products International Inc.
recently opened a patio-furniture factory in Richmond. The
marketing ploys "helped emphasize the good points about the
city," says Richard Barker, Omni's president.
   Richmond started this all with an item or two about 10
years ago, and in recent years it has expanded its offerings.
"Executives are bombarded with all kinds of mail, half of
which is screened out by their secretaries," says A.J.
Christopher Wood, executive director of the Richmond area's
development council. "We decided to try three-dimensional
mailings to get into their offices."

   NEW YORK -- The New York Mercantile Exchange said it
started an investigation of false rumor-spreading that may
have resulted in the sharp run-up of crude oil futures prices
Monday.
   In heavy trading in the final 20 minutes of the Nymex
energy futures session, prices of crude oil futures and
petroleum product futures for October surged over $1.60 a
barrel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An exchange spokeswoman said it had no suspects at this
time, but the offender could be fined as much as $250,000 and
suspended from trading. She added that the exchange would
notify the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
Justice Department.
   The spokeswoman added that based on previous Nymex
investigations there wasn't much confidence anyone would be
charged.
   Traders and analysts that were aware of the investigation
doubt that the Nymex would be able to locate and discipline a
culprit.
   One trader noted after learning of the investigation that
troop movements inside of Iraq and near Turkish and Syrian
borders were confirmed by the U.S. State Department early
Tuesday. Those movements, and early, limited knowledge of
such activity, he said, could have been the base for the talk
in oil markets Monday.

   Battle Over Funds

   WASHINGTON -- Senate appropriations subcommittees plunged
into a set of disruptive fights over how to meet new funding
commitments on issues ranging from the United Nations to AIDS
treatment and law enforcement.
   Practically all new funding for a landmark AIDS relief
bill would be deferred for 12 months under allocations
approved yesterday as part of an almost $176.4 billion health
and education measure for fiscal 1991. And while fulfilling
President Bush's commitment to increase U.S. donations to the
U.N., two of the principal authors of the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law first had to bust
their own budget for an estimated $19.7 billion bill covering
the State, Justice and Commerce Departments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The AIDS and U.N. issues are sure to be revisited by the
full Appropriations Committee, and the maneuvering is a
harbinger of the conflict ahead as lawmakers come to terms
with the even tighter spending limits being set by the
current budget negotiations between Congress and the White
House.
   Advocates of increased funding for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome said offsetting cuts could be found
within the existing limits, but as the budget talks ratchet
down the numbers further, these choices will be more
difficult in the weeks before November's election.
   As approved yesterday by the subcommittee, an estimated
$2.17 billion is budgeted for AIDS-related research and
treatment, but any expenditure of the $490 million allocated
for state and city grants under the bill would be deferred
until Oct. 1, 1992. The impact falls most directly on such
cities as New York, San Francisco and Miami, which were
targeted for funds, and the decision met bitter criticism
from advocates of increased AIDS treatment and counseling.
   "The provision is hollow without real dollars," said Tom
Sheridan of the AIDS Action Council, adding: "No money means
lost lives."
   Tom Harkin (D., Iowa), chairman of the health and
education subcommittee, has won praise from the same
organizations in the past for his support of AIDS funding.
But up for re-election, he appears bent on using available
funds for education and health services with more immediate
impact on his constituents. Rural health and Alzheimer's
research funding would double to almost $593 million, and
both Head Start and compensatory education programs for
disadvantaged elementary school students would be increased
substantially from current funding.
   From the outset this year, Mr. Bush has emphasized the
need for the U.S. to better meet its obligations to the U.N.,
and this pressure has only increased with the Mideast crisis.
In line with this request, the bill approved yesterday by the
state, justice and commerce subcommittee provides an
estimated $908.6 million for international organizations and
peace-keeping operations; the entire measure is approximately
$600 million over budget.
   The action could invite other subcommittees to follow
suit, and is all the more ironic because the major sponsors
-- Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) and Sen. Warren Rudman
(R., N.H.) -- played such a role in designing the present
budget process.
   Though the largest single element, the U.N. funding is
only part of the overrun, and members increased money
elsewhere for law-enforcement accounts including expanded
investigations into savings-and-loan fraud.
   In a related decision, the subcommittee voted to extend a
$5 inspection fee to air and sea passengers entering the U.S.
from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, which are currently
exempted from the charge. First adopted in 1986, the fee
serves to defray the costs of Immigration and Naturalization
Service inspectors. By ending the current exemption, the INS
hopes to raise $83 million annually to cover the cost of
1,000 new staffers.

   Bertelsmann AG expects its profit to edge about 3.9%
higher in the fiscal year ending next June 30 to 530 million
marks ($333 million) on a 3% sales gain to around 13.7
billion marks.
   Executives at the West German media giant also said
Bertelsmann is moving ahead in establishing a bridgehead in
Eastern Europe for its book clubs, newspapers, magazines,
entertainment and electronic media activities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The closely held company reported that its profit in the
fiscal year ending June 30 rose 26.9% from a year earlier to
510 million marks from 402 million marks. Sales were up 6.4%
to 13.3 billion marks from 12.5 billion marks.
   In the U.S., where the company derives about one-third of
its global sales, Bertelsmann has made a "turnaround" at
previously struggling operations, like the New York-based
Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Chairman Mark
Woessner said.
   Mr. Woessner said that the company is still looking for a
partner to launch another U.S. record label. The company
intends to build up its global market share in music, by
means of linking up with other companies in international
entertainment ventures.

   Fed Rules on Banks'
   Right to End Payments

   WASHINGTON -- Banks can stop borrowers' ability to tap
into home-equity lines of credit, the Federal Reserve said,
if the fluctuating interest rate paid by the borrower hits
the cap specified in the loan agreement.
   The amended regulation stems from a 1989 lawsuit filed by
Consumers Union, which challenged the Fed regulation as a
violation of the Home Equity Act.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The law prohibited lenders from changing the terms of a
home-equity loan after the account had been opened. But the
Fed added an exemption, which allows the banks to stop
disbursing funds if an interest-rate cap is reached and those
terms are spelled out in the lending agreement.
   "Under this regulation, the consumer can't borrow money he
expected to under his line of credit," said Michelle Meier,
counsel for government affairs for Consumers Union. "He will
have to go another lender at a higher interest rate."
   The U.S. District Court here dismissed the suit in May,
saying that the Fed has broad authority to rule on such
matters. Consumers Union said it will appeal. As of 1988,
about $75 billion in home-equity loans were outstanding, Ms.
Meier said.

   NEW YORK -- Investors poured $2.4 billion into money
market mutual funds in the latest week.
   Assets of the 435 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report increased $1.1 billion, to $399.9 billion,
the Holliston, Mass., newsletter said. The average seven-day
compounded yield, which assumes reinvestment of dividends,
remained at 7.75% in the week ended Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Money fund portfolio managers lengthened the average
maturity of taxable funds' investments by a day, to 47 days,
indicating that the managers expect short-term interest rates
to decline. "They want to lock in the higher yields," said
Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's. The funds invest in
such things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.
Average maturity is now the longest it's been since August
1987.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
remained at 7.47%. The average 30-day simple yield slipped to
7.48% from 7.49%, and the average 30-day compounded yield
eased to 7.76% from 7.77%.
   Assets of 231 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's rose
$1.3 billion to $81.2 billion, a record, the newsletter said.
The average seven-day compounded yield rose to 5.54% from
5.43%. The latest yield is equal to 7.69% for an investor in
the 28% tax bracket and 8.27% for someone paying 33% in
taxes.
   The average maturity of the tax-exempt funds remained at
59 days.

   Bid of $40 a Share Challenges
   Stock-Swap Agreement
   With Willis Faber PLC

   Aon Corp. made a surprise $40-a-share, or $840 million,
proposal for Corroon &amp; Black Corp., challenging a
$33.49-a-share, or $703 million, stock-swap accord under
which the New York insurance broker has agreed to merge with
Willis Faber PLC of London.
   Aon's unsolicited all-cash proposal offers a premium to
the terms of the tentative deal with Willis Faber, which
received a chilly reaction from the market when it was
announced in June, and on which Corroon holders haven't yet
voted. But some experts said tax and other considerations
make Aon's proposal less than a sure bet to succeed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Corroon &amp; Black said it is "studying" the new bid from the
Chicago insurance concern. In composite New York Stock
Exchange trading yesterday, Corroon shares soared $6.75, to
close at $37.625. Volume was nearly 1.7 million shares.
   The latest proposal represents one of the first big public
bidding contests in a year marked by a dearth of high-profile
takeover battles. This year's merger slowdown reflects the
collapse of the junk-bond market, tight bank credit
conditions and most recently the economic uncertainty created
by the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   The combination of Aon's Rollins Burdick Hunter Group
insurance brokerage unit with Corroon &amp; Black would create
the world's fourth-largest insurance brokerage concern, with
annual revenue of nearly $1 billion, Aon said.
   An insurance broker specializes in assisting primarily
corporate clients in seeking and arranging coverage with an
insurance company.
   "We are not interested in pursuing any transaction which
is opposed by your board of directors," Patrick G. Ryan, Aon
chairman, president and chief executive officer, wrote in a
letter to Corroon &amp; Black's chairman and chief executive,
Richard M. Miller. But, he continued, "we believe that your
board will conclude, as our board and financial advisers . .
. have concluded, that $40 in cash per share from Aon Corp.
represents a superior proposal to the proposed merger" with
Willis Faber.
   Under the proposed merger with the London insurance
broker, Corroon holders would receive for each of their
shares 7.8 shares of Willis, whose shares currently trade on
London's stock exchange. While the swap offered stock worth
$38.13 the morning the accord was offered, Willis shares have
slumped since the disclosure, and Corroon shares have
similarly declined. In London trading Wednesday, Willis
shares closed off one pence at 231 pence, or $4.29, a share.
Willis officials weren't available for comment.
   Mr. Ryan stressed in the letter to his counterpart that
Aon's proposal "is firm and not subject to fluctuation" and
"eliminates all of the concerns which your stock holders may
have about currency exchange rates, stock market
fluctuations, the trading and liquidity of American
depositary receipts, and the tax treatment of foreign source
dividends."
   The Aon offer for Corroon &amp; Black is "a complete
surprise," especially because Corroon was just weeks away
from completing its merger with Willis Faber, said Russell
Miller, a San Francisco investment banker. He added that Aon
hadn't given any indication that it wanted to expand its
insurance brokerage business to the size that it would if it
swallowed Corroon &amp; Black. Currently, Corroon is the fifth
largest insurance broker in the U.S. and Rollins Burdick
ranks seventh.
   While the Willis Faber offer for Corroon got a cool
reception in the U.S. market, analysts had viewed the merger
as a good strategic move for both companies. Corroon had been
looking to expand internationally to better serve its large
corporate clients. The merger would give Willis Faber a
significant presence in the vast U.S. insurance market.
   "Aon may have the money, but it doesn't have the European
or Asian connections that Willis Faber has," Mr. Miller, the
investment banker, said.
   Aon shares slipped $1.50 in Big Board trading yesterday,
closing at $33.
   Its cash bid for Corroon represents a higher
price-to-earnings ratio than other recent acquisitions in the
insurance brokerage industry. But Mr. Miller figures that on
an after-tax basis, the Aon offer doesn't give Corroon
shareholders a much greater profit than if they stuck with
the Willis Faber proposal. Cash deals require selling
shareholders to pay capital-gains taxes, while stock-swap
transactions are typically done on a tax-free basis.
   Such a tax consideration could be an important one, as
about 30% of Corroon's stock is held by management and
company employees. These employees include many former
brokerage agency owners who sold their firms to Corroon in
exchange for stock.
   To make the deal more appealing, Mr. Miller expects Aon
would probably have to offer more cash. Yet, he believes
Willis Faber may sweeten its offer for Corroon.
   Not all analysts are betting on a higher bid for Corroon,
however. Ira Malis, an insurance industry analyst at Alex.
Brown &amp; Sons, advised clients that with Corroon shares
selling near $38, "I'd be more of a seller than a buyer. I
don't have a lot of confidence in a higher deal coming
along."
   Corroon's shares retreated from a high yesterday of
$38.125, as traders became concerned that Willis Faber might
not try to top the Aon bid and that Corroon and the London
concern might try to go through with their merger on the
original terms. While Corroon and Faber holders must still
approve the merger in votes scheduled for Sept. 28, some
traders worried that Aon could drop its bid if Corroon
directors rebuffed it.
   Some analysts noted that the economic environment for a
merger between two U.S. brokers is hardly upbeat right now.
Property/casualty insurers have been locked in a three-year
pricing war and brokers have watched their profit margins
slip as their commissions and fees, which are based on
premiums, declined.
   Aon's largest unit is its Combined Insurance Co., the
company founded by Aon's former head, W. Clement Stone. Mr.
Stone stepped down as the holding company's chairman earlier
this year at age 87, and Mr. Ryan added that title.

   NEW YORK -- The stock market, led by energy and metals
stocks, moved higher in continued light trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.12 to 2625.74 as
gains in three blue-chip oil issues -- Exxon, Chevron and
Texaco -- and in Aluminum Co. of America boosted the 30-stock
measure by a total of about 10.40 points.

   Traders attributed a late surge to speculation that Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein might be overthrown, spurred by a
report from Egypt's state-run news agency that his control of
the country is being undermined by a growing dissident
movement and a coup was likely.
   The rally took the market back up to the vicinity of
session highs reached just after trading opened. President
Bush's address to Congress, in which he declared that the
Iraqi leader "will fail" in his efforts to annex Kuwait,
served as an inspiration for the early gains, traders said.
   In between, concerns about a statement from Iran
expressing opposition to the U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf and periodic bouts of futures-related program
selling kept stocks under pressure, traders said.
   "The market's still in the same quandary," said Richard
Meyer, head of institutional trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp;
Co. "Without news, the market has no direction in which to
go."
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 129,890,000 shares were
traded, compared with 113,220,000 shares Tuesday. Advancers
led decliners by 778 to 638.
   Among broader market indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index climbed 1.50 to 322.54, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index went up 0.70 to 177.09 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index rose 1.07 to 298.80.
   Several analysts said the heavy selling which had preceded
the market's recent lull -- and the increasing pessimism
developing among investors -- indicate that the market is
about due to break out of its recent trading range with a
rally.
   Since Aug. 23, the Dow Jones industrials has stayed within
a range of about 40 points on a closing basis -- between its
Aug. 29 reading of 2632.43 and its Aug. 30 close of 2593.32.
   "We've had plenty of excuses for {stocks} to go down
again," said Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer
&amp; Co., and the show of stability provides evidence that
investors "who just have to get out {of the market} and have
to raise cash have already done it."
   Meanwhile, the latest survey of investment advisors by
Investors Intelligence -- a popular indicator of market
sentiment -- showed a sharp increase in the level of market
bearishness.
   Of the market letter writers surveyed a week ago, 56% held
a pessimistic outlook on stocks while only 30% were bullish
and 14% were expecting a short-term correction. The readings
were in line with levels reached at the market's lows in late
January, when more than 57% of the advisers were bearish and
less than 30% were bullish.
   The data "would indicate that a lot of people have already
moved to the sidelines," said Michael Burke, editor of the
survey for Chartcraft Inc., New Rochelle, N.Y. That should
insulate the market from any sharp drops over the short run,
he added.
   Exxon went up 1/2 to 51 3/8 in composite trading of 1.3
million shares, while Chevron advanced 1 to 77 1/8 and Texaco
climbed 1 3/4 to 64 3/8. Among other oil stocks, Mobil gained
3/4 to 66, Amoco added 7/8 to 58, Unocal added 5/8 to 32 7/8
and Atlantic Richfield went up 2 3/8 to 138 5/8. In the
oilfield-services sector, Schlumberger rose 1 1/4 to 66 7/8
and Halliburton rose 3/4 to 54 7/8.
   Alcoa advanced 2 to 68 1/4, while Alcan Aluminium gained
1/2 to 22 1/8 and topped the exchange's list of most active
issues with 3.5 million shares. Reynolds Metals, which said
it expects third-quarter earnings to be close to the second
quarter's $1.75 a share, jumped 2 3/8 to 68 3/8; its forecast
was higher than many analysts had projected.
   Elsewhere in the metals sector, Amax rose 1 1/2 to 26 and
Phelps Dodge climbed 1 7/8 to 63 3/4 on the Big Board.
Maxxam, which owns Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical, jumped 3 3/8
to 62 on the American Stock Exchange.
   Corroon &amp; Black rallied 6 3/4 to 37 5/8 on three million
shares. Aon expressed interest in buying the insurance
company for $40 a share, or about $840 million. Corroon &amp;
Black has agreed to a stock-swap merger offer from Willis
Faber, a British insurer. Aon dropped 1 1/2 to 33.
   Browning-Ferris Industries dipped 1 1/2 to 33 on 1.9
million shares after several analysts, in response to a more
cautious outlook from the company, lowered their earnings
estimate for the fiscal year ending this month and the
following year.
   Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Vishnu Swarup, who
lowered his fiscal 1991 forecast for Browning-Ferris by five
cents a share to $2.30, also downgraded the stock's rating to
"hold" from "buy." Mr. Swarup told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report his actions reflected economic weakness in
the Northeast, which produces 12% to 13% of the company's
revenue. He maintained his fiscal 1990 estimate at $2 a
share.
   Waste Management, another pollution-control issue, also
was a victim of heavy selling. The stock dipped 3/4 to 35 1/2
in composite trading of about 1.3 million shares. But
ServiceMaster, which agreed to combine certain operations
with two Waste Management units in a partnership, rose 3/4 to
22.
   Santa Fe Pacific fell 1/2 to 14 7/8 on 1.9 million shares.
The company said it would swap 14.5 million common shares for
$215.6 million in debentures under an exchange offer which
expires Tuesday.
   Gulf States Utilities skidded 1 3/8 to 10 1/8. The Texas
Supreme Court, overturning an earlier appeals-court ruling,
decided that state utility regulators didn't have the
authority to reconsider $1.4 billion in costs related to the
company's River Bend nuclear plant in setting rates.
   MNC Financial rose 3/8 to 7 1/8 on 1.3 million shares. Its
board approved plans to sell $180 million in preferred stock
to Alfred Lerner, a director, and maintained the company's
common-stock dividend at 29 cents a share. MNC shares dropped
in heavy trading last week amid rumors that the sale was in
jeopardy and the dividend would be reduced.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.18
to 323.19. Volume totaled 9,260,000 shares.

   Wave of Kidnappings in Brazil
   Grabs Attention of Jaded Locals

   RIO DE JANEIRO -- A few weeks ago, a top American
executive from a major multinational corporation was all set
to come here on business and to visit a relative at the same
time. But he ran into a problem: His employer wouldn't let
him make the trip.
   "We wouldn't send anyone down there unless absolutely
necessary," explains a spokesman for the company, who asked
that the identities of the company and the executive not be
disclosed for "obvious security reasons." Going to Rio these
days, he adds, "would be the same as going to the {Persian}
Gulf."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although few companies hold such extreme views or take
such extreme precautions, Rio is, in fact, a dangerous city.
Kidnapping has replaced the lambada as the latest Brazilian
craze. The targets are usually prosperous businessmen, and
have included one foreigner, a West German executive who
police found five days after his abduction.
   In Rio, alone, there have been 31 kidnappings this year --
more than double the figure for all of Brazil last year --
and total ransom payments exceeding $10 million. This week,
breaking a 69-day lull, kidnappers struck again, nabbing two
students, Vania Benzaquem and Alexandre Wenkert, as they
drove to college. Both are children of wealthy businessmen,
and one of the executives commented that kidnapping "is one
of the few growth industries in Brazil."
   But the kidnapping wave is no joke. Long used to living
with high levels of violence, Brazilian society has suddenly
grown afraid that the kidnappings are a disturbing sign that
organized crime is taking hold of urban areas. "Criminal
groups are organizing more and more and getting increasingly
involved in politics," says Alba Zaluar, a sociologist
specializing in crime. "{The kidnappers} may be trying to
interfere in the {October gubernatorial and congressional}
elections, get money to buy votes to support politicians {who
are} less inclined to repress."
   Police and state government officials disagree. Jorge
Mario Gomes, the director of the police's anti-kidnapping
division, sees a simple reason for the sudden surge in
kidnappings: the need for money. Many of the kidnappers, he
says, are people who used to rob banks. But since Brazil
enforced a tough anti-inflation plan in March, freezing much
of the money in circulation, banks have less cash. Moreover,
many of the kidnappers had their illicit cash gains frozen,
too.
   So kidnapping has become "the fashionable crime," Mr.
Gomes asserts.
   The ruckus triggered by the surge of kidnappings is
starting to focus attention on Brazil's crime problem.
   So pervasive is Rio's crime that some joke that the city's
symbol, the huge statue of Christ that dominates the city
from a hilltop, should have its hands up instead of
outstretched. In 1989, according to police figures, there
were 7,654 homicides, 1,201 rapes, 14,436 car robberies,
65,027 robberies, 3,104 break-ins and 420 bank robberies in
the state of Rio. The population tops three million.
   Now, a new fighting spirit is emerging."Kidnappings are
the drop of water that made the glass spill over," says Nello
Pedra Gandara, the owner of the Four Paws Kennel in Sao
Paolo, a dog-training establishment that's doing a huge
business offering $1,200-a-month anti-kidnapping courses with
the use of dogs. Many other security outfits are cashing in
on fear, offering to install James Bond-like gadgets on cars
or to teach drivers defensive measures.
   While many say this uproar illustrates the injustice of
Brazilian society -- violence only becomes an issue when it
moves out of the slums and affects members of the elite --
security is emerging as a leading theme in the October
elections. Some 57% of respondents to a recent survey in the
daily Folha de Sao Paulo identified crime as the leading
problem in Rio today, far ahead of cost of living, the usual
bogeyman, which drew only 17%.
   Sitting under a three-dimensional picture of Jesus Christ
whose eyes open and close depending on the angle from which
it's looked at, an exhausted-looking Mr. Gomes, the
anti-kidnap chief, says: "I sleep only three hours a night.
My family sees me only on television."
   Mr. Gomes has results to show for his long hours of work,
however. "We're arresting people daily," he says. More than
70 people have been arrested in the past few weeks and the
police claim to have identified and begun to dismantle nine
different but interlinked kidnapping groups.
   Some cases have been bizarre.
   In one case in Sao Paulo in July, the family of
businessman Gilberto Bernardini paid a much higher ransom
than the kidnappers had requested. When they called for the
first time, they requested five million cruzeiros, or about
$60,000. Mr. Bernardini's son, also named Gilberto,
misunderstood. He thought they asked for $5 million and
started negotiating on that basis. He ended up shelling out
$1.8 million.
   In Rio, businessman Sergio de Paulo Pacheco was kidnapped
and released the following day after payment of a ransom of
$200,000 plus 10 million cruzeiros, another $125,000. Mr.
Pacheco never reported the case to the police. A few weeks
later, however, he complained that those who had kidnapped
him were now threatening to kidnap him again unless he paid
yet another 25 million cruzeiros. The police laid a trap and
arrested four kidnappers. Among them was a soldier in the
Military Police.
   Roberto Medina, a prominent advertising executive and rock
promoter, has helped arouse Brazilian outrage over the
kidnappings. His case brought home to many the growing
audacity of kidnappers.
   Mr. Medina was kidnapped in early June as he left the
offices of Artplan, his advertising company. He was taken to
a cold, humid house where he spent two weeks sleeping on the
floor, his eyes covered with glasses whose lenses were
blacked out by tape. After his family paid a $2.5 million
ransom, Mr. Medina was set free on a Rio street after being
inexplicably presented by one of his kidnappers with a
sparrow in a cage. "I told them I didn't want the sparrow,"
the 41-year-old Mr. Medina recalls. "They told me if I didn't
take it, I wouldn't be set free."
   Although clearly shaken by the experience, Mr. Medina
thinks his kidnapping has contributed to snapping people out
of their complacency toward crime.
   Mr. Medina has talked with Brazil's President Fernando
Collor de Mello to suggest ways to improve security. He is
also doing his bit to try to improve Rio's image.
   Sitting in his office that overlooks the city, he says Rio
is "the most beautiful place in the world. It has a magic, a
musicality," and needs only a spark to renew its past as
cultural and tourism capital of Brazil.
   Mr. Medina is hoping to light that spark and contribute to
its musicality by organizing an eight-day rock festival here
in January. "I want to show the good side of Rio, show that
it's not only violence," he says, adding:"Rio will recover,
like New York did. And rock in Rio will be the starting
point."

   AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Supreme Court ruled that the
state's public utility commission doesn't have authority to
reconsider some $600 million in nuclear plant construction
cost overruns in setting the electric power rates of Gulf
States Utilities Co.
   The court confirmed an earlier lower court ruling that
once the commission set aside those costs in a 1988 rate
case, it couldn't take them up again in a later one. The
costs were presented again in a different format in a 1989
Gulf States rate case; the utility said the commission had
instructed it to resubmit the costs in that case with better
justification.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling didn't disallow the construction costs or rule
on the merits of the original commission decision to set them
aside. It only confirmed a lower court ruling that said by
giving the utility "a second opportunity to prove the same
facts," the public utility commission incorrectly rejected a
hearing examiner's conclusion.
   The costs at issue are part of the New Orleans-based
utility's $3.1 billion investment in the River Bend nuclear
plant in Louisiana. About $1.4 billion of that has been
challenged as not prudent expenditures. The portion of the
overruns considered by Texas regulators amounted to about
$600 million. The remainder applied to the utility's rates in
Louisiana; regulators there have disallowed that portion and
the company is appealing the decision.
   Gulf States said it will seek a rehearing from the Texas
Supreme Court. If that fails, it said it would consider
appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. It also said it would
press pending litigation that it brought against the Texas
commission in 1988, challenging on its merits the agency's
original decision to set aside the costs.
   The utility reiterated previous statements that if all
efforts to have the $1.4 billion considered in its cost
structure fail, it would be forced to take after-tax
write-offs of up to $600 million.

   World Markets:
   Tokyo Stocks Post Gain on Broad-Based Buying;
   U.K. Shares Fall Due to Iran's Call for `Holy War'

   Tokyo stocks rose sharply Wednesday on spurts of
broad-based buying by investment trust funds, traders said.
   In London, stocks fell, as Iran's call for a "holy war"
against the U.S. wiped out earlier gains.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 611.48 points,
or 2.49%, to 25216.14. Volume on the first section was
estimated at 530 million shares, up from 405.9 million shares
Tuesday. Advancers outnumbered decliners 762 to 217, while
144 issues were unchanged.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index inched up another
20.85 points to close the morning session at 25236.99.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section rose 33.02 points, or 1.76%, to 1913.72.
   The Second Section index dropped 11.85 points, or 0.33%,
to 3591.55. Volume in the section was estimated at six
million shares, in line with 5.9 million shares Tuesday.
   Traders also said that futures-related activity picked up
in the second half of the trading day, with both domestic and
foreign brokerage houses unwinding long futures positions and
buying back cash stocks.
   Futures and options traders said that only some
institutional clients are backing the securities firms on the
arbitrage buying, with most of the activity targeted for
house profits.
   Because life insurance companies and other institutions
must pay commissions to the actual arbitragers, the companies
usually don't find it profitable to participate heavily in
arbitrage activity, futures traders said.
   But some institutional investors are still trying to
settle short arbitrage-linked positions, making it possible
that they were buying to cover Wednesday, traders said.
   Straight buying by investment trust funds, which was
scattered in small lots during the morning session but
increased in the afternoon, provided the basis for support on
the cash indexes, participants said.
   Traders estimated that 100 billion yen to 300 billion yen
($712.9 million to $2.14 billion) of funds may hit the market
by the end of the week.
   Although well-absorbed by the investment trust and
arbitrage buying Wednesday, arbitrage selling all day and
general bearishness in the morning about interest rates and
higher oil prices confronted the buying, traders said.
   The stock market was a little moody at the beginning of
the day because Japanese government bonds had opened weaker
after a softer performance overseas, traders said. But a
sharp appreciation by the yen sparked short-covering in the
bond market, soothing stock market sentiment in the
afternoon.
   Stock transactions were thin and swift, meanwhile, as much
of the day's activity was dealer-driven and based on
speculative or incentive-backed shares, traders said.
   Also, because Thursday is the last day of trading for
September futures and options contracts, while Friday is the
special quotation for those contracts, stock traders
reiterated that volatility can be expected.
   Steel shares were sharply higher. Daido Steel jumped 40
yen to 715 yen, Kawasaki Steel rose 28 yen to 458 yen, Kobe
Steel gained 37 yen to 527 yen, and Nisshin Steel was up 17
yen to 665 yen.
   Several speculative issues continued to attract buying
interest. For example, Sanrio rose 260 yen to 6360 yen and
Jujo Paper rose 50 yen to 670 yen.
   Oil and related product shares also rose, with Nippon Oil
up 20 yen to 1070 yen, Showa Shell up 80 yen to 1130 yen, and
Mitsui Petrochemical up 34 yen to 824 yen.
   Some construction shares also gained. Misawa Homes rose 50
yen to 1950 yen, Maeda Construction was up 70 yen to 1640
yen, and Ohbayashi rose 50 yen to 1290 yen.
   Gains on blue-chip issues were less impressive, however.
Pioneer rose 70 yen to 4850 yen and Fujitsu gained 30 yen to
1210 yen. But TDK fell 70 yen to 5680 yen and Sony dropped 20
yen to 7020 yen.
   Shipbuilding, real estate and financial issues rose.
   London traders said it was difficult to assess the
direction of that market, and that decisions could be made
only on a minute-by-minute basis.
   Prior to the Iran's call for war, London traders reported
general institutional buying. "Institutional cash piles were
beginning to look slightly embarrassing," one trader said.
However, profit-taking set in after the news, forcing the
London market lower, traders added.
   One trader said that the London Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 Share Index still needed to drop 30 points to
generate buying interest, and to allow London to fall closer
in line with Wall Street.
   Wednesday, the FT-SE 100 fell two points to 2142.3. The
Financial Times 30 Share Index was down 7.7 points at 1643.3.
Volume was 434.7 million shares, up from Tuesday's 338.8
million shares.
   Traders said that BTR PLC, an industrial holding company,
was the main feature of the market. Although the half-year
pretax profit rose 6.6% to #530 million ($983.1 million), the
figure failed to match expectations. BTR plunged 40 pence to
318 pence.
   Among other companies disclosing half-year results,
insurance giant Prudential PLC reported a decline in pretax
profit of 35% following claims involving winter storm damage.
The stock managed to gain 4 pence to 208 pence on the back of
optimistic expectations for overseas units.
   British Aerospace PLC posted a 0.7% fall in pretax profit
to #146 million, but remained optimistic about full-year
earnings. The shares gained 11 pence to 563 pence.
   In the wake of Iran's call for a holy war, oil prices
rallied and Lasmo gained 12 pence to 481 pence. Enterprise
Oil climbed 9 pence to 678 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Frankfurt, Zurich,
Milan and Brussels, lower in Paris and Madrid, mixed in
Amsterdam, and flat in Stockholm. South African gold stocks
edged up.
   Shares also ended higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei,
Wellington and Singapore, and lower in Manila and Seoul.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   Ford Foundation Offers
   Grants to Fight Racism

   The Ford Foundation launched a program to help combat
racism on college campuses.
   The foundation announced $1.6 million in grants to help 19
colleges and universities add courses that deal more directly
with such issues as cultural diversity, ethnic heritage and
racial oppression. The initiative comes at a time when many
campuses -- and the nation as a whole -- are dealing with
outbreaks of racial prejudice and tension.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "To reach the roots of intolerance and improve campus
life, we must make the teaching of non-Western cultures a
basic element of undergraduate education, said Franklin
Thomas, president of the New York foundation. "The minority
population under the age of 18 in the U.S. has risen from 15%
in the 1950s to 36% today, and the number is still growing.
As the face of America changes, education must help American
students learn to live and work together," he said.
   Foundation officials said that the grants are just the
first step in what will be a multiyear program involving
other institutions.

   ServiceMaster Has
   Accord With Waste
   Management Inc.

   DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. -- ServiceMaster L.P. and Waste
Management Inc. agreed in principle to form a new pest
control, cleaning service and lawn-care joint venture by
combining operations with total revenue of about $920
million.
   The two suburban Chicago companies said the venture, to be
known as ServiceMaster Consumer Services Limited Partnership,
will operate as a unit of ServiceMaster.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The planned partnership will consist of Waste Management's
pest-control business and TruGreen lawn-care business.
ServiceMaster will contribute its consumer services business,
including its residential and commercial cleaning services,
the Terminix termite and pest control businesses, the Merry
Maids maid business and the American Home Shield home
warranty business.
   The agreement calls for Waste Management to receive common
equity in the partnership representing 20% of the total
equity and a preferred interest convertible into another 2.1%
of the common equity of the partnership, according to the
companies. ServiceMaster will initially hold 80% of the
common equity.
   The two businesses that Waste Management is contributing
had 1989 revenue of $170 million, and ServiceMaster's
contribution of a mix of franchise and company run businesses
had over $750 million in consumer level revenue for the same
period.
   Waste Management said it valued the two businesses it
contributed, and the value of the partnership interest and
convertible preferred it will receive, at about $180 million,
giving the venture an indicated total value of about $818
million.
   ServiceMaster, a health care and cleaning concern which
had $1.5 billion in revenue last year, said the partnership
was "a great addition" that would make Terminix the leading
pest control business in the country.
   For Waste Management, the nation's largest collector of
municipal garbage with over $4.4 billion in revenue, the
agreement will rid the company of the responsibility of
running its consumer services business, while maintaining an
equity position.
   Under the agreement, ServiceMaster and Waste Management
will develop and participate in joint marketing efforts in
both the consumer services and management services areas.
Waste Management will be represented on the venture's board,
but won't participate in day-to-day management.
   "We're going to continue to focus on environmental
services and ServiceMaster is going to focus on consumer
services, and our shareholders will participate," in earnings
from the operations it is contributing, said a Waste
Management spokesman. "That's why we didn't sell" the
operations, he added.
   The transaction is subject to approval of both company's
boards. The companies said they expect to reach a definitive
agreement by the end of the year.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, ServiceMaster closed at $22, up 75 cents, and Waste
Management closed at $35.50, down 75 cents.

   New York City $850 Million Bond Issue Sells Out

   NEW YORK -- Yields that topped 8% attracted a large number
of individual buyers to New York City's $850 million general
obligation bond issue.
   But the high yield, which translates into a taxable
equivalent yield of more than 12% for many individuals,
wasn't high enough to lure many big investors. Dealers said
institutions considered the yields too low in light of New
York City's financial troubles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still, officials at lead underwriter Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
said the issue was oversubscribed due to strong demand by
individual investors.
   "We had very strong retail demand throughout," said Dan
Keating, senior managing director of municipal underwriting
at Bear Stearns. "Institutional business was scattered in the
shorter and longer maturities."
   The New York City issue was priced to yield from 6.50% for
two-year notes to 8.05% for 30-year bonds. Moody's Investors
Service Inc. confirmed a single-A rating on the issue while
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. confirmed a single-A-minus rating.
   Investor reaction to the New York City sale spilled over
into the rest of the municipal bond market, helping
tax-exempts to outperform the broader bond market.
   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point
higher, a gain of $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
But Treasury, corporate and mortgage-backed bonds ended
unchanged to as much of 1/8 point lower in quiet trading. The
yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.94%
from 8.92% on Tuesday.
   Mitchell Held, economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said the Treasury market opened with a "nice little
runup," which reflected optimism that congressional
negotiators would soon forge a credible budget-reduction
plan. That was considered good for bonds because many
economist argue that a smaller budget deficit could lead to
lower interest rates.
   But later in the day, bond prices slid on news that Iran's
spiritual leader, Ali Khameni, said that the U.S. military
presence in the Middle East justifies a Moslem jihad, or holy
war.
   Mr. Held said the pronouncements raised the specter of
still higher oil prices. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,
crude oil futures contracts for October delivery settled at
$30.97 a barrel, up 21 cents on the day.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Yields topping 8% attracted many individual buyers to New
York City's $850 million general obligation bond issue.
   But the high yield, which translates into a taxable
equivalent yield of more than 12% for many individuals,
wasn't high enough to lure many institutional investors.
Dealers said the institutions considered the yields too low
in light of New York City's financial troubles. Still,
officials at lead underwriter Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said the
issue was oversubscribed.
   The New York City issue was priced to yield from 6.50% for
two-year notes to 8.05% for 30-year bonds. Moody's Investors
Service Inc. confirmed a single-A rating on the issue while
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. confirmed a Single-A-Minus rating.
   In competitive action, an issue of $100 million Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power electric plant revenue
bonds sold out immediately after they were purchased by a BT
Securities Corp. group, officials at the firm reported. BT
Securities is a unit of Bankers Trust Corp.
   The bonds, rated double-A by Moody's and S&amp;P, were priced
for reoffering to yield from 6.40% for six-year notes to
7.39% for 30-year bonds.
   Meanwhile, Swiss Bank Corp. said it would not back $50
million of Philadelphia temporary loan notes. Philadelphia
had been expected to sell about $375 million of the notes
this week, with proceeds intended to keep the city afloat
financially until tax collections begin. Without the note
sale, Philadelphia officials have said the city will run out
of cash later this month.
   "The deal has definitely been postponed," said Alan
Schankel, first vice president and manager of the municipal
bond department at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia. "I think they'll go back to the drawing board
and try everything," such as trying to obtain another letter
of credit or getting the state more involved with the sale,
he said.
   Mr. Schankel quoted Philadelphia general obligation bonds
8 1/4% due in 2009 as trading late yesterday at 96 to yield
about 8.60%. Trading halted for about one hour after the
Swiss Bank news. After it resumed, bond yields rose slightly
before returning to the 8.60% level.
   Elsewhere yesterday, most municipal bonds were unchanged
to 1/8 point higher.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended at a price of 97
28/32 to yield 8.94% compared with 98 2/32 to yield 8.92% on
Tuesday. The latest two-year notes ended unchanged at 100
5/32 to yield 8.02%.
   Short-term securities were lower yesterday. The discount
rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.37% for a bond
equivalent yield of 7.59% while the rate on six-month bills
fell to 7.30% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.66%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Resolution Trust Corp.'s junk-bond sales put a damper
on the high-yield market, sending prices moderately lower.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, fell 1/4 to 1/2
point.
   The declines came after the RTC sold $70 million of junk
bonds Tuesday and was seeking to sell another $40 million of
high-yield bonds yesterday.
   A spokeswoman for the RTC, the federal agency set up to
bail out the nation's troubled thrifts, said the RTC managed
to sell between two-thirds and three-quarters of the $40
million in bonds. "We could have sold them all but we were
not happy with the prices," she said.
   Although the spokeswoman declined to say which junk bonds
the RTC was trying to liquidate, dealers said the list
included a number of cable TV companies, including Century
Communications Co., American Cablesystem and Comcast Corp. On
Monday, the House passed a bill that would regulate cable TV
rates for basic service and assist emerging competitors.
   Among the big losers in the high-yield market were junk
bonds of AmBase Corp., which plunged a day after the company
said its Home Insurance Co. unit has discontinued
negotiations to sell US International Reinsurance Co.
   AmBase's 14.875% senior subordinated notes, maturing in
1998, tumbled six points to 61.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds ended unchanged to slightly lower.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage securities ended with slim gains.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue
for September delivery rose 2/32 to 98 7/8. The 9 1/2%
securities of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal
National Mortgage Association each rose 3/32 to 98 14/32 and
99, respectively.
   Lehman Brothers announced the pricing of a $300 million
Fannie Mae real estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic,
issue. The 16-class deal, Series 1990-123, is backed by
Fannie Mae's 9 1/2% securities. Details were not immediately
available.

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The World Bank managed to sell its third and largest
global bond issue yesterday but underwriters said it wasn't
easy.
   The $2 billion of 8 5/8% five-year notes were priced
within expectations but the latest tremors from the Persian
Gulf, coupled with tough market conditions, nearly derailed
smooth placement.
   "This was a deal which people had to work for," said
Walter Henniges, head of syndication at Deutsche Bank Capital
Markets Ltd., the joint lead underwriter with Salomon
Brothers International Ltd. "The Treasury market was very
nervous and this was a very difficult market to work in."
   In addition to negative talk from Iran, underwriters had
to contend with lukewarm demand from Japanese investors. The
dollar's weakness and the prospect of lower rates in the U.S.
while Japanese yields are increasing muted demand.
   European investors, who have previously been more willing
to buy World Bank bonds than U.S. or Japanese investors,
picked up only 35% of the issue.
   West German and British government bonds closed moderately
lower after earlier gains were wiped out after an Iranian
call for a "holy war" against the U.S. presence in the Middle
East.
   In Japan, government bonds rose.

   Cambridge Capital Fund L.P., which holds 14.1% of
Whitehall Corp., said it may seek seats on Whitehall's board
even though it lost a proxy contest in May.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Cambridge
said it is concerned about the continuing deterioration in
Whitehall's operations. Last month, Whitehall reported a
second-quarter loss of $359,000, or 11 cents a share,
compared with year-earlier profit of $380,000, or 11 cents a
share. Revenue fell 53% to $4.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cambridge said it is considering the solicitation of
written consents from holders, or the calling of a special
meeting, to remove some or all of Whitehall's directors and
replace them with its own nominees.
   Whitehall officials couldn't be reached. A Cambridge
attorney wouldn't comment.
   In the filing, Cambridge also said it raised its stake to
14.1%, or 478,300 shares, including 23,600 shares bought from
Aug. 24 to Tuesday at $11.50 to $12.125 each.

   Landmark Land Co., Carmel, Calif., said federal regulators
subjected its Oak Tree Savings Bank unit to operating
restrictions because of insufficient capital.
   Landmark said the "supervisory agreement" includes limits
on new lending and certain other actions, including the
payment of dividends and the hiring of directors and
employees, without clearance from the federal Office of
Thrift Supervision. Landmark said the restrictions are
customary for thrifts that fail to meet higher capital
standards established under last year's thrift-bailout law.
It added that Oak Tree, based in New Orleans, had already
been curtailing its lending since the beginning of the year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Landmark also said that it received "several proposals" in
reply to a plan to sell much of Oak Tree's real-estate
holdings but that it couldn't predict whether a sale would be
completed. An earlier agreement to sell nearly $1 billion in
real estate to developer Barry Hon collapsed because of
regulatory objections.

   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- Gary Lieberthal, chairman of the
television division of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.,
signed a new long-term employment agreement and will be
elected to the board of directors of Columbia, a Sony Corp.
unit.
   Mr. Lieberthal is the only head of a major Columbia
division to remain in his post after Sony's purchase of
Columbia late last year. Peter Guber and Jon Peters took over
as co-chairmen of Columbia soon after the purchase,
succeeding Victor Kaufman, who resigned. Messrs. Guber and
Peters subsequently recruited Frank Price to head the
Columbia Pictures unit, succeeding Dawn Steel, who resigned.
Mike Medavoy was chosen to run the Tri-Star Pictures unit
after Jeff Sagansky left to run CBS Inc.'s Entertainment
Division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While Columbia's movie operations had been plagued by
management turnover and box office flops prior to the Sony
purchase, the television operation has been stable and
successful since Mr. Lieberthal took the helm in 1987.
Profits from the television operation have carried the movie
business through numerous losing seasons, and Columbia
Pictures Television is considered one of the company's most
valuable assets, with a library of nearly 25,000 television
episodes.
   Columbia's current television series include "Who's the
Boss?," "Married . . . With Children" and "Designing Women."
Mr. Lieberthal joined the television division in 1986, when
Columbia acquired Embassy Communications Inc., where he was
chairman and chief executive.

   Accountants' Panel
   Drops Its Proposal
   On Frequent Fliers
   ----

   An accounting panel abandoned a proposal that would have
required airlines to reflect much higher costs on their books
for the millions of unused frequent-flier travel coupons the
carriers have outstanding.
   Meeting in Seattle, the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants deliberated over a proposal that would have
required airlines to adopt two different methods of
accounting for frequent-flier liabilities. But "we terminated
the project," said John L. Kreischer, chairman of the
15-member committee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A special task force of institute accountants spent two
years studying frequent-flier accounting methods. The
proposal abandoned yesterday called for airlines to use both
incremental-cost and deferred-revenue accounting methods.
   The first allows airlines to set aside money for
liabilities based on its incremental cost -- that is, the
cost of flying a frequent flier in an otherwise empty seat.
The second requires that at a future time, airlines must
account for frequent-flier miles based on the price of the
revenue that would be lost from displacing a paying
passenger.
   Currently, each airline determines its own frequent-flier
liabilities, based on incremental costs for each additional
nonfare paying passenger. These costs include food, fuel and
handling; the airlines also take into account the rates at
which the frequent-flier coupons are redeemed.
   The debate is extremely important to all airlines, which
have opposed changing the accounting rules for frequent-flier
programs.
   The travel awards have become tremendously popular since
they were created in 1981, but they've left airlines with
significant liabilities. According to an internal study by
the BusinessFlyer, a newsletter on frequent-travel awards,
airlines have a total 34.6 billion frequent-flier miles
outstanding.
   John Holland, the newsletter's publisher, says that
redemption rates are rising, but still only 26% of the
mileage under the awards is redeemed. Forcing airlines to
reserve for all mileage that might be redeemed could double
the industry's liabilities outstanding to $4.7 billion and
might even threaten some carriers' solvency.
   Still, some accountants argue that as frequent-flier
programs have skyrocketed, airlines are incurring huge
potential future liabilities and aren't accurately reflecting
such liabilities on their books.
   Mr. Kreischer said the committee decided to abandon the
dual-method proposal because it did not want to provoke a
battle with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
body that has final say over accounting standards for the
airline and other industries.
   Through prior meetings, Mr. Kreischer said, AICPA members
determined that the FASB prefers only the deferred-accounting
method of recording frequent-flier liabilities.
   "We felt (the dual method) was a reasonable position, but
we didn't want to go counter to the FASB," Mr. Kreischer
said. The panel "agrees in principle" with the
deferred-revenue method, but it wanted to go a step further
to allow for travel awards that are not redeemed.
   The FASB now must decide whether to battle the airlines
over the issue, Mr. Kreischer said.
   Dennis R. Beresford, chairman of the FASB, said he was
somewhat surprised by the outcome of the AICPA meeting. After
working with the AICPA task force, he anticipated that the
group would go along with the FASB's strong preference for a
single deferred-revenue method.
   Mr. Beresford maintains that this method more-accurately
reflects the economics of frequent-flier transactions. Mr.
Beresford added that it is too early to say whether the FASB
will take up the matter further. "It sounds like they (the
AICPA) have passed the buck. We have to decide whether we
want to accept it,"he said.

   Southeast didn't say how much of a capital gain it will

million "is in the ballpark."
   Ida Roberts, the Southeast spokeswoman, said the company
will give further details of the transaction when it reports
its third-quarter results, probably in the second week of
October.
   For Sears Mortgage, the deal gives it a deeper presence in
Florida, a fast-growing market where it previously had nine
loan origination offices. It said the purchase of servicing
rights on the 83,000 loans increased its servicing portfolio
to 190,000 loans totaling $14 billion.
   Southeast's move is aimed at shoring up capital at the

   Under the agreement, Ecolab will pay $74 million and
Henkel will receive 5.6 million shares of Ecolab's common
stock. Each company will hold a 50% stake in the joint
venture company, Henkel-Ecolab, which will have revenue of
about $750 million.
   Henkel, a chemical products and packaging concern, will
have representation on Ecolab's board proportionate to its
stock ownership. Ecolab currently has 23.5 million common
shares outstanding.
   Henkel will also get back the $110 million it paid for its
initial investment in Ecolab. In December Ecolab sold Henkel
1.1 million shares of 7% Series A convertible preferred
stock. Ecolab said the shares will be retired.
   The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals
and is expected to be completed early next year.

   Commodities:
   Grain Prices Expected to Tumble Today as U.S.
   Boosts Output Estimates for '90 Corn, Wheat Crops

   The prospect of record yields forced the Agriculture
Department to boost its production estimates for the 1990
corn and wheat crops.
   The new estimates are expected to trigger a major selling
spree this morning in the commodity markets, driving down
grain prices anywhere from three cents to five cents a
bushel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The department, in its most definitive 1990 crop forecast
yet, said it expects U.S. farmers to harvest 8.12 billion
bushels of corn, up 3% from last month's estimate and up 8%
from last year's actual production. Corn yields are projected
to average a record 121.7 bushels an acre, four bushels more
than forecast last month.
   At the same time, the department boosted its forecast of
wheat production by 2% to 2.76 billion bushels in light of a
record spring wheat crop of 581 million bushels projected for
this fall. A bumper winter wheat crop already is in the bins.
As a result, department analysts expect average yields for
all wheat to equal the record 39.4 bushels an acre, set in
1983.
   Soybean production was forecast at 1.83 billion bushels,
essentially unchanged from last month's estimate. Some market
analysts had expected a drop in the estimate, but drought
damage to the soybean crop in the Mississippi Delta during
August was offset by good growing conditions in the Midwest.
   In Chicago, analysts said corn futures prices would be
down about five cents a bushel at the start of trading today.
Over the next few days, they said, the corn prices could
plunge as much as 20 cents a bushel.
   The department's new corn forecast was unexpected. Most
analysts had estimated a harvest of 7,968,000,000 bushels;
the highest estimate called for 8,108,000,000.
   "These figures are amazing, especially when you plant as
late as we did this year," said Daniel Basse, director of
market research for AgResource Co., Chicago.
   The new yield estimate of 121.7 bushels of corn an acre
surpasses the previous high of 119.8 bushels an acre reached
in 1987. Very favorable weather in July and August helped
counteract a soggy June, which kept many farmers from
planting until well after usual corn-planting deadlines.
   Typically, record yields occur in the second year after a
drought, analysts said. Although 1988 was a drought year, no
one had expected the pattern to hold this year, because of
the late planting.
   The department's report on wheat yields and wheat
stockpiles is likely to force down wheat futures prices --
and increase pressure on the Bush administration to do
whatever it can to prop up wheat prices.
   The report predicted that U.S. wheat stockpiles will total
946 million bushels on June 30, 1991, up sharply from 535
million bushels last June 30. The record spring wheat crop
and weakening export prospects prompted department analysts
to raise their stockpile forecast by 100 million bushels from
last month.
   If the administration doesn't extend credit guarantees to
foreign countries for additional wheat purchases, the number
of acres planted this fall with winter wheat will have to be
curtailed to avoid further price-depressing surpluses,
analysts said.
   On Tuesday, the Senate approved a bill introduced by Sen.
Bob Dole (R., Kan.) that would require farmers enrolled in
the government's subsidy program to idle 15% of their 1991
wheat acreage. The bill also would urge Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter to give farmers the option of setting aside
additional acreage in return for government payments. Similar
legislation is pending in the House.
   Mr. Yeutter has said he can't announce an exact set-aside
figure because of discrepancies between House and Senate
versions of the 1990 farm bill, which haven't yet been
reconciled by conferees. Mr. Dole's bill and a bill submitted
by Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) are designed to give farmers
timely guidance on how much wheat to plant this fall.
   But there's nothing lawmakers can do to avert the sell-off
foreseen for the markets today. Even soybeans will be
affected, analysts said. While soybean futures prices are
expected to remain strong over the long term, they are
expected to plunge today in sympathy with corn and wheat.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose, mostly in response to a
strong London market. The soonest-to-expire September
contract advanced 1.10 cents a pound to $1.3590, while the
most-active December was up 0.20 cent to $1.2875. The premium
of September over December widened by 0.90 cent to 7.15 cents
a pound. In London, the premium of the cash position on the
London Metal Exchange over the three-months delivery doubled
to about 10 cents a pound; the cash position was quoted at
$3,365 a metric ton, and the three-months delivery was at
$2,943 a ton. Analysts expressed surprise and puzzlement at
the strength in London, which they said wasn't justified by
market fundamentals. However, William O'Neill, senior futures
strategist for Merrill Lynch, noted that "the European copper
market is stronger than the one in the U.S. Japan has been a
continuous buyer in London. European demand for copper
remains at a comparatively high level, particularly from West
Germany, and it isn't significantly reflecting any evidence
of an economic slowdown." European metal dealers kept their
supplies low and have been buying copper only as needed while
waiting for copper prices to peak out from the current rally,
Mr. O'Neill said. "Now, it appears that the dealers' supplies
may have been smaller than was thought and they're having to
come in to buy copper to fulfill continued industrial demand.
This has helped boost prices," he said.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices closed higher yesterday
after jumping late in what had been a dull trading day at the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Light sweet crude for October
delivery ended at $30.97 a barrel, up 21 cents. Petroleum
product prices finished mixed, as gasoline prices moved
higher along with crude prices futures late in the session.
Heating oil futures ended lower. A report released by the
American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday should have
produced a more bearish response in the marketplace. However,
concern over the Middle East continued to provide some
support for prices. The industry report showed that
distillate stocks had grown by 5.0 million barrels to 131.7
million barrels last week. Crude oil stocks increased 2.1
million barrels to 374.3 million barrels, while gasoline
stocks rose 650,000 barrels to 211.1 million barrels.
However, traders perceived President Bush's speech Tuesday
night as well as Iran's overtures to Iraq as hawkish and
declined to sell heavily in the face of such news.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: The soonest-to-expire October futures contract
rose strongly, while most other months were moderately
higher. October ended with a gain of 1.73 cents a pound at
73.90 cents, after climbing its daily limit of two cents a
pound shortly before the close. Continuous rain in the
southern part of the Mississippi Delta, a major
cotton-growing area, has delayed the crop, according to
Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache
Securities. The rains began sporadically last week, have been
steady this week and are expected to continue into the
weekend, he said. "This means the crop in that area, instead
of being early as had been expected, will be collected at
about the usual time," he explained. "As a consequence, there
will be very little or any to deliver against the October
contract on the exchange." The first day for the issuance of
notices to deliver cotton against the October contract is
Sept. 24. There are 1,194 bales of cotton currently in
warehouses of the New York Cotton Exchange that have been
certificated for delivery against futures contracts, Mr.
Simon noted. In contrast, the number of outstanding October
contracts that remain to be nullified by an opposite trade or
satisfied by delivery of the commodity amount to the
equivalent of 277,500 bales. The number of outstanding
contracts, known as the open interest, "isn't particularly
large as such, but it's huge compared with the amount of
cotton in storage for delivery against" the expiring October
contract, Mr. Simon said. Separately, the analyst said the
Agriculture Department crop report, issued after the close of
trading, was about neutral for cotton. The department
estimated U.S. cotton production for the 1990-91 season,
which began Sept. 1, at 14.7 million bales, only 142,000
bales less than the August estimate. "That wasn't a
significant difference," Mr. Simon said. Output in 1989-90
was 12.2 million bales. The report showed little change for
world cotton production from the August estimate, and it said
that a 200,000-ton increase expected in U.S. mill use of
cotton would be offset by a drop of the same amount in U.S.
exports this season.

   Troubled Equimark Corp., Pittsburgh, was hit with a
shareholder lawsuit, alleging that the bank-holding company
concealed its bad loans.
   The suit, filed by one shareholder as a class-action
complaint, also alleges Equimark misled the public into
believing it would achieve consistent growth and earnings.
And the suit claims that Equimark overstated its profits for
the past several years by failing to set adequate reserves
for loan losses.

   An Equimark spokeswoman said she hadn't seen the suit and
couldn't comment on it.
   The suit comes one week after Alan S. Fellheimer announced
his resignation as chairman of Equimark. He left amid
criticism for his overly ambitious growth strategy, brusque
management style and mounting losses.
   The suit named Mr. Fellheimer and several current and
former executives as defendants, including Mr. Fellheimer's
wife, Judith. Mrs. Fellheimer was a high-ranking executive
who left Equimark earlier this year.

   The House voted overwhelmingly to require heftier military

any post-Cold War defense arrangements.
   The provisions, approved during debate on a $283 billion

   The actions are the clearest signal yet that lawmakers are
determined to make long-term, fundamental changes in how the
Pentagon bases and pays for U.S. forces overseas. The
short-term effect, however, depends on whether the Senate
goes along with the House approach. The White House and
Pentagon oppose the House language.
   Meanwhile, lawmakers in the next few days are expected to
receive details about a proposal to sell to Saudi Arabia an
arms package substantially larger than the Pentagon or Saudi
officials previously indicated. Some defense industry
officials estimated that the proposed sales could total as
much as $20 billion -- about twice as large as the packages
disclosed previously -- if the White House doesn't pare the
Saudi request for political reasons.
   In yesterday's action on the defense bill, the House voted
370-to-53 to adopt an amendment requiring Tokyo to pay the
entire $5 billion estimated annual cost of keeping 50,000
U.S. troops and their dependents in Japan. If Japanese
officials balk, the amendment requires the U.S. to reduce its
forces in that country by 5,000 soldiers each year.
   Reflecting the frustration of many lawmakers, Rep. David
Bonior (D., Mich.) said: "History has shown that we need to
be tough to get action from Japan."
   For the first time since World War II, the House also
voted to require the Pentagon to draft plans for so-called
dual basing of troops in Japan, West Germany and other
nations. Under this concept, most of the Army and Air Force
units stationed overseas, as well as their dependents, would
be brought back to U.S. bases. Small contingents of troops
would return without their dependents periodically for
training and military exercises during six-month tours, but
the cost of keeping them overseas would be far less than
under the current system.
   The Senate version of the bill doesn't contain such
provisions, and senior members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee have favored a more gradual approach to burden
sharing.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.), the main sponsor of
the dual-basing provision, said the U.S. currently is paying
to keep more than 300,000 troops to protect West Germany from
East German forces, while "all of the East Germans are
shopping in West Germany at the malls . . . . It doesn't make
any sense."
   In another section of the authorization bill, the House
agreed to set up a bipartisan commission, similar to one
created under the Reagan administration, to recommend which
domestic bases should be closed as overall Pentagon spending
declines. But the language effectively prohibits closing any
bases for two years. Critics contend that would tie the hands
of Pentagon officials and permit parochial interests to fight
for jobs by keeping unnecessary bases in operation.
   When the House resumes debate today on the bill, one of
its most controversial provisions isn't expected to come to a
vote. Proponents of the B-2 Stealth bomber, which the bill
proposes to kill, have decided they don't want to risk a
lopsided defeat on the House floor. Instead, they will rely
on supporters in the Senate to try to keep the radar-eluding
plane alive in a conference committee.
   The B-2 will survive the conference "if we have a good
strong commitment from the administration" for the program,
predicted Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.) "But it's sometimes
hard to know what that commitment is."
   The White House has threatened to veto the defense bill if
it kills the B-2, sharply restricts funding for Star Wars
antimissile research and cuts too deeply into uniformed
personnel.
   Efforts to fashion a defense bill have been complicated by
uncertainties over the outcome of the current budget talks
between Congress and the White House. In addition, lawmakers
haven't decided how to factor in the expected
multibillion-dollar cost of military operations in the Middle
East.
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D.,
Wis.), for example, has been pushing to include the funds as
part of a later supplemental appropriations measure. Other
House leaders want to earmark at least $7 billion for the
operation as part of the 1991 bill.
   For the Saudi arms deal, U.S. defense industry officials
said the Bush administration is planning to request expedited
congressional approval to sell the Saudis about 24 F-15
fighters and 48 Apache tank-destructing helicopters, both
made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. The package, according to
these officials, also is slated to include Bradley Fighting
Vehicles, built by FMC Corp.; Patriot air-defense missiles
built by Raytheon Co.; as well as trucks and other support
equipment.

   Honda Motor Co., Gardena, Calif., said it is raising base
prices on several 1991 models as much as 7.2%, although it is
freezing prices on some versions.
   The biggest price increase is on the Prelude 2.0 Si. The
1991 model will have a base price of $14,945, up 7.2% from a
year earlier. Honda said spokesmen weren't immediately
available to comment on the reason for the move.

<TEXT>
   The Japanese auto maker is boosting the price on its most
expensive Prelude, the Si four-speed equipped with automatic
transmission, 4.9% to $19,450. Honda said it will also raise
the base price on its 1991 Civic three-door hatchback to
$6,895, up 3.9% from a year earlier.
   The auto maker isn't changing prices on some other 1991
models, including the CRX HF and the CRX Si.
   Honda said that, on average, its 1991-model base reflect
an increase of 1%, or $140 a car. That average includes a
modest increase on the Accord, the top-selling car model in
the U.S. Its base price, announced earlier, will increase
$200, or 1.6%, from the 1990 model.

   Congress Likely
   To Allow Rise
   In FDIC Fees

   Bank Industry Is Preparing
   To Fight Move, Saying
   It May Be Overreaction

   Already reeling from the enormity of the thrift bailout,
Congress appears likely to give regulators the authority to
boost bank-deposit insurance premiums, probably before its
current session ends.
   But bank experts worry that the lawmakers may overreact
and argue that increasing the insurance premiums carries
risks of its own.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Congressional Budget Office told the Senate Banking
Committee that, given current trends, it expects 600 to 700
bank failures to occur by 1993, dragging the insurance fund
down to about $4 billion, its lowest point ever, from its
current $13.2 billion. (There are 13,200 commercial banks and
mutual savings banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.) A similar report warning of weakness in the insurance
fund was issued by the General Accounting Office Tuesday.
   The two reports leave the impression that the banking
industry is in worse shape than it really is, bank analysts
say. The banking industry is expected to lobby hard against
another rise in the premiums they pay, arguing that Congress
is overreacting to avoid any potential recriminations if
conditions do worsen.
   Lobbyists for the industry attributed the reports to a
Congress shaken to its core by the savings and loan bailout.
"The GAO numbers aren't a surprise to people who've been
studying this for a time," said Robert Dugger, chief
economist for the American Bankers Association. "But I think
there is a lot of alarming rhetoric being associated with
it."
   The lobbyists, and even the government auditors, note that
a premium increase carries risks of its own, including a
possible worsening of the credit crunch. "An overreaction by
Congress or the regulators could result in further downward
pressure in these already weak economic areas," said Mr.
Dugger.
   Real estate loans, especially in the Northeast, and the
increasing cash flow problems of many highly leveraged
companies in the face of a possible recession are clearly
worrisome. But most analysts say a repeat of the thrift
industry collapse is not likely for banks, especially as
commercial banks are much better capitalized as a group and
are still earning decent profits for the most part.
   And although it is tough for banks to raise long-term debt
and equity, short-term funds are still readily available for
all but the handful of large troubled banks, said Gregory
Root, president of Keefe BankWatch, a bank rating agency
followed closely by money market investors.
   Anxiety over the bank fund has Congress and the
administration in agreement that the regulators should be
permitted to raise bank insurance premiums. The Treasury
Department, which had kept its silence as it prepares a
deposit insurance reform package at year end, said it will
introduce narrow legislation designed for speedy passage.
Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas),
chairman of the House Banking Committee, also have endorsed
the idea.
   "In my opinion, failure to enact such legislation before
Congress adjourns in October could leave the FDIC powerless
to take actions that may be necessary to protect the bank
insurance fund should the economy continue to slow this
winter," said Sen. Riegle.
   Congress, facing scathing S&amp;L criticism, is likely to act
soon to increase the insurance premium authority. "We'd fool
ourselves if we thought there wasn't going to be plenty of
problems in the banks," said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.),
a member of the House Banking Committee. "It might be better
to make the banks pay more now than have the taxpayers pay
later."
   The FDIC has already raised insurance premiums to the
statutory limit, including a recently announced 4.5-cent
increase for each $100 of deposits, which will take effect
next year. This represented 7.3% of the industry's 1989 net
income of $15 billion, after nonrecurring gains. After the
increase, the banks will pay 19.5 cents a year per $100 of
deposits.
   Regulators aren't yet saying what they would do with
broader authority to raise insurance premiums. "We'll be
studying it, obviously," said William Seidman, chairman of
the FDIC, which manages both the bank and thrift deposit
insurance funds. Mr. Seidman recently wrote to Mr. Gonzalez
endorsing the plan to allow greater flexibility with
premiums.
   What makes the reports this week seem ominous for banks is
that the publicity generated did not note that the FDIC fund
covers many large mutual savings banks, which are owned by
their depositors and are part of the thrift industry.
Analysts say there is a greater chance of several large
savings banks failing in the near future than big commercial
banks. Indeed, analysts say the picture is not nearly as
bleak for the commercial banking industry.
   Helping to bolster the banking industry through its
growing problems, says James McDermott, director of research
at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, is its access to relatively
inexpensive deposits. Many banks are buying the deposits of
failed savings institutions at less than it costs to purchase
funds in the open market.
   Consultant William Isaac, a former FDIC chairman, suggests
several alternatives to a premium increase. One would be a
special premium of 1% of deposits that banks would turn over
to the FDIC to get the fund up to 1.7% of total deposits.
That extra premium would pay interest to the banks and be
refunded once the fund reached the desired level of 1.25% of
deposits on its own. He also suggests diverting to the FDIC
fund the money earned by the Federal Reserve for the
non-interest bearing reserves banks now keep at the Fed.
Currently the $15 billion or more earned each year on those
reserves are turned over to the Treasury.
   The deposit insurance fund isn't in as much imminent
danger as the new warnings would indicate, says the FDIC's
John Bovenzi, deputy to Mr. Seidman. Mr. Bovenzi said his
agency "has a problem" with the GAO saying that the $13.2
billion FDIC fund could be tapped for $8 billion of
liabilities from previous Southwest bank failures. Those
assets, composed mostly of problem loans that are being
managed by solvent financial institutions, have already been
marked to market, that is, their losses have already been
reflected by the fund.

   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it agreed to pay about $45
million as part of a plan to clean up a hazardous waste
landfill in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   The plan, proposed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y.,
calls for Occidental to build and operate for about $25
million a containment and waste-extraction system at the
S-Area landfill, which was operated by Hooker Chemical Co.,
acquired by Occidental in 1968. The site is where 63,000 tons
of hazardous waste were disposed, according to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. The system is expected to be
completed in 1996.

<TEXT>
   In addition, Los Angeles based Occidental has agreed to
spend $64.9 million over a 20-year period to build with the
city a new $67.8 million drinking water treatment plant on a
site adjacent to the landfill, according to Thomas L.
Jennings, vice president for environmental affairs at
Occidental's chemical operations. These funds were diverted
from a plan to clean up the existing water plant on the same
site.
   Aside from Occidental Chemical Corp. and the EPA, other
parties to the agreement are the U.S. Department of Justice
and New York state departments of environmental conservation,
law, health and the city of Niagara Falls.

   CARACAS -- Venezuelan non-oil exports have jumped 55%
since last year, the government said.
   The country exported more than $2.3 billion in non-oil
products from January through August 1990, up from $1.5
billion in the year-earlier period, the Central Office of
Statistics and Information said.

<TEXT>
   Venezuela exported $260 million in non-oil goods last
month, the highest level since March.
   The government has been trying to encourage the
non-traditional exports by allowing the local currency, the
bolivar, to devalue. The currency has gone from an average of
about 38 bolivares to the dollar in 1989 to a current 49
bolivares.
   Nearly 90% of Venezuela's export income comes from oil
sales.

   Senate Approves Fish Inspection Plan
   Giving Lead to Agriculture Department

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate adopted a mandatory fish
inspection plan that would put the nation's $30 billion
seafood industry under a triad of regulatory agencies.
   The landmark food-safety measure was approved by voice
vote after lawmakers voted, 59-39, to reject a rival
inspection plan favored by the Bush administration. The
measure, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
(D., Maine), would give the Agriculture Department the lead
in inspecting 1,900 processors nationwide. Currently, only a
fraction of four billion pounds of fish and shellfish
consumed each year in the U.S. undergoes some form of
product-grading or inspection.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "No longer will consumers have to guess whether or not the
fish they eat is safe," said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.),
floor manager of the bill. "For the first time, they will be
able to buy seafood with the USDA's seal of approval."
   Defeated was the proposal by Sens. Ernest Hollings (D.,
S.C.), Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Ted Stevens (R.,
Alaska) to give the inspection duties to the Food and Drug
Administration and the Commerce Department. In floor debate,
Sen. Mitchell successfully argued that the lack of a lead
agency "would muddle lines of authority and accountability,
making the {joint} program unworkable and incapable of
protecting public health."
   Under the Mitchell-Leahy bill, the Agriculture
Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would conduct
the seafood inspections, the FDA would set limits for
bacteria and other contaminants, while the Commerce
Department's National Marine Fisheries Service would continue
to oversee the nation's fisheries, including closing polluted
waters to fishing and shellfish harvesting.
   Awaiting floor action in the House are rival fish
inspection bills pushed by Agriculture Committee Chairman
Kika de la Garza (D., Texas) and by Commerce Committee
Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.). They are engaged in battle
over turf, just as their Senate counterparts, Messrs. Leahy
and Hollings, have been. Mr. de la Garza would give the lead
to the Agriculture Department, which falls under his panel's
jurisdiction, while Mr. Dingell favors the FDA, which his
committee oversees.
   Mr. Mitchell is expected to urge the House Democratic
leaders to expedite a vote on seafood-inspection legislation.
Backers of the Mitchell-Leahy bill have indicated a
willingness to accept a compromise measure. By giving the FDA
an expanded role, they hope to win over Mr. Dingell and avert
a presidential veto, which has been threatened by the White
House.
   For the consumer movement, however, last night's vote,
coming after more than 20 years of failed legislative
initiatives, was a mixed victory. The safe-food coalition
split over fish inspection, with Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy supporting the Mitchell-Leahy measure and most
other consumer groups favoring the Hollings-Kennedy-Stevens
bill.
   The bone of contention is whistle-blower protection. Under
the Mitchell-Leahy bill, there wouldn't be continuous
inspection of seafood processing plants. Instead, inspectors
would make random visits at the plants and rely on plant
workers for tips on improper or unsanitary pratices when the
inspectors aren't there.
   For this reason, most consumer groups supported the
Hollings-Kennedy-Stevens measure because it would have
protected whistle-blowers from reprisals by their employers.
Aides to Sen. Leahy said that whistle-blower protections will
be added to the Mitchell-Leahy bill when it goes to
conference.

   Worse Yet, Surgeons Might Start
   Doing Things With Pizza Cutters

   When piping-hot pizzas were wheeled in to the emergency
rooms of two public hospitals in Houston recently, nurses and
orderlies naturally wondered who the good Samaritan was.
   The answer was easy as pie to find: There, along with the
oozy cheese and gooey goodies, was the business card of Reid
McInvale, attorney at law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Why was Mr. McInvale, who handles his share of
personal-injury cases, donating pizzas to local hospital
workers?
   Simple, says Mr. McInvale. He had been reading the other
day about what a tough job hospital orderlies have. So, on
the spur of the moment, he decided to have a batch of pizzas
delivered to the two emergency rooms. He kept up the
deliveries several nights running, as a "minor token of
gratitude for some of the lowest paid, most overworked and
most dedicated workers in Houston."
   Harris County hospital officials were far from grateful,
however -- especially considering that Mr. McInvale sent
along his business card. ("You have to let the people know
it's not some serial killer sending the pizzas," he
explains.) The officials, suspecting that he was shopping for
leads to personal-injury cases -- Mr. McInvale denies he was
doing so -- asked county prosecutors to stop the deliveries.
   Dori Wind, an assistant county attorney, says she simply
asked Mr. McInvale "not to send any more pizzas." He
complied, but isn't happy about it.
   Mr. McInvale says he was told the pizza ban stemmed from a
hospital-district policy that bars hospital employees from
accepting gifts, and that any employees caught eating his
pizza would be fired or disciplined. Mr. McInvale calls this
policy hypocritical, considering how many freebies doctors
get from pharmaceutical companies. And he threatens to bring
a $100 million lawsuit against anyone who fires an orderly
for eating his pizzas.
   Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the State Bar of Texas,
says lawyers are barred by ethical rules from soliciting
lawsuits, but he doesn't know whether pizza deliveries would
be covered: "This is the first pizza solicitation call I've
had."
   For her part, Ms. Wind says that when she asked Mr.
McInvale to halt the pizza deliveries, she didn't indicate
that anyone would be fired.
   "I just told him it was inappropriate," says Ms. Wind.
"You really can't be eating pizzas in the emergency room --
it would be unsanitary."

   Five Latin Ministers Embrace Free Trade

<LP>
   Shortly before the Gulf crisis began dominating the
headlines, President Bush announced that he was interested in
establishing a free-trade zone covering the entire Western
Hemisphere: from northern Canada to the southern tip of South
America. His announcement followed on the heels of the first
stage of talks leading to a Mexican-U.S.-Canadian free-trade
agreement, which are moving much quicker than anyone imagined
when they were first announced. All this represents a
significant shift in Latin American thinking concerning
economic development.
   For decades, Latin American leaders were under the false
impression that the best way to develop their economies was
to protect local industry from foreign competition. This led
to statist capitalism, which benefited a few well-placed
industrialists but left the vast majority of citizens cut off
from the rest of the world. The industrialists got lazy
because they didn't have to compete with anyone -- including
their fellow countrymen -- and the products they manufactured
became inferior and over-priced. Uncompetitive islands of
economic and political instability resulted.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's a little early to say "all that has changed." But
Latin leaders are now generally accepting the notion that if
they integrate their economies with the rest of the world --
this hemisphere in particular -- they stand a much better
chance of growing and of benefiting from foreign ideas and
capital. Recently Wall Street Journal editors asked five
Latin American economic ministers their views on a
hemispheric trade zone. Their responses:
                                                                                                       

   COLOMBIA
                                                                                                       

   Rudolf Hommes
   Finance Minister:
   President Bush's idea of creating a Western Hemisphere
free-trade zone is of great importance. It is the first
concrete proposal of the U.S. to promote the integration of
the Americas based on trade, an important element of social
and political cohesion.
   However, in analyzing this initiative it is necessary to
point out that since it is not entirely based on economic
grounds -- but is associated with the geopolitical relations
of power -- it can introduce new economic inefficiencies. For
example, the economic integration with Latin American and
Caribbean countries could lead to a specialization of the
productive basis of those countries that is determined by the
competitive advantages that may exist with relation to the
U.S. and Canadian economies, but could not necessarily exist
with respect to the economies of the rest of the world.
   The idea, in principle, is feasible, provided that the
U.S. and its prospective Southern partners tame their
protectionist instincts in order to make it work. This would
seem plausible inasmuch as the international experience shows
that human well-being benefits from the effective practice of
free trade.
   In this sense, it is clear that Latin American leaders and
technocrats are finally aware that protectionism is out moded
and ruinous: The degree of protection given to local
production is a measure of the inefficiency that a community
is willing to tolerate in detriment to its own well-being,
and the economic development of the past 50 years in the
Latin American countries has been delayed by a social
ideology that has made them accept an outrageous level of
inefficiency for the sake of a vague but vehement
nationalism.
   As explained until now, the outline of the Bush initiative
seems to miss one element that would enhance these positive
expectations. While it would seek the free market of goods,
services, capital and technology within the free-trade area
in the medium term, it avoids referring to the conditions
that would permit what is essential for the success of an
integrated market: the free movement of people.
   Another important aspect of President Bush's proposal is
the flexibility given to each country to choose between
bilateral integration mechanisms and those that strengthen
sub-regional blocks. The same could be said with respect to
the freedom conferred to each country to choose their own
time frame for developing an agreement. However, free access
to the U.S. and Canadian markets is the common incentive that
would move Latin American countries in either direction. This
suggests that the bilateral option would be the most popular
choice.
   A key to the success of the integration process is the
equal treatment of and the non-discrimination among
participants, independent of the way in which they choose to
join. It may be that the implementation of the initiative
will not occur in the context of GATT-like negotiations but
that a series of general principles will be clearly defined
and will be compulsory for all participant members.
Nevertheless, it is hoped that the principles established by
the U.S. government will not be the same it is trying to
advance in the Uruguay Round because our expectation is that
this initiative would be more advantageous for Latin American
trade.
   Of course, this initiative will not comprehensively absorb
all bilateral issues. Colombia, for example, will be looking
beyond it or even beyond the Andean Initiative to advance its
own bilateral agenda with the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   MEXICO
                                                                                                       

   Jaime Serra-Puche
   Minister of Trade and Industry:
   President Bush's initiative concerning a hemispheric
free-trade zone has caught the imagination of Latin America.
The initiative will provide the means to complement
adequately economies in order to facilitate a new era of
trade and investment relations -- as well as enhancing
cooperation on scientific and technological issues. Free
trade is crucial in today's increasingly interdependent
world. The global economy requires active trade and
investment flows so domestic economies can prosper and grow.
Of course, trade agreements between developed and developing
nations need to recognize their differences so that every
participant benefits fully from liberalized trade regimes.
   Mexico's own structural change is based on a simple
premise: Mexico has to insert itself in the global economy.
Mexico's international competitiveness requires adequate
domestic policies and proper external market access, so the
country can benefit fully from international trade and
investment flows.
   On the one hand, domestic policies are consistent with the
outward orientation of the economy: Foreign investment has
been liberalized; non-tariff trade barriers have been
dismantled; intellectual-property-rights legislation is under
review to assure the necessary protection to patents,
licenses, trademarks and industrial secrets; and unnecessary
regulatory obstacles are being and will continue to be
removed. Overall, these policies have substantially enhanced
the competitiveness of Mexico's non-oil exports, which in the
course of the past seven years have increased by a factor of
four, surpassing the export performance of the most dynamic
countries during this period.
   On the other hand, trade negotiations to assure external
market access are a crucial complement to domestic policy.
With each region of the world, we are building stronger
economic relations, based on the principles of free trade.
With the U.S., in particular, we have initiated preparatory
talks that will lead to the negotiation of a free-trade
agreement.
   One important consequence of the free-trade agreement
between Mexico and the U.S. will be the increased
competitiveness of the region vis-a-vis the rest of the
world. In sum, a free-trade agreement will complement
Mexico's internationalization strategy and it will
substantially increase bilateral trade and investment flows.
The benefits of such a pact will undoubtedly accrue to both
countries, in terms of employment, efficiency and
international competitiveness.
                                                                                                       

   BRAZIL
                                                                                                       

   Zelia Cardosa de Mello
   Finance Minister:
   The Brazilian government has been carrying out a
tremendous effort to reform the structure of its economy. The
new foreign trade and industrial policies, which encompass
the gradual elimination of tariffs and trade barriers in
general, have facilitated a greater integration of the
Brazilian economy with the world economy.
   In this context, international cooperation is more than
welcomed. We feel that to the extent that this cooperation is
renewed and expanded, Brazil will be able to react to it more
swiftly and more effectively.
   The guidelines of the new U.S. free-trade initiative are a
positive sign to Latin America as whole. They represent a new
approach of the U.S. government toward the region. We hope to
be able to explore in more detail the proposals made and to
examine ways and means to apply them for mutual benefit. They
touch three points of fundamental importance: the debt
question, the new investments in the region and the building
up of an open trade market. By dealing with those three
essential matters they follow a path that we consider to be
potentially fruitful.
   The feasibility of the proposals depends, at this stage,
on the mechanisms of dialogue we may establish and, of
course, on the political will to carry them out.
   Brazil has discussed the initiative with the governments
of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and intends to follow up this
discussion. The idea of sharing our views with those of
neighbor countries had the implicit purpose of giving a
response re sulting from deep reflection and coordinated
views. We are sure that the elements are given for the new
steps we all intend to take in our relations with the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   CHILE
                                                                                                       

   Alejandro Foxley
   Minister of Finance:
   There is a growing awareness throughout Latin America that
having an open, trading economy is the surest path for
pulling our economies out of the poverty trap. But an export
drive can only succeed if it can secure export mar kets.
Unfortunately, many countries of the world -- including the
U.S. -- do not always reflect in their actions the free-trade
gospel they preach. There is also the danger of having
"trading blocks" develop, most notably in Europe and the
Pacific. Latin America is not beyond reproach either, having
allowed its regional trading arrangements to languish in the
past 20 years. I welcome President Bush's proposal as a
much-needed antidote to this dangerous world-wide tendency.
It is now up to all countries in the hemisphere to move
swiftly and begin taking concrete steps.
   A free-trade agreement in the Americas would ultimately
benefit every country in the hemisphere, rich or poor. For
Latin America, greater openness would mean greater foreign
competition. But it would also provide much-needed overseas
customers. I believe many of us are ready to take up this
challenge. At the same time, growing Latin American exports
to the U.S. and Canada would have as a counterpart a more
stable and prosperous set of economies south of the Rio
Grande, among which Northern firms could also find promising
trade and investment partners. There would be some temporary
adjustment costs, but the long-run mutual benefits are clear.
The proposal therefore seems feasible. What is now needed is
the political will to move forward.
   At this point it seems practical to proceed in stages.
Those countries that are ready to open up their markets
should start negotiations, whether bilaterally or in larger
groups. Any concession made to the participants in the early
stages could also be extended to other countries that may
decide to join the process at a later date. Chile already has
low and uniform tariffs and no non-tariff barriers
whatsoever. We believe that is a helpful starting point for
discussions with the U.S. or any other countries of the
region.
                                                                                                       

   ARGENTINA
                                                                                                       

   Antonio Erman Gonzalez
   Minister of Economy:
   We are enthusiastic about President Bush's proposal. We
believe that economic integration is the most important
challenge that the American nations have in this decade, and
the most effective method to compete in the world economy.
Argentina wants to move forward toward this goal by pursuing
the following steps:
   1) Achieve an agreement with the U.S. that will homogenize
the regulatory framework in both countries, allowing free
movement of capital; and
   2) Establish a free-trade zone with Brazil and other
countries in the southern cone by 1994 so as to become a more
meaningful trading partner to integrate with North America.

   Excise Tax on Stocks
   Poses Economic Threat

<LP>
   In your Aug. 16 Asides "Markets Defended" you described my
opposition to the proposed stock transaction excise tax
(STET). This matter is no aside to those of us who are
concerned about the economic vitality of our cities and
states -- and that of our country. Research conducted by my
office calculated in real terms the multiple blows that STET
will deliver.
   Based on a Congressional Research Service estimate that a
0.5% STET will prompt a 9.3% drop in stock values, the report
by my office notes this could mean the loss of $325 billion
in the value of American equities. This drop will most
certainly have a negative effect on consumer spending and
pose the threat of recession.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jobs will also fall victim to STET. An 8% drop in trading
volume will result in a loss of more than 30,000 jobs
nationally in the "FIRE" sector-finance, insurance and real
estate. In New York City we project a loss of 10,000 jobs in
the FIRE sector and 18,000 in non-FIRE private employment.
The aggregate annual income loss in New York alone would be
$1 billion.
   Equally as serious will be the effect on major pension
funds. For example, the pension funds of New York City,
currently valued at $38 billion, will lose $51 million in
direct payments of STET. The expected decline in stock-market
values will hit the pension funds with an additional $1.2
billion to $1.9 billion nationwide; STET will force private
and public pension-fund sponsors to increase their
contributions or decrease benefits to retirees.
   Since state and local government bonds and notes are not
exempt from STET, although federal government securities are,
underwriters estimate that STET will cost New York City $75
million to $125 million a year in additional interest charges
for bond financing and $25 million a year for note sales.
(Similar costs and consequences will be encountered by other
states and localities that issue bonds or notes.) Capital
expenditures for bridges, highways, schools and prison
facilities will be jeopardized. At the same time, New York
City will find its tax base suffering from the job losses and
a consequent reduction in personal-income-tax receipts that
will cost the city $20 million.
   STET proponent Lawrence Summers of Harvard, who believes a
decrease in volume will cut down on volatility, cheers the
idea that the excise tax will "throw sand in the gears" of a
market that works too well. The risk of sending investors to
markets overseas or of forcing the economy into a downgrade
tailspin cannot be left to academic speculation or
Bush-administration hijinks. STET is really another covert
action that attempts to shift the burden of the federal
deficit to already-distressed state and local governments. If
adopted, STET will throw more than sand in their gears; it
will rub salt into already-wounded municipal local and state
economies.

   Founding shareholders of the troubled Italian chemical

public-private partnership, Italy's state industry ministry
said.
   Enimont's founders also laid out steps to transfer
ownership of the company, possibly within 30 days, to one of
the two partners, the state energy agency Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi and Montedison S.p.A., a chemical company.

   "The parties agree that ENI will communicate its offer to
acquire or sell {its Enimont stake} within 15 days . . . and
Montedison will convey its answer within 15 days of the
offer," the ministry statement said. Under guidelines set out
by the government last week, if Montedison refuses to buy the
agency's stake, the government will acquire Montedison's
holding. Each partner owns 40% of Enimont, and minority
shareholders own the remaining 20%.
   Profound differences between the two main shareholders
have marred Enimont from its inception, keeping the company
from becoming the model of state-private cooperation it set
out to be.

   Real Estate:
   New York's Realty Woes Hit Zeckendorf,
   Who May Sell Stake in Firm to Japanese

   In New York City's tottering real estate market,
apparently no one is immune.
   Even William Zeckendorf Jr., among the city's busiest and
most cautious developers of the 1980s, is now being whipsawed
by tight credit and declining real estate values.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Mr. Zeckendorf's empire has appeared solid even
as those of other big developers have faltered, Mr.
Zeckendorf is being forced to restructure loans on two of his
biggest projects.
   In a move that people close to the developer say would
reinvigorate his empire, Mr. Zeckendorf is negotiating to
sell a major portion of his company to Tobishima Corp., a
Tokyo-based construction company, in exchange for a cash
infusion. But that deal appears far from completed, say
people familiar with the negotiations.
   "I have seen the ups and downs in these markets, and in
order to make a stronger company, we should have stronger
partnership links," said the 60-year-old Mr. Zeckendorf in a
telephone interview from Japan. "We're going into an era
where overleveraging is not the thing to do."
   In purchasing equity in Mr. Zeckendorf's company, a
Japanese company would be primarily acquiring both his
development expertise and the cachet of the Zeckendorf name.
Such a transaction would be in line with a Japanese pattern
of low-profile investments in U.S. real estate, despite the
recent purchases of such trophies as Pebble Beach and a
controlling interest in Rockefeller Center.
   Yukio Furuya, a spokesman for Tobishima, said that the
company hasn't decided if it would accept Zeckendorf's
proposal but that its response would be made before the end
of the month.
   Mr. Furuya stressed that the transaction wouldn't be a
takeover but would be set up as an equally owned U.S. joint
venture to earn fees for real estate development planning and
marketing. He declined to discuss the possible capitalization
of the venture.
   Tobishima has been involved in a $150 million
community-development project in Mahattan in a partnership
with Zeckendorf since last fall. The Japanese company started
its U.S. operation in 1985 through the establishment of a
unit, Los Angeles-based Tobishima U.S.A. Inc., and now
operates 13 units and affiliates in the U.S. involved in
construction and real estate development. Annual sales in the
U.S. last year totaled $25 million.
   Mr. Zeckendorf's challenge is particularly poignant
because, a quarter century ago, he watched helplessly as the
real estate empire of his father, William Zeckendorf Sr.,
fell into bankruptcy. "The ghost of Bill Zeckendorf Sr. seems
to be in the closet of one of his offices," says one
associate.
   The junior Mr. Zeckendorf has been meeting with his
lenders, which include Bank of Montreal and Equitable Life
Assurance Society of the United States, for at least the past
three months to restructure loans on projects that aren't
making enough to cover their interest payments. Because Mr.
Zeckendorf offered minimal personal guarantees on the
projects, his liabilities aren't believed to exceed $5
million. He said arrangements have already been made with his
lenders that will allow him to retain his equity interests.
   Mr. Zeckendorf is far from the only developer who is under
the gun. In Atlanta, John Portman is in emergency meetings
with his creditors on $2 billion in loans. In New York City,
a slew of developers are reportedly in workouts with their
bankers.
   People close to Mr. Zeckendorf's creditors say, in fact,
that his lenders have no desire to force his hand, and will
likely give him time to work out his problems. "Banks will do
things for him that they might not do for others," said one
banker who has worked with Mr. Zeckendorf. "People look at
him with more fondness than others."
   Mr. Zeckendorf's style of operation contrasts sharply to
that of another New York real estate mogul. Unlike Donald
Trump, who recently completed a $65 million bailout with his
bankers, Mr. Zeckendorf was extremely conservative, even in
the go-go '80s. Mr. Zeckendorf worked with partners to
minimize his own risk; he avoided making ego-driven purchases
of trophy properties; and he kept a relatively low profile in
the town where builders could become celebrities on the
strength of one project.
   Employing this low-key approach, he put together over two
dozen projects during the decade. He built condominiums on
Central Park and office buildings in once-seedy areas such as
Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen and Union Square.
   He built upscale hotels and midpriced apartment houses,
and an office condominium in the middle of midtown. In the
only project that bore his name, Zeckendorf Towers, located
on Union Square, he made clear that the project was named
after his late father, not himself.
   In an odd twist that could have landed him in more trouble
than he is already in, he once represented an investment
group that offered Mr. Trump $550 million for a vacant West
Side rail site that real estate experts say has far less
value today. Luckily for Mr. Zeckendorf, the deal didn't go
through.
   Mr. Zeckendorf's current problems appear to result partly
from bad luck and bad timing. In two projects converted from
old Gimbel's department stores, construction overruns
approached a total of $100 million. However, Mr. Zeckendorf
wasn't the partner in charge of the project; New York City
developer Larry Silverstein had that responsibility.
   Even though Mr. Zeckendorf sold nearly all of his equity
interest in the projects early on, he guaranteed to the banks
that projects would be completed within budget, say people
familiar with the situation. Mr. Zeckendorf's potential
exposure for the overruns is about $5 million, according to
an individual familiar with the deals.
   Mr. Silverstein declined to comment, as did Bank of
Montreal and Equitable Life Assurance.
   To make matters worse, Mr. Zeckendorf, like other New York
developers, is feeling the sharp effects of tough economic
times. Over 300,000 square feet of office space once occupied
by Integrated Resources Inc. at Zeckendorf Towers in Union
Square now sit vacant as a result of that company's collapse.
A Times Square hotel and office complex Mr. Zeckendorf built
also has over 200,000 square feet of vacant office space.
   In addition, Mr. Zeckendorf has at least five condominium
projects yet to be fully sold, in a market that brokers say
gets worse with each passing day.
   One reason that Mr. Zeckendorf appears to be having
trouble weathering the slowdown is that he never realized
enormous profits even from his most successful projects in
the 1980s.
   In order to limit his risk and allow himself to undertake
as many projects as possible, he preferred to sell his
ownership interest in the early stages, sometimes even before
the project broke ground. Among real estate cognoscenti, he
was known as a "fee" developer -- someone who took short-term
fees in return for stitching deals together.
   "I think he's made a lot of people richer than he's made
himself," says Jack Shaffer, a mortgage broker with
Sonnenblick-Goldman Corp., which helped Mr. Zeckendorf raise
$1 billion to help finance some of his early projects.
   In an industry filled with flamboyant entrepreneurs, the
60-year-old Mr. Zeckendorf cuts an oddly unflashy figure. In
meetings, he often can be seen chewing on the end of his
reading glasses; sometimes, he speaks so softly that he can't
be heard. Colleagues describe him as coming from the
old-school of real estate, where deals were cemented with a
handshake.
   He lives on Park Avenue in Manhattan with his wife, a
retired ballerina, and has generally avoided the champagne
society, preferring to spend time horseback riding in his
upstate New York country home or at his Santa Fe, N.M., home.
   Mr. Zeckendorf's quiet demeanor stands in stark contrast
to his larger-than-life father, with whom he apprenticed
starting at age 14.
   No man was more responsible for reshaping the downtowns of
modern cities than was the senior Mr. Zeckendorf. He built or
planned Mile High Center in Denver, Century City in Los
Angeles, and Place Ville-Marie in Montreal. He built giant
malls in Long Island and industrial parks across Canada, and
drilled for oil off the coast of Surinam. His most enduring
achievement was probably the assemblage of the land where the
United Nations now sits.
   But while he wasn't afraid to build, he was equally
fearless when it came to borrowing money, saying, "I'd rather
be alive at 18% than dead at 12%." Ultimately, the senior
Zeckendorf suffered from the same overconfidence that has
afflicted other fallen developers. His empire collapsed in
1965 when Marine Midland Bank called in an $8.5 million note.

   Hyundai Campaign Seeks to Lure

   Hyundai Motor, the South Korean auto maker dogged by
flagging U.S. car sales, is doing some major body work on its
low-price image.
   This month, Hyundai will wheel out a new ad campaign
designed to convince car buyers that it knows how to make
stylish cars that hip people like to be seen in. The campaign
will spotlight its new Scoupe sporty coupe, which Hyundai
hopes will become popular among folks in their 20s and 30s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We've begun to reposition the Hyundai brand name and our
individual models as the best combination anywhere of value,
performance, quality and dependability," says Rod Hayden,
executive vice president and chief operating officer of
Hyundai Motor America.
   But Hyundai faces an enormous challenge. The company is
plagued by a reputation for offering no-frills cars that
aren't quite as good as their Japanese and U.S. competitors.
And its once bargain-priced cars aren't as cheap as they used
to be, thanks to higher wages in South Korea and the won's
strength against the dollar.
   Indeed, its new ad campaign, created by Backer Spielvogel
Bates's Irvine, Calif., office, plays down the
cost-consciousness that was the focus of its most recent
"Cars That Make Sense" campaign. Hyundai has swapped its
price pitch for ads that have the glitzy feel of some
luxury-car ads.
   One ad for the Scoupe shows the car cruising at high
speeds through smoky city streets late at night. "This car
will do wonders for your image . . . and ours," the announcer
says. The Scoupe then whizzes past a small group of
club-going types dressed in black who turn around just in
time to get a view of the car as it speeds away. "The new
Scoupe from Hyundai. Yes, Hyundai," is the kicker.
   Another ad shows the Scoupe speeding along a freeway --
but the entire scene is shown upside down. Near the end of
the spot, the camera turns right side up and the announcer
says, "You'll find this sporty new coupe so much fun, you may
never look at Hyundai quite the same way again."
   The "Hyundai. Yes, Hyundai," theme line appears at the end
of all the new spots. "It's an answer to the various
surprises that we expect people" to have, says Harry Grusche,
senior vice president of Backer Spielvogel, a unit of Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi.
   Hyundai badly needs the marketing make over. Through the
first eight months of the year, Hyundai sales declined more
than 29% to just 93,421 cars from 132,440 cars in the
year-earlier period. Part of Hyundai's problem has been
softness in the market for subcompact cars, where sales have
fallen 18% so far this year.
   Marketing experts are skeptical that Hyundai will be able
to woo a much hipper crowd simply by running slick ads.
"You've got to wonder, just how up-market can you push this?"
asks Richard Winger, a partner at Boston Consulting Group in
New York. Mr. Winger notes that raising the image of any
no-frills product is a difficult proposition.
   But Hyundai insists consumers who may not have considered
its cars before will give them a chance when they see the new
ads on such TV shows as "Twin Peaks" and "Saturday Night
Live." The car maker says, further, that the cars consumers
see will impress them: Hyundai recently made a number of
changes on its Excel and Sonata models.
   Hyundai said it has planned a stepped-up fourth-quarter ad
budget to aggressively promote the launch of the new ads. In
1989, Hyundai spent $87 million on ads for its passenger
cars, according to Leading National Advertisers, a firm that
tracks ad spending.
   "We still do make cars that make sense," says Maurice
Bowen, Hyundai's national manager of advertising. "But we
want to tell consumers that they owe it to themselves to give
Hyundai a second look."

   Saatchi Is Keeping Siegel
                                                                                                       

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has decided to keep its Siegel &amp; Gale
design group, a small unit that was widely expected to be
bought back by management. The battered British advertising
giant has been trying to raise cash by seeking to sell a
number of its non-core ad businesses in the U.S.
   The Siegel negotiations apparently stalled over purchase
price. Robert Louis-Dreyfus, Saatchi's chief executive
officer, "approached us and said he would entertain an offer"
for a management buy-out, said Alan Siegel, the firm's
chairman and chief executive. But Mr. Louis-Dreyfus decided
"the price that we could afford to pay for it wasn't worth
it," Mr. Siegel said. "He wasn't going to sell a company at a
discount."
   Mr. Siegel said the two months of talks had ended because
Saatchi recognizes Siegel's "future growth and profit
prospects." Saatchi has promised continued financial support
so the two concerns can "build on their existing business
relationship," the statement added.

   PILLSBURY ACCOUNT: Pillsbury, a unit of Grand Metropolitan
PLC, is talking to several agencies about the ad assignment
for a breakfast toaster pastry product, industry executives
said. Leo Burnett, one of Pillsbury's largest agencies, isn't
in the running, because the product resembles Pop-Tarts, made
by Kellogg, another large Burnett client. Billings are
estimated at $5 million to $10 million.
                                                                                                       

   NETWORK PROMOTION: McDonald's and NBC announced details of
their joint "McMillions" sweepstakes promotion for the fall
TV season. Game cards for the $35.5 million contest will be
handed out at McDonald's stores. Winning card numbers will be
announced on prime-time shows on NBC, a General Electric

   RCA CAMPAIGN: Nipper, the RCA mascot dog that listens for
"his master's voice," is being revived in a series of new TV
spots for the RCA brand of Thomson SA's Thomson Consumer
Electronics'. The ads, which promote RCA's "Home Theatre"
line of large-screen TVs and other RCA lines, feature a
real-life Nipper barking alongside a look-alike puppy in a
bid to secure the loyalty of consumers under 40. Ammirati &amp;
Puris, New York, created the ads.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNTS: Sears, Roebuck named Mullen, Wenham, Mass.,
to handle the national launch of Sears Vacation Travel, which
will market vacation packages. Billings weren't disclosed. .

   Chase Floyd's Shop Is No Clip Joint
   When It Comes to Cuts for Homeless

   CHASE FLOYD IS A TRULY HANDS-ON VOLUNTEER who knows that
philanthropy isn't limited to the well-to-do. Working from
his Chase Hair Salon in Chapel Hill, N.C., the 30-year-old
hair stylist spends an hour or two every week giving free
haircuts to homeless people who otherwise couldn't afford his
$14 to $20 fees. The benefit is more than a coiffure or a
trim, it's renewed self-respect for the recipient.
   "The homeless get the same treatment as my regular
clients," says Mr. Floyd. He began the free haircuts over two
years ago after one of his regular customers told him about
the volunteer work under way at a Chapel Hill shelter run by
the Inter-Faith Council for Social Service. Mr. Floyd, a
Virginian who moved to North Carolina three years ago, wanted
to volunteer, too, but decided his 9 a.m.-to-9 p.m.
small-business hours didn't give him much free time; besides,
he explains, hair styling was the "only thing I really knew
how to do well."
   So he asked Christopher Moran, community services manager
of Inter-Faith, if he could cut shelter guests' hair. Mr.
Moran agreed to the unusual offer, figuring the stylist
"really wanted to do something to contribute" to helping
people without homes get a new start. What began as one free
haircut a week has become three. What's more, Mr. Moran
believes, Mr. Floyd's example of selfless service has spurred
others in the community, including a lawyer and a group of
doctors and nurses, to offer their professional skills.
   As his scissors clip and electric razor hums, Mr. Floyd
converses easily and casually with his homeless clients,
asking about their health and offering suggestions on where
to find jobs and housing. There's nothing patronizing about
these exchanges: "You got it too close back there," one woman
from the shelter says after looking over Mr. Floyd's work in
the mirror. "You said to make it as close as I could in the
back and I did," he responds. "You look nice." Another look,
a smile of agreement, and the woman thanks Mr. Floyd and
leaves.
   One disheveled drifter, dispirited because he couldn't
land so much as a dishwasher's job, early this year was sent
by the shelter to the salon for a haircut. When Mr. Floyd
finished his work, the homeless man could have passed for a
student at the nearby University of North Carolina. Within
two months, the man had a waiter's job and his own small
apartment in a low-cost housing unit.
   Some of the shelter guests want to repay Mr. Floyd and
have at times performed such jobs as raking the salon yard.
Mr. Floyd also pays them for occasional work, such as
painting. Others in the hair business warned Mr. Floyd that
helping the homeless this way might alienate paying
customers, but just the opposite seems to have happened.
"I've had some people come here because they've heard what
I'm doing," he reports.
   Mr. Floyd also makes other contributions to the shelter.
This past Christmas, he threw a party at the salon attended
by 40 homeless people and 15 volunteers. Mr. Floyd personally
donated about $200 of the $1,000 worth of chicken wings,
cookies and soft drinks to the party; local merchants
contributed the balance. He's helping to host another party
for shelter residents this December. He also plans to keep up
the free haircuts. "I will continue to do this as long as I
have a business," Mr. Floyd says.

   Ex-Southmark Chairman's
   $960,000 Bonus Is Blocked

   DALLAS -- A federal bankruptcy judge here refused to allow
Southmark Corp. to pay a $960,000 bonus to Arthur G. Weiss,
who marshalled the real estate and financial services company
through its recent reorganization.
   The bonus would have supplemented the $480,000 annual
salary and $480,000 in severance benefits to be received by
Mr. Weiss, who stepped down as Southmark's chairman in
mid-August as part of the court-approved reorganization plan
for Southmark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stephen Felsenthal said yesterday
that he couldn't "in good conscience" approve the bonus
payment to Mr. Weiss. "The court is very skeptical about
compensation packages from companies that are able to pay
only a fraction of their debts," the judge said. Southmark's
reorganization plan provides for creditors to receive just
$300 million in cash and securities to satisfy claims
totaling $2 billion.
   Southmark directors approved Mr. Weiss's bonus in January,
about a year after he had taken the helm following the
directors' ouster of Gene E. Phillips as chairman and William
S. Friedman as vice chairman. Southmark filed in July 1989
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.
   Mr. Weiss, reached at his home in Atlanta, said he was
disappointed by the judge's decision but could understand the
reasoning behind it. "I've been compensated fairly in this,"
he said, adding that any appeal would be carefully
considered. "I think I did go out with honor, and to have a
fight now wouldn't do anybody any good," he said.
   Separately, Judge Felsenthal ruled that Southmark has
fulfilled the requirements of its reorganization plan
relating to stock and cash payments to creditors and the
transfer of $100 million in assets to the company's thrift
unit, San Jacinto Savings Association of Houston. The judge's
order effectively seals the plan from any further changes,
though parts of it have been appealed by Messrs. Phillips and
Friedman.

   Press vs. Army: Front Action in an Old Battle

   One autumn day in 1864, William Tecumseh Sherman, the
smoldering ruins of Georgia barely behind him, learned that
three reporters traveling with his Army of the Tennessee had
been captured by the rebels. The general also heard --
falsely -- that they had been executed.
   "Good," he snapped. "Now we'll have news from hell before
breakfast]"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While Sherman's view of the press may seem a little harsh
in these days of affable public affairs officers and talky
generals on the evening news, an ingrained and unshakable
distrust of journalists has a long military history. It is
something to consider in these days of huffing and puffing
about "getting at the facts" of our posture in the Persian
Gulf.
   During the Crimean War, Sir William Howard Russell, the
"father of war correspondents," brought down Lord Aberdeen's
government with dispatches about the command's treatment of
its own troops. So loathed was Russell by the generals that
he had to pitch a tent outside camp and almost starved during
the Russian winter. In the Civil War, Russell dined with
Lincoln, but was virtually run out of the country after his
all-too-accurate reports of the Union army's collapse at Bull
Run.
   The European high commands kept such close watch on
newsmen in World War I that America's celebrity
correspondent, Richard Harding Davis, packed up and went
home, but not until after he had been arrested as a spy by
the Germans. In Korea, correspondents, initially urged to
censor themselves within the bounds of an ill-defined
security and regard for morale, begged for official controls
as competition led them into dangerous indiscretions.
   In the discordant '60s, Americans in their living rooms
saw their sons wounded and dying. For the first time -- and
probably the last -- battlefield access was not restricted,
nor dispatches censored. News of the most highly dramatized
failure in our history poured out of the hundreds of
helicopters and jeeps available to reporters.
   The front ranks of American journalism are thick with
those who got their first break covering Vietnam, righteously
deciding that victory wasn't worth dying for -- and, anyway,
the fall of Goliath was a far better story. During the Tet
Offensive of 1968, for example, the televised pictures of
Viet Cong on the embassy lawn never caught up with the
reality -- that the enemy was severely punished and
dispersed, a fact even Hanoi's commanders would admit years
later.
   Even without the press's "help," from 1974 to 1983 our
armed forces seemed punch drunk, bumping dazedly into one
another; a C-5A evacuating orphans from Saigon crashed and
burned; a botched attempt to rescue crewmen of the freighter
Mayaguez from an island in the Gulf of Siam ended in a
senseless accident -- and then, most desperate of all, came
bungling and disaster at Desert One.
   Nothing suggests that information will flow from the
Middle East as once did Kuwaiti crude. Indeed, the hapless
Pentagon media pool, now disbanded for Saudi Arabia,
represented an effort to dispel suspicion that the brass
still remembered the enthusiasm with which Vietnam's debacles
had been aired. Never again would they let the press "lose" a
war.
   Despite the earnest disclaimers of Defense Department spin
artists and "enlightened" field commanders, the breach
remains unrepaired. Military men cannot forget those
humiliations and, despite revisionist assertions that the
reporting from Southeast Asia had negligible effect on public
opinion, they still taste the gall. They provided access --
and got a bonus set of battle scars for their trouble. Such
memories have become a legacy. Ask any cadet at West Point,
any raw recruit what he thinks of newspeople. What's more,
they no doubt reflect the attitude of their commander in
chief, George Bush.
   "He who says he had made war without mistakes," observed
Napoleon, "has made but little war," a maxim that military
professionals grasp all too well, and one that politicians
fear to entertain. There are demonstrably authentic grounds
for secrecy -- the risks to our side -- but they also mask
the "fog of war," that catalog of blunders that is war's
companion -- and so often the red meat of news.
   Media executives insist they understand why "sensitive
strategies" must not be revealed, yet they demand the "facts"
-- names, numbers, places and plans -- all of which collides
with that admirable summary of the military attitude offered
by a British intelligence chief during World War I: "Say what
you like, old man. But don't mention any places or people."
   More often than not, commanders regard reporters as
interlopers with no understanding of military imperatives:
discipline, organization, technology, "the life." Eliminating
the draft has only widened the gap, producing a press corps
often hard put to tell a sergeant from a captain, let alone
grasp the mysteries of thermal optical sights. The military
public-affairs apparatus has not forgotten the days when it
could be dangerous to wear the uniform in public. It is ready
to deal with the media's ever-increasing ability to broadcast
live from the hot spots, painfully aware that pictures of a
pilot lying in a burns unit or an infantryman slumped over a
machine gun -- the body bag factor -- may erode American
will, strengthen the enemy's hand. Perhaps all they can count
on is that Saddam Hussein, to say the least, lacks the
ascetic charisma of a Ho Chi Minh.
   As U.S. forces poise at the line drawn in the sand, the
military and media have once more squared off on their own
patch of ground. While dashing F-15s gleam on runways,
reporters rhapsodize about "the cutting edge" of American
might, but from a designated distance. While the knights ride
out against each other on this vast tournament ground,
editors back home fume about military control. Memories die
hard and the lessons of Vietnam are bearing bitter fruit in
the desert.

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Valley Capital Corp.'s Valley Bank unit
said it would continue charging a $1 surcharge on 100 of its
automated teller machines around the state after a federal
appellate court ruled againt a challenge by Plus System.
   The surcharge, levied to ATM customers mostly at machines
in casinos, is unique to Nevada, which passed a law last year
making it unlawful for bank card networks to dictate whether
banks could use the surcharge. Denver-based Plus System Inc.
challenged the constitutionality of that law, which a federal
appeals court upheld.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Valley Bank had sued Plus System on antitrust grounds
because Plus System refused to cooperate on the surcharge for
its customers. Valley Bank's gross revenue on the surcharge
is about $200,000 a month, according to Jon Joseph, executive
vice president and general counsel. A Valley spokesman said
he expected more Nevada banks to follow suit.
   Plus System attorneys couldn't be reached, and it wasn't
known if they would appeal. The bank-card network is owned by
a group of banks and Visa International Inc.

   Technology:
   Motorola, Toshiba
   Are Said to Reach
   Joint Venture Pact

   TOKYO -- Motorola Inc. and Toshiba Corp. agreed in
principle to set up a semiconductor joint venture in
Scotland, people close to the companies said.
   Details are still under negotiation, and a signing date
hasn't been set, those people stressed. The plans are the
most significant part of a basic agreement, reached a few
months ago, to expand the three-year-old relationship between
the concerns. Motorola and Toshiba make memory and logic
chips in a joint venture in northern Japan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The project would give Toshiba its first major chip-making
operation in Europe.
   Neither company would confirm the accord, which was
reported in Thursday's Nihon Keizai Shimbun. A Motorola
spokesman in the U.S. said the company has an "agreement in
principle" on a "new phase" of its agreement with Toshiba,
but wouldn't elaborate.
   A spokesman at Toshiba's headquarters in Tokyo said that
the company hopes to build a new semiconductor plant in
Europe and that a venture with Motorola is "one of the
possibilities." He said the company also is considering
partnerships with Siemens AG of West Germany and Thomson S.A.
of France, or may open a plant by itself.
   Toshiba currently assembles semiconductors in West
Germany, but the Motorola plant would be its first European
wafer fabrication facility. Wafer fabrication, which involves
making the heart of the semiconductor, is more complicated
and has higher value than assembly. As the European Community
governments move toward economic integration and established
domestic-content regulations for 1992, wafer fabrication is
considered an important mark of "local" production.
   Motorola currently has its own wafer fabrication facility
in Scotland.
   The tentative Motorola-Toshiba agreement comes amid
speculation that the relationship between the companies has
been on the rocks. Earlier this year, Motorola signed an
agreement giving it access to memory chip technology from
International Business Machines Corp. Motorola is supposed to
get that same technology from Toshiba, but apparently
couldn't reach an agreement on getting more advanced
know-how. Motorola is teaching Toshiba how to make logic
chips.
   As another part of the same basic pact that includes the
European venture, Toshiba and Motorola decided to build more
advanced-generation semciondcutors in Japan. They didn't
agree on a more wide-ranging technology sharing, the people
close to the companies said.
   The venture between the companies would be the latest in a
string of bilateral semiconductor agreements signed this
year. As trade tensions mount, particularly over
semiconductors, Japanese government and industry officials
are encouraging more joint ventures to bring the industries
closer together.

   PHILADELPHIA -- The cash-strapped city of Philadelphia
said it will again postpone the sale of $375 million in
short-term bonds after Swiss Bank Corp. withdrew its
guarantee for a portion of the offering.
   At a news conference, Mayor W. Wilson Goode said the
bank's withdrawal and "excessively high" interest rates
demanded by investors in yesterday's pricing attempt were
factors forcing the city to postpone pricing the notes for at
least another week. Philadelphia originally intended to sell
the notes last month.

   In a move to reassure holders of the city's other bonds,
rated "below investment grade" by Moody's Investor's Service
Inc., Mayor Goode said he was directing the city finance
director to transfer sufficient cash to the sinking fund and
other escrow accounts to meet the city's debt obligations
through June 30.
   Swiss Bank confirmed Tuesday that it was guaranteeing $50
million of the notes, the only bank to make such a
commitment. But yesterday the bank said it would no longer
participate in the offering because unspecified conditions
for its support had not been fulfilled.
   "We have determined that these conditions have not been
satisfied, and, accordingly, we have decided not to proceed,"
said a spokesman at the bank's headquarters in Basel,
Switzerland. Mayor Goode said he was still trying to learn
why the bank backed out.
   Swiss Bank's desertion is likely to make the notes more
difficult to sell and could force the city to restructure the
offering or scuttle it, said traders and analysts.
   At best, Philadelphia will have to offer a significant
premium for the tax-free notes. Peter Allegrini, a bond-fund
manager for Fidelity Investments, said yesterday's pricing
suggested a yield of about 9.5%, compared with about 6% for
the typical short-term municipal note.
   Philadelphia needs the proceeds from the note sale to
stave off a cash-flow crisis arising from a $206.4 million
budget deficit in the year ending June 30. Without the notes,
officials say the city can stretch its funds until December
at best. And even with a note sale, the city will run out of
cash in May.
   The city's precarious financial position has some
investors convinced that the notes, which are unsecured, are
too risky at any yield. "There is just not enough security in
this thing to fall back on if the city were to get into
trouble," said Robert Froehlich, an analyst at Van Kempen
Merritt Investment Advisory Corp. "Whether it's 9 1/2% or 11
1/2% or 12 1/2%, if the city goes into bankruptcy, that extra
risk isn't worth it."
   Mr. Froehlich said that Van Kempen holds about about $30
million of Philadelphia's other bonds but does not intend to
buy any notes unless the offering is restructured to
guarantee payment. "Banks are in the business of lending," he
said. "The fact that one of them got on board and then got
off certainly was a red light."
   But Fidelity's Mr. Allegrini said the notes are very
appealing at the high yields Philadelphia's underwriters were
offering. "I haven't finished my homework, but I'm very close
to saying yes," he said.
   Mr. Allegrini said the city plans to put revenue in a
special account to pay off the notes. "We want to make sure
that once the funds are in the lockbox, they are there to pay
off the notes," he said. If the city can clarify the
covenants, Fidelity will probably buy the notes for its
Pennsylvania tax-free bond fund.
   Philadelphia's fiscal troubles have also affected its
other debt. This summer, Moody's downgraded the city's credit
rating to the junk-bond level. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. gives
the city its lowest investment-grade rating.
   And since city controller Jonathan A. Saidel disclosed the
city's cash woes in mid-August, leery investors have bid up
the yields on the city's bonds. Yields on the city's 8 1/4
general obligation bonds due 2009, for example, have risen
from about 8% to about 8.6%, said Alan Schankel, manager of
the municipal bond department at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
in Philadelphia.
   "The city leadership must show a game plan," Mr. Schankel
said. "They aren't showing that things are going to change."
   Mayor Goode was optimistic that the city's elected
officials can resolve the fiscal crisis. "I believe it is our
responsibility to come to a consensus," he said. "The problem
we have is solvable."

   SIX NATIONS SIGNED a treaty restoring full sovereignty to
a united Germany.
   The treaty, signed in Moscow by the two Germanys and the
four World War II victors, endorses the unified Germany
scheduled to come into being Oct. 3. The new Germany can
remain in NATO, but no non-German NATO forces will be
permanently stationed on the territory of the former East
German state. In return, the treaty declares that the united
Germany "has no territorial claims whatsoever against other
states." As part of a side accord, Bonn agreed to provide
billions of dollars in aid to Moscow and help build housing
in the U.S.S.R. for the nearly 400,000 Soviet troops that
will leave German territory.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the treaty, Germany will reduce its armed forces to
370,000 troops, and pledges not to acquire nuclear, chemical
or biological weapons. Germany also will sign a treaty with
Poland guaranteeing their current border.

   IRAN CALLED FOR a holy war against American forces in the
Persian Gulf.
   The speech by Iranian spiritual leader Khamenei came amid
reports Tehran had agreed to help break a U.N. embargo by
giving Baghdad food and medicine in return for Iraqi oil. In
Washington, Bush prepared a videotaped message to Iraq's
citizens in which he said they should blame their own
government for the hardships that have resulted from the
trade embargo.
   The State Department urged U.S. women and children in
Kuwait to contact the embassy immediately to arrange their

   The House voted to require heftier military spending by
U.S. allies in Europe and the Pacific as part of post-Cold
War defense arrangements. The provisions, approved during
debate on a $283 billion defense authorization bill for
fiscal 1991, include a requirement that Tokyo pay the full
cost of U.S. forces in Japan.
   Gorbachev said a plan for converting the Soviet Union to a

   ST. SAUVEUR, Quebec -- If Jacques Hebert's idea catches
on, marketers will have a new way to reach the kind of people
who read corporate annual reports -- ads in corporate annual
reports.
   Mont Saint-Sauveur International Inc.'s 32-page report for
fiscal 1990 features 22 ads -- not counting in-house blurbs.
The ads include messages from Bell Canada, Chrysler Capital
Corp. and two banks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unfortunately for Mont Saint-Sauveur, it had to give the
ads away. That wasn't the original plan, says Mr. Hebert,
chairman and president of the company, which operates ski
resorts in Quebec and Vermont.
   The company's first goal was to make the annual report
more interesting. "I'm a chartered accountant, and even I
always thought annual reports were boring," Mr. Hebert says.
   The second goal was to cut costs. After deciding to put
out Saint-Sauveur's report in the form of a tabloid-size
newspaper, the inclusion of in-house ads was an obvious idea.
From that point, it wasn't much of a leap to try and really
cut costs by selling ads.
   The market wasn't ready. "People resisted the idea," Mr.
Hebert admits. Instead, Mont Saint-Sauveur offered its
suppliers free advertising space. "It may generate more
business," says Newport, Vt., attorney Robert Chimileski of
his ad. But asked if he'd pay, Mr. Chimileski answers, "I
wouldn't think so."
   Mont Saint-Sauveur's annual report is probably a first in
Canada, says Grace Lew, who watches annual-report trends for
the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The only
thing that came close in Canada is the annual report of a
Toronto-based newspaper publisher; that report used a tabloid
format, but didn't include outside ads.
   As it turned out, Saint-Sauveur didn't save a dime, Mr.
Hebert says. This year's effort cost just as much as last
year's more conventional report, about five Canadian dollars
($4.30) a copy. And it was a lot more work. But Mr. Hebert
isn't giving up. "Eventually we'll break even on our annual
report," he says.

   The world's moralists seem to have reached a consensus
about how to deal with Iraq. To wit, the moral course is to
mount a blockade, the burden of which will fall on
noncombatants -- women, children, conquered Kuwaitis and the
Iraqi people. But, they say, do not think of bombing Iraqi
chemical-weapons sites, let alone trying to defeat the Iraqi
military machine in open combat. Such "unprovoked" use of
force is immoral.
   Of course it is preferable to achieve our purposes without
violence, without taking any casualties or inflicting any.
But look unblinkingly at the purposes President Bush outlined
Tuesday night: an immediate and unconditional Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait; measures to ensure more permanent
peace in the vital Persian Gulf; a halt to the spread of
chemical, biological, missile and nuclear weapons; the
consummation of a lesson that aggression will not be
tolerated. As the remarkable degree of world consensus
attests, these purposes are both just and vital to stability
and progress in the emerging, highly interdependent world
order.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The chance that Saddam Hussein will relent and withdraw
unconditionally is, it should by now be apparent, highly
theoretical. There also is a chance that he would be replaced
in a coup, but somehow dictators who rule by terror seldom
are. And in either case, it is difficult to imagine an
agreement to destroy chemical weapons, halt the Iraqi nuclear
program and reduce the Iraqi military to a size that does not
threaten its neighbors, not to mention the return of the loot
taken during the aggression. The "moderate" option of
containing Saddam over the next generation almost surely
would undermine our Arab allies, and is a de facto
recognition of his conquest. If President Bush's purposes are
to be achieved, the odds are overwhelming that they will have
to be achieved by force.
   Naturally one should be prudent. While marshaling his
forces and building consensus, President Bush has allowed
time for diplomacy by the Arab states, the UN Secretary
General and so on. With his first armored forces now deployed
in Saudi Arabia, he may want to try again to achieve his aims
with the threat of force rather than its use -- for example
by the blockade of Kuwaiti air space suggested on our pages
by Albert Wohlstetter and Fred Hoffman. But such options
depend on a willingness to use, sooner or later, whatever
force is necessary to achieve the full menu of the
President's stated purposes.
   The lesson of military history, indeed, is that if force
must be used it should be used decisively. It is the instinct
of the American people that military action is serious
business -- to be avoided if possible but, when necessary,
not to be invoked in half-hearted ways. We have been
struggling since the end of World War II, to be sure, with
the issue of how to apply this lesson in an age of nuclear
weapons, given their unimaginable destructiveness and
potential for carnage of noncombatants. In Korea, this issue
comprised the dispute between President Truman and General
MacArthur. In Vietnam we feared superpower conflict and its
potential for nuclear holocaust, so applied force through
incremental, gradual escalation. Our experience confirmed the
wisdom of history's lesson.
   The Iraqi invasion is the first aggression of a new era
precisely because superpower competition no longer protects
the local tyrant. The issue is whether the world will allow
such brazenness even without superpower protection and the
threat of nuclear war; if so it will be a dark portent for
the future in general, and in particular for the potential
American hostages throughout the world.
   There is of course no thought of employing nuclear
weapons, since we want to maintain moral and prudential
restraints on their use. We would like if possible to extend
such restraints to chemical and other weapons of mass
destruction likely to take a huge toll of civilians. But to
achieve the President's aims in Iraq we probably will need to
use force decisively in the classic military sense of
destroying the enemy's capacity and will to resist.
   The American armed forces have digested the lesson of the
Vietnam escalation better than anyone, if anything perhaps
too well. The generals certainly are right in wanting a force
large enough to crack the Iraqi army swiftly, but there also
is a risk that unrealistically large requirements can become
an excuse for inaction. By now, after all, we have
overwhelming air power, a Security Council blessing, control
of the seas, and some 20 allies committed. American armored,
airborne and marine divisions now face Iraq, not to overlook
a large Turkish army on its northern border. President Bush
has visited Chairman Gorbachev to make sure the Soviets stand
aside, and visited Congress to cement its backing and rally
the American people. Most of the pieces are in place for a
decisive blow.
   A few weeks more time would provide more tanks and more
troops, but also carry the risk of political complications
and erosion of the alliance. The passage of time, above all,
is likely to expose the moral ambiguity of the current policy
of pseudo-war. The President already has said we will allow
the shipment of medicine to the sick and food to babies. Is
it our policy to starve babies not to the point of death, but
only to malnutrition? How long can this be sustained, and
what outcome might justify it?
   President Bush, of course, must bear the decision of
balancing the chances of avoiding further violence, the
pressures of time and the need for decisive action. But his
decision need not be clouded by sentimentality masquerading
as morality. When war looms, acting decisively and seeking a
speedy conclusion is not only the best military choice but
the best moral choice.

   Capital-Goods Firms Expect to Eke Out
   Small Sales Gains Despite Any Recession

   Some economists say the U.S. economy already is in a
recession. If that's true, then the downturn this time may
turn out to be anything but typical.
   Consider the situation among capital-goods manufacturers.
Although business isn't booming at factories that make
tractors, machinery, trucks, machine tools and other heavy
goods, most producers expect to eke out small sales gains in
both 1990 and 1991 even if the overall economy continues to
show little or no growth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's a big change from the past. Once, when the economy
caught cold, makers of capital goods got pneumonia. Now, many
manufacturing executives and economists say this recession,
if it materializes, will differ from the classic downturn in
which manufacturers, particularly capital-goods producers,
are hardest hit.
   Of course, capital-goods makers aren't safe yet. War in
the Middle East could scuttle the entire economy. Moreover,
it's too early to say with certainty that the capital-goods
industry can avoid recession -- generally defined as two
consecutive quarters of economic decline -- because capital
spending typically lags behind the business cycle.
   So far, though, prospects look surprisingly good for a
wide array of U.S. equipment makers. Duriron Co., for
instance, expects record sales and earnings in 1990 and 1991,
says John S. Haddick, chief executive officer of the Dayton,
Ohio, producer of corrosion-resistant pumps and valves.
"World-wide capital spending by the chemical process
industries is going to continue strong through 1991," he
adds, a trend from which Duriron benefits.
   Economists and businessmen offer several explanations for
capital-goods makers' relative prosperity this time around.
Many of these concerns are leaner now, having greatly
improved their product quality and manufacturing efficiency
since the most recent devastating downturn of 1981-82. For
instance, Ingersoll Rand Co., a machinery maker that posted
record second-quarter net income, now generates more sales
than it did a decade ago with one-third fewer employees.
   They're also benefiting greatly from an increased reliance
on exports. Capital-goods makers generally sell a much higher
portion of their output overseas than they once did. And
foreign demand remains robust.
   In 1989, for instance, capital-goods exports jumped 14%
and are expected to rise almost that much this year, says
Adrian T. Dillon, chief economist for Eaton Corp., a
Cleveland-based producer of truck parts and electrical
products. Mr. Dillon expects a 9% to 10% increase next year.
The reasons: Growing economies in Europe and the Far East are
strong markets for U.S. equipment; some Latin American
countries are showing signs of recovery after a decade of
stagnation; and a weak dollar makes U.S. goods more cost
competitive abroad.
   Indeed, for many capital-goods makers, rising exports
mitigate the impact of the U.S. slowdown. U.S. machine tool
factories received $270 million in orders for export in the
first seven months of 1990, up 23% from a year earlier,
according to the machine tool builders' trade association.
   "Exports are continuing to expand at a fast clip and that
will keep the industrial sector humming," asserts Joseph J.
McAlinden, director of securities research at Dillon Read and
a fan of several industrial stocks.
   In addition, American companies, facing worsening global
competition, continue to buy equipment to improve
productivity despite the sluggish U.S. economy. A U.S.
Commerce Department survey made in July and August signaled a
5.1% inflation-adjusted rise in capital spending this year,
less than half the 10.4% increase racked up in 1989, but
still far stronger than the overall economy.
   Mr. McAlinden believes, moreover, that higher oil prices
stemming from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait also will trigger
more capital spending for energy-related investments. Oil
drilling and related storage and transmission equipment is
one obvious example.
   For instance, at CBI Industries Inc., an Oak Brook, Ill.,
supplier of processing equipment to the energy and paper
industries, among others, net income was up 60% in this
year's first half. And if higher oil prices lead to a global
surge in spending for energy-related facilities, as Mr.
McAlinden expects, CBI would be a big beneficiary. For that
reason, he currently recommends CBI stock.
   Of course, not all sectors are faring well in the current
environment. For instance, Caterpillar Inc., the Peoria,
Ill., maker of equipment for the hard-hit construction
industry, is hurting. The company reported a 67% drop in
second-quarter profit partly because the U.S. construction
slowdown chopped sales of earth-moving equipment.
   The story is much different, though, in nearby Moline,
Ill. Says a spokesman for Moline-based Deere &amp; Co., the
nation's largest maker of tractors and farm machinery: "Next
year should be another good year for North American farm
machinery sales," even if the overall economy is flat or
declines slightly.
   Planted acreage is likely to rise, farm incomes are
strong, farmland prices are rising and farmers continue to
reduce their debts. In addition, Deere says, farmers still
are operating some old tractors and combines that would have
been replaced except for the drubbing farmers took in the
mid-1980s.
   Another factor giving rise to optimism is relatively lean
inventories. Typically, a sales slowdown triggers a massive
reduction of business stocks, which requires factory
closings, widespread layoffs and other efforts to slash
output. That's followed by cuts and cancellations of orders
for new equipment.
   However, that cycle could be averted this time because
many companies whacked inventories in the last half of 1989
and the first few months of this year. Manufacturing
inventories at the end of the second quarter were equal to
1.54 months of sales, one of the lowest ratios in the past 40
years, according to the American Production &amp; Inventory
Control Society of Falls Church, Va.

   SADDLE BROOK, N.J. -- Lexington Management Corp., a unit
of Piedmont Management Co., New York, said it will eliminate
sales charges on purchases of shares of three mutual funds,
effective Sept. 12.
   The three funds are: Lexington Corporate Leaders Trust
Fund, with assets of $87.6 million; Lexington Global Fund,
with assets of $52 million; and Lexington Technical Strategy
Fund, with assets of about $9 million. Previously, the fund
management company imposed maximum sales charges of between
4% and 5% on the funds.

   Dollar Dives Against Yen,
   Hitting a 13-Month Low

   The dollar sank to a 13-month low against the yen, and
many traders think it will fall even further.
   Expectation of lower U.S. interest rates played a role in
the drop, as did massive sales of dollars and European
currencies by Japanese companies that want to bring home
profits they have earned abroad.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There is absolutely no reason to buy dollars vs. yen,"
said Belal Khan, a corporate trader at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New
York. He added that the difference in yields between
dollar-denominated and yen investments had shrunk "so much
that the Japanese might as well keep their money at home."
   In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 138.09 yen,
down from 140.30 yen on Tuesday. The U.S. currency rose to
1.5913 marks from 1.5855 marks a day earlier. Meanwhile, the
pound edged up to $1.8594 from $1.8580 on Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 137.35 yen, down from 138.30 yen at the close there
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5935 marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5820
marks.
   The dollar's latest slump follows its retreat this summer
against the mark and other European currencies. Since 1989
ended, the dollar has fallen 4% against the yen, nearly 6%
against the mark and 13% against the pound. Late last month,
the U.S. currency fell to its lowest rate against the mark
since the German currency was established after World War II.
   Yesterday, the dollar fell to its lowest point during
European trading -- 137.47 yen, or 14% below its high for the
year of 159.79 yen, set on April 3. The currency then
recovered a bit as traders who sold the dollar short took
profits by buying dollars back. A month ago, the U.S.
currency was trading as high as 150.45 yen. Its previous low
was 137.20 yen, set on Aug. 3, 1989.
   "Whatever's been going on in this market, it's totally a
yen play," said Joseph Volpicella, foreign-exchange trading
manager at Westpac Banking Corp. in New York. "It's going to
continue until at least the end of September or until
{Japanese companies and banks} get their books the way they
want them."
   The first half of the fiscal year for most Japanese
corporations and financial institutions ends Sept. 30. And
the need to boost earnings, or at least to reduce trading
losses, is prompting many multinational Japanese companies to
cash in profits they have in overseas markets and bring the
money home.
   "Japanese banks, institutional investors and multinational
corporations have been repatriating profits back to Japan to
dress up their books," said Mr. Khan of Fuji Bank. "Some of
the institutional investors feel the U.S. is no longer a
place to have their money because the U.S. is headed for a
recession, and that a {U.S.} budget agreement may be agreed
to by Sept. 28" -- the last business day of the month. Some
traders and analysts believe a budget agreement would allow
the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy and lower U.S.
interest rates.
   Analysts said that data assembled by Japan's Ministry of
Finance shows that in the first six months of this year,
Japanese investors sold a net $8.9 billion of U.S. stocks and
bonds. Japanese institutional investors are so eager to
"dress up" their books for the accounting period ending Sept.
30 that traders attributed yesterday's dollar rise against
the mark and other continental European currencies to sales
of those currencies against the yen.
   The dollar is often used as an intermediary in such
"cross-rate" transactions. For instance, a trader seeking to
buy yen and sell marks might initially sell marks for dollars
and then sell the dollars for yen. Such trades tend to boost
the U.S. currency against its German counterpart while
weakening it against Japan's currency.
   "People are speculating on a U.S. budget deficit cut,"
said Yoichi Sakaguchi, chief trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in New
York. He conceded that "this is the same old story: waiting
for the U.S. to reduce its deficit." But Mr. Sakaguchi added
that he and others in the currency market thought President
Bush's address to a joint session of Congress -- unlike
earlier speeches -- was "decisive on a budget deficit cut."
   If U.S. interest rates do decline, the dollar could fall
further. That's because lower rates usually reduce a
currency's allure to international investors. Similarly,
higher Japanese interest rates would increase the appeal of
the yen. Even though the Bank of Japan raised its discount
rate -- at which it lends to financial institutions -- 0.75
percentage point to 6% late last month, many traders and
analysts believe the central bank will boost the official
rate again to counter domestic inflationary pressures.
   Indeed, a major underlying reason for the dollar's
weakness against most foreign currencies is the expectation
of lower U.S. rates and higher rates abroad. Three-month
Eurodollar deposits -- dollars that are deposited outside the
U.S. -- currently yield 8.125%. That compares with 8.438% for
equivalent yen deposits, 8.375% for marks to be delivered
three months hence and 14.875% for pounds.
   In addition, the dollar continues to be burdened by a
softening U.S. economy and the large U.S. budget deficit. So
far, these economic factors have overshadowed the dollar's
traditional role as a "haven" currency during times of
international tension. Many traders believe the dollar won't
reacquire its status as a haven as long as Iraq and the
nations allied against it try to deal with the Mideast crisis
diplomatically rather than militarily.
   At the same time, most analysts believe the fast-growing
Japanese economy is better prepared than the U.S.'s to cope
with the inflationary and trade-deficit effects of higher oil
prices.
   The major assault on the dollar occurred early Wednesday
during Asian trading hours, a trend of the last several days.
"We are in a situation now where New York is kind of the
clean-up market; the big moves are occurring in Asia," said
John Lyman, a senior corporate dealer at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
in New York.
   He said that the attack began with Federal Reserve
Governor "Martha Seger's comment that traditional easing by
the Fed may not be enough to avert a {U.S.} recession."
   Traders said that their Japanese counterparts also
unloaded dollars on a Tuesday report by the U.S. General
Accounting Office that 35 large U.S. banks are in danger of
failing. Adding fuel to the fire were a series of rumors,
subsequently found to be baseless, concerning a discount-rate
increase by the Bank of Japan, a U.S. budget accord and the
flight of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Dealers said the dollar's fall accelerated when it dropped
below 138.80 yen, a key support level on charts used by
traders to predict currency movements. Mr. Khan of Fuji Bank
said that 135.80 yen was another key level.
   Mr. Sakaguchi of Sanwa Bank predicted that the dollar will
possibly continue to weaken to about 135 yen by the end of
the month. Other analysts and traders agree.
   The yen is also expected to climb against European
currencies. Mr. Lyman of Bank of Tokyo said that a rate of 82
yento the mark "is very possible," down from 86.778 yen late
Wednesday. On Tuesday, one mark bought 88.489 yen.
   "People suddenly noticed the uncertainty surrounding the
unification of Germany, the high cost" associated with it.
"So they are buying yen against marks or other
Eurocurrencies," said Mr. Sakaguchi. "This is a kind of
unwinding operation, after Japanese investors had bought
European currencies several months ago."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $382.10 an ounce, up $1.60. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $382.25 an
ounce.

   A state judge in New York temporarily barred St. Martin's
Press from selling a book about the Israeli intelligence
service, the Mossad.
   State Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Dontzin signed the
order early yesterday morning after lawyers for the Israeli
government argued that publication of the book would endanger
lives and disclose confidential in formation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Justice Dontzin ordered the New York publishing house to
recall approximately 18,000 copies of the book that have
already been shipped. And St. Martin's said an additional
30,000 orders are being withheld from distribution as a
result of the judge's order.
   The book, "By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of
a Mossad Officer," was written by Victor Ostrovsky. Mr.
Ostrovsky, who now lives in Canada, claims he spent two years
as a Mossad agent. He wrote the book in collaboration with
Claire Hoy, a Canadian journalist.
   A Canadian court last week barred the book's Canadian
publisher, Stoddart Publishing Co. of Toronto, from
continuing production or releasing the book before Sept. 17,
when a hearing is expected to be held, a spokeswoman for
Stoddart said.
   Roy Gainsburg, president of St. Martin's, said he believed
this was the first time that a foreign government had
successfully enjoined publication of a book in the U.S.
   Jonathan J. Lerner, a lawyer representing the Israeli
government, said the book's author had violated a
confidentiality agreement not to divulge any secrets. "If a
CIA agent were seeking to publish vital U.S. secrets in
Israel, wouldn't we expect the Israeli courts to protect
those secrets?" said Mr. Lerner, a lawyer with the New York
firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.
   First Amendment lawyers said courts won't restrain the
publication of a book except in extraordinary situations.
These experts said the Israeli government's fears that the
book might endanger lives may have persuaded the judge to
issue the order.
   But P. Cameron DeVore, a First Amendment lawyer with the
Seattle firm Davis Wright Tremaine, said the U.S. Supreme
Court has held that such orders are unconstitutional unless
an immediate and direct threat to U.S. security -- not that
of a foreign government -- exists.
   "Even if this book is published, as I think it will be,
it's a setback that a restraint order was entered at all,"
said Floyd Abrams of the New York firm Cahill, Gordon &amp;
Reindel, a First Amendment expert.
   Israeli media reports indicated the book contains
allegations that the Mossad knew in advance about the
terrorist attack that killed 240 U.S. Marines in Beirut in
1983 and also includes information about Mossad espionage
activity inside the U.S.
   Justice Dontzin has scheduled a hearing for tomorrow to
review evidence to determine whether the ban should be
continued. But the appellate court is expected to consider
today St. Martin's request that the order be overturned
immediately.

   CAMERAS IN FEDERAL COURTS are approved as a limited
experiment.
   The Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the
federal courts, voted to allow a three-year experiment
allowing the use of cameras and broadcasting equipment in
civil trials in two federal appeals courts and six federal
district courts. The broadcasting experiment won't involve
criminal trials because rules of procedure prohibit it.
   The experiment, which begins in July 1991, will mark the
first time television or still cameras or radio broadcasting
equipment have been allowed in the federal courts in at least
50 years. In the past decade, most state court systems have
experimented with allowing cameras in courtrooms, and 44
states now allow broadcast of some trials.
   But the trend in the states was never matched in the
federal courts, due to the skepticism of many judges and the
adamant opposition of Chief Justice Warren Burger, who
retired in 1986. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, although
firmly opposed to televising Supreme Court sessions,
appointed a committee in 1988 to study the use of cameras in
other federal courts.
   Last month, the committee recommended the three-year
experiment, and yesterday the 27-judge Judicial Conference
gave its permission. A conference spokesman said the approval
was on a voice vote, but that a few judges expressed
objections at the closed-door session.
   Once the participating courts are chosen, the experiment
will be conducted under restrictions set by the Judicial
Conference. News media wishing to televise a trial must
notify the judge in advance; the request may be refused at
the judge's discretion.
   The experiment will be evaluated by the Federal Judicial
Center, the judiciary's research arm, after it is concluded
in June 1994. Any decision to open the federal courts further
for broadcasting will depend on the evaluation.
   The experiment doesn't include the Supreme Court, which
isn't covered by the Judicial Conference's action. It is up
to the nine justices to decide whether to allow television
coverage, and they repeatedly have rejected requests by
lopsided votes.

   FTC INVESTIGATES recruiting by law firms.
   The Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether major
law firms are violating antitrust laws by cooperating with
each other in their recruiting and hiring of law students.
   The investigation, believed to be the first of its kind,
focuses on agreements among big law firms to limit expenses
related to recruiting, such as airline tickets, hotel
accommodations and restaurant meals, according to people
familiar with the inquiry.
   The FTC has targeted law firms based in Cleveland. It
isn't known how many firms are under scrutiny or whether
firms from other cities also are involved.
   In the annual competition for top graduating law students,
large firms routinely coordinate and share expenses
associated with interviewing and wooing potential associates.
The FTC apparently believes that such coordination may
include illegal collusion to limit costs and restrain
competition for sought-after recruits.
   Without "confirming or denying" any specific
investigation, FTC official Michael McNeely said that "if the
firms agree on the level of wining and dining people," they
may be violating federal antitrust laws.
   Employees with three Cleveland firms -- Arter &amp; Hadden,
Baker &amp; Hostetler and Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey -- confirmed
that they were under investigation. Another firm under
scrutiny is Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, according to people
familiar with the FTC action. The FTC's investigation was
first reported this week by Legal Times, a Washington trade
paper.
   If the commission determines that antitrust laws have been
violated, it could seek to impose fines on the law firms and
request a court order barring anti-competitive recruiting
practices.
   Arter &amp; Hadden's managing partner, Robert Glaser, called
the investigation "ludicrous" and denied any wrongdoing by
his firm or the others under scrutiny.
   Mr. Glaser acknowledged that law firms coordinate student
interview trips, and that this cooperation saves costs for
the firms. But he insisted that coordination takes place
primarily for students' benefit and only when requested by
students. "We aren't limiting our recruiting," he said. "We
aren't colluding on who we invite. We hire independently."
   Employees with Baker &amp; Hostetler and Squire Sanders
confirmed that the firms are being investigated but declined
to elaborate. An employee with Jones Day said the firm's
managing partner, Richard Pogue, wasn't available to comment.

   INVESTORS SUING DREXEL seek relief from court stay.
   The judge overseeing Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s
bankruptcy case has been asked to allow six lawsuits to go
forward accusing Drexel, its former junk-bond chief Michael
Milken and others of a massive conspiracy to rig the
junk-bond market.
   The federal and state civil lawsuits are class actions
filed by investors who allege an intertwined scheme of
securities-law violations, racketeering and other wrongdoing.
In the alleged scheme, sometimes referred to as a daisy
chain, Mr. Milken, Drexel and several corporate raiders are
accused of creating a false market for the securities through
sham transactions and price manipulation.
   Some of the suits also blame the alleged scheme for
exacerbating the crisis in the savings and loan industry.
Federal regulators and Congress have begun their own
investigations into possible criminal activity in the alleged
scheme.
   Although trial dates have already been set for some of the
lawsuits, the cases can't go forward because of an automatic
stay that goes into effect when a company files for
bankruptcy-law protection. Drexel filed under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code on Feb. 13.
   "The public interest demands that there be a full public
airing and fair prosecution of all civil claims relating to
Drexel's notorious operations, and that the bankruptcy laws
not be used as an offensive weapon to shield the responsible
wrongdoers," the plaintiffs said in a motion filed in federal
bankruptcy court in Manhattan. The motion was filed by
Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie &amp; Lerach, which represents
the securities class-action group.
   The motion argues that it will be impossible for Drexel to
come up with a feasible bankruptcy reorganization plan
without getting a better handle on the damages it will face
from the litigation. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard
Buschman III set a hearing for Oct. 2 on the request.
   A spokesman for Drexel said the company will file its
response to the motion later this month. He said, "The reason
for a stay in bankruptcy proceedings is, among other things,
to allow the debtor to develop a comprehensive plan in an
organized way without the need to attend to a multitude of
separate claims."
   Under the plaintiffs' proposal, the court would allow the
cases to continue until damages, if any, are determined, but
it wouldn't allow the plaintiffs to try to collect the money.

   FORMER HUGHES AIRCRAFT employee wins whistle-blower suit.
   A state Superior Court jury in Los Angeles awarded $1.95
million to a former Hughes Aircraft Co. employee who
contended he was fired after accusing the company of
overcharging the government on defense contracts.
   After five days of deliberations, the jury upheld claims
made by Bobby Coffey, 55 years old, who had worked at Hughes
for more than two decades. As a program-cost analyst at
Hughes's missile division, Mr. Coffey pointed out allegedly
fraudulent practices in which the company overcharged the
government for labor and materials. Melanie Lomax, Mr.
Coffey's attorney, alleged yesterday that the overcharging
amounted to "hundreds of thousands, if not millions" of
dollars.
   Mr. Coffey also claimed age discrimination, but the jury
didn't uphold that particular claim, said Hughes, a unit of
General Motors Corp.
   The company, which is planning to appeal, has denied that
it ever overcharged the government and maintains that Mr.
Coffey was dismissed because he had falsified a time card.
"We feel the verdict was not consistent with the evidence
that was presented," said a spokesman for Hughes.

   FORMER TAKEOVER LAWYER at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp;
Flom pleaded guilty to three insider-trading counts. Steven
Glauberman, a former Skadden Arps associate, pleaded guilty
to two counts of disclosing confidential information that he
learned at the firm and one count of trading on such
information. Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in federal court
in Manhattan set sentencing for Dec. 21. Mr. Glauberman is
cooperating with prosecutors in the case, in which three
other defendants have been named.
