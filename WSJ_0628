   NEW YORK -- New construction contracts rose 6% in May from
a four-year low in April, reflecting a surge in contracting
for public works projects, according to F.W. Dodge, the
forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.
   Contracts for nonresidential building rose 6% from April
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $82.89 billion.
Residential building contracts, for newly started one-family
homes and apartments, edged up 4% to $110.55 billion.
Nonbuilding construction-public works and utilities, climbed
12% to $50.88 billion, its best level so far in 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dodge said three waterway development projects being built
by the U.S. Corps of Engineers in Oregon, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania gave an added lift to the generally improved
level of building activity.
   The Dodge index, which compares current contracting levels
against a 1982 base of 100, rebounded to 155 in May from 147
in April. Despite the stronger index, the year-to-date
contracting total of $97.29 billion remained 7% below the
comparable five-month period of 1989.
   George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist for
F.W. Dodge, said, "It appears that the recent slide of
construction contracting may be stabilizing at about 10%
below last year's value."
   The steepest decline in year-to-date value was in the
Northeast, where newly started construction was 24% below the
comparable five-month period of 1989. The greatest gain was
5% in the North Central region. The West remained even, while
the South was down 10%.

   NEW YORK -- Auction fever is hitting the publishing
industry once again, with two big-name novelists commanding
millions for books they haven't written yet.
   According to publishing executives, a division of Bantam
Doubleday Dell Publishing Group agreed this week to pay more
than $12 million in a ferociously competitive auction for two
novels by Ken Follett, author of the best sellers "Eye of the
Needle" and "The Key to Rebecca." And British novelist
Jeffrey Archer, who wrote "Kane &amp; Abel," is expected to
announce today that he will receive a total of more than $20
million for his next three books.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Word of the two transactions is sending a shock wave
through the publishing industry, where a number of companies
have been forced to write off the extravagant advances paid
to writers in past seasons. Just last fall, publishers vowed
that they wouldn't continue to pay huge advances to authors,
and literary agents reported that many authors were getting
lower offers than in recent years.
   "It was just wishful thinking that outrageous advances
were a thing of the past," said Phyllis Grann, president of
Putnam Berkley Group Inc., which publishes many best-selling
authors. "To me this is a very significant week in the
industry." Added the head of another major publisher: "This
is beyond irresponsible, beyond mathematics. This is like
throwing bundles of money out the window, and it's very
unhealthy for the industry."
   Carole Baron, president and publisher of Delacorte/Dell,
the division of West Germany's Bertelsmann AG that bought the
two Follett novels, declined to confirm the $12 million-plus
figure. She said the sum paid includes rights for the U.S.
and Canada and hardcover and paperback rights. "This is about
names that absolutely, positively deliver, making the
bestseller lists for both hardcover and paperback," said Ms.
Baron. "I think I made a prudent investment."
   Delacorte/Dell publishes such big names as Danielle Steel,
Belva Plain and Elmore Leonard, and it just had an unexpected
hit with a novel based on the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"
movie that sold more than two million paperback copies. But
"we don't have anybody quite like Ken Follett," said Ms.
Baron.
   Mr. Follett still has another novel to complete under a
contract to Hearst Corp.'s William Morrow &amp; Co. for hardcover
and British paperback publisher Penguin Books, both of which
dropped out of this week's auction. The $12 million "is
considerably more than we offered, but we won't know for
years who is right," said Peter Mayer, chief executive
officer of International Penguin Group, parent of Penguin
Books. "One can say that Ken Follett will have to sell a
great many more copies than he has sold in the past." By one
estimate, Mr. Follett's next publisher will have to sell
350,000 hardcover copies and more than two million paperbacks
of each novel, just to break even.
   Mr. Archer, reached in London, said "I think it's common
knowledge there was a pre-emptive bid six or eight weeks ago
for $20 million {for two novels and a book of short stories},
which I rejected." Mr. Archer wouldn't say which publisher
had made the offer or why he rejected it, but he confirmed
that an auction of his books is scheduled to conclude today.
   Jack Romanos, president of mass market publishing for the
Simon &amp; Schuster division of Paramount Communications Inc.,
said Simon &amp; Schuster, which has been Mr. Archer's publisher
in hardcover and paperback, had an option to acquire his next
book. "But we weren't willing to come up to the level of
advance he was looking for," said Mr. Romanos. "He is similar
to Follett in that his greatest success, "Kane &amp; Abel," was
about 10 years ago. From my perspective, you've got people
willing to pay in 1990 for something that happened in 1980."
   While these newest mega-advances are shocking the
industry, they don't break the record. Novelist Stephen King
has reportedly received advances of $30 million for his next
three books. But then, say publishing insiders, Mr. King
routinely sells more than one million copies in hardcover and
may be the only writer around who can demand that much money
and still leave his publisher with a profit.

   MECHANICSBURG, Pa. -- When Rocco Ortenzio started the
first of his health-care ventures, analysts called the idea a
long shot at best.
   Mr. Ortenzio, a physical therapist himself, planned
free-standing units providing beds and physical therapy for
patients recovering from severe head injuries, strokes and
other debilitating or chronic illnesses. His Rehab Corp.
would charge less than hospitals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Health-care analysts predicted that hospitals, which
typically provide some of the same services, would become
more aggressive and take away Mr. Ortenzio's patients.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Ortenzio's initial 1969 venture not only
succeeded but also encouraged others to start similar
companies. The 56-year-old entrepreneur has since sold Rehab
Corp. and another venture and is rapidly expanding his third
venture, Continental Medical Systems Inc. here.
   Tripling its presence over last year, Continental has 882
beds in 12 locations. And most of its new locations turn
profitable within six months, Mr. Ortenzio says. Analysts
predict earnings of about $8.8 million on revenue in excess
of $225 million in the fiscal year ending Saturday.
Continental now "is one of the largest and most experienced
in the business," says Joe France, a health-care industry
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Mr. Ortenzio is succeeding in a field that is surprisingly
filled with pitfalls. With companies trying desperately to
control health-care costs, anyone with a plausible answer
might seem to have a clear shot at riches.
   But a large share of the alternative health-care ventures
-- such as home health-care providers and emergency
free-standing clinics -- that proliferated in the 1980s to
cash in on the problem of rising health-care costs, have
perished, analysts say.
   Many of the ventures "weren't able to convince physicians
that they could provide these services cheaply and as
effectively as traditional providers," says Dorothy Ryan, who
follows health-care industries for Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
in San Francisco.
   Providers of emergency medical care -- often termed
"doc-in-the-boxes" -- often failed because they couldn't
establish themselves as legitimate and longstanding providers
of health care, says Ms. Ryan. Companies that provided
home-infusion therapy, for example, competed with the very
doctors who should have been their source of patients, she
says.
   The few companies that expanded nationally suffered
excessively rapid expansion and inconsistent quality,
industry experts say. Instead of providing economies of
scale, national expansion only raised marketing costs and
aggravated management headaches, says Chicago venture
capitalist Bryan Cressey.
   Most alternative health-care providers lacked experienced
managers to control their growth, says Peter Grua, a
healthcare industry analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, investment
bankers. "They often got ahead of themselves," he adds.
   By comparison, the rehabilitation-service providers like
Continental have filled a market niche and have taken
advantage of new technology to improve therapy, Mr. Grua
notes. And because these companies have generally established
new units in outlying areas, they have managed to create a
whole new work force, he adds.
   "Insurers and third-party payers have begun to realize how
cost-effective rehabilitation therapy is," says Smith
Barney's Mr. France. "There's a ready market for these
companies because improved medical technology has led to
increased survival rates from serious injuries."
   Mr. Ortenzio has capitalized on the need -- and avoided
pitfalls. After selling his two ventures, the first to
American Sterilizer Co. in 1974, the second to National
Medical Enterprises Inc. in 1984, Mr. Ortenzio co-founded
Continental Medical Systems with several of his former
associates in 1986.
   With the $26 million or so that venture capitalists
invested, Continental initially bought a chain of nursing
homes. But it soon began to re-establish itself in the
rehabilitation-services business. With the demand for
rehabilitation services growing at 10% to 15% annually,
"there still were tremendous opportunities in the business,"
Mr. Ortenzio says.
   Continental chose to grow through acquisitions before
starting new construction. The acquisitions helped the
company generate quick revenue instead of "burning money
upfront" in lengthy construction projects, explains Mr.
Cressey, the venture capitalist whose company has backed
Continental. They also provided the firm with a core of
veteran managers who have made expansion easier, he says.
   Continental also carefully selects new expansion sites. It
has stayed away from most major urban areas to avoid
potential competition from large health-care providers and
private physician groups. The marketing costs in big cities
can also be much higher, Mr. Ortenzio says. Instead, he has
settled for new locations in cities such as North Little
Rock, Ark., and Tustin, Calif. "We are responding to needs
that are there but are being met inefficiently," Mr. Ortenzio
says.
   Once it selects a site, the company works quickly. "They
are efficient developers," says Mr. Grua, the analyst. Having
previously developed 40 to 50 rehabilitation hospitals, the
company has developed an "efficient, basic plan for building
and design with no frills," he says.
   As construction continues, Continental sends in a
marketing "SWAT" team that talks to local hospitals and
physicians about the company's services. "We try and
emphasize that we aren't competing with them," Mr. Ortenzio
says. "We are simply trying to provide a new service that
will add value to what they already do."
   The strategy clearly has worked. But Continental and other
rehabilitation-service companies aren't exempt from potential
problems, especially given the current pressure to reduce
health-care costs. "Their strength is that they are providing
a service that others haven't been able to provide as
efficiently," says Ms. Ryan of Robertson Stephens. But if
reimbursements are reduced, these companies won't be
untouched, she says.
   That doesn't alarm Mr. Ortenzio. He predicts a need for as
many as 50,000 rehabilitation beds by 1993, more than double
the current capacity of 23,000 beds. And, he adds, "as long
as we are producing quality care -- at (a cost of) as much as
20% less than at traditional hospitals -- we will be a
long-term player."

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush announced major trade,
investment and debt initiatives for Latin America.
   As proposed, the new U.S. policy envisions substantial
debt relief on the nearly $12 billion outstanding in U.S.
government credits to the region. It also would set aside as
much as $300 million a year in grants from a new fund
administered by the Inter-American Development Bank to foster
private investment, and it foresees an eventual free-trade
zone running the length and breadth of the Western
Hemisphere.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Throughout the region, nations are turning away from the
statist economic policies that stifle growth -- and are now
looking to the power of the free market to help this
hemisphere realize its untapped potential for progress,"
President Bush said in calling for "a new economic
partnership." Prosperity in the Western Hemisphere, he said,
"depends on trade, not aid."
   The new initiative, which the White House termed the
Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, is an attempt to lift
Latin America off the rocks of economic stagnation, bolster
the region's recent move toward democracy, and provide
opportunities similar to those that are being offered to
Eastern Europe. But, as with U.S. efforts to aid Warsaw Pact
countries, the Bush Latin America initiative sets large goals
while pledging relatively small financial commitments, a
result of the great concern over the U.S. budget deficit.
   Moreover, to achieve success, the new approach will
require cooperation from the Latin American nations,
substantial backing from Congress as well as a strong
commitment from Europe and Japan.
   Still, the plan would represent a substantial change from
the Reagan years, when U.S. policy toward Latin America was
characterized primarily by support for the Nicaraguan Contras
and on managing, rather than reducing, the region's
overwhelming foreign debt burden.
   Latin American officials said Mr. Bush's proposals could
refocus world attention, which has been turned largely to the
upheavals in Eastern Europe, back on their region. "The
initiative makes the world think of Latin America, and Latin
America think of the world, particularly before the economic
summit in Houston," said Enrique Iglesias, the head of the
Inter-American Development Bank, a multilateral development
bank for the Western Hemisphere. Leaders of the Western
industrial nations are set to meet in Houston early next
month.
   On trade, Mr. Bush's plan has three elements. First, he
pledged the U.S. to "close cooperation" with Latin American
countries in the current Uruguay round of world trade talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Second, he said the U.S. is ready "to enter into free
trade agreements with other markets in Latin America and the
Caribbean -- particularly with groups of countries that have
associated for trade liberalization." The first step in this
process, he said, is a free trade agreement with Mexico. The
"ultimate aim," according to Mr. Bush, is "a free-trade
system that links all the Americas -- North, Central and
South" into a comprehensive free-trade area.
   Third, with countries that aren't ready for free-trade
agreements, the U.S. is prepared to negotiate closer trade
ties, Mr. Bush said.
   To boost investment, the president appealed to Latin
American countries to cut red tape and adopt regulations to
make it easier for international investors to put money into
the area. He also said the U.S. would contribute $100 million
annually to a proposed $300 million-a-year fund that would be
administered by the Inter-American Development Bank to
promote privatization and market-oriented reforms. The U.S.
intends to seek matching funds from Europe and Japan for the
fund, which the Treasury said would continue for five years.
   Mr. Bush proposed that the IADB join the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund in efforts to cut back
commercial bank debts and interest payments in the region.
But cutting back bank obligations hasn't helped some
countries in the region -- such as Honduras, El Salvador and
Jamaica -- that primarily owe money to foreign governments.
   Officials said the U.S. would propose substantial
write-offs -- in some cases more than 50% -- in the $7
billion outstanding in aid loans U.S. government agencies
have made at below-market rates to the most heavily burdened
countries. And they said the U.S. will sell a portion of its
$5 billion market-rate loans to help facilitate
debt-for-equity and debt-for-nature swaps. How much of the $5
billion would be sold wasn't disclosed.
   The officials said the administration is particularly
eager to help environmental programs, and in some cases will
let Latin American nations use local-currency interest
payments to pay for conservation projects.
   Still, Latin America's total official debt owed to the
U.S. is a small part of the region's $400 billion in foreign
debt.
   The administration's proposals seemed to be warmly
received. It's "a conceptually exciting and progressive
initiative appropriate for the economic conditions of the
1990s," said Richard Feinberg, executive vice president of
the Economic Development Council, a Washington-based private
think-tank that specializes in development issues.
   Bankers also liked the new U.S. government involvement in
debt relief and the proposals to jump-start the regional
economy. "This is the first time I've heard the U.S.
government focus on economic development in Latin America in
the regional sense and giving it the priority the president
gave it," said John Reed, chairman of Citicorp. "Official
debt reduction . . . is logical and positive," said Peter
McPherson, executive vice president at BankAmerica Corp. and
a former deputy secretary of the Treasury.

   If Anyone Makes a Fuss About It,

   As the Fourth of July approaches, those uninhibited
public-relations people in Philadelphia are at it again,
shamelessly bragging for the third straight year about having
"the world's largest birthday cake."
   If only it were true; but, alas, the claim seems
half-baked.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Once again, the concoction, sponsored by convenience-store
operator Wawa Inc., will be 80 feet long, 10 feet wide and
weigh about 1,800 pounds. On the nation's birthday, an
estimated 25,000 people milling around the Liberty Bell will
be offered a little taste of freedom, including a portion
iced to look like the American flag.
   The unpatriotic implications of flag eating
notwithstanding, celebration organizers prefer heaping on the
superlatives. Dava Guerin, vice president and group
supervisor at Weightman Schaefer, the festival's
public-relations firm, confidently says the cake "actually is
the world's largest." She adds: "I don't know how it's going
to taste, but it is the world's largest."
   Local newspapers have already trumpeted the coming of the
cake, but for three years, it seems, no one has questioned
the claims about its record size.
   However, Martin Day, an editor for the Guinness Book of
World Records in London who hadn't heard of Philadelphia's
claim, reports the world's largest cake -- 90,000 pounds, 84
feet by 114 feet -- was served up in 1986 in Austin, Texas.
Britain's Prince Charles sliced it with his sword to
celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the
republic of Texas.
   According to Guinness, Philadelphia's cake doesn't even
beat the first world's-biggest-cake on record, which emerged
from the oven in 1958 at 10,000 pounds. For that matter,
neither does it beat the previous two years' alleged "world's
largest" cakes in Philadelphia; they were the same size and
from the same recipe.
   Frank Cooksey, who was mayor of Austin in 1986, says
Texans "aren't inclined to exaggeration like folks in
Philadelphia," and he thinks festival officials should "be
ashamed of themselves for making claims that can't be
substantiated."
   Ms. Guerin explains that the festival's boast is meant to
be figurative. "When you see something so big," she says, "it
is the most natural thing to call it the world's largest."
   But the cake's baker, who requests anonymity, concedes
that it might be safer just to call his creation the world's
largest "regular Fourth of July birthday cake in Philadelphia
on that day."

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Wine:
   Money, Hope and Glory in the Italian Hills
   ----
   By Barbara Ensrud

</SO>
<LP>
   New York -- Money, hope and glory . . . Angelo Gaja first
heard those words at the tender age of eight. As a boy, Mr.
Gaja (pronounced Guy-ya), one of Italy's top wine producers,
used to spend the last weeks of summer vacation at his
grandmother's vineyard in the Langhe hills of the Piedmont in
northwestern Italy.
   "Wine is a good business," she would tell him as they
walked in the vineyard or through the maze of barrels in the
cellar. "It brings you three necessary things in life: money,
not a lot, perhaps, but enough, if the wine is good; hope,
that comes from always working to make the wine better; and,
if the wine is very good, a little bit of glory."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Winegrowing has brought all three to Mr. Gaja, and in
large measure. Dynamic and energetic, he is something of a
modern legend in the world of wine, one of a handful of
innovative Italian wine producers who have thrust Italy into
the vinous limelight with wines of intensity and finesse.
Barbaresco, the wine he made famous and the one that brought
him glory in return, is a firm, deep, long-lived red that for
years had stood in the shadow of the Piedmont's most famous
red, Barolo.
   Made from the same grape, the nebbiolo, Barolo and
Barbaresco come from steep hillsides of the Langhe west of
the medieval town of Alba, an area also known for such
gastronomic delights as white truffles and hazelnuts. Barolo
is the region's power red, inky and potent, usually
undrinkably tannic in its early years, beginning to mellow in
eight to 10. Barolo is stout and imperial, Barbaresco is
slender and svelte, a shade lighter in body with the focus
more on fruit and finesse than power. It can age just as long
as Barolo, and often does so with greater elegance and charm.
I much prefer, for instance, the Gaja 1964 Barbaresco to any
'64 Barolo that I've tasted.
   His work with Barbaresco is only one of the innovations
that has brought glory to Angelo Gaja. He was the first to
use small oak barrels for aging reds in the Piedmont. He
planted the first Cabernet Sauvignon vines in the Piedmont in
a century. He was among the first to bottle Barbaresco from
individual vineyards, each with its own identity (Sori San
Lorenzo, Sori Tilden, Costa Russi). Mr. Gaja's innovative
instincts became apparent as soon as he joined the family
operation in 1961.
   As the fifth generation of Gajas (who came to the Piedmont
from Spain in the 17th century), he was the first to halt the
practice of buying grapes and produce wines only from
family-owned vineyards. He studied wine making at the
Enological Institute in Alba as well as the University of
Montpellier in France, and holds a degree in economics from
the University of Turin in Italy.
   Mr. Gaja's grandmother, Clotilde Rey, managed to instill
in him her deep commitment to quality. The better the wine,
she told him repeatedly during his summer visits, the more
people will pay for it. "The words didn't mean much to me,
then," Mr. Gaja recalled during a visit here. "I was just a
kid; it wasn't till I was in my 30s that I began to realize
that all my efforts to produce the best were really inspired
by her."
   In her honor Mr. Gaja named his first Chardonnay vineyard,
planted in 1979, for her and his firstborn daughter, Gaia.
The 1984 Gaia y Rey Chardonnay created a sensation when it
appeared in 1986, was rated the top Chardonnay in the
Gault-Millaut wine olympiad and became the first Italian
Chardonnay to grace the wine lists of three-star restaurants
in France.
   Mr. Gaja planted Cabernet Sauvignon in 1979, five acres on
the hillside below the family home in the village of
Barbaresco -- much to the disapproval of his father,
Giovanni. Each time the elder Gaja passed the vineyard he
would shake his head in disgust and mutter "Darmagi]" which
means "What a pity]" in Piemontese dialect. So Mr. Gaja named
the vineyard Darmagi -- now a family joke since the Gaja
Cabernet commands $75 a bottle.
   It probably would bring more since there is so little
produced, under a thousand cases, but Mr. Gaja will not price
it above his vineyard-designated Barbarescos, which he feels
are his best wines. "I planted Chardonnay and Cabernet
because I couldn't resist the challenge of seeing how they
would do in the Piedmont," he said. "These are two of the
world's great wine grapes, both widely planted. What would
Piedmont Cabernet and Chardonnay be like? How would they
measure up to the best planted elsewhere?"
   Gaja Cabernet and especially the Chardonnay proved
themselves even beyond Mr. Gaja's expectations (and have
prompted others to plant Chardonnay in the Piedmont). But his
heart and soul remain commited to Barbaresco, to which his
family has deep emotional ties.
   His first single-vineyard Barbaresco was Sori San Lorenzo
("sori" means hilltop with a southern exposure; San Lorenzo
is the patron saint of Alba). It is the firmest and deepest
of Gaja Barbarescos, the one in need of longest aging. Costa
Russi, rich in texture, with the flavor of ripe berries, is
usually drinkable soonest. Sori Tilden, however, is the Gaja
wine most sought after. Fermented over the course of three to
four weeks, it combines power and finesse, offering the
greatest complexity of the three. Yet it is remarkably smooth
and harmonious, especially the currently available 1986.
   The '86 Barbarescos are somewhat less dramatic than those
of 1985, 1988 and probably 1989 -- all considered the
Piedmont's top vintages of the '80s. The prices of the 1986s
do not reflect lesser stature -- $93 for the Costa Russi, and
$95 each for the San Lorenzo and the Sori Tilden, but they
are more often seen on wine lists than in wine shops. In
fact, Mr. Gaja has been criticized to some extent for
catering to restaurants over private consumers.
   "I am not against private collectors," he insists, "but
what I don't like are the speculators who buy wine to trade,
not to drink. Our wines reach a wider audience in
restaurants."
   Just how far-flung his public is Mr. Gaja knows from
direct experience. He spends a great deal of time traveling
around the globe, far more than a decade ago, when English
was still a foreign language to him. Now, self-taught, he
speaks English fluently and clearly enjoys the ease with
which he can personally present his wines, not only here but
in the growing market of the Pacific Rim.
   Asia is only one of Mr. Gaja's current challenges. In 1988
the family purchased a 70-acre vineyard in the Serralunga
district of Barolo, an area noted for powerful, aggressively
tannic Barolo. The move surprised some who had rather
expected him to expand production with his successful
Cabernet and Chardonnay (he has in fact added another
Chardonnay, the Rossj-Baj). "I cannot say that people are
becoming bored with Cabernet Sauvignon," he explains, "but I
see interest in the market for something other than Cabernet.
Knowledgeable wine drinkers are looking for new tastes, and
Barolo and Barbaresco have scents and flavors that are
unique. The wines of recent vintages show more balance and
that, I think, is the direction for the future with nebbiolo.
The time is at hand for elegance rather then sheer opulence."
   The first estate-bottled Gaja Barolo, from the outstanding
vintage of 1988, will be available in 1992. No price has been
set as yet.

   Security Pacific
   Is Cleared to Buy
   Gibraltar Assets

   Security Pacific National Bank emerged as the successful
bidder, out of a field that included California's biggest
banks and thrifts, to acquire certain prime assets and
liabilities of Gibraltar Savings, Beverly Hills, Calif., from
the Resolution Trust Corp.
   The Security Pacific Corp. unit will assume about $3.9
billion in core deposits and $2.7 billion of loans covering
one-family to four-family residential housing. Security
Pacific also will gain Gibraltar's premium network of 83
branches in California.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This represents an important addition to Security
Pacific's customer base in key California markets," said a
spokesman for Security Pacific.
   Terms weren't disclosed. In a recent precedent, however,
Bank of America paid a price roughly equal to 4% of core
deposits when it acquired Western Savings of Arizona's
assets. By that yardstick, Security Pacific could be paying
about $150 million or more for the thrift.
   A Security Pacific spokesman said the bank expects to
announce additional details of the transaction tomorrow, or
as soon as a definitive agreement is signed with the RTC, the
federal agency that took over the ailing thrift.
   Regulators last year seized the thrift unit, declaring it
insolvent. Gibraltar Financial Corp., the parent of Gibraltar
Savings, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws in February. Since then, nearly a dozen banks
and thrifts have pored over the unit's records and considered
bids but many were believed to have dropped out of the
running earlier this month because of Gibraltar's
deteriorating condition. Security Pacific may have been able
to bid more because it can realize cost savings by closing
down operations and branches that overlap with its existing
facilities.
   Gibraltar Savings, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., was
placed in federal conservatorship after disastrous loans and
investments in commercial real estate and mortgage-backed
securites wiped out its capital. Even with the premium paid
by Security Pacific, the case is expected to cost the
government several hundred million dollars. The RTC retains
all of Gibraltar's multifamily, land and commercial
real-estate loans, amounting to about $2.5 billion.
   Donald Crowley, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods
Inc. in San Francisco, estimated that the sale price of the
Gibraltar assets was in the range of $150 million to $200
million.
   "In general, these deals tend to be running at about 4% of
core assets," he said, citing the Bank of America deal.

   AUSTRALIA'S `BARBARIANS'

   Australia's universities are producing science and
engineering graduates who are so specialized they are
incapable of relating to the rest of society, an Australian
Senate report claims.
   Sen. Terry Aulich, chairman of the Senate's Education
Committee, said his two-year inquiry suggested the country's
$2.6 billion education system is producing narrow-minded
graduates he dubbed "skilled barbarians."
   Universities "are cramming everything they can into a
three- or five-year course within a narrow field but not
teaching students how to live in a society and how it
functions," the Labor Party senator said, adding: "Some
contact with the humanities is absolutely essential."
   The report said many engineering, medicine and other
science graduates are "culturally illiterate." Even small
challenges outside their narrow fields left them floundering,
it said.
                                                                                                       

   FRANCE BANS ALL TOBACCO ADS
                                                                                                       

   France's National Assembly approved a ban on all tobacco
advertising and most liquor advertising starting in 1993. The
law forbids direct or indirect advertising for tobacco
products, including sponsorships of sports and cultural
events. Legislators from wine-growing regions succeeded in
excluding most wines from the liquor-ad ban. The bill is part
of an anti-smoking campaign by the government. Cigarette
prices are due to rise by 15% later this year, and the
national railroad announced this week that smoking is to be
banned on all of its commuter trains.
                                                                                                       

   TURNABOUT FOR NATO
                                                                                                       

   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will begin allowing
its diplomats and officials to travel to East Germany
whenever they like without special permission. "The rules
about travel were our own special little Berlin Wall and it's
starting to fall apart at last," said one NATO diplomat. The
travel restrictions, drawn up because of fears about security
leaks, entrapment or blackmail by communist agents, haven't
been lifted for any other Warsaw Pact state and also remain
in force for China, North Korea and Vietnam.
                                                                                                       

   TOKYO WATER SHORTAGE
                                                                                                       

   Tokyo might have to ration water this summer because of an
unusually dry rainy season, a spokesman for the Bureau of
Waterworks said. "Reservoirs are already more than half
empty," the spokesman said. The rainy season begins early in
June and ends in late July. This year there has been less
than half the normal rainfall in May and June. Officials from
Tokyo and the five neighboring prefectural governments will
meet today to discuss the problem.
                                                                                                       

   PAPER FROM FINLAND
                                                                                                       

   Finland's paper exporters said they would continue trading
with the Soviet Union after confirmation that the Soviets
have begun paying back debts totaling more than $25 million.
Thomas Nysten, president of Finnpap, the organization of
Finnish paper producers, said banks had confirmed receipt of
$15 million. "We also have unconfirmed information that the
Soviet Union has paid a further $2 million, so . . . we have
decided to continue paper deliveries to the U.S.S.R.," he
said. Last week, Finnish paper exporters suspended all trade
with the Soviet Union to protest the nonpayment of debts.
                                                                                                       

   SAPPORO VENTURE IN WASHINGTON
                                                                                                       

   Sapporo Breweries Ltd., Japan's second-largest beer
brewer, said it has teamed up with a U.S. farm operator to
buy vineyards in the state of Washington. Sapporo officials
said their company has established Sapporo Vineyards USA Inc.
in Seattle together with Wyckoff Farms Inc., operator of one
of the largest farms in Washington, to manage Snipes
Vineyards, which they bought for an undisclosed price. The
new company, capitalized at $2 million, is owned 51% by
Sapporo, 30% by Wyckoff Farms and the rest by a Japanese
trading house, Okura &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   AIRLINE LINKUP CHALLENGED
                                                                                                       

   The European Community Commission objected to the linkup
of British Airways, Sabena and KLM on the ground that some
aspects of the pact violate EC competition rules.
   Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for competition affairs,
said the commission will now enter into negotiations on how
to modify the linkup to meet EC competition rules. He said
the concept behind the linkup, which is to create a
Europewide air hub at Brussels Zaventem airport, is a good
one. But he said the form of the linkup among the three
airlines could harm competition among EC airlines.
   The linkup is effectively a unit of Sabena that is called
Sabena World Airlines. British Airways and KLM both have 20%
stakes in the venture, with the remainder held by Sabena, now
a holding company.
   Under EC rules, the companies have eight weeks to reply to
the objections.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Officials in Jakarta were set to meet today to discuss how
to rid the Indonesian capital's streets of beggars, including
children who sing for money. "People who beg have no
discipline," said one official. "By begging, they violate
regulations." . . . In Malaysia, a Thai man found guilty of
possessing a pistol was hanged, the national news agency
Bernama reported. Under Malaysian law, anyone found in
possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives can be
charged with a crime; if convicted, they can be sentenced to
death.

   Opponents to School-Voucher Law Lose
   First Round of Legal Fight in Wisconsin

   The Wisconsin Supreme Court narrowly declined to hear a
challenge to the state's controversial school-voucher law, in
a first-round legal victory for public-school adversaries.
   The battle over the law, the first that allows direct
public funding for private education, is being closely
watched by educators as a guidepost for school reform. A
growing number of radical reformers have argued that only a
free-market system using vouchers can correct what they
regard as the widespread failure of public schools. Teachers
and school officials, meanwhile, argue that vouchers will
lead to educational inequity and racial segregation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Wisconsin Supreme Court didn't weigh in on these
issues, ruling only in its 4-3 decision that opponents to the
law must first go to a lower court, which they did yesterday.
But backers of the law, including Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson, were heartened because the Supreme Court is
expected to hear the case on appeal, no matter who wins in
lower courts.
   The plaintiff opponents include the local affiliates of
the National Education Association and the American
Federation of Teachers, the country's two largest teachers
unions; the Milwaukee branch of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People; the state parent-teacher
association, and the Wisconsin Association of School District
Administrators.
   "I was disappointed for obvious reasons -- this is a
matter of substantial national and statewide concern," said
Robert Friebert, an attorney for the plaintiff group. But Mr.
Friebert said he was encouraged that Nathan S. Heffernan, the
state's chief justice, simultaneously urged lower courts to
hear the case quickly. Without a court ruling against the
law, students will begin using the vouchers this September.
   The law, passed in March, will allow as many as 1,000
students from low-income families to opt for private
nonsectarian schools in Milwaukee with state support. The
private schools will receive $2,500 in state funds for each
student they enroll.
   The main advocates of the law are Mr. Thompson, a white
Republican, and state Rep. Polly Williams, a black Democrat
who is eager to aid private schools serving black and
Hispanic children in her district. Opponents say the law
violates the state constitution because it would divert
public money to a private purpose without adequate controls.
   Separately, several schools that stand to benefit under
the law are seeking an injunction from a state court in
Milwaukee that would block the Wisconsin school
superintendent, Herbert J. Grover, from disqualifying them
for the vouchers. Mr. Grover wants written assurances, which
he hasn't yet received, that the schools will provide
services to the handicapped.
   After the supreme court decision late Tuesday, the law's
opponents filed to combine their case with the schools' case.
A hearing on the schools' lawsuit is scheduled for today.

   TOKYO -- Japan's major retail stores reported sales of
1.63 trillion yen ($10.54 billion) in May, up 10.4% from a
weak year-earlier level, but supported by continued strong
consumer demand for a broad range of items, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
   The high-paced year-to-year growth in May represents a
recovery from low levels a year earlier that owed to the
damping effect on sales of a 3% consumption tax introduced in
April 1989, an MITI official said, estimating that about 4%
of May's sales increase was accounted for by the depressed
year-ago level.

   Trio of Story Collections

   Reading the first story in Christopher Tilghman's first
collection of stories, "In a Father's Place" (Farrar, Straus
&amp; Giroux, 214 pages, $18.95), I thought (with dismay) that I
recognized the too-familiar terrain. "On the Rivershore"
introduces Cecil Mayberry, a typical American boy (who will
doubtless grow up to be a writer) undergoing an initiation
rite -- or in more casual parlance, a growth experience.
Cecil witnesses the murder of a local Chesapeake Bay
waterman. Heading for the Big House, Cecil conveys the news
to Mr. McHugh, the local authority figure, who knows just how
these things should be handled -- i.e., covered up. One
suspects this was chosen as the opening story on account of
its supposed shock effect, but there is remarkably little to
shock -- or even hold the attention of -- the reader in this
overly understated reworking of a theme that has long since
passed into the realm of cliches.
   The remaining six stories, however, are a pleasant
surprise. They, too, are rural in setting, understated in
style, and deal with venerable themes such as fathers and
sons, husbands and wives, values and a sense of place. But
each contains something fresh and unexpected, something that
shows that Mr. Tilghman is a realist who has observed reality
carefully enough to have noticed things other realist writers
have overlooked.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The title story portrays an uncomfortable encounter
between a middle-aged widower and his high-strung son's
girlfriend, an alarmingly tough, humorless graduate student
busily calculating the resale value of her fiance's family
heirlooms. "Norfolk, 1969" takes us into the mind and heart
of a young naval officer opposed to the Vietnam War, but
exhilarated by his shipboard experience; unable to consider
himself one of the career officers, but alienated by his
wife's conversion to the fringes of the antiwar movement. Mr.
Tilghman deftly picks out the tiny pressure points that lead
to an inevitable parting of the ways.
   "Loose Reins" follows a grown-up son revisiting his
widowed mother in Montana and trying to come to terms with
her marriage to a former ranch hand. The last story, "Mary in
the Mountains," explores the mental landscape of a quietly
unusual woman as she ruminates -- without blame or bitterness
-- on her fate as an abandoned wife. These stories prove that
there's still life in the agrarian literary tradition,
particularly when a writer knows where to look for it.
   Steven Millhauser's new collection, "The Barnum Museum"
(Poseidon, 208 pages, $18.95), sets out to be a colorful,
wildly inventive melange of meta-fictional fictions, rife
with literary allusions and the kind of playful artifice
popularized by Donald Barthelme. But like a deck of playing
cards, this set of 10 stories turns out to be less colorful,
more predetermined, than promised. Typical is "A Game of
Clue," a rather strained confection that juxtaposes the
relations among some real people playing that board game with
the imaginary affairs of the characters depicted in the game:
Miss Scarlet, Colonel Mustard et al. Neither group is
particularly engaging. In "Behind the Blue Curtain," a boy
manages to penetrate the mysterious world beyond the
movie-theater screen. Again, it's less intriguing than it
should be. "Klassic Komix 1" is, despite its early number, a
rather tired literary joke: cutely described frames from a
comic book illustrating "The Love Song of J. Alfred
Prufrock."
   Other stories are more successful, taken on their own
terms, as bravura feats of the author's visual imagination.
The title story tours a museum of artifice, fantasy, a pure
fakery described in splendid detail. "The Invention of Robert
Herendeen" concerns a young man blessed or cursed with such
superfluity of imagination that he invents a fantasy woman,
conceived in such vivid detail as to seem more real than any
reality.
   The Canadian writer Carol Shields, author of story
collections, plays and novels, also is preoccupied with the
shifting balance between imagination and reality. But she
handles her themes with the kind of grace and controlled
lightness that suggest power held wisely in reserve. The 12
stories in "The Orange Fish" (Viking, 199 pages, $17.95)
cover a considerable range of subject matter, from the upbeat
story of "Hazel," a middle-aged widow who astounds her
children and her friends by taking a job demonstrating
kitchen appliances, to the sorrows of Miss Georgia Willow, a
"stern peremptory social arbiter" whose lifelong dedication
to "Good Manners" has involved her in a private life of
hapless sexual compliance.
   Ms. Shields has a gift for describing the odd little
things and experiences that can provoke intense feelings of
joy or happiness but that remain nameless, hard to
categorize, hence, unnoticed in the usual "curriculum vitae".
"Chemistry" is a recollection, some 18 years later, of the
special feeling that once blossomed among the students and
teacher of an adult-education class. "Collision" records a
chance encounter in an East European country between a man
and woman who do no more than share an umbrella in the rain.
In the title story, a depressed couple "deep in their
thirties" purchase a handsome lithograph of an orange fish
that subtly improves their lives. What happens when this
life-enhancing work of art becomes a commercialized,
mass-market product? Ms. Shields is the kind of writer who
can answer such a question, wittily, poignantly and ruefully.

potential problems. Moody's and other rating firms already
have reduced their opinion of other money center banks' debt

   Hunt Manufacturing
   Reports 48% Decline

   PHILADELPHIA -- Hunt Manufacturing Co. said second-quarter
net income plunged 48% from a year ago, reflecting a general
softness in sales and special problems with a recent
acquisition.
   Second-quarter net fell to $2.5 million, or 15 cents a
share, from $4.8 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. Sales
in the latest quarter rose 5.6% to about $50.7 million from
$48 million a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hunt, a maker and distributor of office products and art
and craft products, blamed most of the decline on a decrease
of about 10% in sales of several major product lines and on
major losses incurred by the Data Products business, acquired
last June.
   In addition, a company official cited some start-up
problems in Hunt's new operation in Mexico that have hampered
performance.
   Trading of Hunt shares was delayed yesterday morning while
the company disseminated the earnings news. Hunt shares
closed at $13.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, down $2.
   For the latest six months, Hunt reported that net income
dropped 26% to $6.4 million, or 40 cents a share, from $8.7
million, or 54 cents, despite a 5.5% increase in revenue to
$100.1 million.
   Hunt's chairman and chief executive officer, Ronald J.
Naples, said the magnitude of the earnings drop has "all but
dashed our previous expectation of another record earnings
year," unless the company can manage to make "a remarkable
recovery."
   However, Mr. Naples expressed confidence that sales would
rebound in the second half as more customers replenish
inventories.

   General Foods USA
   To Phase Out a Plant

   HOBOKEN, N.J. -- General Foods USA said it will phase out
operations at its Maxwell House Coffee plant here, a move
affecting 600 workers, by early 1992.
   Raymond G. Viault, president of Maxwell House, said the
plant would be closed to "eliminate a costly excess in
processing capacity," reflecting a 24% decline in coffee
comsumption in the United States since 1963.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., operates four
coffee plants in the U.S., but said only 55% of the capacity
is needed.
   The Hoboken plant, which roasts and grinds coffee, was
built in 1939. Maxwell House also has plants in Jacksonville,
Fla., Houston, and San Leandro, Calif.
   A General Foods spokeswoman said the decision was made to
close the plant because "both short term and long term, our
production costs in Jacksonville were going to be lower than
in Hoboken."
   The plant's operations will be gradually phased out. Mr.
Viault said the company will try to match as many employees
as possible with job openings elsewhere in Maxwell House,
Kraft General Foods and Philip Morris. The company also will
offer training and assistance in job searches.
   Hoboken officials have offered tax cuts, and the union
representing workers at the plant offered other incentives in
efforts to keep the plant open. Some have estimated that up
to 2,500 jobs in the area are dependent upon the plant.
Neither Hoboken nor union officials could be reached for
comment.
   After several years of disappointing results, Kraft
General Foods's Maxwell House brand of coffee has gained
strength recently, according to food industry analysts. With
34.5% of the domestic market for ground roast coffee, the
brand is locked in a fierce competition for the industry's
No. 1 slot with Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s Folger's brand.
   Michael Miles, chief executive of Kraft General Foods,
attributed the improvement to the introduction of new coffee
blends and increased ad spending.

used to retire existing debt.
   Jerome de Bontin, a managing director of Rodman &amp; Renshaw

   LONDON -- Delegates to an international government
conference agreed on most details for creation of a $160
million global fund to protect the world's ozone layer.
   The fund, to be managed by the World Bank and two United
Nations agencies, will help developing nations start
converting their industries to ozone-friendly technologies.
As the first large fund targeted at a specific global
environmental ill, the fund may become a model for how the
world will finance such other problems as the threat of
global warming and the loss of species.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are establishing a new political mechanism to deal
with the environmental crisis," said Mostafa Tolba, executive
director of the United Nations Environment Program.
   The fund will pay the first three years of developing
countries' efforts to phase out use of chlorofluorocarbons,
or CFCs, halons and carbon tetrachloride -- all man-made
chemicals, used in refrigerators, air conditioners, spray
cans and factories -- which eat away the atmosphere's
protective layer of ozone gas. The developed nations, which
represent 85% of world consumption of these chemicals, are
expected to agree here tomorrow to ban usage by either 1997
or 2000. The world's developing nations will have an extra
decade to ban the substances, but say they will still need
financial help from the fund to adopt ozone-friendly
substitutes.

   Top-Line Thinking at the NEA
   ----
   By Arthur Levitt Jr.
</HL>
<DATE>
06/28/90
</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14
</SO>
<LP>
   In the heat of the controversy surrounding the National
Endowment for the Arts, let me suggest that some interesting
and important economic issues are being overlooked. As a
confirmed capitalist, I am struck by the notion that the arts
-- especially the National Endowment for the Arts -- offer
useful lessons for business.
   Those U.S. corporations that are losing the battle for
global competitiveness today have a few things in common:
short-term focus, bottom-line-only decision making, avoidance
of long-range commitments like research and development, and
fear of risk-taking. Such an approach cripples the
competitive abilities of these companies far more than
foreign trade barriers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On the other hand, those companies that have performed the
best in today's fiercely competitive environment are
comfortable with risks and tend to spend more on R&amp;D. These
successful companies have something in common with the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   Even a cursory glance at the NEA's history shows that it
is driven by top-line thinking: Quality comes first. It is
what endures in art and what artists strive for above all
else.
   This benchmark has directed NEA support to an enviable
list of artists and arts organizations that begins with the
American Ballet Theater -- the NEA's first grant recipient,
and extends to John Irving, who wrote "The World According to
Garp" with a NEA Literature Fellowship. There are also grants
to Alice Walker, Billy Taylor, Alvin Ailey, Twyla Tharp, the
St. Louis Symphony, the Houston Opera, Nam June Paik, and
even the Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nev., to name just
a few of the 85,000 grantees that have caught my eye.
   Next, the NEA has made certain it provided support for
research and development. It is no accident that all four
Pulitzer Prize winners this year received NEA funds at
important junctures in their careers: Mel Powell for music,
Oscar Hijuelos for fiction, Charles Simic for poetry and
August Wilson for playwriting. In fact, every Pulitzer
Prize-winning play since 1976 received its premiere
production at a nonprofit theater, with NEA support.
   Finally, the NEA has not shied away from risk-taking or
from experimentation. The Dance Theater of Harlem, first
funded through a category called "expansion arts," went on to
achieve national and international acclaim. The Vietnam War
Memorial, today one of the most visited monuments in
Washington, resulted from an NEA design competition that
initially received a significant amount of controversy.
Likewise, the Calder sculpture in Grand Rapids, Mich., was
criticized in its early years but has endured and become a
symbol of civic pride.
   Has the NEA funded artists or arts organizations whose
work was disappointing? Definitely. Its judgments can be and
have been flawed. Sometimes the bet was placed and was lost.
   The same is true of science. For every scientific
experiment that leads to a cure or a spacecraft launched,
there are hundreds, thousands that fizzle, misfire or go up
in smoke. Our government continues to support the efforts of
our scientists through the National Science Foundation,
precisely because we don't know what the outcome will be. It
is through the courage to fail that we achieve eventual
success -- in science, in art, in business.
   There is yet one more point here for business: The arts
and economic vitality appear to be linked in powerful ways.
Almost without exception, the best places for locating
businesses, for job growth, for commercial viability, are
those communities that support their cultural institutions.
   In less than 25 years, the NEA has become an integral part
of not only our cultural life but also our economic vitality.
Along the way, it has exhibited the courage and the vision to
take some risks. And even after tremendous buffeting this
past year, the NEA has remained clear about the true value of
artists to our society.
   Like the Hubble telescope, developed and launched for no
reason more specific than a desire to see and explore, our
artists should be nurtured and their careers launched for no
reason more specific than their need to express, to discover
their individual voices . . . and for our need to hear and
see what they have to show us.
   And just as the Hubble telescope promises to send back new
ways of looking at the universe beyond us, so will our
artists continue to delight, inspire, amuse, infuriate, awe
and sometimes even offend us with new ways of looking at the
world we live in.
   That is top-line thinking. It is a vision worthy of the
support by our nation's leaders in government and in
business.

   Metro Airlines to Post
   Fourth-Quarter Loss
   But Sees Profit Ahead

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   DALLAS -- Metro Airlines Inc. will post a fourth-quarter
loss of $4 million to $4.5 million, or 70 cents a share, but
is projecting a profitable first and second quarters of the
current fiscal year, J.L. Seaborn, president and chief
operating officer, said.
   The loss in the three months ended April 30 was less than
half Metro's year-earlier fourth-quarter deficit of $9.2
million, or $1.54 a share, which was caused primarily by a
strike and bankruptcy filing at Eastern Airlines. Metro
operates feeder carriers affiliated with several airlines,
including Eastern in Atlanta.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Metro expects to report fourth-quarter revenue of about
$55 million, up from $34.4 million a year earlier, Mr.
Seaborn said in an interview.
   For the full fiscal year, revenue was about $195 million,
up from $147.5 million. Full-year net losses were about $19
million, or $3.20 a share, he said, compared with a
year-earlier loss of $10.7 million, or $1.83 a share, before
an accounting change.
   In the current quarter, operations are showing sharp
improvement, Mr. Seaborn said. "Revenues are at an all-time
high," he said, reflecting a turnaround in Atlanta and an
improvement in Metro's Northeast operations. He didn't offer
specific projections for revenue or net income for this
quarter or next.
   Mr. Seaborn said Metro showed a profit for May and June,
the first two months of its current fiscal year, now that
Eastern is operating 288 flights a day in the Atlanta market.
This month, he said, Metro will carry about 80,000 passengers
in and out of Atlanta, topping its previous one-month high
there of 66,000 passengers, when Eastern was at full
strength.
   Although Atlanta operations represent only a quarter of
Metro's flights, about 80% of those connect with Eastern. Mr.
Seaborn said Eastern's troubles were a primary cause of
Metro's heavy losses over the last fiscal year.
   Traffic also began to pick up in the fourth quarter on
Metro Air Northeast, and the division posted a profit in May,
said Brian Miller, Metro's chief financial officer.
   Metro Northeast feeds passengers into the Trans World
Airlines Inc. network. The division, formerly Brockway Air
Inc., was purchased by Metro in 1989. Last July, Metro
changed the unit's name and switched its affiliation to TWA
from Piedmont Airlines. The changes caused traffic to drop
temporarily and contributed to Metro's losses during the
just-concluded year.
   In addition to its operations with Eastern in Atlanta,
Metro operates as a feeder carrier for American Airlines in
Dallas/ Fort Worth. Mr. Seaborn said Metro's there have been
stable and profitable.

   ASHLAND, Ky. -- Ashland Oil Inc. said its exploration unit
has completed the $107 million purchase of natural gas
properties from a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp., New
York.
   Ashland said the acquisition includes about 550,000 acres
of natural gas producing and undeveloped properties in West
Virginia and Eastern Kentucky. Nearly 700 producing wells on
the properties average about 18 million cubic feet of natural
gas per day, the company said, adding that total proved
reserves could total 142 billion cubic feet.

   The acquisition will more than double Ashland's existing
Appalachian acreage and increase the company's total natural
gas production by over 30%, the company said.

   Midwest Banks Boost Loan Reserves
   Amid Growing Real Estate Problems

   Midwest banks are bracing for a wave of problem real
estate loans.
   From Pittsburgh to Minneapolis, Midwest banks have more
shaky loans for offices, hotels, shopping centers and
apartment buildings than they've had in decades. And though
the credit troubles so far appear less serious than those
experienced by Northeast banks, Midwest lenders are making
sizable additions to loan-loss reserves. They also are
tightening up lending standards, putting a crimp in new
construction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There's no question there are widespread financial
problems in real estate," says Norman Robertson, chief
economist at Mellon Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh, who counts the
Midwest as a problem region.
   Many Midwest bankers say the big charges have already been
taken, but some observers think they are too optimistic.
"It's becoming clear that the problem is much worse and much
more universal than people thought a year ago," says A. Gary
Shilling, a New York economic consultant. "History suggests
that bankers seldom get the entire cancer out on the first
trip to the operating room."
   Investors share his concern. The price of many Midwestern
bank stocks are scraping bottom as investors anticipate
further problems. Common shares of Pittsburgh's PNC Financial
Corp., for instance, hit a low of $29.50 on Monday, 40% below
the 52-week high. AmeriTrust Corp. stock also is down 40%
from the Cleveland bank's 52-week high.
   PNC, one of the largest Midwest regional bank holding
companies, added $108.9 million to its loan-loss reserves in
the first quarter, about three times the amount normally set
aside for potential loan losses. And PNC officials project a
$65 million to $75 million provision for the current quarter.
The extra provisions cover problem real estate loans PNC made
in the East and Southeast, specifically in Philadelphia and
New York and in Georgia and Florida, officials say. Midwest
real estate loans haven't presented unusual problems so far,
PNC says.
   AmeriTrust reported a first-quarter loss because it was
forced to downgrade $140 million of loans that officials
still expect to be repaid on time. Following the downgrades,
the bank boosted loan-loss reserves to $219.3 million, or
2.64% of total loans and leases, from $110.2 million, or
1.34% at the end of last year.
   Those actions result from "a more stringent view of all
real estate loans" by bank regulators, rather than a
deterioration of AmeriTrust's loan portfolio, says James W.
Otto, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
The bank made an addition to loss reserves greater than was
required to cover loan downgrades, he says, because officials
wanted to be sure they don't take a second hit later.
   Meanwhile, industry sources say regulators are examining
loans at Mellon this week. While such examinations are a
regular practice, this year they have frequently resulted in
downgrading of some loans. Mellon says as a matter of policy
it doesn't comment on regulatory matters.
   Equimark Corp., another Pittsburgh bank holding company,
said yesterday it will lose between $12 million and $17
million in the second quarter, stemming in part from bad real
estate loans. The price of Equimark shares has been more than
halved in the last year, reflecting its deteriorating credit
quality.
   Even Banc One Corp., generally regarded as one of the
best-managed banks in the nation, expects more troubles
ahead. The Columbus, Ohio, lender said in a recent Securities
and Exchange Commission filing that its nonperforming loans
could rise by as much as $70 million, or 25%, in the second
quarter.
   Some bankers contend the Midwest region isn't the problem
per se: the underlying economy is more stable than in much of
the U.S. right now, and both lenders and builders were more
cautious than in other regions. Instead, many problem loans
now surfacing at Midwest banks are tied to real estate
projects in the Northeast or Southwest.
   Still, the Midwest commercial real estate market looks
healthy only by comparison. About 23% of top-quality office
space in Indianapolis is vacant, for instance, commonly
leading to discounts of 35% as developers scramble for
tenants. Cleveland's vacancy rate, meanwhile, probably will
almost double by 1994. Overbuilding of offices, retail space,
hotels and apartments in the Minneapolis area has led to a
sizable drop in effective rental rates, says David G. Hansen,
senior vice president, First National Bank, a unit of First
Bank System Inc., Minneapolis. As a result, his bank has
drastically curtailed commercial construction lending.
   Overbuilding in the region could prove a big problem if
there's a lengthy recession. And even without a recession,
Midwest bank earnings won't be robust for at least a year or
two. Besides the higher loan-loss provisions, some bankers
admit that they're turning down loans they would have made a
year ago. Fewer loans mean lower profits.

   All Parties Lose After Bush Tax Switch

EXECUTIVE (EXE)

<LP>
   George Shultz once observed that "trust is the coin of the
realm." In Washington over the past several decades, that
coin has lost substantial value. George Bush's decision to
wedge the door open on tax increases could reduce the coin's
value further, diminishing trust in him, in Republicans, and
in Democrats generally.
   On first glance, pollsters' findings on American attitudes
to taxes seem to be wildly contradictory. In one recent poll,
for example, 71% of Americans said government spending should
be frozen. In another, more than six in 10 said more money
should be spent on domestic programs. Some contradictions
reflect longstanding ambivalence about taxes and services.
Others reflect vague choices presented to respondents. Still
others reflect low levels of public knowledge -- in areas
such as capital-gains taxes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is worthwhile to take a moment to sort through the
contradictions, because there are some powerful currents in
this river of data. First, Americans want a lot from
government. We are a rich and powerful country, and want
government to do many things. We recognize these cost money.
But we believe that the price we are paying for government
services is too great and that our taxes are excessively
high. This is true nationally, and in states from California
to Massachusetts.
   To cite only two recent polls: in Connecticut, 70% said
the level of state taxes was "too high"; in Illinois, a solid
majority felt that the 1989 individual and corporate income
tax increase should be repealed. California's Prop 111
doubled the state's low gas tax to pay for infrastructure.
But citizens' 52%-to-48% passage of the proposition does not
represent a fundamental re-evaluation of taxes. A designated
tax to remedy a specific problem is generally more acceptable
than a general one that feeds government's appetite.
Politicians cannot go to this "designated tax" well too
often, lest already low public confidence diminish.
   The "hold the line" mood on taxes is shared by Americans
across the board. Their attitudes stem from the view that
government doesn't spend wisely. In a recent ABC
News/Washington Post poll, Americans said that nearly half of
each dollar -- 46 cents -- that government collects in taxes
is wasted. In Massachusetts, respondents told KRC/Boston
Globe pollsters that they disagreed with Michael Dukakis when
he said state taxes needed to be raised because all spending
cuts that could be made had been made.
   Why, then, do majorities say that they want to spend more
money -- and taxes -- on a whole variety of programs? First,
genuine concern about the less fortunate exists and so, too,
does concern about problem areas such as crime, drugs and
education. But spending questions are rarely asked
cumulatively, so we have no realistic idea of how much
Americans feel they can bear. A question asked in isolation
produces a generous response; a series of questions adding up
the costs produces a more cautious one. In an innovative
effort to remedy this polling deficiency, researchers at the
Public Agenda Foundation conducted three-hour interviews with
545 Americans about six social welfare programs.
Significantly, only a minority of Americans showed
willingness to pay more than $25 a year for any of the
programs surveyed (each costing from about $25 to $120 per
person per year).
   Voters are telling leaders to do more -- but not
necessarily to spend more. ABC News/Washington Post polling
showed a drop this spring in support for spending on the
homeless -- even though neither the plight of the homeless
nor Americans' desire to help had changed.
   There are several lessons here for politicians. Both
Democrats and Republicans have much to gain by holding the
line on taxes, but the nature of the gain is different. Today
the country is at rough parity in party identification -- in
1980, more Americans were Democrats, but, as the decade
passed, many switched to the Republican Party for economic
reasons. In 1980, the GOP led the Democrats as the party
Americans saw as better able to control government spending
by a stunning 56 percentage points (72% to 16%) in Wirthlin
Group data. The gap has narrowed to eight points, and could
narrow more. Democrats are seen as "too quick to support tax
increases" by 56% of Americans and 45% of Democrats, in a
Time/Yankelovich poll. Democrats need to dispel that image.
   George Bush may not suffer in opinion polls immediately.
Nor is it likely that many representatives will lose seats
this year as a result of a tax switch -- the voter tendency
to re-elect incumbents is too strong. But more visible Senate
or gubernatorial candidates might be affected. For both
parties, the long-term consequences are serious.
   Another potential consequence of a tax increase is a
further erosion of trust in government. The link between
taxes and trust is hard to define. But for nearly two
decades, polls have told us that Americans believe their
leaders in Washington aren't performing well. In the 1988
campaign, Americans told pollsters that they would be more
worried about a politician who goes too far in increasing
government's role (52%) than about one who goes too far in
cutting back (37%). When George Bush took office, only 24% of
Americans said he could "avoid raising taxes." By this
February, 54% said he could. That was the largest gain in
this Gallup Poll series -- 30 percentage points. Mr. Bush was
making good on a promise -- something that doesn't happen
very often in Washington. Now he may be breaking it.
   Politicians err when they ignore this trust. Even if
Americans rarely see a price tag, they know intuitively that
they will pay for new spending. Only 9% in a Gallup poll felt
the government would be able to reduce its spending. They are
generous, but they simply can't afford to be as generous as
politicians think they should be. What politicians need to
say is that we have a big government and want a big
government, but that right now the size and cost should get
no bigger.

   Dystrophy Treatment Passes Safety Test
   ----

   The first potential treatment for muscular dystrophy
passed early safety tests and offered a glimpse of the kind
of payoffs that might come from mapping the 50,000 to 100,000
genes in the human genome. The effectiveness of the
treatment, however, isn't known.
   Neurologists in Montreal said that doses of normal muscle
cells had been safely and successfully injected into a single
afflicted arm muscle of each of three boys with muscular
dystrophy. Seven other boys will receive the experimental
treatment in coming months. All the boys are aged six to
eight years and are suffering the early stages of muscular
dystrophy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The injected normal cells, it is hoped, will supply a
muscle protein, the lack of which is the cause of the
relentless deterioration of the muscles that is the hallmark
of muscular dystrophy.
   It will be several months before the Canadian researchers
can determine whether the injected muscle cells will produce
the protein and whether the protein will stop or reverse the
steady weakening of the surrounding muscle. Effectiveness
will be judged by comparing, in each boy, the strength of the
biceps in the treated arm with the strength of the biceps in
the opposing arm which received only injections of salt
water.
   "For the first time in a large muscle, we've determined
that the procedure is feasible as well as safe," neurologist
George Karpati of the Montreal Neurological Institute
reported on behalf of a team involving scientists from five
Canadian medical institutions.
   In a telephone interview, Dr. Karpati said many
researchers had been skeptical that the experiment could be
done. The Canadian team, he explained, had now shown that it
is possible to take a few immature muscle cells and culture
them in the test tube to produce millions of copies. Each boy
received up to 55 injections of one million copies each of
his father's myoblasts, which are immature muscle cells.
   The first three boys receiving the injections also showed
that the procedure was free of the adverse effects that some
researchers had feared, Dr. Karpati said.
   The Montreal announcement differs from a similar report
made early this month by researchers at the University of
Tennessee in that it involves a much larger muscle. The
Tennessee scientists injected normal muscle cells into a
small foot muscle of eight boys with the disorder. The
treated muscle controls the big toe; the first of the eight
boys to be treated has experienced a slight increase in
strength of the treated toe, the researchers reported.
   The technique, technically known as myoblast transfer,
also will be tried this summer by research teams in Boston
and San Francisco.
   The unprecedented advance against muscular dystrophy now
under way is giving impetus to the organized effort to locate
and identify all 50,000 to 100,000 human genes, an effort
known as the human genome project. Scientists say muscular
dystrophy is the first and most dramatic example of how gene
mapping can lead to the conquest of a genetic disease.
   Although muscular dystrophy was first recognized as a
distinct disorder in the 1870s, its cause baffled scientists
for more than a century. They knew only that it was caused by
a defective gene that was inherited from the mother and that
it showed up almost exclusively in boys.
   In the early 1980s, new techniques for locating and
identifying, or "mapping," unknown genes began to emerge from
biology laboratories. In the summer of 1983, the Muscular
Dystrophy Association, which is best known for its annual
Jerry Lewis Telethon, picked three teams of scientists to use
the new gene-mapping techniques for a $5 million crash search
for the muscular dystrophy gene.
   In the fall of 1986, the team at Boston's Children's
Hospital, led by molecular geneticist Louis Kunkel, found the
muscular dystrophy gene, edging out by only a few months a
competing team at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
Within a year, the Boston researchers found that the normal
version of the defective muscular dystrophy gene produced a
protein that they dubbed dystrophin.
   It was quickly discovered that boys suffering the most
common and severest form of the disease, Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, completely lacked dystrophin, while those with a
milder form, Becker muscular dystrophy, had defective
versions of the protein.
   What dystrophin normally does in muscle tissues and how
its lack leads to the muscle deterioration seen in muscular
dystrophy isn't known. But dystrophin's clear link to the
disease led to the current experiments to see if
transplanting normal dystrophin-producing muscle cells will
prevent the deterioration of particular muscles in afflicted
boys.
   If the transplanted cells "take" and their dystrophin does
in fact stem the destruction of the surrounding bicep muscle,
researchers would still have to figure out how to treat the
entire patient rather than a single muscle. "The next phase
would be to go on and try to inject multiple muscles,"
particularly the muscles involved in breathing, walking and
arm movements, Dr. Karpati said.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Art Crime Update:
   Easter Heist of Antiquities From Ancient Corinth

   Just before Easter, as people all over Greece headed to
their home villages or the seashore, jamming roadways, ports
and airports, thieves broke into the Archaeological Museum of
Ancient Corinth. Around 3 a.m., several persons attacked the
solitary 62-year-old night watchman and left him beaten,
bound and gagged. Before the day shift arrived to discover
the crime, the thieves had removed 271 objects -- many works
of Ancient Corinthian pottery; other ceramic works ranging
from the Geometric period to Attic black-figured and
red-figured vases, glass vases and sculpture, including a a
male Kourostype head from about 470 B.C.; and works dating
from Corinth's Roman period. Along with the antiquities, the
burglars took one million drachmas (about $6,100) in cash,
representing two weeks of staff wages and entrance fees from
foreign visitors.
   The thieves used a ladder purchased locally to reach the
museum's roof and descend into the courtyard. Having gathered
their loot, the gang tried without success to exit through
the heavy metal front door. They abandoned their tools,
climbed back up the ladder and then left it behind, covered
with fingerprints.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   From his hospital bed, the guard said two of the men wore
hoods, that they spoke Greek and used walkie-talkies to
communicate with unseen accomplices. Authorities were
immediately notified, border guards alerted, and a huge
nationwide search for the perpetrators began.
   The theft is believed to be the largest ever of Greek
antiquities, and the Greek press suggests that plunderers of
archaeological sites recently have added museums to their hit
lists. Very few thefts from Greece are reported to Interpol
or to the International Foundation for Art Research, but
following the Corinth theft, Greek newspapers reported that
an alarming number of incidents, 231, occurred in the last
six months alone. The most important was a robbery in
November 1989 at the Archaeological Museum housed in the
Hospital of the Knights in Rhodes, where thieves also
disabled a night watchman and entered via the roof. Their
booty consisted largely of Mycenaean gold and jewelry.
   Although connoisseurs might dismiss many of the Corinth
items as of only mediocre artistic quality, the theft is a
terrible loss to archaeology. The excavations at Ancient
Corinth have operated continuously since 1896 under the aegis
of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. The
school is the largest of the foreign archaeological
institutes in Greece, and since its founding in 1881 it has
been a home for students and faculty from 153 North American
colleges and universities who have used its libraries and
participated in its excavations. Excavations have unearthed a
Greek agora, a temple to Apollo, fountains and, from Roman
times, several small temples and a large amphitheater. The
American School built the museum in 1931 and enlarged it in
1958, but the collections and the museum and its contents are
the property of the Greek government.
   The Ministry of Culture, under its newly appointed head,
Tzannis Tzannetakis, issued a statement pledging to reinforce
museum security. As a rule, smaller museums in Greece have
few security guards during hours of opening and just one
watchman at night; electronic alarm systems are rare.
Skeptics have been quick to challenge the ministry to
activate those alarm systems that do exist to test which ones
would actually work and to see whether the police would
respond.
   The objects stolen at Corinth all were excavated and
studied, and many have been included in scholarly
publications, including the school's journal, Hesperia.
Should they be recovered, identification will not be a
problem since all the objects were photographed and properly
recorded, and each piece is marked indelibly to identify it.
   The city of Ancient Corinth, slightly inland from the
modern center, dates from Homeric times and became a maritime
power as early as the seventh century B.C. Early painted
pottery from Corinth was popular and has been found
throughout the Mediterranean. The city's artists also were
known for their bronzes, but most of them were melted down,
especially after Corinth was sacked in 146 B.C. by a Roman
army under Gen. Achaicus Lucius Mummius. Julius Caesar
restored the city about a century later.
   Corinth also was notorious as a city of pleasure, a sort
of ancient Las Vegas famed for its prostitutes and other
costly diversions. On the cliff above the ancient city,
archaeologists have excavated the remains of a temple to
Aphrodite, the goddess of love. Aristophanes is credited with
coining the verb "to Corinth," meaning to prostitute oneself.
Even in the 16th century, when Hans Holbein the Younger
painted a portrait of his mistress, Magdalena Offenburg, he
depicted her as a courtesan, "Lais of Corinth."

   NEW YORK -- The U.S. Health and Human Services Department
improperly rejected thousands of heart-disease patients who
applied for disability benefits, a federal appeals court
ruled.
   The decision will require the department to reconsider the
applications of at least 150,000 New York state residents,

brought the case. Although it applies only to New York
residents, the decision could be used to challenge the

   The court in Manhattan ruled that since 1980, the
department has unfairly relied on treadmill tests to
determine whether heart-disease patients were disabled.
   "The treadmill test, while recommended by many medical
experts as a good diagnostic tool, results in misdiagnosis of
ischemic heart disease on more than one-third of the
occasions," the appeals court said. Ischemic heart disease,
caused by the narrowing of the arteries, is the most common
heart ailment. "An individual who doesn't show signs of heart
disease during the treadmill test may still be severely
disabled from ischemia," the court said.
   HHS has great leeway in deciding how benefits are granted,
but it overstepped its authority in using only the treadmill
test to evaluate heart-disease patients, the court said.
Instead of solely relying on the treadmill test, the agency
should also consider doctors' evaluations, angiograph
readings and other tests that give a more complete picture of
whether the patient is disabled by the disease, the court
said.
   "As a result of this decision, the federal government will
no longer be able to cruelly deny justly deserved benefits to
thousands of vulnerable disabled people," said New York
Attorney General Robert Abrams in a statement. "The policy
was just another example of the Reagan administration's
efforts to balance the budget on the backs of the weakest in
our society."
   The decision will also require the U.S. to pick up the tab
for millions of dollars in disability benefits that New York
state has been paying, Mr. Abrams's office said. New York
estimates that it pays $8 million annually in such benefits,
and that the U.S. owes it $50 million for payments made since
1980.
   Diogenes Kekatos, an assistant U.S. Attorney who
represented HHS, said no decision has been made on whether to
appeal the decision.
   David Udell, an attorney with Legal Services for the
Elderly in New York, said the case was the first class-action
to challenge the agency's reliance on the treadmill test. He
said the decision is likely to be used in challenging the
agency's policy in other states as well.

   Mobil Formally Settles Trash-Bag Suit
   In Texas by Halting Claim, Paying Fine

   Mobil Corp. formally agreed to withdraw all environmental
claims for Hefty trash bags sold in Texas under a settlement
with one of seven states that recently sued for alleged false
advertising.
   Texas and six other states sued Mobil Chemical Co., a unit
of New York-based Mobil, earlier this month for claiming that
Hefty bags are "degradable" even after burial in landfills.
The states contend the labeling is deceptive because Mobil
has admitted the bags don't degrade rapidly enough to extend
the life of municipal landfills.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mobil voluntarily agreed last March to withdraw all
environmental claims, but that pledge wasn't legally binding.
Now, under the settlement, Mobil agreed to make no
environmental claims for its Hefty and Kordite bag lines sold
in Texas for three years and to pay the state $15,000. After
three years, Mobil will be able to make environmental claims
only if fully substantiated.
   Texas officials have also requested the state's largest
retail chains to display a "prominent" sign in aisles where
Hefty products are sold stating: "Plastic bags do not degrade
in landfills. Plastic bags that claim to be `degradable' are
no better for the environment than any other bags." However,
Mobil is allowed to sell its remaining inventory, which could
last until the end of this year.
   Texas Assistant Attorney General Stephen Gardner said he
hopes the settlement could provide a model for agreements in
other states.
   Mobil Chemical spokesman Allen Gray said the company
"fully substantiated" the degradability claim and never
deceived consumers. However, the company told retailers it
agreed to settle the case to avoid further controversy that
could "add to consumers' misconceptions."
   Mr. Gray said the settlement was merely putting the
company's voluntary agreement in writing.
   Hefty bags with new labels are starting to reach shelves,
Mr. Gray said, adding: "We hope that other bag manufacturers
will voluntarily remove degradability claims until widely
recognized standards for labeling are adopted."
   He said lawsuits in the six other states will be handled
"case by case," but "we would prefer not to litigate."
Lawsuits against Mobil are pending in California, New York,
Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Washington.
   A task force of eight attorneys general is continuing to
investigate a variety of environmental claims by other makers
of plastic bags, disposable diapers and other products.

   I was appalled by Charlotte Low Allen's May 14
editorial-page article, "Ending Abuse of Death Penalty
Appeals." In Mrs. Allen's zeal to shorten the path to the
electric chair, she conveniently overlooks the basic problems
with capital punishment as we now practice it. While
complaining that federal habeas corpus appeals are too
time-consuming, she neglects to mention that one-half of all
state-imposed death sentences have been overturned by federal
courts due to constitutional errors at trial that lower
courts refused to correct. I find troubling the implication
that due process for those accused of terrible crimes is not
worth our time.
   Believing that courts should not address errors "that the
defendant's lawyers did not raise properly," she sees no
inequity in sending a criminal defendant to his death for the
inadequacies of his attorney. It is beyond question that
those who populate death row are poor and were generally
represented by inexperienced lawyers who did not want to take
the unpopular, undercompensated cases. One of the last
executions in Alabama was of a man whose lawyer did not even
bother to appeal his flawed death sentence to the state
appellate court. There have been many instances of
co-defendants on death row, one of whose lawyers raised a
constitutional violation and won a new, fair trial for his
client, while the other failed to raise the very same issue
and sent his client to the executioner. Is this evenhanded
justice? If Mrs. Allen is so anxious for the process to
proceed more quickly, I wonder that she is not more concerned
with providing adequate representation for these people in
the first instance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1974
because it found that it was no longer applied in an
arbitrary fashion. Yet what could be more arbitrary than the
recent decision in Teague v. Lane, which held that whether a
prisoner can get relief from an unconstitutionally imposed
death sentence depends on the date his state-court appeals
ended. Thus, of two prisoners whose juries were selected in
the same racially discriminatory manner or whose judges gave
exactly the same improper jury instruction, one may be
executed and one granted a new trial.
   Mrs. Allen also objects to a proposed reform measure out
of a misguided notion that it would "bring racial quotas to
state death penalty laws. . . ." My understanding of the
Racial Justice Act is that it would forestall an execution
only where a prisoner presented concrete evidence that his
sentence was obtained due to racial bias, and that the state
could then rebut that evidence. I for one would not be
comfortable saying an execution should proceed in the face of
undisputed evidence of racism.
   Mrs. Allen's article appears based more on a need for
quick vengeance than careful administration of the laws. No
matter how ugly or distressing the crime, everyone deserves a
truly fair trial: Our Constitution and our consciences demand
no less.

   ---
   What will be accomplished by killing prisoners quickly?
Why the urgency? Why should their appeals be limited, when
others' appeals have no limits? Are appeals for life worth
less than other crimes or civil offenses? Are the judicial
systems of our states, particularly in the South, of such
high quality that federal oversight through habeas corpus
petitions can be decreased?
   My eight years' study of death-sentencing, particularly in
Virginia, has shown me that it is stacked in favor of
prosecutors. They decide without any regulation or controls
who will be charged with a capital offense. Their decisions
are mainly motivated by political interests. They select
poor, chiefly minority and most often mentally deficient
people. These defendants are given untrained court-appointed
attorneys of questionable skills who in turn are given a few
hundred dollars to conduct a defense against prosecutors with
considerable resources. (Surveys of death-row prisoners show
that they all had court-appointed attorneys.) Only jurors who
believe in killing prisoners are allowed in both the guilt
and sentencing parts of capital trials.
   Class prejudice also can be added to the unfairness in
death-sentencing. Former Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas said: "One searches in vain for the execution of any
member of the affluent strata of our society." Former Gov.
Michael DiSall of Ohio once said: "During my experience as
governor . . . I found the men on death row had one thing in
common: They were penniless. The fact that they had no money
was a principal factor in their being condemned to death."
   And then there is race prejudice. The General Accounting
Office issued a report in March that concluded there are
"racial disparities in the charging, sentencing, and
imposition of the death penalty." It also found that those
who kill whites were more likely to be sentenced to death
than those who murder blacks. Last year, the Rehnquist court
held that racial prejudice was "an inevitable part of the
criminal-justice process."
   Mrs. Allen's commentary failed to present any part of this
dark side of the death-sentencing process. She also had some
faulty comments. She leads us to think that because Robert
Alton Harris's wife testified against him that he must be
worthy of his death sentence ("Suffice it to say. . . .").
Also, she leads us to conclude that because a probation
officer attributed Mr. Harris's 1971 abnormal EEG to
glue-sniffing, then this must be the explanation for this
medical finding.
   Given these limitations, defects and prejudices of the
judicial process, why the mindless rush to kill a few poor,
and most often emotionally unstable, prisoners who were not
adequately defended in the first place? More important, why
the moral and ethical blindness to the inhumanness, cruelty,
hatred and malevolence that are at the core of this savagery?
Why the coldbloodedness of mind and heart? Why can't our
judicial and other community leaders teach us about goodness,
the value of human life, and that working to end pain and
suffering is more important than working for violence and
death?

   LOW-INCOME HOUSING finds growing favor with U.S. banks.
   "Wanting to grab the initiative from regulators, America's
major banks have moved to embrace the cause of housing for
the poor," says Craig Smith of the Corporate Philanthropy
Report. Strengthened enforcement of the Community
Reinvestment Act is one reason, but banks also like the low
lending risk created by teaming up with government and
foundation money, says Boston-based consultant James Carras.
"It complies with the federal statute, you can make money and
you look good."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trend is evident both in bank lending and bank
philanthropy. Chase Manhattan Bank this year adopted a policy
that local contributions committees give no less than 25% of
their money to housing or homeless programs. Bank lending
consortiums are also on the rise. The Massachusetts Housing
Investment Corporation is expected to begin formal operations
next week, with $200 million for loans and equity
investments.
   The National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders,
incorporated last year, already has 100 members and plans a
data base this fall.
                                                                                                       

   SUPERMARKET SHOPPING no longer requires going to the
store.
   Now that one-stop shopping has arrived, some supermarkets
are finding ways to eliminate the stop altogether. Vons Cos.
Inc. installed a drive-up window at its Pasadena, Calif.,
store in March, offering shoppers a chance to buy convenience
items without ever leaving the car. "A lot of elderly are
using it," says Phil Hawkins, vice president. "They just
don't like to have to walk around a supermarket." Vons is now
scouting for other drive-up locations.
   Shoppers Express Inc., Bethesda, Md., markets toll-free
ordering and local grocery-delivery service to supermarket
chains. The cost to consumers: $9.95 to $12.50 an order. The
company claims participating stores in "just about every
market in the country." Safeway Inc. says the service tested
so well that it has been expanded throughout the Washington,
D.C., area. "It's very popular among mothers with new
infants," says Safeway's Jim Roberts. Kroger Co. tests
computerized shopping and home delivery through the Prodigy
system in Atlanta.
                                                                                                       

   R&amp;D GROWTH SLOWS as more companies take a shorter-term
view.
   The top 100 spenders in research and development boosted
spending only 8.7% in 1989, compared with 10.7% in 1988, says
Inside R&amp;D newsletter. "The most research-oriented companies
had resisted the trend" seen in small and mid-size companies,
says Charles Joslin, editor. Now the slowdown "is creeping
upward." Still, the 100 stayed well ahead of U.S. firms in
general, which raised spending only 4%. One unexpected area
of growth: big industrial and farm-equipment companies
increased spending 16%.
   Economic jitters and mergers-and-acquisitions activity get
much of the blame. Companies "hold back on R&amp;D so that they
will be somewhat less attractive" targets, says Jules Duga of
Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio. He predicts that
R&amp;D spending will continue to trend downwards until 1994 or
1995, and actually may shrink before increasing again.
   Declines in defense spending may not hurt
government-sponsored R&amp;D, Duga says, noting advanced systems
and materials still must be developed.
                                                                                                       

   WEARING YOUR COLORS takes on new meaning with a line of
jackets featuring state flags. Made by Bert Newman Inc., the
jackets will sell for about $135 in department stores this
fall. The jacket most in demand so far: Texas, with its Lone
Star flag.
                                                                                                       

   LOOKING EASTWARD: Some 35% of the 1,500 largest U.S. firms
plan to do business in Eastern Europe in the next 12 months,
says the Opinion Research Corp. East Germany was named most
often, followed by the Soviet Union and Poland.
                                                                                                       

   ULCER BREATH? A new technology discovered by General

diabetes and cirrhosis through laser-based breath analysis.
                                                                                                       

   FIREWORKS FIZZLE in some communities as costs keep rising.
   Some towns are taking the bang out of their Fourth of
July. Ridgewood, N.J., did away with its traditional display
this year, blaming a court ruling that moonlighting cops can
be denied disability pay if injured working crowd control.
"We can't hire any off-duty policemen for crowd control,"
says Sue Michaud, deputy village clerk. Nearby Paramus tried
to revive its display -- which died four years ago from suits
and rising prices -- but ran into the same problem. In
Massachusetts, Fire Marshall Joseph O'Keefe says there were
50 fireworks displays around the state a few years ago, but
he's been advised of only 35 this year.
   Other towns say they're not cutting back despite increased
costs. Naperville, Ill., says its Fourth will be as "big as
ever." Boston adds a "magnesium electric storm with silver
rain" to its Charles River display. Marblehead, Mass., which
canceled last year for lack of funds, raised $20,000 in
private donations to fund this year's event.
   Rockford, Ill., says some events have been scaled back,
but only because the holiday falls in midweek.

   The headline on your June 4 editorial was "Stalking
Rosty." In nostalgic reminiscence, President Bush might
suggest another headline: "Voodoo Too."
   In the editorial you advocate the ultimate liberalization
of a federal entitlement program by paying full Social
Security retirement benefits to seniors under 70 who are not
retired. These are people who never paid a nickel into Social
Security without the condition that they meet the act's
definition of retirement before they could receive retirement
benefits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   How do you get the $26 billion to pay for this giveaway?
The same way they got the $1.75 billion to pay for the mainly
upper-bracket income-tax cut and the trillion-dollar net
spending increase during the first Reagan term. Simply dust
off the "laughable" curve, rosy up the assumptions and just
say no to reality.
   Reality and the Social Security actuaries say that
substantial liberalizations of the retirement test in the
past have produced no significant increases in tax receipts
from earnings of Social Security retirees. Reality has also
falsified the rosy assumption that as a consequence of the
Kemp-Roth-Laffer alchemy of 1981, harder work and greater
income-tax collections would balance the budget by 1984.
   You suggest that obeying long-established law that denies
retirement benefits to seniors who are not retired amounts to
an unjust taxation of those seniors. Here we apparently need
a primer on the difference between the apples of government
taxes and the oranges of government benefits. The government
collects the former and pays out the latter. The seniors who
fail the retirement test do not have something taken from
them by taxation. They simply are not given something that is
not owed them. If a car dealership won't give you an
automobile you never paid for, it is not taxing you $10,000.
   Contrary to calculated myth, there is nothing in the
Social Security law that prohibits a senior citizen from
working full time. There is and always has been something in
the Social Security law that prohibits a senior citizen from
working full time and pretending to be retired.
   The retirement test is, in essence, the definition of
part-time work. Not only is that test indexed for wage
inflation, but the federal government has recently
liberalized the test in real dollars and is about to do so
again with my full support and that of Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, whose "limousine," by the way, is as much a
fantasy as the rest of your editorial.
   But to repeal the retirement requirement altogether would
mean that those senior professional and business people who
have already chosen continued six-figure incomes instead of,
say, $12,000 Social Security benefits would suddenly hit a
big Social Security Lotto -- without ever having purchased a
ticket. Whoopee.

   Charter Medical
   Names Developer
   To Hospital Post

   Charter Medical Corp., the troubled psychiatric and
general-hospital chain, named Michael Z. Kay, a hotel
developer, to head its hospital operations.
   Separately, Charter conceded that it had overcharged
Medicare by $900,000. The company said earlier this week that
federal regulators were investigating Charter concerning
possible fraud in its Medicare and Medicaid billings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The hiring of Mr. Kay, 50 years old, underscores Charter's
strategy of marketing its way to higher occupancy rates. Mr.
Kay fills a vacancy created in March when James D. Daher was
fired by Charter's chairman and president, William A.
Fickling, in the midst of a special audit of widespread
accounting irregularities throughout the hospital chain. Mr.
Daher maintained he was unfairly blamed for the problems,
although no reason was given for his dismissal.
   Mr. Kay is currently president and chief operating officer
of the Portman Hotel Co. in Atlanta, a unit of closely held
Portman Cos.
   As executive vice president of hospital operations, Mr.
Kay will be one of a triumvirate of key officers working
under Mr. Fickling, Charter's founder who led a $1.6 billion
leveraged buyout of the company in 1988.
   Mr. Kay hasn't any background in health care. But both he
and Charter pointed to common ground between the hotel and
hospital businesses, particularly in the area of marketing.
   "We're really excited because of his experience in the
operation of hotels and his tremendous marketing skills,"
said J. Rodney Laughlin, executive vice president of human
resources and development.
   Charter and Mr. Kay said the executive will draw on his
skills of selling the company's services to groups as the
industry shifts from obtaining most of its patients from
individuals and doctor referral to obtaining them through
contracts with employers and other groups.
   "Increasingly, hospitals get their business from group
sources such as insurance companies, managed-care companies
and from the government and military," said Mr. Kay, who
assumes his post July 1.
   Mr. Kay was well known to Mr. Fickling because of advisory
services that Portman Hotel Co. has provided to hotels Mr.
Fickling's family controls, Mr. Kay said. Mr. Kay has also
served in the past few months as a marketing consultant to
Charter.
   Mr. Laughlin said Charter is banking on Mr. Kay's skills
in implementing strategic plans "to help us respond to the
changing industry over the next three or four years."
   Charter, which until recently enjoyed almost unbridled
growth, faces serious problems in servicing its debt as the
economic environment for psychiatric hospitals tightens and
insurers and employers push for shorter hospital stays and
other ways to reduce costs. For instance, while hospital
admissions rose 20%, patient days rose only 8% and expenses
soared 26% in the quarter ended March 31.
   In addressing the Medicare probe, Charter said it
discovered certain hospital cost reports filed with Medicare
were incorrect and resulted in a request for "about $900,000"
in excessive reimbursement. It said that it reported the
matter to its Medicare agents and corrected its filings
accordingly.
   The inspector general for investigations for the Health
Care Financing Administration in Atlanta said this week that
the agency is looking into allegations of possible Medicare
and Medicaid fraud related to reimbursements to Charter.
   Charter also acknowledged that the Labor Department is
"continuing its review" of Charter's Employee Stock Ownership
Plan. The investigation was disclosed in an SEC filing
earlier this year but gained little publicity. Charter said
it believes the Labor Department investigation probe is "not
unusual" for ESOPs involved in leveraged buyouts and said it
doesn't believe that any improprieties exist in the ESOP.

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Labor Committee approved a bill
that would impose stiffer sentences for criminal safety and
health violations by employers.
   The committee voted 11-5 for the bill, sponsored by Sens.
Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) and James Jeffords (R., Vt.).
All the Democratic committee members and two Republicans --
Mr. Jeffords and Sen. David Durenberger of Minnesota -- voted
for the measure.

   Separately, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole is expected
today to urge that the maximum civil penalty for a violation
of provisions of child-labor law be boosted to $10,000 from
$1,000. In testimony prepared for delivery to the House Labor
Standards subcommittee, Mrs. Dole will note that the
department's Employment Standards Administration already has
boosted penalties as much as fourfold by considering
different violations involving one child separately, rather
than as a single violation.
   Two recent sweeps by the agency uncovered more than 2,800
child-labor violations, and more than $6 million in penalty
assessments are expected, according to her testimony.
   Under the bill approved by the Senate panel, employer
violations of the occupational safety and health law that
result in worker deaths would become felonies, rather than
misdemeanors. The legislation also would boost the maximum
jail sentence to 10 years from six months and the maximum
fine for such criminal violations under the worker safety and
health law to $250,000 from $10,000 for each violation. The
Justice Department says maximum fines of $250,000 a violation
for individuals and $500,000 for companies already can be
imposed under general criminal code.
   Under the Senate bill, willful violations that result in
serious bodily injury would become a criminal offense subject
to a jail sentence of as much as five years. And any federal
preemption of often-tougher state prosecutions of such
violations on murder or other charges wouldn't be allowed.
   The Bush administration supports the increasing criminal
penalties for employer violations that result in death and
the bar on federal pre-emption. But it opposes making
responsibility for serious bodily injury a criminal offense;
the Labor Department has said it is impossible to define with
any clarity what constitutes such an injury.

   NASA Finds Hubble Telescope Defect,
   Says Many Tests Are Now Impossible

   WASHINGTON -- NASA has found a fundamental defect in the
Hubble Space Telescope that will prevent the space agency's
$2.5 billion eye-in-the-sky -- the most expensive satellite
ever launched -- from performing many of its planned
scientific experiments.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it
discovered that one, or possibly both, of the orbital
telescope's mirrors, manufactured by General Motors Corp.'s
Hughes Danbury Optical Systems subsidiary, was flawed during
manufacturing, making the telescope myopic. The agency said
it didn't uncover the problem during years of testing on the
ground. Over the past two weeks, NASA said, it learned that
the mirrors couldn't focus properly in orbit and wouldn't be
able to take images of distant stars and galaxies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's a grim day for astronomy," said Maarten Schmidt, a
prominent California Institute of Technology astronomer.
   Edward Weiler, Hubble's program scientist, said that
astronomers wouldn't be able to use the telescope's
wide-field camera, the spacecraft's main scientific
instrument, for exploration and that they would have only
limited use of its high-resolution camera as well. The
wide-field camera accounted for 40% of the experiments
planned for Hubble during its first three years of
observations.
   The space telescope was launched April 24 by the space
shuttle Discovery. Astronomers had hoped it would help
resolve some of science's most fundamental questions and hunt
for such exotic phenomena as black holes and distant quasars.
But the spacecraft immediately ran into a host of engineering
problems that had the telescope aiming at the wrong stars,
shutting itself off and wobbling in orbit. NASA said it is on
its way to resolving those problems.
   But the mirror defect is far more serious because it
represents a fundamental flaw in the space hardware that
can't be fixed by changing software commands from Earth. Mr.
Weiler said that he hoped that a replacement camera, due to
be launched by the shuttle in about three years, would be
able to correct for the mirror's flaws -- comparable to
fitting the mirror with glasses. The mirrors, which are big
and fragile, weren't designed to be replaced. During the
first three-year period, Hubble would concentrate on making
observations of the ultraviolet radiation emitted by
celestial bodies, which are blocked by the Earth's
atmosphere, and obtaining data on the chemistry of these
objects.
   Mr. Schmidt said, however, that until Hubble is outfitted
with a new camera it won't be able to attempt to calculate
the size of the universe -- one of its chief objectives --
and would have a hard time hunting for planets around nearby
stars. Astronomers have never definitively identified a
planet outside this solar system. "There are many important
programs that can't be done or will be done with less
efficiency," he said.
   NASA said it believes the mirrors were designed properly
but were manufactured incorrectly because the surfaces
weren't properly measured. The agency said it is setting up a
board of inquiry headed by Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. Hughes Danbury, which made the
mirrors, also blamed measurement technology and said it is
setting up a review panel. A spokesman for the company said,
"If the problem is in the {shape} of the mirror, it wouldn't
be as if we had a set of data and produced to the wrong
specifications."
   One scientist involved in the Hubble program said the
optical equipment used to test the mirror may have been
flawed. He said tests conducted years ago apparently had
given results that the telescope's mirror was properly
formed, when in fact it wasn't.
   At the news conference, Jean Olivier, Hubble's deputy
project manager, offered two explanations of why NASA didn't
catch the problems before launch. First, he said, conducting
a test would cost "hundreds of millions of dollars" and thus
wasn't thought to be worth the money. Then, he said, existing
instruments could have caught the imperfections, but for some
reasons they weren't used to make the necessary measurements.
   The space telescope's problems may adversely affect
another mammoth telescope the space agency is building --
this one costs $1.5 billion and will measure X-ray
emanations. This year, Congress approved $44 million for
early work on the telescope, but required that the mirrors
meet rigorous specifications. Hubble's mirrors were over
budget and behind schedule, contributing to the project's $1
billion cost overrun and delay in launching.

   As our Gerald Seib detailed yesterday, President Bush's
offshore-drilling edict was the product of extended political
calculation. The oil industry rightly objects to his
restrictions on their merits, but we suspect he got the
politics of the situation pretty near right. Given the
psuedo-environmentalist ethic now in force, little new
coastal extraction was to be expected soon in any case. Of
course, White House leadership on difficult issues is
welcome, but the greater responsibility in this case lies
with Congressmen and state officials, including conservative
Republicans, who formed a near-solid wall of opposition to
drilling; with judges, who've demonstrated hair-trigger
sensitivity to anti-drilling lawsuits; and with that segment
of the public that wants cheap gasoline but is intolerant of
the hazards of either tankers or less risky drilling
platforms off the coast. In time, as oil grows dearer, the
matter may become riper for rational choices.

   NEW YORK -- The more bond and stock investors thought
about President Bush's willingness to do anything -- even
raise some taxes -- to trim the U.S. budget deficit, the more
they liked it.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose nearly 3/8 of a
point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, though trading
was light. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.80 to
close at 2862.13, also in light trading. The dollar rose
against the mark but fell against the yen; most of the action
was in such high-yield currencies as the British pound and
Canadian and Australian dollars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The general impression left by the statement the president
made Tuesday morning was that any economic harm from higher
taxes wouldn't be immediate and that the Federal Reserve
Board might ease interest rates if a deficit-cutting package
nears congressional approval.
   Helping bond prices rise was yesterday's surprisingly
successful auction of U.S. Treasury four-year notes. Demand
outstripped the supply by a large enough margin that
investors' worries about a glut of government debt were
eased.
   Robert Smentkowski, a bond trader at Security Pacific
National Bank in Los Angeles, said prices rose shortly after
1 p.m. Eastern time when rumors circulated that the note
auction had gone well. The market already had been rising
because of a growing sense that politicians "seemed to be
serious about talking about reducing the deficit," Mr.
Smentkowski said.
   The bond rally helped push stocks higher, with investors
continuing to buy the so-called defensive stocks of companies
with secure earnings, said Philip Eagan, co-managing director
of institutional services at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   The industrial average would have been higher if American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph shares hadn't been trounced after news
that the company expects lower second-quarter earnings than
many analysts had anticipated. But unlike similar
disappointments earlier in the week, AT&amp;T's news didn't scare
investors out of other stocks. One reason, Mr. Eagan said,
was that analysts saw good news for AT&amp;T's rivals in its
profit troubles.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on volume of 146.6 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 851-597.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.48%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6645 marks and 154.45 yen, compared
with 1.6630 marks and 154.67 yen late Tuesday.

   Here's one pair of lips that never leave too many people
confused: Maggie Thatcher's. Mrs. Thatcher is now pressing
her advantage on the infamous poll-tax issue. That's right,
her advantage. Her political antennae tell her that Britons
are criticizing the government not for the poll tax itself,
but for letting Labor councils get away with high spending.
The people, she says, want tougher restrictions on profligate
councils. Sounds a lot to us like the terms of the debate
over Congress's spending.
   Back in the panic-stricken days of poll-tax riots, cooler
heads were predicting that over time, public attention would
shift from anger over the new tax to dismay over local
council profligacy. That has happened. Spending is now the
focus of attention.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Party is screaming that new government caps on
local-council spending (locals may vote to approve or reject
the cap's new spending level) are a politically motivated
measure directed at the councils it controls. But by making
that charge, the Laborites merely emphasize that they are the
party of high spending. In the method recently legitimized by
a court decision, the government only capped those councils
whose outlays were far beyond the norm.
   The government's handling of this issue obviously has been
far from perfect. But in general, Mrs. Thatcher has
understood the ebb and flow of the controversy better than
anyone else. She strapped herself to the mast, and having
laid the groundwork for local accountability, refused to
budge. A short while ago, pundits everywhere were penning
Thatcher political obituaries. Today, her prospects for
re-election look far from hopeless.
   If she goes on the offensive on the poll-tax issue, she
takes a step toward clarifying the differences between her
party and the Labor Party. Labor has spent the last several
years trying to muddy those differences, stressing its
new-found "realism" and fiscal responsibility.
   Mrs. Thatcher would do her nation a service by making the
next election a referendum on public spending. The
scaled-down Labor Party platform still contains dozens and
dozens of uncosted spending commitments. Neil Kinnock claims
that such expenditures will not require new taxes.
   Recent polls suggest that people in Britain are willing to
pay higher taxes if they can be assured of better health and
education services. But we suspect any poll asking the
British people if they would like to have their public
services delivered more efficiently and at the lowest
possible tax cost would get a resounding yes. Mrs. Thatcher
has taken up arms against those local councils who have not
met that requirement.
   As an issue for the 1990s, it is hard to imagine how she
could have made a better choice, either from a political
point of view or in the interest of improved public policy.

   First Executive Taps Former Auditor
   To Assume Chief Financial Position

   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp. picked its former
independent auditor to be chief financial officer in a
reorganization designed to tighten internal controls and
insulate the company's chairman and chief executive officer,
Fred Carr, from day-to-day contacts with regulators,
investors and the media.
   William L. Sanders, who will become chief financial
officer, treasurer and a corporate vice president on July 1,
has been Deloitte &amp; Touche's partner in charge of auditing
First Executive since 1986. Mr. Sanders, 44 years old, also
has been director of the accounting firm's financial
institutions group in Los Angeles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Mr. Sanders brings a wealth of experience which will be
key in view of the rapidly evolving insurance business,"
First Executive said in a statement.
   The troubled insurance holding company has been under
pressure from regulators and investors to strengthen and
formalize its management procedures, analysts said. "There's
been a perception that Fred Carr runs things a bit by the
seat of his pants," said James Ramenda, an analyst at
Northington Partners Inc. in Avon, Conn.
   First Executive said Mr. Sanders's appointment and other
executive changes will eventually affect the reporting
relationships and jobs of a significant number of employees,
including Mr. Carr. He "has spent an awful lot of time
talking to reporters, securities analysts and investors;
hopefully we can satisfy communications needs without taking
so much of his time," said a company spokesman.
   Mr. Sanders succeeds Merle Horst, 42, who relinquishes the
duties of chief financial officer and treasurer, but retains
the title of vice president. First Executive said he will
oversee the "two newly defined functions" of institutional
markets and industry relations. He also continues as senior
vice president of Executive Life Insurance Co., the company's
main unit.
   In his new post, Mr. Horst will manage the company's
investment products and relations with investors, creditors,
security analysts, rating agencies and insurance regulators.
Although Mr. Horst will have fewer people reporting to him in
his new post, a company spokesman said that the executive
isn't taking a step down.
   "Making sure that regulators and rating agencies
understand the financial strength of our company is
absolutely one of the top priorities here," the spokesman
said. Communications with these groups had been "fragmented
and will be more effective concentrated under a single senior
executive."
   William C. Adams, 44, was named senior vice president of
Executive Life Insurance in charge of a newly formed
corporate services group. Mr. Adams has been a part-time
company consultant since February. He was formerly executive
vice president of Essex Life Insurance Co. in West Orange,
N.J.
   G. Rodney J. Letts, 40, assumes responsibility for
policyholder services for First Executive's five insurance
subsidiaries. He continues as senior vice president of
reinsurance for the largest one of them, Executive Life
Insurance.
   Under the new structure, the number of executives
reporting directly to Alan Snyder, president and chief
operating officer, will be slashed to about eight from 14,
enabling him to manage more effectively, First Executive
said. Some functions handled separately at the parent and
subsidiary level will be consolidated to eliminate
duplication.
   Analysts reactions to the changes were mixed. "Any step
that helps to give policyholders and regulators a sense of
confidence" is positive, said Tom Richter, an analyst at the
brokerage firm of Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta.
Northington Partner's Mr. Ramenda called the moves "cosmetic.
It's the same cast of characters with different names."
   Mr. Ramenda and other critics questioned First Executive's
decision to bring in Mr. Sanders as chief financial officer
in view of some regulators' criticisms of company accounting
practices. A New York state insurance department report that
surfaced in May complained of sloppy accounting systems in
the mid-1980s at the company's New York unit.
   Those problems took place before Mr. Sanders began
auditing First Executive so "it would be misleading to saddle
him with responsibility. "There haven't been any regulatory
criticisms of our accounting practices" since he took over,
the First Executive spokesman said.
   California's Department of Insurance, concerned about
First Executive's depressed junk-bond holdings and the impact
of recent policy surrenders on the company's financial
health, has been conducting a special examination at the
Executive Life Insurance unit since January. The corporate
reorganization wasn't suggested by the insurance department,
a spokeswoman said.

   Dollar Is Little Changed as Traders Look

   NEW YORK -- The dollar ended about where it started as
traders wait for next week's news.
   While market talk still centers on German monetary union
and the mark's rosy future, lower U.S. interest rates and the
dollar's slow demise, risk taking is being avoided this week
with so many market-moving events slated for next week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On Sunday and Monday, banks will distribute marks to East
Germans. On Monday and Tuesday, the U.S. central bank's
Federal Open Market Committee will haggle over credit policy.
   Until then, foreign exchange traders remain a downbeat
bunch. Said John Lyman, the Bank of Tokyo's senior customer
dealer in New York, "People have been burned so much trying
to make a breakout from the {current trading} ranges. Every
time they do, it comes back in their faces. Traders are
frustrated; profits are down; and people are trying anything
to make money."
   The result, said David Ogg, chief New York dealer for
Credit Suisse, is a nervous market that's producing many
erratic moves within a single range.
   An example was provided by the dollar's only mentionable
move on the day. Having slid against all major currencies
Tuesday, slipping under both 1.6700 marks and 155 yen, the
U.S. unit staged a fleeting rally against European currencies
yesterday. The dollar reached 1.6670 marks before slipping.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6645 marks, up from 1.6630 marks late Tuesday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 154.45 yen, down
from 154.67 yen in New York late Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 154.53 yen; it closed Wednesday in Tokyo at 154.35 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6635
marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.6627 marks.
   With no single theme found Wednesday among
foreign-exchange rooms, various traders attributed the day's
price blip to various factors.
   Charles Spence, a Los Angeles vice president with First
Interstate Bank of California, noted that short-term "day
traders" who had sold the dollar earlier in North American
dealings, were forced to buy it back when the U.S. currency
rallied on a positive report of May leading indicators. The
index rose 0.8% on the month, slightly better than
expectations for a 0.7% improvement.
   He said the tables were turned on the dollar when
long-term fund managers who had missed a chance to sell
dollars just below 1.6700 marks during Tuesday's rapid dollar
decline decided to take advantage of the opportunity to dump
the U.S. currency.
   Mr. Lyman of Bank of Tokyo saw other forces at work. He
said some major players went "fishing for stop-loss buying on
short-dollar positions." The speculators bought dollars
against marks and Swiss francs, Mr. Lyman said, and succeeded
in "squeezing some people" before market forces carried the
dollar back down.
   The rally almost took on a life of its own, Mr. Lyman
said. At its intraday peak of 1.6670 marks, the dollar was
near a chart point at 1.6680 marks where many traders would
have shifted their positions from long, or overbought, mark
positions to short, or oversold, postures. That could have
launched the dollar to its next stepping stone at 1.6730
marks, he said. Instead, the dollar settled back.
   The U.S. currency is being held down by its own demerits
and by the advantages of certain competitors.
   Anticipation of lower U.S. interest rates, which would
dissuade investors from buying dollar instruments, is
building again. President Bush's allowance Tuesday that "tax
revenue increases" could be part of a federal budget deficit
reduction package is expected to allow Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan a face-saving way to accede to
administration pressure for lower interest rates.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady added another strong
hint late in the trading session yesterday by questioning the
need for a tight credit policy.
   The issue had already been churned by Washington-based
syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. They
wrote that Fed governors would vote at the policy-making
meeting to ease rates at the end of July.
   As sentiment turns against the dollar, the West German
currency is gathering followers.
   Alan Leventen, managing director of financial services for
Balfour, Maclaine Futures, said the pattern of the mark's
20-pfennig rise since last November suggests the market wants
it to go higher. The mark's technical pattern, Mr. Leventen
said, is the strongest on the market.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current

was a light 2.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $350.75 an
ounce.

   I met this morning with the bipartisan leadership -- the
Speaker, the Senate majority leader, the Senate Republican
leader, the House majority leader and the House Republican
leader -- to review the status of the deficit-reduction
negotiations. It is clear to me that both the size of the
deficit problem and the need for a package that can be
enacted require all of the following: entitlement and
mandatory-program reform; tax revenue increases; growth
incentives; discretionary spending reductions; orderly
reductions in defense expenditures; and budget-process reform
to assure that any bipartisan agreement is enforceable and
that the deficit problem is brought under responsible
control. The bipartisan leadership agree with me on these
points. The budget negotiations will resume promptly with a
view toward reaching substantive agreement as quickly as
possible.
   -- George Bush, June 26

   Gosh, even we didn't realize how badly the Democrats
wanted to raise America's taxes. We'll get to Lips Bush in a
moment, but the sonic boom of elation that Democrats and the
press sent rolling across the land at the mere prospect of a
"tax revenue increase" is a phenomenon you almost have to
stand back a few steps from to take in completely. We'll get
hold of ourselves eventually, but you almost want to reach
into your wallet and Fed-Ex them 20 bucks just to keep the
party going.
   "He's reversing 10 years of Republican catechism on
taxes," cried CBS's Lesley Stahl. "The charade is finally
over," said New Jersey's jubilant Congressman Robert
Torricelli, whose party seems to have spent the last decade
chained to a wall in Ronald Reagan's dungeon. The New York
Times and Washington Post rolled out headlines normally
associated with the ends of wars or statements by Mikhail
Gorbachev. "I Lied]" shrieked a delirious New York tabloid
over the President's picture. Others ran long pent-up wish
lists of schemes to tax, hound and soak the rich wherever the
rascals may be hiding. Flush them out]
   In time, we suppose, the hot air is going to leak out the
balloons and the Beltway will fall back to Earth. What has
changed? The answer is not much at all has changed, if you
share the premise, as we do, that political Washington has
pretty much lost contact with the rest of the country. Here,
for instance, is what conservative Newt Gingrich's Democratic
opponent said back home in Georgia: "Washington has forgotten
that the majority of Americans work for a living and can't
afford a tax increase." A cynic's reaction to Mr. Bush's
statement (and we think a corrosive cynicism toward politics
is indeed spreading among the electorate) would be that
everyone knew that Washington would raises taxes eventually
and little of it will go to reduce federal spending.
   If indeed this is the scenario that plays out, if Mr. Bush
gets TEFRA'd by Congress with phony spending cuts the way
Ronald Reagan did in 1982, then the President will deserve
all the "Jimmy Bush" ridicule that will be heaped upon him.
However, it's far too early in the game to throw in the towel
on this President.
   You'll notice that there were a few other items in that
Bush statement, specifically: reform of entitlements and
so-called mandatory programs, budget-process reform and
growth incentives. We don't think this is boilerplate. Mr.
Bush's closest aides have insisted to anyone who would listen
as far back as the New Orleans convention that he was serious
about putting in place institutional controls on the federal
spending process, an achievement that eluded Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Bush says the point of these reforms is to make any
budget agreement "enforceable." Currently, the principle of
enforceability doesn't exist in the budget process, which is
among the reasons the public holds Congress in such low
regard now.
   Real, set-in-concrete budget-control reform, coupled with
Mr. Bush's cut in the capital-gains tax, would be very much
in the economy's long-term interest, and we have said
previously that we'd accept a tax increase to achieve those
goals. But the budget-reform proposals in Mr. Bush's Tuesday
statement are high hurdles for Democrats to cross before they
get to their promised land of new taxes. We doubt they can
jump that high. We wonder if they'll even try.
   As the budget summit proceeds, there are in fact a few
signs by which anyone interested can tell if the negotiators
are serious. If over the next several weeks you find that
news stories are starting to report regularly on the details
of plans to control entitlements and mandatory spending
programs and to create new budget disciplines, such as
rescission powers for the President, then you'll know
something interesting is in the works. But if all you see is
day after day of changes on the tax-increase story, more
read-my-lips ridicule and tales of Republican anguish, then
you'll know nothing serious is going on.
   A budget summit that ignores the other items in Mr. Bush's
statement is going to end in impasse. Should that day arrive,
George Bush, with Tuesday's statement, will escape blame for
the breakdown. The one lesson we will have learned is that
the Democratic Party exists now for the purpose of raising
taxes. That wild party they threw for themselves in the media
in the wake of Mr. Bush's statement makes this point
unarguable.

   TORONTO -- Michael DeGroote, founder and chairman of
Laidlaw Inc., said he plans to step down as chief executive
officer Aug. 1 and to resign as chairman at year end to
devote more time to personal matters.
   The announcement surprised analysts and investors. More
than six million shares changed hands in trading on the
Toronto Stock Exchange and in over-the-counter trading in New
York. Laidlaw's Class B shares closed at $21.75, down 37.5
cents in hectic over-the-counter trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is the first change in succession we've seen at
Laidlaw," said Steve Garmaise, vice-president of
Toronto-based First Marathon Securities Ltd.
   Mr. DeGroote sold his 47.2% voting stake and effective
control of Laidlaw to Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd. in
1988. That move led many industry analysts to assume he would
step down, at least as chief executive, within the next five
years.
   "But it wasn't expected that Mr. DeGroote would get out
this soon or this completely," Mr. Garmaise said. "People
thought he would still play an active role in determining
strategy and ferreting out acquisitions. So the market is
kind of spooked."
   Mr. Garmaise and some other analysts said they had
expected Laidlaw's stock to rise by as much as $1 yesterday
following an announcement that the company's net income for
the nine months ended May 31 rose nearly 40% to $194.8
million, or 81 cents a share, from $139.6 million, or 68
cents a share, a year earlier.
   "So while the market reaction may seem mild, this news has
not only kept the stock from rising, but has actually pushed
it down," Mr. Garmaise said.
   Laidlaw didn't say who would succeed Mr. DeGroote as
chairman and chief executive, but the company said Donald
Jackson, recently appointed president of the transportation
and waste management concern, will take over responsibility
for day-to-day operations.
   Ivan Cairns, vice president and general counsel, said the
company's board was advised of Mr. DeGroote's resignation
late Tuesday.
   "Mr. Jackson will be running the company, whether he is
eventually appointed chief executive or not," Mr. Cairns
said, adding that the company "has no intent of looking
outside" for someone to fill the chief executive position.
   Mr. Cairns said he expects directors will "take their
time" before announcing a chairman.
   Mr. Jackson joined Laidlaw in August 1989 as executive
vice president. He was appointed president in November.
   "This move clearly indicates that Laidlaw is moving to
further de-emphasize transport and stress the waste
management side of the business," said First Marathon's Mr.
Garmaise.
   Mr. Cairns said Mr. Jackson worked for Calgary-based
Trimac Ltd. for several years and served as chairman of
Trimac's chemical waste disposal unit, Tricil Ltd., which
Laidlaw acquired in November.
   Neither Mr. DeGroote nor Mr. Jackson could be reached for
comment.

   Justices, Upholding FCC License Policies,
   Broadly Support U.S. Affirmative Action

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT (INR)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, upholding federal
programs designed to increase the number of broadcast
licenses held by women and minorities, broadly supported the
power of Congress to adopt affirmative-action plans.
   By a 5-4 vote, the high court ruled for the first time
that Congress may authorize affirmative action, not simply to
correct the effects of past discrimination, but to promote
other goals, such as racial and ethnic diversity.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling, written by Justice William Brennan, upheld two
Federal Communications Commission policies -- adopted by the
agency and later ratified by Congress -- that give
minority-owned and women-owned businesses preferences in
competing for broadcast licenses. The court said the FCC's
rationale -- that minority ownership is desirable because it
promotes diversity in broadcast programming -- was sufficient
to justify the affirmative-action plans.
   The decision is the most sweeping endorsement of
affirmative action ever issued by the court, but its
practical effect may be limited for two reasons. First, the
ruling applies only to federal programs and doesn't alter the
effects of last year's high court decision restricting the
ability of state and local government programs to give
preference to minority-owned businesses. Second, the
political climate in Congress isn't likely to bring about any
major minority-business preference programs.
   However, the decision will make it easier for Congress to
preserve existing plans, including the FCC policies, and
affirmative-action requirements in federal public-works
transportation programs and Education Department projects.
The decision also will help to bolster the transportation
affirmative-action plans against pending court challenges.
   The decision was an extension of a 1980 ruling in which a
splintered high court upheld a minority preference program
adopted by Congress for federal publicworks contracts.
   Yesterday, the majority said that Congress may adopt
race-oriented policies, as long as they are benign, meaning
not intended to discriminate against anyone, and as long as
"they serve important governmental objectives within the
power of Congress and are substantially related to
achievement of those objectives."
   The decision provoked a strong dissent by Justice Anthony
Kennedy, who said the court was permitting "racial
classifications" like those that kept blacks and whites in
"separate but equal" facilities until the desegregation of
the 1950s and 1960s, and that led to the internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II.
   "Policies of racial separation and preference are almost
always justified as benign, even when it is clear to any
sensible observer that they are not," Justice Kennedy wrote,
citing as an example an apartheid policy statement of the
South African government.
   Justice Sandra O'Connor also wrote a dissenting opinion,
joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices
Kennedy and Antonin Scalia.
   The high court ruled on two FCC policies. In one, a
federal appeals court for the District of Columbia in April
1989 declared unconstitutional the FCC's distress-sale
policy, which allows a broadcast company that is in danger of
losing its license to avoid that risk by selling the license
to a minority-controlled business.
   The appeals court ruled for Alan Shurberg, a computer
consultant seeking a television license in Hartford, Conn.,
since 1982. The FCC awarded the license in a distress sale to
Astroline Communications Co., a partnership led by Richard
Ramirez. Astroline appealed the ruling, and the Supreme Court
reversed the appeals-court decision.
   Also in April 1989, a different threejudge panel of the
same appeals court upheld the constitutionality of an FCC
policy that gives minority and women applicants some
preference in receiving new licenses. The appeals court ruled
for Rainbow Broadcasting Co., a 90% Hispanic-owned company to
which the FCC awarded a UHF television license in Orlando,
Fla. The policy was challenged by Metro Broadcasting Inc.
Metro appealed the decision, and the Supreme Court affirmed
the appeals-court ruling.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said the policies were "aimed at
creating more diversity, and we think they have achieved
that. We're pleased that the cloud of doubt has been removed
from them."
   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, executive director of the Media
Access Project, a public-interest communications law firm,
said the decision was "obviously a big surprise." Mr.
Schwartzman called the decision "the most important, clearly
positive affirmative-action ruling in some time." (Metro
Broadcasting Inc. vs. FCC.)
                                                                                                       

   Environmental Lawsuits
                                                                                                       

   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, made it substantially more
difficult for citizens' groups to mount broad legal
challenges to federal government land-use and environmental
policies. In a decision written by Justice Scalia, the
justices barred the National Wildlife Federation, an
environmental group, from suing to challenge Interior
Department plans to open up millions of acres of federal land
in Western states and Alaska to mineral leasing and mining.
   The high court ruled that individuals or groups who
propose to sue over federal land use must offer detailed
evidence of how they would be hurt by the government's
actions; moreover, the evidence must demonstrate injury from
the proposed leasing of specific tracts of land, not for the
overall, general land-use plan.
   Justice Harry Blackmun dissented, joined by Justices
Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Stevens. (Lujan vs.
National Wildlife Federation).
                                                                                                       

   Child-Abuse Witnesses
                                                                                                       

   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ruled that states may permit
alleged victims of child abuse to testify on closed-circuit
cameras or through other indirect methods intended to avoid
their facing defendants in court. Such methods may be used
only when absolutely necessary to protect against emotional
trauma to a child, the court said, and when the defendant's
right to have an attorney cross-examine the child witness is
preserved. Under these circumstances, the defendant's Sixth
Amendment right to confront witnesses isn't violated, the
court said in an opinion written by Justice O'Connor.
   The decision marks the first time the court has directly
endorsed the constitutionality of alternative means of
testifying for children in child-abuse cases. But it ratifies
what most states have adopted for their courts. Thirty-seven
states permit use of videotaped testimony of children; 24
states allow use of one-way closed-circuit television in such
cases.
   Justice Scalia dissented, joined by Justices Brennan,
Marshall and Stevens. (Maryland vs. Craig).
   By another 5-4 margin, in a second case, the court
disallowed a physician's testimony in court about statements
made to him by an alleged child-abuse victim who was
considered incapable of testifying herself. The court said
testimony about the alleged victim's statements can't be used
unless prosecutors explain why the child is unavailable to
testify and why the child's statements to the third party
should be considered reliable. Justice O'Connor wrote the
opinion. Justice Kennedy dissented, joined by Chief Justice
Rehnquist and Justices Blackmun and Byron White. (Idaho vs.
Wright).

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- The most feared gambler on the
boardwalk is a mysterious Japanese baccarat player known as
"The Warrior." He bets $200,000 a hand -- $14 million an hour
-- in spans up to 14 hours. A private chef prepares his
favorite foods: BLT sandwiches and marinated monkey meat.
   Yet so little is known about him that a credit review
circulated among casino officials lists his profession as
"Business." No one knows how he made his money. And even
Donald Trump, his host in an ocean-front casino penthouse,
says, "I don't really know where the hell he comes from."

   His name is Akio Kashiwagi and he is high risk incarnate.
He won $6 million at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in
February, then lost $9.4 million in May when Mr. Trump lured
him back -- after hiring consultants to figure out how to
beat him.
   Mr. Kashiwagi, 53 years old, is Mr. Trump's reclusive
opposite, avoiding interviews and photographers. He runs his
Tokyo real estate business from a shabby two-story building
far removed from the glamour of Trump Plaza. Sipping tea amid
tuxedo-clad barracat croupiers, Mr. Kashiwagi, in his rumpled
blue-striped shirt and plain black slippers, has the the look
of a quarter slot-machine player just off the bus from
Hoboken.
   He throws around $5,000 casino chips with the composure of
someone playing penny pinochle. Flanked by a bodyguard, he
often smiles even when losing. "He plays only for fun," says
Darryl Yong, an aide to Mr. Kashiwagi. Yet he bets more in an
hour than 100,000 typical visitors wager collectively.
   Mr. Trump ordered his guest's private table roped off in
red velvet. He provided hot face towels and allowed him
exclusive use of a nearby casino bathroom. "He's great, the
best in the world," says Mr. Trump.
   Mr. Kashiwagi is a steady player, never varying his bet
whether winning or losing. At one point in last month's
marathon, he lost 11 straight hands at $200,000 each without
flinching. He takes notes describing the results of each
hand, and casino officials rate his skill as excellent. But
unlike many baccarat players, he often seems to bet on
hunches -- without any pattern or concern about how the cards
are going.
   In the parlance of the casino industry, a huge bettor like
Mr. Kashiwagi is a "whale," which surely makes Mr. Trump his
Ahab. Call him crazy, but Mr. Trump wants his croupiers to
play another baccarat marathon with Mr. Kashiwagi. For how
much? "Unlimited. Anything he wants to do," says Mr. Trump --
although his employees say there would certainly be limits.
   The ideal date for the contest would be Dec. 7, the
anniversary of Japan's 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, says
Edward Tracy, president of operations at Mr. Trump's three
casinos in Atlantic City. For advice on making that a day of
infamy for Mr. Kashiwagi, Mr. Tracy is being advised by Jess
Marcum, a mathematician he says "helped develop the atomic
bomb. If he's that good, he can help us beat Kashiwagi."
   Mr. Marcum, nicknamed "The Atheist" by gambling industry
officials because he doesn't believe in luck, only in his
calculations of odds, says he actually helped with the
neutron bomb after World War II. Close enough, says Mr.
Tracy.
   Mr. Trump has also hired Al Glasgow, a gambling industry
consultant, to help size up Mr. Kashiwagi. "He's a real
samurai. He craves a challenge," says Mr. Glasgow. "When he's
taking a break, he'd just as soon sleep on a cot."
   But Trump Plaza provides better: a penthouse suite with
three bedrooms, three baths -- sauna, two butlers and a
pianist. The living room features a smiling jade Buddha
valued at $800,000.
   Not bad, considering that virtually nothing is known about
the true size of Mr. Kashiwagi's bankroll, where it comes
from or how good his credit really is. He was born the son of
a carpenter in a small city near Mount Fuji. One of his first
jobs is said to have been guiding tourists around the
mountain. An older brother, who works for a textile company,
says he doesn't know how his sibling became rich.
   His modest combination house and office near a busy Tokyo
intersection is just down a hill from the offices of Japan's
Diet. Only a small gold colored sign indicates there's a
business inside. Foreign luxury cars are often parked nearby.
In his hometown, Kawaguchiko, he lives in a huge house known
locally as "Kashiwagi Palace."
   He claims $1 billion in assets and income of about $100
million a year. He describes his company, Kashiwagi Shoji
Co., as a real estate and investment concern in which he is
the only principal. His assistant, Mr. Yong, politely brushed
aside a request by this newspaper for details.
   A 1988 report by Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd., a data base of
companies in Japan, shows Mr. Kashiwagi's company with sales
of just $15 million and five employees. An official at the
company says it has about 30 workers now; he declines to
discuss sales. Mr. Kashiwagi isn't listed among the top 30
taxpayers in his district last year, according to Japanese
government records, and tax officials won't talk about
individuals' payments.
   Mr. Kashiwagi took up his heavy gambling hobby about three
years ago, according to Mr. Yong. His biggest win, $19
million in a week, came last February at the Diamond Beach
Casino in Darwin, Australia.
   There, too, he played baccarat, a card game similar to
blackjack in which the winning hand is the one closest to a
point total of nine. Face cards and tens aren't counted.
Baccarat has snob appeal because it has higher minimum bets
than other casino games -- typically $20. But minimums don't
interest Mr. Kashiwagi: Mr. Trump's casino is the only one in
Atlantic City that granted his request for $200,000 a hand.
   Smarting from his $6 million loss to Mr. Kashiwagi in 10
hours last February, Mr. Trump sought a better strategy in
May. His consultants, Messrs. Glasgow and Marcum, suggested
enticing their guest to play longer this time. They proposed
a so-called freeze-out agreement, under which Mr. Kashiwagi
wouldn't quit until he either doubled an initial $12 million
or lost it all. The arrangement isn't binding -- New Jersey
gaming laws permit a player to quit at any time.
   But the freeze-out agreement psychologically snared Mr.
Kashiwagi, says Trump Plaza's Mr. Tracy: "His nostrils were
wide open; he was hooked and going down."
   Mr. Marcum calculated that the casino's risk doesn't
increase with the size of the hand. All that matters, given
the slight 1.25% advantage the rules give the casino in each
hand, is that the customer play long enough to lose
everything. Mr. Marcum's pages of hand-written charts show
that after one hour of play, or about 70 hands, the customer
has a 46% chance of being ahead. After 75 hours, or 5,250
hands, the customer's chance of winning falls to 15%.
   Sure enough, Mr. Kashiwagi was ahead $5.5 million on his
third day at the table. "It was beautiful," recalls Mr. Yong.
But by 4 a.m. on the sixth day, after 5,056 hands in 70 hours
of play, Mr. Kashiwagi was $9.4 million behind.
   Mr. Kashiwagi then left in a huff, tipping poorly and
threatening to burn his autographed copy of Mr. Trump's "The
Art of the Deal."
   Mr. Kashiwagi's people contend that Trump officials broke
the freeze-out agreement by ending the game while they were
ahead. Trump officials say Mr. Kashiwagi quit.
   The Trump casino had advanced Mr. Kashiwagi a $6 million
line of credit to be used only for gambling. But on the way
to his limousine, Mr. Kashiwagi quietly cashed in $474,000 in
chips. He has agreed to pay back everything except that. (He
has also recently paid up for $3 million in losses at the Las
Vegas Hilton.)
   Sources close to Mr. Trump say he'll agree to let his
whale keep that money in hopes he'll return and blow his
stake again. They say Mr. Kashiwagi probably can't resist a
chance for revenge, and Mr. Trump is extending an open
invitation.
   But Mr. Yong says Mr. Kashiwagi will never forgive the
indignities he suffered. For instance, he says, Mr. Trump's
guarantee of credit at Macy's in Atlantic City proved
worthless. Mr. Kashiwagi left the department store in
humiliation without his $5,000 in clothes and other
purchases. Trump officials insist it was a misunderstanding
and say the items were delivered later to their guest's
suite.
   Not good enough, says Mr. Yong, slipping in a dig at their
debt-ridden host. "We pity Mr. Trump's creditors," he says.
"No wonder if they panic."
   Mr. Yong says all this has left Mr. Kashiwagi disenchanted
with baccarat, and his new hobbies will be golf and a
Japanese version of chess. How much he'll bet on those isn't
known.

   House Clears Foreign-Operations Bill
   That Cuts Non-Mideast Arms Aid 13%

   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a foreign-operations bill
of more than $15.6 billion that would cut U.S. arms
assistance outside the Mideast nearly 13% in fiscal 1991 and
withhold half of El Salvador's new military aid after Oct. 1.
   The 308-117 roll call followed final reductions from the
military and World Bank accounts that the Bush administration
considers the most important, but the White House prevailed
elsewhere on two heated fights over international family
planning and U.S. assistance to the non-communist forces in
Cambodia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By a 260-163 margin, the House approved a $7 million
provision continuing the Cambodia funding. However, the
program would be limited to non-lethal assistance, and new
restrictions were imposed in response to criticism that the
insurgents are mounting military operations in cooperation
with the Khmer Rouge.
   The victory represented a personal triumph for Rep.
Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.), who has been a major influence in
shaping the U.S. policy, but Washington's role in the war
remains controversial because of the brutal history of the
Khmer Rouge when it took over Cambodia in the 1970s.
   The overt funding at issue is supplemented by a covert
intelligence program supporting the non-communist resistance
groups. And though no direct aid is permitted to the Khmer
Rouge, critics argue that it has become impossible to
guarantee that U.S. assistance isn't helping the Pol Pot
forces in battle or political negotiations.
   The restrictions on military aid to El Salvador are in
line with provisions adopted this spring by the House, but
the State Department is pressing for a less severe
alternative that would withhold about 30% of the assistance.
Secretary of State James Baker has warned that he will seek a
veto if a compromise can't be reached, but the administration
faces opposition from some of its strongest supporters in the
past on Central America.
   "I'm not just going to roll over," said Rep. John Murtha
(D., Pa.), chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee. "I want something that shows the Salvador army
they have to reform."
   Though Israel is among those protected from cuts in
assistance, the Israeli government was warned in floor debate
that it too could face reductions if no agreement is reached
on new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   "The U.S. has no obligation to fund directly or indirectly
settlements that we regard as an impediment to the peace
process," said Rep. David Obey, chairman of the Foreign
Operations subcommittee. The Wisconsin Democrat made a "flat
commitment" that he would support cuts if recommended by the
Bush administration in response to the Israeli settlement
issue.
   Under pressure from the administration, the House
Appropriations leadership had agreed to provide $50 million
in new capital for the World Bank. But this funding, $60
million less than the president's request, was hurt by a
sweeping 2% reduction approved minutes before final passage
of the bill. Total U.S. contributions to international
financial organizations would be effectively frozen at
current levels, but U.S. Export-Import Bank funding was
exempted and would grow to $750 million, 50% above the White
House request.
   The same 2% cut helped to push total foreign military aid
down to $4.6 billion, or about $222 million below this year's
level and more than $410 million under the president's
budget. Secretary Baker is sure to demand the restoration of
part of these funds in the Senate, but in the House
allocation, the State Department and Pentagon benefit from
added flexibility allowed by Mr. Obey, who resisted efforts
to earmark funding outside the Mideast.
   Among countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
Turkey stands to be most affected by the proposed military
cuts. But the shift in priorities stands to benefit Eastern
Europe, where the bill would add an estimated $180 million to
the administration request for economic assistance. Aid to
sub-Saharan Africa would grow to $800 million, or 40% above
current funding, but this increase is combined with new
restrictions effectively denying any direct funding to
Zaire's Mobutu regime.
   An estimated $245 million is allocated elsewhere for
population-planning accounts, including $1.5 million for
Romania. But on a 224-198 roll call, anti-abortion forces
upheld restrictions that effectively bar two of the largest
organizations, the International Planned Parenthood
Federation and the United Nations Fund for Population
Activities, from participating.
   The floor action came as President Bush's ambitious moon
and Mars space initiative met further setbacks in the Senate
Commerce Committee, which cut all of an estimated $188
million in new money for the undertaking. The House
Appropriations Committee this week made even deeper cuts from
related programs, and though the White House hopes to restore
funds in the Senate, the Commerce Committee vote was a
serious blow to this effort.

   Newmark &amp; Lewis Inc. expects a profit on a 27% sales rise
for its year ending Jan. 31, said Warren G. Hyman,
co-chairman and co-chief executive.
   In the previous year, the discount retailer of electronics
and appliances had net income of $117,000, or two cents a
share, including the effect of an accounting change. Sales
totaled $245.5 million.
</LP>

   Mr. Hyman declined to estimate profit. But he said he
expected sales of between $310 million and $315 million. He
said the current year will include results for nine months of
the retailing assets of Brick Church Appliance Inc., acquired
in May.
   The Hicksville, N.Y.-based company also plans to try to
reduce its sales and general and administrative expenses,
which totaled $66.9 million last year, in part by controlling
expenses more tightly and by achieving some efficiencies of
scale with the acquisition of Brick Church.

   Economy:
   May's Leading Indicators Jumped 0.8%
   But Economists Call Outlook Precarious

   WASHINGTON -- The government's chief economic forecasting
index flip-flopped again, rising solidly last month after
declining slightly in April, the Commerce Department
reported.
   In its second about-face in four months, the index of
leading indicators, which is intended to foreshadow the
economy's health six to nine months in advance, jumped 0.8%
in May, more than recuperating from a 0.1% decline in April.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the strong increase, many economists believe the
wobbly performance of the leading indicators this year means
the economy's future remains precarious. The fluctuations in
the index over the past year leave it only two percentage
points above its level a year ago.
   "That tells me that the economy is moving sideways," said
Richard D.C. Trainer, senior economist at Bank of Tokyo New
York Group. "It's not rebounding, it's not about to topple
into a recession. But it's moving at a very slow pace, a
snail's pace."
   The economy has weakened over the past year, largely the
result of a Federal Reserve campaign to fight inflation by
keeping interest rates high. Manufacturing and housing have
been particularly bruised because purchases in those sectors
often involve borrowing.
   Still, many economists believe the economy doesn't face an
imminent recession. The latest rise in the leading indicators
gave further evidence to support that conclusion. But the
index flashed some worrisome signals, too.
   Building permits, one of the 11 economic indicators making
up the index, fell for the fourth consecutive month, hitting
a disturbingly low level. And an index of consumer
expectations dropped more than any other of the index
components, another in a string of recent signs that
Americans' personal spending is tapering off.
   But at the same time, factory workers put in a longer
average work week than the month before and manufacturers'
orders for capital and consumer goods increased. Both suggest
the beleaguered manufacturing sector could be picking up a
bit.
   "The May leading indicators show that except for housing
and construction, the production side of the economy is
beginning to recover," said William K. MacReynolds, director
of forecasting at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
"But consumers are becoming more pessimistic, leaving future
economic growth in doubt."
   Some analysts believe three consecutive declines in the
leading indicators forewarn an impending recession. But many
economists dismiss this rule of thumb, noting, for example,
that the index dropped for five consecutive months after the
stock market crashed in 1987 but the economy escaped a
downturn.
   Most analyst believe the relative strength of the U.S.
economy in the coming months will depend on the direction of
interest rates. Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to
meet in Washington Monday and Tuesday to set policy for the
ensuing six weeks, but they are expected to leave rates alone
for now.
                                                                                                       

   Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments, they produced a 0.8% increase in the
index for May and a 0.1% decline for April.

   Raytheon's Help From Massachusetts Lawmakers
   Is Study of Arms Politics in Post-Cold War World

   WASHINGTON -- It was a night of Irish song and dinner
hosted by Raytheon Co. for Massachusetts lawmakers.
Executives who had risen from the missile division mingled
with men who had climbed through city wards and the committee
system of Congress.
   Former House Speaker Thomas O'Neill returned, alongside
his Boston College friend, James Dineen, a Raytheon
consultant and former lobbyist. In joking tribute, a jumbo
golf club -- bought by the company's marketing division --
was presented to the retired Speaker. "Adds an extra 25 yards
to my drives," says Mr. O'Neill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The May dinner at a posh Washington hotel followed months
of maneuvering in which the Massachusetts delegation added a
few yards to Raytheon's drives as well. Facing cuts in
Pentagon spending, the Lexington-based company tapped all the
power of the state's liberal lawmakers, protecting its
valuable defense contracts while buying time to pursue
overseas sales of its Hawk and Patriot surface-to-air
missiles.
   The company preserved more than $40 million to continue
production of the Hawk -- even as a senior Pentagon official
acknowledged the Army already has more than it needs. Another
$248 million, cut by the Senate, was restored after two
liberal Massachusetts bulls -- House Rules Committee Chairman
Joseph Moakley, a Democrat, and Rep. Silvio Conte, the
ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee --
intervened to protect a plan for co-producing the Patriot
with Italy.
   "Ought to be called the Conte Stallion," says the feisty
Republican.
   From New England to Naples, the Italian Patriot is a study
in the pork-and-pasta politics of weapon choices in a
post-Cold War world. The program also paints a portrait of
liberals going to bat for the local defense contractor --
even as they call for Pentagon cuts.
   The Raytheon missiles are defensive, but the aggressive
tactics underscore the stakes in this year's budget wars.
With fewer dollars, the bottom line is to outlast the
competition and hope for a larger share of what remains. Or
as a Raytheon executive bluntly described it: "Fewer eaters
of a smaller pie."
   The company boasts a new, more diverse base nationally,
but arms sales are ever-more important to its Massachusetts
division. Only 16% of the workers there are nonmilitary,
compared with 29% in 1979. "They told me 3,200 people were
going to hit the streets if we didn't get the Hawk money,"
Rep. Moakley recalls. "I told them, `You fellas better learn
how to make mobile homes.'"
   Foreign sales offer some reprieve, but in a tight world
market, the Patriot project banks on close ties between the
U.S. and Italy. "At no time in modern history has our strong
trans-Atlantic partnership been more crucial," said President
Bush in toasting Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti in
March. Watching at the black-tie dinner was Raytheon's
president, Dennis Picard.
   When conceived under the Reagan administration, the
U.S.-Italian agreement was a model of burden-sharing and
technology transfer between friends. But as the Soviet threat
has diminished, the high costs have drawn criticism at home
and abroad. "It is of very limited value," says Rep. John
Murtha, chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee. "It is a program whose time has come -- and
gone."
   Under the program, the U.S. must put up $500 million to
pay Raytheon for the most sophisticated radar and control
equipment, while an Italian consortium would be licensed to
co-produce Patriot launchers and 1,280 missiles. Rome would
gain a modern air defense and enhanced status in NATO. But it
must invest over $6 billion as part of the deal to procure
not only Patriot but also shorter-range, Italian-made air
defense systems to protect U.S. bases in Italy.
   Like Washington these days, Rome may resort to its own
version of off-budget financing. "The means by which the
money will be found is not yet clear," says Giuseppe
Bedeschis, manager for the three Italian arms companies in
Consorzio Italmissile. Special legislation is required but
has yet to be presented to parliament, even as the Pentagon
has approved a $414 million contract for Raytheon to begin
work on the U.S. share of the program.
   Part of the Pentagon's eagerness may be its own desire to
build a new Air Force base in southern Italy. Thousands of
Patriots are already deployed in Europe against a crumbling
Warsaw Pact. Even though the existing Patriots are mobile,
and could be shifted to confront threats from elsewhere,
officials defend the new production as needed and hint darkly
of the threat to Italy and NATO from Moammar Gadhafi across
the Mediterranean.
   Raytheon Chairman Thomas Phillips speaks too of a "threat
from Libya." But in Italy this analysis weakens. "Our main
threat is not Gadhafi," says Mr. Bedeschis. Libya, in fact,
was a large investor from 1976 to 1986 in Fiat S.p.A., whose
SNIA-BPD subsidiary is a partner in the Patriot program.
SNIA's own history is controversial because of its alleged
involvement in rocket projects financed by Iraq, and though
the company denies any wrongdoing, critics argue it has
contributed to the development of the very type of tactical
missiles the Patriot is meant to protect against.
   Building the American missile is foremost a lesson in
systems engineering, says Mr. Bedeschis, but Italian defense
contractors hope for an edge too in breaking into the U.S.
and foreign markets. "Our armed forces are not a big enough
client for our weapons industry," explains Italian Sen. Luigi
Poli, a former Army chief-of-staff.
   Selenia Industrie Elettroniche Associate S.p.A., another
partner in the consortium, needs work for its plant in
Naples, and will gain as well from the sale of its Spada
air-defense system to the government. Contacts with U.S.
lawmakers are limited, but Rep. Charles Wilson (D., Texas), a
member of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, has
been entertained in Rome and Washington by executives of
Contraves Italiana S.p.A., whose Skyguard system would be
paired with Spada as part of the project.
   For its part, Raytheon's stake could reach more than $1.2
billion, counting fees from the Italian share, but the timing
is crucial. The company is pursuing sales in the Mideast and
South Korea; the Italian program is crucial to keeping down
costs because it permits the company to keep its production
lines open.
   Raytheon is a skilled and proven contractor but its
success has fostered a certain arrogance, as when executives
speak of the Massachusetts missile plant as a "national
treasure." Dark clouds illustrate a glossy Patriot brochure
released last year with the prediction that "Warsaw Pact air
forces will continue their qualitative growth well into the
next century." Today, without seeming to lose a step, comes a
multicolored map listing the spread of tactical missiles in
"Third World Nations."
   "They are very hard-nosed," says Rep. Nicholas Mavroules
(D., Mass.) of Raytheon. His seat on the House Armed Services
Committee has made him a valued company ally -- and a
recipient of Raytheon speaking fees. "We're buying them time
for a transition period."
   But three weeks after the May dinner -- and days after the
award of the Italian Patriot contract -- the mood and message
were confident at the company's annual meeting. "Raytheon is
not rushing to diversify," read the headline in the next
morning's Boston Globe.

   Siemens Unveils
   East German
   Investment Plan

   Firm Pegs One Billion Marks
   For Projects, Expects
   To Hire 30,000 Workers

   BONN -- West German electronics giant Siemens AG plans to
pour more than one billion German marks ($602 million) into
East Germany over the next several years as part of a bid to
become a market leader on the other side of the
fast-vanishing German border.
   In an announcement designed to highlight the scope of its
efforts, the company said it will employ between 25,000 and
30,000 workers in these new projects and expects the business
volume associated with the ventures to reach five billion
marks a year. The announcement comes just days before East
Germany adopts the West German mark as its currency and
illustrates the scramble by West German companies eager to
snare a piece of the East German market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We see {East Germany} as a future part of our home
market, so we want to start treating it that way now," said
Eberhard Posner, a Siemens spokesman. He added, however, that
East Germany "will never be a substitute for investments in
other parts of the world."
   The company's rush into East Germany is matched by
smaller-scale moves into other Eastern European markets.
Today, Siemens is expected to sign a joint venture with
Polish telecommunications company Zwut, which aims to install
one million telephone lines a year by 1995. And last week,
the Munich-based company signed a joint venture accord with
the Soviet company Korolov to produce digital public
telecommunications systems in Kiev.
   The company's East German program -- covering everything
from telecommunications and factory automation to medical
technology and environmental equipment -- represents by far
the largest effort in East Germany by any Western electronics
concern.
   Siemens is working on at least 30 separate projects in
East Germany, including a venture to modernize the telephone
systems in six cities. Yesterday's announcement, while
unveiling no new ventures, was the company's first public
effort at "summing up" the full value of its plans. The
announcement also comes just weeks after the relaxing by
Western nations of high-technology export controls.
   Siemens move has some political overtones. East Germany is
bracing for a cold plunge into capitalism, with some experts
predicting mass unemployment as the nation's creaking
factories get battered by free-market forces. Bonn
politicians have grown scornful of private industry's
high-profile announcements but slow-footed moves to actually
start pouring money into the East to create jobs. West
Germany is counting on private investments to dull the pain
of economic unification.
   Siemens officials said they've had to wait for the
clarification of key legal issues before they could start
pouring money into East Germany.
   Meanwhile, the company has begun to build up a sales and
service network. For example, Siemens has opened one of 12
new sales and service centers for construction-related
electrical equipment and expects the others to open in coming
months. The company expects booming business in this area, as
East Germans rush to renovate old houses and factories. "All
of their houses need to be modernized," said Mr. Posner, "and
we want to be a major player in that area." He admitted,
however, that this is only a small slice of the new market.
   Over the longer term, Siemens plans to concentrate on
developing the same core businesses that increasingly
dominate its activities in other major markets --
telecommunications, energy generation, computer technology
and factory automation. "Siemens is a long-term oriented
company, and these are the areas where Siemens sees its
future -- whether we're talking about East Germany or any
other new market," said George Verghese, an electronics
analyst at the securities research unit of Deutsche Bank AG
in London.
   Mr. Verghese said he expects Siemens to quickly move from
simply shipping products to East Germany to using it as a
base for assembly, and eventually for production.
   Siemens officials emphasized that most of the 25,000 to
30,000 new employees will be East Germans. Up until now, West
Germans have played key roles as advisers in Siemens's East
German ventures. Half of the East German staff will be newly
hired, said Siemens officials, while the rest will come from
existing East German companies. Siemens employs 376,000
people world-wide.
   Siemens is expected to be one of the first West German
companies to reap the benefits of German economic union, not
least because the Bonn government is subsidizing the
upgrading of East Germany's rickety telecommunications
system.

   CFTC Rakes the SEC's Findings
   On Mini-Crash as Turf War Flares

   WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
fired another volley in its increasingly bitter war against
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In a scathing critique of the SEC's report on the
stock-market plunge of last Oct. 13, CFTC Chairman Wendy
Gramm accused the rival regulator of "selectively omitting"
important data and "misleading" the public about the causes
of the market crash.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest skirmish centers on the October mini-crash in
which the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190.58 points;
almost all of the plunge was during the session's final 80
minutes of trading. Following the decline, both regulatory
agencies sought to determine the cause of the collapse --
often using shared data.
   The conclusions, however, emerged as sharply different in
separate reports released last month. The SEC contended that
program selling on the Chicago futures markets triggered the
6.9% stock-market drop. The securities agency also contended
that traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were net
sellers during most of the collapse, thereby helping to fuel
the stock market's sharp drop.
   The CFTC study disputed that view, contending that
"frequently there were larger concentrations of futures
buying than selling during those periods of pronounced price
declines."
   Because of the odd division over the reports, Rep. Glenn
English (D., Okla.) asked Mrs. Gramm to analyze the SEC
study.
   Yesterday, Mrs. Gramm fired off a scorching attack on the
SEC report. "By selectively omitting critical data from their
analysis, the SEC's report, in specific cases, is
misleading," she wrote to Rep. English, who heads the House
subcommittee that oversees the CFTC. "If the SEC is
attempting to place the blame at the futures market for last
October's volatility, that is like blaming the fire
department for always being found at the scene of the fire."
   Rep. English also was angered over the SEC report. "This
analysis provides clear evidence," he said, "that the SEC's
report is biased against and deficient in its understanding
of futures trading."
   An SEC spokeswoman said the agency wouldn't comment until
it has had a chance to review the CFTC's letter.
   Mrs. Gramm's missive comes at an intense time for the
agency, which is trying to fend off a Bush administration
proposal to shift oversight of stock-index futures to the SEC
from the commodities agency.
   Stock-index futures, which often are used in computerized
program-trading strategies, allow investors to bet on the
movement of a basket of stocks without owning the actual
shares. They are most often used by pension funds and mutual
funds to hedge risk.
   Rep. English contended that the SEC report, which was
written by lawyers in the agency's market-regulation
division, was an attempt to cast the CFTC in a negative
light. The CFTC's response "only confirms what I and other
members of Congress have suspected all along about this
issue," he said. "It's a power grab."
   Mrs. Gramm's nine-page letter offers other rebukes of the
SEC. "If the SEC is implying that the price drop of October
13, 1989, would not have occurred if they had been the sole
regulator of all stock-index derivative markets," she wrote,
"they are making promises they cannot keep."
   Moreover, she said, "by casting price falls as a negative
event, while portraying rises as favorable, the SEC confuses
legitimate price discovery with volatility."
   In other places, she said that the SEC report offered
"virtually no analysis to support" various assertions, and
added that "the facts are contradictory."

   NEW YORK -- Stocks finished higher as investors bought up
blue-chip shares despite disappointing earnings news from
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.80 to 2862.13.
Volume totaled 146,620,000 shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, where advancing issues outpaced decliners 851 to
597.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T stunned analysts yesterday morning when it announced
that second-quarter earnings, to be reported in midJuly,
would be below the $699 million, or 65 cents a share,
reported in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had been
anticipating earnings improvement; in a recent poll of 11
analysts by Zacks Investment Research, the lowest estimate
was 68 cents.
   The stock finished down 2 1/8 to 39 1/8 on huge volume of
11,528,900 shares. AT&amp;T's composite volume was the third
highest of the year for any Big Board issue, and the highest
since 14.3 million shares of Amax were traded Feb. 5.
   "Everybody thought the AT&amp;T numbers would pull the market
down," said Richard Meyer, head of equity trading at
Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.
   But to the surprise of many traders, the AT&amp;T sell-off
didn't spread to other stocks. As a result, investors'
confidence rose, and they started buying health, drug and
consumer issues and other stocks of companies with a history
of solid earnings growth. Stock-index arbitrage buy programs,
where traders buy or sell stocks and offset the position in
futures to profit from price differences, also lifted shares.
   Among broad averages, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
rose 3.08 to 355.14; the New York Stock Exchange composite
index climbed 1.40 to 193.87 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index added 2.59 to 330.29.
   "Some of the consumer nondurable stocks, which look
overvalued, are getting more so because it is the safe place
to put money on a short-term basis," said Robert Stovall,
president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers.
   Drug stocks, many of which are trading at a higher
price-earnings ratio to the overall market, advanced.
Bristol-Myers Squibb added 1 7/8 to 63 1/4 on 1.3 million
shares; Merck advanced 1 3/8 to 84 1/4; Johnson &amp; Johnson
rose 1 3/4 to 66 5/8; Warner-Lambert gained 1 7/8 to 64 1/8,
and Eli Lilly climbed 1 5/8 to 81.
   Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Barbara Ryan told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report she expects second-quarter
earnings for the group to be up 14% from a year earlier on a
10% sales rise.
   Humana surged 3 to 48 1/2 to lead a rally among
health-care issues. Manor Care rose 1/4 to 14 1/4, Community
Psychiatric Centers gained 1/2 to 26 3/4 and National Medical
Enterprises added 1/2 to 37 1/8.
   In the pollution-control sector, Waste Management rose 1
3/4 to 41 on one million shares. Browning-Ferris Industries
rose 3/8 to 43 1/2; the company agreed to sell used aluminum
cans to Aluminum Co. of America for recycling. Alcoa closed
unchanged at 63 7/8.
   Amid the slump in AT&amp;T, two other notable casualties of
earnings-related selling this week extended their declines:
Caterpillar, which fell 1/4 to 52 1/4 as 1.5 million shares
were traded, Dow Chemical, which dropped 3/8 to 57 on 1.4
million shares.
   But United Telecommunications, which went through a bout
of selling two weeks ago after PaineWebber lowered estimates
of the company's earnings, gained 1 3/8 to 38 3/4 on 1.2
million shares. Other telephone stocks also fared well
despite the selling in AT&amp;T; GTE climbed 1 1/8 to 32 and Bell
Atlantic added 7/8 to 50.
   L.A. Gear rose 1 1/8 to 27 1/4 after the company reported
earnings of 51 cents a share for the quarter ended May 31, in
line with its projection earlier this month of 50 cents to 60
cents a share. The stock had lost 1 3/8 points Tuesday as
market players awaited the results.
   PPG Industries retreated 2 7/8 to 46 3/8. This newspaper
detailed the environmental problems facing the company
because of chromium-waste pollution in Jersey City, N.J.,
where PPG once processed chromium ore.
   Fluor gained 7/8 to 46. Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil
company selected the company's Fluor Daniel unit to manage
the expansion of its oil and gas production facilities. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   Sotheby's Holdings dropped 5/8 to 16 3/4 after the
1989-1990 art auction season ended with a disappointing sale
in London, in which 58% of the artworks put up for bids
failed to sell.
   Elsewhere on the earnings front, Family Dollar Stores
added 1/2 to 13 after reporting that net income for its
fiscal third quarter, ended May 31, was up 65% from a year
ago.
   West Co. lost 1 3/4 to 17 3/8. The company said its
second-quarter earnings could be more than 50% lower than a
year ago because of production problems in the U.S. and a
curtailment of business in Brazil.
   Times Mirror dropped 1/8 to 31 1/2 after saying that
operating results for the second quarter "will show no
improvement" from its first-quarter results.
   Hunt Manufacturing fell 2 to 13 3/8. The company said its
earnings for the fiscal quarter ended June 3 were down 48%
from the year-ago period, and its hopes for record net income
this year have been "all but dashed."
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.25
to 357.05. Volume totaled 12,350,000 shares.
   Bolar Pharmaceutical fell 3/8 to 5 1/8. Certain sellers of
SmithKline Beecham common stock filed a class-action suit
against Bolar over its alleged submission of fraudulent data
to the Food and Drug Administration to obtain approval for a
generic version of Dyazide, SmithKline's blood-pressure drug.

   Bill to Reregulate
   Cable TV Clears
   Hurdle in House

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The House Telecommunications subcommittee
passed a bill to reregulate cable television rates and
encourage new competitors to challenge existing cable
companies.
   Under the measure, which passed on a voice vote, the
Federal Communications Commission would establish the maximum
fee that cable operators could charge for basic cable service
consisting of local broadcast signals and public education
and government channels. Other cable programming would be
subject to regulation as well, but on a case-by-case basis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The legislation would direct the FCC to develop criteria
to identify "unreasonable or abusive" rates and to establish
procedures for reducing rates that are excessive. Local or
state authorities could file complaints with the FCC alleging
that rates are unreasonable or abusive.
   The legislation also seeks to ensure that emerging
competitors to cable companies -- such as so-called wireless
cable operators and direct broadcast satellite service -- can
obtain programming. Cable programmers that are owned wholly
or in part by cable operators, for example, couldn't
unreasonably refuse to sell programming to cable competitors.
Also, cable operators couldn't require exclusive arrangements
from cable programmers as a condition for carrying their
programs.
   But the future of the House bill and of a similar Senate
measure is cloudy. Cable interests are fighting both
measures. "We intend to remain involved in the process, but
at this point, the question of whether a bill acceptable to
the industry can be enacted this year remains very much
unresolved," said the National Cable Television Association.
   Consumer groups, however, claimed a victory because the
House committee bill contains stronger consumer protections
than the cable reregulation bill that the Senate Commerce
Committee passed this month. "Consumers, satellite services,
broadcasters and others got their pound of flesh -- all out
of cable's hide," said Gene Kimmelman, legislative director
for the Consumer Federation of America.
   Meanwhile, telephone companies are trying to lift the ban
on their entry into the cable business. An amendment that
would permit cable competition from phone companies is
expected to be considered when the bill reaches the House
floor.

   Horsburgh, Pioneer of Country Funds,
   To Help Barclays Unit on U.S. Start-up

   NEW YORK -- A pioneer of the country-fund craze in the
U.S. has found a new home.
   Michael Horsburgh, who co-headed Bear Stearns Cos.'
international equity department for nearly 10 years before
leaving last year, joined Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment
Management to launch and head its U.S. investment-fund
business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a senior managing director at Bear Stearns, Mr.
Horsburgh, 45 years old, was principally known for the
development of several funds that invested in securities of a
single country. His work helped open the field of country
funds to U.S. investors, leading to a frenzy among Wall
Street securities firms to launch investments in such exotic
markets as Malaysia and Turkey.
   Unlike early country funds that had focused on markets in
countries that had been closed to U.S. investors, Mr.
Horsburgh developed funds -- such as First Australia Fund and
Scandinavia Fund -- that invested in nations already open for
investors. He also helped launch First Hungary Fund.
   Mr. Horsburgh resigned from Bear Stearns last fall after
13 years at the big securities firm. But Bear Stearns
insiders say he was forced out after disagreements with top
Bear Stearns executives over the firm's international
investment strategy.
   For his part, Mr. Horsburgh said he left Bear Stearns
"completely friendly," adding that he felt it was "time for a
change."
   Two Bear Stearns executives with global stock experience,
James Sheehan and Dennis Baum, succeeded Mr. Horsburgh in
heading the firm's international equity area.
   At Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, a unit of
the investment banking and securities arm of British bank
Barclays PLC, Mr. Horsburgh will serve as managing director
and concentrate on launching an investment-fund business in
the U.S., largely for institutions. The unit currently
manages $35 billion for institutional investors in Europe,
Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Canada.
   In an interview, Mr. Horsburgh conceded that the
competition will be stiff, but said there's room for growth.
"The use of international investments has certainly grown,
but it's still significantly lower for the average (U.S.)
institution than the typical institution in Europe," he said.
   The move by Barclays is part of a broad strategy at
increasing its U.S. presence. Earlier this year, the firm
hired several former Drexel senior stock analysts and support
staff to beef up its international securities business in the
U.S. The hires included economist Richard Hoey, investment
strategist Abby Joseph Cohen and financial-services analyst
John Keefe.
   Before joining Bear Stearns, Mr. Horsburgh was a partner
at Hoare, Govett Ltd., a London securities firm. He joined
Bear Stearns in 1976 as an institutional equity salesman and
was appointed co-head of the international equity department
in 1980.

   HUTCHINSON, Kan. -- Collins Industries Inc. said it
received a one-year contract to provide ambulances valued at
about $12 million to the U.S. General Services

   Collins, a maker of specialty vehicles, said the contract
gives the GSA the option of placing two additional one-year
orders. The company said that if the agency exercises those
options, Collins would provide a total of about 1,200
ambulances with a value of about $60 million.

   ALTHOUGH MANY computers weigh only a few pounds, marketing
types on the road may lug around 50 pounds of computer
equipment. Many simply can't do without color screens, which
are available only on bulky, desktop machines.
   Now, some tired arms may get needed relief, as a few
companies have announced laptops with impressive color
screens that weigh in the 15-to-20-pound range.
   Dolch Computer Systems of San Jose, Calif., and Dauphin
Technology of Lombard, Ill., both recently announced systems,
available this fall, that use screens from Hitachi Ltd. The
U.S. arm of Sharp Corp., in Mahwah, N.J., has demonstrated a
system that it says should be available by the end of the
year. Consultants add that at least a couple of other
companies will introduce color laptops by the fall, and such
systems will be widely available by next spring.
   There are still drawbacks, of course. The screens are
expensive, adding as much as $4,000 to the cost of a laptop.
Even as prices fall over the next year, systems with color
screens will probably carry a $1,000 to $1,500 premium. In
addition, the systems weigh far more than the four to six
pounds of so-called notebook computers -- a weight that more
customers are coming to expect. They also consume so much
power that they can't run on batteries, meaning an umbilical
cord must still attach the systems to a wall socket.
   The limitations mean that the systems will initially be
bought only by the truly weary. But at least they're a start.
                                                                                                       

   Help Arrives to Deliver
   Satisfied Customers
                                                                                                       

   CUSTOMERS RARELY understand why they must set aside a
whole day to get that new couch delivered -- or how the
delivery person manages to always come right after they've
ducked out for a short errand.
   But an energy utility has produced a system that should at
least narrow that window during which delivery or service is
promised. The system should also ensure that calls are made
only when someone is home.
   The system, called C-ARDS and marketed by CNG Energy Co.
of Pittsburgh, involves attaching a small computer terminal
to the radio in each service van. When getting set to go to
the next stop, the driver puts the cursor on the customer's
name and hits a button. The radio transmits the name to a
central computer, which calls the home and plays a message
saying that the service person will arrive within a few
minutes. If no one picks up the phone, the visit is
rescheduled.
   Because the driver checks in after finishing each job,
that also helps the central office keep track of who's where
at what time. Cox Cable Cleveland Area Inc., a unit of Cox
Enterprises Inc. and a test site for the CNG system, says
C-ARDS has let it narrow the window during which it promises
service to roughly three hours from four. The system also
lets the cable-TV company call customers during the day of
installation or repair and give them more precise estimates.
   "It's working," says Ron Hammaker, general manager of Cox
Cable Cleveland.
   Now if that couch could just come on a Saturday.
                                                                                                       

   One Little Chip Spells
   A Lot More Capacity
                                                                                                       

   THE DAYS are long gone when having any sort of hard disk
in a personal computer was considered a luxury. These days,
many PCs have hard disks that can store 320 megabytes of
data, and some even surpass a gigabyte -- a billion
characters of data, or enough capacity to store as many Great
American Novels as most people would ever care to write.
   But consumers thirst for capacity, so computer makers try
to stuff bigger and bigger disk drives in their machines.
   InfoChip Systems Inc., a small company in Santa Clara,
Calif., says it has an easy way to increase capacity, and
without bigger disk drives: It has a chip that it says will
roughly triple the capacity of current disk drives.
   InfoChip will sell the chip on a $199 circuit board, which
buyers can simply plug into their existing PCs to instantly
add bytes. The company also hopes to sell the chip to PC
makers, which can build them into their computers,
inexpensively enlarging capacity.
   The chip operates by doing very fast compression of data
when the PC is trying to write on the hard disk and,
conversely, rapid decompression when the central processor is
trying to read data. InfoChip says the chip shouldn't slow
the system; writing data can take longer, but reading data
can be done faster.
   John Murphy, a consultant at Wohl &amp; Associates, Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., who saw the chip demonstrated at the Comdex
trade show this month, says: "This is the most interesting
thing I've seen at Comdex in years."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   THE PIPE ORGAN at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris has
been a group undertaking for centuries, with the organist
hopping around to the various keyboards while assistants work
the stops that help control them. Complicating things
further, it can take seconds for a keystroke to work its way
through the instrument and reach the huge pipes. Now, an IBM
PC is being wired into the works, letting the organist
program the positions of the stops ahead of time and
eliminate the delay in the sounds. . . . A chemistry journal
edited at the University of California-Santa Cruz not only is
distributed on floppy disks: Tetrahedron Computer
Methodology, published by Pergamon Press, includes software
on the disks that do such things as draw 3-D molecules and
rotate them on-screen to demonstrate a point.

   U.S. Is Investigating All Failed Thrifts
   In Its Control for Ties to Milken, Drexel

   WASHINGTON -- All failed savings and loans under
government control are now being investigated for ties to
former junk-bond king Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., federal regulators said.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which investigates
possible fraud at all insolvent thrifts, said yesterday it's
launching a special task force to examine whether Drexel
contributed to the failures and will pursue those losses in
Drexel's bankruptcy case. The FDIC expects preliminary
findings for these 350 thrifts in about one month, the agency
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We want to make sure that as far as Drexel and Milken
relationships go, the investigators accelerate that work and
get their findings in to us," said Jack Smith, deputy general
counsel of the FDIC.
   Two things prompted the FDIC to step up its Drexel
investigation beyond several large institutions. For one,
forming the task force indirectly acknowledges that more
thrifts have ties to Drexel -- through purchases of
high-risk, high-yield "junk" bonds and loans to the firm --
than was previously thought. Also, the bankruptcy court
recently imposed a Nov. 15 deadline for creditor claims, the
agency said.
   Mr. Smith won't say how much Drexel contributed to thrift
losses, except to say, "It's in the millions of dollars."
Failed S&amp;Ls hold a total of about $4 billion to $6 billion in
junk bonds.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission says it is Drexel's
largest unsecured creditor because of the $150 million that
Drexel has pledged to it under a consent decree to compensate
civil claimants who seek recourse for losses. Yesterday, FDIC
General Counsel Alfred Byrne said in a statement: "In fact,
we believe that the FDIC and the (Resolution Trust Corp.) may
be among the largest creditors in the Drexel bankruptcies.
Through this new task force, and through other measures, we
intend to recover the maximum amount possible for our
insurance funds and ultimately, for the American taxpayer."
   The FDIC's bankruptcy probe is running a parallel course
to several other pending federal Drexel investigations by the
Justice Department and the SEC. Several large, insolvent
thrifts, including Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association of
Irvine, Calif.; CenTrust Savings of Miami, and Columbia
Savings of Beverly Hill, Calif., were big customers of
Drexel. Many of these thrifts, it is alleged, swapped the
junk bonds and booked artificial profits on the sales.
   "We will keep a sharp eye out for daisy-chain operations,"
Mr. Smith said.
   Federal investigators will also be looking at whether
CenTrust was able to raise capital through Drexel in exchange
for buying millions of dollars of Drexel-issued junk bonds.
   "There are other institutions that had relations with
Drexel," Mr. Smith of the FDIC said. "The question is whether
you find losses associated with that. That's what we are
looking into."
   Mr. Milken earlier this year pleaded guilty to six felony
counts of securities fraud, and agreed to pay $600 million in
fines and restitution. He is expected to be sentenced in
October. Mr. Milken hasn't cooperated with the investigation
so far, but is expected to do so after sentencing. One
government official said yesterday that at that point,
government investigators expect him to cooperate with the
bankruptcy investigation as well.
   The task force will include about a dozen attorneys in
Washington, and dozens more in the field, Mr. Smith said.

   Canadian Dollar
   Defiant Strength

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian dollar is demonstrating again what
attractive interest rates can do for a shaky currency.
   Economists have been predicting a decline in the Canadian
dollar for more than a year, and with good reasons: The
country has a huge foreign debt. The government is running a
massive budget deficit. The trade balance is deteriorating.
And there is the persistent push for independence in Quebec,
which accounts for one-fourth of the population.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian dollar, on the basis of its purchasing power,
"is overvalued about 8%," says Francis Scotland, managing
editor of International Bank Credit Analyst, a Montreal-based
forecaster of currency trends.
   Traders were braced for a fall in the Canadian dollar,
after a constitutional plan to appease Quebec was killed over
the weekend. But the currency again defied predictions and
rose every day this week, closing in Toronto yesterday at
85.50 U.S. cents, up from 85.38 cents Tuesday.
   The Canadian dollar's strength owes to a relentless fight
against inflation by the Canadian central bank. The Bank of
Canada has pushed short-term Canadian interest rates about 5
1/2 percentage points above U.S. rates, double the margin of
two years ago.
   The interest spread is keeping the Canadian dollar firm,
says Jody Foulks, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris
Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago. Mr. Scotland, the editor,
says Bank of Canada Governor John Crow has become the Western
world's fiercest inflation fighter.
   Rates are so high that they make it very pricey to sell
the Canadian dollar short, betting the oft-predicted decline
will materialize soon. It costs about half a cent a month for
each Canadian dollar to run a short dollar position, says Rod
Fowler, foreign exchange director at the Bank of Montreal.
   Some high rollers took the risk Friday, betting that the
constitutional agreement with Quebec would fail. But on
Monday, the Canadian dollar rose one-tenth of a U.S. cent.
This forced speculators to buy back Canadian dollars that
they had sold with borrowed funds in anticipation of a Monday
decline that would have produced profits on the difference.
   With Canada's constitutional setback, traders "bought on
the rumor, sold on the news," says Richard Witten, vice
president and chief of foreign exchange trading at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. in New York. He says traders decided that the
news wasn't bad enough to do without the big interestrate
differential favoring the Canadian dollar.
   Aron Gampel, Bank of Nova Scotia economist, agrees that
"the Bank of Canada's anti-inflation stance continues to be a
beacon for foreign capital inflows" into Canada. But he says
the 5 1/2 percentage-point premium of Canadian rates over
U.S. rates "can't persist." He says the Canadian economy is
"close to stalling out, with serious strains in manufacturing
and construction."
   The anti-inflation policy is beginning to show positive
results, as well. Most inflation indicators are moving in the
"right direction," Finance Minister Michael Wilson said in an
interview. But both Mr. Wilson and Gov. Crow remain concerned
about rising Canadian wage settlements and their damage to
Canada's competitive position in the U.S.
   The U.S. and Canada trade more with each other than do any
other pair of countries, and the U.S. takes about
three-fourths of Canada's total exports. Canada's unit labor
costs -- the most commonly used measure of how competitive a
country is on production costs -- grew 6.9% in the 1989
fourth quarter. The growth of U.S. unit labor costs remained
close to 5% throughout last year.
   Mr. Wilson said the government won't relax its monetary
policy until inflationary pressures are clearly under
control. "We know that financial markets will be watching
very closely to see if we ease in a premature way," he said.
   Mr. Wilson is concerned about the potential inflationary
effect of a planned 7% consumption tax that is to take effect
Jan. 1. While he doesn't expect the tax itself to boost the
consumer price index by more than 1.25 percentage points next
year, he is worried that it could trigger a new round of
inflationary wage settlements.
   Canada's recent inflation record has been encouraging,
says Michael Gregory, Royal Bank of Canada economist. Its
consumer price index in May rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2%
from April, the same rate as in the U.S.
   Mr. Gregory predicts that the downturn in inflation will
allow short-term Canadian interest rates to decline modestly
about late August or September. This retreat in turn would
trigger a drop in the Canadian dollar to about 82 U.S. cents,
he says.
   Sylvain Leith, National Bank of Canada economist, says the
Bank of Canada "has set its sights on joining the ranks" of
strong-currency countries, such as West Germany and Japan.
But he says the Canadian dollar will remain shaky until the
Canadian government is able to reduce significantly its big
budget and trade deficits. Canada's current account deficit
in its balance of payments totaled a record 5.08 billion
Canadian dollars (US$4.33 billion) in the first quarter.
   Canada has built up a foreign debt totaling C$229 billion,
or about 35% of its gross national product. "Not only must
Canada pay a large premium for attracting foreign capital,
but the value of its dollar can also be significantly
affected by the whims of foreign investors," Mr. Leith says.

   Trade Economic Aid for Soviet Arms Cuts

   The accelerating economic collapse of the Soviet Union
presents an unprecedented opportunity for the U.S. and its
allies to obtain a major reduction in Soviet military
capacity in exchange for massive economic aid. At the Houston
summit meeting, President Bush and the other Western leaders
should agree on a general strategy for tying any economic aid
for the Soviets to a reduction of Soviet arms.
   The alternative approaches that are now being considered
-- giving aid without any strings attached or conditioning it
only on such things as Soviet economic reforms and relations
with Lithuania -- would miss a major opportunity to improve
the prospects for world peace. So too would a decision simply
to deny aid and therefore pass up the chance to trade Western
consumer goods for Soviet military cuts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the recent Washington summit meeting between
President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev exuded warm feelings, it
did little to reduce the Soviet military threat. Even after
the agreed arms reductions, the Soviets will still have
massive destructive strength, including more than 5,000
ballistic missiles and 2,000 strategic bomber weapons. Mr.
Gorbachev and the other Soviet negotiators have been
unwilling to accept further cuts in strategic weapons or to
resolve the threat of conventional armed forces in Europe.
   The obvious lesson is that the Soviet Union is not
prepared to give up substantial additional offensive military
capacity in exchange for parallel military reductions by the
U.S. The Soviet leadership has presumably concluded that the
risk that the U.S. or NATO will attack the Soviet Union is
extremely low. Since reducing that risk further is of little
value to the Soviets, they are unwilling to make significant
further military concessions in exchange.
   What the Soviets really want is not reduced U.S. military
capacity but current consumer goods and access to the
technology, the advice and the investments that will permit
them to develop a Western standard of living. It is a
mistake, therefore, to limit arms negotiations to military
trade-offs alone. More generally, it is wrong to regard the
Soviet Union in arms negotiations as a power like the U.S.
when, despite its formidable military capacity, its economy
is on the verge of collapse. The proper focus for U.S.
negotiations with the Soviet Union should now be on trading
American consumer goods and know-how for Soviet military
reductions.
   This proposal to trade economic assistance for arms
reductions is very different from the call for unilateral
Western aid modeled on the Marshall Plan. The advocates of
such aid -- like French President Francois Mitterrand and
many others in Europe and the U.S. -- point to the success of
the Marshall plan in securing economic growth and democracy,
not only in the countries of Western Europe that had been our
allies in World War II but also in the defeated Germany. They
argue, moreover, that the recent collapse of the Warsaw Pact
and the Soviet recognition that the communist economic system
has failed now represent a psychological defeat for the
Soviet Union that could lead to the same kind of poisoned
atmosphere in the Soviet Union that prevailed in Weimar
Germany after World War I but that was avoided by the
Marshall Plan aid to Germany after the Second World War.
   American opponents of aid to the Soviet Union rightly
stress that the Soviet situation today is very different from
that in Europe after World War II. The Soviets lack the
tradition of capitalism that made the Marshall Plan so
successful in Western Europe. Even more important, although
the Soviet Union may appear on the surface like a defeated
enemy, there has been nothing analogous to Germany's
unconditional surrender. The Soviet Union is still a
formidable military adversary with massive nuclear
destructive capacity.
   Of course, that is a case against unconditional economic
assistance to the Soviet Union or assistance conditioned only
on economic and political actions by the Soviets. It is not a
case against using economic assistance as a way of getting
the Soviets to accept a reduction of their relative military
strength.
   Similarly, the argument that Western economic assistance
may not help the Soviets to reform their economy is not
relevant if the Soviets will accept such aid as an inducement
to reduce their military strength. Even if much of the aid is
wasted from an economic point of view, it will be valuable
for the U.S. if it achieves a better military balance.
   The American goal should be to secure as much of a
reduction in Soviet military strength -- particularly nuclear
weapons and intercontinental delivery capacity -- as possible
in exchange for our consumer goods and technical assistance.
The closer that the Soviets are prepared to get to complete
elimination of their offensive intercontinental nuclear
capacity, the more the U.S. should be prepared to give in
consumer goods and related technology.
   The U.S. has a clear and vital interest in reducing Soviet
military capacity, especially the ability to deliver a
nuclear attack on the U.S. The presumably peaceful intentions
of Mr. Gorbachev provide little comfort, since we cannot know
how long he will remain in a position of power or what kind
of individual will succeed him.
   There is also an increasing probability that the Soviet
Union itself will not survive the current decade but will
divide into a group of separate affiliated republics.
Advocates of national self-determination may cheer the notion
of separate governments for the Baltic states, for the
Ukraine, for Georgia, for Azerbaijan, and for the Russian
Republic. But who can help but be nervous about the prospect
that the nuclear weapons now spread around the Soviet Union
will no longer be controlled by a single Soviet government?
   Uncertainties about the future leadership of the Soviet
Union and about its very existence are the current basis of
America's very real interest in negotiating Soviet arms cuts.
These same concerns should support using economic aid to
achieve a reduced Soviet military capacity.
   Some opponents of economic aid to the Soviets argue that
the U.S. cannot afford substantial spending on such aid at a
time when large budget deficits persist and may become
increasingly difficult to finance because of a reduced
availability of capital from abroad. But after spending
trillions of dollars on defense in the past decade to achieve
military parity with the Soviets, it would now be foolish not
to spend a few tens of billions of dollars if that could buy
clear military superiority and a reduction in the overall
risk of military conflict.
   Moreover, if we do succeed in inducing the Soviets to
reduce their nuclear capability substantially, the U.S. could
reduce defense spending and still have a military
superiority. The more that the Soviets are willing to reduce
their international nuclear capability in exchange for
consumer goods and technical assistance, the more that the
U.S. can safely reduce its own military spending. To a
significant extent, consumer aid to the Soviet Union can thus
be self-financing through the reduced U.S. military spending
that it permits. Indeed, if consumer aid buys a large enough
reduction in Soviet military strength, the overall peace
dividend could even be larger than currently projected.
   The reduction in U.S. military spending will also make it
easier for the Soviet political leaders to persuade their own
military hierarchy to accept a cutback in Soviet military
spending. Although the real essence of the agreement is the
reduction of Soviet military spending in exchange for
American economic aid, wrapping these in the same package
with additional U.S. arms reductions will permit the Soviet
leaders to accept the proposal without the loss of face that
would be associated with reducing their military strength
unilaterally in exchange for economic assistance. From our
own point of view, the critical fact would be that the Soviet
military cutbacks would exceed our own, leading to U.S.
military superiority and greater global stability.
   A trade of Western economic assistance for Soviet arms
reductions should appeal to a broad political spectrum in the
U.S. and its allies. Supporters should include those who want
to assist the Soviets on humanitarian grounds, those who
believe that economic assistance will increase political
stability in the Soviet Union, those who want to increase
U.S. military strength relative to the Soviets by reducing
Soviet military capacity, and those who will welcome a
reduction in both U.S. and Soviet defense spending and
military capacity.
   There is of course no way to know how such an offer would
be received in the Soviet Union at this time. But the
collapse of the Soviet consumer economy and the internal
dissension that it is causing suggest that this is a good
time to present such an offer. Soviet economist Stanislav
Shatalin, recently appointed by President Gorbachev as a
member of his new presidential council, has stated
emphatically that the Soviet Union must run to the West for
massive economic assistance. And although it is still
publicly denied, Germany has apparently negotiated with the
Soviets a package of consumer assistance and credit aimed at
obtaining the Soviet Union's support of full German
participation in NATO and a timetable for the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from East Germany.
   If in their current dire economic circumstances the
Soviets do not agree to scrap a substantial portion of their
offensive weapons in exchange for massive economic aid, that
would be a sad but useful indication that they are really not
serious about abandoning their old goals of military
conquest. If that is so, we should learn it as soon as
possible. But if there is a chance for trading our consumer
goods for greater military security, it is an opportunity
that should not be lost.

   TARRYTOWN, N.Y. -- Andlinger &amp; Co. said it purchased Chase
Chemical Co. The price wasn't disclosed.
   The private investment firm's acquisition appears to
indicate that Chase Chemical will fare well in its legal
fight to introduce a generic version of Pfizer Inc.'s
blood-pressure drug Procardia, a hugely profitable product
with about $400 million in annual sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chase Chemical is a Newark, N.J., maker and marketer of
pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement products.
   Andlinger, said Chase Chemical is "well positioned in the
marketplace," and that Andlinger plans to "work closely with
management to help Chase capitalize upon its growth
potential."
   "We have developed a substantial drug and it seemed to be
an appropriate time to cash in," says Richard Remaly, a
partner in Chase Chemical and president and chief executive
officer of Chase Pharmaceutical Inc., which was formed by
Andlinger to acquire Chase Chemical.
   Closely held Andlinger has interests in numerous
companies, such as sunglass-maker Foster Grant Corp., with
combined sales of more than $1 billion.
   The Food and Drug Administration had given clearance to
Chase Chemical to sell nifedipine, its generic version of
Pfizer's drug. But Pfizer, which derives an estimated 15% of
its profit from Procardia, filed a patent-infringement suit
against Chase in February 1988 and delayed its introduction.
   A month after the suit was filed, Mr. Remaly participated
in a management buy-out of Chase Chemical. Organized by
Tweedy, Browne Co. L.P., New York, the management group paid
$14.5 million in cash and notes to Iroquois Brands Ltd.,
Greenwich, Conn., which took a charge of $900,000 on the
sale.
   Mr. Remaly says the company is "worth considerably more
today." He adds, "The potential for a generic Procardia is
enormous.'
   Officials for Pfizer, based in New York, couldn't be
reached for comment.

   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. is telling bankers that it
hopes to reset the interest rate on $2.6 billion of its most
troublesome high-yield junk bonds at 16 1/2%, perhaps as soon
as this summer.
   The estimate -- which still has to win investment bankers'
approval -- shows how much the tobacco and food company
believes its giant refinancing plan should improve its
creditworthiness. A month ago, bond-market specialists
estimated that RJR would have to accept a rate of 20% or
higher, if those bonds' interest rate could be successfully
reset at all.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As previously reported, RJR has begun a $5.3 billion
effort to reshape its balance sheet. RJR and its major
shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., plan to inject
new bank loans, preferred stock and equity into the company,
while retiring potentially high-cost junk bonds. News of
RJR's plan has sent its junk bonds soaring nearly 20% the
past month, to about 82 cents on the dollar.
   Bankers say RJR aims to retire all of its $2.18 billion of
14.07% convertible reset bonds due 2009 and $1.95 billion, or
about 45%, of its 14.07% reset bonds due 2007. Those reset
bonds have threatened to create a financial crisis for RJR,
because their interest rates must be reset by next April so
that the bonds trade at full face value. The bonds have
traded as low as 58 cents on the dollar this year, suggesting
that RJR could be forced to pay a ruinously high interest
rate to meet its reset obligations.
   Even after its refinancing plan, RJR plans to leave about
$2.6 billion of its reset bonds of 2007 outstanding, bankers
say. Those are the bonds that RJR hopes to reset at a 16.5%
interest rate, the bankers add.
   Some bondholders are optimistic about RJR's chances of
success. "The reset is starting to look more doable," says
Lawrence Garshofsky, an arbitrager at Kayne Anderson &amp; Co.,
Los Angeles, which owns some RJR bonds. "If they can complete
it, that bodes well for RJR's financial health."
   But an executive at a major bank lender to RJR cautions
that the 16.5% reset rate is just a "ballpark figure" that
could change. For one thing, he says, a major change in U.S.
interest rates would disrupt RJR's calculations. So would any
difficulties in putting the refinancing package together, or
a downturn in RJR's basic businesses.
   Furthermore, the exact reset rate won't be determined by
RJR. The company's investment bankers, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., are scheduled to confer with two
independent Wall Street firms, Lazard Freres &amp; Co. and Dillon
Read &amp; Co., to set the reset rate. If they can't agree, a
fifth Wall Street firm will pick a rate between the ones they
decide on.
   Dillon Read vows it won't be pushed around by giant RJR
and KKR. "Our job is to set the rate on the debentures," said
Fritz Hobbs, an investment banker at Dillon Read. Those
duties are "pretty clearly defined. And I don't know yet
what's going to happen."

   High Court Had Billion-Dollar Impact

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court justices grappled with
real-world business issues in the term that ended yesterday,
and their rulings had an immediate impact on billions of
dollars of corporate funds as well as state and federal
government tax revenue.
   "The impact of the court's decisions this term has been
far more acute in the economic world than at any time in
memory," says Bruce Fein, a Washington lawyer and
conservative legal columnist.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The court's 129 decisions in the term that began last
October had a significant monetary effect in three business
areas: federal pension regulation, state and federal
taxation, and antitrust law.
   The court is accustomed to deciding legal issues without
much concern for the impact on daily business transactions.
Warren Burger, who retired as chief justice in 1986, was the
last justice to openly worry about how the release of certain
decisions might affect trading in particular stocks.
   But, according to Mr. Fein, the court handled this term's
high stakes issues well. "On economic issues, the court is
far more sophisticated than in previous years as to how
businesses operate," he says.
   The early indications are that major decisions affecting
business will continue next term. The court already has
agreed to decide whether the Constitution's "due process"
guarantee requires limits on the amount of punitive damage
awards in civil lawsuits. And the justices will decide
whether federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination in
employment prevent companies from barring women of
child-bearing age from some hazardous jobs.
   In the pension case, the court upheld the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp.'s authority to get tough with companies that
are looking to bail out on big, troubled pension plans. The
court upheld the PBGC's order to LTV Corp. to reassume
liability for more than $2 billion in pension benefits that
the company stopped funding in 1987 when it filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   The ruling immediately restored some stability to the
PBGC, a federal insurance corporation that is operating with
a $1 billion deficit. The PBGC and industry analysts had
warned that a ruling against the agency would have encouraged
numerous other troubled companies in the steel, auto and
airline industries to adopt similar tactics to cut their
losses. This would have driven the PBGC deficit up to $7.8
billion, agency officials said, and almost certainly would
have required a congressional bailout.
   "I think the court looked at the S&amp;L situation and said
we're not going to have a bailout saddled on us," says Mr.
Fein.
   But if the PBGC case averted having billions of dollars in
liability change hands, the high court's tax decisions
produced an immediate upheaval. The court ruled that states
must provide refunds to taxpayers who were required to pay
taxes that the state should have known, on the basis of
existing court precedents or federal laws, were
unconstitutional.
   State taxing officials have estimated that states face
potential refunds of $6.5 billion in cases in which taxes
already have been declared unconstitutional or in lawsuits
that are pending. In at least 24 states, for example, refund
lawsuits totaling $2 billion have been filed over
unconstitutional state taxation of the pensions of retired
federal workers. The high court has said the states can't tax
federal pensions while exempting those of state and local
retirees.
   In a federal tax decision, the justices ruled on a foreign
tax-credit issue that could have cost the government $900
million in corporate tax refunds if the Internal Revenue
Service had lost. Siding with the IRS, however, the court
said the legal definition of taxable accumulated profits for
multinational companies should be based on U.S. law, not on
deductions allowed by foreign governments.
   On federal antitrust issues, the court changed the way
companies must go about seeking government approval for
mergers. In the past, companies proposing takeovers were able
to ignore state attorneys general and negotiate only with
federal officials, who have been generally favorably disposed
to mergers. By ruling that states may sue in federal court to
seek to dismantle anti-competitive mergers, the justices
forced companies to clear their deals in advance with state
attorneys general or risk court-ordered divestiture.
   In the business world, however, cases that the court
refuses to hear often have an impact, too. That was
especially true this term in the area of securities law.
   The justices let stand a federal appeals court ruling
barring the Securities and Exchange Commission from approving
trading of new stock "basket" products that allow investors
to trade a cross-section of the stock market. The justices
also let stand an appeals court ruling barring Massachusetts
from interfering with the standard arbitration agreements
that brokerages require customers to sign. And the high court
left intact an appeals court ruling upholding a Wisconsin
securities law that imposes significant procedural hurdles on
hostile tender offers.

   Over-the-counter stocks edged higher in selective, quiet
trading.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.51 to 456.89, a 0.33%
gain, as volume rose to 137.5 million shares from 131.6
million Wednesday. Advancing issues overtook declining
stocks, 957 to 932.

<TEXT>
   Trading was quiet at Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in Memphis,
Tenn., according to Larry Shipman, a senior OTC trader there.
Most of the activity was confined to small investors who
traded shares of regional companies, he said. For example,
shares of Durr-Fillauer Medical, a Montgomery, Ala., maker of
medical and surgical supplies, rose 1/4 to 24 1/4.
   JSB Financial, the day's most-active stock, rose 2 3/4 to
12 3/4 on 4.5 million shares. The New York concern converted
to a stock savings bank from a mutual savings bank through a
16-million share offering priced at $10 a share.
   Laidlaw Class B shares fell 3/8 to 21 3/4 on nearly 4.5
million shares. The Canadian waste management and
transportation concern said it earned 30 cents a share in the
third quarter ended in May, compared with 25 cents a year
earlier. Chairman and chief executive officer Michael G.
Degroote announced he will resign Aug. 1 as chief executive.
   3Com, among the day's most-active stocks, rose 3/4 to 16
3/4 on 1.2 million shares. Late Tuesday, the Santa Clara,
Calif., computer-networking company reported net income for
the fourth quarter ended May 31 of 25 cents a share, down
from 28 cents a year earlier. The most recent quarter
included a one-time, relocation expense of five cents a
share. Without that expense, 3Com's quarterly earned more
than expected, data communications analyst Don Rode of
Soundview Financial Group, Stamford, Conn., said in an
interview.
   Vicor surged 2 to 15 1/4. Tuesday, the Andover, Mass.,
power supply company filed for a one-million share stock
offering. Vicor chief financial officer Thomas St. Germain
told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that a brief
profile of the company in the latest edition of Barron's and
the planned stock offering apparently contributed to interest
in the stock.
   Old Stone added 1/2 to 9 1/4. Late Tuesday, the
Providence, R.I., bank declared a regular quarterly dividend
of 39 cents a share.
   Micro Healthsystems jumped 1 5/8 to 13 3/4 after the West
Orange, N.J., health-services company said it expects to
report net income for the first quarter ending June 30 of 20
cents a share, up sharply from 12 cents a year earlier.
   Immunex surged 2 1/4 to 28 1/4. Alan D. Frazier, chief
financial officer of the Seattle biotechnology concern, told
DJPIR he was notified yesterday that on July 31 a Food and
Drug Administration advisory panel will review data on
Immunex's GMCSF drug.
   Intermetrics fell 5/8 to 1 3/4 after the Cambridge, Mass.,
computer software concern reported net income for the first
quarter ended May 31 of 14 cents a share, down from 17 cents
a year earlier.
   Sage Software tumbled 2 to 13 7/8 after the Rockville,
Md., maker of software tools reported net income for the
fourth quarter ended April 30 of 22 cents a share, up from
four cents a year earlier. One analyst had estimated the
company would earn 25 cents a share in the fourth quarter,
according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
   Western Financial slid 5/8 to 1 3/4. Late Tuesday, the
Overland Park, Kan., thrift said the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. may require its principal unit, Columbia
Savings Association, to take "material" additional write-offs
to provide for additional allowances for loan and real estate
losses.

   NASDAQ GOES INTERNATIONAL: As expected, yesterday, the
National Association of Securities Dealers asked the
Securities and Exchange Commission to approve an expanded
12-hour trading day. It would allow London dealers to trade
certain over-the-counter and exchange listed stocks on
Nasdaq, NASD's electronic trading system. The proposed system
also will allow U.S. market makers to participate in the
London trading day.
   In a filing with the SEC, NASD sought approval of its
proposed Nasdaq International Service, which it hopes to
start by mid-September. Under the system, trading will begin
on both sides of the Atlantic at 3:30 a.m. Eastern Time,
concurrent with the opening of the London Stock Exchange. At
9 a.m. Eastern time, trading over the system will halt to
allow dissemination summaries of European trading activity.
At 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, the system will reopen for trading
with the U.S. session.
   All National Market System securities are eligible for
trading on the system. Also, non-Canadian foreign securities
or American depositary receipts that are included in Nasdaq
are eligible. So are all other stocks listed and registered
on a national securities exchange, including the New York
Stock Exchange. NASD said it expects the system to handle
trading in about 400 to 500 securities.

   Money Fund Yields
   Were Unchanged
   In Latest Week

   Investors took some of their cash out of money market
mutual funds in the latest week, as yields didn't budge.
   The average seven-day compound yield, which assumes
reinvestment of dividends, remained at 7.96%, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Assets of the 431 taxable
funds tracked by the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter
slipped by $611 million to $378.9 billion in the week ended
Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of the withdrawals were from funds open only to
institutions, said Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's.
She said some of that cash may have been invested directly in
short-term Treasury securities. Yields on Treasury bills sold
at Monday's auction were about a tenth of a percentage point
higher than on the average money fund.
   Money funds invest in such things as Treasury bills,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit. Average maturity of the funds'
investments remained at 44 days, indicating no substantial
change in yields any time soon.
   Average maturity has been 43 or 44 days for nearly three
months. The average seven-day compound yield has been at or
slightly below 8% since late January.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
remained at 7.67%. The average 30-day simple yield again was
7.67% and the average 30-day compound yield stayed at 7.96%
for the second consecutive week.
   Yields on tax-exempt funds rose slightly, although assets
fell. The average seven-day compound yield of the tax-free
funds, for instance, increased to 5.45% from 5.40%. That's
equivalent to 7.57% for someone in the 28% tax bracket and to
8.13% for those paying 33% in taxes.
   Assets of 222 tax-exempt funds declined to $75.9 billion
from $76.1 billion. Average maturity lengthened to 43 days
from 40.

   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., citing
lower equipment sales and the costly startup of its new
credit card, said second-quarter earnings will likely fall
below those in the year-earlier quarter.
   AT&amp;T's announcement knocked the wind out of the company's
stock and led analysts to lower their estimates for the
second quarter, as well as full-year forecasts for 1990 and
1991. Many also downgraded AT&amp;T stock to "hold" from "buy."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AT&amp;T fell $2.125 to $39.125 on volume of 11.5 million shares,
making the stock the most-active Big Board issue yesterday.
AT&amp;T's normal daily volume is 1.8 million shares. The decline
also lopped about $2.34 billion off AT&amp;T's market
capitalization, given the company's nearly 1.1 billion shares
outstanding.
   While AT&amp;T said second-quarter earnings will probably be
lower than the $699 million, or 65 cents a share, in the 1989
period, the company still expects 1990 earnings to surpass
1989's profit of $2.7 billion, or $2.50 a share.
   "We expect to have a record year this year in terms of
earnings and our objective continues to be a mininum 10% to
12% {annual} increase in earnings," said Morris Tanenbaum,
AT&amp;T vice chairman and chief financial officer. While "we
think it will be difficult to hit our objective, we will make
every effort to do that."
   AT&amp;T's profit problem underscores the magnitude of
Chairman Robert E. Allen's high-wire challenge at AT&amp;T. His
campaign to slash costs, refine AT&amp;T's management structure
and protect the company's "golden-goose" long-distance
business has been highly successful. AT&amp;T had record profit
in 1989, and the company recently boosted its dividend for
the first time since the court-ordered breakup in January
1984.
   However, problems in AT&amp;T's office phone systems and
computer businesses continue to drain profits. Also,
potentially lucrative ventures such as credit cards and
international businesses are demanding huge start-up funds
and are years away from delivering the kinds of profits that
can offset losses elsewhere.
   Analysts were quick to point out that AT&amp;T's problem in
the second quarter doesn't portend a calamity. "This is far,
far, far from being any kind of a catastrophe," said Jack B.
Grubman, telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. "If
there's a silver lining in this news it is that the core
business, long-distance, is healthy as ever. . . . And while
the new credit card will cause short-term blips in earnings,
AT&amp;T has been signing up a boat load more customers than it
thought it would by now, meaning it will reach critical mass
to make money faster."
   AT&amp;T has signed up more than two million cardholders --
even after rejecting 40% of all applicants, notes Mr.
Grubman. The company recently said purchases with its
Universal MasterCard and Visa cards totaled more than $100
million, excluding revenue from phone call charges.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Grubman lowered his per-share estimates
for the second quarter to 58 cents from 72 cents, and to
$2.65 for 1990 from $2.90. For 1991, he now expects AT&amp;T to
earn $2.95 a share instead of $3.40. Mr. Grubman was one of
several analysts who cut his recommendation to a "hold" from
a "buy."
   "Investors have been paying a hefty premium {based on}
AT&amp;T's long-distance business," said Robert B. Morris III, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs. The announcement "refocuses the
market's attention on AT&amp;T's exposure to product life-cycles
and the economy {in addition to being} just a long-distance
company."
   Mr. Morris, who has had AT&amp;T stock as a "hold" for the
past six months, lowered his second-quarter per-share
estimate to 60 cents from 72 cents, and cut his forecast for
1990 to $2.60 a share from $2.80. For 1991, he expects AT&amp;T
to earn $3 a share, down from $3.15 a share.
   In the first quarter, AT&amp;T's revenue from product sales,
including telephone and computer equipment, increased 1.2% to
$2.72 billion. In 1989, equipment sales rose 1.7% to $11.5
billion, while profit margins flattened out and costs rose
6.1% to $6.97 billion.
   These numbers have led analysts to speculate that AT&amp;T
will have to dump some of its equipment businesses. Many have
long held AT&amp;T's communications equipment operations, which
include office phone switches and computers, to be
expendable. Mr. Grubman estimates that AT&amp;T's losses are $400
million to $500 million a year on business systems and $300
million on computers.
   "The equipment business basically stinks," said Mr.
Grubman. "AT&amp;T should take a look at exiting some of these
businesses."
   "A driving factor in PBX {office phone switch} sales is
company relocations," said George Kelly, an analyst at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. "When a company moves it usually buys a new
phone system, and with the real estate market down . . . this
is affecting AT&amp;T's sales."
   Mr. Tanenbaum said there are "absolutely no plans to exit
or sell" any of AT&amp;T's equipment businesses. And Mr. Allen
said: "Be assured, the anticipated lower second-quarter
earnings will not lead to any short term `fixes' that will
handicap the business over the long haul."

   Anti-Collusion Law Wasn't Written
   For Era of Computer Communications

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)
</GV>
<LP>
   Has airline pricing become so sophisticated that it
outstrips antitrust law?
   The country's cornerstone of antitrust legislation, the
1890 Sherman Act, was written to rein in the industrial
revolution's robber barons and monopolists. But the law may
be beginning to show some limitations as the information age
flowers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The airline industry is the leading case. It has poured
hundreds of millions of dollars into developing computer
systems that not only allow carriers to track millions of
reservations, but also, in essence, let them vote on whether
they will go along with fare increases or cuts, critics say.
   Antitrust specialists say that the only way to prove
collusion is to discover a secret agreement. In order to
prosecute a signalling case, the Justice Department has "a
long row to hoe," says Charles F. Rule, former assistant
attorney general of the Justice Department's antitrust
division.
   Years ago, the courts had a broader interpretation of what
constituted an agreement. In a case against American Tobacco
in the mid-1940s, the court ruled that an antitrust agreement
could be inferred when companies had a "meeting of the minds"
and were "working together understandably" to achieve a
common objective.
   In more recent years, the courts have narrowed their view.
In a 1974 case against General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co., the Sixth District Court in Michigan ruled that
companies could legally come to the same decision
independently based on competitive reasons. It held that
companies are acting legally as long as their actions are
"consistent with rational business behaviour and prevailing
economic conditions."
   Also, the court ruled that it isn't illegal for a company
to raise its prices in the hope that the action will prompt
competitors to "go further or for the purpose of testing the
marketplace to determine whether further unilateral action is
possible."
   When matching another carrier's fares, airlines say they
are doing so for "competitive reasons." That type of
behavior, the courts say, is "mere conscious parallelism."
   In another 1974 government case, this one against Du Pont,
the court said that the companies charged with price fixing
weren't guilty because they were able to defend their actions
with competitive explanations.
   Enforcement can be difficult even in cases that involve
direct contact. The Justice Department didn't get a guilty
verdict in the celebrated case in which American Airlines'
Robert Crandall used a telephone to propose a fare hike to
competitor Braniff. Instead, American settled the case
without denying or admitting guilt.
   In that case, Mr. Crandall told Howard Putnam, then
chairman of Braniff, that it was "dumb as hell" for the
carriers to pound each other with cutthroat low fares in
Dallas, according to a transcript of the conversation.

   DALLAS -- Don R. Dixon, former owner of the defunct Vernon
Savings &amp; Loan Association, pleaded innocent to charges that
he illegally used thrift funds to reimburse employees for
expenditures on political contributions and female escorts.
   Mr. Dixon's arraignment yesterday in federal court here
came one day after his former accountant was convicted of tax
fraud in connection with two loan transactions at Vernon
Savings. One transaction involved the financing of the yacht
"High Spirits," a vessel that was based in Washington, D.C.,
and frequented by congressmen, thrift executives and
lobbyists.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The accountant, Wellington O. Rothwell, was convicted late
Tuesday by a federal jury here on eight charges. His
investment partner, real estate salesman Rosswell H.
Westmoreland, was convicted of three charges. The charges
against both men, which included conspiracy, attempted tax
evasion and subscribing to false tax returns, were based on
the concealment of taxable commissions earned by Messrs.
Rothwell and Westmoreland in connection with the two Vernon
loan transactions.
   Defense attorneys Barry Sorrels and Gary Udashen indicated
in court that they would ask for a new trial on behalf of
their clients, who are scheduled for sentencing Aug. 2. Mr.
Rothwell, 55 years old, faces a maximum possible sentence of
30 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine. Mr.
Westmoreland, 42, could receive a maximum sentence of 13
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Mr. Dixon, who was indicted earlier this month, is
scheduled for trial Aug. 20 before U.S. District Judge A. Joe
Fish here. Mr. Dixon is charged with 38 separate counts
related to the allegedly improper reimbursement of Vernon
employees' expenditures for political contributions and
female escorts on thrift junkets. The charges aren't related
to those against Messrs. Rothwell and Westmoreland.
   Federal thrift regulators took control of Vernon Savings
in 1987 and found that as much as 96% of its $1.2
billion-plus loan portfolio was in default.

   HOUSTON -- Sysco Corp. said the Justice Department
launched a probe of possible bid-rigging involving several
companies, including Sysco, which all provide food services
to southeast Texas schools.
   The big food-service concern said the investigation
involves its Sysco Food Services Inc. subsidiary, which
distributes food and related products to schools and other
organizations in the Houston area. The company said the unit
received a subpoena from a federal grand jury here about five
weeks ago requesting certain records.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sysco said it complied fully and opened an internal
investigation as well. It said it also offered to compensate
customers for any overcharges should the allegations prove
true.
   "Sysco has always prided itself on being a corporation
whose entire family of companies is committed to ethical and
lawful business practices," said John F. Woodhouse, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   Analysts and company officials said the amount of money
involved is likely to be minimal. Sysco said that the unit
accounts for just 3% of total company revenue and that the
unit's public-schools business accounts for 7% of its sales
volume.
   The stock market appeared to be unconcerned about the
probe. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Sysco shares closed at $35, up $1.375.
   It couldn't be learned which other food-service companies
have been targeted by the probe.
   An official with the U.S. attorney's office here confirmed
the investigation but wouldn't elaborate.

   Allianz AG Buys
   East Germany's
   Dominant Insurer

   WEST BERLIN -- Allianz AG of West Germany, outflanking a
last-minute rival bid by domestic competitors, said it signed
final contracts giving it a 51% stake in East Germany's state
insurance monopoly for 270.7 million marks ($163.1 million)
in cash.
   Announcing the pact yesterday, the day after it was
signed, Allianz said the transaction "provides the conditions
for the venture to begin business operations" in East Germany
on Sunday -- the day the two Germanys are to link their
monetary and social institutions to form one German economy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   East Berlin's public trust for East German industry, or
Treuhandanstalt, will retain a 49% interest in the new
venture, called Deutsche Versicherungs-AG. But Allianz said
its controlling interest gives it the right of first refusal
should Treuhandanstalt ever decide to sell.
   The controversial transaction gives Europe's largest
insurance group a dominating position in the East German
market. In disclosing its intention of taking even a lesser
49% stake in Deutsche Versicherungs in March, Allianz
triggered howls of protest from other West German insurance
groups, angered over the prospect of Allianz achieving a
quick monopoly in East Germany before they could build their
own East German operations.
   West German antitrust authorities said the case affected
only the East German market, and thus was outside their
jurisdiction.
   On Tuesday, the day Allianz signed contracts with the East
German government, a group of five other West German insurers
led by Colonia Versicherungs in Cologne announced a
counteroffer for the East German insurance network. Promising
to pay the same price as Allianz, the group vowed to break up
the former monopoly into regional insurance groups.
   But, said an Allianz official yesterday: "Their offer has
been overtaken by events."
   Allianz's successful sweep into East Germany leaves other
West German insurers infuriated at having to start from
scratch. Colonia spokesman Norbert Kampf said that even some
East German officials had warned the Allianz takeover gives
the Munich-based group a dominating share in a market of 16
million inhabitants.
   "Allianz's position will be reduced in time, as other
insurance companies set up their own operations. But even a
25% or 30% market share is very high in the insurance
business," Mr. Kampf contended.
   Allianz sought to defuse criticism by citing the approval
of East German authorities, who also promised to throw open
the market to other insurance companies after Germany's
economic merger on Sunday.

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, now firmly headed in a
conservative direction, covered a broad range of issues

   -- States can't require that both parents be notified
before a minor has an abortion, unless they also provide for
a court hearing for those who don't want to inform their
families. (Hodgson vs. Minnesota, 54) But states may require
that one parent be told. It is unclear, however, whether such
a law also requires a court hearing procedure. (Ohio vs.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 6-3)
   -- Though the Constitution apparently protects the right
to die, states may require clear evidence that a patient in a
vegetative condition wishes to die before cutting off food
and water; the state need not heed a family's wishes to allow
the patient to die. (Cruzan vs. Director, Missouri Department

federal government's expenses in resolving the claims. (U.S.

   -- The First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom
doesn't mean a state must excuse individuals from complying

student religious groups the same access to scheduling and
facilities that other extracurricular activities receive.

sales tax on religious materials they sell. (Swaggart

   CONSOLIDATED FREIGHTWAYS Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) --
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on
senior debt of this transportation company. The rating
concern said its action affects about $275 million in
long-term debt. Separately, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it
put on its CreditWatch list with negative implications $425
million of Consolidated Freightways' debt. Moody's lowered
its ratings on the company's senior debt to Baa-3 from
single-A-3 and on commercial paper to prime-3 from prime-2,
citing reduced financial flexibility, a difficult operating
environment, and diminished bondholder protection in light of
a proposed senior bank credit agreement. Continuing losses at
Consolidated Freightways' Emery Worldwide unit also were a
factor in the rating change, Moody's said. S&amp;P placed on
Creditwatch the company's senior debt and industrial revenue
bonds, rated triple-B, and commercial paper, rated
single-A-2. S&amp;P also cited Emery's losses and the new bank
credit facility, as well as continuing poor prospects for a
profit turnaround. The diversified company has operations in
trucking and air freight.

   COOPER COS. (New York) -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered
its rating on $79 million of subordinated debt to
triple-C-plus from single-B and removed Cooper from its
CreditWatch list. S&amp;P said the downgrade reflects the
"uncertain nature" of planned acquisitions. It said the
company has reduced debt and created a $180 million pool of
liquid investments by divesting itself of most operating
assets. The ratings agency said the remaining businesses, a
small contact lens unit and a cryosurgical equipment unit,
could provide a base for re-entry into the eye-care market.
   ---
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
downgraded its rating on this city's $76.9 million of general
obligation bonds to Baa-1 from single-A. The rating concern
attributed its action to the "rapid weakening of the city's
financial position since fiscal year 1988," which caused "a
significant projected fiscal year-end 1990 general fund
deficit." Moody's also cited "the slowing regional economy,
large capital needs and below-average socioeconomic base."

   Berkowitz Paints Brighter Future
   For Children in Chicago Ghetto

   STEVEN BERKOWITZ, A CHICAGO BUSINESSMAN and art buff, now
spends his time and money helping talented ghetto children
graduate from graffiti to careers in the visual arts.
   Three years ago, at age 45, Mr. Berkowitz sold his $60
million-a-year Christmas ornament business to Alco Standard.
He stayed on as chairman but, relieved of day-to-day chores,
gained time for what he calls his "passion for art." Already
a collector, he opened an art gallery. To work with children,
another passion, he created the Marwen Foundation (named for
his two daughters, Marcy and Wendy).
   By March 1988, Marwen was ready to start its pilot program
of free after-school art classes in community centers around
Chicago. By September, the foundation had added internships
and, a year later, art scholarships. Advertising agencies
like Leo Burnett, Chicago museums, galleries and individual
artists took on Marwen interns for paid summer jobs. Nine
advanced students are now lined up for four-year,
college-level art schools.
   Since starting, the foundation has worked with 2,900
children, ranging in age from five to 19, and the Marwen
annual budget has grown to $250,000 from $80,000. Mr.
Berkowitz originally picked up the whole tab but this year he
will pay half. The rest will come from Illinois and Chicago
government art organizations, and from private individual and
corporate donors.
   The most visible creations of the young Marwen artists are
street murals in downtown Chicago. These came about when
Robert Wislow, chairman of U.S. Equities, a Chicago
developer, invited Mr. Berkowitz to have his charges decorate
construction-site fences at two projects -- and to earn $3.50
an hour while doing it. Mr. Wislow had sat on school boards
with Mr. Berkowitz; Marwen's executive director, Diane
Fitzgerald, had taught art to Mr. Wislow's daughter.
   The first mural encloses the 85,000-square-foot site of
the Harold Washington Public Library, designed as the city's
main library. For this, the young artists filled 22
four-by-ten-foot panels  with scenes from Chicago life -- the
late Mayor Washington, basketball star Michael Jordan
stuffing a shot, etc. (When the library is finished, Diane
Fitzgerald hopes to auction the panels off.)
   A second gallery decorates the fences guarding Union
Station in the Loop, which Mr. Wislow's firm is restoring.
For this project, Marwen's artists created outsized portraits
of Chicago celebrities -- among them, coach Mike Ditka of the
Chicago Bears, Mayor Richard Daley and TV star Oprah Winfrey.
   Marwen's muralists have also just finished their first
permanent work, this one for Chicago's First National Bank.
The bank commissioned them to do a 95-foot panorama in the
city's Lincoln Park, site of the new branch bank that houses
it.
   Developer Wislow, who now sits on the Marwen board, was
awed at the way the young artists tackled the jobs. "They
came on with teams to boss the work, budget costs, research
the material, create concepts and working drawings, and
finally finish  the project. This was not just handing a kid
a paintbrush."
   Steven Berkowitz is naturally delighted that his
brainchild is now becoming a permanent part of the Chicago
scene. But he shys away from self-congratulations, recalling
instead a conversation with Ben Nunez, a Marwen student and
one of its scholarship candidates. When the philanthropist
told the young artist about Marwen's new planned college
scholarship program, Mr. Nunez replied politely but firmly:
"You owe it to us."

   Liberal Justices Are Losing Their Voice
   As Influence on Pivotal Decisions Fades

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Despite the Supreme Court's surprise support
for federal affirmative-action programs yesterday, the high
court's liberal wing was almost entirely neutralized in the
term just ended.
   The court's four liberal justices, who have combined
experience of 91 years on the high court, wrote only a
handful of important majority opinions. And many of those
either preserved current law or were on subjects, such as
business and regulatory issues, in which the court's deep
ideological division didn't play a role.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In this regard, though the composition of the court
remained unchanged, the latest term differed from the
previous one. The court clearly became more conservative in
the 1988-89 term, but the liberals were in the fight. They
were able to eke out an occasional victory and write some
significant opinions.
   This term, says Walter Dellinger, a professor at Duke
University Law School, with the possible exception of the
affirmative-action ruling, "There is not a single significant
case decided or written by the liberal justices in which
major new ground was broken.
   "In nearly every case that divides the court
ideologically, there are now five justices for a conservative
result," Mr. Dellinger adds. In case after case, the only
suspense was whether the sometimes disparate views of the
five conservatives would coalesce around a single rationale.
   For the liberals, who are among the court's most senior
members, this unusually passive role is a distinct change and
a frustrating one, according to court insiders. The liberal
wing consists of Justices William Brennan, 84 years old,
Thurgood Marshall, 81, Harry Blackmun, 81, and John Stevens,
70.
   Even some liberal victories this term were written by
others. It isn't uncommon, especially in closely divided 5-4
decisions, to assign the majority opinion to the justice who
is the least committed to the position, figuring that will
produce a narrow product acceptable to all five justices.
   That apparently was the strategy followed by Justice
Brennan in the important 5-4 ruling upholding the authority
of federal judges to require school districts to raise taxes
to pay for school desegregation. With Chief Justice William
Rehnquist in dissent, it fell to Justice Brennan as the
senior justice in the majority to decide who would write the
opinion. The assignment went to the usually conservative
Justice Byron White, who probably wrote a narrower opinion
than any of the liberals would have.
   The decision was one of the most important liberal
victories of the term. But it was a reaffirmation of federal
court power to correct civil rights violations, not a new or
expanded principle. Moreover, it wasn't written by the
liberals.
   To be sure, there were other liberal victories, but none
that recognized new constitutional rights and only a few that
expanded rights. Justice Brennan's opinion yesterday,
upholding two Federal Communications Commission preference
programs to aid minorities and women in obtaining broadcast
licenses, was a broad endorsement of federal affirmative
action. But the ruling, while unexpected, is an extension of
a 1980 Supreme Court decision.
   Similarly, Justice Marshall's opinion striking down North
Carolina's death penalty law was foreshadowed by an earlier
ruling. And Justice Brennan's decision striking down the
federal flag desecration law was based almost entirely on the
ruling a year ago invalidating the Texas flag law.
   The abortion issue provides a long-term illustration of
the pattern. Through most of the 1980s, a bare liberal
majority held back state efforts to restrict the right to
abortion. Now, for the second consecutive year, the liberal
wing had to content itself with rulings that upheld new state
restrictions, though the most severe aspects were struck
down.

   This chart shows the different voting blocs of five

some subjective judgements in cases in which the five votes
were achieved through multiple opinions.

   Dispute Over Call for Debate Among All Cubans
   Could Shift Washington's Policy Toward Havana

   MIAMI -- A violent dispute over a call for peaceful
dialogue among Cubans could shift the grounds of Washington's
policy toward Havana, dominated for decades by the concerns
of hard-line anti-Castro Cubans in the U.S.
   From a dilapidated mansion in Havana, the head of Cuba's
tiny human rights movement has called for debate among all
Cubans, including exiles and the government of Fidel Castro.
A dialogue is needed, says Gustavo Arcos, to find a way out
of the dead end at which Mr. Castro's communist revolution
has arrived.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Miami, Armando Valladares, the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, himself a
former political prisoner in Cuba, toured the city's
Spanish-language radio stations to condemn Mr. Arcos's plea
as "treason."
   But the U.S. State Department said Mr. Valladares, who is
an ambassador for a little more than six weeks a year, wasn't
speaking for the U.S. And U.S. diplomats in Havana reassured
Mr. Arcos of U.S. backing for his human rights efforts.
   Exile organizations and personalities in Miami have rushed
to take sides. The Cuban American National Foundation, which
has the most influence in Washington, strongly backs Mr.
Valladares. It's the latest brouhaha to shake this
Cuban-exile capital. But, say many Cuban experts, it is much
more important than it seems.
   The emergence of Mr. Arcos could lead to a change in
Washington's tough Cuban policy, dominated for years by the
voting power of nearly one million conservative Cubans, most
of them Republicans, in the key state of Florida.
   At issue is whether the U.S. will back Cuba's internal
opposition, as it has done in Eastern Europe, Nicaragua and
Chile, in a bid to bring democracy to the island, or whether
U.S. policy will continue to be dominated by exile groups.
Mr. Valladares speaks for the exiles, who fear that after 30
years in the anti-Castro trenches they may be left out in the
cold if Cuba joins the march away from communism.
   Havana's response has been mixed. First, a deputy foreign
minister called the dispute a power struggle between
traitors. But on Tuesday another top official said Cuba was
ready to talk with "dissidents and discontents" but not with
the Miami exiles. President Bush told Hispanic journalists in
Washington Tuesday that he would welcome exile talks with Mr.
Castro if the exile community so desired.
   For a quarter century, U.S. policy has aimed to punish the
Castro regime rather than replace it, says Harvard
Cubanologist Jorge Dominguez. But the Castro government is
good at keeping dissent in check during hard times, he says,
and despite increasing hardships, the regime isn't about to
fade away.
   "Democracies don't happen," says Mr. Dominguez. "They have
to be made."
   Mr. Dominguez says the collapse of communist regimes in
Eastern Europe shows that dialogue between opposition and
government was a key factor in bringing about a democratic
transition everywhere but in Romania and Bulgaria. "Arcos's
strategy isn't crazy," says Mr. Dominguez. "It leads to
victory."
   Carlos Alberto Montaner, an influential exile writer
living in Spain, says some Cuban exiles don't realize that
most of the gains in Eastern Europe were obtained through
negotiation. "The same thing could happen in Cuba," he says.
   Mr. Arcos's background makes him a potential mediator. He
has credentials as a revolutionary and courageous opponent of
the Castro government. Some exiles think he could play a key
role in a post-Castro transition. Now dismissed by Havana as
a traitor, the same epithet used by Mr. Valladares, Mr. Arcos
was Mr. Castro's companion-in-arms against dictator Fulgencio
Batista. After Mr. Castro's triumph, Mr. Arcos was ambassador
to Belgium but became disenchanted with the revolution and
was imprisoned, off and on, for 10 years.
   Mr. Arcos's call for discussions has been backed by the
international Christian Democratic organization. The Latin
American Workers' Central, a 12 million-member labor
confederation aligned internationally with the Christian
Democratic movement, has asked Poland's Lech Walesa to
nominate Mr. Arcos for the Nobel Peace Prize. Other
parliamentary groups in Latin America and Europe are also
working for his nomination.
   Lisandro Perez, a sociologist at Florida International
University, says Mr. Valladares's attacks on Mr. Arcos are
more understandable when another lesson from Eastern Europe
is drawn: exile communities had little to do with the
collapse of those regimes.
   "Groups outside of Cuba have to be jealous," says Mr.
Perez. "In the sense that if Arcos's project is successful,
then it will exclude exile proponents of continuing Cuba's
isolation."
   Emotions are running high. Recently in Miami, a bomb
heavily damaged a museum associated with exiles thought to
favor a dialogue with Mr. Castro. Also, radio station WQBA
fired a commentator and terminated a contract with two
researchers, all human rights advocates supporting Mr. Arcos.
The three say the station gave in to political pressure,
which the station strongly denies.
   Mr. Perez warns that the bomb that damaged the museum
might be the first of many. "As a segment of the exile
community becomes more isolated, terrorism will increase in
Miami."

   Agreement to Sell
   Property Collapses

   Landmark Land Co.'s problems deepened when developer Barry
G. Hon terminated a previously announced agreement to buy one
of Landmark's California developments for $275 million.
   Landmark, of Carmel, Calif., declined to say why the
contract had been terminated; Mr. Hon couldn't be reached for
comment.

<TEXT>
   The plan had been the latest in a series of attempts by
Landmark to divest itself of real estate held by its Oak Tree
Savings Bank unit. Landmark has been under pressure to boost
Oak Tree's capital position to comply with increased capital
requirements of the Financial Institutions Reform and
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA.
   Separately, Landmark said that the federal Office of
Thrift Supervision ruled that the Oak Tree thrift must boost
"general and specific reserves" by $47.5 million. The real
estate concern said that at least $30 million of these
reserves relate to Oak Tree's loans outstanding for the La
Quinta Hotel resort in Southern California.
   Landmark said it was considering appealing the reserve
ruling; the company said it has obtained appraisals from two
national concerns that indicate the value of La Quinta
properties far exceeds Oak Tree's loan exposure. Nonetheless,
the OTS determination means that Oak Tree technically doesn't
meet all of the capital tests established by FIRREA and is
subject to "certain growth restrictions," according to
Landmark. These restrictions include the renewal or
acceptance of brokered deposits, without regulatory approval,
the company added.
   Oak Tree, within 60 days, must also submit a plan to
regulatory agencies outlining how it will meet capital
requirements in the future, according to Landmark. In the
interim, Oak Tree's "status as a federally insured
institution remains unaffected," the company said.
   Landmark last month said it had retained Salomon Brothers
Inc. to find "a strategic partner or asset purchaser" for
Landmark. In April, Landmark thought it had solved its
problems when it struck an initial agreement to sell to Mr.
Hon, a Southern California developer, all of its real estate
holdings for $967 million. But that plan unraveled after
federal regulators objected to provisions under which New
Orleans-based Oak Tree would have provided 75% of the
financing for the purchase. Regulators said the move would
have committed more than 20% of Oak Tree's assets to a single
borrower.
   Landmark is a thinly traded real estate concern 28% owned
by its chairman, Gerald G. Barton, and 24% owned by Olympia &amp;
York Developments Ltd., a Toronto conglomerate controlled by
the Reichmann brothers. In American Stock Exchange trading
yesterday, Landmark closed at $8.125, off 37.5 cents.

   Air travelers have saved millions of dollars as a result
of airline deregulation. But there is mounting concern that
airlines are resorting to sophisticated and illegal tactics
to subvert the fare competition that deregulation had
encouraged.
   The Justice Department has begun four separate
investigations of possible antitrust violations in the
industry. The investigations focus on suspected collusion,
predatory pricing and efforts by airlines to block
competition in certain markets. The industry has denied any
wrongdoing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the newest development, the government has sent
airlines formal requests for information on their
relationship with Airline Tariff Publishing Co., the industry
clearinghouse for fares. It has been learned that major
carriers have begun receiving what are known as civil
investigative demands from the department. The 18-page
request states that the government is investigating possible
price-fixing.
   Trust-busters appear most concerned with industry
concentration at airports dominated by only one or two
airlines. In cities such as St. Louis, Minneapolis and
Pittsburgh, a single carrier now boards more than 70% of
passengers. Studies have shown such dominance results in
higher fares.
   Many of the near-monopolies were created by airline
mergers in the 1980s. But airlines also have developed novel
and complex tactics for defending their turf -- some of which
the government may decide to challenge. Investigators are
examining, among other things, the control of airport gates
and takeoff and landing slots. In Pittsburgh, the Justice
Department is looking at whether an agreement to build a new
airport terminal effectively locks in USAir's 80%-plus share
of that market. USAir denies any wrongdoing, but its
agreement has drawn fire because it prevents other carriers
from moving into the old terminal it will vacate.
   The most controversial practices, however, have to do with
the way carriers publish prices through a commonly owned
computer network. Operated by Airline Tariff Publishing,
based in Washington, D.C., the system was designed to provide
instantaneous transmission of more than 100,000 domestic fare
changes that take place each day in the industry.
Centralizing this information makes it easier for airlines to
enter the data in their computer reservations systems for
travel agents.
   But critics in and out of government believe it also
provides a behind-the-scenes system that enables airlines to
communicate pricing intentions to one another. According to
former and current airline pricing officials, fare changes
and computer coding sometimes contain signals to other
carriers.
   The Wall Street Journal has found evidence of such
"conversations" by arranging to tap directly into ATP's
electronic database. The crucial signals between carriers,
people in the industry say, translate as follows: "Let me
determine the prices at my hub airport and I'll let you do
the same at yours."
   Says Donald Garvett, a former vice president of revenue
management at Pan American World Airways: "It's almost like
electronic negotiation." But, he says, "I wouldn't like to
suggest that anyone is doing anything illegal. It's normal
procedure to defend your turf."
   All of the major carriers except Eastern Airlines refused
requests for interviews on the subject. Several said it was
too sensitive in light of the Justice Department's
investigations.
   David Kunstler, vice president of planning at Eastern, a
subsidiary of Continental Airlines Holding Inc., said in an
interview that he has "no knowledge" that carriers signal
each other through ATP.
   "The word signalling implies an element of collusion, and
we set prices independent of any other airline," he said. "If
anybody at Eastern Airlines were engaging in that kind of
activity, I would absolutely tell them to cease and desist."
   Others, however, say signalling does take place, and it
amounts to a subtle version of the type of price-fixing that
once took place in smoke-filled rooms. "It's a serious
problem," says Ian Ayers, a specialist on antitrust issues at
Northwestern University's law school. The use of the computer
network "is a way of facilitating collusion," he says. "It's
easier to reach agreements. It's easier to detect breaches of
an agreement."
   Before Braniff went into bankruptcy proceedings last year,
pricing officials at the carrier became so concerned about
the communications they were seeing on computer terminals
that they began keeping a log of suspected antitrust
violations. The log has since vanished, former Braniff
employees say.
   The most common -- and perhaps most questionable --
"discussion" between airlines is played out like this:
Carrier A -- often a smaller operator such as Midway Airlines
or America West -- attempts to boost its business by lowering
ticket prices. It enters lower fares in the industry's
computer system. In response, Carrier B -- the dominant
carrier at the affected airport -- not only matches the new
fares, but lowers them in other markets that are served by
Carrier A.
   Carrier B may also attach special codes to its new fares
to get its message across. Pricing executives say some
carriers have been known to prefix new fares with the letters
"FU" to indicate an indelicate imperative. The end result is
that Carrier A often cancels its reduction, depriving
consumers of a lower fare.
   This pattern has occurred many times.
   Last summer, for instance, America West Airlines tried to
attract more business in several markets, including
Minneapolis, with lower fares payable 21 days in advance.
Bargain-hunting vacationers typically respond to such deals.
   America West's reductions might have pressured Northwest
Airlines to cut fares on its busy Minneapolis-Los Angeles
route to $258 a round trip from $308 to match the America
West fare. Instead, Northwest set a new fare that struck
directly at America West's hub in Phoenix. Northwest lowered
its cheapest fare between Phoenix and New York to $168 a
round trip from $208 -- but initially made the low fare
available for only two days.
   That, people in the industry say, was sufficient to
deliver to America West a signal. Five days after instituting
its bargain fares, America West abandoned them. Northwest
says it makes about 20,000 fare changes a day and cannot
reconstruct them a year later, but it says "competitive
initiatives and responses" are a constant part of its
pricing.
   Such exchanges take place in the context of a broad,
continuing dialogue within the computer system -- where
carriers have developed a language for talking to each other.
Former and current airline pricing officials say that when a
carrier wants to communicate its displeasure with a
neighbor's fare cut, it sometimes matches the new fare for a
shorter lifespan. That, they say, is a warning to remove the
new fare from the system.
   Last summer, both Northwest Airlines and Midway Airlines
were offering bargain fares on the Chicago-Grand Rapids,
Mich., route, effective until July 31. Continental and
American had matched the fares, but set their expiration
dates earlier, for July 17. People in the business
interpreted this as a warning to Northwest and Midway to end
their bargain fares earlier, too. Northwest moved up its
expiration date to July 21, and Midway to July 18.
   Another tactic is more subtle. When any fare is changed
even slightly, the electronic tariff program highlights it in
the computer system. Sometimes a carrier will make a weird or
nonsensical change in a fare just so that analysts at another
airline will see the fare highlighted. The message: "Get rid
of this fare."
   Antitrust law makes it illegal for companies to conspire
to fix prices or even attempt to do so. Proving that this has
happened is easier when prosecutors can show evidence of a
face-to-face meeting or telephone call.
   The law is less clear when indirect signaling could be
involved. One test is whether a company's actions appear
economically sound. In 1974, the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York ruled that it was important to determine
whether "a seller's conduct . . . is contrary to its
independent self-interest" in a price-fixing case. Cutting
fares more deeply than necessary to undercut the competition,
for example, would seem intended as a warning to the
competition rather than a genuinely competitive and economic
reduction, especially if fares quickly return to a higher
level.
   Many of the back-and-forth fare tactics in the airline
industry appear to have little economic relevance to the
market involved. To critics, this supports the notion that
airlines are often signalling each other rather than
permitting supply and demand alone to dictate fares.
   Last year, according to a person close to the situation,
United Airlines pricing officials were miffed when Braniff
cut fares on flights between Chicago and Los Angeles, a
lucrative route for United. In response, according to this
person, United introduced a $99 one-way fare between Los
Angeles and Kansas City, which was then Braniff's hub. The
United price cut, from a starting fare of $149, seemed
extreme; United was charging almost three times as much to
fly from Kansas City to Denver. But Braniff, desperate to
stay in business, failed to back down, even after United
again reduced the Los Angeles-Kansas City fare to $94.
"United Airlines declines to comment other than to state its
pricing decisions are based on the competitive marketplace,"
the UAL unit said in a statement yesterday.
   Fares in and out of Kansas City have risen considerably
since the Braniff bankruptcy. Last year, travelers could fly
between Kansas City and St. Louis for $78 round trip.
Yesterday, the lowest fare was $135.
   In coding its new Los Angeles-Kansas City fare on the
computer system last year United inserted as part of the code
the letters "FLYUA." Critics suspect that this and similar
coding shows that carriers sometimes are only interested in
sending each other a message. Last November, Continental
Airlines used the letters "HP" in the combination of letters
and numbers used to code new, lower fares on flights between
Phoenix and Omaha, Wichita, Baltimore and New York City; the
lowest round-trip fare between Phoenix and New York was
reduced to $218 from $228. "HP" is normally the industry code
for America West, which a few days before had invaded
Continental's turf in Houston with new service and low fares.
   After America West withdrew its low introductory fares,
Continental withdrew its "HP" fares. A Continental spokesman
says, "Continental does not engage in or endorse any type of
signaling concerning air fares."
   The Justice Department request that was sent to carriers
recently asks for detailed information on how airlines use
the computer system to "implement fare changes, monitor
fares, {and} make decisions on fares," and on how they might
operate without access to the system.
   It also requests all information about the carrier's
relationship with the ATP system dating back to Jan. 1, 1988.
The government is seeking all documents, training manuals and
newsletters related to ATP, as well as the name and position
of all employees who handle pricing decisions. The Justice
Department is also requesting documents dating back to Jan.
1, 1986, on ATP's role in how carriers monitor, influence and
react to fare changes.
   In an incident last September, it took the nation's
airlines only nine days to match an American Airlines
proposal to raise many fares. That incident, too, is being
investigated by the Justice Department.
   It involved the controversial practice of announcing fare
increases through the computer system in advance, or
"pre-announcing." While this gives consumers advance notice
of fare increases, it may also insure that no carrier stands
alone with higher fares. "It's an abuse of the system," says
John Timmons, minority counsel on the U.S. Senate aviation
subcommittee. "The information age has redefined antitrust.
We don't need Mr. Smith to call Mr. Jones."
   American denies any wrongdoing. "We have followed the
spirit and the letter of the law," a spokeswoman says.
   Last August, United proposed increasing fares by $20 on
many flights in and out of Chicago. The increases were to
take effect in September. American, United's biggest
competitor in Chicago, matched the proposed increases, which
became effective in September.
   Some of the airlines' computer exchanges raise questions
as to whether they are using their fares to discipline
competitors who are out of step. When Northwest slashed fares
out of Chicago last August, a pricing executive at a rival
carrier privately threatened to "trash" Northwest's
Minneapolis hub if Northwest didn't retreat. When Delta
wouldn't go along with a fare increase in January 1989, a
pricing executive at a competing airline privately spoke of
"bombing" Delta's Atlanta hub of operations. A spokesman for
Delta says, "They can do what they want. We don't have any
control over what another carrier does or says."
   By trashing and bombing, airlines executives mean punitive
fare-cutting with "torture" fares. Midway Airlines, people in
the industry say, has been repeatedly "disciplined" by other
carriers for trying to go its own way on fares. Midway, a
post-deregulation startup, is one of the last surviving
low-fare airlines. Pricing, says Sen. John Danforth of
Missouri, "cries out for scrutiny."

   THE JUSTICES UPHELD broadcast-licensing programs favoring
minorities.
   By a 5-4 vote, the high court ruled for the first time
that Congress may authorize affirmative action, not simply to
correct effects of past discrimination, but to promote other
goals, such as racial and ethnic diversity. The ruling upheld
two FCC policies -- adopted by the agency but later ratified
by Congress -- that give minority-owned and women-owned firms
preference in vying for broadcast licenses. Also by a 5-4
vote, the court made it more difficult for citizens' groups
to challenge federal land-use and environmental policies.

   NASA FOUND a focusing flaw in mirrors aboard the Hubble
Space Telescope.
   As a result, the $2.5 billion orbital telescope won't be
able to perform many of its planned scientific experiments.
Space agency officials said they had discovered that one, or
possibly both, of the telescope's mirrors was flawed during
manufacturing. The agency failed to detect the problem during
years of testing on the ground of the telescope, launched in
April by the space shuttle Discovery.
   NASA is hoping that a replacement camera, which is due to
be launched by the shuttle in about three years, will be able
to correct for the mirror's flaws.

   The Senate passed an omnibus housing bill following a day
of rancorous debate that centered more on the regional
inequities of the savings-and-loan bailout than on the merits
of housing legislation. The bill, approved 96-1, is a
compromise between the Bush administration and key senators.
                                                                                                       

   The House approved a foreign-operations bill totaling more

outside of the Middle East by nearly 13% in fiscal 1991 and
also withhold one-half of El Salvador's new military

   Get Contracts

   Carry Estimated Value
   Of Up to $5 Billion Each

   Fluor Corp. and Parsons Corp. said they received contracts
for chunks of Saudi Arabia's massive project to overhaul and
expand its oil and gas production facilities. Analysts valued
each of the contracts at between $2 billion and $5 billion.
   Aramco, the state-owned Saudi Arabian company, is boosting
its energy-producing capacity at a time when world-wide
demand is on the rise. The project, which oil-industry
experts say could cost $40 billion over nine years, has been
divided into three parts, by geographic regions of the
country.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif., said its Fluor Daniel Inc.
unit will act as overall program manager in the northern
region of Saudi Arabia. It will expand and de-mothball
Aramco's production facilities there, including its oil and
gas plants, pipelines and offshore drilling platforms.
   Parsons, a closely held Pasadena, Calif., engineering and
construction concern, confirmed that it had received a
similar contract naming it program manager of the southern
region. A Parsons spokeswoman said she didn't believe that a
central-region manager had yet been named. Aramco officials
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Les McCraw, Fluor vice chairman and chief executive
officer, said, "In a prospective way, it's the most
significant contract we've received in the last decade." He
wouldn't disclose the contract value, however, saying it
would be "premature to speculate on how the program will
unfold. Over the next several months, we will be defining
costs and determining schedules."
   Parsons also declined to put a value on its contract or
discuss other details of the award. The company's spokeswoman
said it was equivalent in nature to the Fluor award, however,
and will include both engineering and construction work.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Fluor's stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $46 a share on
volume of 621,700 shares.
   Fluor said it will start the project next month, working
primarily out of its offices in Houston and in Al Khobar,
Saudi Arabia. It will staff the effort with engineers already
on the payroll, Mr. McCraw said.
   Fluor may be renovating some production facilities it
helped build in Saudi Arabia during the oil boom of the 1970s
and early 1980s, he added. Unlike some other American
engineering and construction companies that left the Middle
East when oil prices fell, "we stayed and did other things,"
he said.
   Analysts expect other U.S. contractors to be involved in
the project, the largest by Aramco in nearly a decade. "The
last time we were looking at a multibillion contract from
Saudi Arabia was probably 1982," said Herbert Hart, an
analyst at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. in San Francisco.
   Companies he and other analysts mention as possibly vying
for some of the new work include San Francisco-based Bechtel
Group Inc.; the M.W. Kellogg Co. unit of Dresser Industries
Inc., Dallas; Foster Wheeler Corp., Clinton, N.J.; and the
Lummus unit of Asea Brown Boveri, a Swiss/Swedish industrial
concern.
   Bechtel declined to comment. None of the other companies
could immediately be reached.
   Mr. McCraw said he wouldn't be surprised to see several
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries "do something similar, maybe not of the same scope
and breadth, but similar. There is a desire for more
production capacity, driven by the perception of energy
growth over the decade of the 1990s."
   Fluor's five-year contract includes options for four years
of additional work on the project. The extent of the program
is still being defined, Mr. McCraw said, but "we will be
involved in planning, analysis and direct execution of the
engineering effort" as well as defining the role of
subcontractors.
   Mr. McCraw said that because Aramco intends to release the
work over several years, the financial impact it will have on
"any single quarter or year for us is still uncertain. We
intend to be conservative in reporting this work in our
backlog." He added, however, that Saudi Arabia will pay Fluor
in dollars, rather than in barrels of oil, as analysts claim
it has paid other U.S. companies in the past.

   Giant Pension Funds' Explosive Growth
   Concentrates Economic Assets and Power
   ----

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The remarkable growth of the nation's biggest
pension funds is concentrating stock ownership and voting
power in fewer and fewer hands.
   While much attention has been given to the rapid growth of
U.S. pension funds, including almost a tripling of their
assets in the 1980s alone, new statistics show the biggest of
the big funds have expanded even more significantly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Between 1985 and 1989, for example, assets of all pension
funds climbed to $2.47 trillion from $1.59 trillion, an
increase of 55%. During the same time, the 20 biggest
corporate and public employee pension funds grew to $621.76
billion from $336.53 billion, an 85% jump, according to
statistics compiled by the Columbia University Law School
Institutional Investor Project.
   The accelerated growth among the giants of the pension
world means that the 20 biggest retirement funds now account
for more than 25% of all pension assets, including stocks,
bonds and other investments, up from slightly more than 21%
in 1985.
   "We see a tremendous concentration of economic power in
the biggest institutional investors," says Carolyn Kay
Brancato, economist for the Columbia project. While
institutional investors number in the thousands, a
disproportionate share of their power "is being crystalized
in a small group" of the biggest funds, she says.
   The growing clout of these pension giants is particularly
evident in the stock market and, especially, their holdings
of America's biggest companies. For example, the 20 biggest
pension funds owned 9.1% of International Business Machines
Corp. and 10.6% of General Motors Corp. at the end of 1989.
   And the rapid growth of the biggest pension funds is
putting more power in the hands of those institutional
investors most likely to try to use it.
   Last year, institutional holders showed their clout by
managing to defeat anti-takeover proxy proposals made by
Honeywell Inc. management. And Texaco Inc. last year agreed
to name a director from candidates submitted by the $54
billion California Public Employees Retirement System.
   The biggest institutional shareholders say their growing
size shouldn't be viewed as a threat to companies'
managements. "There is more concentration, but there is more
sophistication" among the biggest shareholders, says Roland
M. Machold, director of the New Jersey Division of
Investment, which oversees $24.5 billion in state pension
money. "That is an opportunity to work together," he says.
   Still, this growing concentration of stock ownership in a
few hands has the potential to shift the balance of power
between shareholders and corporate managements.
   "The model of {publicly traded} companies as owned by
thousands of anonymous stockholders simply isn't true," says
Bernard Black, a former Securities and Exchange Commission
aide who now is a Columbia law professor. "There are a
limited number of large shareholders, and they know each
other."
   But even the biggest institutional investors don't move in
unison. GM sparked ire from some institutional holders when
it included a measure to increase pension benefits sharply
for Chairman Roger Smith, who is to retire Aug. 1, and other
GM executives. While New York state's public employee pension
system voted against the GM proposal, the California fund
voted to approve it.
   The fastest-growing retirement systems are those for state
and local public employees. These public funds have taken the
lead in challenging corporate managements in proxy votes and
pressing their own suggestions about the way companies should
be run. State systems such as Wisconsin's $20.03 billion fund
are doubling in size every five years, and the California
public employees fund is expected to reach $1 trillion by the
year 2014.
   Public funds account for 13 of the 20 largest pension
funds, according to the most recent tally by Pensions and
Investments, a trade publication.
   In addition to outpacing the asset growth of corporate
funds, public funds are allocating much of their new wealth
to stocks, reducing their traditional reliance on more
conservative bond holdings. As late as 1968, public funds in
California and 15 other states didn't hold any stocks in
their portfolios. In 1970, according to New York Stock
Exchange statistics, stocks equaled less than 17% of the
assets of state and local pension funds. But by 1988, their
stockholdings more than doubled to 37% of their portfolios.
Today, California's two giant state funds hold a total of $38
billion in stocks.
   Corporate pension funds, meanwhile, cut their portfolio
allocations to stocks to 45% in 1988 from 60% in 1970,
according to the Big Board. Corporate plans remain much
bigger stock investors in dollar terms, however, and held
shares equal to 20.8% of the exchange's total capitalization
at the end of 1988, compared with 9.1% for public plans.
   With fewer conflicts of interest than other institutional
investors, public pension funds -- as well as mutual funds,
the second-biggest accumulators of stock in the 1980s --
"will be more likely to advance their own proposals and
oppose management proposals," Mr. Black, the Columbia
professor, says.
   Pension fund officials often argue that their ability to
gang up on companies is greatly exaggerated. Their forces are
divided, because corporate pension funds play almost no role
in anti-management fights, and many, if not most, public
pension funds have neither the stomach nor the resources to
enter proxy frays, fund officials say.
   New York State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, who controls
the state's largest pension fund, says that "even though
there appears to be a lot of power on the institutional side,
there is a lot of countervailing power" for companies'
managements in the form of state anti-takeover laws, the
advantages that the SEC proxy voting system gives managers
and in poison-pill and other corporate defenses.
   Yet another constraint is the maze of SEC regulations that
prevent a pension fund from acquiring more than 5% of a
company's stock without incurring complicated disclosure
requirements. Still other rules effectively ban funds from
discussing proxy matters with more than nine fellow
shareholders unless they want to begin a formal
proxy-solicitation process.
   But pension funds are pushing proposals to get the SEC to
overhaul its rules for proxy contests, and the agency says it
is considering changes.

   L.A. Gear Profit
   Declined by 36%
   In Its 2nd Period

   MARINA DEL REY, Calif. -- L.A. Gear Inc. posted a 36% drop
in net income for the second quarter ended May 31 to $10.2
million, or 51 cents a share, in line with estimates it made
earlier this month.
   The drop from $16.1 million, or 91 cents a share, a year
earlier, represents the first decline in earnings for the
high-flying sneaker maker in three years. Sales, however,
were a record $225.4 million, up 33% from $169.6 million a
year earlier. Year-earlier per-share earnings were restated
for a 2-for-1 stock split in September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   L.A. Gear shares climbed $1.125 to close at $27.25 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, after a
skittish Wall Street sent the stock price tumbling $1.375 a
share Tuesday on anticipation of the earnings release.
   The company blamed the earnings drop on lower gross profit
margins, which were around 35%. L.A. Gear has been selling
more of its lower-priced, less-profitable shoes in an attempt
to gain market share. Earnings were also affected by
increased sales of L.A. Gear apparel and international
footwear sales, both of which have lower profit margins than
domestic footwear sales.
   Company executives told shareholders at the annual meeting
here that profit margins should be better in the next two
quarters, as the company launches new and potentially more
profitable lines. The executives declined to be more specific
about earnings, however, saying the company doesn't make
projections.
   The new footwear will include a highly touted line
promoted by singer Michael Jackson available for the
back-to-school season, and an expanded line of hiker-style
shoes. Robert Greenberg, chairman and chief executive
officer, also told shareholders that the company will
introduce an "inflatable Regulator" sneaker in the third
quarter to compete with Reebok International Ltd.'s
successful Pump basketball shoes, and a bouncy-soled
"catapult" shoe to compete with Nike Inc.'s Air shoes.
   Incoming orders for the second quarter were about $400
million, up more than 50% from a year earlier, L.A. Gear
said. That, coupled with the "expected strong retail demand
for our new higher margin styles . . . should contribute to
renewed earnings increases in subsequent periods," Mr.
Greenberg said.
   The company said earlier this month that with the drop in
second-quarter earnings, net income for the full year should
be "approximately equal to the low end" of analysts'
estimates, which at the time ranged from $4 to $4.50 a share,
compared with $3.01 a share for fiscal 1989.
   In the first six months, net rose 13% to $24.1 million, or
$1.20 a share, from $21.4 million, or $1.23 a share adjusted
for the stock split, while sales jumped 75% to $412.7 million
from $235.7 million.
   L.A. Gear also said it will increase its annual
advertising and promotions budget about 8%. The company had
planned to spend more than $50 million this year, up from
$36.3 million the prior year.

   E-Systems, Inc., Dallas, said it has received a
"multimillion-dollar" contract from a Mobil Corp. unit to
test its computer-based mass storage system over a three-year
period.
   The contract represents the first adaptation of the data
storage system for a nongovernment group, said Philip J.
Rasch, manager of business development for the project.
E-Systems, an electronic systems and products company, hopes
the contract with Mobil will give it a leg up on an estimated
$2 billion market in the 1990s.

   The mass storage system will store the oil company's
exploration data on tape cartridges similar to those used by
video cassette recorders. The recording system was adapted
from one produced by Ampex Corp., Redwood City, Calif., for
broadcast television. The cassettes are stored on shelves and
retrieved by robot for playback on a recorder; the system is
operated by a minisupercomputer produced by Convex Computer
Corp., Richardson, Texas.
   Ampex has the rights to market its portion of the system,
primarily the recording device, for non-automated uses.

   Democrats Respond to Bush Tax Move
   By Offering Possible Spending Cuts

   WASHINGTON -- Democrats, trying to reciprocate for
President Bush's statement that tax increases are needed to
reduce the deficit, began offering possible cuts in popular
government benefit programs at bipartisan budget talks.
   "Tit for tat," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser (D., Tenn.). "They talked about their sensitive point
yesterday -- taxes. We talked about our sensitive point --
entitlements."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), chairman of the House
Budget Committee, listed a host of ways to trim spending on
entitlement programs, including Medicare, federal employee
pensions and agricultural spending. Programs for the poor
weren't mentioned, but participants said there was discussion
-- though no agreement -- about increasing federal income
taxes on Social Security benefits paid to upper-income
Americans.
   The Democratic proposals would trim spending on
entitlements less than President Bush and Republican
congressional negotiators have suggested. Negotiators are
aiming at a $50 billion reduction in next year's projected
deficit. The Republicans want entitlement cuts of $10 billion
or more.
   Despite the continuing differences, budget negotiators
yesterday engaged in what House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D., Mo.) described as a "freewheeling" discussion
of other ways to cut entitlement spending.
   Republicans, even those who have criticized the Democrats
recently, went out of their way to praise them yesterday.
"We're moving in the right direction," said Sen. Phil Gramm
(R., Texas).
   When the budget talks resumed yesterday after a break of
several days there was a markedly different atmosphere, which
both sides attributed to Mr. Bush's statement on Tuesday that
"tax revenue increases" are needed to reduce the deficit.
   "The climate in there is pretty good -- for obvious
reasons," agreed Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.).
   "The whole tenor has changed. It is very determined," said
Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.). "Whatever it was that kept us
from . . . seriously talking seems to have left the scene."
   One sign that the talks have moved into a more serious
phase was a demand from the Senate Finance Committee that it
and the House Ways and Means Committee, rather than summit
negotiators, decide what taxes to increase. But others,
including the administration and congressional negotiators
who don't sit on the tax-writing panels, insisted that the
outlines of a tax increase be shaped at the summit table.
   "We're going to work in tandem," said Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas).

   Mecca Leisure Group PLC, in an about-face from its initial
protest, said yesterday it will accept a #512 million ($890.6
million) bid for the company by the Rank Organisation PLC.
   Rank is a British communications and entertainment group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mecca's board originally argued that the bid undervalued
the British bingo parlor, restaurants and resorts group.
   However, in its statement yesterday, the company said it
recognized it would be unable to reduce its debt
significantly in the near term enough to make its recent
heavy investments pay off.
   "Mecca would benefit from being part of a larger group,"
the company's statement said.
   It also noted that its acceptance of the Rank offer
stemmed in part from the temporary disability of its chairman
and chief executive, Michael Guthrie. Mr. Guthrie, the
architect of Mecca's acquisition-led expansion, is recovering
from recent heart surgery.

   Tokyo stocks rallied on improved volume Wednesday, helped
by technical and fundamental factors, traders said.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 740.98
points at 32312.75. The index gained 447.58 points Tuesday.

   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index fell
104.91 points to 32207.84.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
600 million shares, up from 396 million shares Tuesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 751 to 214,
while 156 issues remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section advanced 39.05 points, or 1.68%, at 2362.40.
   The second section index rose 44.19 points, or 1.07%, to
close at 4155.77. Volume in the section was estimated at 29
million shares, up from 18.3 million shares Tuesday.
   Trading was helped by a shift in sentiment that the U.S.
could lower interest rates, noted Kevin Haag, a trader in
overseas operations at Nomura Securities Co.
   Comments Tuesday by President Bush that he'd accept a tax
hike as part of a deficit reduction plan could cause a change
in the fiscal situation, putting less demand on the credit
markets, Mr. Haag said.
   "As a result, we could see lower yields in the {U.S.},
which means an opportunity for lower yields in Japan, which
is encouraging for equities," Mr. Haag said.
   Some stock market participants said they weren't overly
optimistic that the U.S., followed by Japan, would see lower
rates. "If everyone was so sure that rates were going to
fall, the Dow {Jones Industrial Average} wouldn't be having
so much trouble," one trader noted.
   And while the Nikkei index managed to rise more than 2%,
bond prices and the yen-dollar rate weren't so striking, they
pointed out.
   Also, volume, though improved from its lower levels of the
past few weeks, wasn't strong enough to imply that buyers had
returned in full force, traders noted.
   However, the reappearance of institutional buying
Wednesday was a bullish factor that shouldn't be underplayed,
traders added.
   While lower-rate hopes buoyed market sentiment throughout
the day, the actual rise in stock prices was largely
technically driven, traders said.
   Wednesday was the first day of trading for July
settlement, and investment trust funds began placing fresh
cash on the market, they noted.
   Moreover, arbitragers were seen buying steadily all
through the day, as futures continued to trade at a premium
to the cash indexes.
   Buying was particularly heavy on high-priced, blue-chip
issues. One trader at a leading U.K. securities firm
speculated that talk among the Big Four domestic brokerage
houses that the market had become too unfocused, with too
wide of a range on interest in small shares, resulted in more
directed buying.
   That the Big Four were discussing such strategy "may well
be," Nomura's Mr. Haag said, but Wednesday's rally wasn't
dealer-led. Instead, institutional buyers were reacting to
technical buy-signals, he said.
   NEC was a prime reflection of institutional support, Mr.
Haag said. The stock rose 120 yen to 2,020 yen (78 cents to
$13.06).
   Kyocera continued its recent strength with a 300 yen gain,
to 8,630 yen. Fanuc gained 310 yen to 7,360 yen. Sony,
meanwhile, rose 360 yen to 8,870 yen, and TDK rose 270 yen to
7,320 yen.
   Hitachi rose 50 yen to 1,550 yen, Matsushita Electric
Industrial gained 90 yen to 2,150 yen and Toshiba added 40
yen to 1,110 yen.
   Fuji Photo Film soared 230 yen to 4,620 yen, and Advantest
rose 220 yen to 6,290 yen.
   London shares finished a stagnant session lower, weakened
by technical factors ahead of the expiration of the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Stock-Index future contract.
   Dealers said the broad-based index slipped back when the
premium on the June futures contracted to near parity with
the cash market. There are technical pressures to get the
futures premium down in order to smoothly unwind basket
trades that could dump a large amount of equities into the
market come the Friday contract expiration, some analysts
said.
   "As the premium in the futures collapsed, the cash market
decided to tumble in line with it," said one director of
equities.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index closed
down 26.3 points at 2373.5, a bit better than the 2369.1
intraday low. The market was at its best in the first 10
minutes of trading at 2394.1.
   The Financial Times 30-Share Index was down 24.0 points at
1902.6. Volume registered a modest 389 million shares, down
from the 461.2 million issues traded Tuesday.
   Market watchers said there was concern over the
vulnerability of companies that are largely dependent on
their dollar earnings.
   Dealers suggested that dollar-dependent internationals
were dumped on worries over the new tax plans being fashioned
by the White House. Dealers said the first impression on the
tax news was that it would be unfriendly for the dollar, and
hurt Britain's overseas earners.
   Sterling's strength on anticipated imminent entry into the
Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System also
bruised some members of the sector.
   Imperial Chemical Industries shed 22 pence to #11.62 (38
cents to $20.21), B.A.T lost 11 pence to 652 pence, Reuters
skidded 18 pence to #12.37 and Glaxo Holdings declined 11
pence to 799 pence.
   BICC dropped 16 pence to 442 pence after announcing it was
to raise #177 million from a rights issue to help finance the
purchase of a larger stake in Grupo Espanol General Cable.
   Rothmans International dropped 2 pence to 753 pence after
announcing that its year pretax profit rose 24%.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt,
Zurich, Stockholm and Madrid; lower in Amsterdam, Paris and
Milan; and mixed in Brussels. South African gold stocks
closed marginally higher.
   Also, prices closed higher in Singapore and Seoul, and
lower in Hong Kong, Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Sydney.

   Salant Corp., New York, and its Denton Mills Inc.
subsidiary said they filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Ray Williams, chairman and chief executive of the apparel
company, said continued softness in the retail apparel market
"has made it impossible for us to satisfy our obligations to
our lenders on a timely basis."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Salant said it has arranged with CIT Group/Factoring for
as much as $100 million of secured financing for working
capital, subject to court approval.
   Mr. Williams said the company "strongly believes" it will
be able to operate effectively while negotiating with
creditors. He said "production will not be restricted and
shipments to our customers will not be delayed."
   This is the second time in recent years that Salant has
been in bankruptcy court proceedings. The company earlier
this month defaulted on a $10.8 million payment of bank debt
and warned that it might have to file a Chapter 11 petition.
   Salant has $75 million of subordinated notes outstanding
as well as other debt.

   Times Mirror Co., Los Angeles, said it expects
second-quarter operating results to be the same as in the
first quarter because of depressed newspaper advertising
revenue and higher costs resulting from Los Angeles Times'
circulation gains.
   First-quarter operating profit fell 27% to $94.2 million
from $129.6 million. Net income fell 33% to $46 million, or
36 cents a share, on revenue of $875.2 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror wouldn't comment on its earnings expectations
for 1990. In last year's second quarter, net rose 7.6% to $85
million, or 66 cents a share.
   Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive officer,
said it appears that the advertising softness and higher
costs affecting its newspaper group will "offset the strong
contributions of our professional publishing and cable
television operations" in the latest period.
   Ad revenue from the newspaper group fell 0.7% to $131.4
million from $132.4 million for the four weeks ended June 3.
For the 22 weeks ended June 3 ad revenue fell 1.7% to $713.6
million from $726.2 million. The latest results included 22
Sundays, one fewer than a year earlier.

   Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A. said it agreed to sell a

   GBL declined to specify the exact price but said it was
appreciably above Tuesday's closing price of 9,450 Belgian

travel company. At Tuesday's market price, the stake's value
would total about 10 billion francs ($293 million).

   The sale increases the chances that the French hotel giant
Accor S.A. will gain control of Wagons-Lits' chain of about
160 hotels, analysts said. Accor, in which Generale holds a
12.6% stake, has long expressed an interest in those hotels.
   Generale won't have a free hand at Wagons-Lits. France's
state-owned Caisse des Depots &amp; Consignations is the largest
shareholder in Wagons-Lits, with about 28%. Sodexho, a French
catering company, owns 18.6%, and Rolaco Holding S.A., an
Arab-owned investment firm, has 5.8%.

   Commodities:
   Energy Prices Decline as OPEC Overproduction
   Leaves Tankers of Crude Oil Looking for Buyers

<LP>
   HOUSTON -- The huge overhang of world-wide crude oil
inventories further depressed energy prices, sending them
into a systematic, steep decline.
   "The market gave ground," said Andrew LeBow, a futures
trader with E.D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc. "There
wasn't any one bit of news that sent it down; it was mostly a
slow, steady erosion."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bearish sentiment abounded, and talk in the futures pits
was that storage facilities for oil in the U.S. are full.
Tankers loaded with crude are stacking up offshore trying to
find buyers, market participants say. And some companies are
taking options on giant ships called very large crude
carriers with plans to use them as storage tanks.
   Weakness in commodity markets from London to New York
prompted at least three major oil companies to reduce the
price they pay for the benchmark West Texas Intermediate
crude. Sun Co., the Marathon Oil unit of USX Corp. and
Phillips Petroleum Co. all cut their posted price by 75 cents
a barrel to $15.50.
   In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for
August delivery sank 46 cents to $16.68 a barrel as volume
picked up from recent sessions.
   Traders said the latest American Petroleum Institute
statistics on inventories, released Tuesday afternoon,
confirmed that the long-term oversupply situation hadn't
eased, contributing to yesterday's market weakness. Although
crude stocks declined by 531,000 barrels last week, market
players dismissed the drop as insignificant. They noted that
supplies are about 41.5 million barrels above year-earlier
inventories and consider that a glut difficult to wear down.
   Excess production by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is the biggest contributor to the
oversupply, traders said. "We figure OPEC is producing about
one million barrels a day too much," one trader said. Even if
the group curtails production sharply, "it's going to take a
long time to clean it up," he said.
   Gasoline inventories aren't as high as crude stocks,
traders said, and gasoline contracts have been relatively
strong as a result. Yesterday, however, gasoline for July
delivery ended at 59.49 cents a gallon, down 1.83 cents, on
the New York Merc.
   The API said gasoline inventories declined by 354,000
barrels last week, but market participants were expecting a
larger drawdown ahead of the July Fourth holiday. Even though
the holiday falls in the middle of the week, traders were
still expecting demand to increase more than it has.
   Some traders paint a bearish picture for gasoline prices.
Refinery utilization hasn't yet peaked this summer, they say,
and when more production comes on line, there could soon be
an excess of gasoline.
   "We'll see more gasoline supply on the market, and it
doesn't look like demand is there," Mr. LeBow said. In
addition, the amount of gasoline refined from each barrel of
crude has increased in the summer, putting more product on
the market.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices for pork belly futures
deliverable in August closed 1.95 cents a pound higher at
58.30 cents, just shy of their two-cent daily limit, after a
report detailing the shrinking supply of frozen bellies. Pork
bellies are used in the production of bacon. The report,
released after the close of trading Tuesday, said that
warehouse supplies dropped by about four million pounds last
week after a 4.7 million-pound decline the previous week,
said Charles Levitt, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in Chicago. Warehouse stocks of frozen pork
bellies, at about 73 million pounds, are 29% lower than the
103 million pounds reported a year ago, and they are being
shipped out at a faster rate than last year as well, Mr.
Levitt said. The brisk demand in recent weeks is due in part
to the price of fresh pork bellies exceeding those in cold
storage, he said. Traders also are covering their short sales
-- or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier as a bet
that prices would decline -- to avoid taking a significant
position in the market ahead of tomorrow's release of a
50-state hog and pig report, analysts said. August live hog
futures gained 0.3 cents a pound to close at 58.92 cents.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices rose. The July contract gained 0.28
cent a pound to close at 12.66 cents, only 0.04 cent shy of
the session's high. Judith Ganes, soft commodity analyst at
Merrill Lynch Futures, said the market was strengthened by a
U.S. Department of Agriculture world estimate for sugar
released after the close of trading Tuesday. The report
predicted that supplies will fall short of demand by 2.3
million tons for the crop year ending in August 1991. Many
people in the sugar business had been expecting a slight
oversupply instead. "Even though many in the trade are
skeptical about this projected deficit, it will have a
tendency to make traders not want to be too short," Ms. Ganes
said. She said world sugar supplies still are tight and that
any production problems could worsen the supply picture. "I
am not willing to shut the book on the bull case yet," she
said. Harry Schwartz, tropical analyst at Cargill Investors
Services in New York, said much of the recent sell-off in
sugar came on the belief that the Soviet Union would be
incapable of buying sugar. "That's just not so," he asserted.
"They do have dollars, and they will buy sugar sooner or
later." The Soviets, he said, are shrewd traders and might
even have jawboned the market a bit by stressing their poor
financial condition. "Just think how much further their sugar
dollars will go at 12 cents a pound when compared with buying
at 16 cents," he said.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rallied after falling the previous
two days. July copper settled near its high at $1.10 a pound,
up 1.65 cents. The market was buoyed, according to John
Gross, publisher of the Copper Journal, by the prospect of a
strike against Asarco Inc., a major copper producer. The
current labor contract expires Saturday. Meanwhile, Mr. Gross
said, the level of warehouse supplies is having a confusing
effect on the market because inventories in New York's
Commodity Exchange are rising while London Metal Exchange
stocks are falling. However, he said, the total held by both
exchanges has risen 21% since the end of March to 84,599 tons
from 69,702. Mr. Gross said several factors could be viewed
as supportive of the market in addition to the Asarco
situation. A technical factor is that the July contract has
twice fallen to the $1.07 area and then rebounded. "Some
people would view that as a double bottom," he said, which
some technical traders say could presage a major upward move.
Among fundamental factors, Mr. Gross said, copper prices
might also be supported by the auto industry's plans to
increase production in the third quarter by 10% over the same
period in 1989.

   Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc., Allentown, Pa., said it
acquired a 49% interest in Sapio Industrie, an Italian
producer of industrial gases with annual revenue of about
$100 million.
   Terms weren't disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The acquisition of the Sapio stake follows a string of
other European investments made by Air Products since the
mid-1980s that total more than $500 million. In April, for
example, Air Products increased its stake in Carburos
Metalicos, the largest industrial gas supplier in Spain and
Portugal, to about 30%. The expansion effort in Europe has
effectively doubled the company's asset base there.
   The company said four Air Products executives, including
two European vice presidents and the general manager of the
company's own Milan-based operation, will become members of
Sapio's nine-member board.

   TOKYO -- U.S. and Japanese officials said they settled
most of the issues outstanding in the Structural Impediments
Initiative talks by early Thursday morning and added that
they were pushing to reach a final agreement by Thursday
afternoon.
   After meeting all night, the negotiators broke off after 5
a.m. and agreed to reconvene at 11 a.m. Negotiators said
there was still a chance they wouldn't complete a final
report by Thursday afternoon, in which case they would
probably resume talks in the U.S. next week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The wide-ranging talks, advocating sweeping changes in
macro and microeconomic policies in both nations, are aimed
at altering the underlying causes of the $49 billion
bilateral trade imbalance.
   Attempting to resolve the most contentious issue of the
SII discussions, the Japanese government during the night
said it would spend 430 trillion yen ($2.780 trillion) on
public works over the next 10 years, 15 trillion yen more
than it stated last week. The Japanese government added that
Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. and Japan Railway Group,
which are currently being privatized, will spend about 25
trillion yen over the next decade.
   The U.S. argues that an increase in public spending will
shift resources to Japan's domestic economy and cut its trade
surplus, while Japanese officials have expressed fears that
too much spending will fuel inflation.
   At 10:40 p.m. Wednesday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
spoke with President Bush by telephone and told him he had
made the "maximum effort" in putting together the package.
The two sides are pushing to complete a report before the
Houston summit meeting of the seven leading industrialized
democracies in two weeks.
   The major issue outstanding when the talks recessed
Thursday morning, a member of the U.S. delegation said, was
whether Americans thought the increase would have a
sufficient economic impact. He said U.S. officials were
analyzing the data before the late morning meeting. "We would
have liked to have seen more," he said, but added that "it
does clearly reverse a 10-year trend" of public spending
declining relative to the size of the Japanese economy.
   The two sides, according to the senior Bush administration
official, did reach agreement on the other major policy
issues. Most notably, he said, Japan agreed to "a significant
shortening" of the time required to obtain a patent and gave
"commitments" on increasing penalties for antitrust
violations and strengthening the rights of private parties to
bring antitrust lawsuits.
   Japan also agreed to set up an import advisory council
under the prime minister that will propose projects to boost
imports and will also take measures to provide 24-hour
clearance for imports, the U.S. official said. The U.S. is
also satisfied with actions Japan has taken since an interim
SII report was written in April to streamline its
distribution system, most significantly to insure that large
retail stores can get permission to open less than two years
after applying for a permit. Currently the process can take
more than 10 years.
   The U.S. official said that the two sides were still
haggling over the details of how to follow-up on the SII
final report to make sure both sides adhere to their promises
and that the actions have the desired effect. He said the
U.S. was also pushing Japan to reaffirm clearly that it is
committed to reducing its capital account surplus. In recent
weeks, some Japanese officials have argued that Japan should
preserve its surplus, in part to help aid needy countries.
   While most of the focus has been on Japan, the process is
supposed to be a "two-way street." U.S. negotiators said
President Bush's announcement Wednesday that he would support
an increase in tax revenue proved to the Japanese the U.S. is
serious about reducing their budget deficit, action the
Japanese say is crucial to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign
capital.
   Concerned with mounting trade tensions, and a seemingly
intractable trade imbalance, the two countries agreed to set
up the SII forum last July to supplement an endless series of
sector-specific spats.
   While many analysts have expressed cynicism about the
value of the SII talks, U.S. officials say it could have a
significant effect in reshaping the Japanese economy and
bilateral economic relations within two to three years. If an
agreement is reached amicably, both countries will also
likely hail the pact as further evidence of the decline in
tensions between the two countries.

   BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said
another Mideast war is "inevitable" unless the U.S. blocks
what he sees as aggressive policies by Israel to drive
Palestinians from their land and to dominate the Arab world.
   In his first interview with an American newspaper in
nearly six years, Mr. Hussein, who has a reputation for
brutality, spoke pointedly and unemotionally of his
determination to stand up to any Israeli aggression against
Arab countries, even if it means war. "We shall respond to an
Israeli attack whenever it comes and wherever," he said. "If
Israel attacks one country and there is no response, then the
second country to be attacked surely will be Iraq."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His remarks come at a time when fears of a new Mideast war
are high. Those concerns have been stoked lately by the
formation of a new hardline government in Israel, continued
Palestinian uprisings in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
President Bush's suspension last week of the U.S. dialogue
with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Jordan's King
Hussein, in an interview last weekend, likened the rising
tension to the hair-trigger period before the June 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
   Both King Hussein and President Hussein believe the
Palestinian uprising in Israel and the wave of Soviet Jews
emigrating to the country have convinced Israel's government
that it must find a pretext to push Palestinians out of the
West Bank and into neighboring Jordan. Some of King Hussein's
ministers anxiously describe scenarios that could lead to
war, including an Israeli attack on either Jordan or Libya
followed by an Iraqi military response.
   For some months, the Iraqi president has been threatening
to "scorch half of Israel" with poison gas if it attacks
Iraq. At a distance, those claims sometimes sound like
hotheaded rhetoric. But up close, during a 3 1/2-hour
interview at his heavily guarded presidential palace, Mr.
Hussein spoke with almost clinical detachment of a war in
which Israeli nuclear weapons would be offset by Iraq's
chemical capability.
   As is usually the case with Saddam Hussein, security
during the interview was tight. Briefcases and purses aren't
allowed in his presence, and even ballpoint pens and notepads
are carefully scrutinized. The meeting was held in an ornate
marble room, where a bevy of presidential aides took notes
and two cameras filmed throughout. Mr. Hussein, a reclusive
man who hasn't traveled to the West in more than a decade,
revealed little about his private life. Asked how he relaxes,
the president, dressed in a gray business suit, appeared
genuinely surprised. "He's never been asked that before,"
explained his interpreter, while staff aides whispered that
he should say he goes fishing.
   In discussing the Mideast, Mr. Hussein was careful to
tread the line between toughness and outright aggressiveness.
While he called Israel an "evil entity" and termed the U.S.
"indifferent" to Mideast concerns, he stressed repeatedly
that Iraq will strike only if Israel strikes first.
   While all this war talk may be meant simply to goad the
U.S. into reassessing its Mideast policy, Saddam Hussein's
remarks can't be lightly dismissed. He possesses chemical
weapons -- he has used them before against Iranians and
dissident Iraqis -- and a brash self-confidence largely borne
of surviving his eight-year war with Iran. Furthermore, he
enjoys a freedom to act seemingly unchecked by any force
inside or outside Iraq, an oil-rich nation of 17 million he
has ruled since 1979. Finally, he possesses a million-man,
battle-hardened army and plenty of weapons; for the past five
years, Iraq has led the world in arms imports.
   Mr. Hussein insisted that future wars won't, as in the
past, lead to quick Israeli victories. "If Israel were to
conduct an aggression, then the confrontation must be long,"
he said. And, if the fighting is long, "the outcome will not
be one Israel desires." Asked how a long war is possible
given that Israel has nuclear weapons, he said, "Iraq is in
possession of binary chemical weapons. Our scientists and
military men calculate this is sufficient enough to deter an
Israeli nuclear attack."
   Whether right or wrong, both Saddam Hussein and King
Hussein appear to have convinced each other -- and want to
convince the U.S. -- that Israel is preparing to push the
remaining one million or so Palestinians into Jordan. Both
Arab leaders see Iraq as the best deterrent and the only real
defense should Israel attack. And both leaders insist the
U.S., and to a lesser extent Great Britain, are conducting a
campaign to smear Iraq and thus create international support
for an Israeli attack. "They opened fire," he claimed,
referring to the U.S. and Britain.
   A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said the
ministry couldn't comment on Mr. Hussein's remarks until it
had seen a full text. A spokesman for Israeli Defense
Minister Moshe Arens also declined to respond directly but
said, "Everybody knows that Israel has no aggressive
intentions toward the Arab world and is ready to negotiate
directly for peace. We pray every day we won't have a new war
in the Middle East."
   However far-fetched President Hussein's fears may seem,
the risk is that, either deliberately or inadvertently, Arab
leaders could create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Jordan's
King Hussein, who was the Iraqi president's first and most
loyal supporter during the long Iraq-Iran war, seems to be
huddling even closer to him as Jordan's fears of Israel
mount. For instance, King Hussein refused in an interview to
rule out inviting Iraqi troops into his country. While his
intent would be protection against Israel, Iraq's soldiers in
Jordan almost certainly would be seen by Israel as a
provocation.
   Israel's new government has fanned Arab fears by issuing
policy guidelines which state that the government "will place
immigration and absorption {of immigrants} foremost among its
national objectives." Arabs are further aroused by the
declaration that, "The eternal right of the Jewish people to
Eretz Yisrael is not subject to question, and is intertwined
with its right to security and peace." Eretz Yisrael is
generally seen to include both Israel and the West Bank
occupied by Israel since its victory in the 1967 war.
   "If they've prepared such a scheme, then aggression must
occur," the Iraqi president said. "You cannot avoid war."
   Indeed, there is little talk anywhere in the region of a
peace process, particularly since President Bush suspended
talks with the PLO. The U.S. action was taken after
Palestinian guerrillas launched an unsuccessful raid on the
Israeli coast last month.
   Whatever comes, Saddam Hussein is the Arab leader to
watch. Throughout the interview, he answered questions
patiently, including those about his international reputation
as the "Butcher of Baghdad." His reply: "Weakness doesn't
assure achieving the objectives required by a leader."
   Mr. Hussein's suspicion of the U.S. is always evident. He
called on the Bush administration to withdraw U.S. ships from
the Persian Gulf, arguing they no longer are needed to
protect oil tankers from Iranian aggression. Therefore, he
believes, they must either be spying for Israel or perhaps
planning to provoke a new Iraq-Iran naval confrontation to
tie up Iraqi forces.
   In Washington, a State Department official dismissed Mr.
Hussein's allegations and said U.S. ships are in the Persian
Gulf because of "vital U.S. interests that we have in the
waterways of the Gulf," and not to stir up trouble between
Iran and Iraq. He added that the U.S. has been "very
involved" in working for peace in the region.
   Mr. Hussein also kept open the possibility of using an oil
embargo as a weapon, though today's glutted market would
limit its immediate effectiveness. After Saudi Arabia, Iraq
possesses the world's largest oil reserves. Only the U.S.,
the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia have greater production
capacity.
   "We do not want to use the oil weapon unless forced to do
so in defense of our rights and interests," he said. But,
citing the U.S. and Britain's seizure this spring of large
pipes destined for Iraq and believed intended for
construction of a "big gun" capable of lobbing missiles long
distances, he added, "If the great powers use any opportunity
they see available to suppress others and to reap benefits at
others' expense, then the others will find themselves in a
position that will force them to use any means available."
   As Saddam Hussein sees it, the easing of tensions between
Soviets and Americans has heightened Arab unity, for Arab
nations are no longer divided between two superpower camps.
He said the Cold War's end has also increased America's sense
that it can dictate Mideast policy. "It is now clear the U.S.
can exert influence over the Soviets and make them abandon
any position contrary to the U.S.," he said. "So, America
thinks it can cast things anyway it wants in the region and
in alliance with Israel can suppress any voice in support of
Arab rights."
   But the president's primary point is that the world --
especially the U.S., Britain and Israel -- is misjudging and
underestimating Iraq. Other countries' assessment, he
insisted, is that Iraq's economy, people and leaders are too
exhausted from eight years of fighting Iran to "indulge in a
new war." Furthermore, he said, these nations fear that Iraq,
absent war, will develop into a powerful example of political
and economic independence that other Arabs could emulate.
"The way we see it, they thought this is the time and not any
other when the assault against Iraq must be made."
   He added, "Their assessment is totally wrong. This does
not mean the people of Iraq do not want peace. But people who
fought for eight years know the value of peace." Thus, he
said, it is only "natural such people reject expansionism,
reject hegemony and reject capitulation."
   Both Jordan and Iraq seem genuinely to feel vulnerable
now, though for somewhat different reasons. Jordan, which
held free elections this year, now faces a parliament where
one third of the seats are held by fundamentalists, some of
whom profess to see war as the only way to deal with Israel.
So, Jordan is under internal pressure to stand tough against
Israel. At the same time, officials fear external aggression
from Israel. Trapped between these two pressures, the
Jordanian monarchy appears to fear for its existence. A bad
economy has made discontent even worse.
   For its part, Iraq's president and other officials appear
to have convinced themselves the world is conspiring against
them. British and U.S. diplomats are combing the Gulf nations
warning rulers to fear Iraq, the president claimed. (The
State Department denied the claim.) He declined to say
whether the shipment of 132-foot long pipe seized by British
and American customs agents was indeed intended for creation
of an Iraqi "big gun." If so, he said, the gun wouldn't have
as long a range as missiles already in Israel's possession
and, he argued, Iraq has the right to weapons equal to those
in Israel's arsenal. So, why not disclose plans for the gun
if they exist? "I leave it to your speculation," he said.
   He was similarly coy about any Iraqi nuclear weapons
program. Referring to the French nuclear reactor Israeli jets
destroyed in 198l, he said, "It has neither been our program
nor is it now our program to use these reactors for military
purposes." Asked if he feels chemical weapons are a
sufficient deterrent, he said "yes" but added with a rare
smile, "If the U.S. were to lend us nuclear weapons with the
objective of balancing those Israel was given we shall not
decline them."
   In his one philosophical moment, the president conceded
Arabs made a mistake in 1967 by not accepting Israel's offer
of land for peace. Then, the Arabs believed they could take
back the land without granting peace. Now the Arabs offer
peace for land -- a home for Palestinians on the West Bank --
and Israel seems little interested. Asked about this irony,
he said, "The Arabs have made their mistakes."
   On other issues, President Hussein said Iraq is engaged in
a "direct dialogue" with Iran aimed at transforming the
present cease fire between the two countries into a permanent
peace. He also said he intends to hold a referendum later
this year on both a new constitution and his own leadership.
"If counting votes is the only means for you {the U.S.} to
gauge the popularity of a leader, then you will have figures
this year," he said.
   The president was also characteristically defiant about
Iraq's execution in March of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born
British journalist accused of espionage. The U.S. and Britain
"began to talk about ruthless Saddam with no heart when a spy
is executed to avoid a return to the time when foreigners ran
rampant in this country," he said. "We will not allow any
foreigner to steal intelligence."

   May Unit Illegally Deceived Customers
   In Its Advertising Practices, Court Rules
   ----

   A Colorado state court found that May Department Stores
Co. illegally deceived customers, in a widely watched case
involving the company's advertising practices.
   The ruling affects only the Denver-based May D&amp;F unit of
the St. Louis department-store operator, but it's considered
likely to have a wide impact in the retail industry, where
promotional pricing practices are drawing increasing scrutiny
from state officials around the nation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   May D&amp;F said it is "disappointed" by the decision. "We
believe our advertising practices are fair and appropriate,"
the company said, adding that it is considering an appeal.
   As previously reported, Colorado Attorney General Duane
Woodard claimed that May D&amp;F duped consumers by artificially
inflating its so-called original or regular prices, and then
promoting discounts from those prices as bargains. The state
sought an injunction against the practices, under the state's
Consumer Protection Act.
   May denied the charges, contending in part that its
procedures comply with federal law, which would take
precedence over the state statute.
   But yesterday afternoon, in a 17-page ruling, Judge Larry
J. Naves wrote that May D&amp;F's practices didn't comply with
the Federal Trade Commission Guides Against Deceptive
Pricing. The comparative price advertising policies May
established in 1986 failed that test, said Judge Naves, and
so, to a lesser extent, did the amended policy May adopted in
1989.
   The case, which May opted to fight rather than to settle
out of court as other retailers have done in similar cases,
deals with the pricing of such mundane items as saucepans,
rotisseries, coffee-makers, mattresses and glassware. But it
has provided an intriguing view of how retail price
promotions can make consumers think they're getting a better
deal than they really are.
   In general, May acknowledged that in certain sections of
the store it offered items at what it called the "original"
or "regular" price for 10 days at the start of a six-month
selling season. But few items moved at these levels. The
company then would drop the price, and advertise the items as
below "original price." Further discounts from those
realistic prices were touted as sales prices of limited
duration, as "15-hour specials" and the like. At the end of
the six-month season, the items were briefly marked up again
to the generally noncompetitive levels for another 10-day
period that would re-establish the next 170 days' prices as
"bargains."
   The court found that the state "has proven by a
preponderance of the evidence that May D&amp;F violated all
three" of the deceptive practices alleged in the complaint.
   "May D&amp;F's `original' price for practically all of its
merchandise in the Home Store (section) was a fictitious high
price established as a reference price for the purpose of
subsequently advertising bargain reductions from that price,"
the judge wrote. "The clear expectation of May D&amp;F was to
sell all or practically all merchandise at its `sale' price."
The company's policy as amended in 1989 was a "step in the
right direction," he said, but May's "failure to disclose to
the public its subjective and unique" methodology for price
labeling affected consumers' choices "to their detriment."
   The court enjoined May D&amp;F from establishing a reference
price for the sole purpose of future markdowns unless it
"fully and completely" discloses to consumers its method of
determining those original prices at the same time, in its
ads. It also is prohibited from using price terms "which have
meanings unique to May D&amp;F," unless it also publishes a
glossary of such terms. The order prohibits the unit from
advertising sales of limited duration "in such manner as to
communicate to consumers a false sense of urgency to
purchase," when similar price levels are routinely scheduled
throughout a selling season.
   The court ordered May D&amp;F to pay an $8,000 fine to the
state -- much less than the more than $1 million the state
had sought -- and directed the company to pay costs and
attorney fees to the state; an official at the attorney
general's office estimated that would total $250,000 to
$400,000.
   The attorney general's office called the ruling "not only
a significant decision but a major victory. The court agreed
with our position in all respects." An official said such
practices hurt not only consumers, but also work to the
"disadvantage of small-business competitors who can't compete
with these kinds of advertising shenanigans."

   NEW YORK -- The Treasury's sale of four-year notes was a
big hit with investors yesterday and helped to pull the bond
market out of the summer doldrums.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended nearly 3/8
point higher, a gain of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. Tax-exempt, corporate and asset-backed
securities were lifted by the momentum of the rising Treasury
market and ended with gains of between 1/8 point and 1/4
point.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the auction, the Treasury sold $8.31 billion of
four-year notes at an average yield of 8.50%. Unlike the
Treasury's moderately successful sale of $11.25 billion
two-year notes on Tuesday, yesterday's four-year sale was
considered a blockbuster.
   "It was a very strong auction," said Michael Moore,
manager of government trading at Continental Bank, Chicago.
"There was significantly more demand for the four-year note
than the dealer community anticipated," he said.
   The Treasury said it received $44.78 billion of bids for
the $8.31 billion of bonds it sold, or 5.39 bids for each bid
accepted. That was the highest ever "bid-to-cover" ratio at a
four-year note sale and it far surpassed the previous record
bid-to-cover ratio of 5.07-to-1 set at the October 1985
four-year note sale, according to Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   William Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa
Securities America Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Daiwa
Securities Co., said the bidding was so strong that many
dealers received smaller allotments of the four-year notes
than needed to fill customer orders. He said that dealers who
placed bids at the winning 8.50% yield had expected to
receive at least 50% of the bonds they requested. Instead, he
said they will get just 20%.
   There were rumors that one institutional investor in the
Middle East purchased $2.5 billion of the four-year notes
through a New York-based primary dealer. That may have
accounted for the larger-than-expected demand.
   Just after the auction, "the Street pretty much knew there
was a big buyer," said Michael T. Moran, manager of
government trading at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities
Corp.
   In recent weeks, investors from the Middle East have
re-emerged as major players in the U.S. Treasury market and
have been dumping commodities such as gold and reinvesting
the proceeds into the U.S. and British bond markets. At the
same time, many Japanese investors, who had been big buyers
of Treasury bonds, are pulling back.
   Daiwa's Mr. Brachfeld said that Japanese participation in
the U.S. Treasury market has been light for most of this
year. "The bottom line is that figures show that Japanese
investors have been net sellers," of U.S. Treasury securities
and not net buyers, he said.
   Trading activity in the bond market picked up shortly
after the auction results were announced as dealers scrambled
to buy four-year notes and bonds with other maturities on the
secondary market.
   That buying helped to push down the yield of the new
four-year notes in when-issued activity to 8.45%, well below
their auction average.
   Beyond the rumored buying by the large Middle Eastern
investor, dealers said demand for the new four-year notes was
stimulated by growing optimism that the federal government's
efforts to pare the federal budget deficit will be
successful.
   Although there was no fresh news on the budget talks,
dealers said investors were heartened by President Bush's
statement Tuesday indicating that tax increases are needed to
shrink the deficit.
   "Some optimism that the budget talks will lead to cuts in
the budget deficit contributed to the buying at the auction
as well as the overall positive tone in the bond market,"
said James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc.
   Despite the favorable four-year note auction and increased
hopes that the budget deficit will be reduced, dealers warn
against expecting any steep gains in bond prices in the near
term.
   Caution ahead of the July 6 release of the June employment
report is likely to put a damper on trading activity, they
said.

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 26/32
to yield 8.48% compared with a price of 102 15/32 to yield
8.51% on Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price
of 102 11/32 to yield 8.50% compared with 102 5/32 to yield
8.53%.
   Short-term rates were a little lower. The discount rate on
three-month bills ended at 7.78% for a bond-equivalent yield
of 8.025% while the rate on six-month bills ended at 7.67% to
yield 8.068%.
   In the agency market, the Federal Farm Credit Banks
Funding Corp. priced $3.07 billion of short-term securities.
The bonds were priced at par to yield 8.15% for three-months,
8.20% for six-months and 8.30% for one year.

   Rates are determined by the difference between the

   The bonds of casinos operated by developer Donald Trump
were again the main focus of the junk-bond market.
   The bonds, which have gyrated wildly in recent weeks,
surged again yesterday on news that Mr. Trump was able to
meet some junk-bond interest payments.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc.'s 14% first-mortgage bonds,
due in 1998, finished at 52 5/8, up 1 1/8 points. Trump
Castle Funding Inc.'s 13.75% bond rose 1/2 point to 61 1/2.
   Although Mr. Trump still faces a staggering debt burden,
one junk-bond trader said his debt payment on the Castle
bonds "removes some near-term uncertainty," and helped buoy
other Trump bonds.
   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. continued to climb and
now are trading near par. One junk-bond trader said some RJR
debentures have picked up nearly 20 points since falling to
their lows last November.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds fell sharply as the pound eased
against the West German mark.
   Traders said the value of sterling began to weaken late
Tuesday after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher voiced doubts
about the effectiveness of fixed exchange-rate systems,
although it wasn't clear whether Mrs. Thatcher was referring
to the European Community's current exchange-rate accord.
   In light of the confusion, the value of the pound was
quoted late yesterday at 2.8975 marks, down from 2.9135 late
Tuesday. In bond trading, Britain's 11.75% bellwether bond
due 2003/2007 fell 26/32 to 102 25/32 to yield 11.32%.
   In Canada, the bond market continued to recover from the
drubbing of recent weeks. The benchmark 10.5% 10-year bond
was quoted late at a price of 99.050, up 0.80 percentage
point to yield 10.66%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities prices finished with modest
gains yesterday.
   Helping to support price levels is the relatively light
new supply in the mortgage-backed sector.
   The only mortgage-backed deal announced yesterday was a
$200 million issue of Federal National Mortgage Association
real estate mortgage investment conduit securities.
   The securities, offered by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., are
collateralized with 8.5% Fannie Mae securities.
   Coupon rates ranged from zero percent on a principal-only
class to an initial rate of 9.21250% on a floating-rate class
that is priced over the one-month London Interbank Offered
Rate and reset monthly.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for July delivery were up 7/32 at 99 to yield 9.78%.
   Among other actively traded mortgage securities in the
secondary market, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
securities for July delivery were up 7/32 at 98 11/32 and
Fannie Mae 9.5% securities for July delivery were also up
7/32, at 98 27/32.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Among new issues, the state of Maryland issued $95 million
of general-obligation bonds priced to yield from 6.10% for
three-year notes to 6.90% for 15-year bonds.
   Retail investors, rather than institutions, were the big
buyers of the GOs, according to lead underwriter Marine
Midland Capital Markets. The strong retail interest may be
tied to high credit quality; Maryland is one of only eight
states that carries a triple-A credit rating.

   Equimark Sees Deficit
   Wider Than Expected
   For Second Quarter

   PITTSBURGH -- Equimark Corp., which has seen the top three
executives at its main banking unit depart in recent months,
said it sees higher-than-expected losses in the second
quarter.
   The expected net loss of between $12 million and $17
million reflects an ill-fated acquisition attempt in Texas,
bad commercial and real estate loans and litigation-related
expenses, Equimark said. Equimark expects that loss despite
an anticipated one-time $14.2 million gain from the sale of
its credit-card business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1989's second quarter, Equimark earned $4 million, or
33 cents a share.
   The forecast of wider losses comes amid speculation that
Equimark wants to clear its balance-sheet problems now to
attract buyers. But Equimark Chairman Alan S. Fellheimer said
there are no plans to sell the bank.
   Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said that
he had expected a loss of $6 million to $7 million and that
Equimark's consumer credit problems were worse than
anticipated.
   Mr. Fellheimer said Equimark released its earnings
forecast at the request of the New York Stock Exchange. In
composite trading Monday, the stock plunged 15.3%, closing at
$6.25. Yesterday, the share price closed at $6.50, down 12.5
cents.
   In the first quarter, Equimark had a loss of $15.4
million, compared with a profit of $5.7 million, or 50 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   In addition to a high provision for possible loan losses,
Equimark said it had losses in its unsuccessful effort to
acquire National Bancshares Corp. of San Antonio, Texas.
   Equimark also incurred costs related to litigation, but
Mr. Fellheimer declined to indicate what the litigation
entailed.

   French auto maker Peugeot S.A. said it expects
consolidated revenue for 1990 to exceed the 7.9% gain it
reported for the first quarter, when sales totaled 44.14
billion francs ($7.90 billion).
   Jacques Calvet, chairman of the French auto group, didn't
specify the scope of the expected improvement, but he said it
would reflect catching up on production lost to a flood in
one of the group's main plants in February, as well as the
success of new models launched in the luxury end of the car
market during 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Calvet didn't forecast full-year earnings or cash
flow, although he said he wouldn't be disappointed if
consolidated 1990 cash flow came in close to the 1989 level
of 18.553 billion francs.
   Calvet also said the net treasury position of the group
showed a surplus of between 1.5 billion and 2 billion francs.
As reported, Peugeot was a net debtor until the end of 1989.
   For all of 1989, Peugeot's consolidated net profit after
payments to minority interests was 10.30 billion francs on
revenue of 152.96 billion francs.

   Senate Passes Omnibus Housing Bill
   After Debate Centered on S&amp;L Bailout

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed an omnibus housing bill
after a day of rancorous debate that centered more on the
regional inequities of the savings-and-loan bailout than on
the merits of housing legislation.
   The bill, approved 96-1 last night, is a compromise
reached Tuesday by the Bush administration and key senators.
But the floor debate quickly deviated to the S&amp;L bailout as
several senators representing the Northeast and north-central
states charged that the bailout represented a transfer of
wealth from their states to the Southwest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "When was the last time New York had this kind of
assistance?" asked Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.) as he
brandished a copy of the federal water projects legislation
that he maintained was heavily weighted to Texas and other
Southern and Southwestern states. He answered: "When we built
the Erie Canal."
   Yesterday's action continued the debate over who pays for,
and who benefits from, the $100 billion the U.S. expects to
spend on the thrift-industry cleanup, not including interest.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) offered an amendment that
would target community-development funds to housing
jurisdictions based on a formula that takes into account the
amounts individual states will receive in the S&amp;L bailout.
The D'Amato amendment was offered in response to an amendment
by Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) that would allocate funds
based on population, similar to general revenue-sharing
programs that were largely scuttled during the Reagan
administration.
   "To tie this to the savings-and-loan bailout is, pure and
simple, outrageous," Sen. Gramm said. "I have been offended
by the whole level of logic in this debate."
   Sens. D'Amato and Gramm ultimately agreed to turn the
matter of the formula for community-development grants over
to Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, who is to study the current
formula and report his recommendations to the Senate by July
1, 1991.
   At a news conference before the debate, Mr. Kemp called
the bill "the most significant step toward committing this
country on a bipartisan basis to combating the conditions of
homelessness, hopelessness, despair, and poverty that has
taken place in this town since the original War on Poverty."
   The compromise bill calls for outlays of $18.1 billion in
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1., $19.5 billion in fiscal
1992 and $21 billion in fiscal 1993. It includes agreement on
four major provisions that had kept the two sides haggling
for the past three weeks. The administration won on two of
the four major points, including what it hopes will be full
funding for a home-ownership initiative that would provide
funds for public housing tenants to purchase rather than rent
their homes or apartments. The administration also won
changes in the Federal Housing Administration
mortgage-insurance program to provide a stronger capital base
for the fund.
   Additionally, agreements were reached on the eligibility
requirements for housing assistance, targeting more of the
funds to the very poor, and allowing housing jurisdictions to
fund new construction after they demonstrate special need for
new housing.
   Secretary Kemp acknowledged that the funding levels in the
bill are subject to change. "It is obvious," he said, "that
the budget summit will have an impact, not only on the final
authorization, but the final appropriation of housing funds."
   The House Banking Committee has approved a housing bill
that would be considerably more expensive than the Senate
version.

   FASB to Postpone the Effective Date
   For Its Ruling on Retirement Benefits
   ----

   NORWALK, Conn. -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board
agreed to delay for a year the effective date of its pending
rule requiring companies to account for costs for retirement
benefits other than pensions.
   The FASB, the rule-making body for the accounting
profession, had indicated it would make the rule effective in
1992. The latest decision would require companies to adopt
the proposed rule in 1993, although some companies already
have begun to recognize the costs. (Technically, the rule
would cover companies with fiscal years that begin on or
after Dec. 15, 1992.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposal is of great concern to many companies because
it will require companies for the first time to reflect on
their books the present and future costs of benefits -- such
as medical and insurance coverage -- that employees will
receive after they retire. The total is huge, perhaps $400
billion by some estimates. And the prospect of incurring such
costs has prompted some companies to decline to provide
medical and insurance benefits for retirees.
   The FASB has been circulating the "exposure draft" of the
proposal for comment, and hopes to issue a final rule before
yearend. The proposal has been in preparation for a decade.
   FASB Chairman Dennis Beresford said the one-year extension
reflected concern in comments from more than 400 companies
and groups. "We received information that it would be hard to
accumulate information, and to train actuaries. It would be
fair to give companies one more year to do it in an orderly
fashion."
   The group tentatively agreed to allow companies the option
of taking a one-time charge to income for benefits the
companies already are committed to pay. Companies that don't
choose that option could account for the accumulated costs
over a 20-year period, instead of the previously proposed 15
years. However, that language is subject to further review,
Mr. Beresford said.
   The previous draft didn't permit the option of recognizing
the costs all at one time. About 90% of the comments on that
issue favored permitting one-time recognition, perhaps
indicating that many companies will take that option.
   After recognizing previously accrued costs, companies
would take as an annual expense the estimated cost of
benefits to be earned in subsequent years.
   Most companies previously haven't reflected in their books
non-pension retirement benefit costs. Amounts paid to
retirees in the current year are deductible, but amounts for
future years for both retirees and employees are subject to
more stringent rules for a tax deduction.
   Nonetheless, some companies already have decided to take
the charge expected to be required to get it behind them.
Dallas-based LTV Corp. in late 1988 recorded a $2.26 billion
charge to cover its entire unfunded liability for such
benefits for current and retired employees.
   Despite the proposed changes, the FASB proposal still
presents major difficulties for many companies. "I wonder if
FASB isn't running a little scared," said Bill Miner, an
actuary in Chicago for employee benefits consultant Wyatt Co.
"The rules are very onerous, particularly to rustbelt type
companies, those that have a large number of retirees."
   Moreover, he said, many companies oppose the rule because
it will require assumptions that are difficult to make.
"Figuring out the rate of future medical cost increases is
one issue that looms out there," he said.

   Hovnanian Expects
   Earnings to Decline
   For This Fiscal Year

   RED BANK, N.J. -- Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., a developer
of moderately priced suburban homes, said it expects sharply
lower earnings for its year ending Feb. 28, 1991, as the
sluggish regional economy continues to hurt sales.
   The company said it expects earnings of $5 million to $7
million, or 25 cents to 35 cents a share, on revenue of $290
million to $325 million. In fiscal 1990, net was $21.8
million, or $1.05 a share, on revenue of $410 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The fiscal 1990 earnings were 24% below fiscal 1989's.
While projecting a second year of decline, the company
stressed its belief "that fundamental demand for
competitively priced homes in the best locations remains
strong." In the past, the company has had up to 75% of its
volume in townhouses and single-family homes priced between
$70,000 and $130,000, which sold quickly, but such homes have
become harder to develop and harder to sell.
   "In the past years we had that success. People were
camping out, waiting on long lines -- we had to hold
lotteries," said John J. Schimpf, executive vice president.
But with layoffs and employment uncertainties in the New York
metropolitan area and a great supply of unsold houses in its
important central New Jersey market, buyers have become very
picky.
   "There's been healthy skepticism about housing prices in
the metropolitan area. A lot of the pent-up demand for
housing has been run out of the marketplace," Mr. Schimpf
said. Instead of cutting prices, however, Hovnanian is
offering buyers appliance packages and paying closing costs
to aid sales. Such incentive costs, along with declining
sales volumes, are depressing earnings, Mr. Schimpf said.

   Bill on Pesticide Residues

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee approved a bill designed to standardize regulation
of pesticide residues in raw and processed food.
   The measure, approved by voice vote, would establish a
tolerance level under which pesticide residues would be
allowed as long as they wouldn't expose a person to a greater
lifetime cancer risk than one in a million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This would eliminate the so-called Delaney paradox. Under
the Delaney clause, which applies to processed food, a
chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals.
Under other laws applying to pesticide use, however, that
same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it
fell within the Environmental Protection Agency's tolerance
level.
   Although the bill was approved, lawmakers are continuing
to discuss modifications with the Bush administration and
hope to work out a compromise before the measure reaches the
floor. Among possible changes are whether to allow health or
economic factors to be taken into account when deciding
whether to allow pesticide use and whether to let federal
rules override state standards.
   In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee hasn't yet
taken up a similar bill.

   So now we can get serious about the most intriguing issue
to face the state in some years: Should the Santee Sioux
Indians build a high-stakes casino in Council Bluffs? Should
the Mesquakies buy the money-losing Prairie Meadows race
track in Des Moines?
   Those are real issues with no easy answers.
   Iowa, believe it or not, allows more forms of legal
gambling than any other state, according to I. Nelson Rose, a
California law professor who studies such things. Iowa has a
lottery, and legal betting on horses and dogs, and casinos on
riverboats, and bingo, and there's even talk of allowing some
legal betting on sports.
   So talk of big-time gambling run by Indian tribes -- an
idea that seems to be somewhere between dangerous and dumb --
is not to be taken lightly.
   Indians have a special status under the gambling laws of
this country. They can set up their own rules for any kind of
gambling as long as that type of gambling is not prohibited
within the state. In other words, if a state allows bingo but
has a $5 limit, Indians can set up bingo parlors with no
limit. If a state allows blackjack but caps bets at $2,
Indians can set up blackjack games where you could win -- or
lose -- tens of thousands. The Indian games simply have to be
on Indian-owned lands. What's more, Indians can advertise
their games; others, for the most part, are barred from
advertising gambling.
   "A principal goal of federal Indian policy is to promote
tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency, and
strong tribal government," a 1988 law states, and then it
goes on to reaffirm to the Indians their gambling franchise
as part of that policy.
   And Indians have taken advantage of this. By one count,
more than 100 of the nation's 170 or so Indian reservations
run legal gambling operations catering to non-Indians. Last
year, some $400 million was wagered on these lands, up 15%
from a year before, according to Gaming &amp; Wagering Business
magazine.
   "The new federal statute has created unbelievable
opportunities for Indian tribes. . . . I find there is more
interest in Indian gambling than in any other possible game,"
Mr. Rose, the California professor, says.
   States have long wanted to control the operations, but
they've generally been stopped by the courts. Indian tribes
can even buy land off their reservations to set up gambling
operations, but that requires the approval of some community,
state and federal officials.
   That's why the plans of the tribes in Iowa have become an
issue.
   The Santee Sioux tribe wants to join forces with a Nevada
casino company and build a $67 million casino and hotel in
Council Bluffs, which until now has been famous mostly as the
town where Abraham Lincoln once visited and sort of decided
to run for president, and as the burial place of Amelia Jenks
Bloomer, the 19th-century suffragette who lent her name to a
kind of women's underwear.
   Council Bluffs is just across the Missouri River from
Omaha, and Des Moines and Kansas City are just a couple
hours' drive, so the casino, which would be the biggest
gambling house between Atlantic City and Las Vegas, might do
a pretty brisk business. It clearly would change the nature
of the area and probably of the state. And it clearly would
make money for the tribe.
   "I don't see Ford Motor Co. coming out here to build a
plant," Donald LaPointe, the tribal chairman, told the Des
Moines Register the other day. "What . . . are we supposed to
do" to find prosperity? The tribe's reservation is in an
isolated area of northeastern Nebraska, 150 miles from
Council Bluffs, and most of the 500 or so Indians still on
the land live in poverty.
   But that doesn't sway Terry Branstad, Iowa's Republican
governor, who is running for re-election this year. He thinks
the Council Bluffs plan is bad, and so, too, he thought, was
the Mesquakie tribe's plan, since abandoned, to buy the
beleaguered Des Moines race track -- whose publicly backed
financing, arranged through a backdoor of politics, cost
three local Democrats their jobs in the primary election this
month. Under the law, he apparently can block either project,
since neither is on land currently owned by tribes.
   "I've been very clear, very emphatic about my opposition
to expanding gambling in Iowa beyond what has already been
authorized by law," the governor told reporters a couple
weeks ago. "I'm committed to seeing that we adequately
safeguard, protect and control the integrity of this state
and not go any further into gambling."
   That's noble, and probably right. But it would be more
noble if Mr. Branstad weren't the same man who has ruled the
state as it has embraced virtually every type of gambling
there is. It would be more right if Iowans -- indeed, if all
Americans -- really cared about the Indian population, really
worked to ensure prosperity for the tribes, and were as
imaginative in seeking economic gain for the Indians as in
seeking revenue from gamblers.
   For the Indians shouldn't be building casinos and buying
race tracks that can live outside the rules governing others
in the gambling business. Indians should be encouraged in
their entrepreneurship, but advantages given them shouldn't
be the advantage of spreading vice and changing the character
of a state or community.
   It's hard to find a group of people who have been cheated
more in America than have been the American Indians. But
having them build a casino in Council Bluffs doesn't seem
like a very smart way to start righting the wrongs of the
past.
   It's almost as dumb as putting floating casinos on the
Mississippi River. But nobody in Iowa would want to do
anything like that.
   Or almost nobody.

   Rothmans International PLC, a British tobacco concern,
reported a 24% rise in its pretax profit in the year to March
31, 1990, helped by an increase in sales and income from its
cash balance.
   The pretax profit of #405 million ($704.5), up from #326
million the year earlier, was above market expectations of a
figure of #395 million.
</LP>

   Profit after taxes and minority interests rose 23% to #203
million from #165 million the previous year. Earnings per
share jumped 23% to 64 pence from 52 pence.
   Net profit attributable to shareholders also totaled #203
million, because there were no extraordinary items in the
year. The figure was up 16% from #175 million a year earlier,
when the company reported an extraordinary gain of #10.1
million.
   The company plans to pay a final dividend of 9.2 pence a
share, giving a full-year payout of 15.4 pence, up 25% from
12.3 pence paid in 1989.
   Operating profit, or profit before tax and interest
income, rose to #363 million, up 23% from #295 million. Total
sales rose 16% to #2.22 billion from #1.91 billion.

   S.G. Warburg Analyst Goes Against the Street
   By Recommending Sale of Time Warner Stock

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Lisbeth R. Barron, an analyst at S.G. Warburg,
has done the unthinkable. She has pulled her neutral
recommendation on Time Warner and advised clients to sell
their shares.
   Virtually every other Wall Street analyst is bullish,
touting Time Warner as tomorrow's global media giant. But Ms.
Barron's opinion has more than scarcity value. Her scrutiny
of Time Warner's numbers -- no less than her conclusion --
departs from the crowd, and they suggest that the Street is
off the mark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's very easy to get caught up in this excitement" over
Time Warner's potential in foreign markets, she says. "But
when you get down to core markets, the numbers don't shine
through."
   Valuing Time Warner has been problematic since last year's
merger of Time and Warner Communications -- not least because
the company won't have earnings for the foreseeable future.
   The company, having turned down a $200-a-share offer from
Paramount, is unusually eager to boost its stock price. And
it has given an encouraging nod to analysts who value the
firm at about $250 a share.
   Analysts, in general, have reached such values by
estimating what various pieces would fetch in sales to
private buyers. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for instance,
calculates a "private-market value" of $225 a share and then
concludes that Time Warner's stock should someday sell at 75%
of that figure, or $168.75.
   "We're not in a world where this company will get taken
over," DLJ's Mark Manson concedes. "So why value them at what
a private buyer would pay? You have to value it somehow. And,
historically, that's how they've traded."
   Ms. Barron's numbers suggest another route. She is bullish
on Time Warner's individual units, though not as bullish as
the consensus. Noting the advertising slump, she is cautious
on Time Warner's publications. She says it will be hard to
significantly boost film profits compared with 1989, when the
company launched the blockbuster Batman. And Home Box Office
earnings she sees as flat.
   With all that, Ms. Barron forecasts 1990 operating cash
flow, or the cash provided by operating units, at $2.3
billion, within 10% of what other analysts predict. And she
forecasts that the figure will climb at a healthy 10% to 15%
per year.
   That hardly sounds bearish. But Ms. Barron focuses on free
cash flow, the amount of operating cash left after paying
interest on Time Warner's $10.5 billion in debt, dividends on
common and preferred stock, overhead and capital spending.
And, she notes, "interest expense and dividends on its
preferred stock will cut dramatically into free cash flow."
   This year, Ms. Barron estimates free cash flow of perhaps
$4.27 a share. By 1993, assuming the company's pay-in-kind
preferred converts to cash, free cash flow should double to
perhaps $9 a share, Ms. Barron says.
   But if Ms. Barron's estimates are correct, Time Warner is
trading today at a pricey 11 times the free cash flow
anticipated in 1993. In other words, were the stock to stand
still, it would still be expensive, relative to cash flow,
three years later.
   For companies such as Time Warner, free cash flow measures
how much cash will be left to retire debt. And in the absence
of earnings, free cash flow is the best available proxy.
   Permeating the Street's thinking is a grand vision of the
Time Warner of the future benefiting from synergies and
economies of scale in its many markets.
   In the future, according to Time Warner's many fans, the
average Joe will be surrounded by a galaxy of the company's
audio and visual products, and it will matter not whether
this Joe lives in Albany, N.Y., or Alsace-Lorraine, France.
As barriers fall in Europe, Time Warner will be there.
   A Kidder Peabody report says, "the new entity is
structurally positioned to compete in an increasingly global
market." Kidder's Christopher Dixon cites Time Warner's joint
venture in Scandinavian pay television as evidence. "It has
the critical mass and size to gain market share," he says.
   Ms. Barron isn't convinced. Time Warner missed out on
buying music powerhouse Geffen Records, which was acquired by
MCA for nearly $500 million in stock. "Time Warner's
investment bankers just told the world that their stock is
worth $250 a share, so how can they use stock {at its current
level} to acquire anything?" she asks. And highly leveraged
Time Warner is unlikely to purchase much by issuing more
debt.
   Jerry Levin, Time Warner's vice chairman, won't discuss
the company's precise valuation. But in his view, valuing the
company at a strict multiple of free cash flow is simplistic.
Ticking off such features as Time's control over
distribution, its geographic spread, its technological
prowess, and the franchise nature of assets such as Time
magazine, Mr. Levin says, "These aren't fungible products. I
attach a premium to them." As for the company's flexibility,
he says, "everything that's strategically necessary, we're
going to do."

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Buddy is running again.
   In the middle of his popular afternoon radio talk show,
former mayor Vincent A. (Buddy) Cianci Jr. announced that he
will run for mayor as an independent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Cianci was the subject of a front-page article in The
Wall Street Journal last week. He served three terms as mayor
of Providence (two as a Republican and one as an independent)
from 1975 to 1984 before being forced to resign after
pleading no contest to two assault charges for beating up the
lover of his estranged wife.
   Mr. Cianci, in an emotional speech on his show, told
listeners, "Experience is a great teacher, but often a
painful one."
   Because of his candidacy, Mr. Cianci is leaving his jobs
as a radio talk-show host and a TV political commentator.
Indeed, he went off the air yesterday after making his
announcement about 4 p.m., two hours before the radio program
was scheduled to end.
   He decided to run even though one poll conducted recently
showed that 44% of the city's voters would be embarrassed by
his election. Mr. Cianci is still believed to be a strong
candidate, however, because he has a core of staunch
supporters and the incumbent isn't running for re-election.

   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration announced
that Interpharm Inc., Plainview, N.Y., agreed to withdraw a
generic drug for hypertension because of questions over the
drug's approval process.
   The FDA emphasized that it had no evidence of safety
problems with the drug, clonidine hydrochloride, which is
also made by several other generic-drug manufacturers. But
the agency questioned whether the drug Interpharm placed on
the market is therapeutically equivalent to the brand-name
product on which it is based.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The recall was the result of findings by the FDA's St.
Louis laboratory that samples of the Interpharm product
submitted for FDA approval weren't the same as the drug that
was subsequently marketed. The FDA said Interpharm will now
audit all its 24 product approvals.
   Reps. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Thomas Bliley Jr. (R.,
Va.) issued a joint statement on this and other recent FDA
recalls, saying they "will undoubtedly add to the list of
seven or more companies being investigated by the U.S.
attorney in Baltimore for fraud and false statements."
Congressional hearings are scheduled this morning on a bill
by the two legislators to stiffen penalties for fraud
committed by generic-drug companies.
   A spokesman for the company, a unit of Interpharm
Laboratories Ltd. of Israel, couldn't be reached for comment.

   LOS ANGELES -- The state of California sued Charles H.
Keating Jr., several officers and directors of American
Continental Corp. and the company's former accountant for
alleged fraud in the sale of $250 million in now-worthless
bonds.
   The complaint, filed in Orange County Superior Court,
seeks restitution for bondholders and civil penalties that
could range from $50 million to $100 million. The suit is the
latest in a barrage of litigation seeking "deep pockets" to
repay investors and others in the collapse of Lincoln Savings
&amp; Loan Association, a subsidiary of American Continental.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The defendants include Jack Atchison, a partner in the
accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co. who later went on to
work for American Continental. Arthur Young, which now does
business as Ernst &amp; Young, also is named in the complaint. An
Ernst &amp; Young spokesman said the company hadn't seen the suit
and couldn't comment.
   The subordinated debentures were sold through Lincoln's
branches, and the suit alleges that the company specifically
targeted elderly investors for the bond sales. The government
alleges that the thrift's collapse may cost taxpayers more
than $2 billion.
   James Feder, an American Continental lawyer, called the
suit "a waste of time and money" and said the allegations of
a policy to sell the bonds to the elderly were not true.
Lawyers for Mr. Atchison weren't immediately available to
comment.

   WASHINGTON -- In a reversal of his position, House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski plans to
introduce a bill creating tax-free enterprise zones in
impoverished areas.
   The Chicago Democrat plans to hold a press conference on
the subject today, a senior aide to the chairman said. His
change of heart greatly increases the chances that some sort
of enterprise-zone bill will be part of any tax legislation
enacted this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, particularly Housing Secretary
Jack Kemp, has been pushing a proposal to establish as many
as 50 enterprise zones in distressed urban and rural
communities. Investments made in the zones would be given
tax-favored treatment, costing the government an estimated
$300 million annually by fiscal 1993. But the
administration's proposal has been rebuffed in the past,
partly because of a lack of support from Mr. Rostenkowski.
   Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal would allow for fewer zones
than the administration proposal, but tax staffers said it is
designed to cost the same amount.
   The aide to Mr. Rostenkowski said it was a coincidence
that the Ways and Means chairman's change of heart came in
the same week that President Bush reversed his position on
tax increases. "The chairman has been looking at this for
quite a while," the aide said.

"This injunctive remedy would mean the SEC would no longer be
required to go to court to secure a temporary restraining
order or permanent injunction," said Rep. Matthew Rinaldo
(R., N.J.).
   The bill also would permit the SEC to ask courts to
prohibit people convicted of a securities-law violation from
serving on the board of a public company. Moreover, the bill
would let the SEC impose on violators fines of up to $100,000
for individuals and $500,000 for firms, or the amount of
their profits, whichever is greater. The bill is identical in
most respects to a measure passed by the Senate Banking
Committee.
   The committee also passed by voice vote legislation aimed
at curbing fraud and abuse in the penny-stock market. The
bill would, among other things, substantially increase
disclosure requirements for some penny-stock issues and
expand SEC power to bar crooked penny-stock salespeople from
the securities industry.

   WAYNE, N.J. -- Union Camp Corp. said it will form an
employee stock ownership plan with $160 million in new
convertible preferred stock.
   The manufacturer of paper, packaging and wood-based
chemicals, said the plan will cover salaried employees and be
part of their existing savings and investment plan. After the
issuance of the preferred stock, Union Camp plans to buy back
as many as 4.5 million shares of its common stock in periodic
open-market transactions. Union Camp has 68.9 million common
shares outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ESOP and terms of the convertible preferred stock will
be completed within a month, the company said.
   Some companies have issued convertible preferred stock to
ESOPs in order to put stakes in friendly hands, a maneuver
that helps thwart takeover attempts. But analysts said Union
Camp's explanation for the move -- simply to "further align
the interests of employees with those of our shareholders" --
was the more likely motive.
   With the overall decline in takeover activity, the use of
ESOPs as anti-takeover devices "is pretty much dead," says
Lawrence Ross, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   Separately, Union Camp said it has developed a new
paper-bleaching process that greatly reduces the amount of
chlorinated organic waste, including dioxin and chloroform.
   The company said it plans to install the new technology as
part of a $158 million modernization of its Franklin, Va.,
pulp and fine-paper plant. The process, for which Union Camp
said it is seeking a patent, will help it comply with new
Virginia water-quality standards, the company said.
Installation is expected to be completed in the second half
of 1992.

   BOSTON -- The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston called a proposal before the Massachusetts Legislature
for a 5% sales tax on services "a potential economic
disaster."
   Richard Syron, in an unusually strong comment by a Federal
Reserve president, said the tax would hurt the state's
competitive position in services and could drive business
away from Massachusetts -- and even result in lost tax
revenue.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The state Senate recently approved a proposed sales tax on
fees charged by mutual funds and other financial services,
accountants, lawyers and public relations firms, among
others, to help eliminate a budget deficit now estimated at
about $1 billion for the fiscal year ending Saturday; the
Senate bill also includes a small increase in the state
income tax. The state House, however, has passed a bill that
relies mostly on a larger increase in the state income tax.
   The two legislative bodies haven't been able to resolve
their differences. Business groups are lobbying strongly
against expanding the sales tax, which would be among the
broadest on services in the nation, while labor groups are
lobbying for it and against increasing the income tax.
   The state's budget deficit, and the legislature's deadlock
on a solution, have resulted in Massachusetts' having the
lowest-rated general obligation bonds in the nation, with a
Baa rating from Moody's Investors Service Inc.

   Menard Enterprises,

   Menard Enterprises Inc., Rhode Island's second-largest
auto dealership has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code, underscoring the tough times for
new car dealers caught in a sales slump.
   In reaction to the slump, some auto makers, concerned
about the potential loss of sales outlets, are stepping up
efforts to keep struggling dealers in business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Menard, which has dealerships in three Rhode Island
cities, is the latest in a string of big car dealer chains to
petition a federal bankruptcy court for protection from
creditors and for time to develop a debt-repayment plan.
Menard's seven auto franchises listed an unspecified amount
of assets and liabilities.
   "It's a tough business right now," said Aldo Sammartino,
president of a Rhode Island dealer group. Last year, about
25% of new car dealers lost money and about 300 of the 24,900
dealers in the U.S. went out of business, he said. The
National Automobile Dealers Association expects just as many
failures this year.
   General Motors Corp., meanwhile, says 35%-40% of its
dealers currently aren't profitable. Normally, only about
15%-20% of GM dealers are unprofitable at this time of year.
   In an effort to shore up its dealer network, GM says it's
recently increased the assistance it gives to dealers to
finance the vehicles they stock. GM also announced it will
offer to repurchase the vehicles it sells to car-rental
companies, a move that will keep its dealers from having to
compete with cheaper used cars. Ford Motor Co. has followed
with a similar promise to its dealers.
   Dealerships like Menard, which sell many inexpensive
models, are among the hardest hit, experts say. These
economy-car dealers are pinched by the twin problems of
finding customers qualified for loans, and reaping thinner
profits on the vehicles they sell.

   BOSTON -- A federal judge here ruled that George V.
Koskotas, a Greek banker accused by the Greek government of a
scheme to embezzle $200 million, can be extradited to Greece.
   Judge Douglas Woodlock, upholding a magistrate's order
filed last year, said Mr. Koskotas, 35 years old, can be
extradited by the State Department to face charges that he
"misappropriated and embezzled" funds from the Bank of Crete
between 1986 and 1988, while he was serving as bank's
chairman, managing director and majority owner. Mr. Koskotas
has two months to appeal the decision.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Koskotas affair, as it is called in Greece, began
enveloping the government of former Greek Premier Andreas
Papandreou in the fall of 1988. Although Mr. Koskotas fled to
the U.S. where he was arrested by Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents, the banker's claims that he embezzled
the money with Mr. Papandreou's approval and deposited the
money in accounts of Mr. Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Party were a factor in the fall of the government last year.
   For the past 19 months, Mr. Koskotas has been in a Salem,
Mass., jail while his attorneys have filed motions to avoid
extradition. Among the claims overruled by Judge Woodlock are
that both the terrorist group called 17 November and the
Greek secret police are under orders to kill Mr. Koskotas.

   International Brief -- Lloyd's of London:
   Insurer Posts 22% Decline
   In Pretax Profit for 1987

<LP>
   Lloyd's of London posted a 22% decline in pretax profit
for 1987, and executives said the giant insurer faces leaner
times ahead.
   The decline, to pretax earnings of #509.2 million ($887
million) from a record #650 million in 1986, reflected
tighter underwriting conditions, higher expenses and huge
catastrophe losses in 1987. In that year, a series of storms
-- including a hurricane that swept Britain and Western
Europe in October -- led to higher claims.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a result, underwriting profit for the year fell 45%, to
#411.7 million, from #744.5 million. In particular, Lloyd's
said underwriting profit in its nonmarine lines was
"disappointing" at #8.7 million, a drop from #218.3 million a
year earlier.
   Lloyd's reports its results three years late to account
for the filing of claims and litigation. Profit from
underwriting and investment operations represents the
aggregate results of 401 syndicates back by 28,770 investors.
   Murray Lawrence, chairman of the 302-year-old insurer,
said Lloyd's continuing exposure to U.S. asbestos, pollution
and other so-called "long-tailed" liability policies makes
the 1988 and 1989 accounts look even "less satisfactory" than
1987. Profit in 1988 may be lower than 1987, in part due to
such disasters as the explosion aboard the Occidental
Petroleum North Sea oil platform.

   OTTAWA - The Canadian government temporarily shelved its
Hibernia oil project spending bill because of growing
anti-Newfoundland sentiment in the wake of Canada's failed
constitutional talks.
   Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the Hibernia
legislation has been postponed until the fall because a vote
now could have killed the bill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed bill would authorize the government to
contribute 2.7 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.3 billion) in
grants and loan guarantees to develop the Hibernia oil field
offshore Newfoundland.
   The government had planned to hold a vote on the spending
bill this week before it recesses for the summer holidays.
But it postponed the bill after several members of the Quebec
Parliament threatened to reject it in retaliation for
Newfoundland's failure last week to ratify the Meech Lake
accord.
   The Meech Lake Accord, which was designed to meet Quebec's
minimum constitutional demands and diffuse separatist
sentiment in the largely French-speaking province, died when
the Newfoundland and Manitoba legislatures adjourned without
ratifying it.

   WASHINGTON -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced
guidelines that will increase the amount of mildly
radioactive waste and other material that is exempt from NRC
regulation.
   This "below regulatory concern" approach is designed to
give the commissioners a uniform framework for granting
blanket exemptions covering such activities as the
decontamination of nuclear power plants, and such materials
as consumer products and low-level radioactive waste.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the past, the commission has granted exemptions on a
case-by-case basis to a few products. The NRC contends that
allowing for blanket exemptions will enable it to focus its
resources on more-serious risks.
   Consumer and environmental groups attacked the change,
saying it will result in excessive radiation exposure to
individuals and increase cancer deaths.
   Under the new policy, a material or practice can be
considered for exemption if it will result in an average
radiation dose to an individual of less than 10 millirems a
year. By comparison, a single round-trip cross-country
airline trip exposes an individual to about five millirems of
radiation, the NRC said.
   For consumer products or recycled materials, the dose
couldn't be above one millirem a year.

   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp., in a move to cut costs and create
efficiencies, said it is consolidating its Texas Oil &amp; Gas
Corp. operations with its larger and more profitable Marathon
Oil Co.
   The move was widely anticipated, after USX unsuccessfully
tried to sell all of the assets of Texas Oil &amp; Gas. But
instead of selling all six geographic packages of exploration
and production assets, it now expects to sell only three.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The unsold properties, including the subsidiaries Delhi
Gas Pipeline Corp. and FWA Drilling Co., will be combined
with Marathon's domestic exploration and production
operations. The two subsidiaries will continue to be managed
from Dallas and Wichita Falls, Texas, respectively.
   The company said it didn't know how many of Texas Oil &amp;
Gas's 2,000 employees would be affected by the consolidation.
But the greatest effect is expected in the unit's Dallas
headquarters staff and in distribution and sales-related
offices in California, Texas, Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast
area. Marathon had about 23,000 employees at year's end.
   USX also said it didn't know what, if any, charges could
be taken as a result of the move, or when the the
consolidation will be complete. A spokesman said the company
hopes savings from the consolidation will offset costs
related to the merged operations.
   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said the reorganization will
enable the company to "take advantage of numerous synergies
to reduce costs and optimize our capital budget and
exploration programs in the U.S."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
USX shares closed at $32.75, up 50 cents.

   MONTREAL -- BCE Inc., a telecommunications, manufacturing,

sell most of its 48.9% stake in Encor Inc., a Calgary,
Alberta, oil and gas company, to a group of investment
dealers for subsequent resale.
   After the stock market closed yesterday, BCE said it will
sell 14,850,600 units for seven Canadian dollars (US$5.97)
each to the dealers. Each unit consists of three Encor common
shares and two warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder to
purchase from BCE one Encor common share for C$2.65 until
Jan. 21, 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   BCE said it holds 74,253,930 Encor common shares. Upon the
sale of the units, its holding in Encor would be reduced to
29,702,130 shares, or about 19.6%, prior to the exercise of
the warrants. If all the warrants were exercised, BCE said,
its stake would be reduced to less than 1%.
   BCE said it continues to hold 29,850,000 Encor redeemable
convertible preferred shares. These shares are convertible
into 74,618,433 Encor common shares, or about 33% of the
total on a fully diluted basis.
   BCE said the sale of the units is expected to close on or
about July 20. It said proceeds will be used principally to
reduce short-term debt. BCE said the transaction won't have
an immediate effect on earnings.
   Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. and RBC Dominion
Securities Inc., both based in Toronto, are co-managers of
the dealer group, BCE said.

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission ordered
British Aerospace PLC to repay #44.4 million ($77.2 million)
in illegal state subsidies granted when the company bought
the state-owned car maker Rover Group PLC in 1988.
   The decision, announced by Sir Leon Brittan, EC
competition commissioner, follows the disclosure last year by
national auditors that the British government offered British
Aerospace "sweeteners," or hidden subsidies at the time of
the sale. These were to ensure British Aerospace went ahead
with its purchase of Rover after EC competition authorities
slashed a government aid package by #331 million to #469
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling is expected to fuel the political controversy
in Britain over the Rover affair, which has proved an
embarrassment to the government of Margaret Thatcher. Critics
accuse the British government of misleading Parliament as
well as EC authorities in offering the hidden subsidies to
British Aerospace.
   In London, the British government didn't immediately
comment on the commission's announcement, which is to be the
subject of a statement today in the House of Commons by Trade
and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley.
   British Aerospace also said it wouldn't comment on the
commission's decision before the government's statement to
Parliament.

   South Koreans Try to Build Image in U.S.

   SEOUL -- South Korea's conglomerates have a problem: Most
Americans don't know a Sunkyong from a SsangYong or a
Samsung.
   So the largest South Korean companies, including the three
sound-alike companies above, are planning to spend some $10
million on image ads in U.S. business publications this year.
Although not a lot of money, the spending boost marks a
growing awareness among South Korean companies that they have
to build a distinctive corporate image in the U.S., their
most important overseas market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We find that most Western guys don't know the names of
the groups," says Oke Dal Hyuk of LGAD Inc., the advertising
affiliate of Lucky-Goldstar Group. "We are all at the first
stage." Only Hyundai Group, which has thousands of cars on
U.S. roads acting as rolling billboards, has significant name
awareness in the U.S.
   Image advertising has become crucial to South Korean
companies because the U.S. prices of South Korean-made
products are quickly rising to match those of Japanese
imports. So South Korean companies must get consumers to
trust their brands the way they trust Japanese competitors'
names. "It is possible that foreigners might think that
Koreans are unreliable," says Lee Sang Chan of the public
relations and advertising department at SsangYong, a company
just beginning to sell a few of its products in the U.S.
under its own name. "Our goal is to plant a subconscious
image in the mind of the general public," he says.
   Because the South Korean companies' No. 1 goal is to find
overseas business partners, most of the image advertising is
aimed at business executives, not consumers. They want
overseas executives to use South Korea as a source of supply,
and even more importantly, to sell advanced technology to
South Korean companies so they'll be better able to compete.
   Making South Korean companies household names will be an
uphill battle. The companies tend to look alike because they
make many of the same things, each afraid to risk letting
another domestic company outflank them. Moreover, they tend
to run look-alike ads. A typical South Korean ad will mention
that the conglomerate is young, fast-growing, large and in
almost every business from petrochemicals and construction to
electronics and finance. And they usually use a bit of
nondescript but old-fashioned-looking artwork. "We don't have
much know-how in international marketing," says Oke of LGAD,
which recently spruced up its ad campaign for Lucky-Goldstar.
   As the companies spend more, they are becoming more
sophisticated. Once content to let the in-house staff design
the ads, more South Korean conglomerates are seeking outside
help. Samsung, for example, used Bozell Inc. to produce its
new $3 million world-wide ad campaign that features
photographs of four people from around the world who have
benefited from Samsung products.
   The best example of the improvement in South Korean ads is
Daewoo Group. Its first international campaign began in 1983,
the first for any South Korean company. "In terms of
advertising, the U.S. was a strange market for us," says Lee
Sung Bong, Daewoo's manager of international advertising and
public relations. So it sought the help of J.W. Thompson.
   This year, Daewoo took a giant leap forward. It decided
that instead of spending a certain percentage more each year,
it would spend as much as it takes to reach 50% of its
intended audience in major business publications. As a
result, it's increasing spending on image ads in the U.S.
100% to $4.5 million.
   Some South Korean companies aren't sure that image ads are
the way to go. Hyundai, which says it spent about $100
million on auto advertising last year, spends only $1.7
million telling people that "if you think we only make cars,
you're 21% correct." Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar, major
exporters of televisions and other electronic goods, each
spend about 5% of their $50 million overseas ad budgets on
corporate image ads.
   But Richard Winger, a partner at Boston Consulting Group
in New York, says, "For Korean companies that have just come
into the mainstream, image advertising makes a lot of sense."

   Cadillac Backs Conner
                                                                                                       

   General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division is putting $3
million behind Dennis Conner's 1992 quest to defend the
America's Cup.
   Cadillac in 1987 supported the New York Yacht Club's bid
for the prestigious cup but this time around decided to put
its name and technical support behind Mr. Conner, a four-time
America's Cup winner who was the skipper of Stars &amp; Stripes,
which recaptured the cup from Australia three years ago.
   "We want it to stay in the U.S.," said Peter Levin,
Cadillac's director of advertising. Cadillac chose to support
Mr. Conner because of his "focus, experience and ability to
successfully defend the cup," Mr. Levin said.
   Cadillac's early announcement may encourage other sponsors
to pledge their support sooner rather than later, Mr. Conner
said. He intends to build three boats in preparation for the
1992 yacht races, which will require some $30 million in cash
and other types of support from about 400 companies. "We have
several other equally important commitments, but Cadillac is
the first to announce," he said.
   Mr. Conner said he's "optimistic the goals will be reached
in a timely manner" but acknowledges that raising money for
these types of events is difficult these days. "Believe me,
corporate America is watching their pennies," he said.
"Cadillac looked at me very closely. There are a lot of other
worthy marketing opportunities out there, and they put me
through the hoops," he said.

   GARTNER TALKS: Saatchi's negotiations with its Gartner
consulting group unit, which is trying to buy itself back,
have been thrown into turmoil. Executives close to Gartner
said that the consulting firm had been progressing with plans
for a management buy-back, but that Saatchi -- without
notifying Gartner -- began negotiating with a third party.
"Things were coming together, and without any warning, a
third party got involved. Saatchi told Gartner at the last
minute," one person close to the talks said. Gartner declined
to comment. A Saatchi spokesman wouldn't comment on the third
party but said, "It isn't correct to say anything has been
broken off. Let's hope we don't have long to wait."

   Cosby Strikes Out; Robocop Meets Godzilla

   Just before the start of a sneak preview of Bill Cosby's
latest effort to overcome his unfortunate feature-film track
record, the babysitter of the two young boys sitting behind
me asked his charges if they knew what "Ghost Dad" was about.
"Ummmm, I saw the ad on TV," said the eight-year-old, in
between swallows of Gummi Bears. "Yeah," said the sitter.
"But what's the movie about?" Emboldened by the bears, the
boy concentrated a few seconds, then declared: "It's about
Bill Cosby]" As it turned out, this capsule review turned out
to be a perfect summary of the movie.
   "Ghost Dad" consists of Bill Cosby mugging in his Bill
Cosby way. Through his weekly television series he has become
a brand name, as recognizable as any of the numerous products
he advertises. The main difference between the movie and the
television series is the absence of the laugh track. This
should have seemed like an improvement. However, I started
yearning for those annoying programmed bleats so I'd have a
better idea of what the film makers thought was amusing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For those who have missed the commercials for the movie,
"Ghost Dad" is about Bill Cosby playing a widower, a father
of three children. He drowns and returns to his family as a
ghost who can be seen in the dark. This experience teaches
him his failings as a father and as a human being. Well,
okay. Some fine Hollywood pictures have evolved from
variations on this theme: "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" (1941) and
its 1978 remake, "Heaven Can Wait," immediately come to mind.
   "Ghost Dad," however, isn't a movie so much as a prolonged
situation comedy, the very thing that has made Mr. Cosby so
very successful on television. Like Mr. Cosby's weekly
series, the movie hops along from situation to situation,
carefully avoiding either emotional depths or comic highs.
When Mr. Cosby, for example, reveals to his already
motherless children that he has become a ghost (and that he
must be dead), they look slightly upset. Then they quickly
accept the situation and move on to the next thing.
   ---
   This is summer, so the next thing often is the same thing,
and so there it is: "Robocop 2." A great many people -- not I
-- adored Paul Verhoeven's original "Robocop," a bloody,
blackhearted satire of a future dominated by cynical
bureaucrats. I found the picture's sly malice overwhelmed by
the relentless barrage of brutality. Mr. Verhoeven's
box-office success was rewarded; he went on to apply his
technological bombast to "Total Recall," another gory
blockbuster. This left "Robocop 2" in the hands of Irwin
Kershner, who has dutifully tried to copy Mr. Verhoeven but
managed only to retain the crudeness and the violence.
   In the original, Peter Weller played a good cop in the
Detroit-of-the-future. He gets gunned down in the line of
duty. The wide-ranging and malevolent corporation that runs
the city transfers his few living parts -- mainly his brain
-- into a mechanism that approximates a merger of the Tin Man
and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He retains enough humanity to
resist the evil will of his creators and continues his
prerobotic impulse to preserve public order.
   He does this with ingeniously ruthless tactics that not
only incinerate his enemies but also mock the video age. The
sequel makers couldn't re-create Robocop, the thing that gave
the original its story. So they decided to make a sequel
within a sequel by constructing a second superpoliceman who
is part man, part machine. But Robocop 2 was constructed from
the remains of a very bad man, a drug dealer who has becalmed
the city with Nuke, a powerful narcotic. In their inevitable
struggle, these two metallic behemoths face off in a clunky
battle reminiscent of the Godzilla movies (and not much more
sophisticated despite the obviously extravagant expenditure
of funds on machinery).
   This plodding "Robocop 2" substitutes tastelessness for
energy and wit. Its big innovation: having small children
spew vile language to no apparent purpose.
   ---
   At another time the slight comedy called "Betsy's Wedding"
mightn't seem quite as appealing. But its affability and
simplicity come as welcome relief to the current onslaught of
noise and nonsense at the movies. Alan Alda wrote, directed
and starred in this story of an Italian contractor with a
redheaded wife (Madeline Kahn) and two redheaded daughters.
   His younger daughter, Betsy (Molly Ringwald), is the kind
of uninteresting young woman who tries to build something
into her character by wearing eccentric clothing. She is
about to get married. Connie (Ally Sheedy), the elder, is
genuinely eccentric. She is a policewoman, she explains,
because she gets a kick out of arresting people.
   As might be expected from an Alda project, this one has
its share of cutesy and self-conscious moments, mostly
involving Mr. Alda's character. He plays the contractor Eddie
Hopper (not to be confused with Elliot Hopper, the character
Mr. Cosby plays in "Ghost Dad"). The competition that arises
between him and the prospective groom's wealthy father for
control of their children's wedding bounces along breezily
enough. Most fun, however, are the ancillary stories that
have little to do with Betsy's wedding. Best is Anthony La
Paglia as Stevie Dee, the goofy yet endearing thug who falls
in love with Connie the cop. Stevie's taste in clothes and
everything else is strictly from Vegas, but his puppyish
pursuit of Connie has a charm all its own.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Spencer Tracy did the nervous dad routine with
his usual grace in "Father of the Bride." Elizabeth Taylor,
the bride, was simply gorgeous. Of course, the best wedding
moment in a movie occurs at the end of "The Graduate," and
the best moment in "Heartburn," also directed by Mike
Nichols, was the wedding.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida Federal Savings Bank said
that a U.S. District Court judge in Tampa, Fla., ordered
Florida Federal to pay $17 million of restitution and fined
the bank $2.2 million for its conviction of student-loan
fraud.
   In addition, the bank said that the Office of Thrift
Supervision has asked it to enter a consent agreement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Florida Federal was found guilty last month of falsifying
student-loan documents between November 1986 and May 1987.
   Judge Ben Krentzman also sentenced Robert O. Harmas, a
former Florida Federal officer, to two years in prison in
connection with the student-loan scandal. In addition, Judge
Krentzman placed James J. LaMantia, another former officer,
on probation for three years and ordered him to do 300 hours
of community service.
   "The court's recent decision defines a significant
component of the potential student-loan loss and, thereby,
helps clear the way for Florida Federal to be recapitalized,"
said the bank's president and chief executive officer, John
W. Sapankski.
   He added that "there are several investment groups
currently performing `due diligence' on Florida Federal, and
once the student loan uncertainty is quantified and settled,
we can look for investor commitments to be made."
   Mr. Sapanski said Florida Federal is also negotiating
settlements of the student-loan matter with the civil
division of the U.S. Justice Department and with the U.S.
Education Department.
   Mr. Sapanski said the Office of Thrift Supervision, which
has overseen Florida Federal under a supervisory agreement
for a year, has asked the bank to enter a more stringent
consent agreement, because its regulatory capital has fallen
below $15 million.

   New Jersey officials said IDS Financial Services Inc.
agreed to pay $1.2 million to clients who invested in a
securities scheme run by a former agent.
   IDS, based in Minneapolis, is the mutual fund and
financial planning arm of American Express Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The state attorney general's office said many of the
victims of the scheme were elderly, and that they will recoup
their entire investment if they accept IDS's offer.
   The attorney general's office said the agent, James Joyce,
of Trenton, and two other agents who acted as salesmen,
bilked 52 investors out of $2 million by illegally selling
them interests in J&amp;J Syndicate Inc., Trenton. It said IDS
wasn't aware of the scheme. The attorney general's office
said Mr. Joyce and one agent, Gerald L. Weiss, of Neptune,
N.J., were fired in 1986. The attorney general's office said
the third agent, Christoper DeBenedetto, Lambertville, N.J.,
was fired in February 1989.
   The state's Bureau of Securities filed suit against Mr.
Joyce in May 1989; he later fled the country and is still a
fugitive, according to the attorney general's office. A state
judge ordered him to disgorge all profits, return all funds
to investors, and levied more than $1.2 million in penalties.
State officials said the cases against Messrs. Weiss and
DeBenedetto are continuing.
   An IDS spokeswoman said, "We feel strongly that IDS was a
victim, like the clients." She called the $1.2 million
payment "an investment in our reputation." She said IDS
didn't expect to make further payments. New Jersey officials
said in their statement, however, that bilked investors are
still entitled to take their cases to court or arbitration.

   Trump Girl: Donald's Latest Venture Is a Brunette

   New York -- No matter what else happened, the day wouldn't
be a total loss for Joanne Shapiro. She'd barely arrived at a
Broadway studio to audition for the Trump Girl, the name
given the hostess of "Trump Card," a syndicated game show
named after you know who debuting this fall, and wow (there's
no business like show business), she bumped smack into Robert
Goulet. "I'm doy-ing," gasped the 28-year-old who was wearing
blond hair and a short off-the-shoulder black dress. "He's
still very good looking. I gave him a kiss and my picture."
   Meeting Mr. Goulet was an omen of good things to come,
figured Ms. Shapiro. That and the fact that she knew Donald
Trump's mother. Knew her personally. "And she is a DOLL,"
enthused Ms. Shapiro, who runs Blondie's, a Jamaica, Queens,
boutique patronized by Mother Trump. "But the store is just a
side thing. I've seen Donald," she added. "He's always
dressed very nice."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to Thomas L. Cantone, vice president of
entertainment for Trump Atlantic City Properties. "Trump
Card," which will be taped at Trump Castle Hotel and Casino,
is modeled after "Full House," a Bingo-style game show that
had a successful run on British TV. Its American developer,
Lorimar Television, which claims a commitment from 90
stations so far, made a presentation to Mr. Cantone, who in
turn pitched the idea to Mr. Trump. "He liked it
immediately," noted Mr. Cantone, one of four judges at the
session.
   "We didn't want to restrict ourselves," he said of the
decision to make the audition an open call. "We wanted to
give everyone a chance to be seen."
   Admittedly, the judges were not quite sure what they
wanted in a hostess. It came down to a certain gleam in the
eye, a certain intangible something, a certain Vanna-be
quality. "You'd like friendliness and warmth," said Barbara
Miller, a Lorimar senior vice president, who would capture on
videotape those women whose friendliness and warmth merited a
second look.
   "We really have no idea what we're looking for but I know
what we're not looking for. I don't want someone who's hard
looking. I don't want a show girl. We know we want somebody
pretty. And you'd like a little intelligence."
   While Ms. Miller acknowledged that there is little overlap
between the skills required for the Trump Girl and those
required for, say, rocket science, "this is not as easy as
everyone thinks," she insisted. "While you're just standing
there you have to look like you're doing something. What
Vanna White has is that she'll stand there but she's really
involved," said Ms. Miller. "She's excited for the
contestant."
   During the two-day screening, the judges learned a few
things. They learned that hope springs eternal in the female
breast and that the delicatessen down the street is incapable
of getting a lunch order straight. They also learned the
utility of keeping their facial expressions as bland as
American cheese. This last skill came in especially handy
when the panel was confronted by a 50-year-old in tap shoes
who did a soft shoe and listed four different names on her
application: her acting name, her poetry-writing name, her
dancing name and her holistic name. "There's no reason the
Trump Girl can't be an old lady," she said, shuffling off to
Buffalo. "She doesn't have to be young."
   Three by three the women came in, some clutching
professionally shot 8-by-10 glossies, some carrying snapshots
taken by their next of kin. Mostly they were would-be models
and actresses anxious to shake hands with whoever seemed the
most influential member of the paper-shuffling panel.
   There was a card dealer from Trump Castle, looking for a
job upgrade and a third-grade teacher in a turquoise dress
that hugged her body until it cried "Uncle."
   "My third-grade teacher never looked liked that," said
Trump Castle's Mr. Cantone as the educator tottered out in
her purple pumps.
   Next came a recent high school graduate and a college
freshman to whom Ms. Miller stressed the importance of a good
education. And there was a woman, who, as she explained, was
not a model, actress, dancer or singer but rather a
production assistant from Philadelphia. "I called in sick to
come here," said the woman, whose makeup was by
Sherwin-Williams and whose name is being witheld for the sake
of her continued employment in Philadelphia.
   The demands on the finalists would be more onerous --
they'd participate in a mock run-through of "Trump Card" with
its host, former Miami Dolphins football star Jimmy Cefalo --
but the open call was a cakewalk. Applicants were asked how
they heard about the job (they read about it in "Variety"),
whether it sounded interesting (they said it did). Then they
were asked to do an about face -- "so we can see how pretty
you look," said Ms. Miller -- walk toward the mirrors and
execute a turn. Admittedly, this turning business confounded
some of the girls who weren't sure in which direction to
turn, what to do with their arms while they were turning or
what to do once they successfully negotiated the turn.
   "That's it. Thank you so much. We'll let you know," Ms.
Miller said smoothly except on those few occasions when she
wanted to put someone on videotape. "I came all the way from
Long Island for this," mourned one contestant who didn't make
the cut.
   "I'm going to go home and beat somebody up," said Ms.
Miller after nodding yet another warm farewell to yet another
trio of women so unappealing it was doubtful that even the
tide would take them out. "This is spoiling me for open
calls."
   Out in the reception area, there was much speculation
about what the job entailed. "I think it would be a lot of
dealing with people one-on-one," said Stephanie Milewski, 21,
who views dealing with people one-on-one as one of her
principal strengths.
   "It sounds like a Vanna White thing," said model Shay
Hunter.
   "I hope it entails more responsibility than she has," said
one responsible-looking actress.
   "I don't think Vanna's so great," said Joanne Shapiro.
   Rumor had it that Donald Trump himself -- schedule and
creditors permitting -- would breeze by to have a look at
prospective Trump Girls and offer his two cents. Although
many of those questioned professed a lack of interest in the
man and his millions and his recent financial troubles,
appearances told a different story. There were enough Marla
Maples and Ivana look-a-likes to fill Trump Tower. "He's like
a character out of a novel Jackie Collins would write," noted
a dazzling blond model, Sheri Montgomery ("as in Ward,
General and Elizabeth"), "Millions, billions, wife, children,
mistress . . ."
   "Do you think he is looking for Marla?" asked a
dark-haired young woman."Maybe I'd better just go home."
   "Being blond helps," believed blond Sharon O'Brien. "He
likes blondes, doesn't he? That's what I hear." (As a matter
of fact, Southern brunette Debi Massey prevailed in the end.)
   What would the women say to Mr. Trump if he walked in
right this very minute and joined the judge's panel? "Nice to
meet you," said Ms. Montgomery.
   "Go ahead, Donald, choose me," said actress Tanesha Gary,
opting for a direct approach to the art of the deal. "You
know I'm who you want."

   National Institutes of Health Faces Host
   Of Ills as Demand for Research Surges

   WASHINGTON -- The quiet pursuit of medical research at the
National Institutes of Health is being interrupted these days
by increasingly noisy discontent.
   Yesterday, hundreds of AIDS activists shouting "Shame,
shame" demonstrated at NIH's Bethesda, Md., campus to demand
much higher funding for research into AIDS and related
diseases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The protests reflect a host of fiscal and political
problems at NIH that threaten to blunt its edge as the
world's leading medical research organization. Widening
budget demands are limiting its ability to fund qualified
research projects, and below-market salaries are making it
hard to retain bright young scientists. Meantime, the Bush
administration's anti-abortion politics forced out the NIH's
director last July, and fears that politics, not science,
will shape future research priorities have made it tough to
recruit a replacement.
   "This is happening at the worst time," says Edward
Schneider, a gerontologist at the University of Southern
California. "The Japanese have targeted biomedical research
because they know that the spinoff for pharmaceuticals is
enormous," he says. "We don't have that many fields in which
we are really ahead of the Japanese and the West Europeans,"
and it would be tragic to squander that lead, Dr. Schneider
says.
   NIH pays senior research physicians about 50% less than
they could make at universities or in industry. As a result,
the NIH has 28% fewer senior researchers than a decade ago
and hasn't been able to hire a single senior researcher from
outside the government to run a lab. All of NIH's
neurosurgeons have left for higher-paying jobs, forcing the
agency to contract out operations to local medical schools.
"The NIH brain drain is a national tragedy," says Rep. Silvio
Conte, a Massachusetts Republican. "Soon NIH will mean Nobody
Is Here."
   Although NIH's annual budget has more than doubled to $7.6
billion in the past decade, much of the new money has gone
toward AIDS research, an ambitious project to map the human
genetic system and compliance with a new law to protect
animals used in research. Overall, NIH, which supports
science in universities across the country, can fund only 25%
of projects approved as justified by NIH peer review groups,
down from 40% in 1980. "A lot of good ideas are going
unfunded," says John Sherman, executive vice president of the
Association of American Medical Colleges.
   The Alliance for Aging Research, a group established to
improve the health of the elderly, says budget restraints are
preventing the National Institute on Aging from funding
promising projects that could lead to new therapies for
osteoporosis and ways to improve balance, both of which could
help reduce broken bones suffered from falls. The National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has a
list of 18 clinical trials it can't fund to study such issues
as the treatment of hypertension renal disease in blacks and
the role of diet and exercise in the treatment of noninsulin
dependent diabetes.
   The AIDS demonstrators yesterday demanded twice as much
money for NIH to pursue speedier development of new
treatments for AIDS and a broader search for treatments for
cancer and dozens of other diseases that strike people with
AIDS. But Anthony Fauci, the director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which conducts
AIDS research, warned that the demonstrations could backfire.
"I think there may ultimately be a backlash. People are
thinking that we're doing too much for AIDS relative to other
diseases. This could undermine their efforts."
   Congress and the administration are studying ways to
strengthen NIH, but the immediate challenge is to find a
prominent scientist to head the research center. Last summer
the Bush administration removed NIH Director James Wyngaarden
after seven years on the job. Dr. Wyngaarden differed with
the administration on abortion and research involving fetal
tissue transplants that could lead to treatments for such
degenerative diseases as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
   The administration has blocked federal funding of this
research out of fear that success could boost the demand for
aborted fetuses. "To ban areas of investigation for political
reasons is regrettable," says David Korn, dean of the
Stanford University Medical School. "It's an area of great
promise that essentially is obliterated from the American
repertoire." Rep. Ted Weiss, a New York Democrat who is
chairman of the House panel that oversees NIH, says the
removal of Dr. Wyngaarden contributed to a "sense that
politics rather than science drives health research."
   But the biggest problem arose last fall, when a White
House official queried candidates for the NIH job about their
views on abortion and fetal tissue research. Word immediately
circulated that the administration was imposing an
ideological litmus test, and several candidates rejected the
post. Dr. Schneider blames the administration's inability to
fill the NIH job on "the whole abortion issue."
   Even Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
concedes that the administration's handling of the initial
search "has frankly been an embarrassment." Others are
harsher. "The NIH has suffered a severe and needless setback
because of politics and ideology entering into who should be
director," complains Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who
heads the Senate Appropriations Committee panel that funds
NIH.
   Dr. Sullivan has tried to repair the damage. After talks
at the White House, he announced last fall that "standards of
scientific and administrative excellence and leadership," not
politics, would prevail in the selection process. He also
appointed an advisory committee to suggest ways to make the
NIH post more attractive.
   The panel, expected to issue its report soon, will
recommend giving the NIH director a fixed six-year term to
insulate the post from political pressure, new authority to
target funds on areas where breakthroughs appear imminent,
greater influence over policy, a reduction in red tape and a
much higher salary. Dr. Sullivan hopes the prospect of such
changes will make finding an NIH chief easier when he resumes
the search in a few weeks.
   Congress is likely to support these changes. Rep. Conte
and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts have
introduced a bill to raise NIH salaries to make them more
competitive. Currently, the head of NIH makes about $100,000,
about half of what medical school department heads earn. The
bill, which has growing support in both the House and the
Senate, also would raise starting salaries for doctors at NIH
to $60,000 from $37,000. Sen. Harkin notes that at a time
when doctors leave medical school with tuition debts
averaging $42,000, many can't afford to choose research over
medical practice.
   In recent years, Congress has treated NIH generously,
generally adding several hundred million dollars to the
administration's budget request. The Bush administration
requested $7.93 billion for NIH in fiscal year 1991, which
starts Oct. 1, or $350 million more than in the current year.
But Congress seems headed toward a $750 million increase.
Still, this is less than the $1.65 billion increase that the
research community wants.
   Rep. Conte, who is the ranking minority member on the
House Appropriations Committee, faults the administration for
slighting NIH and medical research. During a recent budget
meeting at the White House, he says he told President Bush
that "you've got to do something at NIH." The response? "He
just shook his head," Rep. Conte says. "The meeting ended,
and they threw me out."
