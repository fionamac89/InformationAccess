   EAST HANOVER, N.J. -- Ultimate Corp., which rebuffed a
takeover bid last year, may have yet a second bidder --
Theodore M. Sabarese, its former chairman and the man who
founded the computer-systems company 12 years ago.
   Mr. Sabarese built the company up, but later saw the
company's fortunes sag and his own culminate in a personal
filing under the bankruptcy laws. Last week, he disclosed to
the Securities and Exchange Commission that he is
contemplating making an offer for the company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Sabarese also said he may nominate a slate of
directors for election at Ultimate's annual meeting Aug. 14.
   The announcement comes on the heels of one by the investor
Norman Elowitz, chairman of the New York women's-apparel
concern Honey Fashions Ltd. Mr. Elowitz, who made a
$10-a-share takeover proposal to Ultimate in November and was
rebuffed, recently said he may make a new, unspecified bid.
   In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Ultimate's shares closed at $7, up 62.5 cents.
   "I wish Mr. Sabarese luck. I'm not going away, and I'm
proceeding with my plan," Mr. Elowitz said Friday. "I've put
a confirmed, about $100 million, offer for the company on the
table" and "I hope in the future to make some sort of
friendly arrangement that will benefit all shareholders." Mr.
Elowitz holds about 686,000, or 7.2%, of Ultimate's 9.5
million shares outstanding.
   For Ultimate's part, "the company's not for sale," said
Chairman Michael O'Donnell. But the executive reiterated that
the board would review legitimate takeover proposals as part
of its fiduciary duty to shareholders.
   Mr. Sabarese couldn't be reached for comment.
   Last June, Mr. Sabarese resigned as chairman of Ultimate
and also made a personal filing under the bankruptcy laws in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark, N.J. The executive listed
$18.8 million of assets and $30.7 million of liabilities.
   In his SEC filing, Mr. Sabarese said he holds 626,400
Ultimate shares, about a 6.6% stake. But he also said that he
settled a claim by Midlantic National Bank against him by
agreeing to pay the bank 575,000 Ultimate shares. The court
approved the settlement May 3, and the filing said the
approval is expected to become final on May 16. Midlantic
National Bank is a unit of Edison, N.J.-based Midlantic Corp.
   For the third quarter ended Jan. 31, Ultimate reported a
net loss of $1.7 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with
net income ot $3.5 million, or 36 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue dipped 2% to $50.7 million.

   Food Stamps Fail
   To Cover Needs
   Of the Rural Poor
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- The nation's rural poor are going hungry
because food-stamp benefits aren't enough to cover higher
food costs in impoverished rural counties, a new consumer
survey shows.
   Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a
Washington-based consumer group, says that of nine million
rural Americans living in poverty, many are food-stamp
recipients who are paying higher prices for fewer calories
than the poor in cities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its survey of 33 counties with a 25% poverty rate, the
group found that the weekly $75 food-stamp allotment for a
household of four isn't adequate to buy all of the food in
the government's "thrifty food plan," which is regarded as
the minimum diet from a nutrition standpoint. It takes $102 a
week to buy the thrifty food plan if food-stamp recipients
don't have access to competitively priced supermarkets and
must shop at higher priced mom-and-pop stores, according to
the survey.
   What's more, even at rural supermarkets, the average cost
of foods in the thrifty plan is 8% higher than the $75
allotment, the survey shows.
   Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice, faults the
Agriculture Department, which administers the food-stamp
program, for failing to take the urban-rural price
differences into account.
   The results of the national survey, conducted last year,
will strengthen the hand of Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
and other lawmakers who are pushing hunger-relief measures
this year in Congress. The group also found that one of every
three food-stamp dollars in poor areas is spent in crossroads
stores and small-town grocery stores where supplies of fresh
produce and meat are limited. Last summer, 23% of the stores
surveyed didn't stock any fresh vegetables and 33% didn't
stock any fresh fruits, while 30% didn't sell fresh meats.
   In its survey, the group recommends increasing food-stamp
allotments 17% by fiscal 1995 to boost the poor's purchasing
power and re-evaluating the Agriculture Department's methods
for determining food-stamp benefits. In addition, it calls
for federal grants to help small rural stores set up
wholesale-purchasing cooperatives and become more
price-competitive with supermarkets.

   U.S. Firms Trading With China Fear
   Removal of Most-Favored-Nation Status

   NEW YORK -- U.S. businesses involved in trade with China
are raising an alarm over the possible elimination of China's
most-favored-nation trade status.
   Fearing the U.S. will refuse to renew the MFN status for
political reasons, business associations and individual
companies are launching campaigns to warn of the impact on
U.S.-China trade and on U.S. consumers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a letter sent to its members, Congress and the White
House, the American Association of Exporters and Importers
estimated that the removal of MFN status would boost tariffs
on goods from China an average 40%. A 21-page report
distributed by the United States-China Business Council
offers examples: Some imported pants that currently are
subject to a 17.7% duty would face a 90% tariff. Some toys
would be taxed at 70% compared with the current 6.8%.
   Many members of Congress are bent on slapping the Beijing
leadership for its brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement last June, and the MFN status provides a powerful
and timely weapon. But it's uncertain if that view would
prevail if President Bush, as expected, extends most-favored
trading status for China. If the legislators object and pass
a resolution revoking MFN status for China, Mr. Bush could
veto it; congressional staffers who follow the issue say it
would be difficult for Congress to muster the two-thirds vote
to override a veto. Mr. Bush isn't expected to disclose his
decision until close to the June 3 deadline.
   In a series of interviews, people here who do business in
China expressed outrage at the Beijing government's actions
in Tiananmen Square last year. But they argued that a rebuke
of Beijing is a foreign policy matter that should be kept
separate from the trade issue. "We recognize what the Chinese
government did to its people," said Kathleen Syron of the
U.S.-China Business Council. "We're not against some form of
punishment. But don't use MFN."
   Any change in China's trade status could hit importers
with rising costs, either because of the higher tariffs or
higher prices for supplies in other countries. That, in turn,
could mean higher prices to American consumers. At the same
time, a drop in China's shipments to the U.S. would further
shrink the country's foreign-exchange reserves and reduce its
ability to pay for American exports. U.S. exporters such as
wheat growers and aircraft manufacturers could suffer an
additional hardship if the the Chinese leadership should
retaliate and refuse to buy U.S. goods.
   The debate will heat up on Wednesday and on May 23, when
the House Foreign Affairs Committee convenes hearings on the
issue. By June 3, one day before the anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square massacre, President Bush must notify
Congress whether or not he intends to seek a renewal of
China's MFN treatment. China's MFN status expires July 3.
   The U.S. extends MFN status, which entitles a country to
favorable tariffs, to nearly all its trading partners. Even
such countries as South Africa, Iraq and Syria are accorded
MFN trade status. Only 16 nations, including North Korea,
Cuba and the Soviet Union, don't receive MFN benefits. "MFN
sounds like a privilege," said Ms. Syron of the
Washington-based United States-China Business Council. "But
actually it's not."
   The elimination of MFN for China would come at a
particularly bad time for both U.S. textile importers and
apparel consumers. Several recent U.S. decisions could impose
higher tariffs on a broad range of textile goods, causing
prices to rise. In one case, the Commerce Department last
month issued a preliminary decision against South Korea,
Taiwan and Hong Kong that could result in anti-dumping duties
on those countries' synthetic-fiber sweaters. In addition,
India recently was singled out as an unfair trading partner.
Among India's chief exports to the U.S. is clothing.
   Clint Stack, president of International Development
Systems Inc., a Washington-based textile consulting firm,
calculates that the combination of the anti-dumping duties,
the revocation of China's MFN status and the Indian case
would have a severe impact on the U.S. consumer.
   "You could end up with 20% of the total U.S. textile
apparel imports being subjected to significantly higher duty
rates," he said. China's textile and apparel imports account
for 13% of the total.
   Tariffs wouldn't be the only cause of higher prices. If
textile importers sought to avoid the higher duties by
sourcing goods elsewhere, business people say other countries
would likely raise their prices.

   Real Artists Don't Take Handouts

   The Robert Mapplethorpe brouhaha has rapidly degenerated
into caricature. Flying the flag of truth, beauty and the
First Amendment is the culture establishment, righteously
striving "to save the atmosphere for creative freedom of
artists," in Congressman Pat Williams's (D., Mont.) words.
The barbarians at the gate are a motley crew of right-wing
philistines and homophobes, faces plastered with unctuous
censor's smiles.
   How depressingly incomplete this picture is.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   You'd never know it from watching CSPAN, but there are
actually writers and artists in the American heartland who
want nothing to do with the National Endowment for the Arts.
We think that government subsidy is corrupting and crippling,
suitable only for fat and happy eunuchs. Our creed was best
expressed by Oxford, Miss.'s native son, William Faulkner,
who said, "The writer doesn't need economic freedom. All he
needs is a pencil and paper. I've never known anything good
in writing to come from having accepted any free gift of
money. The good writer never applies to a foundation. He's
too busy writing something."
   Faulkner's disdain for grant-grubbing is echoed by many of
our finest contemporary writers, from Gore Vidal to the late
great desert maverick Edward Abbey. The NEA's chosen few are
made docile by the dole; Beat impresario Lawrence
Ferlinghetti scorns them as "cooperating poets and
publishers."
   Is it then the artist's lot to starve and scrape, to eat
rice and home-baked bread and scribble feverishly in the
darkest hours? Yes] Comforted, coddled, cossetted artists
create mediocre art. That's their right, of course, but why
should the taxpayer get stuck with the bill?
   Can anyone name one major piece of American fiction that
would not have been written without the NEA's beneficence?
How about a significant minor work?
   Moreover, NEA grants are not "free." Uncle Sam is like any
other sugar daddy: he's got a generous touch, but sooner or
later he's gonna demand service. Andres Serrano, photographer
of the ineffable "Piss Christ," should have thought about the
dangers of subsidy before he cashed that $15,000 check.
   How dismaying it is to watch novelists and poets troop
before television cameras and beg for taxpayer dollars with
all the dignity of defense contractors. I expect that of the
arts bureaucrats, who are, after all, merely trying to save
their jobs. But what in hell are Garrison Keillor and Larry
McMurtry doing at the microphones? Since when did pork barrel
for the hyper-literate become a matter of principle?
   Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R.,
Calif.) could have enlisted a fair-sized contingent of
writers and artists to support their battle against the NEA.
Alas, they wound up making all the wrong arguments. They
dragged that old bugbear homosexuality out of the closet for
yet another public flogging. They spoke fatuously of art that
"glorifies" America: not the real America, which Whitman
rhapsodized in his (unsubsidized) "Leaves of Grass," but a
"Top Gun" America, an aseptic place agleam with military
hardware.
   This may shock Mr. Helms and Mr. Rohrabacher, but America
has a rich literary tradition, predating even Tom Clancy. The
two great flowerings of our national letters, in the 1850s
and 1920s, occurred without any help from a ministry of
culture. Whitman, Thoreau, Poe, Melville, Stowe, Hawthorne .
. . not an NEA grantee in the bunch. Their grey eminence,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, spoke to them and to writers unborn: "If
you would learn to write, `tis in the street you must learn
it. . . . The people, and not the college, is the writer's
home."
   And poverty is the writer's lot. (Until the mortgage
becomes just too scary, and our noble young novelist slinks
off to Hollywood, and the sun rather quickly sets.)
   If Thoreau can write "Walden" and Melville can produce
"Moby Dick" without Uncle Sam's patronage, then surely Robert
Mapplethorpe's claque can express themselves without a
government handout. Better to be poor and free than in the
culture establishment's hip pocket.

   TORRANCE, Calif. -- A unit of Banner Industries Inc.'s
Fairchild Industries Inc. subsidiary pleaded guilty to
federal charges of conspiring to falsify test reports on
special nuts, bolts and other fasteners used on most U.S.
commercial and military aircraft.
   Fairchild's VSI Corp. on Friday agreed to pay a fine of
$2.5 million and reimburse the government for about $1
million for the costs of the investigation. In addition, VSI
agreed to pay $14.5 million to the government, part of which
will be distributed to former employees who brought
allegation of wrongdoing to federal investigators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce D. Carter brought
charges against Fairchild's Voi-Shan testing laboratory in
Chatsworth, Calif., a unit of VSI, and two of its managers in
a complaint filed in federal court in Seattle.
   Documents cite numerous instances in which Voi-Shan
allegedly failed to conduct tests of strength, durability and
brittleness. The unit allegedly produced reports approved by
a fictitious inspector indicating that such tests had been
properly performed in an attempt to hold down costs and boost
profits, according to court documents.
   "Any breach of government inspection procedures is a very
serious matter," said Ben W. Prescott, newly appointed
president of the Fairchild Fasteners Group. He said the
company has "taken steps to prevent such conduct from ever
taking place again."
   Customers include such major aircraft and engine
manufacturers as Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
Lockheed Corp., General Electric Co. and United Technologies
Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney Co. subsidiary.
   The complaint also names as defendants James E. Ryan, a
former Voi-Shan quality-assurance manager, and Aram
Marderian, a former metallurgical lab supervisor for
Voi-Shan. If convicted, each faces a maximum sentence of five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Neither could be reached
for comment.

   China's Iron-Fisted Population Control
   ----

   In September 1987, an expectant Chinese couple temporarily
residing in the U.S. received a note from a factory back home
where the wife worked. It wasn't a baby shower invitation.
   The Walfantia Bearing Factory warned the couple that their
pregnancy was unauthorized and that everyone from "the
factory director . . . to the cadres in charge of the birth
control program" would be punished if the baby was born.
Because the "consequences for you are unthinkable," the
factory authorities ominously warned, "you should . . . fix
your problem any way you can. You must not delay] If you have
real difficulties, return to China immediately for an
abortion. . . ."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This international direct-mail program is just one of the
dark aspects of the Chinese Communist Party's ferocious
population-control effort, and just one of the grim details
John Aird, the Census Bureau's former authority on China,
provides in "Slaughter of the Innocents" (The American
Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 191 pages,
$16.95).
   Far from being a blessed event, nearly every birth in
China is viewed with a jaundiced eye because it might violate
the population policy, which evolved during some 30 years
after Mao Tse-tung broke with traditionally optimistic
Marxist thinking on large populations.
   "It is a very good thing that China has a big population,"
Mao wrote in 1949. "Of all the things in the world, people
are the most precious." But as the utopian vision of a
communist Promised Land faded away, Mao was less prepared to
let a thousand flowers bloom. By 1955 he was warning that
unfettered population growth could lead to the "extinction"
of the Chinese race.
   Thus he set in motion a program to help the Chinese
overcome their "feudal mentality" and "conservative tendency"
toward large families and adopt "birth plans." Yet even under
Mao's iron fist, birth-control efforts in China during the
1950s and 1960s were fairly mild.
   Then in the 1970s a new anti-natalist campaign required
local authorities to make planned parenthood and birth
control part of the "class struggle." Opponents became (and
today remain) "class enemies," Mr. Aird writes, and Beijing's
birth directives grew increasingly more draconian. In 1979,
with China's population taking a great leap forward, the
authorities explicitly defined the state's interest: zero
population growth by the year 2000.
   Mr. Aird convincingly shows that China's government has
been willing to do just about anything to reach that goal,
justifying their efforts with the neo-Malthusian idea that
people inhibit economic growth. That Hong Kong supports a
vastly denser population is clearly of no interest to
functionaries pursuing an economic system that is in fact
directly responsible for China's woes. "Whether we can
strictly control population growth," Mr. Aird quotes the
People's Daily, "will directly determine whether we can
smoothly achieve our economic development objectives." And so
the Forbidden City's geriatric potentates prohibit "early
marriages, early births" and decree forced sterilization and
compulsory abortion. "Use whatever means you must," Deng
Xiaoping urged in 1981, "but do it."
   Far from stopping at huge fines and cutting off a family's
water and electricity supply for begetting an unauthorized
child, the Communist Party has outlawed removing an
intrauterine device. And while pregnant Chinese nationals
living abroad receive letters urging abortions, women on the
home front are treated to "study classes" and
"heart-to-heart" talks during which birth control cadres
press them into an abortion, followed by IUD insertion or
sterilization.
   Doctors now storm through villages on abortion and
sterilization raids. To preserve the "happy peace" that
state-sponsored birth-control efforts bring to the people,
Mr. Aird writes, China has even "destroyed infants by
injections of alcohol into the fontanel" and by stuffing
gauze into their mouths.
   The population control lobby will no doubt condemn
"Slaughter of the Innocents" not only for the beam it shines
on China's program, but also because Mr. Aird attacks this
group in the book's opening chapter. Even as Chinese
authorities committed mass infanticide, the United Nations
Population Fund enthusiastically bestowed awards and money on
a program it averred was "totally voluntary." Others less
sanguine about China's zealous quest merely call the program
"aggressive" or "rigorous."
   But as recently as last year, China permitted the
publication of articles demanding coercive sterilization and
compulsory abortion for all women under 24, all second
pregnancies spaced less than five years after the first and
all third pregnancies.
   John Aird deserves acclaim not only for his painstaking
academic research on a difficult subject, but also for
dispassionately exposing China's brutal methods. The question
is whether the population control movement that has
championed China's model will learn something from it.

   LAGUNA HILLS, Calif. -- Advantage Life Products Inc. said
it expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and profit to be
comparable to its third-quarter results and below analysts'
expectations because of a major customer's financial
problems.
   The customer, Ames Department Stores Inc., recently sought
bankruptcy-law protection while it reorganizes to pay its
debts. Advantage Life, a distributor of smoking cessation
products, said that over the past 12 months, Ames has
accounted for about 15% of its revenue.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Advantage Life reported net income of $350,000, or seven
cents a share, on revenue of $3.1 million in its third
quarter ended Jan. 31. In the fourth quarter ended April 30,
1989, the company had income of $323,000, or seven cents a
share, on revenue of $2.1 million. The company didn't pay any
taxes in the year-ago quarter.
   Advantage Life said Ames owes about $360,000 from the
purchase of anti-smoking kits. Ames also has ordered between
$250,000 and $300,000 of smoking-deterrent gum that Advantage
Life said it expected to deliver last month; now the company
expects to deliver in the current quarter.
   "The long-term impact on Advantage sales will depend on
(Ames's) reorganization plan," said William W.F. Cowie,
Advantage Life chief financial officer. "The filing will have
no short-term impact on the company's viability," he said.
Advantage Life said it expects its Ames business to continue,
but at lower levels.

   SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Industrial production in Bulgaria fell
8.5% in the first four months of this year, and there is no
prospect of swift improvement, the state news agency BTA
said.
   Last month, Bulgaria announced it was stopping payments on
the principle of its $10 billion foreign debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Figures published by BTA suggested the economic crisis,
which is giving rise to increasing consumer shortages, will
not ease soon.
   The worst-hit industries are mechanical engineering,
metals, chemicals, oil refining and food processing, BTA
said. At least 7,000 workers have been laid off due to
closures of firms and production lines, it said.

in July.
   Mr. Payne, 54 years old, is also an executive vice

a successor to him. Mr. Payne, who was named chief financial
officer last year, was formerly president of the concern's
Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Payne said he decided to take early retirement because
"my family is still in Hartford, and I feel it's time to go
back and join them. I always considered (the role of chief
financial officer) a short-term appointment."
   Bank of New England, hard hit by bad real estate loans,
has undergone a series of top management changes during the
past few months as federal bank regulators have worked to
rectify its problems.

   BASTOGNE, Belgium -- On a hill overlooking the tranquil
Ardennes countryside near here there stands a memorial to the
76,000 Americans who died or were wounded in the Battle of
the Bulge. Around the monument's upper rim, the names of all
the American states are writ large and on its columns are
listed the American units that fought here in that Christmas
season of 1944: the 10th Armored, the 101st Airborne, the
28th Infantry, etc. There is little recognition of the
100,000 German casualties, but non-recognition of fallen
warriors is one of the small prices vanquished nations pay.
   We all know about the large prices Germany has paid since
Gen. Hasso von Manteuffel's Panzers failed to dislodge the
Americans at Bastogne. Hitler's hopes of driving a wedge
through the Allies were dashed, with heavy losses, destroying
any possibility of a negotiated peace. From there Germany
would go on to total defeat, massive loss of property and
lives, postwar destitution and the splitting of its people
between two armed camps, NATO and the Soviet-controlled
Warsaw Pact. Now, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
demanding that the final bill, too, be marked paid, allowing
the Germans once more to have a reunited, sovereign nation.
After a half-century, World War II will finally have ended.

   Or will it? History is episodic, and we are now witnessing
a dramatic chapter in European history as the empire built by
the Soviet Union out of its World War II conquests crumbles
away, removing the final cruel legacies of that great 1940s
struggle. It is a time of rejoicing in capitals that have
known darkness so long -- Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and
Berlin. But provocative rhetoric about "the end of history"
to the contrary, history also is a continuum. Policy makers
in Moscow, other European capitals and the U.S. are trying to
fathom the implications of what is happening before their
eyes and to bring influence to bear on the next chapter. Only
those people who think that the world suddenly has become a
safe place will think that this process is not crucial to
future peace.
   The most immediate questions center as usual on the
intentions and capabilities of the Soviet Union. Is it really
collapsing, and if so is Mr. Kohl in a strong position to get
his way in the "two-plus-four" negotiations over a unified
Germany's future? The only remaining obstacle before Mr. Kohl
is the Soviet suggestion, made at the first two-plus-four
gathering May 5, that the question of a united Germany's
military alliances be left unresolved for several years. Mr.
Kohl thought that sounded like a trick. He says that Germany
itself has decided on its alliances and it will be a part of
NATO. That means that the 380,000 Soviet troops stationed in
East Germany will have to leave. Mr. Kohl is backed by East
Germany's newly elected, pro-reunification government and by
the U.S., Britain and France in his insistence that it is
time for the four allied powers to end their official role in
Germany, allowing Germany full sovereignty.
   So far, this debate is being carried on in a gentlemanly
fashion. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze seems
to be trying to avoid locking himself into a non-negotiable
position, as well he might. The West holds the best cards,
mainly the wherewithal to help Mikhail Gorbachev stave off
what appears to be an impending national bankruptcy. Indeed,
it is quite possible that what Mr. Shevardnadze really is
angling for is an agreement from the West to pay a
substantial sum for a Soviet withdrawal. Something similar
was arranged with the Austrians when the Soviet armies
withdrew from their country 35 years ago. The Russians like
to think of it as reparations for all the trouble military
occupation has put them through. Mr. Kohl last week referred
to the Soviet position as "negotiation poker," thus
suggesting that he is no longer awed by what not long ago was
referred to as "Soviet might."
   The most likely scenario is that Mr. Gorbachev will give
in, simply because he will see that sustaining military
forces in Eastern Europe puts him in an untenable financial,
diplomatic and, possibly, military position. He, too, wants a
future in Europe and he cannot have it without Germany's
acquiescence.
   But that scenario assumes rational choices. It's not
entirely clear that what is happening in the Soviet Union is
subject to choice, rational or otherwise. As republic after
republic rises in rebellion over economic deprivation and
absence of meaningful political choice and as Russians
themselves display more and more anger, it's impossible to
know what will happen next. Can Mr. Gorbachev afford to be
seen by the Soviet military as backing down on the German
question? Is it possible he will harden his position, simply
refusing to withdraw the Soviet occupation troops? If so, how
will the West respond to that?
   In pondering such questions it is not such a bad idea to
hark back 50 years to when this still unended drama began.
Some of the assumptions made by the West then proved to be
costly indeed. One of them was that the combined armies of
France, Holland, Belgium and Britain were a match for the
German forces. On paper it looked that way. But the French
army, despite 800,000 front-line soldiers and 5.5 million
reserves, had never recovered from World War I. Its benighted
top command had somehow assumed German tanks would never come
through the rugged Ardennes, which of course is exactly what
Gen. Heinz Guderian did, pouring his panzers across the
Belgian border on May 10, 1940. The Belgians fought bravely,
but were overmatched. The French generals had assumed that
air power was a curiosity and were routed by German tanks
supported by Stuka dive bombers.
   Europe today is a very different place, of course. France,
though not an official participant in the military activities
of the NATO alliance, has a modern military establishment, a
strong economy and orderly government. West Germany has had
45 years of democracy to prepare it for the added
responsibilities it will have to shoulder when it achieves
full sovereignty. Europe, through the Common Market and other
multilateral institutions, has achieved a democratic unity
never before known in its history. Mr. Kohl fully recognizes
the importance of that unity, which is why he insists a
reunified Germany remain a part of the existing Western
alliances.
   Which raises the final question. Can the United States,
which on this battlefield won its role as the architect of a
new Europe, now call it a good job and withdraw? Many
Americans think so and the debate in Washington mainly
centers on how many U.S. troops will come home, not whether
they will. Many Europeans do not think so. Don't make
assumptions about a potent enemy, they argue. History shows,
they say, that the price of being wrong is far higher than
any "savings" that might be achieved.

   PARIS -- The French building group Bouygues S.A., its
television affiliate TF1 and the Swedish media concern
Kinnevik AB announced Friday that they have signed an accord
to cooperate in the field of television.
   The three concerns said that they signed the preliminary
cooperation accord May 9. Their first step, they said, will
be to consider a bid for the entertainment arm of Esselte AB,
which includes the pay television channel Filmnet. Esselte
put the unit up for sale about two months ago; as many as 10
different media groups from Europe and North America are
thought to be interested.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts have estimated that the unit may fetch a price as
high as $400 million.
   Beyond the Filmnet purchase, Bouygues, TF1 and Kinnevik
are expected to use the cooperation accord to generate
economies of scale, especially regarding the purchase of
programs.
   TF1 has the largest television market share in France.
Bouygues is its largest shareholder with an interest of about
25%.
   Kinnevik controls the Scandinavian channel TV3 as well as
the recently launched pay channel TV 1000.

   On a recent flight to Stockholm, a Seventh Avenue fashion
executive told me of a New York merchant who recently set up
shop on a main street in Moscow. What currency is he getting
paid in? I asked automatically. "Oh, he is confident of
working something out," he said, glibly.
   When China opened up, it was the same story. Starry-eyed
Americans made junkets there full of ideas of selling to one
billion Chinese. Then they learned about the currency
problems. Some left immediately. Others thought they could
beat those problems, and lost their investment. Still others
figured out that they could export and earn hard currency,
but then they learned about other problems.

<TEXT>
   If, despite recognizing all the hazards, one is still
intent on testing the waters in the Soviet Union or Eastern
Europe, there is a better way: the Finnish connection. The
Finns have been trading with and investing in the Soviet
Union, Hungary, Poland and the Baltic countries for decades,
perhaps centuries.
   After World War II the Finns owed the Soviets a sizable
reparation. And they paid it off, essentially by trading
goods to reduce the debt. Despite a deep-seated mistrust of
Russian intentions (based on years of outright and
semi-feudal domination by Russia), the Finns learned a lot
about doing business with the Russians. And because the Finns
always delivered on their promises, the Russians learned to
trust them and rely on their word. Until the past few years,
the Soviet Union was Finland's number one trading partner.
   While many people have traded places during Mikhail
Gorbachev's perestroika, the language, culture, business
practices and bureaucracy have not changed. And the Finns
have profited nicely from their knowledge and experience.
   Estonia is the closest Baltic republic to Finland, and the
only country outside of Finland where most people also
understand the Finnish language. Naturally, Finns have more
joint ventures in Estonia than elsewhere, including two
hotels, industrial maintenance projects, two
microcomputer-software joint ventures, and a fish processing
plant in Tallinn.
   Elsewhere in the Soviet Bloc, examples of recent Finnish
joint ventures are practically limitless. They include a
plywood project, a copper-wire joint venture, a petrochemical
project, ice crushers, ferry vessels, and the remodeling of
hotels in Leningrad and Moscow.
   Several shrewd American companies have noticed all this.
One well-known example is Combustion Engineering, which with
a unit of Neste, the giant Finnish-state oil and
petrochemicals firm, hopes to penetrate the Soviet market.
   Two lesser-known examples -- one financial, the other
industrial -- may end up becoming more typical of the
American-Finnish-Soviet "troika" arrangement.
   The parties involved in the banking and finance troika are
First Chicago, the Moscow Narodny Bank, and Finland's
Postipankki, one of the four largest banks in that country.
Postipankki's experience in Soviet ventures, even before the
troika was formed, included the first Western loan for a
venture based on Vnesheconombank's (the Soviet bank for
foreign economic affairs) risk. The expertise and financing
ability of the Finnish bank was crucial to the success of
this three-way venture.
   First Chicago brought the regional marketing strength of
its U.S. client base, including depth of experience in
financing the Midwestern grain trade with the Soviets.
Postipankki brought, in addition to its expertise in
financing Soviet joint ventures, a triple-A rating and
offices in New York, London and Moscow. Moscow Narodny is
London-based and Soviet-owned, with widespread and close
contacts throughout the U.S.S.R. And its main business is
financing East-West trade. It knows every trick in the book,
and its management keeps up with the latest innovative
financing techniques.
   The initial aim of this joint venture is to sell financing
services, primarily in support of capital-intensive projects
in Eastern Europe. Its minimum project size is $20 million to
achieve economies of scale. Typical projects use a 70-30
debt-equity structure, majority Western equity, export
credits and other government guarantees where available, and
debt-equity swaps and other mechanisms to reduce risk where
possible.
   One industrial troika has as its Finnish partner the
nation's largest construction company, Haka (part of EKA
Corp.). The U.S. partner is Transisco Industries Inc., a
relatively small San Francisco-based firm with a patented
Uni-temp heating system that can be used to retrofit rail
tank cars. These retrofitted cars are then leased along with
other special-purpose cars to customers.
   The Russian partner? There actually are two. The larger
share is owned by the Soviet Ministry of Railroads, and the
other by the Ministry of Petrochemicals. In the U.S.S.R., 80%
of all transport is by rail, which represents, in turn, 50%
of commercial rail transport world-wide. Most Soviet exports
are chemicals. Thus the link between these two ministries.
And nobody produces specialty rail cars in the U.S.S.R.
   Haka had been cooperating with the Soviet Railways since
1982 with the construction of a repair workshop for rail
cars. Haka then formed a group to concentrate on solving
problems in rail communications, which deepened its
relationship with SovRails.
   When Haka learned of Transisco and its Uni-temp
technology, the parties signed a licensing agreement in 1987,
including rights to sell to the U.S.S.R. Then they made a
contract to retrofit two prototypes for the Ministry of
Petrochemicals. Rail cars used for oil products build up
large residues, which are difficult to clean. The Uni-temp
process requires less cleaning, and results in lower costs.
By entering into this joint venture, the Soviet Ministry of
Rails showed progress on solving an important problem.
   The Transisco joint venture was registered in June 1989,
having submitted documents in March. In the meantime,
Transisco also has become involved in several East European
troika ventures with its Finnish partners. Says Marvin
Hughes, president of Transisco Trading Co. (a subsidiary of
Transisco Industries): "There's no way we would have gotten
involved in the Soviet and East Bloc ventures without using
the Finns as our partners. They can speak to and sound out
the Russians like nobody from the States can. And this isn't
the last of our ventures with the Finns in Russia or the East
Bloc, either."
   By taking advantage of the Finnish window, U.S. firms can
save a lot of time and money when trying to penetrate Soviet
and East European markets.

   Thornburgh Suffers One More Setback;
   Aide Quits After Dispute on Sentencing

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh suffered
another public embarrassment when a senior Justice Department
official resigned two weeks after he was forced to rescind
his endorsement of tougher sentencing guidelines for
corporate crime.
   The departure of Donald Ayer, the deputy attorney general,
reflects continued resentment within the Justice Department
of Mr. Thornburgh's heavy reliance on a small group of
longtime personal aides. The resignation, effective May 25,
also adds to a string of high-visibility setbacks for the
attorney general, who as a two-term governor of Pennsylvania
had been widely hailed as a savvy politician and manager.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The White House nominated William Barr, an assistant
attorney general, to succeed Mr. Ayer. The selection requires
Senate approval.
   In a statement released Friday, Mr. Ayer said he had
decided to return to his partnership in the Washington, D.C.,
office of a large Cleveland law firm, Jones, Day, Reavis &amp;
Pogue. In a letter, Mr. Thornburgh praised Mr. Ayer's
"valuable contributions" during his six months in office.
   But the bland public exchange only thinly veiled the
underlying tension over Mr. Thornburgh's management style.
Mr. Ayer is known to have been unhappy that despite his
formal designation as the attorney general's top deputy, he
was in fact outranked by a handful of Mr. Thornburgh's
personal assistants from the Harrisburg, Pa., statehouse.
   The three most prominent Thornburgh assistants -- Robert
Ross, David Runkel and Murray Dickman -- have been the
targets of persistent criticism from some current and former
Justice Department employees, who complain that the
Thornburgh team lacks the experience to lead the
75,000-person agency.
   Mr. Ayer, 41 years old, couldn't be reached for comment. A
conservative former law clerk to Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, he previously served as the Justice Department's
deputy solicitor general and as U.S. attorney in Sacramento,
Calif. Mr. Ayer's chief assistant, Peter Nowinski, also quit.
   Mr. Thornburgh instructed his senior staff not to discuss
the Ayer resignation, according to one aide. An
administration official familiar with the matter called it
"an unfortunate situation" and "just one of those things that
didn't work out."
   Specifically, the attorney general is said to have been
disappointed by Mr. Ayer's execution of several assignments
that resulted in public criticism of the Justice Department.
   Chief among these was Mr. Ayer's written endorsement in
February of tougher federal sentencing guidelines for
corporate crimes. After big business lobbyists complained to
the White House and President Bush's counsel indicated
concern, the attorney general ordered Mr. Ayer to rescind the
endorsement, pending further review. When the decision to
back off from the tougher sentencing guidelines became the
subject of politically embarrassing news reports, Thornburgh
aides blamed Mr. Ayer for acting without approval from his
boss.
   In earlier public missteps, Mr. Thornburgh saw his initial
choice for the deputy attorney general's job shot down by
Senate conservatives and his recommendation for civil rights
chief rejected by Senate liberals.
   Mr. Barr, the nominee to replace Mr. Ayer, has made a name
for himself as the author of controversial legal opinions
authorizing U.S. agents to snatch fugitives abroad without
the approval of foreign governments, and justifying the use
of U.S. military forces to conduct American law-enforcement
missions in other countries. The White House named Mr. Barr's
top assistant, Michael Luttig, to succeed him as assistant
attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel.
   Separately, the White House named Robert Bonner, a federal
trial judge in Los Angeles, to succeed John Lawn as chief of
the Drug Enforcement Administration, a branch of the Justice
Department.

   The April 2 page-one article on Eduardo "Danding"
Cojuangco Jr. ("All in the Family: Closest Marcos Crony Is
Favorite to Succeed Aquino in Philippines") ignores three
realities in today's Philippine politics: A presidential
candidate needs a nationwide party machine to win (Mr.
Cojuangco has none), the majority of the Filipino electorate
no longer can be bought and will reject anyone tainted with
the Marcos legacy, and Defense Secretary Fidel "Eddie" Ramos
is now the most popular person in the country and is running
for the presidency in 1992.
   Mr. Cojuangco will have an outside chance of winning only
if he can get himself to head a major-party ticket.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Philippines has a very high literacy rate and even in
the remotest "barrios" the people know why the country's
economy is below the level of 25 years ago: Ferdinand Marcos
and his cronies raped the country for more than two decades
and caused the peso to lose 90% of its buying power.
   Filipinos are no different from the East Europeans or
Nicaraguans who just booted out their totalitarian masters.
They will not vote for another regime headed by the very
people who stole the country's wealth and who have remained
unpunished.
   It is in the interest of the U.S. to nurture the growth of
real democracy in the Philippines instead of supporting
people like Eduardo Cojuangco who would promise continued use
of the U.S. military bases in the islands in exchange for
such support. After all, that was Ferdinand Marcos's ploy,
and look what happened.

   You anoint Mr. Cojuangco "the leading candidate" for
Philippine president, apparently excluding even President
Corazon Aquino, who many believe could quite easily be
drafted by popular demand to run again and win. In a call to
the Philippine Embassy, I learned that Mr. Cojuangco hardly
shows in the most recent polls. You fail to cite a single
poll or mention one of many Aquino allies with strong
followings, starting with Defense Secretary Ramos, Foreign
Affairs Secretary Manglapus, Speaker of the House Mitra or
Senate President Salonga.
   You realize chief opposition leader Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile
and Vice President Salvador "Doy" Laurel (in spite of his
office) lack significant electoral stature, which polls and
popular sentiment confirm. But your theme that Mr. Cojuangco
has stature flies in the face of credulity and seems based
solely on Mr. Cojuangco's Marcos crony capitalist patronage,
which your research confirms is well known, and a one-sided
exaggeration of Philippine political culture.

   So, too, America cannot afford the muddle of bureaucracy
in future science projects such as Hubble. The pictures
Hubble will send back to Earth are sure to be spectacular and
likely will rekindle voter support for space exploration, no
matter how dear the cost and how fruitless the effort. In the
long run, Hubble may turn out to be more nationalistic than
scientific.
   The European Space Agency currently maintains an orbiting
non-optical telescope that is much cheaper, more practical
and purely scientific. However, this telescope does not send
back pretty pictures, just data -- the stuff of which science
is made.

   Government, Industry Factions Poised
   For Fight Over Generic-Drug Legislation

   WASHINGTON -- A year after a congressional investigation
exposed widespread fraud in the generic drug industry,
factions in government and industry are edging toward a fight
over how best to address the problem.
   The investigation has so far led to 13 criminal
convictions of generic drug companies, industry executives
and officials of the Food and Drug Administration, on charges
ranging from racketeering to bribery. Furthermore, more than
100 generic drug products were recalled or withdrawn from the
market in the wake of the scandal, including one of the
largest-selling generic products, generic dyazide, made by
Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Springfield Gardens, N.Y.,
and Bolar Pharmaceuticals Inc., Copiague, N.Y.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now the Bush administration and Congress are preparing to
wrangle over how to punish drug companies that commit such
offenses. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), who chaired the
generic drug hearings, will submit a bill tomorrow that would
stiffen penalties against offending generic drug companies.
The administration submitted its own bill on the matter last
month.
   Both bills would require the Health and Human Services
secretary to bar individuals or companies who defraud the FDA
from submitting generic drug applications to the agency. The
bills also would impose stiff fines on companies that submit
false statements to the agency.
   But where the Bush administration would impose penalties
against any offending company subject to the FDA approval
process, Rep. Dingell will propose taking action only against
generic drug companies that do so.
   According to Dennis Fitzgibbons, a spokesman for Rep.
Dingell, generic drug companies are singled out in the bill
because far more corruption has surfaced in generic companies
than among brandname companies. Mr. Fitzgibbons said a second
reason that generic drugs were the focus was that they were
subject to an accelerated approval process. By contrast, he
said, brand-name drug companies must submit more information
to the FDA and conduct more clinical trials, so "the
potential for abuse is much smaller."
   Another reason Rep. Dingell focuses his bill on generic
companies is that he doesn't want to pick a fight with the
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represents
brand-name companies. He fears that opposition from the
powerful trade group would be a big obstacle for the bill.
   The association's general counsel, Bruce Brennan, voiced
strong opposition to the administration bill in an April 13
letter to Michael Astrue, general counsel at the HHS
Department. The association hasn't yet taken a position on
the forthcoming Dingell bill, according to a spokesman, and
"may take some time" before it does so.
   One likely opponent of restricting penalties to generic
drug companies is Rep. Henry Waxman (D. Calif.), who chairs
the congressional subcommittee where both generic drug bills
will first be considered. Rep. Waxman is a longtime advocate
of expanding the availability of lower-priced generic drugs
to the poor and elderly. In a statement, he said that while
he finds Rep. Dingell's plan to bolster FDA enforcement
useful, "there are some strong arguments for expanding the
debarment provisions to cover all drug companies and perhaps
other companies that are regulated by the agency."
   The Bush administration and Rep. Waxman are expected to
oppose a provision in Rep. Dingell's bill that would empower
inspectors general in the Health and Human Services
Department to investigate industry fraud. The inspectors
previously participated in the department's investigation of
generic drug companies, but their authority to do so was
rescinded last December by Secretary Louis Sullivan after the
Justice Department voiced opposition to their participation;
he said they should confine themselves to investigating the
government.
   William Haddad, chairman of the Generic Pharmaceutical
Industry Association, a trade group, said he thought the
inspectors general had done a "superb job" in investigating
the industry.

   WASHINGTON -- A U.S. health agency has recommended the
Pfizer drug fluconazole be used as maintenance therapy
against an AIDS-related meningitis.
   A clinical trial by the National Instititute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a unit of the National
Institutes of Health, showed that the drug is "at least as
effective and possibly superior to the standard treatment" in
preventing recurrences of cryptococcal meningitis, a
life-threatening infection of the brain and nervous system.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trial compared fluconazole with amphotericin B, the
standard treatment, to determine which drug worked better to
prevent recurrences. All patients had first been treated with
amphotericin B for the acute phase of the infection.
   Patients with immune deficiency who have suffered from
this form of meningitis require lifetime maintenance therapy
to prevent recurrences. Based on preliminary results, NIAID
said it recommends that fluconazole replace amphotericin B
for this follow-up treatment.
   Amphotericin B is a drug that must be given intravenously;
it causes fever, nausea and more serious adverse reactions,
including kidney damage and bone marrow suppression.
Fluconazole, which is taken by mouth, can cause skin rash,
nausea and rare instances of liver damage. However, it is
generally considered to be a less toxic drug, based upon the
NIAID study.
   Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services,
said, "These study results provide promising evidence of
fluconazole's efficacy and relative lack of toxicity in this
patient population. This is indeed good news."

   Peter Jennings misunderstands many of my criticisms ("ABC
Flacks for Hanoi," editorial page, April 26) and fails to
address others in his May 1 letter to the editor defending
his ABC Cambodia documentary.
   I had argued extensively that in order to understand the
conflict in Cambodia today it is essential to discuss the
colonial ambitions of the Vietnamese communists. That issue
explains why the Khmer Rouge insurgency persists with some
voluntary support, in spite of past Khmer Rouge atrocities.
It is thus crucial for any examination of American policy.
What is remarkable about Mr. Jennings's reply is that he
still manages deftly to skirt consideration of Vietnam's
critical role.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Jennings cannot understand my challenge to the
documentary's apocalyptic premise. I conclude that the Khmer
Rouge are "far from likely to seize {power} soon." He
counters with a view that ". . . the Khmer Rouge is capable
of rolling over the PRK" (the Phnom Penh regime). I do not
disagree with the statement. Yet the Khmer Rouge and the
noncommunists are fighting not only the PRK but also
Vietnamese troops and advisersa crucial fact that ABC's
documentary denied. Moreover, the Khmer Rouge are restrained
by fear of greater Vietnamese reintervention should they try
to seize power soon. That is why the Khmer Rouge are fighting
not to seize power but to pressure Phnom Penh into a
compromise political settlement.
   Mr. Jennings confuses the point that I made when I wrote
of his "extraordinary statement" that Phnom Penh's army
"alone, without the Vietnamese" has "a real problem fighting"
the resistance supported by the U.S. and China. My point was
that the Phnom Penh army is not alone "without the
Vietnamese," nor alone without the Soviet Union.
   Mr. Jennings has no idea whether the Phnom Penh leaders
are "unrepentant" Khmer Rouge, as I assert, and suspects that
I do not have proof. But one fact is compelling evidence of
"unrepentance." In spite of their frequent ritual
denunciation of Pol Pot's atrocities, Phnom Penh's leaders
have never apologized for their own role in so many of them.
These atrocities include the forced evacuation of the cities,
the murder of thousands of people identified with the former
regime, the abolition of religion and the forced dispersal of
the Cham Moslem minority communities.
   In his eagerness to put the best possible face on Phnom
Penh by asserting declining repression in Cambodia today, Mr.
Jennings misrepresents the most recent Amnesty report (March
1989). Amnesty cites little more than 400 political prisoners
of the Phnom Penh regime by name. But it does not suggest
that this amounts to anything like the total number detained.
Moreover, it notes that the 412 officially reported arrests
in Siem Reap-Utdar Meanchey province alone during the first
nine months of 1988 were greater than in previous years.
   Mr. Jennings is most incensed by what he calls my
"insidious" and "unsubstantiated" description of producer
Leslie Cockburn as a "committed left ideologue." Readers who
missed Ms. Cockburn's 1987 PBS documentary "Murder on the Rio
San Juan" (which suggested that the CIA tried to murder
Nicaraguan Contra leader Eden Pastora) should consult her
rambling tract "Out of Control," based on related work at
CBS. There Ms. Cockburn propounds the theory of a U.S.
Central America policy carried out by an "old-boy network" of
former CIA operatives, assassins and drug runners. In support
of her tale, she extensively cites Daniel Sheehan of the
Christic Institute, which sued a number of different people
who aided the Nicaraguan Contras. Mr. Sheehan's tale was
tested in a Miami court in 1988. The judge not only dismissed
Mr. Sheehan's suit, but also assessed him $1 million in legal
fees for bringing an unsubstantiated suit.
   One victim here is American Special Forces Col. Denny
Lane. Why does Mr. Jennings still insist on indicting Col.
Lane for a crime (providing American aid to the Khmer Rouge)
by insinuation and innuendo? If ABC has evidence, then why
hasn't it produced it?
   Had Mr. Jennings's ABC team been interested in a fair
examination of American policy -- which supports Cambodia's
noncommunists -- it would have discussed the fact that most
of Cambodia's noncommunist leaders and all of its soldiers
are holocaust survivors who dread the idea of a Khmer Rouge
return to power. ABC would have pondered America's failure to
provide lethal aid to such worthy recipients, instead of
falsely asserting its flow. ABC also would have discussed
Hanoi's continuing colonial intervention and political
intransigence, which have forced the reluctant and limited
alliance between the noncommunists and their former
tormentors. But such themes would have presented the struggle
for Cambodia, and American policy, as complex moral problems.
ABC's documentary could not have remained the simple tale of
American political perfidy and moral callousness -- a tale
that Mr. Jennings and Ms. Cockburn tell so easily.

   Ah, Washington. The part of it most people can see is
presumably consumed with the possibility of a grand deal on
the deficit. Out of view, more important matters are being
dealt with.
   For the first time, last year, the House placed limits on
the free mailing privileges incumbents use to bombard voters
with news of their good works. But the House isn't required
by law to abide by them; it can just pass a supplemental
appropriation months later to cover any overspending. And so
the Members will exhaust this year's $44 million franking
allowance by the end of this month. The Postal Service thinks
the House eventually will spend $80 million this year sending
out 535 million pieces of free mail explaining why voters
should send them back to Washington.

   McDonnell Douglas Warns Employees
   Its Aircraft Unit Faces Tough Times

   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. executives
are stepping up their rhetoric in a bid to turn around the
company's transport aircraft facility here.
   In a letter sent to employees last week, Chairman John
McDonnell said that unless performance radically improves,
"lenders could lose confidence in the company's ability to
cover interest payments and repay the principal." In the
first quarter, the Long Beach subsidiary posted an operating
loss of $84 million, and the corporation as a whole barely
broke even.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McDonnell said in his memo that in 1990 the company
will invest as much as $2 billion in the MD-11 commercial jet
program as it readies the three-engine craft for
certification by the Federal Aviation Administration. Coupled
with additional outlays for the troubled C-17 military cargo
plane, also built here, and several jet-fighter programs, he
indicated that the company's net cash outflow this year could
total $1.2 billion. That amount, the chairman said, must be
borrowed on top of the $2.5 billion in debt that McDonnell
Douglas had at the end of March.
   Mr. McDonnell maintained that "this higher debt level is
not necessarily a problem in itself." But he noted that "the
combination of high debt, negative cash flow and poor
performance affecting profitability does require action" that
will assuage lenders' concerns. The details of the chairman's
letter were first reported in the Orange County Register.
   The newspaper also disclosed the existence of another
document, which it described as a paraphrasing of remarks
recently made by John Capellupo, deputy president of the Long
Beach subsidiary. "The company is in big trouble," Mr.
Capellupo is quoted as saying. "If the C-17 has any more
problems; and if the MD-11 isn't certified and delivers 5-6
aircraft by the end of the year; and if the MD-80 doesn't
start producing aircraft like they are supposed to," then the
Long Beach division "could be history."
   In the wake of Lockheed Corp.'s announcement earlier this
month that it would completely pull its aircraft operations
out of Burbank, Calif., plus the memory that McDonnell
Douglas had contemplated leaving the commercial airplane
business in the early 1980s, the Capellupo comments set off
alarm bells. The Register interpreted them to mean that the
company was considering mothballing the factory here, and ran
a page-one headline that declared: "Long Beach aircraft maker
might close."
   However, McDonnell Douglas officials were quick to insist
that shuttering the plant is not even an option at this
point. "We have absolutely no plans to sell the property, no
plans to shut the doors," a spokesman at corporate
headquarters in St. Louis said.
   Doug Griffith, president of United Auto Workers local 148,
which represents nearly 20,000 McDonnell Douglas workers in
Long Beach, also asserted that there was no possibility of
closure. "That would be tantamount to the demise of the whole
corporation," he said, pointing out that McDonnell Douglas
has long set its sights on making the commercial airplane
lines here its financial backbone, thereby offsetting
slumping sales to the Pentagon.
   Nonetheless, it's clear that the pressure is mounting in
Long Beach, where 4,000 workers -- almost all white-collar --
will be laid off by the end of summer. Upper-level managers
in particular "are feeling the screws," one employee said.
   Mr. Capellupo, who along with other senior executives
declined to be interviewed, is quoted as saying: "The banks
have heard all our problems and solutions, but are about fed
up with us."
   And in his letter, Mr. McDonnell said the company has only
two undesirable alternatives besides getting planes out more
efficiently. The first would be to sell more stock to
increase equity. But that, he said, would be "very expensive
to our present shareholders because we would be issuing
shares of stock in the $40s and $50s when our net asset value
is in the $80s. That would dilute the stock that we all own."
   The second option would be to cut back commercial
transport production. That, however, "would put us even
farther behind in deliveries to our airline customers and
would quickly cause them to lose confidence in us as a
reliable supplier. That, in turn, would result in a
significant deterioration of our position in or outright
elimination from that market and could relegate us to only a
declining defense business.
   "It would," he continued, "require us to lay off up to
half" of the 50,000 workers employed at Long Beach.

   ABC's Cambodia documentary, "Peter Jennings Reporting:
From the Killing Fields" deserves some comment of its own,
insofar as it is the centerpiece of this controversy.
   It's our experience that Mr. Jennings's daily instinct is
to play the news straight. But TV journalism -- with its mix
of images, sound and facts -- is an unwieldy instrument, and
too often, large efforts, such as this documentary, go awry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Why, we wonder (not for the first time) is there so little
room for sublety in TV news? Why is it necessary for TV
journalism to dwell forever in a world of melodramas
inhabited only by the innocent and those who scheme against
the innocent?
   The ABC documentary displayed many of the techniques TV
uses repeatedly to make sure viewers Get The Message.
   The most familiar is focusing in tight close-up on the
face of one's opponent during an interrogation, as Mr.
Jennings did repeatedly with a State Department official.
From this Joe Isuzu interview, ABC's cameras cut to pictures
of desperately ill Cambodian children (with an obligatory
close-up of a fly on a little limb) who presumably would live
happily ever after except for U.S. intransigence.
   We get old footage of the Nixon administration's Cambodian
incursion, bombs cascading down, set against footage of Kent
State going up in smoke, without the least awareness that the
incursion was intended to keep the Khmer Rouge from
prevailing. Throughout, there is withering skepticism about
U.S. explanations and motives set against bland acceptance of
false Vietnamese claims to have withdrawn from Cambodia.
   In his letter to us defending the program, Mr. Jennings
asks why (except presumably to give them arms) is a U.S.
Special Forces colonel in Khmer Rouge refugee camps? Simply,
common sense will tell you, to find out what they're up to.
   This tendentious character in what purports to be
objective reporting invites suspicion of political motives.
The political stance of the program's producer is surely
relevant, and Mr. Jennings and columnist Anthony Lewis smear
Stephen Morris with their charge of McCarthyism. Yet in the
end, we think that politics is less of an explanation than
the nature of television, which to tell the news needs black
hats and white hats.

   IBM Is Expected
   To Unveil Wider
   Uses for CallPath

   NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. is
expected to unveil tomorrow a major expansion in the
capabilities of CallPath, a software product that links
telephone switches to computers, industry executives said.
   IBM will announce CallPath support for telephone switches
other than those made by Rolm, the telecommunications concern
that it owns in partnership with Siemens AG, the executives
said. It will also announce several new CallPath features,
and will outline a set of protocols for companies that write
software that works with CallPath, they added.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   IBM declined to comment, but has scheduled a "major
telecommunications announcement" for tomorrow.
   CallPath identifies callers to a telephone switch known as
a PBX, for private branch exchange, and automatically pulls
information about them from an IBM minicomputer or mainframe.
Telephone operators -- customer service representatives or
brokers, for example -- can see callers' files displayed on a
screen as soon as they pick up the phone, which saves time
and opens up new marketing opportunities.
   Currently, CallPath works only with Rolm PBXs, and only
with incoming calls. The executives said IBM will announce
CallPath support for PBXs made by Northern Telecom Inc. and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., among others. They also
said CallPath will work with outgoing calls -- a big plus for
telemarketing companies and others that depend on calling
their customers.
   AT&amp;T, Northern Telecom and Rolm together dominate the PBX
market. Since many companies keep their customer databases on
IBM computers, IBM's announcement opens up CallPath services
to a huge audience.
   In addition, the industry executives said IBM will
announce a set of standards and protocols that will enable
software writers to develop CallPath applications that work
in a large variety of environments.
   "This is going to be great news for all the different
vendors playing in this marketplace," said Dixon Doll,
chairman of DMW Group, a consulting firm in Ann Arbor, Mich.
"A very major vendor is putting a very big stake in the
ground, and everyone can take their direction from it.
Customers can now be sure that standards are going to emerge
in this market."

   Summit Health Told
   To Pay Ex-Auditor
   Total of $2.6 Million

   LOS ANGELES -- A Los Angeles Superior Court jury ordered
Summit Health Ltd. to pay a former internal auditor $2.6
million for wrongful termination.
   The auditor, Ronald Kaufman, had sued the Burbank, Calif.,
health-care company, saying he was fired in 1985 after
uncovering what he believed were financial irregularities. He
had worked there for 2 1/2 months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kaufman, who was director of internal audit, told
then-president William Pierpoint that the company was
overstating its profit and wasn't posting adequate reserves
for accounts receivable, according to the complaint. He
requested additonal employees to perform a detailed audit,
and later predicted in a deposition that the company would
need to take a charge of between $8 million and 15 million.
   Mr. Pierpoint and company management ignored Mr. Kaufman's
warnings, Mr. Kaufman's attorney Timothy Wheeler said, partly
because they were making an $80 million junk-bond offering
later that year. The next year, the company wrote down $13.2
million.
   Judd Osten, Summit's senior vice president for legal
affairs, said the 1986 write-down had nothing to do with Mr.
Kaufman's findings, but with a change in Medicare payment
procedures affecting the whole health-care industry. He said
Mr. Kaufman was fired because "his work was superficial." Mr.
Osten said the company, which had rejected a $500,000
settlement three years ago, hadn't decided whether to appeal.

   Whittle Will Add
   TV To Its Services
   For Doctors' Offices

   One-Hour Videodisk Show
   To Be by January 1991
   In 20,000 Waiting Rooms

   Whittle Communications L.P., which pioneered magazines
made especially for doctors' waiting rooms, will now put
television there.
   Whittle, the Knoxville, Tenn., media company 50% owned by
Time Warner Inc., said it will introduce Special Reports
Television to about 20,000 family doctors' offices by January
1991. The new TV system will be coupled with Whittle's
existing Special Reports magazines, which are currently found
in about 19,000 medical reception areas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While media companies are trying various new ways to
deliver traditional media, Whittle's Special Reports TV is
considered one of the most ambitious plans to target a
particular audience -- in this case, mostly women -- outside
of the home with television. Like TV networks, Whittle said
it will use A.C. Nielsen &amp; Co. to measure viewers of its new
TV program.
   Alan Greenberg, vice chairman of Whittle, said
advertisers, for a varying range of prices, will be offered
both time on the TV program and pages in Special Reports
magazines. Whittle claims that doctors are converting to the
new Special Reports TV at a rate of 80%.
   Special Reports Television will include original
programming, described by Whittle executives as "news and
entertainment for the family." The one-hour program will be
delivered to doctors' offices on videodisk and replaced every
two weeks. The videodisks will be shown via a player held in
a single oak cabinet that also holds display shelves for
Special Reports magazines.
   The new media system from Whittle comes after criticism
from some advertisers and advertising agencies that Special
Reports magazines, introduced two years ago, were overpriced
and not read by as large an audience as Whittle originally
promised. Whittle in the past has disputed that.
   Mr. Greenberg said Whittle is guaranteeing the TV system
will be in 20,000 offices and seen by 44 million people
annually, of which two-thirds will be women with children.
Should the TV system fall short of audience promises, Mr.
Greenberg said, "we'll write checks, we'll give money back"
to the advertisers.
   Under the original Special Reports, an advertiser would
have to commit to spending $2.6 million over a two-year
period. Under the new TV program, advertisers could spend as
little as $1 million during 12 month period, Mr. Greenberg
said. The original Special Reports magazines had annual
revenue of about $40 million; Special Reports Television,
it's estimated, will generate revenue of $80 million a year.

   As Colombia's Drug Terror Intensifies,
   Politicians Campaign Outside Country

   CARACAS, Venezuela -- Like presidential contenders
anywhere, Cesar Gaviria is selling himself hard.
   In one day of campaigning here, he has breakfasts with
Venezuela's foreign minister, gives a few interviews, meets a
left-wing politician, lays a wreath on the tomb of freedom
fighter Simon Bolivar, has lunch with his staff, holds talks
with voters, meets with President Carlos Andres Perez and
heads home.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And there's the hitch. Mr. Gaviria's home is neighboring
Colombia. But the political and drug-related violence there
is so bad that none of the candidates can do more than appear
on television or hold small private meetings. So Mr. Gaviria,
the candidate of the ruling Liberal Party and the
overwhelming favorite of the May 27 presidential vote, has
come to Venezuela on a three-day trip, hoping to generate
headlines and do some of the things he can't do at home.
   "It's easier to make a swing through Caracas than through
Medellin," home of one of Colombia's feared drug cartels,
says Rodrigo Pardo, an aide to Mr. Gaviria.
   Colombia is going through one of the strangest election
campaigns ever, a clandestine, cloak-and-dagger affair where
issues have taken second place to making sure the candidates
stay alive. With Colombia's drug lords calling off a
unilateral truce, violence is again sweeping the country,
despite recent successes in the government's war on drugs.
   That Mr. Gaviria is forced to campaign in the wrong
country is just another sign of the surrealism and horror of
Colombia. On Saturday, two powerful car bombs exploded in
crowded shopping centers in Bogota as Colombians shopped for
Mother's Day gifts, killing at least 15 people, including
four children, and wounding 144. A few hours later, another
car bomb went off in Cali, the other drug-cartel capital,
killing eight and wounding 37.
   The bombs, believed to be the work of drug traffickers,
marked the second-deadliest day of violence in Colombia's
10-month-old war on the drug cartels -- a war decreed by
President Virgilio Barco after presidential contender Luis
Carlos Galan was murdered in August. Since his death, two
other candidates -- left-winger Bernardo Jaramillo and Carlos
Pizarro, the head of the M-19 terrorist
group-turned-political party -- have been killed. "I don't
think any other country has had a campaign where three
candidates have died," says Mr. Gaviria. Adds law student
Luis Gomez: "If things continue this way, by the time
elections come around, we won't have any candidates left."
   Colombia, home of Latin America's stablest democratic
systems, has also become one of the world's most violent
countries. In some ways, this isn't new: Two decades of
political warfare pitting the Liberals against the
Conservatives, lasting into the 1960s, claimed an estimated
250,000 lives. But today's violence is a bewildering maze of
declared and undeclared wars that have so weakened Colombia's
democracy that even candidates say the fact elections are
taking place is a triumph.
   A particular breed of Colombian academics, known as
violentologists, is compiling grisly statistics and trying to
make sense of the bloodshed. Eduardo Pizarro, a
violentologist at Bogota's National University and the
brother of the slain M-19 candidate, counted 18,000
assassinations in 1989, of which 3% were solved, in a country
of 32 million people. Rodrigo Losada, another violentologist,
counted 23,312 homocides last year. "I think only countries
in civil war have a higher rate," he says.
   There are so many varieties of violence analysts have
trouble figuring out what it's all about. Mr. Pizarro
identifies seven violent "actors" in Colombia today: drug
traffickers, left-wing guerrillas, paramilitary squads,
peasant self-defense groups, the extreme right, organized
delinquents and urban criminals. "It's not a national
violence, but a multiregional one," he says. "In each region
there's a different threat, and the alliances shift. In some
places, it's the military and narcos against guerrillas. In
others, the guerrillas side with the narcos against the
military. The government has identified the narcos as the
biggest threat, and is promoting peace with guerrillas to
neutralize a second threat, while the extreme right develops
into a new threat."
   Not surprisingly, violence and security have dominated the
campaign, to the exclusion of all issues, including the
economy, which despite the violence is one of the healthiest
in South America. Fittingly, in a country where death is
always around the corner, it is a campaign dominated by
ghosts. Mr. Gaviria's posters show him waving in front of a
larger picture of Mr. Galan, whose mantle he took up after
Mr. Galan's assassination. And M-19's posters still show
Pizarro, who was killed on a plane on April 26, rather than
his substitute, Antonio Navarro.
   The central issue is how to deal with narco-terrorism, and
Mr. Gaviria talks tougher than the three other main
candidates, conservatives Alvaro Gomez and Rodrigo Lloreda,
who want to balance justice with Colombians' peace
aspirations, and Mr. Navarro, who encourages some form of
negotiation with drug lords.
   On his trip to Venezuela, Mr. Gaviria is permanently
followed by tens of machine-gun-toting security guards clad
in bulletproof vests and by two ambulances, including a
mobile-operating unit. Taking time out for an interview, he
outlines a position very close to that of the current
government: Keep fighting the war on drugs, and encourage
consumer countries -- principally the U.S. -- to wage war
there too and open their markets to Colombian products other
than cocaine.
   But in fighting the war on drugs, Mr. Gaviria, a
43-year-old economist who has served as both finance minister
and interior minister, says Colombia must develop other tools
besides extradition to the U.S., the main arm used by the
Barco government. He proposes a far-reaching judicial reform,
including the creation of a special court to judge drug
traffickers in Colombia, replacing judges who risk death if
they don't bow to intimidation.
   Colombians will also vote in a referendum on whether to
start the process of revising the constitution, presumably in
ways that could help the state fight the drug lords. Some
people, however, have lost hope that any change will be
enough. Mr. Pizarro, the violentologist, has attended 50
funerals, including his brother's, in three years. He has had
enough. "There are two options, he says -- "Leave the country
or live without paranoia." Since death threats prevent him
from following the second course, he has chosen the first.

   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on
$640 million of Teledyne Inc. debt in the wake of the Los
Angeles diversified manufacturer's recent spinoff of its
insurance operations.
   S&amp;P said it lowered ratings on Teledyne's senior debt to
triple-B-plus from single-A, and to triple-B from
single-A-minus on the company's subordinated debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Teledyne's financial flexibility and asset protection are
reduced since the Unitrin Inc. spinoff, the rating agency
said. The insurance operations were "conservatively
capitalized" and held valuable investments that benefited
Teledyne debt holders, the agency added.
   S&amp;P said that its revised ratings also reflect the risk of
further corporate restructuring and possible deterioration in
the company's cash-flow protection.
   Teledyne's "relatively stable earnings stream," together
with moderate capital needs, currently provide "satisfactory
cash-flow protection," but that "could erode reflecting
mediocre prospects for {the company's} defense operations and
weakness in a number of its end markets," S&amp;P said.

   Trump Is Joining Ranks of Celebrities
   Plastering Their Names on Products

   If you haven't seen enough of Donald Trump's name lately,
just wait: Coming soon are Trump desk blotters, Trump
briefcases, Trump pens and Trump wallets. And one day,
perhaps, Trump tuxedos.
   The developer, whose name already adorns an airline, three
Atlantic City, N.J., casinos and other properties, is joining
the ranks of celebrity athletes and fashion designers who
license their names to manufacturers in exchange for
royalties of between 5% and 10% of sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Donald Trump represents the entrepreneurial power in all
of us," says Robert A. Stone, vice president for licensing at
International Management Group, a New York marketing concern
that approached Mr. Trump with the idea six months ago. "Why
not come out with a line of products that represents that?"
   After turning down earlier requests and fighting some
product makers, who he claimed had misappropriated his name,
Mr. Trump says he finally agreed to market his moniker
because "it won't be time consuming" and because "what we've
put our name on has been successful." He donated proceeds
from both his best-selling book and a board game that bears
his name to charity, and says he intends to do the same with
income from the licensing effort.
   "It's a lot of money that's going to go to charity," he
says. "In that sense, I felt an obligation to do it."
   To avoid diluting the value of Mr. Trump's name, Mr. Stone
says he is negotiating only with makers of "upscale quality
merchandise," limited for now to leather goods and desk
accessories -- including pencil cups, picture frames and
blotters -- "that represent business and the Wall Street
tycoon." After the first products debut this Christmas, Mr.
Stone says, licenses may be granted to makers of tuxedos and
other apparel.
   One company anticipating a bonanza is Diplomat Pen Co. of
Stuttgard, West Germany, which plans to launch three Trump
pen brands next January. "Our early projections for year one
are in excess of $5 million," says Frank Salacuse, who heads
Diplomat's U.S. operations. Topping the line: the Trump
"Signature Collection." Only 200 of the solid gold pens will
be produced, Mr. Salacuse says: 100 fountain pen versions and
100 ball points. The price: $10,000.
   Not content to do anything in a small way, Mr. Trump also
is starting a program to license the name of his Plaza Hotel
to makers of china, crystal, wall coverings, sheets, towels,
pillow cases, furniture and "very expensive throw rugs," Mr.
Stone says.
   But there are limits, Mr. Stone insists. "We're not going
to do mugs," he says. "That's not what Donald's about."

   BRUSSELS -- Struggling to restore confidence in its
sagging stock price, N.V. Philips is expected to announce a
major management shake-up today -- one that is likely to
include the resignation of its president, Cornelis van der
Klugt.
   Spokesmen for the Dutch electronics giant said only that
Philips would make "a major announcement" this morning. But
people close to the company said they expected Mr. van der
Klugt to be replaced by Jan Timmer, a 57-year-old Philips
veteran. Mr. Timmer already had been designated to succeed
Mr. van der Klugt upon the 65-year-old president's scheduled
retirement in July 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Philips announcement, which comes in the wake of an
unexpected plunge in first-quarter profit, hopes to mute
stinging criticism of the company in recent days from
analysts and investors.
   Members of the Philips supervisory board met over the
weekend at the company's headquarters in Eindhoven, the
Netherlands, to devise a plan aimed at trying yet again to
convince the world's stock markets and the company's own
employees that Philips will finally come to grips with the
problems that have been plaguing it for most of the past
decade.
   The job of reviving Philips will now apparently be left to
Mr. Timmer, a respected and even feared manager who first
impressed the company's management as head of PolyGram,
Philips's music-recording division. He later took the helm of
the consumer electronics division, helping to revive that
business's fortunes.
   Last year, the consumer-electronics division was among the
best performers in the company in terms of its operating
income, which rose 34% to 1.1 billion guilders ($598
million). But managing the sprawling whole of Philips --
which had sales of 57 billion guilders last year under such
brand names as Magnavox and Philco -- will be a Herculean
challenge, especially at a time when Japanese competitors are
strengthening their grip on ever-larger parts of Philips's
key markets.
   The drama engulfing Philips began on May 3, when the
company reported nearly disastrous first-quarter results that
took the markets -- and, indeed, the company itself -- by
surprise. Hit by a slump in its computer business,
first-quarter profit from normal business operations
plummeted to six million guilders, from 223 million a year
earlier.
   Analysts said the results, which came just weeks after Mr.
van der Klugt had made an optimistic forecast for 1990,
showed that the company had little control over its sprawling
businesses or its financial management.
   Company officials said they were unable to predict the
sudden downturn because of the difficulty of getting quick
and accurate information from all of the company's divisions,
which are spread throughout more than 70 countries. The
company was hurt, they added, not only by a world-wide slump
in the computer business but also by unpredictable shifts in
foreign-exchange and interest rates. The first-quarter
results sent the company's stock on a downward spiral.
   Speculation late last week that the hard-nosed Mr. Timmer
would be taking control of the company has already helped to
stem the price plunge. In trading Friday, the company's stock
gained 40 Dutch cents, ending at 31.40 guilders ($17.07),
after sinking to as low as 30.40 guilders during the day.
Earlier this month, before the first-quarter results were
announced, the shares were trading near 38 guilders.

   ROME -- Italian authorites said they seized more than 90
tons of components believed to be parts for the alleged Iraqi
super gun.
   At a Saturday news conference, police said they believed
the parts, made in Italy and destined for Iraq, were for the
posterior section of a giant artillery piece. Officials said
the huge gun would be capable of firing rounds hundreds of
miles, including ones with nuclear or chemical warheads.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Italian law prohibits the sale or shipment of arms to
Iraq. Documents seized along with the components indicate
that the parts were for oil-field equipment ordered by Iraq's
Ministry of Industry.
   Carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary police, confiscated the
parts and documents Friday during raids in Terni, Naples,
Rome and Brescia, officials said.
   One of the companies involved is Societa delle Fucine
S.p.A., a steel company based in Terni in central Italy and
owned by the state-owned steel company Ilva S.p.A.. Ilva is
part of the state industrial conglomerate Istituto per la
Ricostruzione Industriale.
   A spokesman for Societa delle Fucine said, "The indication
from the Iraqi ministry was that they were for a
petrochemical plant. It did not seem possible that they could
be used for any suspicious machinery."
   Police said they haven't yet made any arrests.

Turner reported a first-quarter loss of 15 cents a share,

   Turner's revenue jumped to $290.8 million in the period
from $232 million a year earlier. Its operating profit was
flat at $52 million, reflecting the company's increased
investments in news and entertainment programming, including
the founding of an investigative-reporting unit for Cable
News Network and original dramatic programming for Turner
Network Television.
   Turner said it took a pretax charge in the period of $3
million from anticipated losses on this summer's Goodwill
Games in Seattle, bringing its total charges from the Games
to $13 million. It added that it recorded a one-time, $3
million gain in the quarter from its Atlanta Hawks basketball
team's share of expansion fees from the National Basketball
Association.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Turner's Class A shares closed at $44.375 each, up 37.5
cents.

   Prime Motor Inns Agrees to Sell 65%
   Of Two Chains to Blackstone Affiliate

<LP>
   Prime Motor Inns Inc., pressured by a soft hotel and real
estate market and a hefty debt load, agreed to sell a 65%
stake in two franchise systems to an investment partnership
for cash and notes totaling about $200 million.
   The announcement Friday -- that Prime agreed to sell a
majority stake in its Howard Johnson and Ramada franchise
systems to Blackstone Capital Partners L.P. -- inspired
another potential bidder, Prime rival Manor Care Inc., to
emerge. But although Silver Spring, Md.-based Manor Care,
which franchises Quality Inns, indicated its interest in
buying the Prime franchises, it didn't make a formal offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The accord calls for the companies to form a joint venture
to run the 490 Ramada locations and the 430 Howard Johnson
locations; Blackstone, an affiliate of Blackstone Group, an
investment banking boutique, would manage the venture. Prime
Chairman Peter E. Simon said the arrangement would enable
Prime to "maintain a significant stake in the future earnings
potential" of the franchises and allow Prime to focus on
growth in specific market niches: economy and limited-service
hotels.
   Fairfield, N.J.-based Prime, one of the largest U.S. hotel
companies, will retain its AmeriSuites and Wellesley Inns
chains and the Rodeway Inns franchise system. There are about
1,100 properties with 150,000 rooms in all its chains,
including Howard Johnson and Ramada.
   Mr. Simon also said the accord "underscores" Prime's
long-term strategy "to streamline and strengthen" its balance
sheet. Prime recently reported a 98% plunge in profit -- to
$209,000, or one cent a share -- for the third quarter ended
March 31.
   Prime's stock has been hammered in recent weeks by what
analysts call Wall Street's loss of confidence in Prime's
ability to expand its business in the current market. The
stock, which traded as high as $23.75 in January, closed
Friday at $10.375, up 37.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
   Late last month, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed Prime's
double-B-plus subordinated debt on its CreditWatch list for
possible downgrade, affecting about $230 million in long-term
debt.
   The rating concern said Friday that the transaction would
help to "significantly reduce" Prime's bank debt and improve
liquidity short term. But S&amp;P is keeping Prime on CreditWatch
because, it said, Prime would be "parting with the bulk of a
stable source of revenues from the franchise system while
increasing reliance" on lesser-known businesses.
   Aside from the $140 million in cash and about $60 million
in notes an alliance with Blackstone would bring, Prime might
benefit in other ways from teaming up with the investment
firm. Blackstone's management team will include Henry R.
Silverman, the firm's general partner and former chairman and
chief executive officer of Days Inns of America Inc. "The
team that Mr. Silverman assembled at Days Inns is understood
to be the most successful" at franchising, said Joseph P.
Gaynor III, senior vice president of corporate finance at
Prime.
   While Mr. Silverman acknowledged that the hotel market is
overbuilt, he said he plans to actively recruit independent
hotel owners to link up with the franchise system.
   The Howard Johnson and Ramada franchise system will grow
"much faster and will be much more valuable" under Mr.
Silverman's management, said Michael Mueller, an analyst with
Montgomery Securities, San Francisco, who recently changed
his recommendation on Prime to a buy from a hold.
   Mr. Mueller said the agreement "eliminates liquidity
concerns" about Prime. Mr. Gaynor said Prime has paid down
about $40 million on the about $320 million of bank debt
Prime has coming due next year. He said that Prime would use
proceeds from the Blackstone accord to pay half the remaining
$280 million and that Prime's goal is to pay the bank debt by
the end of this year through some financing and some asset
sales.
   Prime's expansion last year came during a time when
financing for such projects were increasingly scarce and the
real estate industry was softening.
   Last year, Prime loaned FCD Hospitality Inc. money so FCD
could purchase Servico, an operator of 45 hotels, from the
Southmark Corp. Today Prime has received only a nominal
payment on the loan and is still owed roughly $200 million,
Mr. Gaynor said.
   Also last year, Prime took on even more debt to buy the
Ramada's U.S. franchise operation. Meanwhile the company has
a more than $200 million construction program underway to
develop roughly 25 new properties by end of 1990.
   Mr. Mueller noted that Days Inns President Michael Levin
resigned recently, and he speculated that Mr. Levin might
join Blackstone's management team. Mr. Silverman said it was
too early to speculate about management. Blackstone's accord
is subject to financing and regulatory approval.

   DENVER -- Consolidated Oil &amp; Gas Inc. said a U.S.
bankruptcy court approved its plan to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings.
   The plan calls for all of the company's oil and gas
properties to be sold for $24.2 million to a new entity owned
by institutional investment partnerships under management of
First Reserve Corp. of Greenwich, Conn.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Proceeds from that sale will be used to repay a $27
million loan from Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, Consolidated
said.
   Meanwhile, assets valued by Consolidated at about $8
million -- including $1.5 million in cash and 880,306 shares
of common stock of Columbus Energy Corp., Denver -- will be
liquidated and distributed to satisfy subordinated debt
totaling about $28 million and to shareholders. The company
said shareholders will receive 10% of any cash recovered in
excess of $7 million.
   First Reserve said it intends to retain George Simmons,
president and chief operating officer of Consolidated, to
head the new company, which will keep the old name and remain
based in Denver.
   Consolidated filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court
protection in March of last year, giving it protection from
creditors while it worked out a plan to pay its debts.

   TORONTO -- Horsham Corp. said its president and chief
operating officer, Jeremy Garbutt, has been named to the
additional positions of president and chief operating officer
of 60%-owned Clark Oil &amp; Refining Corp., St. Louis.
   Horsham, a Toronto investment concern, said the
appointment followed the resignation from Clark Oil of its
chairman and chief executive officer, Ralph Cunningham, who
will leave Aug. 31 to become president of Texaco Chemical
Co., a division of Texaco Inc.
</LP>

   Mr. Garbutt said Clark Oil will seek a replacement for Mr.
Cunningham, but the exact title of the new position hasn't
been decided. In the meantime, Mr. Garbutt said he plans to
spend at least the next six months in St. Louis getting to
know the Clark Oil business and providing for a smooth
management changeover.
   Mr. Garbutt moved to Horsham last month from mining
company affiliate, American Barrick Resources Corp., where he
was chief financial officer. Since then, Horsham has said
that it intends to take a more active role in running Clark
Oil and that it will exercise an option to increase its stake
in the subsidiary to 75% later this year.
   Mr. Garbutt said he would have preferred Mr. Cunningham to
have remained at Clark Oil. "He got head-hunted away," a
Horsham spokeswoman said.

   GM's Plan to Boost Executives' Pensions
   Draws Fire; One Big Holder Is to Vote `No'

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp.'s plan to almost double
the pensions of departing chairman Roger B. Smith and other
top executives is drawing fire from some big shareholders,
with at least one vowing to vote no on the proposal.
   Michigan's state treasurer, Robert Bowman, usually a
supporter of GM management, said Saturday he will vote the
state's 8.8 million GM shares against the plan, which would
increase Mr. Smith's annual retirement pay to $1.2 million.
Mr. Smith is scheduled to retire Aug. 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We don't think this is the best use of $42 million," Mr.
Bowman said, referring to the estimated $41.6 million total
cost of the pension increases for 3,350 senior GM executives,
including Mr. Smith.
   A GM spokesman said yesterday it wouldn't be appropriate
to comment on Mr. Bowman's voting plans. "Shareholder voting
is up to each individual," he said.
   Mr. Bowman's decision, however, hardly dooms the pension
proposal. Michigan is one of the three biggest GM holders,
but it casts only 1.5% of the total 602 million-share common
stock vote.
   Further, the company's argument that its executive
pensions rank in the bottom 21% of major industrial companies
is winning support from other big shareholders.
   "At a time when the insurance industry is teetering on
junk bonds and the banking system is in disarray. . . . here
is a company that's piled up $10 billion in cash and is a
financial powerhouse," said an official with one large
institutional GM stockholder. This official, who requested
anonymity, added: "If they want to give themselves better
pensions, they probably deserve it."
   GM also got a boost from Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc., a consulting firm that advises many large
institutional investors on how to vote on proxy issues. The
proposal "would serve the purpose of bringing General Motors'
pension benefits up to a par with those of its competitors,"
said Andrew Smith, a senior analyst with the firm, in a
statement Friday.
   Still, the executive pension issue is shaping up to be an
unusually divisive one as GM prepares for its annual
shareholders meeting on May 25. In recent years, GM's
management has had strong support from institutional
investors, who like the company's hefty $3-a-share dividend.
   But several major fund managers said late last week that
they may break with management over the size and timing of
the proposed executive pension increases.
   "We're a little surprised and concerned," said Richard
Koppes, general counsel for the California state retirement
system. Although state pension officials haven't officially
decided how to cast their proxy ballots, "we're leaning
toward voting against it," he said. Earlier this year,
California officials wrote an unusual letter to GM directors
expressing concern about GM's loss of market share in the
U.S.
   Roland MacHold, the director of New Jersey's state pension
fund, called the proposed pension increases "ill-timed."
While Mr. MacHold said he isn't sure how his fund will vote,
he added: "I'm disappointed they'd do this just in advance of
intense labor negotiations {this fall}."
   The company's proposal has infuriated leaders of the
United Auto Workers union. That's because the proposal
undermined the union leadership's effort to blunt a
rank-and-file drive to make cost-of-living raises for
blue-collar pensioners a top demand in bargaining with the
Big Three auto makers this fall. Union leaders share the view
of company officials that putting UAW pensions on a
cost-of-living escalator would cost billions, hurt Detroit's
competitiveness, and deplete resources that might otherwise
go to higher wages and improved job protections.
   Another controversial aspect of the timing is that the
increases are retroactive to Nov. 1, 1989. GM contends it
needs sweeter executive pensions "to improve competitiveness"
and attract top managerial talent. But critics contend that
boosting the pay of those already retired, or about to, won't
contribute to that goal.
   The fact that the oft-controversial Mr. Smith will be one
of the first beneficiaries also is spurring some criticism.
"I don't think Roger Smith is employable anywhere except the
movies," snapped Mr. MacHold, alluding to a recent movie that
posed Mr. Smith as the villain behind the decline of Flint,
Mich.
   The new pension formula outlined in GM's proxy statement
is more lucrative because it includes executive bonuses in
calculating the retirement benefit. Previously, GM pensions
were based solely on salary. But straight salary can be less
than 50% of a GM executive's total direct compensation.
   GM's board could proceed with its plan even in the
unlikely event that a majority of shareholders vote against
it. But the company has assured shareholders that it will
abide by their wishes.
   "I give GM credit for putting it before the shareholders
before the labor negotiations," Mr. Bowman said. Otherwise,
he added, "it would have looked like they were trying to
hoodwink people."

   Law -- Washington Docket:
   Courts and Congress Close to Agreement
   On Cutting Delays, Costs of Civil Cases

   WASHINGTON -- After locking horns for months, the federal
judiciary and congressional leaders may be nearing an uneasy
agreement on legislation aimed at reducing delay and expense
in civil cases.
   Aides to Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, have been negotiating with
officials of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
over a compromise version of legislation Sen. Biden
introduced in January.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The negotiations may not be quite as delicate as current
efforts to initiate a budget summit, but it's close; federal
judges are very sensitive about attempts to tell them how to
manage their courts.
   "We are in agreement on the general fundamental principles
to reduce cost and delay. But it's micro-regulation by
statute and mandatory requirements that concern us," says
Chief Judge Robert Peckham of the federal district court in
San Francisco, who is leading the judiciary's response to
Sen. Biden.
   As first proposed, Sen. Biden's legislation would have
required each federal district court to appoint a local
advisory committee and to adopt a civil-case management plan
within one year. The plans were to include a procedure for
placing cases on different tracks, with simple cases to be
handled quickly, and complex cases more slowly. And judges
would have been given 45 days after the time defendants
respond to a lawsuit to set a detailed schedule for pretrial
discovery, motions and the trial date.
   The proposal, which was produced by a task force that
studied the problems of delay and litigation cost, also would
have required each court to publish periodic lists of cases
that fall behind schedule.
   In introducing the legislation, Sen. Biden said, "The
civil justice system as we know it today is not fulfilling
its basic objectives of providing the just, speedy and
inexpensive resolution of disputes." The bill had support
from Democratic and Republican leaders on the Senate and
House Judiciary Committees.
   But it wasn't long before federal judges were protesting
the intrusion into their courtrooms that the legislation
would represent. "Many thoughtful federal judges are very,
very uneasy about the signals this bill sends of legislative
incursion -- albeit well-meaning -- in the judicial arena and
what it portends for the future," said Chief Judge Aubrey
Robinson of the federal court in Washington, in Senate
Judiciary Committee testimony in March.
   While they were complaining, however, the judges didn't
miss the message behind the legislation. On May 1, the
Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the federal
courts, adopted its own 14-point program, requiring each
district court to appoint an advisory group to recommend a
case-management plan. But the Judicial Conference system
gives judges discretion to adopt only those recommendations
that are "feasible and constructive" and says nothing about
tracking or listing delayed cases.
   The 27-judge Judicial Conference recommended that two
model plans be developed for handling civil cases with less
delay and expense, and that the plans be tested in five
volunteer district courts.
   Now the drama has moved into a third act: negotiations
between aides to Mr. Biden and officials of the
Administrative Office aimed at producing a bill that the
judiciary can, at the very least, refrain from opposing, if
not actually supporting.
   Final details of the compromise are still being drafted
and haven't been approved by a working group led by Judge
Peckham. But its features will be far less mandatory,
according to those familiar with the discussions. They
include giving districts three years, instead of one, to
develop a plan, using the tracking system initially only as a
pilot program in a few districts, and setting guidelines and
principles that courts may adopt for civil-case management,
rather than mandatory rules. District courts that move
quickly would receive as an incentive extra funds to
implement their plans.
   Sen. Biden, aides say, hopes to settle on a compromise and
to move it quickly through Congress this year. But, says
Judge Peckham, "It is difficult to say for certain that we
will reach an accomodation."

   TORONTO -- Campeau Corp. said a major secured creditor,
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., agreed that, until June 30, it
won't call its $480 million loan to the financially strained
real estate and retailing concern without first giving nine
days' notice.
   The previous agreement to give Campeau a nine-day warning
before acting on DeBartolo's security against the loan
expired May 10. A similar agreement with the Reichmann
family's Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. doesn't have an
expiry date.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In January, Campeau defaulted on the DeBartolo loan and
$225 million remaining in a loan from Olympia &amp; York when its
U.S. retailing units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp., sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
In March, Campeau refused to pay interest due on the loans.
   DeBartolo's loan is secured mainly against 83.8% of the
stock in Ralphs Grocery Co., Campeau's southern California
supermarket chain, which isn't in Chapter 11 proceedings.
DeBartolo, a closely held real estate developer based in
Youngstown, Ohio, lent Campeau $480 million as part of the
equity contribution toward Campeau's $6.6 billion takeover of
Federated in May 1988. The Olympia &amp; York loan, made last
September to help Federated and Allied meet their fall
working capital needs, is secured mostly by some of Campeau's
Canadian real estate assets. Campeau plans to sell much of
its real estate under a financial restructuring of its
Canadian operations.

   Amax's $1.25 Billion Offer for Peabody
   Topped by Hanson; Bids' War Is Doubted

   NEW YORK -- Amax Inc. made a $1.25 billion bid for Peabody
Holding Co., the largest U.S. coal producer, but the offer
was immediately topped by Hanson PLC, which said it was
"determined" to complete its previously announced plans to
buy Peabody.
   Wall Street observers said that Hanson's quick response
suggested that Amax, a natural-resources company based here,
had misplayed the bid and succeeded only in drawing attention
to its own vulnerability as a possible takeover candidate.
The observers said they doubted that Amax would make a new
bid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hanson acquired 45% of Peabody last month for $504 million
from three other companies. In March, Hanson had announced a
plan to buy the remaining 55% of Peabody for $715 million
from Newmont Mining Corp. Hanson acquired a 49% stake in
Newmont by buying Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd. last August.
   Hanson's agreement with Newmont allows other bidders to
top its offer for all of Peabody before the purchase is
completed in June, to make sure Newmont's public holders
receive a fair price. The Amax bid, which occurred around
noon Friday, valued Newmont's Peabody stake at $718.5 million
-- only a slight increase on Hanson's offer. Within two
hours, Hanson boosted its bid to $725.6 million.
   An Amax spokesman wouldn't comment on whether Amax plans a
new bid. Wall Street observers said they doubted Amax would
engage in a bidding war with the much larger Hanson, a
British conglomerate with $9 billion in cash and interests in
tobacco, specialty chemicals, and building products,
particularly in view of Hanson's stated determination.
"Hanson wants this company," said one individual close to
Hanson.
   But the sequence of events puzzled some observers. Said
one: "The question is why would Amax openly compete with
Hanson, and risk putting themselves in play {for a takeover},
with a bid that was such a small increase over Hanson's
offer?"
   An Amax spokesman suggested Amax may have misunderstood
Newmont's March 29 announcement of the Peabody sale to
Hanson, which stated that Hanson and Newmont "would accept"
an offer above $1.24 billion for all of Peabody. "Reading
that, it looks like they're inviting an offer and naming a
price," the spokesman said. "Well, we took them at their word
and now we see their response."
   Vahid Fahti, a base-metals analyst at Prescott Ball &amp;
Turben Inc. in Cleveland, said that some people might
interpret the Amax bid "as a defensive move." Amax has been
the subject of off-and-on takeover speculation in the past
six months, with unusually high trading volume in its stock.
   News of the Peabody bid hurt Amax's stock price, which
declined 12.5 cents a share to $25.25 Friday in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange despite a strong
advance in the overall market. Some analysts value the
company's parts as high as $50 a share.
   In 1989, Amax reported profit of $360.4 million, or $4.19
a share, on revenue of $3.89 billion. Aluminum accounted for
65% of its sales, coal 14%, gold 10%, with the remainder in
molybdenum and natural gas. It has slightly less than $1
billion in debt. Its Amax Coal unit is the third-largest U.S.
producer, with 4% of the market compared with 9% for Peabody.
   Mr. Fahti said he expects Amax's earnings to decline about
35% this year to $2.75 a share, mainly due to lower aluminum
prices and softer demand in the housing and construction
markets, the end-users of much of Amax's output. He said a
coal acquisition that more than doubled Amax's debt could
make the company "somewhat less attractive to a suitor."
   The Amax bid amounts to about 12 times Peabody's 1989
profit of $101.9 million on revenue of $1.74 billion.
Although Hanson doesn't have any other coal business, it has
operations in several mining industries, including cement,
gold, sand and gravel, and brick.
   Last August, Amax made a $2.3 billion bid for Falconbridge
Ltd., a Canadian nickel, copper and zinc producer, but was
later outbid by Noranda Inc. and Trelleborg AB, two other
metals concerns. The Amax spokesman said Amax had been
invited to bid by Falconbridge, which was concerned about a
"creeping takeover" by Noranda, which had acquired 28% of
Falconbridge.
   One company with a rumored interest in Amax is Peter
Kiewit Sons Inc., a closely held concern in Omaha, Neb., with
interests in construction and natural resources. A spokesman
for Kiewit couldn't be reached for comment.

   The Trump Shuttle has lost at least $85 million since
Donald Trump bought it last June, which suggests that it will
be difficult for the real estate mogul to sell the airline at
a profit, or even to break even.
   The Shuttle's fiscal results, obtained by this newspaper
and confirmed by people familiar with Trump Shuttle
operations, show that the airline eked out an operating
profit over the past few months, after six months of
operating losses following its acquisition. But after debt
service, amortization and other factors, the operation was
still showing a net loss of more than $150,000 a day as of
last month. The losses may mean that Mr. Trump could have
difficulty breaking even on a sale of the airline, which he
purchased from Eastern Airlines for $365 million last year
and which he announced was up for sale last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Trump has said he expects the Shuttle to sell for as
much as $600 million, but some analysts have said the asset
is not worth more than $400 million. Given his losses, Mr.
Trump would have a substantial loss on the sale, if the lower
estimate is accurate. Mr. Trump has said there are numerous
suitors, including America West Airlines. One new potential
buyer is former Pan Am chairman C. Edward Acker; people
familiar with the situation said Mr. Acker is negotiating to
purchase the airline for between $450 and $475 million. Mr.
Acker couldn't be reached for comment.
   A possible sale of the Shuttle is part of a larger
strategy by Mr. Trump to raise cash for future purchases. Mr.
Trump is also refinancing many of his real estate holdings,
and has discussed selling certain casino assets. Such actions
have led to speculation that Mr. Trump needs to raise cash to
offset his debt load. Mr. Trump has vehemently denied he has
cash flow shortage.
   The Northeast corridor shuttle once was considered one of
the premier franchises in the airline industry. In its last
five years of operation, Eastern earned an annual average net
income of just under $19 million, though the company did not
have to carry the debt load Mr. Trump does. The shuttle route
is also profitable for Mr. Trump's competitor, Pan Am Corp.
(That airline does not break down its Shuttle figures,
however.) When Mr. Trump purchased the shuttle from Eastern,
the parent was operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection and in the midst of a strike, and its market share
had slipped to 17%.
   Since the purchase, the Trump Shuttle has shown some
improvement; the airline had a $12 million operating loss for
the period between last June's start-up and year end. In this
year's first quarter, it had an operating profit more than $1
million. And last month, it earned over $2 million from
operations. Still, it has yet to post a net profit. It had a
net loss of $5 million in April, a $20 million loss in the
first quarter and a $60 million loss last year.
   The net loss figures include debt service, non-cash
charges and a management fee paid to Mr. Trump. People
familiar with the operation stressed that the noncash charges
were only paper losses, because they included depreciation of
assets that may not lose value.
   Mr. Trump has said most of the losses reflect the start-up
costs of getting the Shuttle in gear after it lost market
share during the Eastern strike, and capital improvements.
And people familiar with the situation, pointing to the
improving results, say that April's figures show that the
Shuttle has turned the corner.
   But the fiscal results do not take into account any
personal debt taken on by Mr. Trump to finance the
acquisition. Mr. Trump is believed to have made virtually the
entire acquisition with borrowed funds -- including not only
the $365 million purchase price but $35 million to refurbish
airplanes.
   According to the documents, the Shuttle has a $245 million
mortgage. Mr. Trump is believed to have borrowed an
additional $155 million. Therefore, although the shuttle is
paying debt service of the $245 million loan, the additional
debt isn't included in the corporate documents.
   The Trump Shuttle's heavy losses are a reflection of Mr.
Trump's inability to pick up as much business from Pan Am as
he originally predicted he would. He currently commands about
half of the passenger market share. That figure is way up
from the 17% share he inherited from strike-torn Eastern, but
far short of the 60% he said he expected to have by this
date, and short of Eastern's peak of 53% market share.
   Mr. Trump has been hit with higher fuel costs and a
recession in the Boston market that has cut into ridership.
Moreover, his heavy spending efforts to refurbish planes and
offer luxury service have been lost on business travelers
more concerned with schedules than glitz, travel agents said.
   The losses may also show that for all his name appeal,
even Mr. Trump may not be able to overcome the harsh economic
realities of the deregulated airline industry. Because of
economies of scale, larger airlines, including rival Pan Am,
can pay less for marketing, maintenance and computer
reservation systems than a relatively small operation such as
the Trump Shuttle.
   People familiar with the situation said that certain
clauses in his pact with Eastern prevent him from selling the
shuttle to six major carriers for six years. But they said
that because Eastern, still in Chapter 11, needs cash, the
company's creditors probably would waive that restriction for
a fee.

   Marketers Spy and Entice to Get an Edge

   PHILADELPHIA -- In the back of a gray Dodge minivan,
Joseph Karatka sits in a swivel seat gathering intelligence.
Pointing a transmitter into the air, he listens and waits. A
computer screen starts flashing tangerine-colored graphics,
which he quickly deciphers.
   "The competition has turned on their extra spectrum," Mr.
Karatka exclaims. "That wasn't there last week."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Karatka pilots the snoop van for Bell Atlantic Corp.'s
Mobile Systems unit. In the high-tech vehicle, equipped with
three antennae, two powerful computers, three cellular
telephones, a facsimile machine and a printer, his daily
mission is to find out how archrival Metrophone's cellular
system compares with Bell Atlantic's.
   "Once, I drove down the Pennsylvania Turnpike measuring
their service quality against ours," says Mr. Karatka. "It
took me the entire day. But we got a lot of good
information."
   Competition for cellular phone service has become so
intense that companies are resorting to more clandestine
tactics and bolder marketing ploys to keep an edge. Some
cellular companies dispatch spies to check on rivals'
merchandise and promotions. All enlist department stores,
electronics retailers and auto supply shops to sell their
cellular phone service along with their equipment. In return,
they offer commissions of $200 to $300 for each customer
contract, up from only about $50 a few years ago.
   The stakes are high for dominance in the cellular market.
Last year, Americans spent nearly $2 billion on cellular
calls. This year, revenue will reach $3.2 billion. Some
locations, such as Los Angeles and New York, are straining to
accommodate the current volume of calls, but with digital
technology facilitating the industry's growth, revenue could
reach $15 billion by 1995, experts say.
   Cellular phone usage is soaring even though basic rates
aren't dropping. Since cellular phone service was first
offered in 1984, the number of mobile phone customers in the
U.S. has surged to 3.5 million. Yet the cost of a cellular
call during peak hours hasn't varied much from current rates
of about 37 cents to 50 cents a minute. (For the average
subscriber, that translates into a monthly bill of about
$100.) By 1998, the number of cellular subscribers will grow
more than sevenfold to 26 million, according to Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   "Growth is phenomenal," says Michael E. Kalgoris, chief
executive officer of Metrophone, a joint venture of McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc. and Metromedia Inc. "That's why
it's so fiercely competitive."
   In their ads, cellular companies make much of their
technological capabilities.
   Nynex Corp.'s Mobile Communications unit boasts that it
has "25% more calling channels than anybody else," making
customers less likely to wait for a line. McCaw promotes its
sophisticated integrated network, which "hands off calls
seamlessly from one cell to the next" and prevents customers
from being dropped in the middle of a call.
   But because they sell essentially similar equipment and
service, cellular companies also are trying to stand out from
one another by dishing up distinctive enticements. Mr.
Kalgoris, for instance, says Metrophone offers customers free
long-distance calling on weekends. Nynex Mobile
Communications is offering free "voice mail" -- a phone
message service -- through the end of May. Until recently,
Chicago-based Ameritech gave away cellular telephones to any
customer who signed a one-year service contract.
   Other companies offer more exotic enticements. Advanced
Telecomm Inc. in Pittsburgh is offering customers two
round-trip tickets to Hawaii, Tahiti or the Bahamas if they
buy a cellular telephone from the company and subscribe to
its cellular service for a year. Vince lo Castro, Advanced
Telecomm's chief executive officer, says the promotion, which
was launched in Philadelphia last month and Washington and
Pittsburgh this month, has nearly doubled sales in some
markets. Even one Bell Atlantic manager admits: "I found
myself considering {the offer} before I came back to my
senses."
   One of the biggest battles among cellular phone companies
is over signing up stores as exclusive distribution agents.
With offers of hefty commissions or advertising and
promotional support, they recruit such chains as Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co. and R.H. Macy &amp; Co. to hawk their cellular
phone service to customers who buy cellular phones.
   As an exclusive distribution agent, a retailer receives a
flat commission on every cellular telephone contract sold,
whether it's for 60 days or 39 months. In Chicago, for
instance, Sears salespeople encourage cellular telephone
buyers to sign a service contract with Ameritech Mobile
Communications.
   Retailers often use the commissions to offer deep
discounts on phones. Tops Appliance City, a big retailer in
New Jersey, last month was offering an astoundingly
low-priced portable cellular phone. With a 90-day cellular
contract through Bell Atlantic, a customer could buy the
phone for $67. Tops sold the phone only with the Bell
Atlantic service, but the same set without a contract can
cost $300 to $500 at other stores.
   This marketing practice, known as bundling, has landed
some companies in trouble. Law enforcement agents and
regulators in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas, Colorado and
California are looking into the practice. Some regulators now
require cellular companies to state clearly that advertised
discount prices on phone equipment are available only when
consumers enter into a binding service contract. Last month
seven cellular-phone retailers were accused by the Michigan
attorney general's office of using misleading advertisements
in the sale of phone equipment. The companies have agreed to
change their advertising practices.
   "We are particularly concerned about ads for new
technological services {such as cellular phones}, because
consumers may not fully understand the potentially related
costs," says Pennsylvania's attorney general, Ernie Preate
Jr.
   The cellular battle could get even nastier if Federal
Digital Cellular has its way. The Washington, D.C., company
is asking regulators to open up the duopoly structure
originally established by the Federal Communications
Commission to a third cellular phone competitor in each major
market.
   Meanwhile, cellular deregulation is spreading, opening the
way for possible price cuts. California regulators recently
proposed a plan that would allow mobile phone service
companies to adjust rates by as much as 10% without
regulatory permission. About 20 states have stopped setting
rates for cellular companies.
   Despite all the ad promotions, cutthroat enticements and
regulatory scrutiny, Craig McCaw, chairman and chief
executive officer of McCaw, says the cellular marketing
battle is just heating up. "The cellular industry has been so
busy building itself," he says, "that it hasn't engaged in
real marketing yet."

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Boesky May Take Center Stage
   In Mulheren Insider-Trader Trial

   At the trial of John A. Mulheren Jr., scheduled to begin
today, the 40-year-old arbitrager may have to yield center
stage to Ivan F. Boesky.
   The convicted former stock speculator is slated to make
his debut as a government witness in the case against Mr.
Mulheren. Mr. Mulheren was charged in a 42-count indictment
last year based largely on information provided to the
government by Mr. Boesky, who has completed a three-year
prison term for insider-trading-related crimes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In June, a federal grand jury in Manhattan, N.Y., charged
Mr. Mulheren with manipulating the price of Gulf &amp; Western
Inc. shares and with "parking" stock for Mr. Boesky. Parking
occurs when an investor sells securities with the
understanding that they will be repurchased, usually at a
prearranged time and price.
   The government alleged that Mr. Mulheren used the tactic
to conceal the true ownership of the parked securities and to
help Mr. Boesky evade taxes and defeat minimum net capital
requirements for broker-dealers. Leonard DeStefano, a former
trader for Jamie Securities Co., Mr. Mulheren's defunct
securities firm, is charged with two counts of conspiracy and
fraud. Both have pleaded innocent.
   Mr. Boesky is expected to testify before a packed
courtroom as early as this week. But interest in his
testimony has waned somewhat since former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. junk-bond wizard Michael Milken pleaded guilty
to six felony counts and agreed to pay $650 million in fines
and restitution. Mr. Boesky's cooperation led to the
government's cases against Mr. Milken and Drexel.
   The government is also likely to call Martin Davis, the
chairman of Gulf &amp; Western and its successor company,
Paramount Communications Inc. as a witness.
   Thomas Puccio, the New York lawyer representing Mr.
Mulheren, is expected to try to prove that Mr. Boesky is
biased in favor of the government because Mr. Boesky's 1986
settlement left him with many millions of dollars.
   Mr. Puccio successfully prosecuted U.S. congressmen in the
noted Abscam bribery case. His clients have included
socialite Claus Von Bulow and former Bronx, N.Y., Borough
President Stanley Friedman. Mr. DeStefano, 34, is represented
by Thomas Fitzpatrick, a colorful New York lawyer with a wry
sense of humor.
   Prosecutors in the case are E. Scott Gilbert and Alfred
Pavlis, neither of whom has ever tried a major
securities-fraud case. The two will be assisted by more
experienced prosecutors during the trial. U.S. District Judge
Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, appointed to the federal bench in
1986, will preside over the trial, which is expected to last
a month.
   Mr. Mulheren gained widespread publicity in February 1988
when he set out from his Rumson, N.J., home in army fatigues
with a loaded rifle. He told his wife he was going to shoot
Mr. Boesky. Mr. Mulheren is on probation in connection with
that matter.
   A self-confessed manic-depressive who takes lithium to
control his problem, Mr. Mulheren is well liked by many on
Wall Street and counts rock star Bruce Springsteen among his
close friends. Last week Mr. Mulheren, who is 6 feet 2 inches
tall, showed up in court in his typical fashion, with
stylishly long hair, wearing a purple polo shirt, chinos and
brown moccasins without socks.

   JURORS CAN BE IMPARTIAL even if exposed to pre-trial
publicity.
   The nation's leading experts on the jury system, including
federal judges, lawyers and social-science researchers,
expressed wide agreement that a defendant can get a fair
trial from jurors who have read or viewed news reports of the
case prior to trial. The experts discussed the issue Friday
at a forum sponsored by the Annenberg Washington Program of
Northwestern University.
   The panelists cited research, as well as personal trial
experience, that indicated jurors aren't as strongly
influenced by publicity as some suspect -- and that most
jurors can decide a case based on the evidence despite
preliminary impressions developed from news reports.
   The issue has been hotly debated in recent months. Some
judges routinely exclude from juries people who know anything
at all about the matter. In heavily publicized cases, such as
the Iran-contra trial of Oliver North, this means seating a
jury of people who have paid no attention to newspapers or
television and have little interest in public affairs. Such a
course, argued the Annenberg program's director, lawyer
Newton Minow, doesn't serve the interests of justice.
   Selection of ill-informed jurors, added Los Angeles lawyer
Ronald Olson, reduces the likelihood of rational argument at
trial and opens the door to emotional appeals.
   In cases in which judges have refused to exclude jurors
who were exposed to pretrial publicity, studies show that the
jurors have quickly forgotten, or discounted, what they saw
on television and concentrated on the testimony at the trial
itself, panelists said.
   "Jurors who serve should file a class-action suit against
judges and lawyers and insurance companies on the basis of
slander and libel," said panelist Neil Vidmar, a professor
and jury researcher at Duke Law School, who maintained that
juries are given too little credit for the quality of their
decision-making.
   The panelists specifically predicted that former
Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega and Washington, D.C., Mayor
Marion Barry, both facing drug-related charges in highly
publicized cases, will be able to get fair trials.
   The key, the panelists said, is finding jurors who can
keep open minds. The panelists said it is up to judges in
particular to question potential jurors carefully to root out
those whose minds are already made up. In addition, the
panelists said, judges must do a better job of instructing
jurors on how the process works and what their
responsibilities are.
   The panelists acknowledged that television has exacerbated
the problem of pre-trial publicity and that most people are
inundated with potentially prejudicial visual images of
arrests and arraignments. But, said Mr. Vidmar, "People can
put these aside and say, `I can decide this on the
evidence.'"

   FALSE IMPRESSION LIBEL SUIT reversed by Minnesota Supreme
Court.
   The decision by the Minnesota court had been eagerly
awaited by First Amendment experts because the case involved
claims that a news report created a false impression. Most
plaintiffs in libel cases allege specific factual
inaccuracies.
   Donald J. Diesen, the former Carlton County attorney,
alleged that the Duluth News-Tribune's series concerning his
handling of domestic-abuse cases left the impression he
wasn't enforcing the law in assault cases against women. The
jury had awarded Mr. Diesen more than $750,000.
   The court late last week reversed a lower court decision
and ruled that public officials can't generally prevail in
false-impression suits. The court found that the articles
contained only true statements or opinions and therefore any
implication was constitutionally protected criticism of a
public official. The court also found that facts omitted by
the reporter wouldn't have substantially changed the tenor of
the stories.
   "The way this decision is phrased means a newspaper in
Minnesota can publish a story that intentionally leads the
reader to a defamatory conclusion as long as each sentence is
accurate," says Patrick T. Tierney of Collins, Buckley,
Sauntry &amp; Haugh, a lawyer in St. Paul for Mr. Diesen. Mr.
Tierney says he plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In a lengthy dissent, Justice Lawrence Yetka appeared to
invite the high court to review the case. The decision, he
wrote, "virtually closes the door to a public official for
any recovery." He said the U.S. Supreme Court never intended
to protect news organizations that intentionally publish news
reports that leave a false impression.
   A lawyer for the newspaper, Thomas R. Thibodeau of
Johnson, Killen, Thibodeau &amp; Seiler in Duluth, said the
decision won't totally bar false impression suits.
   But "public officials cannot hope to escape review of
their official conduct by threatening media defendants with
libel suits," he said.

   APPEALS COURT REJECTS CHANGE in election of Texas trial
judges.
   A panel of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned a lower court's December ruling that the
countywide election of trial judges improperly dilutes
minority representation on the bench.
   In a suit brought by the League of United Latin American
Citizens and black judicial candidates, U.S. District Judge
Lucius D. Bunton ordered that trial judges in Texas's nine
largest counties be elected from sub-districts that would
ensure minority election of at least some of the judges.
   But the appeals court on Friday, in a 21 decision written
by Judge Patrick E. Higginbotham, said the remedy ordered by
Judge Bunton "seems to lessen minority influence instead of
increasing it."
   Judges Higginbotham and Carolyn D. King reasoned that the
election of judges from sub-districts wouldn't guarantee that
minority litigants would appear before the judges they
elected because cases would continue to be randomly assigned
to the judges sitting in a particular county. In Houston, for
example, "the minority member would have a 98.3% chance of
appearing before a judge in whose election he had not been
able to vote," Judge Higginbotham wrote.
   "Where judges make their decisions alone, electing judges
from single-member districts only ensures that a small number
of governmental decisions will be influenced by minority
interests, while minority interests will not be represented
at all in the majority of judicial decisions," the judge
wrote.

   U.S. SUPREME COURT READIES computer release of its
decisions.
   With a startup date scheduled for June 1, the high court
selected 12 companies or organizations that for the first
time will transmit its opinions by computer to subscribers as
soon as the opinions are released by the justices in
Washington. The 12 include the Associated Press; United Press
International; Bureau of National Affairs Inc.; Commerce
Clearinghouse Inc.; West Publishing Co.; Mead Data Central
Inc., a Mead Corp. unit; Thomson Group and the Justice
Department.
   Each of the 12 will provide a computer connection to the
court and will pay $500 in the first year for the hookup.
Each may, in turn, sell subscriptions for the opinions.

   Air Canada Says Loss
   For 1st Quarter Was

   MONTREAL -- Air Canada reported a first-quarter loss of 13
million Canadian dollars (US$11.1 million), or 18 Canadian
cents (15 cents U.S.) a share, unchanged from a year earlier.
   The loss, which was expected, came despite a 12% jump in
revenue to C$930 million from C$829 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Excluding one-time gains, the company's operating loss
widened to C$40 million from C$28 million a year earlier.
   Pierre Jeanniot, president and chief executive, said "the
traditionally weak first quarter was made worse by a market
decline and the increase in fuel prices." He said he expected
1990 would be a "difficult year."
   Air Canada's yield per revenue passenger mile -- the
airline's revenue for each mile flown by a paying passenger
-- was 15.9 Canadian cents in the latest period, unchanged
from a year earlier. While yield stayed flat, fuel costs shot
up 24% to C$143 million and labor costs rose 10% to C$307
million.
   The cost increases were partly due to an increase in
capacity. Canada's largest airline had 5.58 billion available
seat miles in the quarter compared with 5.36 billion
available seat miles a year earlier.
   Air Canada posted extraordinary gains totaling C$6 million
from the sale of a DC-8 cargo aircraft and the sale of 10,000
shares of GPA Group PLC, the Irish aircraft leasing concern.

   AIR CANADA'S first-quarter results included 6 million
Canadian dollars (US$5.1 million) net proceeds from the sale
of shares in an investment and an undisclosed amount from the
sale of an aircraft. Yesterday's edition incorrectly
described these sales as extraordinary gains and misstated
the total amount.

   Local Talent Vies to Be Extras
   In Redo of Horror Film;
   Ability to Drool a Plus

   WASHINGTON, Pa. -- Hollywood has discovered the Berry
family.
   It began with Walter Berry. He was drinking coffee at the
counter of Margie's Restaurant -- formerly a hot-dog joint
called the Dog House -- when a director walked up and asked
him to be in a movie being filmed nearby. "I thought someone
was playing a joke on me," says the 53-year-old machine
operator.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Then his kid sister, Ludwina Scott, a 52-year-old
homemaker who envied Shirley Temple's ringlets as a child,
auditioned and won a role. Not to be outdone, the patriarch
of the family, 77-year-old onetime coal miner Charles L.
Berry, joined the cast.
   The Berrys, it seems, are natural zombies, a sort of Brady
Bunch of horror films. They will make their acting debut in
the remake of George Romero's 1969 classic horror film,
"Night of the Living Dead," slated for a Halloween release by
Columbia Pictures.
   "I kind of wonder what I got myself into," says an abashed
Walter Berry. Ludwina says her brother doesn't realize how
perfect he is for the role. She recounts how Walter once
dressed as a musician for a Halloween party at the American
Legion hall. But, as he is tall and skinny, with clear blue
eyes and sunken cheeks, judges unwittingly voted him best
vampire. "And he didn't even have any makeup on," she says.
   Hospital orderlies, waitresses and meatpackers from this
rural area of western Pennsylvania competed for about 150
extra slots, including roles as vigilantes and police
officers. But most dreamed of a shot at zombiedom. "Everyone
wants to be a zombie," says Staci Blagovich, casting director
for extras.
   When a local newspaper ran a story announcing auditions,
hundreds of people from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia
called asking for directions. Fearing an invasion of zombie
zealots, Ms. Blagovich quietly canceled and rescheduled the
audition, moving it from a small church to a fire station,
because the church didn't have a parking lot.
   Other would-be stars wrote to explain why they should be
zombies. One played the demon in the upcoming "Exorcist 90"
who helps pull George C. Scott down to hell. Another said
she, her boyfriend, her neighbor and her neighbor's boyfriend
are "total fans" of monster movies and that this one is
particularly "awesome." She included a picture of herself
with her tongue sticking out and her arms extended as proof
of her potential.
   Still another wrote that her husband would be good for the
part because he acts silly with the couple's Chihuahuas. "He
walks towards them and puts his hands spooky-like above his
head and my little dogs go crazy," she wrote.
   David Kuehls understands the zombie allure. A writer for
Britain's Fear magazine, he played a zombie in a low-budget
movie filmed in Akron, Ohio, called "The Dead Next Door." He
and about 20 other zombies, their faces splattered with fake
blood and caked with gooey stuff, surrounded a human being,
raised their hands in the air and collectively moaned. "It's
fun to walk around and be a monster," he says.
   Here in Pennsylvania, people have a special kinship to
zombies. Twenty years ago and about a half-hour's drive
north, Mr. Romero filmed the original "Night of the Living
Dead." It became a cult classic and put the little town of
Evans City on the map. Locals still talk about huddling as
children outside the cemetery where part of the movie was
filmed and telling ghost stories.
   Mr. Romero, who wrote a revised script and is acting as
executive director, decided on a remake for one reason:
money.
   Apparently, some copies of the first film were
inadvertently distributed without a copyright, which meant
virtually anyone could use the film without paying the movie
makers. As a result, original investors, who pooled their
meager funds to make the $114,000 cult classic, reaped less
than $1 million, even though the movie was translated into 17
languages and launched Mr. Romero's career as a horror-film
guru.
   The $4.2 million color remake, he hopes, will make enough
money to give original backers and copyright owners -- aunts,
grandmothers and uncles -- a reasonable return on their
initial investment. "From my standpoint, this is purely
financial," says Mr. Romero.
   Still, horror-film fanatics can't wait to sink their fangs
into the new "Night of the Living Dead," says Anthony
Timpone, editor of Fangoria magazine. They want to see if 20
years of technology, special effects and a bigger budget can
improve upon the original.
   For one thing, the zombies will be a little classier. The
original zombies were relatives and friends of the movie
makers -- at times, even the movie makers themselves. They
walked mechanically and stared straight ahead. Today's
zombies are sophisticated and take their shot at immortality
seriously.
   They attended two sessions to learn how to stumble, fall
and think like a zombie. This left Edward Evans, who hasn't
exercised since 1943 when he was discharged from the army,
sore for weeks. Bob Kowalski, a self-ascribed entertainer who
performs magic shows and plays bass guitar for local bands,
does 50-yard zombie sprints with his arms flapping slowly,
like an arthritic bird. Brenda Byers studied the original
movie three times before her audition and has adopted a
shuffling feet approach. "It helps to empty your mind," she
explains.
   The elder Mr. Berry, who is missing a few teeth, says he
doesn't have any problems with the role, even though he has
never seen a zombie or the original movie or studied method
acting. He can roll his eyes backward and drop his jaw. And
he is remarkably spry for a 77 year old. "They used to call
me rubber legs on the dance floor," he says proudly. "I guess
even zombies got to have a certain flair."
   It also helps to be a martial-arts instructor. John
Hamilton is kicked, thrown across the kitchen floor and
whacked in the face with a rubber frying pan before getting
nailed in the head with the crowbar. He credits his
showmanship to touring with the Master's World of Karate and
Kung Fu show.
   But if being a zombie is difficult, being eaten alive is
no picnic either. Actress Pat Tallman, who stars as the
heroine, had nightmares after reading the script, especially
the part where a drooling, one-eyed zombie with a Rest In
Peace cross impaled in his shoulder attacks her in the
cemetery. "It's disgusting," she says.
   Locals relish being involved in the movie, be it ever so
humble. A woman in nearby tiny Hopewell Township, where the
film is actually being shot, tells neighbors that the inside
of her yellow Mercedes will be in the film, and that the crew
used her vacuum cleaner. An eye doctor from nearby Robinson
Township offered the use of 70 glass eyes.
   Even the township's Upper Buffalo Presbyterian Church got
into the act. The crew needed a place for New York caterers,
armed with microwave ovens and steamers, to prepare and serve
lunch. The Rev. H. William Dambach consented. The 52-member
church, he says, has its own mission to serve, and besides,
it could use the $125-a-day payment. Now church members won't
have to hold their annual strawberry festival or sell
lemonade at the Washington County fair to help raise $3,000
needed to operate the church for the year.
   Little did Rev. Dambach know that such manna would cause
mayhem. False rumors spread that the film was being shot in
the church and its cemetery. The local presbytery received
calls from Rev. Dambach's peers saying the movie runs counter
to the church's belief in a joyous, not ghoulish,
resurrection. "Frankly, I never thought about it," he says a
little sheepishly. "It's just a movie people see to get
scared."
   It's also cool, declares eight-year-old Joey Ladisic. His
father, Jeff Ladisic, known locally as Dr. Glass, was hired
to replace windshields and windows that are shattered by
zombies. During the filming, he mentioned to directors that
he had a glass eye and would gladly remove it if they needed
an eyeless zombie. They said yes. His wife, Jeannie, was so
thrilled she took her sons out of school to bring them to the
set. Marvels Dr. Glass: "This is a once-in-a lifetime
opportunity."

   FOREIGN OWNERS OF U.S. LAND

   Foreigners own just under 1% of U.S. agricultural land, a
level that has varied little over the years, the Agriculture
Department said.
   The department made its 1989 year-end review under a 1978
law requiring foreigners to register U.S. agricultural land
holdings. As of Dec. 31, 1989, about 12.9 million acres of
agricultural land were owned by foreigners, an increase of
263,273 acres from a year earlier.
   "Foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land remained
relatively steady from 1981 through 1989, slightly above or
below 1% of the privately owned agricultural land in the
U.S.," said John Lee, administrator of the agency.
Corporations owned 81% of the foreign-held acreage;
partnerships, 10%; and individuals, 7%. The remainder is held
by estates, trusts, associations, institutions and others.
   The state of Maine has the heaviest concentration of
foreign ownership, with holdings of almost 2.1 million acres.
                                                                                                       

   TOKYO'S RICE POLICY
                                                                                                       

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said his nation
would maintain a ban on rice imports to protect domestic
growers despite U.S. demands for improved market access.
"Rice and rice cultivation have a special significance for
our country and in light of this we will continue to adhere
to the basic policy of self-sufficiency," Mr. Kaifu told
legislators. Japanese consumers pay up to six times world
prices for domestic rice as the government props up
inefficient rice producers with substantial subsidies.
                                                                                                       

   SWEDISH-HUNGARIAN DEAL
                                                                                                       

   Sweden's largest newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, said it
intends to buy a 45% stake in Magyar Nemzet, Hungary's
second-largest newspaper. Dagens Nyheter said its
negotiations are with the Hungarian state-owned publisher
Pallas, which owns Magyar Nemzet. According to the deal,
Dagens Nyheter and Pallas will own 45% each of the stock of
the newly formed newspaper corporation. The remaining 10%
will be controlled by a journalist organization. Dagens
Nyheter wouldn't reveal the price of the deal.
                                                                                                       

   CHINESE AID FOR LIBYA
                                                                                                       

   China will send 350 technical advisers to Libya's Misurata
Iron &amp; Steel Complex, the official China Daily said. The
technicians will work in hot and cold rolling mills and a
steel-smelting shop, the paper said. They will join 430
Chinese workers and engineers already working in other parts
of the Libyan complex. The Chinese workers come from the
Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel Complex in central China.
                                                                                                       

   DENUNCIATION IN SWITZERLAND
                                                                                                       

   A prominent Swiss animal-rights campaigner denounced
government plans to allow sales of dog and cat meat as
"monstrous and obscene." Franz Weber, writing in Lausanne's
Le Matin newspaper, charged the proposed law endorsed "a kind
of cannibalism" and would "lower us to the level of the
disparaged monsters of the Philippines and Korea." Swiss
authorities have proposed a revision of 1954 food regulations
that would drop the ban on butchers' selling dog and cat
meat.
                                                                                                       

   NORTH ATLANTIC FISHING
                                                                                                       

   The European Community is willing to study North Atlantic
fish stocks in a bid to resolve Canadian concerns the
resource is being dangerously depleted, EC Fisheries
Commissioner Manuel Marin said. "I think we will be able to
demonstrate the European Community is not the first enemy of
Canadian interests," he said in Ottawa. Canadian fishermen
are concerned about European boats plying the waters just
beyond Canada's 200-mile economic zone and have been
demanding action from Ottawa.
                                                                                                       

   ANOTHER DOCKLANDS DEFECTOR
                                                                                                       

   Stanhope Properties PLC has withdrawn from the Royal Docks
redevelopment project in the London Docklands. It is the
second development company to quit the area this year.
   Announcing the Stanhope decision, the London Docklands
Development Corp. blamed the "continuing deterioration of the
property market." Redevelopment of the area, formerly the
site of the decaying docks in London's East End, has been
spotlighted by the Thatcher government as a showcase for the
benefits of free enterprise; but it has been hard hit for
over a year by high base bank-interest rates, which have
undermined property values.
   At the start of this year, the development company
Rosehaugh PLC, which had been in partnership with Stanhope in
the Royal Docks project, announced it was quitting. The
260-acre Royal Docks project for a shopping center, business
park and leisure complex was one of the largest development
sites in London.
   "The (Stanhope) withdrawal leaves in tatters the London
Docklands Development Corp.'s plans to regenerate one of the
most neglected areas of the East End," the Times of London
commented.

   Iranian vice patrols arrested 20 people in Tehran at the
start of a crackdown on clothing that reveals too many curves
or too much flesh. The new campaign is called "Fight
Manifestations of Corruption." . . . Most single Japanese
women think the main reason they haven't yet married is a
scarcity of "nice men," according to a survey conducted by
the Altmann Institute, a Tokyo matchmaking agency. The survey
defined a "nice man" as one who was good-looking,
intelligent, talkative, honest and highly paid.

   AMSTERDAM -- Heineken Nederland B.V. and Grolsch
Bierbrouwerij N.V., two Dutch beer brewers, have embarked on
a process of advertising agency musical chairs in an effort
to separate themselves from each other.
   The ad agency war began earlier in the year when Heineken
switched from using a number of local agencies to represent
its European accounts to consolidating all of them with the
London office of J. Walter Thompson.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, Grolsch had been using the Amsterdam-based office
of J. Walter Thompson, known as PPTH-JWT, to represent it in
the Netherlands. In response, the company has announced that
it has dropped PPTH-JWT in favor of FHV/ BBDO, the
Netherlands subsidiary of BBDO.
   "Heineken chose J. Walter Thompson for the whole of
Europe, so we had to seek another agency," said a spokesman
for Grolsch.
   Unfortunately, FHV-BBDO also represented Heineken's Amstel
brand of beer. Heineken retaliated by pulling its Amstel
account from FHV-BBDO and placing the account with the Dutch
subsidiary of Young &amp; Rubicam, known as PMSWY&amp;R.
   "The announced cooperation between FHV-BBDO and Grolsch
came as a surprise to Heineken Nederland," Heineken said in a
statement.
   Heineken said that it regretted FHV-BBDO's decision, but
noted, "PMS-WY&amp;R could be appointed without any hesitation."

   Californians Test
   Heated Converter
   To Counter Smog

   LOS ANGELES -- California smogfighters who have been
pushing clean fuels as the best way to cut toxic vehicle
emissions are testing a device that they say could help keep
gasoline-powered cars on the road into the next century.
   The device is a new kind of catalytic converter, heated by
electricity from the car battery, that eliminates 50% to 90%
of exhaust pollutants, researchers say. By kicking in sooner
than conventional models, the converter lessens the initial
burst of emissions after the engine is turned on.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This shows the potential for existing technology to
compete with other alternatives in the market" that will be
created by tough new standards recently proposed for the
mid-1990s by the California Air Resources Board, said agency
spokesman Bill Sessa. "Up until now, most of our attention
has been focused on alternative fuels like methanol, natural
gas and electricity."
   Cars don't pollute the same for every mile they are
driven. The "cold start" -- the first few seconds after the
engine is turned on -- is the most polluting part of any
trip. Over the years, makers of catalytic converters have
moved them closer to the engine so that the devices warm up
faster. By adding a heater, the converter reacts in a split
second.
   The state agency said it is encouraged by results of
recent tests on a Toyota Camry and a Volkswagen Golf that
were equipped with the quick-heating converter, made by Camet
Co., a Hiram, Ohio, affiliate of W.R. Grace &amp; Co. Other
manufacturers are working on similar products, but Mr. Sessa
said the agency's technical staff believes that Camet is
further along than its rivals.
   "Our converter can do the equivalent of what alternative
fuels {can do}; and it's much less disruptive because the
existing gasoline supply system is well-developed and
economical," said Richard Cornelison, Camet president and
founder. Camet said its heated converter would be used in
addition to a conventional converter.
   Camet is testing its converter in U.S. and foreign cars to
see if it can withstand mechanical abuse and perform on road
tests. The device is designed for installation in new cars,
rather than retrofitted, because it requires engine
control-system modifications and a more powerful battery. On
a mass-produced basis, the converter could be sold to car
makers for $125 to $150 apiece, Mr. Cornelison said.
   In test vehicles, the driver turns a key and waits a few
seconds until an indicator light goes out, then starts the
engine. Car makers would design a system that prevented the
car from starting until the converter turned on. Or, the
converter could be preheated through a sensor in a door
handle or seat belt.
   "All of the evidence isn't in on these new catalytic
converters; they don't have the track record we have with
methanol and other fuels," cautioned a spokesman for the
South Coast Air Quality Management District, a regional
agency in Southern California. In any event, clean fuels are
likely to remain the best hope for reducing pollutants in
buses and trucks that aren't equipped with converters.
   California, through the Air Resources Board, is the only
state that sets new-vehicle anti-smog standards that are
separate from those of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. The state has proposed that by 1997 a quarter of the
cars sold in the state would have to emit 70% fewer
smog-forming hydrocarbons than required by a tough 1994
standard. By 1998, half of all cars sold would have to meet
the stricter standard. The standards go beyond those proposed
in the federal Clean Air Act, Mr. Sessa said.

   Worthington to Report 4th-Quarter Net
   Slipped, but Period to Be Best for Year

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
STEEL MANUFACTURERS (STL)
</IN>
<LP>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Worthington Industries Inc. has
experienced a marked upturn in steel processing, its largest
business, which will make the fourth quarter by far the
strongest profit period for fiscal 1990, John H. McConnell,
chairman and chief executive officer said.
   Profit for the quarter, ending May 31, is likely to be
only a little lower than the 49 cents a share from continuing
operations in the strong year-ago period, he said in an
interview. For the first nine months, profit from continuing
operations declined 16% to 90 cents a share from $1.06 a
share in the comparable 1989 period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales for the fourth quarter probably will be slightly
higher than the $265.5 million from continuing operations in
the year-ago period, Mr. McConnell said. Higher sales of
processed steel will more than offset lower sales of plastic
products, mainly auto parts.
   For fiscal 1991, unless the overall economy takes a dive,
Worthington will have record profit for the year, Mr.
McConnell said. A major factor in the brighter 1991 outlook,
he said, is an increase in the number of car models that will
use Worthington's instrument panels and other plastic parts.
The company also will be aided by the stronger steel market,
major new facilities and higher demand for railroad castings,
he said.
   For the fiscal 1989 fourth quarter, Worthington had net
income of $20.8 million, or 51 cents a share, including two
cents a share from a pipe fittings business sold last
January.
   Mr. McConnell didn't make a specific earnings estimate for
the fiscal year, but he indicated that profit from continuing
operations will exceed $1.30 a share. The discontinued pipe
fittings operations will cost the company five cents a share
for fiscal 1990, all in the first nine months.
   For fiscal 1989, Worthington earned $1.55 a share from
continuing operations. Net income was $64.2 million, or $1.58
a share, a record high.
   Sales for fiscal 1990 will be down slightly from fiscal
1989 sales from continuing operations of $939.3 million, Mr.
McConnell said.
   While it is too early to make a precise forecast of 1991
results, Mr. McConnell said analyst estimates ranging from
$1.60 a share to $1.75 a share "appear reasonable." Sales
will exceed $1 billion, he said.
   Directors are likely to consider a dividend increase at a
meeting later this month, he said. The board last August
raised the quarterly rate to 14 cents, from 12 cents.
   Worthington Industries Inc.'s steel processing business
"is doing real well" Mr. McConnell said. Demand began picking
up early in the year, and orders for both March and April
were higher than a year earlier, he said. Sales have improved
at all 10 locations where Worthington processes and
distributes steel, he said, indicating higher production at a
wide range of industries from automobiles to lawn and garden
equipment.
   "Pricing is coming back" after a period of widespread
steel price discounting, he added. "Our margins are much
better than they were in the third quarter," which ended Feb.
28, he said. The low point for steel processing margins came
in November, he said, but margins remained under pressure for
another quarter.
   As a result, operating profits for steel processing in the
current quarter will exceed year-ago levels, he said.
   Startup costs at a new processing plant in Porter, Ind.,
which is four times the size of the Chicago plant it is
replacing, are cutting into steel processing profits in
fiscal 1990, he said. However, the plant, which will cost
about $40 million when completed in calendar 1991, will
contribute to profits next fiscal year, he said.
   Worthington also is expanding facilities that stamp out
rough shapes for customers, ranging from auto parts to garden
shovels, Mr. McConnell said. That business "is growing by
leaps and bounds," as Worthington buys more presses and signs
up new customers, he said.
   Lower profits from plastic products are a major factor in
Worthington's expected fiscal 1990 earnings drop, Mr.
McConnell said. Changes in car models and relocation of some
auto production reduced sales, he said, and industry output
dropped in the calendar 1990 first quarter. In addition, a
new joint venture with a Japanese concern to make parts for
Japanese-owned auto plants will have a loss in fiscal 1990
because of startup costs, but it has gone into the black in
the last few months.
   However, "we have business booked for 1991 models that
assure us of a tremendous year at plastics without any big
increase in car sales," Mr. McConnell said. Production of
instrument panels and other parts for 1991 models will begin
in June, he said.
   Sales of steel castings are increasing, mainly because of
higher railroad car business, he said. For fiscal 1990, both
sales and operating profits will be slightly lower, he said,
"but they're ending the year pretty strong." The company's
foundry makes undercarriages, couplers and other parts for
freight cars and rapid transit cars.
   However, sales of steel cylinders for compressed gases are
lower this year, he said, probably because of a new federal
tax on refrigerant gases, he said. Profit margins are holding
up well, however, because of new production methods that
reduced costs, he said. While refrigerants account for less
than half the company's cylinder sales, sales to the
technicians who service air conditioning equipment still are
a major market. Sales for gas barbecue grills, camping
equipment and other applications are strong, he said.
   Worthington Industries Inc. will invest about $60 million
in new facilities during fiscal 1990, one-third more than the
$45.1 million of 1989, said Joseph H. Stegmayer, vice
president and chief financial officer. That figure excludes
investment in the plastics joint venture, he said. The
recently completed joint venture plant, 60% owned by
Worthington, cost $12 million to $15 million, but it is being
financed separately, he said.
   The company has bought back two million of its shares over
the last two years, and has board authorization to buy back
another one million shares, he said. At year end, the company
will have about 39.5 million shares outstanding.
   Facilities spending and stock buy-backs in fiscal 1990
will be financed from cash flow and the proceeds of about $25
million from sale of the pipe fittings unit, Mr. Stegmayer
said. Worthington will have $25 million or more of cash and
short-term investments at year end, compared with $43.1
million a year earlier.
   Capital spending in fiscal 1991 is likely to be lower, he
said, but the company hasn't completed a review of all
spending requests from the divisions. Internally generated
cash will handle the 1991 spending, he said.

   Suntory's New Chief Has Bold Plans
   To Diversify in Japan and Overseas

   TOKYO -- Suntory Ltd.'s new president, Shinichiro Torii,
is pushing to find new areas for diversification -- in Japan
and abroad.
   "We want to set an image of providing good drinks, food
and services in the U.S., and all around the world," says the
52-year-old Mr. Torii, who last month inherited the mantle of
his family's 90-year-old liquor empire.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Torii succeeds his 70-year-old uncle, Keizo Saji, who
ran the company for 30 years and who will remain as chairman.
During that time, Osaka-based Suntory has developed into
Japan's largest spirits producer and a major liquor importer.
It markets Jack Daniel's and Budweiser in Japan, among other
brands, and runs vineyards in France and California.
   But Suntory's key businesses are facing tough times.
Spirits sales, the company's main trade, are hardly growing.
Beer sales are stuck at 10% market share, last among Japan's
four brewers. Recent growth has come mainly from Suntory's
smaller divisions, such as wine, soft drinks and canned soup.
   The new president has already set an ambitious goal of
increasing sales of overseas business by nearly 20-fold to
one trillion yen ($6.18 billion). That is likely to include
acquisitions: Mr. Torii recently has been trumpeting his
intention to acquire a U.S. food company, although he
declines to identify any potential targets. Suntory already
markets a range of food products in Japan, including Haagen
Dazs ice cream and vegetable juice produced by Campbell Soup
Co.
   In the past five years, Suntory has invested more than 30
billion yen to acquire seven East Coast distributers of
bottled water in the U.S., forming the Suntory Water Group.
This month, the company is starting to market its own beer in
the U.S.; it aims to sell 50,000 cases by the end of the
year.
   Prime targets for expansion, Mr. Torii believes, are the
leisure and entertainment industries. "The Japanese have to
enjoy their lives, and not be workaholics," he says. "Sports
and entertainment -- those are the areas we want to diversify
into." The company recently paid an estimated $3 million to
acquire a majority stake in the Birmingham Barons, a minor
league baseball team in Alabama. Last month, it announced a
tie-up with Jack Nicklaus and Mitsubishi Corp. to build a
Japanese golf course, and in a few years intends to build
golf resorts in the U.S.
   Last year, Suntory started investing an estimated $1
million a year to co-produce Broadway musicals, such as "City
of Angels" and "The Grapes of Wrath," through a partnership
with the Schubert Organization. If the musicals prove
successful in the U.S., Suntory hopes to bring them back to
Japan.
   "The company had a weak spot for culture from before,"
says Shuichi Shibanuma, an analyst for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
in Tokyo. "That's something it can do because it's a
privately owned company," he says. Suntory last year spent
more than 10 billion yen on its burgeoning entertainment
division.
   Not all of the company's investments in entertainment have
been successful. Five years ago, the company spent $15
million on a project with trading house C. Itoh &amp; Co. and
Tokyo Broadcasting System, television network, to bring to
Japan such movies as "Fatal Beauty," "Bright Lights, Big
City" and "Betrayed." The films all flopped. Suntory is now
sticking to producing cartoons in Japan, but is studying
future opportunities in Hollywood, a company spokesman says.
Mr. Torii says he has no immediate plans to invest in movie
studios.
   Last year, Suntory posted sales of 777 billion yen, down
from an estimated 781.5 billion yen in 1988. (Suntory changed
its fiscal year after 1988, making a year-to-year comparison
difficult.) The drop in revenue came in part from a reduction
of Japan's liquor tax, which is included in sales figures.
But even in volume terms, Suntory's $439 billion of spirits
sales grew only 1% to 216 million liters.
   Operating profit in 1989 totaled 26.7 billion yen. Figures
for the comparable period in 1988 aren't available.

   Mexican Congress
   Approves Proposal
   To Privatize Banks

   MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's lower house of Congress approved a
constitutional amendment that will allow the return of the
commercial banking system to private investors. Even before
the vote, which would repeal the 1982 bank nationalization,
there were indications the plan was fortifying the confidence
of Mexican investors.
   The proposal by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was
passed Saturday by a vote of 339 to 54, with 12 abstentions.
The amendment needed approval of two-thirds of the 500-member
lower house.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bill overcame its only obstacle when deputies from the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party pledged to the
conservative National Action Party to draft restrictions on
banking monopolies and preferential lending to the
government. The amendment is expected to win approval easily
in the Senate and state legislatures, which are controlled by
the ruling party.
   Analysts say the state's 66% stake in the 18 commercial
banks could sell for between $3.5 billion and $6.5 billion.
The government hasn't indicated how or when it will sell off
its holdings.
   The move to privatize the banks has already cheered
Mexican investors. Last week, Mexican interest rates tumbled
to 36.6% from 42.6%. At the lower level, the government would
save about $3 billion in interest payments annually on its
domestic debt. Interest rates are high in Mexico to encourage
investors to keep their savings in pesos. The government is
hoping the banking privatization will show the state is
serious about overhauling the economy and inspire the
repatriation of some of the $80 billion Mexicans hold abroad.
   Important issues remain to be resolved this summer when
Congress debates the regulatory framework of the privatized
financial system. Some politicians want tight limits on the
bank stock holdings of individual investors. There is also
discussion over the extent to which foreigners should
participate in the banking system and whether to keep at
least one of the big commercial banks in state hands.
   Observers were surprised the move to privatize banks
didn't generate more controversy. One poll showed only 15% of
those questioned opposed the idea, while more than one-third
had no idea it was being considered. It was no coincidence,
analysts say, that Mr. Salinas scheduled the Congressional
debate to coincide with last week's visit by Pope John Paul
II, which captivated millions of Mexicans.
   Even so, the bank privatization, coupled with Mexico's
recent decision to hold talks with the U.S. on a free-trade
agreement, manifests a new boldness on the part of Mexican
policymakers, analysts say.
   Mexico has sold or liquidated about 700 state-run
enterprises since 1986, but only recently has Mr. Salinas
focused on important but politically delicate sectors such as
finance, telephones and steel. Before his first
state-of-the-union address last November, he never publicly
uttered the word "privatization," opting instead for the less
politically charged "disincorporation."
   Analysts say the president is stepping up the pace of
economic reforms out of the realization that the initiatives
he launched in his first year in office have achieved only
modest benefits. Last year, his key economic-policy
accomplishments were the renegotiation of Mexico's $93
billion foreign debt and a liberalization of the
nationalistic foreign-investment law. But neither measure has
guaranteed Mexico the capital inflows it urgently needs to
cover a deficit in its current account, the broadest measure
of trade, estimated at between $4 billion and $5 billion.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Theater:
   Kevin Kline's Mutable Dane
   ----

   New York -- As unfortunate audiences at the New York
Public Theater's star-struck Shakespeare Festival have found,
American movie idols aren't too adept at putting on tights
and reciting 16th-century verse. Pluck a pretty face off the
silver screen and put it behind the footlights, and all too
often the result is cornball classics. (More to the point,
another result is full houses.)
   But Kevin Kline is definitely no cornball in the Public's
new production of "Hamlet." Mr. Kline, who last year won an
Oscar for best supporting actor as a hilarious thug in "A
Fish Called Wanda," is currently turning in a technically
precise performance as the melancholy Dane in a carefully
calibrated production he directed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kline isn't the noble Hamlet, or the indecisive
Hamlet, or the neurotic, introspective or intellectual
Hamlet. He doesn't let any single emotion take over, which
leaves him exposed to the charge of being passionless. But
Hamlet is open to innumerable interpretations, and it is
because Mr. Kline chooses not to focus on one but to juggle
many that he is so believable.
   His rejection scene with Ophelia is the best example. When
he first catches sight of her, his face lights up with joy.
But then he spits insults at her. His voice will drop to a
tender whisper and he'll clasp her in his arms, only to shake
her in fury a moment later. The emotional swirl is just
right.
   He also does nicely with Hamlet's skittish moods. He
needles the interfering Polonius with an edgy blend of verve
and venom, and he baits his mousetrap play-within-a-play with
a lunatic intensity that turns into sarcastic politeness when
Gertrude and Claudius appear.
   A fairly strong cast helps Mr. Kline along. Especially
fine is Josef Sommer as the bombastic Polonius, whom Mr.
Sommer plays as a dangerous meddler and without the
buffoonery often brought to the role. This comes out best in
his scenes with Ophelia, whose behavior toward Hamlet he
directs with horrible severity.
   Diane Venora makes a sorrowful Ophelia, who doesn't have
the spirit to disobey her domineering father's instructions
on how to test her lover's fidelity. She has superb control
over her voice, which slides in and out of heart-rending sobs
during her rejection scene with Hamlet and soars into a
terrible falsetto as she sings her mad ditties.
   Dana Ivey, the original driven Miss Daisy in the 1987
off-Broadway production of Alfred Uhry's play, isn't driven
as mother Gertrude, whom she plays rather matter-of-factly.
Brian Murray is even more mundane as Claudius. Could this
impassive man have committed murder in order to inherit his
brother's crown and his brother's wife? The surprising
exception to his otherwise soulless performance is the
soliloquy in which he tries unsuccessfully to beg forgiveness
from God. As his intellect grapples with his emotions, it is
as if he is comprehending his hideous deeds for the first
time.
   Mr. Kline makes his directorial debut here and does a
serviceable job. This production isn't a feast for the eyes.
The cast is in unremarkable modern dress. And the set is as
spare as they come -- just two black pillars and the
requisite curtain behind which Polonius hides and then meets
his death.
   ---
   Also playing at the Public is "Ice Cream With Hot Fudge,"
a pair of monotonous one-act comedies by Caryl Churchill, the
anti-Thatcherite whose "Serious Money" was a hit a couple of
years ago among London and New York Yuppies who love to hate
themselves.
   In "Hot Fudge," the first and shorter of the pair, Ms.
Churchill lashes out at the acquisitive classes. The best
that can be said about it is that there are a few amusing
minutes spent on a discussion of expensive vacations, which
the characters consider an inalienable right. "People ought
to swim with dolphins," says one. Another (a crass American,
of course) is into "self-development holidays;" she likes to
lie poolside and "visualize" her tennis game.
   In "Ice Cream," an Anglophile American couple look up
distant relatives in England and get caught up in a violent
incident. Ten scenes are set in England and 10 more take
place in the U.S., when the long-lost cousins come calling.
About the only difference between them is that in the first
ten, the Americans are boobs abroad, and in the second they
are boobs at home.
   ---
   "Once on the Island" (Playwrights Horizons) is a breezy
reggae musical. With music by Stephen Flaherty and book and
lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, it is based on a novel by Trinidadian
author Rosa Guy.
   Set on an island in the French Antilles, the story is a
variation on an old standby: An uptown boy falls in love with
a beautiful girl from across the tracks. In this Caribbean
version, the girl is a black peasant and the boy is a mulatto
landowner. The tale is told by four conniving island gods and
goddesses, who give fate a shove and do the matchmaking.
   But the story is largely immaterial. It's just a way to
propel the cast of 11 spirited singers and dancers into one
charming number after another. Of the show's 16 songs, my
favorite was "Mama Will Provide." In it, Mother Earth (Kecia
Lewis-Evans) belts out a warm melody while the syncopated
background music is sung by the others, mimicking birds,
trees, frogs and breezes.
   The simple set is as friendly as the play itself; tropical
birds and flowers are painted on sky-blue walls and a
sea-green floor. If you don't pay too close attention to
"Island's" lyrics, which are about as unsophisticated as the
plot, you'll have a cheery hour and a half.

   Mr. Coffee Brews Initial Public Offer
   To Rise From Leveraged Buy-Out Debt

   NEW YORK -- Mr. Coffee will soon join the ranks of
companies that went private through leveraged buy-outs but
are now turning to the equity markets for relief from too
much debt.
   By early June, the company's initial public offering of
four million shares is expected to be priced between $9 and
$11 each. Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. is leading the underwriting
syndicate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of the four million shares being offered, three million
are being sold by the company and one million by existing
shareholders.
   This "reverse LBO" phenomenon is the flip side of the
1980's buy-out craze, when many companies went private with
heaps of debt. Analysts say high interest rates and a slowing
economy are now putting pressure on some of these companies
to raise cash to pay debt.
   But the market hasn't been very kind to recent "reverse
LBOs." So far this year such deals have generally come to
market at the low end or below their original price talk
range. Geneva Steel, for example, went public in March at $10
a share, far below its price talk of $14 to $16 a share. And
the offering Rival Co., another kitchen appliance maker, has
been postponed.
   But analysts cite a host of concerns about Mr. Coffee:
   The company still carries a large debt; its business is
currently based on a single product line; its market is
mature and crowded with well-financed competitors; about
one-third of its sales go to just five customers; and nearly
half its production is based in China and Hong Kong.
   But there's another side.
   Proceeds from Mr. Coffee's offering will slash the
company's long-term debt to about 53% of its total capital
from 83%. And the company states in its preliminary
prospectus that it has been moving much of its manufacturing
back home.
   Perhaps most important to prospective investors, the
company is making money once again for the first time since
1986.
   Mr. Coffee's resurgence to profitability comes on the back
of a product -- an iced tea maker called The Iced Tea Pot --
which it introduced in May 1989. The product accounted for
nearly all of the company's 24% sales increase in 1989, and
nearly all of 1990's first quarter 53% growth in sales.
   "After that initial burst of sales, it's really unknown as
to what's going to happen," says Robert Natale, who tracks
new issues for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Kimberly Rawn, director of communications at the National
Houseware Manufacturers Association, says the product drew a
lot of attention at the association's show last year and is
expected to be a big seller.
   Some consumers may realize, however, that they can make
iced tea in their existing coffee machine.
   And Al Hadhazy, an analyst for New Issues, a newsletter
that reviews initial public offerings, warns, "If things slow
down to a crawl and consumers bow out for a while, this
product isn't going anywhere."
   But Ian Gittlitz, publisher of Homeworld Business, a
bi-weekly newspaper on housewares, argues that a slowdown in
spending could boost Mr. Coffee's sales. Retailers, looking
for more bang for their buck in a slow environment, favor
recognized brand names and promotional items, he says.
   Mr. Coffee was bought by its current owners from the
founders of the company for $72 million in 1987. Nearly three
years later, most of that debt remains -- including $35.4
million in "junk" bonds on which it must pay interest of
16.5%.
   When Mr. Coffee pays off two-thirds of its debt, as it
intends to do following the offering, $37 million in term and
revolving credit notes will remain. Scheduled repayments of
the term loan portion of that debt will begin this year.
Also, Mr. Coffee will have a negative net tangible book value
of nearly $3 a share.
   The existing shareholders paid an average of $7.63 for
each of their shares, with much of that money paid in 1988 to
help the company out of its cash squeeze.
   If the offering is priced in the middle of its offering
range, those investors will have earned about 30% on their
money in almost three years. While that's better than the
total return of S&amp;P's 500-Stock Index over the same period,
it's hardly a stellar return for a buy-out investor.
   Among those selling stock is Quantum Fund N.V., managed by
George Soros. Quantum is selling about 29% of the 344,001 Mr.
Coffee shares that it owns.
   None of the selling shareholders could be reached for
comment.

   Bankers See Real-Estate Credit Pinch,
   Say Session With Regulators Was Useful

   HOT SPRINGS, Va. -- Leaders of some of the nation's
largest banks said they see clear signs of a credit pinch in
real estate and suggested that last week's meeting between
bankers and the top three banking regulators could help
prevent a broader pullback in lending.
   Joining top corporate executives from a variety of
industries for a weekend conference in this mountain resort,
bankers generally welcomed last Thursday's unusual private
meeting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It will be useful," said John Reed, chairman of Citicorp.
"To have these three gentlemen meeting with the bankers can
only be good."
   In the meeting with officials of the American Bankers
Association, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,
along with William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., and Robert Clarke, comptroller of the
currency, tried to allay fears that new, tougher supervision
by banking regulators would punish prudent lending. Though
the regulators denied that the session was prompted by
concern that a credit crunch threatened the economy, they
urged banks not to overreact to regulators' increased
scrutiny of lending practices.
   Asked if the message was received by bankers, Lewis
Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., said: "I'm sure it
would be."
   In reaction to huge losses on real-estate loans,
particularly in the Southwest, banking regulators have
stepped up their policing of lending in recent years. But
many bankers believe that regulators have overreacted, going
so far, for instance, as to require some banks to increase
reserves even for loans classified as performing.
   While several banking leaders here said the stricter
supervision was warranted, given the fiasco in their sister
savings-and-loan industry, they expressed concern that
regulators could have gone too far.
   "I think they had to tighten down," said Mr. Reed of
Citicorp. "On the other hand, there is no question that they
have sent a ripple through the market that is causing people
to withdraw. . . . There is clearly a significant withdrawal
of capital from the real estate market."
   "I don't know whether they're being overzealous or not,
but one wants to be certain that you don't spook an
industry," said Willard C. Butcher, chairman of Chase
Manhattan Bank.
   He added: "I think the concern by banking regulators is
healthy, but you're always walking a narrow plank between
being part of the solution and part of the problem."
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman, interviewed
yesterday on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," also
said that bankers should adopt a balanced approach. "There's
anecdotal evidence that -- especially in New England -- there
has been perhaps a little overcorrection, but I don't want to
see it swing all the way back in the other direction," he
said.
   To date, the bankers said they saw no evidence of a
pullback in lending beyond the troubled real-estate industry.
But, Mr. Preston of J.P. Morgan said, "I think this is an
issue in terms of attitudes."
   Many of the business leaders attending the weekend meeting
of the Business Council, an association of chief executives
from the country's largest corporations, also heralded
President Bush's indication that he will discuss taxes at the
budget negotiations set to begin tomorrow.
   While many conservatives are upset at what they see as a
retreat by Mr. Bush from his "read-my-lips" campaign pledge
of no new taxes, several corporate executives here indicated
that any serious deficit-reduction package would have to
include some new taxes.
   "It is unrealistic to believe you can get a substantial
{deficit reduction} without some new taxes," said Chase
Manhattan's Mr. Butcher.
   Nevertheless, most echoed the attitude of Edmund Pratt
Jr., chairman of Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical and
health-care company, who declared: "If there are new taxes,
they ought to be used only to reduce the budget deficit" and
not spent on new programs.
   The executives also said government officials should stay
away from excise taxes that can harm the competitiveness of
American industries.
   "The only kind of tax we should raise is the personal or
corporate income tax," said Andrew Sigler, chairman of
Champion International Corp., a paper and wood-products
company. "I think I'd prefer to see it on the personal side."

   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam -- Nguyen Van Muoi Hai wasn't
one to hide his success.
   As his perfume and toiletries business grew, he bought
luxurious limousines and equipped himself with cordless
phones, fax machines and a dazzling array of electronic
gadgetry. He took to traveling in a convoy of cars, escorted
by helmeted bodyguards on motorbikes, their sirens screaming.
When the motorcade reached its destination, the outriders
would dismount and form two lines for him to pass through. An
aide would open the door and bow: "Welcome, general director.
You have arrived."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That sort of fanfare, worthy of a head of state, would
have drawn attention anywhere. In impoverished Vietnam, it
caused a sensation.
   The youthful Mr. Muoi Hai, usually accompanied by his
glamorous wife, acquired celebrity status as his
rags-to-riches fame spread. He appeared frequently in
newspaper advertisements and television commercials promoting
his Thanh Huong Perfume Factory and its range of fragrances
and shampoos. He offered investors in the company's credit
cooperative higher and higher returns, and people responded
by lining up by the thousands to put their savings in Thanh
Huong.
   It all must have seemed too good to be true -- and it was.
   The authorities recently arrested 32-year-old Mr. Muoi Hai
and his associates, and closed the business. Initial
inquiries show that they were running a classic pyramid
scheme, paying early investors with money poured in by later
ones. Little of the money actually went into the business;
instead, it was diverted to buying cars and houses. In fact,
investigators say, there wasn't even a factory: Mr. Muoi Hai
was merely adding water to cheap imported perfume and
relabeling it for the local market.
   The reaction to Mr. Muoi Hai's arrest was immediate and
tumultuous. Hundreds of people -- in the biggest
demonstrations since the Communists took over South Vietnam
in 1975 -- gathered daily for a week to demand that city
authorities here help them get their money back. That set off
runs on other credit cooperatives, as the secondary banks in
the country are called. The spreading panic quickly paralyzed
Vietnam's credit system. As it stands, most credit
cooperatives and some private companies are now unable to
repay depositors. Investors have learned that many of the
businesses -- far from being a sure bet -- have lost their
money on highly speculative ventures.
   The government is getting the lion's share of the blame
for the crisis. Critics say it acted without thinking when it
implemented certain reforms in 1987 to help shift from a
centrally planned to a market economy. There simply wasn't
enough regulation to prevent schemers from exploiting the
situation, they say.
   But if good intentions on the part of reformers begat
banking chaos, it also loosened the bonds on the country's
censored press. And it was ultimately the press that was Mr.
Muoi Hai's undoing.
   As officials tell it, the trouble started when reformers
set out to create a banking system for Vietnam. They gave the
State Bank of Vietnam, the central bank, the task of
regulating money and credit. Newly created institutions,
called specialized banks, were entrusted with the frontline
work of providing cash and credit to depositors and
businesses.
   According to Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a government economic
adviser, the specialized banks, which are owned by the state,
failed to perform their function. They attracted only a
fraction of the money held by the public and didn't readily
extend loans to new entrepreneurs.
   As a result, "credit cooperatives jumped in to fill the
void," says Mr. Oanh, a former central bank governor of South
Vietnam. "No legislation, no rules, no nothing."
   By early last year, the privately run credit cooperatives
were popping up everywhere -- "like mushrooms after the
rain," in the words of a local journalist. By the end of the
year, when the government ordered that no more be permitted
to open, there were about 20 credit cooperatives in Hanoi and
170 in Ho Chi Minh City, as well as dozens of others in
nearby provinces.
   Some sought to act as financial intermediaries -- taking
in deposits and lending out money -- and others were formed
by private companies seeking capital for their own expansion.
While the specialized banks initially paid 8% a month, the
unrestrained credit cooperatives offered 10%. Soon,
cooperatives were engaged in cutthroat competition with each
other for deposits, pushing interest rates ever higher.
   Nobody wooed potential depositors as ardently as Mr. Muoi
Hai, a one-time used-clothes hawker with limited formal
education who set up Thanh Huong to take advantage of new
government policies encouraging private enterprise.
   Thanh Huong named its perfumes after famous overseas
products, such as "Charlie" and "Caresse." Similarly, it's
packaging and promotions borrowed freely from foreign
advertisements. But Mr. Muoi Hai, who couldn't be reached for
comment for this article, didn't attempt to sell his products
as much as his company. Over and over, he assured investors
that Thanh Huong was enjoying tremendous success and anyone
could get a piece of the action.
   Vietnamese say people sold family jewelry and lined up for
hours to put their money in Thanh Huong's credit cooperative,
especially when the return reached a staggering 15% a month.
So heavy and sustained was the rush that a black market
developed in the numbered slips indicating order of service
that were handed out to those waiting to invest.
   With money pouring in, Thanh Huong continued to expand,
opening highly visible retail outlets in hotels and at Ho Chi
Minh City's Tan Son Nhut airport. But not everyone was
impressed. Tuoi tre, a Ho Chi Minh City newspaper, in
particular was suspicious.
   Editors noticed that one of Thanh Huong's four deputy
directors was a man who had quit as head of a large
state-owned detergent concern after being exposed for taking
bribes. Another deputy director was a former police
lieutenant colonel who had left the force after he was
convicted of torturing a man to death. In addition, the
company's products didn't seem popular, and Mr. Muoi Hai
refused to open his operations to inspection on the grounds
that he didn't want competitors to know his secrets.
   When Tuoi tre published an article in 1988 expressing
doubts about Thanh Huong, Mr. Muoi Hai responded with a
hand-delivered letter that the paper interpreted as a death
threat. Mr. Muoi Hai later invited the paper's deputy
editor-in-chief, Tran Ngoc Chau, to his office. "He claimed
to have many products and customers," says Mr. Chau. "I told
him I didn't believe him and that I wanted to see his
factory. All I got was words."
   Thanh Huong wasn't the only business attracting suspicion.
The press was also investigating Xacogiva, a company founded
by Pham Cong Tuoc, a former construction worker now about 55
years old.
   Xacogiva endeared itself to the government by building a
few units of low-cost housing that Ho Chi Minh City
authorities allocated to the homeless. Nguyen Van Linh,
general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, visited
the housing site with Mr. Tuoc, giving him a widely
publicized seal of approval.
   Xacogiva's appeal for deposits for its credit cooperative
was based on ambitious plans that "touched a chord in
people's hearts," as a newspaper put it. Company executives
talked of solving the city's garbage problem, of building
roads, bridges and schools -- things the government couldn't
afford.
   The centerpiece was to be a 16-kilometer stretch of road
linking a major highway with Duyen Hai, a hardscrabble "new
economic district" on the southern coast. Xacogiva said it
would build the road in three years and recover its outlay
through a highway toll. Officials approved the project,
imagining Duyen Hai, in time, becoming a new port for Ho Chi
Minh City.
   However, as local newspapers reported, Xacogiva -- like
Thanh Huong -- seemed to be spending most of its funds on
fancy cars and a three-story "castle" for Mr. Tuoc. And Mr.
Tuoc, like Mr. Muoi Hai, took to traveling with his advisers,
assistants and agents in a convoy of cars flying the company
flag.
   The newspapers, all of which are state-owned, continued to
expose widespread irregularities and "cheating" by both Thanh
Huong and Xacogiva, but the authorities seemed reluctant to
move against them. As recently as Feb. 25, Saigon Giai Phong,
a daily, said of Mr. Tuoc in a front-page headline, "The Law
Was Clearly Violated. Why Is the Criminal Still at Large?"
   The answer, as Saigon Giai Phong itself suggested, was
that both Xacogiva and Thanh Huong were paying off officials
to keep the law at bay.
   Finally, Mr. Tuoc's nerve snapped. In early March, he and
his followers fled to neighboring Cambodia, taking with them
a huge stash of money. His wife and family and some Xacogiva
executives, however, were caught. Police then arrested Thanh
Huong's Mr. Muoi Hai, along with his wife, brother and close
associates.
   Officials say that Thanh Huong's books show that 140,000
people deposited 114.24 billion Vietnamese dong, or $26.9
million, in the company. Assets, mainly cars, houses, cash
and gold, total less than a quarter of that.
   Newspapers in the city have now gone after the officials
who allegedly shielded Mr. Muoi Hai for so long. They have
named four or five officials and listed the expensive gifts
they got. The papers say it was also common practice for
Thanh Huong to bribe officials by giving them "empty" credit
books so they could collect monthly interest of up to 20% on
large, nonexistent deposits.
   When depositors learned of the collapse of Xacogiva and
Thanh Huong, alarm swept the community. Hundreds of
depositors gathered outside the offices of the Ho Chi Minh
City People's Committee demanding that the authorities do
something about their lost money. Police clashed violently
with Mr. Muoi Hai's bodyguards, who demanded the release of
their boss and tried to force their way into municipal
offices. City authorities appealed on radio and TV for calm
and announced a schedule to partly repay Thanh Huong's
depositors.
   Still, depositors have rushed to get their money back from
other credit cooperatives and private companies, forcing
dozens to close their doors. Some of the biggest are facing
bankruptcy.
   One recent morning, for example, a crowd of worried
investors gathered in the dusty street outside the head
office of Anh Dao, a private concern that employs 800 workers
to make rattan, jute and bamboo products. The city
authorities had posted a notice saying they are trying to
raise money to pay back investors, "so please don't worry."
   No matter how hard he tries, Do Hung Phi, 35, a farmer
from Long An province, does worry. He poured 10 years of
savings into Anh Dao. For six months, the company paid him
10% a month, but the interest payments stopped in April. "I
thought I could get money to take care of my elderly
parents," says Mr. Phi. He says he returns by motorbike every
few days in search of news.
   Inside, Huynh La, 45, the blind owner of Anh Dao, admits
that the company is in deep trouble. "We're bearing the
consequences" of the panic spawned by the collapse of Thanh
Huong and Xacogiva, he says. "We haven't violated the law,
and we haven't cheated people."
   Mr. La says Anh Dao, which continues to operate, has
started repaying depositors, and it is seeking a loan from
the State Bank to complete the repayment.
   In Hanoi, State Bank officials say they are preparing
capital-adequacy and other regulations that will ensure
credit cooperatives are closely monitored in the future. The
officials say they intend to review the activities of credit
cooperatives and close weaker ones, though they concede that
nobody even knows how many exist throughout the country.
   Mr. Oanh, the economic adviser, who estimates that credit
cooperatives have attracted total deposits of 400 billion
dong or more, criticizes the State Bank for its lack of
action.
   "The State Bank is supposed to be the bank of last resort,
but it isn't acting like one," he says. "They aren't moving
to allow competent credit cooperatives to keep functioning."

   Some Find This a Bit Spaced-Out,
   And It Doesn't Rhyme With June

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- In a bid for immortality, a
California company is shooting for the moon.
   Avcom Systems Inc., a closely held maker of
geographical-information systems, is lobbying with the
International Astronomical Union to have the Earth's moon
named Avcom.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It seems to fit," says the company's chairman, Brad
Bishop. "Avcom doesn't mean anything." He got the idea after
his children asked him the moon's name. "I thought it must
have some Greek name or something. But when I found out it
didn't, I thought, why not name it after our company?"
   Astronomers, however, think Mr. Bishop is a bit
starry-eyed. "I don't think there's any chance," says Ray
Batson, chief of the planetary-cartography section for the
U.S. Geological Survey. Commercial, religious and political
names are typically shunned to avoid controversy. Anyway,
"most of us feel `the Moon' is a perfectly acceptable name,"
he says.
   The satellites of other planets have names, but often with
a unifying theme. Uranus's moons, for example, are named for
characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope's "Rape of the
Lock." Features on Mercury are named for artists and
musicians, while Venus's are named for goddesses and female
explorers.
   The public can submit names, which are chosen by a board
of international astronomers. An English girl, for instance,
submitted the name for Pluto. After the Challenger disaster,
many Americans lobbied for newly discovered moons of Uranus
to be named after the shuttle crew. (Instead, craters on the
moon were named after the victims.)
   It's considered poor form for astronomers to name
discoveries after themselves, as etiquette requires them to
wait for a colleague to honor them. And some suggestions are
simply inappropriate, says Brian Marsden, of the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory. A one-time head of the Soviet
secret police was denied a place in the heavens because "he
did in a lot of people."
   It may be easier with asteroids, which are being
discovered faster than they're being named (4,461 have been
identified, though 1,000 remain nameless). Brahms, Beethoven
and Bach are all asteroids, as is Karl Marx. Last month, four
new asteroids were named after the Beatles, and another was
christened Eric Clapton.

ended April 30.
   The company last paid a quarterly dividend of six cents a
share on May 4. The holding company for Boston Five Cents
Savings Bank said it would suspend its dividend "until
earnings get back on track."

   Boston Five said it expects to make a provision for
possible loan losses of $3.5 million to $4 million for the
second quarter due to an "assessment of the New England real
estate market." Results for the quarter will be released the
week of May 21, the company said.
   In the quarter ended April 30, 1989, the company earned
$2.9 million, or 41 cents a share.
   Separately, Somerset Bankshares Inc., based in Somerville,
Mass., said it suspended its quarterly dividend of seven
cents a share because of its increase in nonperforming loans
and uncertainty about the Massachusetts economy.

   BUENA PARK, Calif. -- Four years ago, the nation's oldest
theme park, Knott's Berry Farm, experimented with change.
   Instead of sticking with the set menu at the park's
Chicken Dinner Restaurant, diners could substitute soup for
the cherry rhubarb appetizer, and apple or peach pie for the
traditional boysenberry pie.
   Outraged letters came pouring in.
   "People were saying, `How dare you tamper with the
original menu]' and we weren't even taking away any of the
old items" recalls a spokesman.
   Such are the bearable headaches of a company that has
built its reputation on being predictable and familiar. A
fortress in its marketplace, the family-owned enterprise year
after year survives direct competition from Disneyland --
less than 10 miles away -- and from other theme parks run by
big companies. Knott's says its profits are at record levels.
   The secret to Knott's longevity has been preserving its
image of "good, old-fashioned fun," says Chairman Terry E.
Van Gorder. The tricky part has been finding ways to make
this "old-fashioned fun" seem refreshing enough so that
arthritis doesn't set in. And in that, Knott's has apparently
succeeded. "They keep adding new things, but they also keep
the old," says Tom Powell, editor of Amusement Business
magazine, a trade publication.
   In many ways, Knott's is the smorgasbord of theme parks,
with indoor rides like at Disneyland, fast rides for
thrill-seekers, a dolphin show to compete with marine parks
and a playland for kids.
   But the centerpiece remains Knott's 50-year-old Ghost
Town. Here, visitors can hop aboard an 1880s steam train, pan
for "real gold" (tiny granules of the stuff) and watch a
simulated shootout.
   It all developed over time to meet market demands. In the
1920s, Walter Knott and his wife, Cordelia, cultivated
berries here and sold them from a roadside stand. Mrs. Knott
in 1934 began serving fried-chicken dinners for 65 cents
each.
   As the number of patrons grew, Mr. Knott toyed with the
idea of building an attraction to keep customers entertained
while they waited in line. Mr. Knott was fascinated by tales
of the Old West, having grown up with stories of his mother's
trek to California in a covered wagon. In 1940, he began
moving old buildings here from various ghost towns. Thus
began the nation's first theme park, so called because it had
the "theme" of the Old West.
   But in 1955, Knott's suddenly faced a formidable neighbor:
Disneyland. That park boasted not only a steam train and
replica of the Old West but four other themed areas as well.
   Knott's gradually incorporated some Disney-style elements
to keep pace. A ride through a simulated mine with animated
figures was added in 1962. A Mexican-themed area opened in
1969, followed in 1975 by a Roaring '20s area. Although
Disneyland inadvertently helped Knott's by bringing
out-of-towners to the area, Knott's never could match
Disneyland's numbers. Over the years, several other rival
amusement parks opened.
   In 1981, the year Mr. Knott died, the Knott family decided
to turn the reins over to someone with more experience in the
amusement park industry. It hired Mr. Van Gorder, who had
been president and chief executive of nearby Magic Mountain
amusement park for eight years, until it was sold to Six
Flags Corp. in 1979. Mr. Van Gorder's challenge was to
attract new customers. "One thing that scared me was the line
of gray-haired people at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. I
thought, `My God, this market is dying.'"
   The solution was to build a new themed area where yuppies
could bring their offspring. In 1983, Knott's opened Camp
Snoopy, a $10 million area with pint-sized rides for
children, themed around the Peanuts cartoon characters, which
Knott's licensed from Charles Schulz.
   Knott's has spent about $60 million on new projects in the
past seven years. Mr. Van Gorder concedes that the
competition outspends Knott's on capital outlays by
eight-to-one, and on marketing by four-to-one. But, he says,
"the last four years by far have been the most successful in
our history" in terms of sales and profits. Attendance has
remained relatively constant over the past several years.
(Knott's declines to disclose specific figures.)
   Now, Knott's plans to do something its bigger competitors
have already done: duplicate itself, but on a small scale.
   A new $70 million park called Knott's Camp Snoopy will be
located inside the new Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.
Opening in the fall of 1992, it will have 16 rides and
attractions.
   "Given the cost of land these days, this smaller
vest-pocket park solution makes a lot of sense," Mr. Van
Gorder says. He hopes Knott's can find "more small-park
opportunities in America in the years ahead," and maybe even
go overseas.
   Knott's is expanding its food business as well. Later this
month, it will unveil a new line of low-calorie jams and
jellies made with NutraSweet, the first time the sweetener
has been used in fruit spreads. And Knott's says it will open
two restaurants outside the park next year, called Mrs.
Knott's Restaurant &amp; Bakery.
   Will the old-fashioned Knott's formula play outside Orange
County, Calif.? Mr. Van Gorder is confident it will. "Nothing
about us will be out of fashion or out of date," he says. "In
my opinion, America needs to turn back to its roots. Knott's
is already there."

   Economy -- Tracking the Economy:
   April Consumer Prices Expected to Slow
   But Not Enough for 1st-Quarter Damage

   NEW YORK -- Consumer prices for April -- the next test of
inflation's force -- are expected to slow, but not as much as
the recent break in wholesale prices and not enough to make
up for first-quarter damage.
   Besides the consumer price index, due out Wednesday, the
week includes important readings on April industrial output
and capacity utilization; housing starts and permits, plus
the March trade deficit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The April CPI is expected to rise about 0.2%, following
two back-to-back months of 0.5% increases, according to MMS
International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. Last Friday, the
producer price index logged a decline of 0.3%, its third
improved reading in a row.
   But some economists cautioned against celebrating too
soon. "Some of the outrages of the first quarter have come
back to earth. But in an arithmetical sense, it's hard to get
numbers below 5% for the year," said Neal Soss, chief
economist at First Boston Corp. Among the first-quarter
"outrages" -- when the annualized CPI rate jumped to 8.5% --
he cited the leap in apparel prices and other special
seasonal factors.
   Furthermore, in recent months wholesale prices have been
better-behaved than the CPI, which is heavily weighted in the
wage-driven services sector. Economists say this "structural"
inflation -- such as escalating costs linked to wage or
healthcare commitments -- is tougher to tame than inflation
tied to volatile commodities, such as food and oil.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Soss expects to see "slow, grudging
progress" on inflation. Employers, he added, will be "on the
front line, trying to control these health benefit costs that
first show up in inflation, then as profitability pressures."
   Elliot Platt, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
has been forecasting a long-term annual inflation rate of
4.5% since 1988. He still thinks the number is doable over
the next few years. But Mr. Platt, too, noted "the terrible
inflation news we had in the first quarter put us above that"
for now. Besides high apparel prices, he cited a big jump in
the CPI's housing component, which he figures was caused by
technical factors that should begin to work themselves out.
   Edward Campbell, economist with Brown Brothers Harriman &amp;
Co., agrees. In fact, he sees a "high possibility" the April
CPI will be unchanged or even lower. "April is the time we
get more news and less noise" from statistical quirks, he
said. Among the "special circumstances" he thinks will abate
are the big technical jump in March housing costs; increases
in public transportation fares put in place by many cities
early this year, and the recent increase in apparel prices.
   Reports on April industrial output and capacity
utilization, due out tomorrow are expected to bear out the
current belief that the economy is sluggish. Output is
expected to be unchanged or slightly lower following March's
0.7% increase. The operating rate is expected to drop a bit
to 83.1% from March's 83.3%, according to MMS.
   The March trade deficit, due out Thursday, is expected to
widen to around $8 billion following February's surprising
shrinkage to $6.5 billion. But First Boston's Mr. Soss noted
that while "$8 billion is higher, it wasn't that long ago we
were dreaming of getting this low a number."
   The broader deficit is due to a jump in imports as
evidenced by a jump in custom's duties receipts for March,
economists said. Gary Ciminero, chief economist at
Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Providence, R.I., noted that
the customs report found that incoming shipments of Japanese
cars rose more than 10% in March and that petroleum imports
rebounded after a decline in February due to mild weather.
   Housing starts, due out Wednesday, are expected to drop a
bit from March to an annual rate of 1.3 million units,
according to MMS. Economists said housing continues to feel
the impact of higher interest rates, cooler home prices and
tighter lending policies.

   INDIANAPOLIS -- Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said its Eli Lilly Japan
KK unit charged five Japanese companies with patent
infringement, in a lawsuit filed in Tokyo District Court.
   The pharmaceutical concern said the five intend to start
generic operations that would encroach upon the company's
patented cefaclor antibiotic, sold under the name Kefral in
Japan by Lilly licensee Shionogi &amp; Co. Lilly called Kefral
Japan's top-selling pharmaceutical.

   Lilly sells the cefaclor product in the U.S. under the
name Ceclor.
   In an industry where intellectual-property fights are
commonplace, Lilly is considered among the most aggressive in
using litigation to protect its patents.
   Lilly Japan KK's suit names Sakai Yakuhin, Tokyo; Ichikawa
Kagaku Kenkyusho, Osaka; Taiyo Yakuhin Kogyo, Nagoya; MF
Seizei Kenkyusho, Tokyo; and Toyo Shinyaku, Aichi Prefecture.
   Lilly said it has notified several drug concerns, "who are
preparing to launch generic Cefaclor products, of the
effective coverage of our patents." But the five named
companies "are continuing their preparation," Lilly said.
   The suit seeks to have the companies prevented from
"importation/manufacture of bulk Cefaclor or production of
final products."

   For 10 years, Ann Jones believed she was God and thought
she controlled the weather. Diagnosed as schizophrenic, she
was in and out of hospitals 35 times and was put on just
about every anti-psychotic drug available.
   Then, last year, she began taking a drug whose brand name
is Clozaril and, finally, something worked for her. Her
delusions disappeared. She hasn't been inside a mental
hospital since. In the fall, the 37-year-old Ms. Jones plans
to take courses toward a teaching degree. The change in her
life, she says, "is really wonderful."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The drug, known generically as clozapine, is the most
significant advance in anti-psychotic drugs in 20 years, and
it offers hope to at least 200,000 people in the U.S. -- many
of them locked away in mental wards or roaming homeless in
city streets -- for whom conventional treatment has failed.
But few of them are getting the drug or are likely to get it
anytime soon. The reason is money: Clozapine costs $8,944 a
year, and nearly everyone who stands to benefit from it is
poor.
   In many states, mental-health agencies and Medicaid
programs, strapped for cash, can't -- or won't -- pay for
clozapine. Some private insurers are balking at coverage.
Even where money is available for initial treatment,
physicians are reluctant to prescribe the medicine without
assurance that patients will be able to go on taking it.
   "Clozapine is a rich man's drug for a poor man's disease,"
says Larry Lehmann, associate director for psychiatry at the
U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs in Washington.
   The drug spotlights -- much as the costly AIDS drug AZT
has -- the conflicts that arise between companies seeking to
market and profit from new medicines and the welfare of
patients who need them. It raises tough questions about
trade-offs necessary when beneficial treatments also have
potentially devastating side effects. And in the near-term,
at least, it poses an economic challenge to a health care
system already saddled with huge costs. Lawyers around the
country are contemplating legal action to require states to
make clozapine available to those who might benefit. At the
current price, that could cost somebody $2 billion.
   As a consequence, the nation's mental-health system, which
already spends more than $7 billion a year to treat
schizophrenia, has been in an uproar ever since Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals Corp. introduced the drug on Feb. 5. The
company packages the drug along with a mandatory and
expensive blood-monitoring system designed to detect a side
effect that could otherwise be fatal to as many as 2% of
patients. Without its proprietary system, Sandoz says, some
patients will die and the drug will inevitably be pulled from
the market.
   The blood monitoring is the more expensive part of the
package and, because of it, critics say, few will be able to
afford the drug anyway. So state mental-health leaders,
Medicaid officials, pharmacists, members of Congress and the
secretary of veterans affairs have mounted an intense, and
thus far unsuccessful, effort to force Sandoz to uncouple the
drug from the blood-testing program -- or at least itemize
the costs -- and cut the price. The issue is the subject of a
major forum today at a meeting of the American Psychiatric
Association in New York.
   "People are desperate to use this drug," says Mona
Bennett, the deputy commissioner for mental health in
Massachusetts. "We can't not use it." But treating the
state's eligible patients would cost $5 million, "which we
simply do not have."
   Schizophrenia is a mysterious, little-understood mental
disorder that typically strikes people in their late teens
and early 20s. It affects about 1% of the population, or
about 2.5 million Americans. On any given day, schizophrenics
occupy 25% of the nation's hospital beds, according to a
study by John Talbott, a psychiatrist at the University of
Maryland.
   Its victims suffer from paranoia, hallucinations and
delusions -- they hear voices, converse with telephone poles,
send brain waves through televisions and radios and believe
secret agents, presidents or aliens are out to kill them.
Psychiatrists call these the "positive" symptoms. The
"negative" symptoms include apathy, lack of motivation and
physical and emotional withdrawal.
   About 25% of schizophrenics suffer only infrequent
psychotic episodes, and another 50% can be treated adequately
with such drugs as Thorazine, Haldol, Mellaril and Prolixin.
These medicines, however, usually don't alleviate the
negative symptoms that rob schizophrenics of their ambition,
and they cause nasty side effects -- stiffness and
restlessness in more than 60% of patients, and more severe
twitching and involuntary body movements called tardive
dyskinesia -- in about 20% of patients.
   The remaining 20% to 25% -- perhaps as many as 500,000
people -- don't respond to any conventional medication, or
develop side effects so severe that they can't take the
drugs. Considered "treatment resistant," they live lives that
amount to "a roller-coaster ride through hell," as one
patient describes it.
   The trip sometimes starts in private institutions, where
costs can amount to $200,000 a year or more and can thus
quickly deplete insurance benefits and family resources.
Unable to hold even menial jobs, patients often end up on
public assistance. Many are either confined in state mental
hospitals or admitted so frequently that the wards become a
second home. As many as 20% attempt suicide.
   Sandoz is the U.S. subsidiary of Sandoz Ltd., the Swiss
drug giant, which first developed clozapine in 1961 and
introduced it in Europe 10 years later. The drug sparked a
great deal of interest in the U.S. in 1988, when Herbert
Meltzer, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, John Kane of Long Island (N.Y.) Jewish Hospital,
and other researchers published a study showing that the drug
worked far better than traditional treatments for many
hard-to-treat schizophrenics -- and essentially without
debilitating side effects.
   For the first time, a drug relieved the negative symptoms
of schizophrenia, giving patients back their interest in the
world around them. Many have been able to live independently
and hold jobs. "They come out of the woodwork," says Dr.
Meltzer. "They want to experience pleasure. That is one of
the key advantages to this drug. It's definitely a medical
breakthrough."
   But it isn't a cure. At least 40% of the targeted patients
don't respond or can't take it; for the lucky 30% to 60%,
levels of improvement vary widely. The drug must be taken
indefinitely. And nearly all patients need intensive
psychotherapy and social and vocational rehabilitation if
they are to re-enter society. "One patient compared herself
to Rip van Winkle," Dr. Meltzer says.
   The drug's biggest drawback is that it can kill people.
Sandoz learned that the hard way in 1975, when several
patients in Finland died, victims of virulent infections that
developed after clozapine induced agranulocytosis, a
condition that blunts the body's ability to produce
infection-fighting white blood cells. Sandoz yanked the drug
from the market temporarily. Clinical trials in the U.S. were
canceled.
   In the mid-1980s, the FDA agreed to reconsider clozapine.
And, on the basis of the "amazing" results of the 1988 study,
says Paul Leber, director of the agency's
neuropharmacological drug division, the FDA took steps to
approve it despite the danger. Through the mid-1980s, Sandoz
says, 43 patients died among 112 who developed
agranulocytosis world-wide. (More recently in the U.S., 18 of
1,800 users developed the condition, but it was successfully
reversed in each case when patients were taken off the drug.)
   "Everyone involved understood that there would probably be
deaths," Dr. Leber says. "The question was, is the bang big
enough to make it worth this kind of risk. The {FDA's expert
advisers were} fairly convinced that this was a dramatic
thing."
   The agency was even more enthusiastic when Sandoz decided
that the drug would be dispensed only in concert with a
monitoring system. In approving the drug last October, the
FDA says it didn't designate a specific approach, but to
Sandoz, there is only one -- its own Clozaril Patient
Management System -- and that is at the heart of the furor.
   The company negotiated exclusive contracts with Baxter
International Inc.'s Caremark home-care division to take
weekly blood samples from each patient and to dispense the
drug, and with Roche Biomedical Laboratories Inc., a
subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., to analyze the blood
for white cells. No other company, agency or hospital can
deliver the medicine, and each patient has to submit to a
blood test each week. "The motto is: `No blood, no drug,'"
says a Caremark employee.
   The price -- no matter how much of it the patient is
taking or where in the U.S. he lives -- is the same
nationwide: $172 a week, $8,944 a year. At that price, annual
revenue could ultimately reach at least $600 million.
Sandoz's annual U.S. pharmaceutical sales currently total
$750 million.
   Sandoz says the drug will eventually save states thousands
of dollars per patient over the $66,000 it costs on average
to treat hospitalized schizophrenics for a year. But states
maintain that any savings are long-term at best. Vacated beds
will be filled with other patients. "To save money, we have
to close a wing," one official said. And patients on
clozapine will need new therapy, housing and rehabilitation,
all of which cost money too.
   "This is the most expensive treatment we've encountered,"
says Dr. Stephen Shon, medical director of California's
mental-health department. "We don't have any history with a
drug that has a whole laboratory attached to it," adds
Norwood Knight-Richardson, assistant director of the state
psychiatric institute in Alaska, where winter storms are a
daunting problem for home-care teams heading to remote
villages to draw blood and dispense clozapine.
   In Oklahoma, the cost of treating eligible patients would
exceed the state's total mental-health budget. Texas, which
ranks 48th among the 50 states in per-capita spending for the
mentally ill, would have to budget almost $100 million a
year. For California, it could be $300 million. In South
Dakota, despite Sandoz's one-price-fits-all policy, officials
say they are contending with Caremark over transportation
costs to reach patients in remote areas.
   Critics charge that there is more marketing than medicine
in the "system," that it is a clever ploy that helped speed
regulatory approval and that will camouflage hefty profit in
a package price -- before the company's exclusive right to
market the drug runs out in 1994. While they agree that blood
monitoring is necessary, they maintain the Sandoz system is
unnecessary and much too expensive. Doctors and hospitals
routinely monitor patients on other medicines -- including
AZT and some cancer drugs -- at least as life-threatening as
clozapine. The VA's Dr. Lehmann says his agency can do the
blood work for $1.86. Doctors and pharmacists also say the
system pre-empts their clinical judgment.
   Moreover, Sandoz sells the same drug in Europe at prices
as low as $20 to $32 a week, according to several reports,
and without requiring the same blood-monitoring frequency.
"We think we're getting the short end," says Tom Ahrens,
senior consulting pharmacist for Medi-Cal, California's
Medicaid program. "The whole country is."
   Sandoz has rebuffed all efforts to negotiate. The VA, for
instance, proposed its own monitoring system, with a
computerized "lock-out" to prevent the dispensing of the drug
to patients whose blood hasn't been tested. Medi-Cal said it
would pay $117 a week for the package. Sandoz said no to
both. The company has also refused to itemize the costs of
the package, thus confounding insurers, Medicaid programs and
other payers which usually consider medication, home care,
doctor visits and lab fees separately in determining how much
to pay in reimbursement.
   For its part, Sandoz says its aim is to protect patients
and the drug. The different pricing and monitoring in Europe
reflect local regulatory costs, policies and price controls.
Besides that, in the U.S. "we want to and can meet a higher
standard of patient safety," says Gilbert Honigfeld, Sandoz's
director of scientific communications, who has supervised
clinical research on clozapine since 1973.
   But Sandoz stands firm on its U.S. price. The company, Mr.
Honigfeld argues, deserves a fair return on a drug it pursued
despite long odds against marketing approval. "People forget
we're a business," he said, "we're not a charity."
   Sandoz won't sanction other monitoring systems, he added,
because it would be liable for their quality under the
FDA-approved labeling. A strict system is necessary, the
company and some psychiatrists say, because schizophrenic
patients are particularly hard to track, and many state
mental-health programs are already understaffed. Even in
carefully designed clinical trials, some patients
inadvertently went several weeks between blood checks, Mr.
Honigfeld says, which is evidence that no matter how
conscientious a hospital, certain patients will slip through
the cracks.
   "If there were a number of deaths, we would feel compelled
to take Clozaril off the market," Mr. Honigfeld says. "It
would be a tremendous loss for the many other patients who
don't develop this problem."
   Stuck in the crossfire are the patients. Hardly thrilled
with the price, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill,
an advocacy group -- mainly patients' families -- is
reluctant to criticize the company. "I don't know whether the
company has priced this fairly," says Laurie Flynn, executive
director of NAMI. "I just want it to be available." And she
thinks the cost controversy raises another issue.
   "The Medicaid system is willing to spend $50,000 a year on
kidney dialysis," per patient, she says, "but they don't want
to spend $9,000 on schizophrenia. We feel there is a stigma,
that there's a feeling these people aren't worth it."
   Currently, about 4,000 patients are on clozapine,
including 1,500 who began the treatment as clinical research
subjects. Sandoz is continuing to carry the research patients
"while the states are getting their act together," Mr.
Honigfeld says. So far, about 15 state Medicaid programs pay
for the drug, and 23 mental-health agencies have earmarked
funds for it.
   Sandoz projects its first-year sales at 8,000 to 10,000
patients. While the total market ultimately depends on how
much those who pay the bills can afford, Mr. Honigfeld sees
it topping out at about 70,000.
   Some students of the subject think that estimate is too
low. Dr. Meltzer, a champion of the drug who supports
Sandoz's view of the controversy, says that at least 300,000
people in the U.S could benefit from it. "I would hope that
if it gets scaled up, the price could come down," he says.
   As the first of a new class of drugs, clozapine may lead
to better drugs without such potentially dire side effects --
or expensive monitoring systems. Scientists and major drug
firms already are working with sister compounds that look
promising. But products are at least three to five years from
the marketplace.
   For now, the stand-off has created questions so vexing
that some doctors think it is unethical to treat impoverished
patients with clozapine. For instance, New York state has
budgeted $2 million of mental health funds for clozapine,
mostly for patients confined to hospitals. Those who get well
enough to leave the hospital would look to Medicaid for
coverage. But so far, it won't pay. Even if it did, patients
who find jobs could quickly earn enough money to lose their
Medicaid eligibility -- and then not be able to afford to buy
the drug that keeps them well enough to work. Says John
Oldham, chief medical officer for New York's mental-health
agency: "The result you want from this drug puts you in a
tremendous dilemma."

   These days, a sentence to death is more like a sentence to
a decade on death row. The average capital case takes 106
months from crime to execution, a committee headed by former
Justice William Lewis F. Powell Jr. reported in a study
issued last September.
   The investigation of the crime, the trial and sentencing,
the direct appeal to the highest court in the state followed
by a bid for U.S. Supreme Court review -- all this accounts
for only 48 of the 106 months. Most of the remaining time
goes to fashioning, presenting and litigating petitions for
habeas corpus.

<TEXT>
   Inmates in state prisons can file their petitions in both
state and federal court. But state courts tend to give the
petitions short shrift, especially second and third petitions
after the first has been denied. The major delaying factor in
death cases, accounting for more than 80% of the average time
capital inmates spend on habeas corpus, is the federal writ.
There are no time deadlines for habeas corpus. The typical
"deadline" in capital cases is a looming execution date,
which usually sets off a new round of writs.
   This ability to spend years in the federal court system
long after a conviction has become final is a bonanza of the
Earl Warren era. In 1963, the Supreme Court handed down two
important rulings that opened the floodgates for writ
petitions from state prisoners. The first relaxed a
once-ironclad rule that required them to exhaust state-court
remedies first. The second allowed prisoners to raise
constitutional issues piecemeal over a series of writs,
trying out some issues in the first writ, others later. The
only bar is "abuse of the writ," deliberately holding back a
claim in order to manipulate the legal system.
   Few death row prisoners are executed these days without
having made at least two trips to the Supreme Court on
federal habeas corpus writs. Few prisoners are executed,
period. Since 1976, when the Supreme Court reapproved the
death penalty in a Georgia case, there have been only 124
executions. Most of the rest of the total U.S. death row
population of more than 2,327 is in court. In Georgia,
prosecutors and defense lawyers are still litigating
execution cases dating from 1974, when its new death law went
into effect.
   This has led to calls for reform in the federal habeas
system. Next week the Senate is scheduled to hear two
separate and competing reform packages by Senate Judiciary
Chairman Joseph Biden and ranking Republican Strom Thurmond.
Both packages would set time deadlines -- strict in the
Thurmond bill, less so in the Biden bill -- for filing writ
petitions. In the House, the Judiciary Committee's courts
subcommittee plans to start hearings Wednesday on habeas
corpus.
   But congressional reforms may not be necessary. In fact,
if Congress passes the Biden bill, the effect may well be to
sabotage the gradual course of federal habeas corpus reform
that the Supreme Court has undertaken on its own starting
when Warren Burger replaced Earl Warren, and accelerating
since William Rehnquist succeeded Mr. Burger.
   The court has removed entire congeries of legal issues,
such as those pertaining to the legality of state search
warrants from federal habeas corpus purview. In a doctrine
called "procedural default," the justices have refused to let
federal courts review questions that the defendant's lawyers
did not raise properly at earlier stages in the proceedings.
   In February 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a sleeper
decision, Teague v. Lane, holding that state prisoners could
not use federal habeas corpus as a vehicle for making new
constitutional law unless the proposed new rule (with some
exceptions), pertained to "bedrock" constitutional rights,
presumably on the order of the right to counsel. The ruling
effectively told state inmates to raise such claims in state
court on direct appeal or forget about them.
   On March 5 of this year, the justices issued two more
rulings extending Teague v. Lane to capital cases. Two other
death cases with Teague issues were argued in February and
April and are awaiting decision.
   The seemingly endless case of Robert Alton Harris, set for
argument Monday before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
is a case study in the way the current open-ended
post-conviction review system works in capital cases. Mr.
Harris was tried and sentenced to death in 1979 for the
murder of two teen-age boys at Miramar Lake near San Diego in
July 1978. In 1981, the California Supreme Court affirmed his
conviction and sentence -- one of only four such affirmations
during the tenure of liberal Chief Justice Rose Bird.
   The gruesome details of the murders and of Mr. Harris's
criminal career in general -- the eight shots he plugged into
the boys before finishing off the hamburgers they had been
eating, the fact that he was already on parole for beating a
neighbor to death and trying to set him afire, the forcible
sodomy he committed on a fellow inmate while awaiting trial
-- can be read in the California high court's 1981 opinion.
Suffice it to say that Mr. Harris's wife testified for the
prosecution at his sentencing hearing.
   During the 11 years since his conviction, Mr. Harris and
his lawyers have filed seven petitions for habeas corpus,
four in state court, three in federal court. Over the years
he has alleged: that his sentence was out of proportion to
his crimes; that the trial judge refused to give a
"diminished capacity" instruction to the jury based on Mr.
Harris's smoking two joints of marijuana before the murders;
that, although Mr. Harris is white, he was the victim of a
racially discriminatory capital sentencing system in
California. He won some court victories that higher courts
later reversed. By the end of last year, it seemed he had
exhausted all possible avenues of legal relief. An April 3
execution date was set. He was to be the first criminal to go
to the gas chamber in California since 1967.
   Just a week before Mr. Harris's scheduled execution date,
his attorneys filed the seventh and latest petition, winning
a stay of execution. The grounds for the newest writ? Two
court-appointed psychiatrists who examined Mr. Harris before
the sentencing hearing failed to discern any signs of organic
brain damage. His lawyers now say that Mr. Harris was a
victim of fetal alcohol syndrome, hyperactivity and other
brain disorders.
   In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a defendant
facing a death sentence has a right of access to the services
of a "competent" court-appointed psychiatrist. So why didn't
Mr. Harris raise this ground in 1985 or earlier rather than
on the eve of his execution in 1990? "We've been trying to
get the court to pay for an EEG since 1982, but the court
refused," is the response of Mr. Harris's lead lawyer,
Charles Sevilla. "Finally last year, we paid for one
ourselves."
   The issue of Mr. Harris's mental state now and in 1978 is
murky. He raised an alibi defense at trial and a marijuana
intoxication defense sometime later in the writ process. An
electroencephalogram administered to him before the 1979
sentencing hearing yielded normal results, although a 1971
EEG had shown abnormalities a probation officer attributed to
chronic glue-sniffing. At any rate, the murders, which
occurred so Mr. Harris and his brother could obtain a getaway
car for a bank robbery they had planned and rehearsed for
weeks, did not exactly bespeak a disordered brain.
   The Harris case has all the earmarks of a candidate for
quick termination under Teague v. Lane: an attempt to
establish a new rule of law via federal habeas corpus long
after the time for direct appeal has expired. That is where
the Biden bill would come into play. While setting a one-year
time limit at the end of direct appeal (subject to numerous
exceptions) for getting all federal habeas claims on file, it
also contains language that effectively overrides both Teague
v. Lane and the procedural default rule the Supreme Court set
earlier. The Biden bill is to the Supreme Court's recent
habeas corpus decisions what the pending Kennedy-Hawkins
civil rights bill is to its affirmative action rulings.
   Fortunately for prosecutors, the Biden bill has little
chance of passing, mostly because of a controversial
amendment by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) that would
effectively bring racial quotas to state death penalty laws
by allowing statistical challenges to them. (The tougher
Thurmond bill is also said to have little future.) This may
be all for the best, for the Supreme Court seems to be moving
efficiently on its own toward putting an end to open-ended
death appeals.

   NEW YORK -- Every industry has its Holy Grail. For the
cellular-telephone business, it's digital technology, which
promises to reduce crowding on the airwaves, cut costs and
spur growth.
   Cellular phones have become victims of their own
popularity: No longer merely toys of stockbrokers and movie
moguls, they are now so abundant that they are straining the
capacity of current networks. Cellular callers in Los Angeles
and New York must sometimes wait several minutes for a dial
tone.

   "There are certain downtown areas or heavily traveled
highways where usage is so high at, say, rush hour that calls
just get blocked," says Gregory Vogt, chief of the Federal
Communications Commission's Mobile Services Bureau.
   Cellular operators also face the prospect of a new
competitor: so-called personal communications networks. These
systems, suited more to office than car use, would use
smaller and less costly phones and equipment to transmit
calls in a higher frequency range than cellular phones. The
FCC just last week approved a test of these networks, though
results won't be known for a couple of years.
   Cellular operators are counting on digital networks, which
soon will begin boosting their capacity, to open the door for
the industry to meet these challenges and continue its rapid
growth. Digital systems being installed in Los Angeles (by
Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., a joint venture of LIN
Broadcasting Inc. and BellSouth Corp., and by Pacific Telesis
Group's PacTel Cellular unit) and in New York (by Nynex
Corp.'s Nynex Mobile Communications unit and by Metro One,
owned by LIN and Metromedia Inc.) are expected to begin
operating early next year, and the rest of the country may
get the technology within five years.
   Digital networks, which will be compatible with existing
analog cellular phones, initially "will give us a threefold
increase in the number of calls we can handle over the
current radio spectrum," says Terry S. Parker, president of
GTE Corp.'s mobilephone business. Within a few years, digital
systems are expected to have six to seven times the capacity
of today's equipment.
   Existing cellular systems are actually hybrids of digital
and analog technology. When a call goes out over the current
cellular network from a car or briefcase phone, the
electrical pattern of a voice is transmitted in the form of
continuous radio waves, picked up by and passed among many
radio transceivers called cell sites. This traffic is
coordinated by digital switches that are wired to both the
cell sites and the regular phone network.
   Fully digital systems, in contrast, will transmit voices
in the form of a series of pulses, representing the zeros and
ones of computer language. This technology enables a cellular
system to fit more voice conversations on a single channel.
   The current system proved adequate for many years, but in
many areas it isn't anymore. The number of cellular
subscribers reached 3.5 million last year, nearly triple the
level of two years earlier. Clifford A. Bean, a mobile-phone
analyst at Arthur D. Little Inc., Cambridge, Mass., expects
the number to nearly triple again to 10 million by 1993, and
to exceed 20 million by the year 2000.
   Digital network equipment will cost about $500 per
subscriber to install, or about half the cost of analog
systems, according to Alf Humphries, telecommunications
analyst at Hanifen Imhoff Inc., an investment-banking firm in
Denver. That means a company such as PacTel Mobile, which now
has about 413,000 subscribers, would need to spend about $200
million to service its current customers on the new
equipment, he says.
   At the same time, digital systems are expected to reduce
operating costs. Their greater capacity and superior built-in
diagnostic capabilities should lower costs on a per-channel
basis by 10% to 25%, says Piyush Sodha, director of cellular
product line management for Northern Telecom Ltd.'s U.S.
subsidiary.
   The increased capacity and efficiency of digital systems
will stimulate customer demand and push prices down, says
John A. Berrigan, a vice president and cellular industry
consultant at Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. Cellular subscribers
now pay an average of about $100 a month for service, and Mr.
Berrigan estimates that digital technology should cut the
monthly bill by 25% or more within five years as traffic
increases on the new networks.
   "Pricing has been kept high by the carriers as one of the
methods for handling demand in highly populated areas," Mr.
Berrigan says. With digital, he adds, carriers will be able
to "broaden their base of customers" from affluent
professionals to more middle-income customers. It isn't clear
how digital technology will affect cellular companies'
revenues as prices fall.
   Digital technology may feed growth in other ways. It
should significantly boost data transmission speeds, moving
the so-called portable office closer to reality. Now,
cellular customers using a portable fax machine or laptop
computer from a car or train must struggle with snail'-space
transmission.
   Andrew Czernek, vice president of marketing at Zenith Data
Systems, a Groupe Bull company, says digital networks would
allow cellular data transmissions to at least match the
regular phone network in speed. Would this help Zenith sell
more laptop computers? "Did creation of the interstate
highway system help Ford sell more cars?" asks Mr. Czernek.
"I would expect dramatic 30% to 100% -- type increases (in
unit sales), not 5% to 10%."
   General Motors Corp. is looking at whether digital
technology can be used to monitor engine-maintenance
computers in its cars. Digital cellular communications could
also become the basis for a two-way highway communications
system under study by the Transportation Department that
would offer route guidance and traffic-flow information to
motorists.
   The new technology is expected to tighten security for
cellular calls. "Communications will be more private than
with current analog systems, which you could listen in on
with a scanner," Mr. Bean says. "Digital communication is
inherently scrambled" since, to an outside computer,
transmissions -- including digital voice traffic -- appear as
a jumble of ones and zeros.
   Still, the transition to digital will require some
sacrifice. For one thing, new customers will have to use
hybrid phones that let the caller switch between analog and
digital transmission, depending on location. At least
initially, the new phones probably will be more expensive
than their analog counterparts. They also will be bigger,
with bigger batteries -- interrupting an industry trend
toward smaller phones.
   "The new units will deliver an audio quality as good as
analog (and) will be bigger, and the (power pack) in the
trunk of the car will be bigger, "says James P. Caile,
director of marketing at Motorola Inc.'s Cellular Group,
which markets the pocket-sized MicroTac, the industry's
smallest phone and an analog unit.
   Cellular phones could eventually face a challenge from
other forms of radio communications vying to become the basis
for personal communications networks, or PCNs, of the future.
With these systems, customers would use pocket phones like
Captain Kirk's on "Star Trek."
   Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant, says it is
testing such a system in Australia, using "microcells" that
wouldn't have to be as sophisticated as regular cellular
equipment. That's because they wouldn't be used for vehicles
speeding down the highway, but rather for use by pedestrians
and office workers.
   The FCC is intrigued by PCNs. It recently licensed a
subsidiary of U.K. cellular operator Millicom Inc. to
construct and operate experimental PCNs in Houston and
Orlando, Fla. Millicom, along with partners British
Aerospace, Matra of France and Pacific Telesis, are already
licensed to test a PCN in Britain by 1992, and if successful
will spend more than $1 billion to build a permanent network.
   Millicom so far hasn't demonstrated that its system will
work. Indeed, Chairman J. Shelby Bryan acknowledges that a
PCN device in a photo that the company widely distributed to
the media is just a plastic shell minus electronic
components.
   "We haven't demonstrated it," Mr. Bryan says, "But the
technology definitely works." He adds that a PCN lab
experiment in Britain worked, but he wouldn't identify any
independent observers of these lab tests.
   Millicom's network would use thousands of
water-cooler-sized radio systems strategically placed in city
neighorhoods and office buildings to transmit and receive
calls. The little-used high-frequency portion of the radio
spectrum should allow for much smaller phones, requiring
batteries that are approximately one-fifth the size of
portable cellular phone batteries.
   Another system, called CT2, seems more of a long shot. A
British development, CT2 works much like a cordless phone in
the home and could even displace pay phone usage. But so far
most British phone customers have avoided it, primarily
because CT2 users can only place calls; they can't receive
them. And the phones are still expensive -- about $300 each.
   Tom Powers, president of AT&amp;T's Cellular Systems unit,
says, "One of the biggest difficulties (for CT2 operators)
will be making the network service ubiquitous and
inexpensive," a process that will take years. By then,
cellular operators hope to be well established with efficient
-- and profitable -- digital systems.

   WASHINGTON -- Rep. Newt Gingrich, the House Republican
whip and conservative guerrilla warrior, has scheduled the
beginning of the next political revolution for Saturday
morning television.
   The combative Georgia Republican, who has been thrashing
about the political bulrushes in an effort to give new energy
to the conservative movement, is taking his battle against
what he calls "the failed programs of the bureaucratic
welfare state and its permissive values" into America's
living rooms this weekend.

<TEXT>
   The result is the American Opportunity Workshop, an
hour-long program highlighting local efforts to solve
problems ranging from education to employment. Implicit in
Saturday's show, which includes segments with President Bush
and Vice President Quayle, is the notion that the
big-government programs of the past -- read Democratic
programs -- don't work. "This is not a 30-second attack ad,"
Mr. Gingrich says, "but an effort to change the whole
argument."
   In the process, Rep. Gingrich has managed something of a
political coup: He's packaged his effort to mold a GOP
elective block that he thinks has "one chance in three" of
taking control of the House by 1992 into a television
production that he's marketing as nonpartisan and will be
broadcast nationwide on the Family Channel.
   "This is described as a bipartisan show," complains
Michael McCurry, spokesman for the Democratic National
Committee, "but it's more fulminations from Chairman Newt."
   Although some Democrats, including former Attorney General
Griffin Bell, are involved in the effort, the project has a
strong Republican orientation. The television program, for
example, is sponsored by GOPAC, the political-action
committee that works with Republican state and local
candidates. And it will include five live segments, three
featuring GOP congressmen, one from a Republican meeting in
Portland, Maine, and another featuring Paul Weyrich,
president of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative
think tank.
   Mr. Gingrich has been struggling for more than a year to
give new direction to conservatism and in recent months has
been talking about such ideas as fighting narcotics by
imposing a 10% income penalty for drug use and attacking the
cost of health care by giving tax credits to healthy
Americans and underwriting routine physical examinations. He
has selected third-grade classes in five Georgia public
schools and promised to pay these pupils $2 for every book
they read this summer.
   Rep. Gingrich, who emerged on the national scene as one of
the new anti-welfare-state conservatives, increasingly is
embracing ways to use government efficiently. His view, in
short: The enemy is bureaucracy, not government. "I'm for a
very active government," he says, "not for an active
bureaucracy."
   Mr. Gingrich's brainstorming is being attacked both from
the right and the left.
   "There are times when an efficient government can be worse
than an active, inefficient government," says Doug Bandow, a
senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank
in the capital. "Nobody ever thought that when they were
creating those big government programs they were also
creating a big bureaucracy that would screw everything up.
They thought they had wonderful initiatives that were helping
America."
   Democrats, meanwhile, wonder aloud whether Mr. Gingrich is
well positioned to undertake an assault on Washington's
bureaucracy. "The Republicans have had the White House for
the better part of 30 years, and they've had plenty of chance
to fight the bureaucracy," says Rep. Byron Dorgan of North
Dakota. "The most spectacular waste, fraud and abuse occurred
because they weren't willing to watch carefully enough. The
American people would like to watch good government rather
than a television show."
   The focus of Mr. Gingrich's new offensive is to create a
new political coalition by emphasizing action on the local
level.
   "If we can get people to think about tackling problems at
the local level without running to the statehouse or their
congressman, we can have great success," says Hal Eberle,
executive vice president of the South Carolina Policy
Council, a conservative think tank. "There's a lot of talk
now that Washington is irrelevant, and I think that's great.
Let's dismantle Washington."
   Saturday's television broadcast will focus on individual
efforts such as those undertaken by Polly Williams, the
Democratic state legislator from Milwaukee who fought for
education vouchers for the poor; Luis Garcia, a Southern
Californian who built his construction business with workers
from the barrios; Perry Grogan, a Georgia sheriff who built a
prison at half the expected cost; Douglas Sukeforth, a Maine
machine-products manufacturer who invented a new
refrigeration technology that is an alternative to harmful
refrigerants currently in use; and Chuck Schuntag of
Davenport, Iowa, who created a clearinghouse to help Vietnam
veterans find their companions from the war.
   Local experimentation such as this, Mr. Gingrich says,
"could become the dominant answer for the next 25 years."
   The Gingrich approach calls for local solutions that fall
within a triangle of principles: entrepreneurial free
enterprise, technological progress and what he calls "basic
American values." Some conservatives believe this approach
may rekindle citizen interest in public affairs.
   "I find a lot of frustrated individuals out there," says
GOP state Rep. Robert Ouelette of New Hampshire. "The only
way they can have their voice heard is to protest in front of
city hall or write a letter. This is a way to get people
involved in a movement that can give them impact and power.
This may turn out to be the way to bring the `fundamental
values' people into politics."
   The television broadcast is being accompanied by an
estimated 560 workshops scattered about the country, where
voters will be encouraged to offer local ideas that the
event's planners predict "will define the citizens'
opportunities movement of the 1990s."
   "This is part of the process of thinking through how to
build the next phase of the conservative movement," says
Jeffrey Eisenach, a consultant to GOPAC. "We knew that the
new movement would have to spring from the grass roots up. We
think the way to do this may be to use television. You're
real if you're on the box and you're not real if you're not
on the box."

   The Outlook:
   De-Diversification:
   Aid to Productivity

TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- In the quarter century after World War II,
U.S. corporations were eager to grow, and grow fast. The
logical way to do that would have been to expand within their
own industries, through mergers, acquisitions or otherwise.
But tight antitrust enforcement was limiting mergers within
industries. In addition, many companies thought they saw
better profit opportunities outside their own bailiwicks.
   So companies decided to diversify. If a corporation
operated in a dozen industries, it might be big but it hardly
was monopolizing anything. Businessmen began to believe that
"management" was a discrete talent that could be applied to
almost anything.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Disillusionment soon began setting in, however.
Diversification now is going out of style, and the takeover
binge of recent years has accelerated the process. One
beneficiary, a new study suggests, has been U.S.
productivity.
   It took a while for the bloom to leave the rose. Mergers
and acquisitions, as recorded by Moody's and Standard &amp;
Poor's, reached a peak of 2,407 in 1968. The market continued
active into the early 1970s, but in 1975 there were only 439
transactions. Through most of this period, close to half of
all transactions involved conglomerates, collections of
largely unrelated businesses.
                                                                                                       

   But corporate executives gradually were recognizing that
they had overestimated their management skills. Just because
a company was a whiz in the steel business didn't
automatically mean it could do wonders in chemicals. Many
acquisitions weren't nearly as profitable as companies had
expected, so the merger mania of the late 1960s and early
1970s was followed by an unprecedented wave of divestitures.
                                                                                                       

   In 1965, according to one economist, there had been one
divestiture for each 11 mergers and acquisitions. From 1974
to 1977, there was one divestiture for each two mergers and
acquisitions.
   But it took more time to de-diversify than it had to
diversify. One company's divestiture became another company's
acquisition and, with diversification sinking in popularity,
new marriages often were hard to arrange. Managements dragged
their feet, hating to admit mistakes or hoping they
eventually could make diversity work. To top things off,
interest rates soared in the late 1970s, making new deals
harder to plan and finance.
   In 1980 there were still a lot of diversified companies,
and many of them had problems. In a National Bureau of
Economic Research working paper, Frank R. Lichtenberg
presented results of a study based on 17,000 plants in 1980.
He found that the greater the number of industries in which
the parent firm operated, the lower the productivity, and
thus the profitability, of the plants.
                                                                                                       

   So companies still had business reasons to pare away
unrelated activities. New reasons appeared. The Reagan
administration relaxed antitrust enforcement, making it
easier for corporations to expand within their main lines of
business. Junk bonds helped to provide capital for takeover
artists. The takeover targets often were companies whose book
value exceeded their market value; this gave companies an
incentive to dump less-profitable activities.
                                                                                                       

   By the 1980s the market usually was regarding
diversification as a mistake, whether it was or not. The
stocks of many firms were selling at "conglomerate discounts"
because investors knew, or thought they knew, that companies
found it difficult to manage unrelated activities. Getting
rid of the discounts, and thus reducing takeover
vulnerability, meant getting rid of the unrelated
subsidiaries.
   When takeovers occurred anyway, the acquiring companies
often had to raise money to repay the funds borrowed to
finance the acquisitions. One way to do it was to divest the
unprofitable, unrelated subsidiaries. For these assorted
reasons, Mr. Lichtenberg found, the mean number of industries
in which corporations operated declined by 14% between
January 1985 and November 1989.
   New firms that were formed during this period were much
less diversified than those that went out of business.
Continuing firms reduced the number of industries in which
they operated. Diversification was going out of style.
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Lichtenberg believes that the conglomerate merger boom
of the late 1960s and early 1970s may have contributed to the
slowdown in U.S. productivity growth that began at or
slightly after that time. Similarly, he believes that
de-diversification now is bolstering U.S. productivity,
although he concedes that "it is difficult to determine the
magnitude of this contribution."
                                                                                                       

   Productivity clearly can use some help. The Labor
Department last week reported that while manufacturing
productivity rose at a brisk annual rate of 4.1% in the first
quarter, overall business productivity dropped at a 0.5%
rate.
   The way a corporation is organized obviously is only one
factor affecting its productivity. Research and development
may be more important. Major chemical companies, after first
diversifying into totally unrelated businesses, in the 1980s
decided to stay closer to home. They put less emphasis on
commodity chemicals and more on pharmaceuticals and related
new businesses such as biotechnology.
   U.S. corporations have learned a lot in the past quarter
century. Whatever else they do, they're not likely to seek a
magic solution to their problems by deciding to put their
eggs in a lot of baskets.

   Economy:
   Data Make Fed Unlikely to Raise Rates

   April Producer Prices Fell
   0.3%, Retail Sales 0.6%

   WASHINGTON -- Two new government reports, suggesting that
the economy is more sluggish and inflation less intense than
previously thought, should end speculation that the Federal
Reserve is about to push up interest rates this week.
   The new April statistics, showing a drop in prices at the
producer level and a decline in retail sales, come as the
Fed's policy committee prepares for a meeting this week.
While many analysts had thought the Fed might boost rates to
curb inflation, the new figures make it likely the committee
will leave its grip on rates unchanged -- a prospect that
helped produce a rise in bond prices and a surge in stocks
after the reports came out Friday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department reported that producer prices dropped
0.3% in April, following a 0.2% decline the month before.
Analysts say the two-month decline in producer prices should
eventually bring down consumer prices, which galloped upward
at a worrisome 8.5% annual rate in the first quarter of this
year.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell
a steep 0.6% in April, due largely to a continued sharp
decline in automobile sales. Retail sales fell a revised 0.2%
in March.
   The statistics add further confusion to the current
economic picture, which has been characterized by
intermittent signs of sluggish growth and rising prices.
"People keep thinking we have to be doing one or the other,
inflating or going into recession," says Donald Ratajczak,
who heads the economic forecasting project at Georgia State
University. "The truth is, we aren't doing much of either."
   "While we should never draw simply from one month's
numbers, we believe that the upsurge in inflation will abate
as the year progresses and inflation will remain under
control," said Michael Boskin, chairman of the White House
Council of Economic Advisers. "There were many special
factors affecting the consumer price index and producer price
index in the first part of the year, and the inflation rate
in the first quarter overstated the inflation problem."
   "The economy is not resurging and inflation is not
accelerating," said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the
Mortgage Bankers Association.
   The slump in automobile sales heavily affected both of the
latest economic reports. Auto sales plummeted 2.7% in April
from the previous month, the Commerce Department said,
dragging down the overall retail sales number. And efforts to
boost sales by cutting prices caused the Labor Department's
index of passengercar prices to drop 0.3% in April, following
a 0.8% decline in March.
   Excluding automobiles, retail sales were unchanged in the
latest month. Rosalind Wells, who is chief economist for the
National Retail Federation and who monitors retail sales
closely, said that "consumer demand is holding up pretty
well, except for durable, high-ticket items."
   The drop in producer prices largely reflected a recovery
from January's sharp spike in food prices caused by unusually
cold weather. Tomato prices dived 73%, sweet corn prices fell
50% and cabbage prices dropped 36% in the latest month.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, producer
prices in April rose a modest 0.2%, compared with a 0.3%
increase the month before.
   In financial markets, some traders speculated that new
signs of a weak economy and low inflation would lead the Fed
to ease its grip on credit at the meeting this week. But
that's not likely. A number of Fed policy makers have
recently expressed concerns about the inflation trend, and
their views are unlikely to be changed by these two reports.
   "I think it would be premature to conclude that . . . the
Fed is about to ease policy," said Norman Robertson, chief
economist for Mellon Bank. "I think the Fed has shown
commendable caution about shifting policy on the basis of
month-to-month changes in data."
   "We've still got an inflation problem," agrees Mr.
Gramley. "This number just says it's not fundamentally
getting worse."
   Producer prices of intermediate goods, which still require
some processing, rose 0.1% in April after remaining unchanged
in March. Crude-goods prices dropped 3.1% during the month,
reflecting a sharp fall in prices of petroleum as well as
food. Excluding food and energy, prices of crude goods rose a
steep 2.2% in April following a 2% rise in March.
   The drop in retail sales left them at $148.64 billion for
the month. Sales of durable goods, which are intended to last
more than three years and include autos, dropped 1.6% in
April to $53.79 billion. Sales of nondurable goods were
virtually unchanged at $94.85 billion.
   Figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal changes.
Before adjustments, retail sales last month totaled $145.46
billion.
   Meanwhile, meeting in a Virginia mountain resort during
the weekend, leaders of many of the nation's largest
corporations also predicted inflation will slow sharply from
its swift first-quarter pace. Members of the Business
Council, an association of chief executives, said they expect
consumer prices to grow at a 3.3% annual rate in the second
quarter, a big retreat from their 8.1% rate in the first. For
all of 1990, they expect inflation to run about 4.8%.
   The corporate chieftains' projections were based on a
report by the council's advisory group of economists.
Overall, the Business Council says the economy will grow
about 2% this year. None of its 19 economists expects a
recession this year or next.

   The Media and the Murder

   One of the more diverting features in Mad magazine is "Spy
vs. Spy," a comic strip in which two sneaky, beak-faced
characters carry out absurdly spectacular plots against each
other. Whenever one spy seems close to victory, the other
pulls off an outrageous reversal, and the contest begins all
over again. Add that these two tricksters are decked out in
black and white, and "Spy vs. Spy" begins to resemble racial
politics in New York City.
   The same point is made, without humor, by "Seven Days in
Bensonhurst," this week's "Frontline" presentation (airing
tomorrow, May 15, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS; check local
listings). Narrated by Shelby Steele, an associate professor
of English at San Jose State University in California, the
film shows how the murder of a black youth named Yusuf
Hawkins in a predominantly Italian section of Brooklyn in
August became a media circus and a political sideshow.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In many ways, Mr. Steele is the ideal correspondent for
the topic. In his essays (soon to be published by St.
Martin's Press), he painstakingly dissects the stratagems by
which blacks and whites vie for power by asserting their own
group's innocence against the other's guilt. The best thing
about his dissecting blade is that it cuts both ways -- at
those who blame white racism for all the problems of blacks
and at those who pretend that white racism is just a
self-serving figment of black imagination.
   It's an approach well-suited to the Bensonhurst hoopla,
which consisted largely of New Yorkers screaming at TV
cameras about the defenselessness of their own race against
the depredations of the other. Because the victim in this
case was black, it's hardly surprising that the film focuses
on the uses -- and abuses -- to which black victimization can
be put. It begins with the grief of Mr. Hawkins's father,
Moses Stewart, then tells how the media besieged Mr. Stewart,
in part because the murder occurred during a racially charged
mayoral campaign. Then it shows how Mr. Stewart summoned the
aid of an expert.
   Enter the Rev. Al Sharpton, a man who can turn victims
into martyrs even when, as in the Tawana Brawley case, they
weren't victims to start with. The Rev. Sharpton explains
that he led several marches through Bensonhurst after the
murder to "clarify whether it was a racial attack or not."
Yet it seems that his real intention was to get his rotund
self photographed blowing kisses at the angry white mob at
the marches. "My greatest friends," he smiles, and he's not
joking. Without those hysterical whites, he would never be
able to support his publicity habit.
   Meanwhile, back in the East New York of Brooklyn where Mr.
Hawkins lived, we see the politicians -- David Dinkins, Jesse
Jackson, Ed Koch -- taking their star turns before the
camera. Not all of these performances succeed, as former
Mayor Koch realized when his limousine got christened with
hostile bottles. Finally, when civil rights veteran Roy Innis
arrived in Bensonhurst with Morton Downey Jr., the pastor of
St. Dominic's Catholic Church declares: "This is the moment
that Yusuf Hawkins ceased to be an individual . . . because
the ground that was hallowed by his blood became a circus
ground."
   In my opinion, Mr. Downey was merely the last clown in a
parade that began with the Rev. Sharpton. But regardless of
where we draw the line, the film's point comes across loud
and clear: It is all too easy for an event like young Mr.
Hawkins's murder to become, in Mr. Steele's words, "a stage
on which players of both races quickly began to jockey for
position." Before we know it, the legitimate anger of a Moses
Stewart becomes the farcical posturing of an Al Sharpton.
   Now the question is, if Mr. Steele's blade cuts both ways,
how well does it dissect Bensonhurst? Behind the hysteria
that greeted the Rev. Sharpton's marches, was there any
emotion that could be construed as legitimate? Mr. Steele
notes that the rest of white New York scrupulously distanced
itself from the ugly passions of Bensonhurst. But what about
his own reaction? Shortly after some footage of an angry
woman yelling that all the Rev. Sharpton wants is "free
media," Mr. Steele's comment is: "This kind of racism speaks
for itself."
   I disagree. The kind of racism found in places like
Bensonhurst -- and it is undeniably racism -- isn't simply an
offshoot of the native American strain. To explain how
immigrants and the descendants of immigrants could arrive at
such hateful attitudes, Mr. Steele resorts to an old saying
from his boyhood in a black community near Chicago. White
immigrants, he remarks, learn to use the word "nigger" as "a
means to power, a short cut to the American dream."
   Like all old sayings, this sounds plausible enough. But so
does this bit of Italian folk wisdom heard in Brooklyn by
sociologist Jonathan Rieder: "All those whites who beat {the
blacks} and whipped them, are we responsible for it? I didn't
have anything to do with slavery." To this lack of guilt, add
the fact that countless ethnic Brooklynites have seen their
beloved old neighborhoods wrecked by what journalist Joe
Klein calls "the social anarchy that has taken over the black
underclass," and you have a recipe for unapologetic hatred.
   This hatred stymied "Frontline's" attempts to talk with
Bensonhurst residents. As Mr. Steele told me, "The place was
locked down." Yet the producers did tape a lengthy interview
with two former Brooklynites, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Scaduto, who
now live on Long Island. In Mr. Steele's view, "The Scadutos
gave the best explanation of what Bensonhurst is like" -- an
earnest account of the unpleasant and frightening experiences
that caused them to flee a neighborhood that was turning
black.
   Unfortunately, this whole testimony was edited out. Mr.
Steele explained that he and his colleagues felt that the
Scadutos's story was good "background," but not relevant to
the film's focus on "the posturing that filled the power
vacuum created by Hawkins's death." But if the subject is how
street-level tragedy gets transformed into media-level
melodrama, then what could be more relevant than evidence
that murderers and mobs don't represent all of Bensonhurst,
any more than muggers and demagogues represent all of East
New York?
   The Scadutos's testimony is also relevant because it
refutes the pernicious but popular notion that civil
expressions of group antagonism are essentially no different
from crude ones. Too often, on our campuses and elsewhere,
legitimate grievances and honest disagreements are seen as
worse than racial epithets because they are more "subtle."
The result is another vacuum, filled with posturing,
ignorance and hate. How about focusing a "Frontline" on that?

   Hal Riney Agency Seeks to Prove
   It's More Than a One-Man Show

   This is a story about a man and his ad agency. About
sun-dappled streams and rolling hills. About wide-eyed
children and their dogs. And about the commercials the man
narrates in a town called San Francisco, in a country we call
America.
   The man is Hal Riney, and his mellifluous voice is
familiar to millions as the folksy drawl behind commercials
for Alamo rental cars, John Deere tractors, Blue Cross/Blue
Shield, and, before that, for Gallo wine and Perrier. His
style is unquestionably the most distinctive in advertising.
Beautifully photographed, sun-filtered shots of majestic
mountains, breathtaking sunsets and small children waving
American flags. . . Mr. Riney's unmistakable voice in the
background, steeped in Americana and bringing a tear to the
eye even when the subject is farm tools.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Riney's distinct style, though, has become something
of a millstone around his neck. His agency's ads are so
closely associated with him that some of the staffers doing
the work are frustrated, while outsiders constantly question
whether the shop is viable without him. More than a dozen
creative people have left the Hal Riney &amp; Partners' flagship
San Francisco office in just the past six months, a number of
them disillusioned because no matter what they did, Mr. Riney
somehow got the credit. The small Chicago office recently
lost its two top managers.
   "Unquestionably, the perception is that he is the agency,
so {everyone else} gets lost underneath," says Jeff Atlas, a
former senior writer who left with three other Riney
colleagues earlier this year to form Atlas Citron Haligman &amp;
Bedecarre.
   The perception problem is particularly acute now as the
Riney agency looks to the future. Mr. Riney has steadfastly
denied speculation that he wants to sell his shop. But at 57
years old, he soon must prepare either for a sale or for his
retirement, industry executives say. Yet as of now, no Riney
executives are considered likely successors. While a search
is on to hire a senior executive who might be a contender,
none has been found. The search, what's more, is focusing on
account executives, who wouldn't be able to fill Mr. Riney's
shoes as a creative beacon.
   The problem is compounded because, while other agencies
with top-notch creative reputations have built up creative
"stars" -- executives like Phil Dusenberry at BBDO -- Riney
hasn't. Even hard-core advertising junkies would be
hard-pressed to name Riney's top creative people, such as
Gerald Andelin and Paul Mimiaga. That lack of a star system
for anyone but Mr. Riney makes it difficult to cultivate and
keep strong executives in such an ego-driven business.
   "An organizational chart is usually a pyramid shape. With
Riney, there's Hal -- and everyone else," says Mr. Atlas. As
for finding a new senior executive, he adds, "Someone strong
enough to succeed Hal might not want to work under Hal."
   As far as some clients are concerned, the agency may as
well be a one-man show. Scaling back and paving the way for a
Hal Riney agency without Mr. Riney may prove difficult. One
reason Perrier pulled its account earlier this year, for
example, was because Mr. Riney wasn't spending enough
personal time on the account, executives close to Perrier
say. Mr. Riney couldn't be reached for comment.
   The job of proving that Hal Riney the agency is bigger
than Hal Riney the man falls to the agency's various offices.
Last week, top management of Riney's small New York outpost,
which has been struggling to grow, admitted some frustration.
   "The work that's running now, Hal hasn't written. Hal
never met any of the clients we have here until after we won
the business. He hasn't met Carvel yet," said Jim Travis,
president and chief operating officer of both Riney and its
New York office. And yet, added Helayne Spivak, the office's
creative director, "People say if it's Hal's voice, it must
be his work."
   Perhaps just as disconcerting is that prospective clients
often don't realize that Riney churns out other types of ads,
not just the folksy, patriotic kind narrated by Mr. Riney. So
common have Mr. Riney's trademark down-home ads become that,
in advertising circles, he has already become a living
cliche. "I don't think any agency has as narrow a reputation
-- and as broad a range," Ms. Spivak says.
   Ms. Spivak was brought in last fall from Ammirati &amp; Puris
to spruce up the New York office's creative work. She's been
putting her own stamp on ads and says Mr. Riney hasn't
interfered. True, the office's Mutual of New York commercials
are fairly typical Riney fare, minus Mr. Riney's voice. But
most of the office's other commercials -- like an MTV-style
spot for Fuji audiotape featuring odd people and even odder
sound effects -- don't look much like the Riney stereotype.
   Mr. Travis says the office bills about $45 million, and he
hopes to double that by a year from now. Yet after a spurt of
new business activity a few months ago, the office is quiet
now. Constant, so-far inaccurate, press reports speculating
on a sale, a new president or the departure of Mr. Travis --
who insists he isn't going anywhere -- certainly haven't
helped. Neither has news of the many departures in other
offices, although Mr. Travis says more people were hired than
left. And its Chicago presence is in question as it hunts for
a new manager, although Mr. Travis says the office won't be
shut down.
   The speculation isn't likely to end anytime soon. For one
thing, Mr. Riney has apparently considered selling -- or at
least merging -- his agency before. Several years ago, for
instance, he briefly talked about a three-way merger with
Chiat/Day and Ally &amp; Gargano, Mr. Travis confirmed.
   In the meantime, the Riney organization is working
overtime to prove that, with $225 million in billings, Hal
Riney is more than just a man and a voice. After all, Ms.
Spivak says, "people no longer demand to meet J. Walter
Thompson." She adds, "I don't want people saying, there's
Riney work. I want people to say that's great -- who did that
stuff?"

   Teddy Bear Soup
                                                                                                       

   Campbell Soup this summer will introduce Teddy Bear Soup
as part of a big push to woo kids to its soup franchise.
   In introducing the product, Campbell said it has a renewed
commitment to the children's market. "It's the lost
generation," said Bob Bernstock, who heads up Campbell's soup
business. "We haven't really gone after kids."
   Teddy Bear Soup will come in only one variety, a chicken
broth with pasta cut in the shape of teddy bears.
   The introduction of the soup will be supported by
advertising created by Backer Spielvogel Bates, a Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi unit. Ads promoting the product will feature an
animated teddy bear dancing with the Campbell "Kids"
characters.

   SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI: John Sharkey, a top Saatchi executive
in Europe, is leaving the agency, Saatchi insiders said. Mr.
Sharkey, who couldn't be reached, was close to ousted Saatchi
executives Roy Warman and Terry Bannister, who until earlier
this month were joint chief executives of Saatchi's ad
division. Mr. Sharkey spent five years at Saatchi before
quitting in late 1988 to join Blue Arrow PLC as chief
operating officer. Following a management coup there, he
rejoined Saatchi last June as deputy chairman of
international advertising operations.
                                                                                                       

   ADS CANCELED: Boston's WHDH-TV said Procter &amp; Gamble
canceled its ads there after the CBS affiliate broadcast an
ad urging consumers to boycott P&amp;G's Folgers coffee. The ad
was produced by Neighbor to Neighbor, a national organization
that advocates ending U.S. investments in El Salvador and
urges consumers to boycott coffee containing beans grown in
El Salvador. P&amp;G spends about $1 million annually on ads at
the station. A P&amp;G spokesman said the ad attacks P&amp;G and
Folgers, "and that's not the type of ad environment we want
for our ads."
                                                                                                       

   MILLER RESERVE: Miller Brewing this week will introduce
Miller Reserve, an above-premium beer, in four markets,
including Atlanta and Richmond, Va. Miller says Miller
Reserve, a 100%-barley draft beer, will compete with Michelob
and Heineken. The product will be priced higher than its High
Life and Lite brands. Ads for the new product, developed by
Frankenberry, Laughlin &amp; Constable, Milwaukee, will feature
the theme "The perfect grain. The perfect way to brew it."
                                                                                                       

   ACCOUNTS: Ingalls, Quinn &amp; Johnson, Boston, was named
agency for Colombo Inc.'s $4 million refrigerated-products
account. Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor, New York, had
handled the assignment. Ingalls Quinn also picked up a $1
million assignment for a new photo display product from H-B

   Candy Maker Loses
   Bid for Exemption
   From Sugar Quotas

   CHICAGO -- Brach's Candy Co. said the Commerce Department
rejected its request to have the company's Chicago plant
designated a Foreign Trading Zone.
   The refusal by the department's Foreign Trade Zones Board
means that the candy manufacturer -- owned by Switzerland's
Jacobs Suchard AG -- won't be allowed to import sugar at
world prices, but must instead continue to buy the essential
ingredient under import quotas that boost its annual costs by
about $20 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The petition had become a rallying point for critics of
the import quotas, which keep domestic sugar prices high by
restricting foreign imports. Such quotas, they contend,
represent a subsidy for U.S. growers at the expense of U.S.
consumers.
   A successful bid by the candy company for an exemption
might have sparked similar requests for relief by other
companies.
   While it eliminated the last possibility of success for
the Brach's request, the turndown didn't come as a surprise;
late last month, a Commerce Department examiner recommended
that the petition be denied.
   Brach's had threatened that if it didn't get the relief it
sought it might close the aging Chicago plant -- an island of
high-paying, unionized production jobs in the midst of the
city's blighted West Side -- and shift the about 3,400 jobs
to either Mexico or Canada.
   Late Friday, the company said in a release that it is
"disappointed" with the ruling. "At this time, we haven't
determined what our next steps will be regarding the plant,"
Brach's said.
   Had its trade-zone request been approved, Brach's said,
the company would have been allowed to purchase 100,000 tons
of sugar at world prices, currently 10 cents a pound cheaper
than the price in the U.S.
   Brach's has spent heavily on modernization at its
66-year-old Chicago plant, and needs to spend much more. The
company has claimed that the only way to justify the further
investment required to bring the plant up to standard is
through access to the cheaper sugar.
   Suchard paid $730 million in 1987 to acquire Brach's from
American Home Products Corp., but the acquisition has proven
a major disappointment: Brach's, which had pre-tax 1986
income of $75 million, recorded an operating loss of $50
million in 1989.
   The Swiss concern replaced Brach's former management, but
has since repeatedly reshuffled its own Brach's management
team. Analysts say a rapid post-acquisition restructuring,
including changes in its sales operation and what some
industry experts think was an ill-considered streamlining of
Brach's product line, helped giant competitors Mars Inc. and
Hershey Foods Co. take market share away from Brach's.

   Can Chapman Build U.S. Presence for Japan's Nomura?

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)

<LP>
   Three weeks ago in Tokyo, Max C. Chapman Jr., head of the
U.S. operations of giant Nomura Securities Co., asked his
bosses for a Nomura lapel pin that all Japanese employees
wear.
   He was refused. The Japanese informed him the pin was
reserved solely for employees of the Tokyo parent company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The incident illustrates some of the hurdles Mr. Chapman
faces in trying to build Nomura's sleepy U.S. brokerage unit
into a first-rate investment bank.
   Nomura's appointment of the 46-year-old American
investment banker, once the president of Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co., is something of a first. Japanese industrial companies
have put Americans in charge of their U.S. units, but never
before has a major Japanese financial concern handed active
control of its U.S. units to a "gaijin."
   "It's the ultimate experiment in the financial world
today," said Peter Chepucavage, general counsel of Nomura
Securities International Inc., the formal name of the U.S.
operations. "It's an amazing thing. The most Japanese of all
Japanese institutions picked the most American of all the
Americans."
   Though Nomura officials so far talk of Mr. Chapman with
enthusiastic admiration, some people fear his no-nonsense
personality is destined to clash with traditional Japanese
management style. In his first six months as co-chairman of
the U.S. unit, he certainly hasn't acted like someone who
worries much about upsetting the home office.
   "One of the first things I said when I got here was that
meetings will be conducted in English, and if not, I'm not
going to attend," Mr. Chapman said. "We're attempting to
build a permanent American staff here that can interface with
the Japanese, but not to look to those Japanese to be the
movers or the leaders in terms of this market."
   In all this and more, Mr. Chapman's bosses in Tokyo have
backed him. Earlier this month, Nomura's directors voted to
add Mr. Chapman to their group. If shareholders approve his
nomination in late June, as they are expected to do, the son
of a U.S. Marine Corps officer will be the first non-Japanese
to sit on the 40-member board of Nomura, the world's biggest
securities firm.
   In some respects, Mr. Chapman will fit right in. He is
highly disciplined, a trait the Japanese like. He maintains
an athletic six-foot build through regular exercise, and his
weight of 200 hasn't varied by more than three pounds in 20
years.
   Despite its wealth, marketing prowess and dominant
position in Tokyo, Nomura has stumbled badly in the U.S.
   Of the estimated $1.5 billion in world-wide profit Nomura
earned in the fiscal year ended March 31, the contribution
from New York, the world's biggest capital market, was an
inconsequential $20 million, or 1.3%. The prior year, Nomura
lost $15 million in the U.S.
   But many see Mr. Chapman's job as not only to fix New
York, but also to help secure Nomura's commanding position in
the Tokyo market.
   There, Nomura must defend its turf against competing U.S.
firms that are more technologically advanced. This battle
comes at a critical juncture. The Tokyo stock market, where
Nomura is by far the largest brokerage house and where it
earns the bulk of its profit, has slid more than 19% this
year. And analysts project Nomura's profits could shrink as
much as one-third next year if conditions don't improve.
   A key question is how much autonomy Nomura will give Mr.
Chapman. Tokyo policies have several times cost its U.S. unit
profits and prestige. And while Nomura has hired Americans in
the past, often at fat salaries, it has ended up firing some
and watching others jump ship, frustrated with the rigidities
of Japanese management.
   "There is the bureaucratic inertia that results from a
system that is purely consensus management, a society that
avoids situations where anybody has to be embarrassed," said
Robin S. Koskinen, vice chairman of First Chicago Capital
Markets Inc. and a former executive at Nomura's U.S. unit.
"And one way to avoid embarrassment is to avoid making
decisions."
   Successful in bringing U.S. companies to Japan and Europe
to raise money, Nomura "always had trouble taking that to the
next step, to becoming an investment bank in the U.S. for
U.S. companies. To compete with a Morgan Stanley, a Merrill
Lynch and a Goldman Sachs is hard," said Donald Rigoni, a
vice president at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. and a
former Nomura employee. He added, "Nomura's strength
continued to be overly focused on the Japanese connection."
   Mr. Chapman sees his mission as changing that Japanese
orientation. "What I've been asked to do is build a company,
a sizable company that is sufficiently profitable to make a
contribution to Nomura, one that isn't tied to Tokyo."
   He also needs people, and he has gone on a hiring binge.
In March, he won a 48-hour tug of war with Kidder for the
services of Joseph R. Schmuckler, a computer program-trading
expert. At Nomura, Mr. Schmuckler will set up a program
trading unit that will allow investors to trade big baskets
of stocks around the world.
   This hiring victory was extra sweet for Mr. Chapman. He
had spent his entire career at Kidder, rising to president.
He resigned in February 1989 when he was passed over for
chief executive officer of Kidder's parent, a unit of General
Electric Co. Some Kidder executives say Mr. Chapman lost out
because he wasn't willing to pare down Kidder in light of
Wall Street's post-crash woes. The man who beat him out for
the top Kidder job, Michael Carpenter, personally tried and
failed to dissuade Mr. Schmuckler from changing firms.
   Mr. Chapman and Nomura executives initially became
acquainted three years ago when the big Japanese broker
considered purchasing 40% of Kidder from GE. The talks
collapsed following the October 1987 stock market crash.
   If there is one person responsible for Mr. Chapman's
hiring, it is Katsuya Takanashi, co-chairman of Nomura's U.S.
unit. Nomura executives in Tokyo say Mr. Takanashi believes
the giant firm must expand abroad or shrink. His biggest
challenge, they say, is persuading the rest of Nomura's board
to go along. Domestic business now accounts for roughly 87%
of the firm's bottom line.
   Arriving in the U.S. three years ago, Mr. Takanashi
quickly recognized that "only by exploiting inefficiencies do
you achieve profits" in the highly efficient, competitive
American market. But, Mr. Takanashi added, "it's very
difficult for outsiders to find these inefficiencies. It was
essential to have in the core management of Nomura America
somebody who was very experienced in the U.S. market."
   But with potential conflict at almost every turn, it won't
be easy. For example, Nomura isn't used to putting up a lot
of its own money to do business. "Nomura has been spoiled by
its Japanese retail business {dealing with individual
investors}, where it doesn't have to take big risks," said
Mr. Koskinen, the former Nomura executive. "As a consequence,
it is risk-averse because it has never had to commit capital
to its businesses."
   According to people close to him, the backbone of Mr.
Chapman's strategy for transforming an ineffectual U.S.
brokerage firm into a first-class investment bank is to
capitalize on two budding trends: the internationalization of
U.S. business and the need to reduce the large debt load of
U.S. companies. Mr. Chapman, these people say, wants to turn
Nomura into a firm that can provide midsized U.S. companies
with the funds and contacts to expand their business
globally.
   Another aspect of his strategy is the ability to deal in
so-called derivative products such as futures and options,
which complement the cash markets in stocks and bonds. While
U.S. competitors such as Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon
Brothers Inc. have long offered these services to their
clients, Nomura has lost business in the U.S. because it
wasn't as proficient in these areas.
   Among the hurdles Mr. Chapman faces is anti-Japanese
sentiment in the U.S. among customers, competitors and
politicians. To some extent, his all-American demeanor and
reputation in the financial world may offset such feelings.
   "He's tough as nails when he has to be. He exemplifies
leadership, says what he has to say," said Martin Davis,
chairman and chief executive of Paramount Communications Inc.
"With clients he tells you what you have to know, not
necessarily what you want to hear, which is extremely
important and in some cases a rarity."
   In the early 1980s, Nomura's U.S. unit grew at a measured
pace, its chief goal to become a primary dealer in U.S.
government securities, an elite group of banks and securities
firms that deal directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.
   But in mid-1986 when it realized it was well on its way to
becoming a primary dealer, Nomura began biting off more than
it could chew in the U.S. Trying to enter any market where it
believed it could make money, Nomura made mistakes on
personnel, strategy and committed too early to markets before
it could operate effectively in them.
   In the last half of 1986, the staff doubled to roughly
600. Then after the 1987 crash, Nomura reversed gears and
laid off about 20% of its U.S. staff, especially people
involved in sales and trading of U.S. stocks.
   Nomura has had a hard time cracking key U.S. markets. When
the firm first tried its hand at corporate finance in the
U.S., staff members were given lists of U.S. corporations to
call. Each night they had to report back to Tokyo, said
Sumiko Ito, a principal at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. who used
to work at Nomura's U.S. unit. These were hard-sell tactics
that had proved so successful in selling stocks to Japanese
individual investors. The technique didn't work with U.S.
multinational corporations interested in innovative
financings.
   In November 1986, Nomura tried for the first time to be a
lead underwriter in the U.S. It underbid all competitors for
a $250 million GE bond issue. The deal was a disaster. The
market turned against the firm, and Nomura's Tokyo
headquarters reneged and dumped its commitment to sell $125
million of the GE bonds back on New York.
   Days later, Nomura was offered the chance to co-lead
manage a $150 million bond issue for J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Again,
the firm blew an opportunity to enter the big leagues. Shaken
by the GE fiasco, senior Japanese executives were afraid even
to call headquarters in Tokyo to inform it about the deal,
and they instructed Americans to tell Morgan that no one was
available to make a decision.
   "I was dumbfounded," said a former employee. "The
Americans threw up their hands in despair and dismay over the
whole thing."
   The frustrations sometimes broke out into the open. In
early 1986, five Americans, upset at their Japanese
superiors, went on a two-day strike. They called themselves
the River Kwai Five after the movie "Bridge on the River
Kwai," in which Japanese soldiers force British prisoners of
war to build a bridge, only to see it destroyed.
   Mr. Chapman isn't unaware that many regard Nomura as the
Japanese firm most resistant to outsiders. While driving to
work, Mr. Chapman takes Japanese lessons from his secretary.
Still, he conceded, "I am an American. There's no way, no
matter how much I try to learn the language, that I'm going
to be Japanese, look like a Japanese, think Japanese."
   Mr. Chapman is taking such things in stride, mindful of
the unprecedented opportunity that has come his way. "It was
a difficult decision {for Nomura} to give up the proverbial
keys to the kingdom, to cross the Rubicon," he said. But he
quickly added, "I am more than a noble experiment. They made
a commitment that they need strong local management."

   HOLLYWOOD -- Flexing the muscles of its new ownership and
management, Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
beat out two rival studios and signed James L. Brooks to an
exclusive contract under which he will write, produce and
direct films and television shows.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but the arrangement, which runs
for seven years, could call for production funding of well
over $100 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Brooks is a rare, valuable bird in Hollywood. He makes
successful television shows (from the original "Mary Tyler
Moore Show" to the current "The Simpsons") and movies ("Terms
of Endearment" and "Big"). Competition was fierce for tying
up the deal, especially after Capital Cities/ABC Inc. gave
Mr. Brooks a commitment for at least three series in an
arrangement reportedly valued at $30 million. MCA Inc. is
understood to have been in the running up until the end.
   News Corp.'s Fox unit perhaps had the inside track. Mr.
Brooks has worked there for the past six years and has a long
history with Fox's chairman, Barry Diller. But talks with Fox
broke down last week over control of film and TV budgets,
according to individuals close to the situation.
   Mr. Brooks said the key to going to Columbia was creative
freedom. "If push comes to shove, I'll be able to make movies
I believe in -- even if I'm the only one who wants to make
them," he said.
   Recent Hollywood contracts have been astronomical. Film
producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer recently signed a
deal with Paramount Communications Inc. that is likely to
cost the studio from $100 million to $300 million to produce
films, with a hefty percentage of gross profits going to the
producers. Columbia has signed TV writer-producers to deals
paying several million dollars a year.
   Peter Guber, co-chairman of Columbia, first contacted Mr.
Brooks late last year, shortly after Sony installed Mr. Guber
and Jon Peters as heads of the studio.
   "We started pursuing Jim Brooks the minute we arrived at
Columbia," said President Alan J. Levine. Columbia TV
executives had been wooing Mr. Brooks even earlier, and it
was decided that the company go after an "overall" deal.
   Mr. Brooks still owes his next motion picture to Fox, and
"The Simpsons" and "The Tracy Ullman Show" will continue to
be produced there as well. But he will begin work on the
shows for ABC June 1.
   Under the arrangement, Columbia will provide funding for
Mr. Brooks's company, Gracie Films, to hire almost a dozen TV
writers, develop film scripts and pay for production of
movies and TV shows. Gracie Films will collect a fee and keep
a percentage of the profits.

   Initial Public Offerings Are Surging

   NEW YORK -- Initial public stock offerings are picking up,
although their volume still pales in comparison with the
heady days before the 1987 stock-market crash.
   There are signs of life on a broad front: A handful of new
technology issues are the darlings of the season. There has
been a spate of "reverse LBOs" -- with mixed results -- by
companies returning to the public market after the leveraged
buy-outs of years past.

   Energy companies have fueled new interest, as have some
medical technology (but not biotechnology) companies. Public
offerings of foreign stocks may be coming into vogue,
investment bankers say.
   "Only the better deals are going public" nowadays, says
Robert Natale, editor of Standard &amp; Poor's Emerging and
Special Situations newsletter. Many issues seem to be priced
more moderately than in precrash days.
   So far this year 71 companies have made their initial
public offerings, up from 46 last year, according to
Securities Data Co. The total market value of these companies
going public rose to $2.5 billion from $1.4 billion. (The
figures don't include initial public offerings of investment
funds.)
   Companies going public are, on average, smaller than in
the pre-crash era.
   "We're seeing a decent flow of business," says Sorrell
Mathes, managing director in charge of equity origination for
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He says the first four months
of 1990 rank as the fourth-most active year for initial
public offerings since 1982, excluding the publicly traded
investment companies known as closed-end funds.
   "I don't see any areas that are just dead," Mr. Mathes
says. "I've always thought and continue to think that the IPO
market is a subset of the general market. Industries which
are considered to be a good place to invest are a good place
to do" initial public offerings.
   Fleer Corp. may give investors something to chew on next
month when the Philadelphia maker of baseball cards and
Dubble Bubble gum goes public to pare debt it amassed last
year in a leveraged buy-out. Fleer is one of the more
promising "reverse LBOs" to appear on the initial public
offering landscape this year, analysts say. As companies
taken private during the era of leveraged buy-outs mature,
more of them will come to the public stock markets in search
of debt relief, according to investment bankers.
   This year's round of reverse leveraged buy-outs has been a
mixed bag, Mr. Natale points out, with many companies going
public at the low end or below their anticipated price range.
   Safeway sold a 10% stake to the public at $11.25 a share,
22% below the midpoint of the previously estimated range of
$13 to $16. Pinkerton went public at $14 a share; its
anticipated price was $14 to $16 a share.
   Geneva Steel went public in March at $10 a share, well
below the initially promoted range of $14 to $16 a share.
   But S&amp;P's Mr. Natale says Fleer may be more successful.
   Once a family-owned company, Fleer was purchased in August
in a leveraged acquisition by Charterhouse Equity Partners,
according to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., sole
underwriter of the planned initial public offering. Fleer
plans to offer 1.7 million shares to the public in early June
at $11 to $13 each to reduce debt. Debt was $31.3 million and
equity was $34.6 million on March 31.
   The deal's structure appeals to Mr. Natale. "Their debt
will be less than half of the committed capital after the
offering," he says. At a midpoint of $12 a share, Fleer's
shares would go public at slightly more than 11 times Mr.
Natale's estimated 1990 earnings of $1.05 a share.
   The analyst also likes the fact that Fleer is going public
at a discount to the valuation of its closest rival,
baseball-card maker Topps Co. Fleer should reach the public
at 13 times trailing 12-months earnings and one times
revenue, he says, compared with Topps' trading price of 17
times trailing earnings and 2.6 times revenue. Although Topps
has higher profit margins than Fleer, the latter's
baseball-card sales are growing at a faster rate, he adds.
   While reverse leveraged buy-outs may be emerging as a
trend, "the technology deals are catching the wave," says Mr.
Natale. Specialty companies that fill niches in
telecommunications and computer technology are doing well.
For instance, Telebit, a Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of modems
for sending data over telephone lines, closed Friday at 12
1/4; it went public April 26 at $10 a share.
   Aspect Telecommunications, a San Jose, Calif., maker of
transaction processing systems, went public May 2 at $14.50 a
share, above the anticipated range of $11 to $13 a share. It
closed Friday at 15 3/4.
   Investment bankers say more international companies may be
coming to the U.S. equities markets for capital. Mr. Mathes
of Merrill Lynch points to Luxottica Group, an Italian maker
of eyeglass frames that went public in January at $19 for
each American depositary receipt. Luxottica's ADRs closed
Friday at 23 3/4.
   New issues of biotechnology companies have given way to
offerings of medical technology and service concerns.
Pharmacy Management Services, a Tampa, Fla., provider of
medical cost-containment services, closed Friday at 17 1/2,
up from an April offering at $12 a share.
   Sullivan Dental Products, a West Allis, Wis., marketer of
dental supplies, ended the week at 16, well ahead of its
$10-a-share initial public offering in mid-April. On the
other hand, Tokos Medical, a provider of home-health-care
services, closed at 9 1/2, down from an initial public
offering at $12-a-share in late March.
   Among new energy companies are three oil and gas
exploration and production concerns that are trading below
their offering prices of more than two months ago. Cabot Oil
&amp; Gas, 14 5/8, went public at $16.75 a share; Hadson Energy
Resources, 10 3/4, was offered at $13; and Santa Fe Energy
Resources, 17, was issued at $18.25.
   Faring better is an oil and gas service company, Pool
Energy Services, at 13 1/4, up from its offering price of 10
1/4 in mid-April. Other new energy-service companies include
Teppco Partners, 18 7/8, down from a $20-a-share offering
price; and Tuboscope, 8 1/8, off its initial public offering
price of 8 1/2.
   Analysts and investment bankers say they expect the
initial public offering business to remain steady, ending the
year slightly stronger than 1989. Of course, they add, this
year's demand can't compare with 1987, when Mr. Natale
calculates there were 337 new issues at $5 a share or higher,
valued at a total of $23 billion. But given today's more
sober environment, "the new issues market is doing reasonably
well," he says.

   The over-the-counter market surged Friday on optimism over
interest rates.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 4.90, or 1.13%, to
438.10. Advancing stocks outpaced decliners, 1,203 to 723, as
volume rose to 167.5 million from 142.5 million.
   McCaw Cellular Communications rose 2 3/4 to 26 1/4. Smith
Barney, Harris Upham repeated its "buy" recommendation on the
stock, citing strong growth in subscribers to the
long-distance carrier, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report
said.
   National Data plunged 9 1/2 to 14 1/4. The Atlanta
data-processing company said it expects to report a loss for
the fourth quarter ending May 31 of eight cents a share,

   There's a New Wave
   In Sea Salvage Rules

<TEXT>
   DEEP SEA exploration may soon reach greater depths thanks
to a court decision involving high-tech salvaging.
   The pretrial ruling, handed down in a case in federal
court in Norfolk, Va., permits ocean explorers in
international waters to establish ownership of water-logged
treasure by using remote video cameras to produce live images
("tele-presence") and robots to retrieve objects
("tele-possession"). Previously, courts had ruled explorers
had to physically dive to a site to stake a claim.
   The wreck in question, the S.S. Central America, sank in
8,000 feet of water 160 miles off North Carolina in 1857. The
luxury steamship was bound for New York carrying 428
passengers and three tons of gold.
   The concept of tele-presence and tele-possession may reach
beyond the sunken ship, however. Before the ruling, only
nations had been found to have deep-ocean salvage rights in
international waters.
   The precedent granting individuals the same rights could
affect the future exploration and mining of deep-sea
minerals, says Richard T. Robol, a maritime expert at Hunton
&amp; Williams, a Richmond, Va., law firm; the firm is defending
a group of salvagers over legal claims to the ship's treasure
in a lawsuit now in court in Norfolk. Ultimately, the ruling
could extend to outer space in settling claims over the
recovery of stray satellites and space debris.
   "This is an exciting case for the freedom of individuals
to discover, both in the deep ocean and in outer space," says
Mr. Robol.
                                                                                                       

   Some Law Firms Create
   A Subspecialty in Art

   TASTE IN ART may be subjective, but art sales and exhibits
increasingly involve legal questions.
   As a result, some law firms are cultivating a subspecialty
that combines aspects of business, contract and international
law with a solid knowledge of art.
   A five-city U.S. tour of Ming and Qing dynasty paintings
(1368-1911) from China last year raised intricate contractual
problems as well as a touchy international question. When
contracting with museums, lawyers for the tour's sponsor had
to specify the exact type of light required to illuminate the
displays with minimal damage. But first, the lawyers had to
determine whether the works could be seized by Americans who
still have claims pending against China for property lost
when the Communists took power. (The answer was no.)
   "When art becomes more of an investment vehicle than a
cultural vehicle, a lot of business is involved," says Jack
R. Bershad, a Philadelphia corporate lawyer who negotiated
the Ming and Qing dynasty tour, as well as the $40 million
sale of Andrew Wyeth's "Helga" and "Olson" series.
   "Art law is a very specialized commercial practice," says
Caryn R. Leland, a New York lawyer whose sole practice is
representing artists. "You have a lot of contact with artists
and dealers, a lot of publications, a lot of copyright law,
museum loans, options to buy art." The field also includes
helping artists buy homes and negotiate divorces.
                                                                                                       

   Warning: Be Cautious
   In Worker-Theft Cases
                                                                                                       

   FIRING AN EMPLOYEE for heft can be trying for everyone,
particularly if it leads to a lawsuit.
   When a security director at Bloomingdale's in White Flint,
Md., found an allegedly stolen calculator in a salesman's
attache case, she detained him in her office, had him sign a
confession and led him through the store in tears. The
salesman filed a suit against Bloomingdale's alleging false
arrest, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional
distress. A Bloomingdale's lawyer says the store acted
properly.
   Maryland's highest court will soon decide whether the case
should be thrown out of court. The state's Workers'
Compensation Act, as in many states, bars suits against
employers for accidental job injuries that result in physical
disability. At issue here is whether the law also bars suits
in cases with no physical injuries.
   Employment specialists are warning employers to tread
delicately when investigating suspected theft in the
workplace. At all times, says Earle K. Shawe, an expert at
Shawe &amp; Rosenthal in Baltimore, employers should be sure
employees feel free to leave the room or building while being
questioned. Even refusing to allow a phone call or a run to
the bathroom, he adds, can lead to a claim of false
imprisonment.
                                                                                                       

   Rodeo Drive Exclusivity
   Doesn't Apply to Labels

   IF CINCINNATI is home of "Palm Beach Clothing" and "St.
Tropez" clothing is made in L.A., why can't Sidney Fell use
"Rodeo Drive" on his label?
   Mr. Fell says a group of specialty retailers on the famous
Beverly Hills, Calif., shopping street don't like the stores
-- Sears, Zayre, J.C. Penney and K mart -- that he sells his
children's clothing to. Mr. Fell's California Guys 'N Gals is
on South Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles.
   The Rodeo Drive Committee has done much to promote the
street's fabled exclusivity. But a federal judge in Los
Angeles last September said it went too far in suing Mr. Fell
in 1983 for trademark infringement.
   The group won an injunction barring Mr. Fell from using
the name on grounds it created confusion about the source of
the goods. But that ruling was reversed in February by U.S.
District Judge David V. Kenyon, who noted none of the stores
manufactures under "Rodeo Drive."
   Mr. Fell has resumed using the label and is pressing a
countersuit against the group for $5 million in damages.
Committee members declined to comment.

   Tokyo stocks moved sharply higher Friday, finally
responding positively to the yen's rebound after a week of
caution.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 531.88
points at 31512.14. The index added 34.65 points Thursday.

<TEXT>
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index rose
423.60 points to 31935.74.
   On Friday, London stocks were broadly higher in moderate
trading.
   At Tokyo, volume on the first section was estimated at 600
million shares Friday, down from 731 million Thursday.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which edged 4.02 points higher
Thursday, soared 36.12 points, or 1.56%, to 2348.97.
   The second section index, which advanced 38.25 points
Thursday, skyrocketed 63.67 points, or 1.70%, to 3819.82.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at 23 million
shares, up from 18.9 million Thursday.
   "The dollar moved into a technical sell signal at 155.55
yen, prompting stop-losses by Japanese institutions," said
Kevin Haag, a dealer in overseas operations at Nomura
Securities Co. As a result of the yen's rebound, "we saw a
lot of buying on domestics, as well as on some incentive
stocks," he said.
   Buying on major domestic issues, which had been lagging,
including Japan Airlines (JAL), Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone
(NTT) and KDD, pumped up the Nikkei 225 index in the
afternoon session.
   In addition, despite their export-oriented businesses,
high-priced, high-technology electricals also swelled,
reflecting overall market bullishness, Mr. Haag said.
   "It was basically up all the way, all afternoon," one
trader at a top Japanese brokerage house said.
   Mr. Haag said that "the stock market is on a much more
positive footing" now that "we may be moving into a new
trading for the yen-dollar." The yen's strength Friday had a
positive effect on the short-term bond market and stock bond
futures, he added.
   A new trading range for the yen-dollar rate "could have
major consequences for these companies" that have suffered
major profit weakness from the yen's deterioration, Mr. Haag
asserted. "We could have to revaluate corporate earnings
prospects on this basis."
   But Mr. Haag pointed out that the yen's recovery could
well be short term and said that the foreign-exchange markets
will have to be carefully watched.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo Friday at 154.17 yen,
plummeting from 156.75 in Tokyo late Thursday.
   According to Mahmoud Ghaemmaghami, manager of research and
a portfolio adviser at WestLB Securities Pacific Ltd., the
yen's strengthening is linked to the Group of Seven's
communique on the importance of a stronger yen for global
economic adjustment, and the theory that interest rates in
the U.S. have peaked.
   The scenario has improved for the undervalued Japanese
stock market, as support for the currency may translate into
greater inflow of money into Japanese financial instruments,
both bonds and equity, Mr. Ghaemmaghami said.
   Gains were spread across the board, with special interest
in low-priced steel, real estate, electric power and bank
stocks.
   Nippon Steel, Nisshin Steel, Kawasaki Steel and NKK were
all higher.
   Industrial Bank of Japan rose 180 yen ($1.15) to 4,180 yen
($26.64), Sumitomo Bank climbed 60 to 2,660 and Fuji Bank
rose 50 to 2,780.
   JAL gained 1,000 to 18,600, KDD added 1,300 to 16,800 and
NTT advanced 40,000 to 1.8 million.
   Sony added 270 to 8,710, TDK advanced 120 to 6,880 and
Kyocera rose 290 to 7,640. Fanuc gained 230 to 7,250.
   London shares finished broadly higher as the market
rallied on better-than-expected U.K. inflation data for
April, released early in the session.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
up 18.9 points at 2175.9, well above its low for the day of
2155.6 and off from the 2182.3 peak.
   At the close, the narrower FT 30 share index was up 18
points at 1708.8. Volume was 510.1 million shares,
considerably better than the 406.3 million on Thursday.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
finished at 2215.0, up from its close of 2194 Thursday.
   Shares began climbing after the release of the U.K.'s
retail price index for April, which showed inflation running
9.4% higher than a year earlier, but still below expectations
of double digits.
   "Anything less than 10% was going to rally the market,"
said a market maker.
   Both markups and technical short covering ahead of the
close of the two-week trading account pushed the market
higher, dealers said. Prices fell back slightly for a short
time, but were triggered into further gains by favorable U.S.
economic data that indicated interest rates wouldn't be
boosted in the near future, traders said.
   Additionally, some fresh buying followed the opening of
the new trading account, which further bolstered share
prices, dealers said.
   Some dealers were bullish about the market's short-term
prospects, but were cautious about predicting large and
sustainable gains for the FT-SE 100.
   "I don't think there's going to be a major rally unless
something dramatic changes," such as a reduction of U.K.
interest rates or a downturn in inflation -- neither of which
is likely in the near future, a market maker said.
   While overall gloom still overhangs the market, another
trader said investors were more cautious than bearish these
days.
   In corporate news, Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products
giant Unilever rose 10 pence (16.7 cents) to 647 on
first-quarter results that showed a 5.2% pretax gain, in line
with market expectations.
   ECC Group fell 11 to 348 after reporting a 23% drop in
interim pretax profit and an acquisition that the market
considered overly expensive.
   Elsewhere around the market, automotive, industrial and
defense group GKN lost 6 to 360, continuing to suffer after a
profit warning Thursday.
   Most blue-chip stocks posted gains in sympathy with the
general market tone.
   Thorn EMI rose 10 to 677; Courtaulds jumped 12 to 319 and
petroleum group Lasmo advanced 11 to 383.
   Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Amsterdam and
Stockholm and lower in Paris, Frankfurt and Milan. Prices
were mixed in Brussels. South African gold stocks closed
weaker.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney and Singapore; lower
in Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul and mixed in Manila and
Wellington.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   Marketing &amp; Media:
   Former `Today' Producer Friedman
   To Take Charge of `NBC Nightly News'

   NEW YORK -- In an unexpected move that further heightened
the uncertainty at NBC News, Steve Friedman, a former
executive producer of the "Today" show, is returning as the
executive in charge of the struggling "NBC Nightly News with
Tom Brokaw."
   The appointment, effective June 4, was widely perceived at
NBC News as foreshadowing the addition of Jane Pauley to join
the broadcast in a major role, perhaps as co-anchor. Ms.
Pauley, a former co-anchor of "Today," is considered
extremely popular among viewers. Equally important, she is
also popular among NBC affiliated stations, a majority of
whom were displeased when Ms. Pauley left "Today," causing
the show to plummet from its No. 1 ranking in its time slot.
Ms. Pauley did not return telephone calls to her home.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Friedman, 43 years old, considered a gregarious,
informal and somewhat bombastic talented producer, replaces
Bill Wheatley, a 15-year veteran of NBC News who has been
executive producer of the flagship newscast for five years.
Mr. Friedman said that "nobody has ever said I have to bring
Jane onto the broadcast and no decision has been made."
   He added, however, "it doesn't make any sense just to
divide up reading the news between Jane and Tom." There was
speculation that Mr. Brokaw could often anchor from different
locations dictated by breaking news stories and Ms. Pauley
could be studio based. Since leaving "Today," Ms. Pauley has
become the primary substitute anchor for "Nightly News."
   Mr. Friedman said he does not believe in "incremental"
changes. "So what if you add new graphics?" he asked. "We
have to say this is what we're going to do and do it and hope
we're right. We're not going to be tied down to the
constipated view of the world on the evening newscasts."
   Mr. Brokaw told colleagues he was not consulted about the
change, but rather that it was presented to him on Thursday
by NBC News President Michael Gartner as a "done deal,"
according to people who said they spoke with Mr. Brokaw.
   It is considered highly unusual in broadcasting for
management not to consult the anchorman, who also acts as the
broadcast's managing editor, about such a major change. Mr.
Brokaw told a staff meeting on Friday that there were "cold,
bloodless realities" facing broadcast journalism, although he
did not elaborate, according to people who were present. He
also reportedly told colleagues that it was a "sad day" for
NBC News. In an interview, he did not comment on his reported
remarks, except to add that in reference to Mr. Wheatley, "it
always hurts to lose one of the good guys." He added Mr.
Friedman was "smart and enthusiastic" and that he always felt
Mr. Friedman was "underestimated as a hard-news producer."
   The move stunned the staff of "Nightly News," especially
since NBC president Robert C. Wright reportedly told a group
of network executives at a meeting in Princeton, N.J.,
recently that NBC News' problem was not "Nightly News", but
rather "Today." Mr. Friedman's appointment is just one of
several major changes expected at the beleaguered news
division of the National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General
Electric Co.
   NBC News is negotiating with CBS News' "Morning News"
co-anchor Faith Daniels to become anchor of "Sunrise" and
news reader on "Today," a position that has been open since
Deborah Norville replaced Ms. Pauley on "Today" late last
year. An announcement could come as early as today.
   The sudden moves by NBC News are an attempt to blunt the
expected sharp criticism from the network's 200-plus
affiliates in Washington in two weeks at the annual NBC
convention. Although the network is No. 1 in prime time and
is robust financially, the stations are unhappy with the
performance of NBC News, according to interviews with several
general managers.
   In the past year, "Nightly News" has been No. 3 for 36
weeks, while the "Today" show has lost its ratings dominance,
resulting in the stations losing millions in annual
advertising revenue.
   In an interview, Mr. Wheatley, 45, said the change came as
a "complete surprise. I didn't expect it, that's for sure."
He said he was told by Mr. Gartner on Thursday that Mr.
Gartner wanted "Nightly News" to "go in a different direction
with new leadership." Mr. Wheatley said he has been offered
other assignments at NBC News and "I'm going to take the next
few months off to see how I fit into the changing climate of
television news."
   Mr. Friedman resigned from NBC three years ago to become
president of GTG East and create a televised version of the
newspaper USA Today. The show, "USA Today on TV," which
stressed what Mr. Friedman labeled "journalism of hope," was
the largest failure in TV syndication history and went off
the air last November.
   Mr. Friedman resigned from GTG East last May and the
parent company, GTG Entertainment, a partnership between
former NBC chairman Grant A. Tinker and the Gannett Co.,
collapsed. GTG went out of business earlier this year after
Gannett withdrew financial support.

   Kidder May Dismiss 10% of Work Force

   NEW YORK -- A new cost-cutting drive at Kidder, Peabody
Group Inc. could result in the dismissal of as many as 10% of
the firm's employees, according to people familiar with the
firm.
   One target of the layoffs at the General Electric Co. unit
is likely to be its investment banking division, which
recently was beefed up and now has more than 400 staff
members, the people said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kidder, for its part, stressed that it has no specific
target for layoffs. "We are continuing to look at ways to
reduce costs," a Kidder representative said, adding that
"there may be some further streamlining." The firm's head
count already is down about 200 from year-end levels of about
5,600, Kidder officials said.
   Kidder, which had losses of about $23 million in 1989,
dismissed more than 10% of its staff last year. Michael
Carpenter, chief executive officer, recently said Kidder
expected a 1990 first-quarter loss of about $25 million,
reflecting losses in selling its high-risk, high-yield "junk"
bonds and other risky investments to GE.
   The investment banking units of most big securities firms
have been hit hard by the depressed level of
corporate-finance and merger-and-acquisition activity. So far
this year, announced takeover deals totaled just $71 billion
-- barely half the $134 billion in the year-earlier period,
according to Securities Data Co. And investment-banking
revenue at many securities firms plunged more than 20% during
the first quarter from a year earlier.
   Several other firms, including Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., have dismissed scores of investment bankers; analysts
expect other firms to follow suit. Since the 1987
stock-market crash, more than 45,000 jobs have been lost in
the securities industry, according to the Securities Industry
Association.
   The Kidder cost-cutting effort follows a recently
announced $550 million recapitalization plan under which
Kidder agreed to sell its portfolio of risky investments --
including junk bonds, temporary "bridge" loans and
merchant-banking holdings -- for $750 million to GE Capital
Corp., another GE unit. In turn, Kidder will give $200
million to GE Financial Services, the GE entity that controls
Kidder and GE Capital.
   "GE Capital happens to be a very skilled banker, and they
may be doing some of those activities themselves," says James
Hanbury, a Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. analyst. "Hence, there's
less need" for investment-banking staff members.
   Separately, Kidder said it plans to abolish its regional
management system. The firm told staff members Friday that
its four regional managers -- who oversee Kidder's 1,400
stockbrokers and 44 branches -- will be reassigned.
   Steven Goddard, Western region manager, will retire at
year-end; Jack Higgins, head of the New England region, will
resume his activities as a broker; William Kennedy, Eastern
region manager, will be promoted to the newly created post of
senior operating officer of national sales; and Steven
Satkamp, Central region head, will become manager of Kidder's
Chicago branch. Mr. Satkamp succeeds Frank Malone, who will
remain as a managing director and a member of Kidder's
national strategic sales group.
   The shuffle reflects an attempt to run Kidder much as GE
runs itself: with the fewest possible layers of management,
Kidder officials said. Rather than being a full-service firm,
Kidder has been trying to focus on wealthy individuals, small
companies and small institutions.

   BFS Bancorp reported first-quarter net income fell 55% to
$770,000, or 54 cents a share, partly from a tripling of its
provision for loan losses.
   The Bristol, Conn., holding company for Bankers Federal
Savings noted that first-quarter net also included a smaller
gain from the sale of investment securities, compared with a
year earlier. Year-ago first-quarter profit was $1.7 million,
or $1.18 a share.

   The company's provision for loan losses increased to
$310,000 from $101,000 a year earlier. The company said
nonperforming loans are above historical levels but below the
level of a year earlier. A spokeswoman said the bank didn't
expect any further increases in its loan-loss reserve.
   Interest income before provisions for loan losses
increased 4% during the first quarter to $3 million from $2.9
million a year earlier.
   In April, BFS settled litigation with a dissident
shareholder, First Capital Group, a Redondo Beach, Calif.,
investment firm. As part of the settlement, First Capital
gave up a seat on the company's board that it had won in a
proxy fight.
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, BFS closed at
$8.75 a share, down 75 cents.

   Maxxam-Unit Suit
   Notification Ruled
   Necessary by Judge

   EUREKA, Calif. -- A judge said any prospective buyer of
assets of Maxxam Inc.'s Pacific Lumber unit must be notified
that the plaintiff in a pending lawsuit could be awarded
those assets.
   Robert Martel, who filed the suit alleging fraud in
Maxxam's 1985 takeover of Pacific Lumber, said Thursday's
ruling by a Superior Court judge in Humboldt County would
make it more difficult for the company to sell the unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We claim in our underlying suit that Maxxam doesn't even
own this property, that it belongs to the former shareholders
of Pacific Lumber," he said. "So this ruling . . . warns
prospective buyers or lenders that the property is in
question. It stops the company from financially transferring
property they don't own."
   San Francisco attorney David Robertson of Morrison &amp;
Foerster, representing Maxxam, said he would petition an
appellate court to reverse the ruling this week. He said the
ruling was "procedural . . . the judge wasn't considering the
merits." He added that the ruling would have no effect on the
operations of the company.
   But Attorney Thomas C. Petersen, who assisted Mr. Martel
in his legal battle, said the ruling could make it more
difficult for Maxxam to restructure its Pacific Lumber debt.
Reports earlier this year said Pacific Lumber was considering
a plan to retire its nearly $580 million of junk-bond debt,
originally underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and
instead borrow the money from banks and insurance companies,
which would buy bonds backed by the company's rich timber
assets.
   Maxxam's secretary, Byron Wade, declined comment on its
plans for the debt or any other issue related to the ruling.
   The court ruling also means that any lender seeking
collateral from Pacific Lumber assets must be notified that a
lawsuit is pending which could award those assets to the
plaintiff.
   Mr. Martel, co-publisher of the Country Activist, a
monthly journal in Humboldt County, brought suit last March
against Maxxam; Maxxam Chairman Charles Hurwitz, a Houston
investor; former Drexel junk-bond wizard Michael Milken; Ivan
Boesky and others, alleging fraud in the takeover. The suit
seeks to invalidate the merger, and also seeks class-action
status.
   It was unclear what effect the ruling would have on other
litigation against Maxxam over the takeover, which includes a
consolidated lawsuit filed by former shareholders seeking
$2.25 billion, on grounds similar to Mr. Martel's suit.
Pacific Lumber was also cited in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's suit against Drexel and Mr. Milken.
   In Thursday's ruling, Judge William F. Ferroggiaro Jr.
denied a motion by Maxxam to expunge a "lis pendens" -- a
right to notify people that litigation is pending and that
company property could be won back by former shareholders if
they prevail in their lawsuit.
   The Maxxam takeover also became the focus of outrage from
environmentalists after Mr. Hurwitz doubled the rate of
cutting redwoods at Pacific Lumber in order to service the
debt. Equally upset were local workers, concerned that the
furious new production would deplete resources and attract
the attention of environmentalists, jeopardizing their jobs.
   Although Pacific Lumber was at one time well-regarded by
environmental groups, two environmentally sponsored
initiatives dealing with redwood preservation are awaiting
signature certification to be placed on the California ballot
this year. They would include bond measures for the state to
buy and set aside old-growth redwood reserves.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Bond market sentiment is turning bullish to
the point of euphoria, leading some analysts to warn that
investors may be overlooking the potholes ahead on the road
to lower rates.
   After being in the dumps for more than six months, bond
prices are rallying sharply and investors are reaping quick
profits. In less than two weeks, the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond has rocketed more than four points, a gain of
about $40 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. On Friday
alone, the Treasury's long-term bond jumped more than two
points, the biggest one-day rally so far this year, on news
of declining producer prices and retail sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But while many fixed-income portfolio managers believe
that the bond market will continue to improve, they are
bracing for what they believe will be a bumpy ride. They say
the current rally could be a false start.
   "Whenever the market goes up this much and this quickly,
it always goes into a corrective pattern," said Roberta
Olsen, a portfolio manager at Banc One Asset Management Corp.
"Right now I'm looking to sell some bonds," she said, but she
is ready to buy bonds heavily as prices weaken.
   Frankie D. Hughes, a portfolio manager at W.R. Lazard &amp;
Co., also is taking a cautious approach to the market.
Although she believes that Treasury bond yields could fall as
low as 8% over the course of the year, she's "a little
leery," because bond market sentiment seems to have turned
from bearish to bullish on the weight of inconclusive
economic news. "There hasn't been any great big fundamental
change in the economy in the past two weeks" to justify the
market's sharp move, said Ms. Hughes.
   The Labor Department reported on Friday that producer
prices, a measure of inflation, fell 0.3% in April, following
a 0.2% decline the month before. Separately, the Department
of Commerce said retail sales slid a steep 0.6% in April,
attributable largely to a sharp decline in car sales.
   The statistics bolstered bond prices because they
suggested that the economy isn't resurging and inflation is
under control. The reports, coming after a weak economic
report released on May 4, put a lid on speculation that the
Federal Reserve may push up interest rates. Now, many
economists believe the Fed will leave interest rates
unchanged.
   While this should be good for bonds in the long run, money
managers say a number of difficulties stand in the way of a
sustained rally. Their caution stems in part from bitter
experience. They were overly pessimistic at the beginning of
last year, missing part of a rally, and got stung again as
they were fully invested when the market declined in the
summer.
   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp., is
warning buyers to be prepared for a few potential "problems
on the horizon." One is the growing size of federal and
municipal borrowings. Mr. Sohn estimates that the federal
government will raise $124 billion in cash in the first three
quarters of 1990, up from $71 billion in the first three
quarters of 1989.
   "That's a lot of money that has to be raised, and could
create some indigestion in the market," he said. Moreover,
the looming supply "could keep rates from coming down
significantly."
   Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp.,
notes that while inflation isn't accelerating, it's still a
long way from what the Fed would consider acceptable.
Meanwhile, he believes that the economy, although weak, isn't
going into a recession.
   Therefore, Mr. Robertson thinks it unlikely that the Fed
will ease credit policy anytime soon. And without a Fed
easing, he said, bond yields won't fall far enough to result
in a sustained market rally.
   "I must say that some of the euphoria is a little
overdone," said Mr. Robertson. "I don't think that we've won
the war against inflation. It's still very much with us."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds ended sharply higher in the biggest rally
of the year as market players put their concerns about
economic growth and inflation behind them.
   The rally was sparked by two economic reports, which
showed sharp declines in producer prices and retail sales.
The reports indicated that inflationary pressures may be less
severe than had been thought previously and that modest
economic growth is continuing -- good news for a bond market
anxious to avoid any tightening in Federal Reserve
interest-rate policy.
   Prices also were boosted as a wave of relief washed over
the market following Thursday's final leg of the Treasury's
$30.5 billion quarterly note and bond sale.
   The Treasury's new 30-year bellwether bond, the 8 3/4%
coupon bond that was auctioned Thursday by the Treasury,
surged 2 2/32 points in when-issued trading activity. That
was a gain of more than $20 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The yield on the issue, which was set at 8.84% at
Thursday's auction, eased to 8.63% on Friday. The Treasury's
former 30-year benchmark bond rose 1 23/32 points on Friday.
   Intermediate-maturity securities also posted strong gains.
In when-issued trading, the Treasury's new 10-year note ended
at 101 14/32 to yield 8.64%, up 1 7/32 points on the day. The
yield on the notes was set at 8.88% when they were auctioned
on Wednesday.
   Short-term rates were sharply lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills was quoted late Friday at about
7.62% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.89%, compared with a
rate of 7.72% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.96% on
Thursday.
   Treasurys surged despite the dollar's weakness,
particularly against the yen. The dollar's decline came amid
hectic dollar selling in the Japanese currency market.
   In the corporate bond market, both investment-grade and
junk bonds posted strong advances.
   Most junk bonds, the speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or none at all, gained half a point.
   Among the biggest gainers in the junk market were the 13%
senior notes of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which were three
points higher in late afternoon trading.
   One of the biggest losers: Charter Medical Corp., whose
junk bonds plunged five points on news that the company
reported sharply lower second-quarter earnings.
   Investment-grade corporate debt, which has been a slow
mover for much of the year, climbed as much as 1 1/4 points
Friday.

   Stock Rally Bodes

   Many Observers Say

   Up, up and away?
   For many analysts and investors, Friday's euphoric stock
and bond market rallies unequivocally pointed the way stock
prices are headed in the long run.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For months, bored investors have watched stock prices
mosey back and forth between a Dow Jones Industrial Average
high of about 2800 and a low of around 2600. The big debate
has been whether prices would shoot higher or sink lower when
they finally broke out of that range. Until Friday, the
weight of evidence tilted toward down rather than up.
   But if Friday's surge in bond prices really does mark a
turn toward declining interest rates -- and many analysts
contend that it does -- the stage may be set for a solid
stock market rally. Of course, nothing is guaranteed and
there remain some worrisome factors in both the stock market
and the nation's economy. However, some of the analysts who
have been very cautious over the past several months have
begun to believe that chances of a sustained rally are now
greater than the odds for a big drop.
   "The rally in the bond market is substantial enough to
justify a more encouraging view," says James Solloway,
economist at Argus Research in New York. "We're more inclined
to think positively about the market because we've gone
through kind of a dangerous period and now we seem to be
coming out of it."
   After Friday's market performance Mr. Solloway says Argus
analysts are reviewing their investment stance of 40% in
stocks, 40% in bonds and 20% in cash. Argus, which has held a
conservative view of the market and the economy since last
October, is likely to shift some money out of cash and into
stocks.
   The way Mr. Solloway sees it, Friday's stock-price
explosion was ignited by the bond market's strong run-up,
which in turn was powered by two developments: The three-day
auction of a record $31.5 billion in new Treasury debt was
relatively successful, and on Friday the government reported
that wholesale inflation in April fell 0.3%. Most economists
had estimated that the producer price index rose 0.2% in
April.
   But he doesn't expect stock prices to rocket up hundreds
of points in the next few weeks. "There are two ways to go
up," he says. "One is to go straight up, and the other is a
more gradual move that picks up steam over time."
   While the outlook for falling interest rates has pushed
stock prices out of their rut in the right direction, it will
take more to keep them moving upward. That catalyst could be
the negotiations between the Bush administration and Congress
to get the nation's budget deficit under control, says Mr.
Solloway.
   "Suddenly there's a lot of talk about Bush getting a new
pair of lips," he says, referring to the possibility of a
deficit-trimming agreement that includes higher taxes. "I'm
somewhat skeptical about anything really happening, but if we
could get just modest movement on the fiscal side, it could
have a terrifically marvelous impact on investor psychology."
   But there are still big problems confronting the market,
Mr. Solloway cautions. Among them: high corporate debt levels
and no assurances of growth in corporate profits. "We're
still in a period of danger with regard to the economy," he
says. "There are still concerns about profits and leverage,
and that should limit how strong the economy can get for some
time. But this may be the psychological turn that precedes
the economic turn up."
   Although Mr. Solloway's firm may recommend using cash to
buy more stocks, the portfolio of issues that Argus is
recommending remains on the cautious side. Food, beverage and
pharmaceuticals will continue to be the primary focus,
although utilities will be getting increased attention as
interest rates fall. Investors who want some manufacturing
exposure in their portfolios should stick with technology, he
says, and probably shouldn't venture into basic industrial
stocks, at least yet. "We think basic industry will still be
bringing up the rear, although they, too, may kick in within
a few months."
   Anthony Hitschler, a money manager at Brandywine Asset
Management in Wilmington, Del., is taking a more aggressive
view of where the economy is headed. His firm is heavily
weighted toward basic industry and financial stocks on the
assumption that the economy will rebound, although perhaps
not immediately.
   His view is reinforced by the lecture that Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan gave bankers last week, in which he
told them to go ahead and lend money to good credit risks.
Ever since the comptroller of the currency began late last
year to tighten standards on risky real estate loans that
some banks have made, many banks have tightened credit
standards not only for real estate borrowers but also for
other credit-seekers. To the extent that Mr. Greenspan's
comments ease fears among bankers that they won't be unduly
criticized for following normal lending guidelines, borrowers
should find it easier to meet their financing needs.
   "The reluctance of bankers to lend because of the
regulators' crackdown has to have been a drag on the
economy," says Mr. Hitschler. "Maybe now the banks will begin
to relax a little bit."
   From a technical standpoint, Friday's big rally certainly
changes the near-term outlook for stocks. Kenneth Spence,
director of the technical analysis group at Salomon Brothers,
says $1 billion flowed into the stock market Friday, setting
in motion tremendous pressure for further buying in the weeks
ahead. "When you generate the kind of momentum we did Friday
you buy time for the market," he says. He's looking for the
industrial average to hit 2850 or even 2900 in the next few
weeks.
   But he warns that just as there remain fundamental
problems in the stock market and the economy, there are
potential technical pitfalls as well. While the industrial
average could hit a new high this week, the transportation
and utility averages almost certainly won't. Neither will the
number of stocks hitting new highs nor the cumulative total
of advancing minus declining stocks each day.
   Without those confirming indicators, Mr. Spence says, "I'm
very suspicious that this isn't a broad and sustainable
advancing market." Instead, he says, the market may behave as
it did when the Dow industrials hit their previous record
highs in October 1989 and this past January: Prices promptly
retreated.

   Friday Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which peaked late in the
session less than six points from a record high, surged 63.07
to 2801.58. The average closed Jan. 2 at a record 2810.15,
and on Jan. 3 closed above 2800 for only the second time
until Friday.
   Trading was the heaviest this year on the New York Stock
Exchange. More than 234 million shares changed hands on the
Big Board, compared with just 158.5 million Thursday. The
increase came from a combination of brisk activity among both
domestic and foreign institutions, buying to cover previous
short sales and repeated waves of futures-related buy
programs.
   The unexpected 0.3% drop in the April producer price index
laid the groundwork for the market's surge by easing concerns
about a possible pickup in inflationary pressures and by
increasing optimism that interest rates have peaked.
   Coupled with another surprising piece of economic data --
a 0.6% drop in April retail sales, which had been expected to
show a modest increase -- the PPI report set off a rally in
the bond market that drove yields on Treasury issues sharply
lower.
   As rates fell, the rally in stocks began gaining momentum
at late morning when the day's first round of buy programs
tied to stock-index arbitrage hit the market. At least half a
dozen more flurries of arbitrage-related buying, which
involved the sale of index-futures contracts and the purchase
of baskets of stocks to profit from price differences between
them, bolstered stocks as the session progressed.
   Advancing issues on the Big Board outnumbered decliners by
1,282 to 339. Among broader indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's
500stock index rose 8.18 to 352.00, the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index gained 4.10 to 192.24 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index climbed 7.10 to 327.06.
   Friday's rally pushed the Dow industrials to its sharpest
weekly advance of the year -- 100.21 points, or 3.7%.
Previously, the biggest gain this year was 96.17 points in
the week ended March 2.
   Federal National Mortgage Association surged 2 to 38 3/4
in Big Board composite trading of 2.8 million shares as the
surge in bonds and the easing of interest-rate worries
brought financial stocks into favor.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage jumped 3 1/4 to 70 1/8.
   Savings-and-loan issues scored especially sharp gains in
percentage terms; Great Western Financial, for example,
posted a 5.1% advance by rising 7/8 to 18 1/8; H.F. Ahmanson
gained 3/4 to 18 5/8; Golden West Financial rose 1 to 28 7/8,
and HomeFed jumped 1 3/4 to 31 3/8.
   Citicorp rose 1 1/8 to 23 7/8 as 2.5 million shares
changed hands. Other big city bank issues rallied as well;
J.P. Morgan rose 1 1/4 to 36 3/4; Chase Manhattan added 1 1/8
to 25 1/4, and Chemical Banking rose 3/4 to 25 3/4.
   Consumer stocks whose results don't tend to be closely
linked to the economy were also a hit with investors, as the
retail sales data pointed to the possibility of sluggish
economic growth. Philip Morris rose 7/8 to 44 1/4 on 3.7
million shares, while Coca Cola Co. surged 3 1/4 to 83 1/4;
PepsiCo gained 2 1/4 to 69 5/8; Procter &amp; Gamble climbed 1
3/4 to 75 3/8, and Anheuser-Busch added 1 1/8 to 39 3/4.
   Pfizer jumped 3 3/8 to 60 5/8 after the National
Institutes of Health released a study that recommended use of
its drug Fluconazole to prevent recurrences of AIDS-related
meningitis. The study concluded that the drug was "at least
as effective and possibly superior" to another one currently
in use.
   Elsewhere in the drug sector, Merck rose 1 5/8 to 77 1/4;
Warner-Lambert gained 2 1/4 to 111 1/2; Eli Lilly added 2 1/8
to 71 3/4; Upjohn rose 1 1/8 to 38 7/8, and Syntex gained 1
1/4 to 53 1/4. Eastman Kodak, the parent of Sterling Drug,
rallied 1 1/2 to 40 5/8.
   France Growth Fund, a new single-country mutual fund,
closed 13.5% above the price of its initial offering. The
stock, sold at $12 a share, rallied to 13 5/8 on four million
shares; 10 million were sold in the offering.
   Honeywell fell 7/8 to 94 1/8. The company plans to proceed
with a spinoff of its defense and marine systems business
after failing to find a buyer for the unit.

   Two shareholders, David C. Walentas and Stanford M.
Dinstein, said they may make an offer to acquire Builders
Transport Inc. whether or not their plans for a possible
proxy fight to oust the board is successful.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Messrs. Walentas and Dinstein, who hold together a 7.8%
stake, said that if they don't make an acquisition proposal
before Builders Transport's annual meeting, they will seek
the sale of the company to the highest bidder if their
nominees are elected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two said they plan to ask Builders Transport's board
for confidential data and intend to review the information
before deciding whether and at what price to make an offer.
According to the filing, Messrs. Walentas and Dinstein formed
a committee on May 2 in connection with their possible proxy
contest. Each of the members has agreed to be a nominee on
the dissidents' slate.
   In Camden, S.C., Robert Lee Garner, Builders' general
counsel and corporate secretary, said the company hasn't
received a copy of the filing, and had no comment.

   Esselte Business Systems Inc., Garden City, N.Y., reported
first-quarter net income fell 28%, partly because of weak
demand for the company's retail supplies, equipment and
office supplies.
   Net dropped to $12.4 million, or 60 cents a share, from
$17.4 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Part of
the decline was caused by an increase in interest expense
from debt related to acquisitions. Sales rose 8.7% to $398.9
million from $367 million. Esselte attributed about one-third
of the sales growth to improving foreign-exchange rates.

   Commodities:
   London Metals Exchange Plans U.S. Beachhead
   For Futures Business With Four Warehouses

   The British are coming]
   Last week, directors of the London Metals Exchange
approved plans to open four metal-storage warehouses in the
U.S., a move that several board members said is "just the
beginning" of an effort to build more U.S. business for the
British exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The metal exchange has initially selected as warehouse
sites Baltimore, Bridgeport/New Haven, Conn., Chicago and
Toledo, Ohio. According to Martin Abbott, director of
marketing for the exchange, these locations are subject to
the availability of suitable warehouse space that meets metal
exchange standards.
   "The next step is in the hands of warehouse companies
applying to us and being approved," Mr. Abbott added. He also
said that a key consideration was that a location be near, or
in, a region of the country that uses metals in
manufacturing.
   The metal exchange currently has 80 warehouses in Europe,
Japan and Singapore where producers and consumers may make
and take delivery of the base metals in which they deal. The
exchange trades contracts in aluminum, copper, lead, nickel,
tin and zinc.
   David King, chief executive of the metal exchange (LME),
said that the U.S. warehouses would be prepared to handle all
the metals except copper; initially, lead also will probably
not be stored. Mr. King added that he believed the warehouses
will primarily be used for aluminum.
   The warehouses will not be available for use until three
months after they have been approved by the LME.
   The metal exchange decided not to handle copper in the
U.S. because it does not want head-to-head competition with
New York's Commodity Exchange.
   "We believe that if we were to open our U.S. warehouses to
copper it would become a battle for liquidity in the U.S.
market," said Mr. King. He added, "The LME is not looking for
gratuitous violence in the copper market." The Comex has
copper warehouses in 19 cities in the U.S.
   Commodity exchanges that trade futures contracts on metals
provide warehouses so that producers and consumers can take
or dispose of the metal if they wish.
   For example, a producer of aluminum who has sold contracts
to protect against falling prices may deliver aluminum to an
authorized warehouse to satisfy his short position instead of
buying back the contracts to offset his sale. Similarly, a
consumer of aluminum who has bought futures contracts to
guard against higher prices may take delivery of aluminum
from an authorized warehouse instead of selling his futures
contracts to end his obligation.
   A spokesman for the Comex said the exchange welcomes the
competition from the metal exchange and added, "It will keep
us on our toes." He said that the Comex recently has been
exploring ways to improve the volume in its lightly traded
aluminum contract. Though the aluminum contract has been
revised at least twice, it has never attracted a following
among producers, dealers and consumers. The metal exchange
traded three million aluminum contracts in 1989 compared with
only 741 at the Comex.
   John Gross, president of J.E. Gross &amp; Associates, a firm
that consults to the metals industry, says he believes the
LME's U.S. warehouses will make the exchange's already
liquid, active aluminum contract more useful to the trade.
"It remains to be seen whether the trade will use these
warehouses," he said, "but I believe they will."
   A spokesman for Aluminum Co. of America in Pittsburgh says
the company uses metal exchange contracts to hedge some of
its output periodically. Depending upon the specific
locations of the U.S. warehouses, the company may make
delivery to them, the spokesman added.
   The president of a Vermont-based metals-dealing firm,
David Threlkeld of Threlkeld &amp; Co., says the U.S. warehouses
will bring the prices for metals traded in the U.S. and
London more into line. He added, "I believe that though the
LME won't warehouse copper right away, they ultimately will."
Mr. Threlkeld says such a move will drain business away from
the Comex. In 1989 the metal exchange traded 4.52 million
copper contracts while the Comex handled 2.1 million.
   Robert Green, president of Connecticut Minerals &amp; Metals
Inc., another metals consulting firm, says it is not clear
what the warehouses' net effect will be on the U.S. metals
industry. "It's possible the LME's warehouses could spark a
rebirth for the Comex's aluminum contract." He said that this
could come about by providing convenient arbitrage
opportunities for traders.
   An arbitrager might accept delivery of metal from a
warehouse bought on one exchange and deliver it to a
warehouse of another exchange where he had sold an equivalent
amount. The purpose of this strategy would be to capture a
temporary price discrepancy between the two exchanges.
   One officer at a metals firm in New York said that, in
general, metals merchants are against the idea of the
warehouses while producers and consumers of the metals are
for them. "The warehouses provide another source of supply
that provides competition to the metals merchants," he
explained.
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans: Analysts said they would be focusing
this week on whether soybean futures prices will continue the
downward slide initiated Friday by trend-following commodity
funds, analysts said. Based on figures released last week
showing a relatively large number of speculators owning
soybean and soybean oil and meal futures versus those who
sold contracts earlier in expectation of lower prices, the
funds rushed to sell soybean futures Friday. "They figured
that kind of bullish sentiment couldn't be sustained," said
Richard Loewy, president of AgResource Co. in Chicago. On
Friday, soybeans for July delivery dropped 16.75 cents a
bushel to close at $6.4375 a bushel in hectic trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Analysts said that if July beans drop
below roughly $6.30 to $6.35 a bushel, the level at which
prices have rebounded following similar downdrafts in recent
weeks, fund managers may continue to bail out of soybeans and
drive the price as low as $6 to $6.20. Commercial grain
dealers and processing firms remain bearish on soybean
futures prices. "There are plenty of beans out there," one
analyst said. Wheat futures prices may continue to slide this
week as well, following last Thursday's release of a
government crop report forecasting a winter wheat harvest
this year of 2.09 billion bushels, up 44% from last winter's
droughtstricken crop. In the wake of the report, wheat
futures for July delivery dipped 5.25 cents a bushel to close
at $3.44. Corn futures prices held up relatively well Friday
despite a larger-than-expected crop forecast for this year,
which was released Thursday. Expected strong demand is likely
to keep corn supplies tight this year. July corn futures
declined just 1.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.90 a bushel.
                                                                                                       

   Orange Juice: The shock waves of the freeze that hit
Florida orange groves in December apparently will continue
into summer. The Department of Agriculture, in its May
revision of Florida's current orange crop, on Thursday raised
its estimate of production and frozen concentrate yields from
April, but traders ignored the report and continued to buy
futures on Friday, pushing prices higher. The agency
projected orange output at 108.1 million boxes, five million
boxes more than its estimate of 103.1 million in April. A box
weighs 90 pounds. It raised its estimate of frozen
concentrate yields to 1.22 gallons a box from 1.21 gallons in
April. It increased its estimate of the Valencia orange crop
by five million boxes, to 40 million, which was higher than
industry expectations of two million to four million. At
first, the report was regarded as negative, but later traders
changed their minds, said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill
Lynch, New York. One reason is that processors already have
mostly shut down as they have processed almost all the crop.
It is believed that any further juice will be used in
chilled, rather than frozen form, she said. Other
price-supporting factors are that retail demand for frozen
concentrate remains strong and that Florida supplies have
begun to dwindle, Ms. Ganes said. Florida inventories of
concentrate, as of the week ended May 5, amounted to 91.8
million gallons, compared with 104.3 million on hand at this
time last year, she said. These factors, along with continued
inventory declines as the season progresses, indicate that
prices will continue to firm, Ms. Ganes said.
                                                                                                       

   Sugar: Traders will be watching to see if futures prices
will extend Friday's rally, which was prompted by active
Mexican buying of sugar on the world market, other indicated
world market demand and lower-than-expected exports from
Brazil. Mexico bought 100,000 tons of refined sugar Thursday,
bringing total purchases by that country last week to about
500,000 tons, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton, New York. In addition, she said, there was talk that
Romania was looking to buy 200,000 tons of sugar. Iran,
Syria, Kuwait and Jordan are also possible buyers, and have
been drawn into the market by the recent drop in prices, she
said. According to Ms. Kaul, there were reports of ethanol
rationing in Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third-largest city. The
ethanol is produced from Brazilian sugar cane. Brazil is
expected to soon announce its sugar export policy and how
much it will export during the 1990-91 season that will begin
June 1, she said. Industry estimates are that it will earmark
about 750,000 tons for export, down from one million tons
exported during the current season, she said. Ms. Kaul
observed that the estimated export figure is regarded as
conservative, in view of expectations of a bigger Brazilian
sugar crop this year than last and with the freedom to export
that has come about because of the abolition of the
government sugar and alcohol agency by the new Brazilian
administration. Separately, C. Czarnikow Ltd., a London-based
sugar firm, on Friday estimated that world production of
sugar during the current, 1989-90 season ending Aug. 31 will
fall short of consumption by 1.85 million tons -- sharply
higher than an estimate by another British firm, E.D.&amp; F. Man
(Sugar) Ltd. on May 4, which said the shortfall would be only
258,000 tons. Man had drastically lowered its shortfall
projection from revision from 1.46 million tons in January.
                                                                                                       

   Energy: A negative factor for prices this week was news
that Texaco Inc. restarted its pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico
after closing it down early last week when a leak was
discovered in the system. Only 900 barrels of crude had
seeped into the water from the pipeline system, which carries
95,000 barrels of oil daily to refineries along the Gulf
Coast. The faulty section of the line, which was owned by
Exxon Corp., has been disconnected. Crude oil prices edged
lower in light trading Friday, led downward by declining
gasoline prices. The June delivery was down seven cents a
barrel to $18.95. June gasoline was down 1.79 cents a gallon
to 61.89 cents. Spot purchases of gasoline along the Gulf had
helped to prop up oil prices earlier in the week, but the
pace of those purchases had abated somewhat by week's end.

   Artel Communications Corp. said it expects to report
second-quarter revenue that is "significantly" lower than
"might have been expected."
   Artel added that it doesn't expect to report a profit for
the quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Hudson, Mass., maker of fiber optic communications
systems attributed the lower revenue to delays in U.S. and
European government programs, lower sales to Pacific Rim
customers and a longer-than-expected purchasing approval
process among some new customers.
   In the second quarter ended July 1, 1989, the company
earned $281,000, or seven cents a share, on revenue of $2.8
million.
   Artel said it has "implemented cost-containment actions
while maintaining the ongoing product development programs."
The company added that it expects to make "significant" new
product announcements by year end.

   KINGSVILLE, Texas -- President Bush set a goal of putting
an American on Mars in 30 years.
   Mr. Bush had previously endorsed a manned mission to Mars,
but hadn't embraced the goal of accomplishing the job in 30
years. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration already had been discussing a timetable of
roughly 30 years, however.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bush, who is busy trying to begin negotiations with
Congress to cut the federal budget deficit, didn't say how
much he thinks it will cost to reach Mars in that time.
   The president declared his goal in a commencement address
here at Texas A&amp;M University. Noting that 20 years have
passed since the first Apollo mission to the moon, Mr. Bush
declared: "Thirty years from now I believe man will stand on
another planet. . . . I believe that before Apollo celebrates
the 50th anniversary of its landing on the moon, the American
flag should be planted on Mars."

   The former executive cooperated with the Justice

   The three men said they arranged in 1988 for Norden to pay
defense consultant Thomas Muldoon $49,500 to get information
about the Navy's contract competition from his contacts in
the Defense Department.
   Mr. Muldoon was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined

   Warner-Lambert Co. is seeking to invalidate a doctor's
patent on the controversial drug THA, a treatment for
Alzheimer's disease that it hopes to begin marketing soon.
   The Morris Plains, N.J., drug company, in a petition filed
in federal court in Los Angeles, alleged that psychiatrist
William K. Summers, who holds a patent on the drug, failed to
disclose prior research in the area when he applied for the
patent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a result, Warner-Lambert contends that the patent is
invalid and that Dr. Summers, of Arcadia, Calif., should be
enjoined from suing the company for patent infringement.
   According to the petition, Warner-Lambert had been
negotiating with Dr. Summers for a patent license when the
talks broke off with a threat of a lawsuit by Dr. Summers.
Dr. Summers then allegedly sent licensing proposals to 82
other drug companies, disparaging Warner-Lambert's rights to
the treatment.
   Yesterday, Dr. Summers couldn't be reached for comment.
   Warner-Lambert said it has conducted extensive research on
THA and plans to market it. The drug has been the subject of
controversy for years over its effectiveness and possible
side effects. The company has said it expects the Food and
Drug Administration to approve sale of the drug.

   Source Perrier S.A. said consolidated net income fell 74%
to 266 million francs ($48.2 million) in 1989 from the year
earlier's unusually high level of 1.03 billion francs.
   The French mineral-water group's widely anticipated
earnings plunge largely reflected its much-publicized
problems with benzene content in its Perrier mineral water
and a subsequent world-wide recall of the product. At the
same time, it recorded a marked decline in non-recurring
gains from asset sales that had significantly boosted its
1988 results.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The cost of the recall, which was outlined in the group's
1989 accounts even though it was incurred in February 1990,
was 435 million francs. Perrier has expected to cover most of
these costs with non-recurring gains from the sale of
non-strategic assets, but these totaled only 254 million
francs for 1989.
   Excluding the non-recurring factors, Perrier said that its
operating profit for 1989 was 1.41 billion francs ($255.8
million), up 21% from a year earlier. Revenue climbed 11% to
17.19 billion francs during the same period.

North America.
   Pretax profit hardened to #366 million ($614.7 million) on

of #348 million and sales of #4.55 billion in the comparable
period. The figures were in line with analysts' expectations.

   Interest charges, which more than doubled to #82 million
as borrowings increased to finance acquisitions, ate into
Unilever's profit. Profit after tax and minority interests
firmed 13% to #221 million from #195 million in the first
quarter of 1989. Earnings per share jumped to 12.3 pence a
share from 10.4 pence, a gain of 18%.
   On the Amsterdam stock exchange, investors bid up Unilever
to a high of 144.50 guilders a share Friday before it closed

   ATLANTA -- Georgia-Pacific Corp. said William R. Laidig,
63 years old, resigned as chairman of Great Northern Nekoosa
Corp., which Georgia-Pacific acquired earlier this year after
a protracted takeover battle.
   The forest-products concern said Mr. Laidig will receive
more than $2.4 million for his resignation, as a result of
the severance clause in his employment contract. That
agreement guaranteed Great Northern's senior executives that
they would get three times their salaries if Great Northern
was taken over. Mr. Laidig's cash compensation in 1989 was
$801,000. The agreement also assured Mr. Laidig that, upon
his resignation, he would receive three times the amount of
his highest annual noncash bonus, but a Georgia-Pacific
spokeswoman could not ascertain that amount on Friday.

   Georgia-Pacific said Ronald P. Hogan, 49, Great Northern's
vice chairman and Georgia-Pacific's president and chief
operating officer, will succeed Mr. Laidig. Georgia-Pacific
said A.D. "Pete" Correll, 49, Georgia-Pacific's executive
vice president, pulp and paper, will continue as Great
Northern's president and chief executive officer.

   International -- Washington Insight:
   Whispers of a Soviet-German Concord
   Are Heard Under Kremlin's Grumbling

   WASHINGTON -- Despite Moscow's grumbling about reunifying
Germany, there are signs of a budding Soviet-German concord
in the wind.
   U.S. officials privately predict that the emerging
economic ties between the two countries will temper Soviet
opposition to German unification. But the Soviet Union and
Germany also are finding common ground on political and
strategic issues -- a development that could threaten
Washington's hopes of keeping Germany firmly in the Western
orbit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The potential bond between Europe's two strongest powers
is likely to be built on an economic foundation. "The Soviets
need Germany economically," said one top Bush administration
policy-maker, who reviewed the recent opening round of
six-power talks on German unification.
   "They depended on East Germany for so much," he said, "and
they're going to need united Germany to continue that trade.
Plus they need new investment from Germany. So they're not
likely to want to be viewed as the only power blocking German
unification."
   Others agree. "The Soviet Union's largest East European
trading partner is East Germany, its largest Western trading
partner is West Germany," says Charles Gati, a specialist on
Soviet-East European affairs at Union College and author of a
new book on the subject. "So you can just imagine the
economic stakes the Soviet Union has with the new Germany."
   Adds former State Department official Robert Hormats, now
with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., "The economic relationship with
Germany is Gorbachev's ace in the hole. In the final unity
deal, he can extract economic concessions from the Germans."
   Signs of such a potential trade-off were sprinkled through
an otherwise negative Soviet performance at the unity talks,
which are formally called the "Two-Plus-Four" negotiations.
Shortly before laying down strong private objections to
German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and making other demands, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze held a long, cordial meeting with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss bilateral relations,
including economic ties.
   Mr. Shevardnadze said he and Mr. Kohl had "noted that the
potential for cooperation between our two countries is as yet
not fully exhausted. There are great reserves. There's a
great deal yet to be done, and we discussed ways of making
use of, of drawing on those reserves."
   The Soviet foreign minister also refused to restate on
West German television the strong Soviet objections to German
membership in NATO, saying only that he was optimistic a
settlement could be reached. His aides distributed his tough
remarks, including a refusal to grant the new Germany full
sovereignty, only to Soviet and East German reporters.
   Mr. Kohl has pledged that the new Germany will honor
existing trade and contract commitments between the Soviets
and East Germany, a costly proposition for Germany, because
it could require maintaining production of some items to meet
Soviet specifications, even though they can't be sold in the
West.
   Last year in Bonn, Mr. Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev signed a "comprehensive economic collaboration"
stepping up trade and investment. An investment treaty has
been signed, Soviet executives are being trained in West
Germany, and German banks have set up a $1 billion credit
line for Soviet trade.
   "The Soviets realize that the united Germany has a growth
potential from which they can profit if they reform their
economy," says a German diplomat. "We've made that very clear
to them."
   But money, important as it is to the near-bankrupt
U.S.S.R., isn't the only tie that binds the two European
powers. Aware of Soviet security fears, German officials have
won U.S. support for a plan to keep NATO forces out of former
East German territory after unification. They have invited
the Red Army to remain in East German territory during a
transition period that could last seven years. The new
Germany will even pay for the troops.
   Most importantly, there is broad agreement between German
and Soviet leaders on the desirability of establishing some
new, vaguely defined Pan-European security system under the
auspices of the existing Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   This idea, which makes U.S. officials nervous, has wide
popular appeal and is embraced to varying degrees by all
political parties in both Germanys. So far, German leaders
insist the new system would complement, not replace, NATO.
But the Soviet strategy is to build on this romantic German
notion of a Pan-European security system and eventually drive
NATO out of business by replacing it with the new security
system.
   And despite the bitter legacy of World War II, there are
historic precedents for Russian-German cooperation. "When
they weren't fighting each other, the Russians have used the
Germans as advisers for years," says Mr. Hormats. "For
centuries, there has been a love-hate relationship between
Russia and Germany."

   Heard on the Street:
   Progressive Corp., an Insurer, Stands to Profit
   From Other Firms' Retreat From Car Coverage

   Many insurers are beating a hasty retreat from the auto
insurance market. But their departure could leave the market
wide open for Progressive Corp.
   Based in Cleveland, this property/casualty insurer
specializes in providing what is delicately known as
"nonstandard" auto insurance. This isn't the coverage for the
people who drive once a week, to church on Sunday. This is
for motorists most insurers avoid -- the ones with traffic
violations, accidents, even drunk-driving convictions on
their records. It's a group that includes young drivers,
especially men in their 20s, and motorists who drive
expensive sports cars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Major insurers such as Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, Travelers,
Cigna, Xerox's Crum &amp; Forster unit, and some regional
companies, are cutting back on the amount of auto insurance
they write or pulling out of the market altogether. With
their retreat, many drivers are left hunting for new
insurance carriers and so Progressive could end up taking on
a far better class of drivers, analysts say.
   Investors haven't fully appreciated "the change in the
nonstandard market. When that happens, this company can grow
like a weed," says Michael Takata at UBS Securities.
Progressive certainly thrived in the mid-1980s when auto
insurers racked up losses and market capacity shrank, he
recalls; the company's premiums, per-share earnings, book
value and stock prices quadrupled.
   Mr. Takata, who reiterated his buy recommendation on
Progressive recently, doesn't see the same degree of upside
potential this time. But "we could see a doubling of
(Progressive's) premiums and earnings," he says.
   The stock, which closed Friday at 38 1/8, currently sells
for just over nine times Mr. Takata's 1990 earnings estimate
of $4 a share. With annual earnings potential of $6 to $8 a
share and an uptick in the price/earnings multiple to 10 over
the next two years, he says, Progressive "would be a
$60-to-$80 stock. This is one of the few great growth stocks
in the insurance industry."
   Gerald Lewinsohn at Merrill Lynch says: "Anytime you can
buy a stock with (Progressive's earnings) record and rate of
return, and selling for a low P/E, it's a bargain."
   Insurers generally have lost money writing auto insurance
in the past decade, even though they tend to insure only what
they consider the safest drivers. At Progressive, though, net
income has grown at nearly a 15% average rate as return on
equity averaged 25.3% annually in the past 10 years -- nearly
12 points above the return of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index.
   Progressive's first-quarter earnings report, released last
month, turned heads on Wall Street. Per-share earnings of
$1.01 far exceeded analysts' expectations of 75 cents to 80
cents. (Many firms stopped following the stock closely when
the company discontinued analyst meetings in late 1988.)
   Tom Sargent at Conning &amp; Co. has been telling clients "it
makes sense to be buying the stock now." Although the stock
has appreciated some 48% in the past 15 months, the departure
of some insurers from the market presents tremendous
potential for the company, the stock's admirers say. William
Bitterli at Northington Partners believes the shares could
sell at 50 by year end.
   Since the late 1950s Progressive has collected a huge
amount of data on high-risk drivers. It "cherry-picks among
the bad risks," one analyst says. For example, when
Progressive learned that older, married motorcyclists are
better risks than most riders of big motorcycles, it
benefited by charging them less than rivals did.
   In California, where Progressive had more than 20% of its
business, the company has adopted an extremely conservative
strategy. It set aside $34 million last year and $13.9
million in the first quarter as reserves for possible premium
refunds that might be ordered under California's auto
insurance initiative, Proposition 103. The company has also
been reducing its business in the state as much as the
current insurance laws allow. Northington's Mr. Bitterli
believes these reserves aren't likely to be needed and could
be released into future earnings.
   Progessive's long-haul trucking insurance unit, which had
a loss in 1988 after a quick start two years earlier, is
thought by analysts to have broken even in this year's first
quarter after a restructuring last year. Progressive, which
took a big hit in the 1987 market crash, today has a $2
billion portfolio that is invested largely in short-term,
high-grade securities including some adjustable-rate bonds.
Only about $240 million is in the stock market.

   West German Economists Play Down
   Post-Reunification Inflation Threat

   FRANKFURT, West Germany (APDJ) -- Threats to West German
price stability due to reunification with East Germany are
being exaggerated, a growing number of West German economists
assert.
   A week after the two German governments agreed to terms of
monetary union, set to take effect July 2, and amid signals
that the two states could merge politically perhaps by the
end of the year, analysts are forecasting that inflation in
West Germany won't spurt to intolerable levels. Most expect
the cost of living to rise about 3%, little changed from last
year, and considerably below some pessimistic estimates of 4%
or more.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That optimism has carried over into currency markets,
where the West German mark has risen sharply against most
currencies in recent days and has approached its highest
levels against the dollar in two years. The dollar ended
trading in New York Friday at 1.6478, down sharply from
1.6840 marks the day before details of the currency union
were set.
   Economists cite the following for their optimism on
inflation:
   -- East Germans, who after July 2 will be able to convert
their approximately 170 billion East German marks in cash and
savings into about 120 billion West German marks ($72.44
billion), will be wary of depleting their savings in a buying
binge of consumer goods because of uncertainty about
employment.
   -- Should consumer demand, nevertheless, rise, much of it
could be met through increased imports, which analysts
describe as a desired side effect of the merger by countering
West Germany's massive trade surpluses.
   -- The mark remains strong, and shows little sign of
severe weakening against the dollar, which puts downward
pressure on import prices, especially prices of oil. That in
turn keeps producer prices low.
   "Inflation just isn't a necessary consequence of the
currency union," said Gabriel Andrade, an economist at Baring
Securities in Frankfurt. "The Bundesbank can absorb excess
money supply. The continuation of the Deutsche mark's
strength makes it also likely that inflationary tendencies
can be kept under control."
   The Bundesbank, which raised interest rates four times in
1989 to slow inflation that was surging well above 3% at
times last year, warned in the weeks before the currency
union agreement that it would slam its foot on the monetary
brake if costs for the unification of the two German states
appeared to threaten domestic price stability.
   This, in turn, contributed to a slump in the West German
bond market and left currency markets wary.
   And even though the Bundesbank's suggestion for 2,000
marks being converted at the favorable 1-to-1 rate was
eschewed for the final 4,000 marks swapped at par for Germans
between the ages of 15 and 60, the central bank has quietly
indicated the final agreement isn't far from what it had in
mind. East Germans 60 and older may swap 6,000 marks into
West German marks and those 14 and younger may convert 2,000
marks.
   "The exchange rate they settled on is a lot less than some
people feared," said Ulrich Schroeder, an economist at
Deutsche Bank. He expects inflation to end the year not much
above 3%.
   "The economists abroad who are talking about higher
inflation are overlooking the fact that East Germans have to
save for their old age. And a lot of that will stay in
savings," Schroeder continued, noting that East Germans save
an average of 7% of their income compared with a 12% savings
rate in West Germany.
   "People in East Germany are also acutely afraid of
becoming unemployed," he said, referring to some estimates of
unemployment, previously unheard of, jumping to 15% or more
within two years. "They aren't going to spend all their
savings in times of uncertainty like this."
   But other economists worry about what they call a "glacier
of liquidity" in East Germany, not knowing if, or how much of
that "will melt," as Jonathan Hoffman of Credit Suisse First
Boston in London describes it. Hoffman and others say they're
nervous about a larger number of marks chasing the same
amount of goods.
   Skeptics add that there is enormous pent-up demand for
consumer goods among East Germans. According to research
compiled by Andrade and Norbert Braems, chief economist at
Baring Securities in Frankfurt, East Germans have had to pay
more that double in real terms what West Germans pay for
cars, more than triple for color television sets, almost
quadruple for refrigerators and six times as much for
cassette recorders.
   Also cited by those who see a jump in inflation coming is
the enormous pressure on capacity in such sectors as the
construction industry, as billions of marks are poured into
rebuilding the decayed East German infrastructure.
   West German analysts generally tend to see a rosier
scenario. Andrade reckons that demand for between 600 billion
marks to 800 billion marks in investment needed in East
Germany over the next 10 years can come from a mixture of
corporate, private and state funds.
   From the state, Andrade said some 40 billion marks in
subsidies Bonn currently provides to West Berlin and other
previously isolated border regions can be diverted into East
Germany. Another 10 billion marks can be saved by a 20% cut
in arms spending in West Germany. And, while it's politically
unlikely before general elections in December, a 1% increase
in value-added tax could generate another 10 billion marks.
   Economists in West Germany don't expect East Germans to
pass up investment opportunites they previously didn't have.
"Other than simple savings accounts, there was nothing," said
Schroeder of Deutsche Bank. "There were no stocks, no bonds,
nothing. It's completely wrong to say that the 120 billion
D-marks will be liquid. A large part of that is what people
are saving for old age."
   Heiner Flassbeck, an economist at the independent DIW
Institute for economic research in West Berlin, doesn't see
an acceleration in inflation because of the currency union.
Inflation in 1989, he predicts, will probably settle
somewhere just above 3.0% and well below 3.5%.
   "The arguments that stronger demand will push prices up
are overlooking the fact that this isn't a closed market," he
said. "There's an entire world market that can help meet any
increase in demand. And that would lead to lower German trade
surpluses, which isn't an undesired effect. There's not going
to be a shortage of supply."

   Cie. Generale d'Electricite (CGE) said its consolidated
revenue edged up 1% in the first quarter to 32.70 billion
francs ($5.92 billion) from 32.42 billion francs ($5.87
billion) a year earlier.
   The French electronics, telecommunications and engineering
group said that the relatively flat sales performance was
strongly influenced by changes in group structure, the most
notable of which was its decision in 1989 to create GEC
Alsthom N.V., a joint unit with General Electric Co. of
Britain in the field of power distribution and engineering.
CGE said that first-quarter revenue would have been up 7%
from a year earlier after adjustment for this and other
changes in group structure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New orders taken during the first quarter totaled 38.5
billion francs, CGE said, up 16% from a year earlier.
   CGE didn't provide comparable first-quarter earnings
figures. For all of 1989, its consolidated net profit after
payments to minority interests was 4.94 billion francs on
revenue of 143.9 billion francs.

   BRASILIA -- Brazil lifted a ban that prevented foreign
multinational companies from remitting profits, dividends or
capital abroad. But remittances that are already frozen will
remain so for 16 months, the central bank said.
   "In the future, those operations won't be subject to
compulsory deposit in the central bank, and companies here
can freely remit resources to their parent firms," central
bank spokesman Pedro Kleiberg said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ban on capital remittances was announced July 3, 1989,
to protect the country's dwindling hard-currency reserves.
   Mr. Kleiberg said the measure applies only to future
operations. The money now on deposit at the central bank --
estimated at about $1 billion -- will be released in 12 equal
monthly installments starting Sept. 16, 1991, he said.
   Separately, Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello said
inflation in April was close to 3% a month, and not zero as
the government had predicted.
   Mrs. Cardoso de Mello told senators on Thursday that
President Fernando Collor de Mello's anti-inflation program
called for a drop in inflation to around 10% a month in 100
days.
   "We managed to knock inflation down to 3% in 40 days," she
said. The official inflation rate is to be announced
tomorrow.

   GUNMEN KILLED two U.S. airmen in the Philippines on the
eve of base talks.
   As the U.S. and the Philippines prepared to open
negotiations today on extending the leases on six American
military bases, authorities said suspected leftist guerrillas
killed the two servicemen near Clark Air Base, about 50 miles
north of Manila. The assailants escaped, and there wasn't any
immediate claim of responsibility. But the area near Clark
has been a communist stronghold since the 1940s. The Air
Force ordered all troops back to base, and those living
off-base were restricted to quarters.

   Cellular Phones Call for Careful Shopping

   Cellular phones may no longer cost as much as a Caribbean
vacation, but they're still pricey enough that buyers can
benefit from serious comparison shopping.
   Basic models that cost $4,000 just a few years ago now
average about $400. Some portables can be purchased for less
than $100 during special promotions. And smart shoppers can
get a lot of extras thrown in for free, such as speaker
phones, hold buttons and call-forwarding systems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still shoppers would be wise to look beyond the price tag.
Retailers frequently offer deep discounts on equipment -- but
with a catch: The buyer must sign a contract with a
cellular-phone service. The contracts, which range from 60
days to over three years, often allow retailers to sell
equipment at below the manufacturer's price. But a bargain
phone isn't a good deal if it means signing your phone life
away to the devil.
   "The last thing a person wants to be stuck with is lousy
service and outrageous rates," warns David Rosenberg, a
consultant in Dallas.
   Cellular phones also can be purchased directly from
service companies. The service companies often offer
low-priced equipment, free installation and antennae and
features such as traffic-report services and stock hotlines
for no extra charge. Periodically, the companies even give
away cellular phones or have two-for-one specials.
   Sometimes, it pays to wait. Motorola's pocket telephone
cost about $3,500 when it was introduced last year. But
already the price on the wallet-sized set has tumbled to
about $1,300. One loaded with all the latest gizmos costs
about $1,800.
   Buyers should evaluate special features on the equipment,
especially because many "extras" are often standard. Speaker
phones in cars are recommended as a safety feature by the
American Automobile Association because they allow
"hands-free" talking. About the size of a quarter and mounted
on the rear-view mirror, the microphone lets the driver talk
and steer at the same time.
   Other features may cost extra up front, but save money
down the road. Among them is the electronic lock. With
cellular service so expensive, it's not a bad idea to keep
other people from gabbing on your line. Electronic locks have
number codes that, when dialed, prevent the phone from being
used. Likewise, call timers can slow the dollar drain by
keeping track of how long you've been talking.
   Buyers of car phones should always inquire about
installation. Some companies install for free, while others
charge anywhere from $50 to $200. Cellular telephones come in
three parts -- a receiver that's bolted into the car trunk,
an exterior antenna and an interior telephone unit. For best
reception, an antenna should be placed on the car roof. But
some buyers opt to put the antenna in the trunk for aesthetic
reasons. Cellular service companies warn against putting
antennae on the window because reception tends to be poor,
and the gear can fall off in a car wash.
   Cellular subscribers should carefully scrutinize service
carriers. In each city, two cellular service companies are
licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, but there
are also numerous other companies that sell the service as
agents or resellers. Like companies that resell long-distance
telephone service, cellular agents generally have lower
monthly fees and provide innovative rate packages.
   Carol Segal, a Detroit consultant, managed to obtain a
cellular service contract that has a monthly access fee of
only $8 a month, plus the per-minute charge. Cellular
carriers can charge access fees as high as $70 a month. "If I
only make two calls a month, it doesn't make sense to pay
more than $8 a month," she explains.

   White House
   Says It's Sincere

   Bush, Aides Try to Reassure
   Democrats That a Trap
   Isn't Being Set on Taxes

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush and his top aides sought to
reassure Democrats that the administration is sincere about
negotiating a compromise to shrink the swelling federal
deficit.
   Mr. Bush, Chief of Staff John Sununu and Budget Director
Richard Darman attempted to repair the damage Mr. Sununu did
last week when he told reporters that Democrats could propose
taxes, but that the White House would reject them. All three
sought to return to previous declarations that the bipartisan
talks begin tomorrow with "no preconditions."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Sununu was more cautious yesterday, saying on NBC's
"Meet the Press" that "The White House would be likely to
look askance" at taxes. He displayed a modicum of flexibility
by noting that the administration finds some "user fees and
other revenue raisers" more acceptable than others.
   And, given the opportunity on several occasions during his
television appearance, Mr. Sununu declined to repeat the
president's no-new-taxes campaign pledge.
   Democrats are proceeding with the talks, but with great
wariness that the administration is setting a trap to blame
them for the tax increases that are certain to be part of any
significant deficit-reduction package. With each side
insisting publicly that the other be the first to propose any
tax increases, the talks could bog down. But the point of
closed-door bargaining is to find a way to share the blame
for an unpopular combination of spending cuts and tax
increases. Accused by one reporter yesterday of being
deliberately vague, Mr. Darman said, "That's constructive."
   "The tricky part is getting all of the parties to get from
where they are right at the moment to what they might agree
on without getting themselves in such an argument that the
thing falls through," Mr. Darman said on ABC's "This Week
with David Brinkley."
   Mr. Bush sought out reporters aboard Air Force One on
Friday in an acknowledged attempt to restore Democrats'
confidence in his good faith. "I made this proposal that we
meet with no conditions, and that's exactly the way it's
going to be." He wouldn't talk about his willingness or lack
thereof to accept tax increases. "I'm not going to show you
my hand," he said.
   Dismissing suggestions that Mr. Sununu might be in trouble
for roiling the waters before negotiations began, Mr. Bush
insisted it is "silly . . . stupid" to suggest his chief of
staff is in hot water. The president expects more flaps over
the tax question before the negotiations are concluded.
"Tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave, so keep your
snorkel above the water level and do what you think is
right," he said.
   Democrats seemed prepared to accept Mr. Bush's assurances.
Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas),
accompanying Mr. Bush on his flight to Texas, said that the
budget summit is "back on track -- as long as we keep these
fellows in line who are trying to redefine it."
   But Mr. Sununu once again ruffled feathers on Capitol
Hill, asserting yesterday on NBC that the catalyst for the
president's invitation to talk isn't so much the economy, but
the inadequacies of Congress. Acknowledging that Mr. Bush's
budget plan isn't sufficient, Mr. Sununu complained that "the
failure of Congress to do any constructive revision . . .
since the president sent it up is part of the problem we
have."
   In response, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser
(D., Tenn.) said, "The chief of staff is off base once
again." He suggested pointedly that Mr. Sununu leave
negotiating to Mr. Bush and Mr. Darman.
   Mr. Darman said that negotiators should aim at a package
to cut the deficit by between $45 billion and $55 billion --
even though he said meeting deficit targets set by the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law would require between $50
billion and $100 billion in cuts, or "over $100 billion" if
all the spending on the thrift industry bailout is included.
Part of any agreement is likely to be the exclusion of thrift
spending from the Gramm-Rudman calculations.
   The Gramm-Rudman law sets a deficit target of $64 billion
for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. If Congress and the
president fail to reach a compromise, deep across-the-board
spending cuts will be triggered in October.

   CONCORD, Mass. -- T.H.E. Group Inc. said the Ohio

   The company said that the Ohio department alleges that the
unit doesn't meet minimum surplus requirements under Ohio

adequately complied with those conditions and is now
contesting" the department's complaint.

   Separately, T.H.E. Group said it has received inquiries

ago. The company said it hasn't filed the report because it
hasn't completed certain audit procedures, some of which are
related to its Ohio unit and its dispute with the Ohio
department. The company added that it is uncertain when it
will file its 10-K.
   T.H.E. Group said "third parties" have indicated "in
principle their willingness" to buy its Ohio unit and the
other insurance units of the holding company. The sales, if
completed, "are expected to be at not less than {the units'}
carrying value" on its books, the company said. After
completion of the sales, the company would retain interest in
a Texas-based insurance company and certain other assets,
including a retail sporting goods store, a spokeswoman said.
   The company said it has taken steps to cut its expenses,
including the sale of its Forum Re Finance unit to an
affiliate for the redemption of a $5 million secured
debenture. The company said it expects to recognize a gain of
more than $2 million from the sale. Additionally, T.H.E.
Group said it purchased and retired $5.1 million of its
Series B preferred shares from an affiliate.

   LONDON -- Britain's retail price index rose 3% in April
from March and was up 9.4% from April 1989, the Central
Statistical Office said.
   The 3% monthly rise was the largest since April 1980, when
the index was up 3.4%.

   DETROIT -- U.S. auto makers are planning sizable
production increases for the third quarter, reflecting
forecasts of stronger buyer demand and fears of a labor
strike in September.
   Individuals in the industry say U.S. auto makers are
planning to build more than 1.5 million cars in the third
quarter, up 11% from last year. The individuals say the auto
makers also intend to increase truck production by 6%, to
887,009 vehicles, during that period.

   But the 10 companies that build cars in the U.S. aren't
throwing caution to the wind. On Friday, Ford Motor Co. said
it will close its Chicago auto-assembly plant for one week
beginning today because of a shortage of dealer orders.
   Although inventories of the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable
models built there are slightly below normal, Ford said it
intends to be cautious regarding vehicle inventories in light
of sluggish spring sales. In all, the company has cut
second-quarter car production by 25,000 vehicles during the
past month.
   Overall, auto makers are planning to build nearly 1.8
million cars in the second quarter, down 9% from a year ago.
Production of trucks -- including vans -- is running about
even with last year.
   Although second-quarter production trails that of last
year, it is far better than the first quarter, when auto
makers built 21% fewer cars and trucks than in 1989. Analysts
say the more ambitious production plans for the second and
third quarters, combined with lower consumer incentives, will
help the Big Three auto makers record profits better than in
their dismal first quarter.
   "Despite a horrible first quarter of earnings, the outlook
of the Big Three is fairly positive for the rest of the
year," says John Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp;
Co.
   Lower inventories have helped auto makers reduce the cash
back and financing incentives they offer to buyers. General
Motors Corp. and Ford have reduced their incentives by an
average of about $200 a vehicle during the past month,
according to Scott Merlis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co. Mr. Merlis says the auto makers can afford to reduce
incentives because inventory levels are modest. Ford, for
example, has a 61-day supply of cars and a 63-day supply of
trucks, both of which are normal.
   Some car dealers say production cuts might have gone too
far. Steven Fish, general manager of Freeway Dodge in
Bloomington, Minn., said he has a pretty good stock of trucks
and vans but is low on Dodge Daytonas, Shadows, and Spirits.
"I'm supposed to have 20 or 30 of each but I only have two or
three of each," he said, noting that Chrysler Corp. has been
heavily advertising these models. "I could have sold more if
I had more."
   While this accounts for part of the increase in
third-quarter production plans, there is another reason as
well. Auto makers may be stepping up production to hedge
against a possible strike in September, when their labor
contracts with the United Auto Workers union expires.
   "You have to take into consideration dealing with the UAW
this fall," says Edward Sullivan, an analyst with WEFA Group,
in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. The big union represents some 450,000
workers, who could cripple production by any of the companies
they would choose to strike.
   Currently, seven of the nine U.S. auto makers who were
building cars a year ago are planning production boosts in
the third quarter. Chrysler's production will be lower,
largely because it stopped building its Dodge Omni and
Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars last fall.
   Nissan Motor Corp. will build fewer cars, but is
delegating more of its capacity to trucks in the third
quarter. Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. wasn't building
vehicles a year ago.

   Shaky Dollar May Be Hammered Down
   By More Heavy Sales, Many Traders Say

   NEW YORK -- The already-shaky dollar may be hammered down
by more heavy sales in the near term, many traders say.
   Because of the yen's sudden revitalization and renewed
speculation that U.S. interest rates are headed lower,
"Market sentiment has changed. The dollar should be the
weakest" currency rather than one of the strongest, says
Shigeru Tokunaga, foreign exchange manager at Fuji Bank Ltd.,
New York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Late Friday here, the dollar was quoted at 152.65 yen,
having dropped steeply from 156.70 at Thursday's close.
Against the mark, however, the dollar was quoted at 1.6478
late Friday, up from 1.6285.
   In trading in Tokyo Monday, the U.S. currency opened at
152.45 yen, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 154.15 yen.
   The dollar's 2.6% plunge against the yen Friday -- one of
the severest setbacks it has undergone in the past 16 months
while strengthening more than 25% against the Japanese
currency -- was a pivotal development for a number of
reasons.
   The drop marked the dollar's breakout from its recent
trading range of 156 to 160 yen and has left the dollar
dangerously close to an important psychological support at
150 yen, traders say.
   Moreover, there is evidence that Japanese investors at
life insurance companies, trust funds and other institutions
are getting nervous about holding dollars.
   While the dollar-yen is one of the most actively traded
exchange rates in global dealings, powerful Japanese
institutions sometimes have a big influence on the dollar's
level. The dollar's arrival at a 39-month peak of 160.30 yen
in early April was attributed largely to long-term position
adjustments by institutional investors who hadn't anticipated
such a strong rise this year.
   Much of the dollar's losses against the yen were
registered in Tokyo Friday, where there was a mad rush to
dump the currency. Tokyo foreign exchange brokers reported a
total spot transaction turnover of $21.58 billion, the
highest ever seen in Japan.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 154.15 yen, the lowest
finish since 153.65 on March 20.
   Institutional investors were spotted selling the dollar
aggressively after its support around 156 yen crumbled,
apparently moving to limit losses on positions in the
currency options market.
   Some institutions previously had written options to sell
dollars at levels of 157 yen and higher as part of a strategy
that would have succeeded if the dollar had traded as
anticipated in a range of 156 to 160 yen; they were caught
off guard when the floor fell out from under the dollar
Friday, market participants say.
   If an institution had to buy dollars at, say, 154 yen to
fulfill an option being exercised at 157 yen, it would incur
losses of three yen less the premium gained from the option
sale.
   Options to sell dollars, called puts, gives the owner the
right, but not the obligation, to sell the dollar at a
specified level in a set time frame. If the dollar falls
below the pinpointed price before the expiration, the put
holder may reap profits from the exercise of the contract.
   While it is hard to predict exactly what tactics Japanese
institutions and other market participants will use in the
near future, more dollar losses against the yen may be in
store, traders say.
   "We'll probably continue to see dollar selling on
rallies," says Linda McLaughlin, a trader at Chemical Bank.
She sees resistance at 154.50 yen as a roadblock that will
probably make it hard for the dollar to rebound in the short
run.
   It is too soon to say that the yen has bottomed for sure
after its lengthy slump, but the mood about it has clearly
changed sharply. Only a few months ago the yen was caught in
a downward spiral because of the hard times that Japan's
stock and bond markets went through and Japan's relatively
low interest rates.
   And while the situation has turned against the dollar, the
U.S. currency may show some buoyancy if the yen remains weak
against the mark and the Swiss franc in cross-trading,
traders say.
   The yen underwent strong upward corrections against those
Western European currencies Friday, but the gains may be
short-lived.
   Late Friday in New York, the mark was quoted at 92.639 yen
and the Swiss franc traded at 109.075 yen, down sharply from
96.224 and 112.896, respectively, at Thursday's close.
   Eventually, the dollar may fall swiftly against all major
foreign currencies if the Federal Reserve loosens its
monetary policy, traders say.
   Speculation about Fed easing continues to grow because of
more evidence of slower growth and lessening inflation.
   In April, retail sales fell 0.6%, the sharpest decrease
since October 1989, after falling 0.2% in March. The producer
price index declined 0.3% last month after dropping 0.2% in
March.
   Those data follow news about last month's unexpectedly
weak employment data.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $368.80 an ounce, down $1.30.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.2 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $367 an ounce.

   American policy toward Indochina was pretty much swept
under the national rug with the fall of Saigon, but the
beginnings of a new debate have been stirred by the ongoing
controversy over an ABC News documentary on Cambodia. For the
latest installment in TV criticism see the accompanying
letter by Stephen Morris and the editorial below (See:
Letters to the Editor:  Cambodia vs. Vietnam's Colonialism
and Review &amp; Outlook (Editorial): ABC's Documentary -- WSJ
May 14, 1990). But to think about Cambodian policy, start by
recalling that this is not a conflict that conveniently pits
bad guys against good guys. There are communist forces on
both sides.
   The Khmer Rouge, the communists who took over Cambodia
when America lost in Vietnam, are currently waging a
guerrilla war against the Hanoi-backed government in Phnom
Penh. Before being evicted from power by the Vietnamese, they
compiled a ghastly record, and they would probably wreak
further horrors given the chance. It's also true that the two
non-communist resistance factions are an unpromising lot,
likely to lose out to their erstwhile allies, the Khmer
Rouge, in a grab for Phnom Penh.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The non-communists -- who do receive aid from the U.S. --
are renowned for their corruption, especially in their own
camps. They are headed by Prince Sihanouk, who has never
shown himself much of a friend to the West. Indeed, before
Sihanouk's falling out with the Vietnamese, he produced such
effusions as "My War With the CIA," a memoir in which he
detailed his dealings with Hanoi and the communist factions
that eventually helped topple the dominoes of Laos and
Cambodia.
   It is entirely possible, though, that the Khmer Rouge
stand a good chance of retaking Cambodia with or without the
efforts of the non-communist resistance. In our own inquiries
in Thailand and the Far East generally we have never heard of
any proof that the U.S. provides direct military aid to the
Khmer Rouge. It is of course true that both the
non-communists and the Khmer Rouge are fighting the same
enemy, and it is probably true that the Khmer Rouge -- with
their better organization, superior numbers and clearer goals
-- would probably swallow up the other resistance factions in
the end.
   The odd leap made by many commentators, however, is that
if the U.S. doesn't go on backing the Cambodian resistance,
it should start backing the Vietnamese-installed regime of
Hun Sen in Cambodia as well as Vietnam's government in Hanoi.
But both the Phnom Penh and the Hanoi regimes are still
ruthless governments (see Amnesty International's report on
Vietnam, February 1990).
   Indeed, as Mr. Morris points out, a major reason the Khmer
Rouge are able to gather any support inside Cambodia is that
they play to the hatred with which many Cambodians regard
their Vietnamese overlords. The Khmer Rouge may indeed have
captured the powerful force of nationalism, unless the
non-communist resistance is more viable than it looks.
   Vietnam last September put on a show of pulling its troops
out of Cambodia. But journalists who have traveled in
Cambodia and Western diplomats in Bangkok say there is clear
evidence that Vietnamese troops have since returned to
Cambodia -- if indeed they ever left -- to support the Hun
Sen government which most Cambodians hate.
   Even institutions as eager to return to Vietnam as the
Asian Development Bank have had to back off on Hanoi's word
that it is out of Cambodia. A source at the ADB tells us that
it had laid the ground for renewal of aid to Vietnam pending
withdrawal from Cambodia; last September its then-president,
Masao Fujioka, had the Bank put together a confidential
report on the Vietnamese economy and then went there himself.
But aid resumption was put on hold because there was too much
reason to believe the withdrawal was bogus.
   Also, there are reports leaking out of Laos these past few
months that the Lao government -- possibly with Vietnamese or
even Soviet backing -- has been using chemical warfare
against resistance fighters along the Thai-Lao border, and
against rebellious civilians further inside Laos, around the
Plain of Jars. Surely such reports should at least be
investigated before the U.S. decides to place its trust in
Vietnam, or provide anything in the way of aid or recognition
to Hanoi.
   Vietnam keeps trying to present itself to the West as a
sort of Third World waif. But Hanoi's politburo runs a huge
army equipped with Soviet weapons, and it plays host to a
huge Soviet base at Cam Ranh Bay and an airfield at Da Nang.
This does not reflect a harmless Vietnam.
   With regard to Cambodia, this leaves U.S. policy makers in
a painful dilemma. Should they send enough aid to keep the
non-communist resistance alive, hoping for the kind of
long-shot lurch we've seen in other parts of the world
lately? It's worth noting that there indeed has been talk of
holding a U.N.-sponsored election in Cambodia. Or should the
U.S. abandon the non-communists to their fate, to avoid
indirect help to one side or the other in the struggle
between the Khmer Rouge and Hanoi? Our view is that as a
matter of morality, the U.S. should aid non-communists
willing to fight. But as a matter of realpolitik, we suspect
that the Cambodian non-communists are simply too weak.
   America's mission is certainly not to sort out the
quarrels of two vile and competing communist groups. The
wisest course at this juncture is for the U.S. to send the
basic messages that we oppose communism and where possible we
actively support freedom. This would mean, for instance,
taking more Vietnamese refugees into the U.S.
   The bottom line is, having lost the war in Indochina, the
U.S. doesn't have enough clout right now to sway any outcome
in Cambodia. In all likelihood it will have to wait, as it
did in Eastern Europe, until a decent and geniune option
somehow manages to arise from the awful brew that began with
the arrival of communism in Southeast Asia.

Group Inc., which is based in Fort Lee, N.J., said its net
liabilities as of March 30 were $504.5 million. Its total
assets at that date were $587.3 million, including $558
million owed to the unit by the parent company. DBL Trading,
which is no longer doing business, said those are the latest
figures available.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Creditors of DBL Trading on Wednesday filed an involuntary
bankruptcy petition to force the unit to liquidate. The
Drexel unit's filing said that Nissho Iwai Corp., a major
Japanese trading company, is owed $173.4 million, making it
the largest creditor yet to emerge in the Drexel bankruptcy
case. John Jerome, an attorney for Nissho Iwai, said the debt
is from gold and platinum transactions. He said Nissho Iwai
has a guarantee from the Drexel parent company for the claim.
   The Drexel parent company filed under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code in February and is liquidating all of
its operations. In federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan,
Judge Howard Buschman III also converted DBL Trading's
bankruptcy case to Chapter 11, under which the debtor remains
in control of the company.
   Mr. Jerome said Nissho Iwai has no objections to the case
being handled under Chapter 11.
   According to the court filing, the other major unsecured
creditors of DBL Trading are the central bank of Portugal,
which is owed $93.9 million; the central bank of Yugoslavia,
$71.9 million; the central bank of Malaysia, $42.2 million;
Ultramar Energy Ltd. of Tarrytown, N.Y., $10.8 million; the
central bank of Poland, $10.6 million; CNCA HK, an affiliate
of Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole of France, $10.5
million; Al Baraka Investment Co. of London, $5.6 million;
State Saving Bank of Warsaw, $4.8 million; and CRT Energy
Ltd. of Chicago, $1.9 million. Some of the amounts may vary
as exchange rates change.
   Most of the debt involves precious-metals transactions, an
attorney familiar with the case said. Some of the central
banks leased small portions of their gold reserves to DBL
Trading, which paid the foreign countries interest on the
gold while investing it in other transactions. Some of the
money owed to foreign central banks involves foreign currency
transactions.

   Ex-Im Bank to Expand Loans to Poles;
   Bush Sets Other East Bloc Initiatives

   COLUMBIA, S.C. -- President Bush, as part of an effort to
show broader American support for nascent democracies in
Eastern Europe, said the U.S. Export-Import Bank is opening a
new line of credit for Poland.
   Mr. Bush said the bank, an independent government agency
that finances exports of American goods, will begin offering
medium-term loans and loan guarantees and medium-term credit
insurance for projects in Poland. Previously, the Ex-Im Bank
was providing only short-term credit insurance, the White
House said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Short-term financing generally is extended for only one
year, while medium-term financing can be repaid over roughly
five to seven years, White House officials said. They added
that any new financing for projects in Poland would have to
come out of existing Ex-Im Bank funds, meaning that the
administration won't seek additional funds for the
president's initiative.
   Mr. Bush announced the step at a commencement address here
at the University of South Carolina. He said the move was
part of an American effort to "export our experience" to help
Eastern Europe nations that are shucking their Communist
systems.
   All told, the modest package of initiatives announced by
the president amount to a relatively low-cost attempt to
counter assertions that he hasn't been aggressive enough in
helping Eastern Europe pull away from Soviet control.
   In addition to the new Ex-Im Bank financing, Mr. Bush said
that the U.S. will be sending delegations to observe coming
elections in Romania and Bulgaria and will participate in a
meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe in a few weeks to draw up guidelines on free elections
and political pluralism.
   Mr. Bush also announced the formation of a Citizens
Democracy Corps, which will consist of private-sector
volunteers who will help East Europeans develop democracies
and market-oriented economies. Officials said the
administration will seek $300,000 in government funding to
get the Democracy Corps started.
   The White House didn't say how much new Ex-Im Bank
financing will be available for Poland. The bank's exposure
in Poland now is $52 million, mostly in financing arranged
before 1982.
   Offering new financing is a way for the U.S. to reward and
support Poland's painful decision to put its sagging
socialist economy through "shock therapy" of rapid change
toward a free-market system. U.S. officials want to encourage
other East European nations -- as well as the Soviet Union --
to launch similar programs of radical economic change.
   The new Ex-Im financing will be earmarked primarily for
projects involving Poland's small but growing private sector
or involving state enterprises that have put forth plans to
go private. Mr. Bush said the financing "will provide Poland
a new line of medium-term export credits and loan guarantees
for purchasing machinery, technology and services from
American suppliers."

   Alabama's Waste Law Roils Industry,
   Promising Supreme Court Showdown

   Civil War it isn't. But Alabama's unfurling of the states
rights banner in a hazardous-waste dispute is disrupting
interstate commerce, promising a Supreme Court showdown and
costing companies money.
   The True Temper Sports subsidiary of Black &amp; Decker Corp.,
for example, makes steel golf-club shafts at a plant in
Amory, Miss. Because the shafts must be dipped in a rinse to
remove excess chromium and nickel, last year the facility
generated roughly 80 tons of hazardous-waste rinsewater,
which True Temper, one of the U.S.'s largest golf-club
makers, disposed of at a specially equipped landfill in
nearby Emelle, Ala.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last fall, however, Alabama "blacklisted" Mississippi and
some 20 other states under a new law prohibiting out-of-state
hazardous waste from being disposed of in Alabama unless the
state where the waste was generated has similar facilities of
its own.
   As a result, True Temper must now ship its hazardous waste
to another disposal facility near Lake Charles, La. The trek
is 400 to 500 miles longer, which, at the standard
$3.50-a-mile transportation cost per shipment, has added
significantly to the Amory plant's hazardous-waste disposal
costs, says Michael Justice, a Black &amp; Decker environmental
and safety manager based in Memphis.
   So it goes as Alabama's new law starts to hurt
hazardous-waste generators around the U.S. "This thing is
catching on like wildfire," frets James S. Lawson Jr.,
executive director of the Lauderdale County (Miss.) Economic
Development Authority.
   "We're very concerned about the potential for disruption"
of hazardous-waste disposal, says Dennis Redington, director
of regulatory management for Monsanto Co.
   In South Carolina, a year-old executive order has
effectively blacklisted five states. In Louisiana and Ohio,
legislators currently are considering laws similar to
Alabama's.
   Moreover, if the Alabama statute survives pending court
challenges -- and it's already been upheld by a federal
district judge in Alabama -- "It's highly likely that other
states with hazardous-waste disposal facilities will try to
do the same thing. We risk having a snowball effect that
would be a disaster," says Allen Moore, president of the
National Solid Wastes Management Association, a trade group
that has sued to overturn the Alabama law.
   As if a blacklisting wasn't enough, Alabama last month
passed a companion measure that raises by five-fold the tax
on out-of-state shipments of hazardous waste to Alabama. That
action has brought lawsuits from companies as far away as
Massachusetts.
   Nationwide, about 10 million tons of hazardous waste a
year is transported off site for disposal. About three
million tons move interstate, according to Chemical Waste
Management Inc., the 78%-owned hazardous-waste disposal
subsidiary of Waste Management Inc., Oak Brook, Ill., which
owns the Emelle facility.
   While three million tons is less than 3% of the 240
million to 280 million tons of hazardous waste generated per
year in the U.S., it's enough so that, "Alabama's actions
threaten serious disruption to the national economy as it
relates to hazardous waste," according to brief filed by the
U.S. Justice Department in the federal appeals court in
Atlanta. While most hazardous waste gets disposed of on site,
it's the really nasty stuff that often gets transported,
because only a limited number of facilities are equipped to
handle it. Only five incinerators in the U.S. are permitted
to dispose of polychlorinated biphenols, or PCBs, for
example.
   The appeals court in Atlanta has been asked by the Justice
Department and the waste-disposal industry to overturn the
Alabama law on the grounds that it violates the Commerce
Clause of the Constitution. The court is expected to hand
down its decision within a couple of weeks. However it rules,
both sides expect this states rights' case to be decided by
the Supreme Court.
   Alabama officials say the blacklist law is intended to
avoid having the state become a hazardous-waste "dumping
ground." They wanted, they say, to force other states to
confront local public opposition to the siting of new
hazardous-waste disposal facilities. "One seventh of all
hazardous waste that goes to commercial landfills gets buried
at Emelle. Other states should learn to take care of their
own," says Stacey Rimer, assistant press secretary for
Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Even the Justice Department, in its brief filed with the
appeals court, agrees with Alabama that other states need to
build disposal facilities. Moreover, the Alabama law appears
to be having the salutary effect of spurring recycling. True
Temper Sports, for example, decided to seek out a
metals-recycling firm in Corpus Christi, Texas, and, in about
two weeks, will start shipping its leftover chromium and
nickel to this firm, which will reclaim the materials and
sell them to smelters.
   Still, "It's a crime what Alabama's doing," contends
Oakley Keller, environmental safety director for Fame
Plastics Inc., a Daytona Beach, Fla., subsidiary of Essef
Corp. Mr. Keller's argument is that, because of its limerock
formation, the Emelle facility is "unique geologically" and
perhaps, he says, "the safest place in the U.S. to dispose of
hazardous waste."
   Mr. Keller, whose company now ships to Oklahoma the
chromic acid, nitric acid and other nasty wastes it generates
in making business-machine housings, says that to try to
force Florida to come up with a similar facility is "nuts.
Why, at four feet down in Florida, you hit an aquifer," he
says.
   Ms. Rimer, the Alabama governor's spokeswoman, responds:
"You don't have to bury hazardous waste. It can be
incinerated."

   Laventhol &amp; Horwath Faces More Woes
   As It Loses Unit and Key Executives
   ----

   NEW YORK -- Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the seventh-biggest U.S.
accounting firm, is encountering new setbacks in the wake of
its litigation problems and profit decline.
   The Philadelphia-based firm has lost a big Canadian
affiliate, is experiencing an exodus of key personnel and is
under pressure from its main lender to sell some of its
divisions or units, people close to the situation said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Laventhol declined comment on the personnel losses and the
alleged bank problems. But it confirmed that its Canadian
affiliate with 30 partners and 200 professional staffers in
Toronto and annual revenue of $25 million Canadian dollars
(US$21.3 million) is planning to join Price Waterhouse in
Canada by July 1 or later.
   In Toronto, Eric Slavens, co-managing partner of the
Toronto office, said: "We're joining Price Waterhouse because
we need more cross-country coverage for clients in Canada and
Price Waterhouse gives us full 21-city coverage."
   Edward Suarez, a national partner with Laventhol, which
has 51 U.S. offices and annual U.S. revenue of $345.2
million, said that the Toronto office is a separate firm of
Horwath International, Laventhol's international
organization. "We still have three other affiliates in Canada
in Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal," he added.
   But other current and former Laventhol officials said that
the Toronto affiliate and Horwath's London affiliate are key
cogs in making Laventhol an international firm. "This loss
will really hurt them," said one former Laventhol executive.
Mr. Suarez said he believes that Horwath would seek another
affiliate in Toronto.
   The Canadian setback comes at a time when Laventhol is
still reeling from large U.S. lawsuits. These have resulted
in the firm's paying out more than $50 million over the past
three years for alleged sloppy audit and
financial-preparation work. Also, Laventhol's operating
profit prior to litigation costs in the year ended last Jan.
31 declined 9% from a year earlier and Laventhol reduced a
quarterly profit distribution to partners in mid-April by
half.
   Laventhol declined comment about its current problems,
issuing a statement declaring that questions are a "rehashing
of past situations and innuendo and unattributed false
claims." Reached at home, Robert N. Levine, who will assume
the firm's top post on June 1 and is effectively running
Laventhol's operations now, declined comment beyond the
statement.
   Meanwhile, however, a person close to Laventhol said that
Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Chase Bank, a lead lender of an $80
million loan package, has two employees at Laventhol's
Philadelphia office monitoring Laventhol's receivables. The
$80 million package is allegedly double what Laventhol had
borrowed from banks prior to this year. The bank has
suggested that Laventhol sell off two divisions --
Construction Monitoring and Valuation Counselors -- to put
the accounting firm on a sounder financial footing, the
person said. Laventhol declined to confirm or deny the
report, and Chase officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   Construction Monitoring, which values construction
projects for financial institutions and monitors conformance
with construction-loan agreements, is based in New York and
has offices in San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles. Its
annual revenue ranges between $3 million and $4 million.
   Valuation Counselors, which values businesses, assets,
property and equipment and does real-estate and health-care
facility appraisals, is based in Chicago and has offices in
Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Boston and Princeton, N.J. Its
annual revenue tops $19 million.
   In addition, a growing number of partners and others are
leaving Laventhol, though some say the reasons are unrelated
to the firm's problems.
   In Chicago, key strategic-planning and health-care
consultants have told Laventhol of plans to go elsewhere.
These include Barbara Shomaker and Edward Kazemek,
consultants who are starting their own firm; Kristine E.
Peterson, a healthcare consultant who said she plans to
travel to Sweden for a year, and Bruce Richman, who said he
plans to join the Chicago office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a
major accounting firm.
   Asked why he was leaving, Mr. Richman, who joined
Laventhol in 1987, said, "It's no secret about what's going
on at Laventhol." He added: "One of the problems is that {we}
are not always totally informed about the firm's problems."
   Others who have left or who have announced plans to leave
Laventhol include Philip Winik, area managing partner for the
firm's western region out of Los Angeles; Al Zezulinski, a
health-care consultant based in Philadelphia; David Love,
managing partner of the Boston office; Peter Griffith, a
consultant in Boston; David Ross, a management consultant
based in New York; Bruce Ross, no relation to David, in
litigation support in Los Angeles; and Ernest Ten Eyck,
national accounting and auditing partner in Philadelphia.
   Mr. Winik, 55 years old, said he plans to take early
retirement for "personal reasons." He added: "My decision
wasn't spur-of-the-moment and has nothing to do with the
current state of the firm. I've planned it for some time."
   David Ross said he planned to leave June 1 after being
with Laventhol for 10 years. "I feel I'd rather be in
industry than with a public accounting firm," he said,
declining further comment.
   Asked why he was leaving, Bruce Ross declined comment.
   Mr. Ten Eyck said he plans to leave Laventhol next year
after 10 years with the firm. He said that his leaving
doesn't relate to any problems Laventhol is having "but that
at the age of 46 I have decided to do something else other
than public accounting."

   MONTREAL -- Bombardier Inc. has "identified most if not
all" of the members of a consortium that would build a
proposed high-speed rail link between Quebec City and Toronto
using French TGV (very fast train) technology, said Pierre
MacDonald, the vice president in charge of the project.
   "The consortium would be a broad group" that would include
Canadian, U.S. and international "industrial and financial
leaders," Mr. MacDonald said. He declined to identify the
members of the group but said Bombardier has "concluded
agreements with some members and is negotiating with the
others." Bombardier is a Montreal-based transportation
equipment and aerospace concern. It holds the North American
rights to the French TGV technology.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview after a presentation here to a government
task force studying high-speed rail, Mr. MacDonald wouldn't
say if the CP Rail unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd. and
government-owned Canadian National, Canada's two major
railroads, have agreed to join the Bombardier consortium, but
added "we've said all along that the project can't fly
without CP and CN."
   A Canadian Pacific spokesman said "we've had discussions
with many groups {regarding high-speed rail} but we haven't
made any commitments yet." A person familiar with the
Bombardier project said Canadian Pacific staff visited France
to study the TGV train and are enthusiastic about the
potential of a Canadian TGV line.
   As reported, Bombardier proposes building a TGV line
connecting Quebec City, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. The
line would cost about 5.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$4.5
billion), of which the Canadian, Quebec and Ontario
governments would be asked to contribute about C$1.6 billion.
