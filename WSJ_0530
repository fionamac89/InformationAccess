   Tektronix Plans
   To Lay Off 1,300,
   Close Some Lines

   BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Tektronix Inc., the embattled
electronics testing and measurement concern, said it will lay
off at least 1,300 employees by August, sell or shut down
several of its business lines, and take a $70 million charge
in its fiscal fourth quarter as a result of this major
restructuring.
   Tektronix also said that negotiations have fallen through
in its efforts to sell its Grass Valley Group subsidiary to
Sony Corp. The company couldn't get Sony to agree to an
acceptable price.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is one of those companies that really got swallowed
and chewed up by the '80s," says Stephen Balog of Shearson
Lehman Hutton, who follows Tektronix closely.
   The company failed years earlier to jump into areas like
computer-aided software and workstations when it had the
chance, Mr. Balog says, adding, "The whole Apollo-Sun
Microsystems thing could have been them."
   Instead, the company's earnings have been declining since
1985, and in its last year the company sustained its first
annual loss since the company was founded in 1946. In its
latest fiscal third quarter, Tektronix reported a $25 million
net loss. Its stock fell to a 14-year low this winter, where
it currently remains. And in April, its president David
Friedley resigned under pressure, when the board decided he
wasn't reorganizing the company fast enough.
   Tektronix won't reveal which business lines it
specifically intends to sell for several weeks, but a company
spokesman said all will be in "non-core" fields in the
company's test and measurement and non-television related
communication groups. Depending on which divisions the
company sells, the number of layoffs may be higher, the
spokesman said.
   The layoffs, which represent 10 percent of Tektronix's
work force, comes on the heels of labor cuts of 1,400 other
jobs in the last fiscal year. The company shut down its plant
in Guernsey, one of the U.K.'s Channel Islands in January,
dismissing 220 employees. Then its facilities in Clark
County, Wash., were closed; about 50 employees lost their
jobs and the rest were transferred.
   The layoffs will be especially painful for the Portland,
Ore., area, where 1,000 of the latest dismissals are expected
to take place. Tektronix is the largest manufacturing
employer in the state and the second largest private
employer.
   Laid-off employees, who will be notified by the end of
June, will range from managers to production line workers to
support staff, a company spokesman said. They will receive
one week's pay for every year of service.
   The last few years has brought the greatest travails for
Tektronix as its new products generated killer costs,
production snafus and a cool reception from customers. The
company belatedly entered the workstation business, for
example, only to be 18 months late in bringing its product to
market.
   The effort to finance new products has taxed the company's
resources. "To cap it all off, the enormous levels of funding
have probably hurt their ability to manage their
bread-and-butter business," says Richard Chu, an analyst who
follows the company for Cowen &amp; Co. And the nearly $200
million a year the company is spending on research and
development has so far yielded little in the way of lucrative
business opportunities.
   Ironically, in the 1970s, Tektronix designed what was one
of the first engineering workstations ever, but the company
never got it off the production line. "The product was
reasonably successful and they went on to do a more powerful
version, along the lines of Apollo," recalls Thomas Bruggere,
chief executive officer of Mentor Graphics, who was a
software engineer manager at Tektronix at the time, in the
division designing the workstation. "They had, at least,
enough vision to realize this was a product worth doing. But
they didn't have enough execution to get it out the door."
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Tektronix rose to $15.375, up $1.

   Thornburgh Asks
   For Expansion
   Of HUD Inquiry

   WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asked the
special prosecutor investigating former Housing Secretary
Samuel Pierce to examine new allegations of political
favoritism at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   The request by Mr. Thornburgh, whose initial
recommendation for an investigation was narrowly drawn, came
in response to testimony before a House subcommittee by
DuBois Gilliam, a former Pierce deputy. Mr. Gilliam, who is
serving an 18-month prison sentence for accepting illegal
gratuities, told the subcommittee that Mr. Pierce had
instructed him several times to award grants to projects tied
to powerful Republicans. Mr. Gilliam also testified about
alleged kickbacks paid to HUD officials by developers seeking
favorable treatment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Thornburgh's latest request came in a letter to the
court-appointed special prosecutor, Arlin Adams, asking him
to expand his inquiry to include the new allegations of
favoritism in grants from Mr. Pierce's discretionary fund and
from another HUD urban development program.
   A number of lawmakers from both parties had urged a
broader investigation following Mr. Gilliam's testimony. But
Mr. Pierce's lawyers have challenged Mr. Gilliam's
credibility, given his criminal conviction.
   "Mr. Pierce has done nothing wrong," Paul Perito, a Pierce
attorney, said yesterday. "We have nothing to fear by an
impartial review of scurrilous allegations of Gilliam by a
group of dedicated and responsible prosecutors as opposed to
the hysteria and insatiable thirst for publicity of a
congressional inquiry gone awry."
   Mr. Adams is expected to follow the attorney general's
suggestion. In a brief prepared statement yesterday he said
that "in light of the Gilliam testimony, it may be
appropriate to redefine the mandate of the independent
counsel," which is the formal name for Mr. Adams's office. "I
shall, of course, carefully consider this letter from the
attorney general during the next few days and take action
promptly," Mr. Adams added.

   Massachusetts Considers Broad Sales Tax
   On Services in a Bid to Close Budget Gap

   BOSTON -- Massachusetts is considering adopting a 5% sales
tax on services -- including fees charged by mutual fund
managers and other financial services -- that would be among
the broadest in the nation.
   A bill approved by the state Senate also would impose the
tax on fees charged by accountants, lawyers and
public-relations firms, among others, as part of a tax
package designed to eliminate an estimated $800 million
budget deficit for the year ending June 30.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The state House, however, has proposed its own ideas to
reduce the budget deficit, passing a bill that would increase
the state income tax. The two bodies could meet in a joint
committee later this week to begin to chisel a final version.
   The Senate bill is also likely to face fierce lobbying
efforts from groups representing service companies. Indeed, a
similar proposal in Florida three years ago set off a
national outcry among lobbyists and was soundly defeated. And
two weeks ago, New York dropped an effort to tax advertising,
accounting and other services as part of a tax-raising
package.
   Among the most vocal critics of the proposed Massachusetts
tax is the state's mutual fund industry, which includes
Fidelity Investments, the U.S.'s largest mutual fund company.
"It's clearly unfair," argued Jonathan Dubitzky, a Boston
attorney who represents a number of financial services
groups. "The added expense would make a firm like Fidelity
less competitive than Dreyfus or any out-of-state money
manager. Almost no state in this country is crazy enough to
tax its own exports."
   This tax could lead to a mass exodus of such financial
services, adds Richard A. Manley, president of the
Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation Inc. "Massachusetts is the
birthplace of the mutual fund industry. I think you'll lose
them all," he says. "It's one thing for a manufacturing
company to move. For a lot of these folks it's a matter of
putting a computer on a truck and getting out."
   In sculpting its bill to tax services, the Massachusetts
Senate excluded fees charged by advertising agencies, in part
because of heavy lobbying. An advertising tax would have
brought in about $25 million in a overall package aimed at
generating $930 million in added revenue, says Joseph Brady,
fiscal adviser for Senate President William Bulger's office.
"We were told Florida had a lot of trouble with advertising
so the decision was to leave it out," he says. In 1987,
Florida repealed its law after only a few months, after
advertisers threatened to take their business to other
states.
   Lobbying by service-industry groups in Massachusetts has
been intense over the past week, legislators say. But adds
Joan Fallon, spokeswoman for Sen. Patricia McGovern,
"Lobbyists don't change a public opinion poll {taken last
week}, which shows people favor the proposal by a 3-to-1
vote."
   Passage of the bill could embolden other states on the
hunt for new tax avenues. "The Florida experience made states
nervous," says Christopher Zimmerman, chief economist for the
National Conference of State Legislatures. "But there's not
an economic justification to exclude this area; goods and
services are the same thing. Massachusetts could open the
door wider."
   By the year 2000 services are expected to constitute 70%
of the nation's economy, up from 30% in 1950. "If we don't
change our tax structure we'll be losing ground," says Ronald
Schreiner, secretary of the Department of Revenue for South
Dakota, which already taxes many of the services on
Massachusetts' list. "We believe this is the wave of the
future," he says.
   Hawaii and New Mexico, in addition to South Dakota, also
tax a broad variety of services. But many of those laws have
been in the books for more than a decade or two, and major
industrial states so far have avoided such taxes.
   Last year Connecticut passed a watered-down version of a
bill, limiting taxation to such things as architectural and
engineering services, telecommunications, locksmithing and
property renovations, among others.
   Lawmakers there orginally considered including accounting,
legal services and advertising in the bill, notes Rep.
William Cibes, chairman of Connecticut's House finance
committee. "Lobbying was intense," he says. "For example, the
advertising group made it very clear to {legislative} members
that they would go after them come election time.
Consequently, we didn't get the votes."
   Connecticut enacted its tax law with some regret, concedes
Rep. Cibes. "I think this has made our engineers and
architects less competitive. Many of our historical
restoration projects aren't renovating as a result."

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Marketers Study Ways to Deliver
   Junk Mail on Disposable Videos

   Junk mail may never be the same again. The people behind
all those bothersome fliers, catalogs and
you-may-have-already-won] sweepstakes are exploring a new way
to grab people at home: disposable videocassettes.
   Philmax, an Owings Mills, Md., firm, plans to start
producing inexpensive, cardboard videocassettes next month.
The cassettes aren't durable, wearing out after about 10
viewings, but Philmax says that makes them ideal for junk
mail pitches. Already, a credit card company and a health
care firm are planning to use the cardboard cassettes to send
informational videos to customers and potential customers,
Philmax says. Several other manufacturers are also working on
cheap videocassettes whose parts wear out after a few
viewings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The idea behind the inexpensive disposables "is basically
to replace direct mail. We think it's going to bring direct
mail into the video age," says Philip Brecher, a Philmax
co-owner. He envisions video catalogues and magazines, and
video versions of product instructions.
   If the disposable videocassettes catch on -- still a big
if -- they could immensely broaden the use of videocassette
premiums among advertisers. So far, most videocassette
promotions have revolved around videos people watch more than
once. National Football League videos of teams and bloopers
have been used as tie-ins with Sports Illustrated
subscriptions, Castrol motor oil, and Citibank Visa and
MasterCards. Burger King recently sold about seven million
copies of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle episodes in a promotion
tied to its kids' meals.
   The disposable videos, though, could broaden that range,
offering everything from political fund-raising pleas to
Cuisinart directions. "It isn't going to work for a Burger
King delivering seven million Ninja Turtle tapes, because
those are going to be watched over and over again," says Ira
Mayer, publisher and editor of Entertainment Marketing
Letter, a newsletter. But he says the tapes would be a
natural, for instance, for alcohol or cigarette companies:
"They're having a hard time as it is finding advertising
outlets. They might do something like this as a monthly
magazine."
   The disposables could compete with direct mail because
their cost would be relatively low. A mass mailing of a
typical plastic video costs about $3 apiece, including
postage. Philmax's cardboard videos could cost as little as
$1.15 apiece, including postage, Philmax says.
   Advertisers are studying the new technology with interest,
but most have yet to take the plunge. A Burger King
spokeswoman, for example, says the fast food chain is
"certainly aware of the disposables," but that it is
"premature for us to comment on the viability for Burger
King."
   And plenty of industry executives remain skeptical about a
cardboard videocassette, especially one that's been through
the mail. Philmax says its cassettes work 95% of the time,
even after being trampled on. In a test mailing of 200
cassettes, the failure rate was only about 2%, says Mr.
Brecher. But Entertainment Marketing's Mr. Mayer points out
that if the video looks handled when it arrives in the mail,
"I'm not sure that anybody -- myself included -- would want
to put that into their VCR." He also is skeptical about what
will happen if the mailed tape gets wet, and whether the tape
might get stuck in a VCR.
   A more practical problem for the manufacturers of
disposables, though, may be that the price of the real McCoy
has come down in many cases. Persona, a People-style video
magazine now being tested in Colorado and Indiana, costs
$4.95 -- and comes on a standard plastic videocassette which
can be re-used to record other programs. The price is held
down by advertising on the video magazine.
   "I don't want to reduce the secondary value we give to the
consumer, which is the ability to re-record over our
cassettes," says Charles-Terry Goldstein, chief executive
officer of Majestic Video Publishing, which publishes
Persona. He said he finds the idea of a cardboard video
"intriguing," but he has turned down manufacturers of cheap
tapes with parts made to wear out quickly. "The last thing
I'd want," he says, "is for someone to buy the thing, then
have it break down and feel they've gotten ripped off."

   Your April 18 editorial "Lawmakers for Life" was on the
mark. If the principle underlying the American system of
government could be summed up in a single sentence, it would
be Lord Acton's: "Power corrupts." The S&amp;L scandal alone is
reason enough to limit the power of our Imperial Congress.
   I serve on the board of Americans to Limit Congressional
Terms, and heartily endorse its efforts. But many state
legislators who agree in principle with term limits are
reluctant to embrace the ALCT's initiative because of the
dangers, real and imagined, of a "runaway" Constitutional
Convention.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Colorado, we're trying a different approach. Coloradans
to Limit Terms is attempting to put on the November ballot an
amendment to our state constitution to limit Colorado's U.S.
senators and representatives to 12 consecutive years in the
same office, and to limit the governor, state executive
officers and state legislators to eight consecutive years in
the same office.
   Term limits have been endorsed by two of the three
candidates for the U.S. Senate in Colorado this year --
Republican Rep. Hank Brown and Democrats Carlos Lucero and
Josie Heath -- and by all three candidates for the House seat
Rep. Brown is vacating.
   We're trying to bring about federal term limits in much
the same way earlier Progressives obtained direct election of
U.S. senators. The Congress then was as reluctant as the
Congress now to reform. But Colorado and other progressive
states passed laws requiring the legislature to select the
Senate candidate who had won a popular election. Eventually,
Congress bowed to the inevitable and ratified de jure what
was already de facto the practice in much of the country.
   If other states were to follow the Colorado approach, we
could bring about federal term limits without the need to
call a Constitutional Convention.

   Tokyo stock prices fell back under pressure from
profit-taking and some arbitrage selling, posting their first
loss in six trading days.
   Meanwhile, in London, prices finished mostly higher,
although traders didn't attach too much importance to the
rise, given the thin trading conditions.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 373.94 points to
32817.67 Tuesday, after advancing 397.73 points Monday.
   In early trading Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose
52.52 points to 32870.19.
   Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 800
million shares, up from 765 million shares Monday.
   Decliners outnumbered advancers 650 to 327, while 154
issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 22.39 points, or 0.92%, to 2411.66, after
gaining 14.11 points Monday.
   The second section index, after shedding 8.47 points
Monday, rose 1.99 points, or 0.05%, to 3886.37. Volume was
estimated at 17 million shares, up from 14 million shares
Monday.
   After opening just below Monday's closing level, the
Nikkei Index remained on the minus side all day yesterday
before closing near its intraday low.
   Declines in index futures preceded those in cash prices.
Sentiment was also hurt by lower bond prices, which fell back
after posting gains for five consecutive trading days, and
the rise of the dollar in the afternoon over the 150-yen
level, traders said.
   But profit-taking was prompted mainly by investors'
caution about the fast-paced advances of both the yen and
stock prices in the past week, said Shigeru Akiba, head of
equity trading at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International.
   Traders expected active buying yesterday, the first
trading day for transactions recorded on June accounts. Those
expectations met with active profit-taking, especially by
institutions, the Phillips &amp; Drew trader said.
   Some traders said they welcomed the decline after the
Nikkei Index had gained a total of 1426 points, or 4.5%, in
the previous five trading days. "To be honest, the fall was
good for the market," said a senior trader at Wako
Securities.
   The selling will result in lower selling pressure in the
future, providing more space for the market to advance, the
trader said.
   Steel makers, shipbuilding companies, electric utilities
and construction issues fell yesterday, after advancing
strongly the past week.
   Sumitomo Metal dropped 26 yen to 629 yen (17 cents to
$4.20), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries fell 20 yen to 1030 yen.
Tokyo Electric Power slipped 180 yen to 4810 yen.
   Among construction issues, Ohbayashi fell 30 yen to 1710
yen, while Taisei shed 30 yen to 1380 yen. Shimizu, however,
added 50 yen to 2090 yen as the company's bright earnings
outlook for the current fiscal year attracted investors,
traders said.
   Bank shares were sold following their earning reports
Monday that showed the 13 Tokyo banks posting an average
19.9% decline in annual pretax profits for the latest fiscal
year.
   Mitsubishi Bank dropped 40 yen to 2530 yen. Fuji Bank
plummeted 60 yen to 2790 yen.
   On the other hand, investors hunted for high-technology
shares with strong earnings prospects, traders said. Sony
gained 60 yen to 8660 yen, while Kyocera was up 160 yen to
7870 yen. Sharp added 40 yen to 1840 yen.
   In other stock market-related news, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange said that in the week ended Friday, the balance of
margin buying increased 6.8 billion yen to 7.717 trillion
yen. The balance of short positions outstanding, meanwhile,
declined 49 billion yen to 571.5 billion yen.
   In London, most of the buying in morning trading was
confined to stock futures, while the market's late afternoon
surge was fueled by Wall Street's rise.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
30 points to 2295.6 points, the intraday high. The index fell
to a low of 2258.7 just after the start of official trading.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 23.3 points to
1823.3. Volume was 330 million shares, compared with 385.6
million issues Friday, the previous trading day.
   Traders ascribed the low trading volumes in part to
Monday's public holiday in the U.K., with many participants
apparently extending holiday weekends.
   Traders were divided on whether the market can sustain the
robust gains. Some traders pointed to the continued negative
factor of high British interest rates and the onset of
summer, while others noted that trading sentiment is
"reasonably firm."
   The latter expected that if the Dow Jones Industrial
Average held steady to the close yesterday, London's FT-SE
100 index could easily breach the psychologically important
2300 mark later in the week.
   The few stocks that posted losses yesterday went
ex-dividend. These alone would normally account for a
collective four-point fall on the 100 share index, traders
said.
   Gains were broad-based, with no one sector benefiting the
most. Those stocks showing the largest gains included ICI,
which rose 19 pence (32 cents) on speculation that it will
soon dispose of its 25% stake in Enterprise Oil, and British
Aerospace, which benefited from an absence of sellers.
British Aerospace rose 16 pence.
   The rise in some other stocks, such as Reuters, which
gained 23 pence, appeared large, but on a percentage basis
was in line with the remainder of the market.
   Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Milan; and lower in
Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed higher.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, stocks closed lower in Hong
Kong and Manila; higher in Sydney, Taipei, Wellington and
Seoul. Singapore shares ended mixed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   On Sports: Diving at the Puck

   Downers Grove, Ill. -- A perusal of the sports calendar
for Memorial Day weekend revealed lots of baseball, the
middle games of the penultimate NBA playoff round, a bunch of
routine-looking golf "classics" and the Indianapolis 500, an
event in which cars and drivers vie to see which can carry
the most advertising stickers.
   I rejected that last thing out of hand (I went once and
found it gastly), and reasoned that I could catch up with the
others at other, more critical times. I chose instead to
attend the National Underwater Hockey Championships at the
Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine in this western
suburb of the Windy City.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I did so for several reasons. One is that I'm a sucker for
anything with "national" in its title. Another is that I'd
never seen anyone skate underwater. Finally, I hadn't seen
Brent Musberger in awhile, and was hoping he'd be covering it
for ABC.
   I was disappointed in two of those quests. They didn't
skate here, they swam -- in a pool -- and Brent and ABC were
elsewhere. The event, however, was quite national, with 12
teams representing 10 cities. The winner was Club Puck, from
San Francisco, which defeated a Seattle team in the Sunday
afternoon final of the single-elimination tournament.
   En route to the crown, the team from the bottom of the Bay
also beat Club Psychopuck, from St. Louis, and the gang I was
rooting for, Club Fred, from Chicago, the 1987 champs. The
Freds recouped somewhat by winning the unofficial
congeniality award for providing a covered truck in the
parking lot equipped with two battered sofas, a boom box, a
large keg of beer and chairs for tanning.
   "Our guys got older, and a bit out of shape, but our pre-
and post-game parties have held up well," noted Club Fred
stalwart Heinz Werning, who sported a Mohawk-style hairpiece
taped to his bald pate.
   Inside, though, the sport was spirited and altogether
serious. Underwater hockey is played by six-person teams (the
tourney was co-ed) equipped with fins, masks and snorkels.
They use 14-inch, unbladed sticks to try to shoot or push a
leaded puck about the size of a can of tuna fish into a
three-meters-wide (10-foot) goal at the pool's bottom.
Besides general athleticism and the usual aquatic skills, it
requires strong lungs, the better to stay submerged long
enough to do some good.
   The idea, however, isn't to see who can stay down the
longest. "The best work is done in 5-to-12-second bursts,"
explained mustached Joe Grandov, a Club Puck member and coach
of the U.S. men's all-star team that will compete in the
sport's world championships next month in Montreal. "You dive
under, pass the puck to a teammate, and get back to the
surface to catch your breath and track play until you can be
useful again."
   He added: "Positioning and teamwork count most. We can't
be Wayne Gretskys and take the puck the length of the pool
alone to score. We have to come up for air; Wayne never
does."
   The tourney was conducted by the Underwater Society of
America, which oversees a number of sports. There's also fin
swimming, which includes above- and below-surface events;
free and scuba diving; underwater rugby (]); spearfishing;
and underwater photography. In that last activity, each
contestant gets a roll of film and four hours to paddle
around a defined area and shoot underwater scenes, with a
panel of judges determining the winner.
   The society is an affiliated member of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, and, as such, would like to see underwater events
in future O Games. Interestingly, underwater swimming does
have an Olympic past. The 1900 Games, in Paris, gave medals
for an event in which two points were awarded for every meter
a competitor covered underwater, and one point for every
second he stayed down. The winner, France's Charles de
Vendeville, got 188.4 points for traversing 60 meters in 68.4
seconds. By contrast, the third-place finisher, a Dane,
stayed under for 90 seconds, but managed to swim only 28.5
meters.
   The 1904 Olympics, in St. Louis, included a plunge for
distance that measured how far swimmers could get on a single
dive without surfacing or further movement. The U.S.'s
William Dickey won at 62 feet, 6 inches, but his triumph was
ascribed largely to the absence of a couple of Englishmen
who'd previously bettered 75 feet. Alas, that was to be that
for underwater events, and they joined things like the
100-meter freestyle for sailors (Athens, 1896) on the
Olympic-swimming reject pile.
   If any underwater sport makes the Games, it probably will
be fin swimming, which features both speed and athlete
visibility. Underwater hockey is notably short on the latter:
Neither the puck, nor much significant underwater activity,
can be glimpsed from poolside. Sans underwater video or
windows below water level, the sport resembles nothing so
much as feeding time in the shark tank.
   That's kind of what it's like where the action is, too,
players say. "There are rules against rough stuff, but
there's still plenty. We all have bruises," averred Mary Jo
Ferris of Club Fred. "It's like NBA basketball -- a
non-contact sport with contact."
   Club Puck, featuring several U.S. world-team members,
cruised through the tourney with relative ease, beating St.
Louis in the semis, 9-1, and Seattle in the final, 7-3. The
pool in which the contests took place measured the proper 25
meters long, but, unlike venues for international
competitions, varied in depth from six to 12 feet, with a
down slope at the deep end that strongly favored teams
attacking in that direction.
   That edge was balanced because teams changed ends for each
15-minute half, but it was a mark of Club Puck's dominance
that, defending the deep end, it held the Seattleans to a 2-2
tie in the first half of the championship go.
   "We did some nice work, or at least I think we did,"
smiled Grandov, an engineer at Stanford University's linear
accelerator lab. "In underwater hockey, you're never really
sure what's going on unless you're down there yourself."

   Why Would Anyone Live in Penn Station?

   Commuters on the Long Island Railroad will notice an
unusual thing when they arrive Friday in New York's busiest
train station, Pennsylvania Station: It will no longer be a
shelter for the homeless. New regulations adopted by the
railroad will forbid sleeping in those areas of the station
under the LIRR's jurisdiction. Similar rules are already in
effect in Amtrak's areas of the station.
   Like all social phenomena, homelessness has complex
causes. But the conversion of New York's great transit
terminals into mass dormitories for the homeless does not.
The homeless sleep in the bus and train stations because New
Yorkers let them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Three or four decades ago, anyone trying to sleep his
liquor off in a station would have been harshly prodded awake
by a cop and ordered to move along. Now the cop passes him by
-- because he has been told to. A pair of visits to Penn
Station, one in the late afternoon and evening of April 5,
the other in the early morning of April 18, shows some of the
consequences of this new policy.
   ---
   None of the more than 300 homeless sleeping in the station
on the nights I visited resemble even remotely the
sympathetic types featured on the local news -- mothers with
children, working men who couldn't make ends meet.
   Under the social rules that prevail now, though, they have
been tempted into decisions that led them to addiction,
hustling, crime and life on the streets.
   As early as 4:30 in the afternoon, the homeless begin to
congregate along the station's main underground concourse:
clusters of old men drinking cans of Meisterbrau from paper
bags, a few panhandlers and hustlers who scurry away when
they feel the eyes of the police on them. Only one group of a
dozen youngish people has had the nerve to camp out so early.
Its members spread out their sleeping bags and flattened
cardboard boxes in front of a closed-up Bowery Savings Bank
storefront, utterly indifferent to the thousands of commuters
hurtling past their feet.
   I start a conversation with one of them. Why does he sleep
here?
   "I used to go to the Open Door" -- a municipal drop-in
center -- "but it's no good since it stopped being privately
run."
   But why sleep outdoors at all? Why not get a job and a
place of his own? "I don't mind working," he says
defensively. "I used to work construction and just a few
months ago I applied for a job as a janitor at the World
Trade Center -- a good job, $12 an hour. But you can't get
anything without an address."
   Does he take drugs?
   "No way," he insists. "I drink, sure, anything and
everything, but no drugs."
   Did he ever take drugs?
   A pause. "Well, uh, I used to. That's how I got into this
mess." He adds hastily, "But not anymore]"
   ---
   According to the LIRR police, roughly one-third of the
homeless people they see have spent time in mental hospitals,
like James Ragin, a big quiet man in his middle 40s. He says
he'd spent years in a mental hospital for the criminally
insane for "burning down a house in Kansas." Why? He shrugged
in boredom. "I wanted to kill everybody in those days."
   Most of the rest of the homeless in the station are either
addicts or drunks -- some completely down and out, others
functioning pretty well. At rush hour, a group of dignified
old men in reasonably clean clothes drinks beer from cans
wrapped in paper bags. It isn't clear whether they are
homeless at all. When asked, one of them replies: "As a
matter of fact, sir, we all have our ups and downs, and right
now I'm on the downs. I'll probably stay here tonight."
   It's the drunks, much more than the addicts, who keep
Pennsylvania Station lively until the early hours of the
morning. Toward midnight, a festive clump of young men and
one pretty young girl are partying noisily near the LIRR
police office. The rowdiest of the group says he is a
construction worker, but he hadn't gone in to work that day:
"Too drunk]" he says happily. "Anyhow, this way I save my
money. Today was payday. If I went in I'd have picked up my
money and it would all be gone now. This way, I save it."
   Meanwhile, the street hustlers are doing business. Near
midnight, a fat, middle-aged lady in spandex pants, her
fingers covered with rings, suitcases gathered around her, is
hunched over, squinting at a watch shown her by a lithe young
man. Almost immediately, she notices she is being watched,
and she hurriedly throws the watch back at the young man. "I
don't know why you show me this. I don't have any money to
give you]" she shrieks.
   The young man looks up and winks. His name is Tony. Where
had he got the watch? He ducks the question. "I love
watches," he smirks, and shows me three strapped to his left
arm. "I always tell a man by his watch. But I don't make my
living selling watches -- I make it from passes." He pulls a
thick sheaf of soiled cardboard from his pocket. "See, it
usually costs $20 to get into a club. But clubs give out
these passes so people can get in for just, like, $5. So I
sell it to you for $5. You save $10; I make $5 -- we're both
ahead. I've got passes for Mars, for MK, for the Palladium,
for any club you want."
   ---
   LIRR police arrest records offer something of a
statistical portrait of life in the station. In January, 52
arrests were made there. Most involved homeless people. Nine
of the arrests were for assault or attempted assault; four
were for robbery and six were for petty larceny.
   Only five of 52 arrestees were women. Twenty-eight were
black, 14 were Hispanic and 10 were white. None was Asian.
The average age of the arrestees was 30.2 years.
   Among the January arrestees, police found six people
hiding from warrants, including one for murder. Another was
wanted for violating his parole on a charge of first-degree
murder.
   In February -- the most recent month for which there are
complete figures -- the number of arrests jumped to 150. Six
were women. Ninety-six were black, 26 were Hispanic and 26
were white. By far the single largest category of arrest was
for disorderly conduct, but seven were arrested for assault
or attempted assault, three for petty larceny, two for
attempted grand larceny and one for burglary.
   These numbers suggest that Penn Station is actually quite
a safe place. In fact, Penn Station is not really a place
from which people enter the criminal justice system; it's one
of the places where they go when they are discharged.
   ---
   Gloomy ex-cons, many of them now drunks or addicts, hang
around the station, like Hamilton, a heavy-set bald man of 41
leaning face down against a tall garbage bin. His muscles
have slackened somewhat, but he is obviously a tough
character, with enormous hands and a barrel chest. He pulls
up his shirt to show, proudly, a long jagged scar down the
center of his belly. "I was upstate for eight years." He
smiles a mean smile. "I like to take things."
   By two in the morning the station is very quiet. The
sleepers lie in agglomerations in little neighborhoods,
segregated by race and age and invisible hierarchies. "I like
sleeping here," says one old man. "The Port Authority {bus
terminal} is like Sodom and Gomorrah. The commuters are
hard-working people, not like the trash in the bus station."
   A Hispanic "barrio" of about 50 people -- one couple
wrapped together in a blanket shares a hot pink Sony Walkman
-- forms near the border with Amtrak. Hispanic means Puerto
Rican: The LIRR police say they have never found an illegal
alien. "Who comes from Mexico to sleep in a train station?"
   Near the top of the hierarchy is a brisk young man wearing
brilliantly white running shoes. "We're not all bums, you
know. I work. I hold down two jobs -- one at Ticketron, one
as a security guard. I make good money." He pulls a thick wad
of bills out of his pocket. The one on top is a hundred. So
why is he here? "Aw man, if I had an address, my old lady
would find me and make me pay alimony. I'm just 22, I don't
have time for that s---."
   The quiet lasts until 4:30, when the cleaning staff comes
through. At five, the police send the sleepers on their way.

   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury has created a major stumbling
block for the Postal Service's plan to raise money in the
private credit market.
   The department has told the service that it can't switch
its borrowing to the private market from the Federal
Financing Bank unless the service gives up its special ties
to the government, including a $2 billion line of credit to
the Treasury.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Comer Coppie, senior assistant postmaster general for
finance, made it clear that the Postal Service isn't prepared
to relinquish its Treasury credit line. Another benefit, the
ability to request a federal guarantee for its debt, isn't
something the Postal Service contemplates using, he said.
   Mr. Coppie said the Treasury's position on Postal Service
borrowing was spelled out in a recent letter from Under
Secretary Robert Glauber. A copy of the letter wasn't
available, but a Treasury spokesman confirmed the
department's stance.
   Mr. Coppie said the Postal Service remains committed in
principle to changing its relationship with the Treasury, and
reiterated the agency's desire to borrow in the private
market rather than from the FFB, a financing entity within
the Treasury that raises money for many agencies.
   "We continue to have open communications" with the
Treasury, Mr. Coppie said. Still, he said, it seems clear at
this point that the Postal Service's next round of borrowing
will be done from the FFB.
   The Postal Service was taken out of the federal budget by
last year's budget reconciliation bill. It maintains that
borrowing in the private market would be consistent with the
off-budget treatment, that it would have more flexibility in
the private market, and that the discipline imposed by the
marketplace would be beneficial.
   The Postal Service is being supported in its quest by some
Wall Street firms interested in potential business
opportunities, officials said.

   High Court Action on Arbitration Pacts

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court let stand a federal
appeals court ruling that Massachusetts can't prohibit
securities firms from requiring customers to sign arbitration
agreements.
   The decision is a victory for the securities industry,
which challenged the Massachusetts regulations soon after
they were adopted by the Massachusetts secretary of state in
September 1988. The regulations were challenged by the
Securities Industry Association, a trade group, and by 10
major brokerage firms.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rules required securities brokers to disclose to
customers the effects of standard arbitration agreements, and
they barred brokers from insisting that customers sign such
agreements to open accounts, which is standard practice in
the industry.
   Last August, a federal appeals court in Boston ruled that
the Massachusetts rules conflict with the Federal Arbitration
Act and, therefore, are unconstitutional. The appeals court
said that federal law prohibits a state from singling out
securities arbitration agreements for tougher regulation than
other business contracts.
   "The long and short of it is that we can find no evidence
of a clear congressional command to override the unambiguous
pro-arbitration mandate of the Federal Arbitration Act in the
securities field," the appeals court said.
   The appeals court affirmed the December 1988 order of a
federal district judge in Boston who blocked the state from
enforcing the regulations. The state appealed to the high
court, which, without comment, refused to hear the case.
   Thirty other states joined in a friend-of-the-court brief
supporting Massachusetts' appeal. They argued that the effect
of the appeals court ruling "is to leave the states powerless
to protect consumers from being coerced to enter arbitration
agreements."
   But the Bush administration countered in a brief that the
appeals court decision "will not effectively undermine state
and federal regulatory efforts to police securities
arbitration provisions." (Connolly vs. Securities Industry
Association)
                                                                                                       

   Bank Liability
                                                                                                       

   The justices ruled, 8-1, that a federal appeals court in
New York should reconsider its decision that U.S. banks are
liable for deposits made in overseas branches that are
restricted by the actions of foreign governments.
   The high court's action left some issues unsettled, but
the decision was a victory for Citicorp's Citibank unit, and
for New York's other leading commercial banks.
   In July 1988, the appeals court found Citibank in New York
liable to a Wells Fargo &amp; Co. unit for $1,066,000, for
deposits made to a Citibank branch in Manila, Philippines.
The Manila branch was unable to repay the deposits, made in
U.S. dollars by Wells Fargo Asia Ltd., because of economic
regulations issued by the Philippine government in 1983 to
stop the flow of dollars out of the country.
   The appeals court ruled that it was proper to make
Citibank liable in New York because the funds were
transferred through New York accounts of both Wells Fargo
Asia and Citibank/Manila. The appeals court said there was an
agreement between the two banks to permit collection in New
York.
   The New York Clearing House, a trade group of 12 leading
commercial banks, warned in a friend-of-the-court brief that
the appeals court ruling "calls into question the legal
status of hundreds of billions of dollars of offshore
deposits." The brief noted that the transfer between Wells
Fargo and Citibank was handled through a standard
international, electronic payment system. The Bush
administration also said the appeals court was wrong.
   The Supreme Court, in a decision written by Associate
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, noted that the district court
didn't find an agreement that allowed Wells Fargo Asia to
collect the deposits in New York. The court said there was no
evidence that standard computer confirmation messages, used
in international banking, create agreements to make New York
banks liable for their overseas branches.
   The court ordered the appeals court to decide whether, in
the absence of an agreement, Citibank could still be held
liable under New York state, federal or Philippine law.
   John Warden, attorney for the New York Clearing House,
said the decision "is very helpful" because it makes clear
that the system of international electronic payments doesn't
create world-wide liability on the part of New York banks.
   Associate Justice John Paul Stevens III dissented.
(Citibank vs. Wells Fargo Asia)

   Chapter 11 Taxes
                                                                                                       

   The high court ruled, 8-1, that federal bankruptcy judges
may order the Internal Revenue Service to treat tax payments
made by a company in Chapter 11 reorganization as
contributions to employee income taxes and Social Security
withholding, rather than paying off the company's own
income-tax bill.
   The decision, written by Associate Justice Byron R. White,
is a defeat for the IRS. Unpaid contributions to employee tax
withholding accounts become the liability of a company's
officers. The IRS argued that allowing the company in Chapter
11 to pay withholding taxes ahead of its own income taxes
would allow corporate officers to shirk their
responsibilities at government expense. Associate Justice
Harry A. Blackmun dissented.
   The case involved two Rhode Island companies in Chapter 11
proceedings, Energy Resources Co. and Newport Offshore Ltd.
(U.S. vs. Energy Resources Co.)

   The justices agreed to decide whether an individual who
challenges a state tax as interfering with interstate
commerce may use a federal civil-rights law that allows those
who sue successfully to have the losers pay their legal
expenses and attorneys' fees. The justices will hear an
appeal by an Ohio trucker. He challenged a Nebraska
"retaliatory tax" imposed on truckers that do business in
Nebraska but are registered in other states that levy similar
taxes on vehicles registered in Nebraska. (Dennis vs.

   R. Cort Kirkwood, in his review of John Aird's book
"Slaughter of the Innocents" (Leisure &amp; Arts, May 14), tries
to link "the population control lobby" with the forced
abortions and sterilizations of China. It's hard to know if
this is sheer ignorance on his part, or the calculated
propaganda of someone trying to make points in the
anti-abortion war here at home.
   Let's go through it one more time: The issue is choice,
and who chooses. China says the state chooses, and enforces
that policy. The anti-choice types here in the U.S. also say
the state chooses: They want to make sure women can't choose
abortion. Some of them want to make sure women can't even
choose birth control. What those of us in the "population
control movement" want is for each woman to choose how and
when to have a family, of the size that she wants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the state may have an interest in the size of its
population, we believe the limits of state policy should be
to provide incentives to encourage one behavior or another.
For example, our tax code provides deductions and credits for
children, child care, etc.
   Just as the ACLU sometimes defends the rights of free
speech of hate groups in order to uphold the rights of all of
us to speak freely, we defend the right to abortion in order
to uphold women's right to choose. But no one in any
pro-choice or population-control group supports the actions
described in this review, of forced abortions and state
control of women's bodies. That's precisely what we are
fighting against.
   Mary Poulin
   Palo Alto, Calif.
   ---
   It's easy for someone sitting amid the bounty of U.S. food
production to criticize China for its family-planning
practices, and to imply that vague "economic development
objectives" were responsible for such programs. In fact, as
the Chinese leaders knew and Mr. Kirkwood should have known,
the limiting of births in the late 20th century was done to
prevent a greater tragedy -- deaths by starvation of
already-born children in the early 21st century.
   We are fortunate that our society has not been faced with
such a difficult set of options. But our harsh judgment of
one that has is unwarranted.
   Further unwarranted is the condemnation of coerced family
planning and abortion in China by Americans who favor coerced
childbearing by limiting access to contraceptives and
abortion in the U.S.
   In the ultimate irony, U.S. anti-abortionists used the
example of China to seek to limit funds for birth-control
programs in Third World countries that are trying to avoid
reaching the crisis point that forced China to turn to
unpalatable solutions.

   Workplace:
   More Employers Check Credit Histories
   Of Job Seekers to Judge Their Character

   There's growing cause to worry about your credit record:
It can cost you a job.
   In a practice affecting hundreds of thousands of job
seekers, a fast-rising number of companies are checking the
personal credit reports of prospective employees to judge
their integrity.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many jobs applicants may never even know it's happening.
That's because companies often don't tell them -- sometimes
in violation of the law, critics maintain. Some also question
the predictive value of the reports and charge that many
companies misuse them to obtain personal data they aren't
supposed to consider, such as age or marital status.
   Employers using credit reports, however, contend that
knowing how an applicant handles bills, loans and other
financial obligations helps predict whether he or she is
likely to steal, sell company secrets or otherwise act
irresponsibly on the job.
   Many banks and retailers that routinely consult credit
reports before granting credit lines or loans have long used
the reports to screen would-be tellers and cashiers. But,
citing rising internal theft and concern about their
liability for worker wrongdoing, a broader range of companies
are using the reports to screen for all types of positions.
   The boom in credit screening follows tight limits on
polygraph testing that took effect last year. In response,
the nation's three big credit-reporting agencies began
marketing their files to employers hungry for an alternative
evaluation tool.
   Equifax Inc. of Atlanta, which started selling its
employee-screening reports in July 1988 just after the
lie-detector ban was signed into law, claims it sold 350,000
of its reports to some 15,000 employers in 1989. It says
demand in the first quarter of this year ran 71% ahead of the
same period last year. Trans Union Credit Information Co. of
Chicago began selling employee-screening reports last
November and says it sold nearly 26,000 in March alone. TRW
Inc.'s credit data division in Orange, Calif., introduced its
reports in December but declines to release figures.
   Some employers praise the reports. After a rise in theft
that it traced to employees, Barry's Jewelers Inc., Monrovia,
Calif., started using credit reports last month to supplement
job interviews, applications and "pencil and paper" tests,
which seek to gauge integrity through multiple-choice
questions on ethical dilemmas. "It's one more added
precaution," says Carolyn J. Harrington, director of loss
prevention and internal audit.
   Of 62 candidates screened during the first three weeks of
the program, Barry's rejected 16, including three for
problems arising from credit reports. "We deal with loose
diamonds, we deal with highly resalable merchandise," Ms.
Harrington adds. "You have to take every opportunity
available to you to prevent hiring a thief."
   Nordstrom Inc., the department store chain based in
Seattle, runs credit checks on finalists for "sensitive" jobs
in its security, financial and credit departments. "When
somebody's having financial problems, there's more pressure
on them to do things they otherwise wouldn't do," says John
Walgamott, who as the chain's credit manager oversees 400
people who handle customer charge accounts. "One person could
hit you for thousands of dollars."
   Abbott Laboratories, a Chicago-based maker of medical
supplies, evaluates credit reports as "part of the routine
reference-checking on everybody," says Ellen Walvoord,
director of corporate communications. "If a person had
serious financial problems as revealed in their credit
report, it could affect their suitability for certain
positions," she adds, declining to be more specific.
   At less than $5 each, credit reports are cheap. They are
also simple to obtain, since the big credit agencies sell
online computer access to their data bases.
   Not every company is biting, but those that are often are
skittish about discussing the practice. J.C. Penney Co.
consults the reports on a "selective basis," says a
spokesman, but he wouldn't elaborate. "We really don't care
to talk about how we're using it," he says.
   Secrecy can affect job seekers, too. Under the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, the primary federal law on credit reports,
credit agencies must tell applicants they are being probed
only if their files contain public records on "adverse"
matters, such as arrests, suits, court judgments and tax
penalties. About 8% of reports contain such records, TRW
says.
   Employers, meanwhile, needn't inform job seekers about a
credit check when they apply (though many do so on
application forms). But when rejecting someone "either wholly
or partly because of information contained" in a credit
report, the law says a company is supposed to let that person
know and identify the agency supplying the report -- steps
often ignored, those familiar with industry practices
contend.
   "People are being denied employment because of what's in
their credit report, and are never told that's the reason,"
says Ken Yarbrough, a San Rafael, Calif., credit consultant
who once managed security for TRW's credit data business.
   "It would not surprise me that users of credit reports are
not aware of their obligations," says Jean Noonan, associate
director for credit practices at the Federal Trade
Commission, which regulates credit report practices. Without
disclosure, she adds, people might never learn to check for
troubles or errors in their records.
   Sunday K. Summer of Bossier, La., says she was rejected
for six different jobs as a hospital scrub nurse and drug
store clerk last year after employers checked her credit
report. The report states that her college loans were
delinquent -- she says they were deferred -- and also refers
to a bankruptcy-law filing made by her husband in 1981, when
he divorced his previous wife. The doctor that finally hired
her as an assistant said "that he had done some investigating
and knew that I needed the job based on my debts" --
specifically a $14,000 car loan that he couldn't have known
about, she says, unless he had checked her credit report.
   "It really felt awkward," Ms. Summer says. Having debts,
she adds, "doesn't mean I'm not going to be a good worker."
   Barry's Jewelers and Nordstrom say they strictly follow
the law when rejecting applicants for credit concerns; Abbott
declines to comment on its procedures. At Dallas-based EDS
Corp., when job offers are rescinded because of concerns
arising from credit reports, applicants initially are told
merely that "it's because of the background investigation,"
says Jon T. Senderling, public relations manager. Only "if a
person asks further," he says, does the company specify the
reason. Mr. Senderling insists that "everything we do is
completely within" the law.
   But Ms. Noonan of the FTC says companies must identify the
role of credit reports to spurned applicants forthrightly,
not just when asked.
   Interpretations of credit reports can vary widely. One
employer might balk at hiring someone with a string of late
Visa payments, while another might overlook more serious
problems, even loan defaults or bankruptcy.
   The lack of standards can lead to abuses. Besides
financial history and other background information, credit
reports may note a person's age, marital status and
dependents -- personal data most employers don't seek on
applications or in interviews because, under equal employment
laws, considering them is discriminatory.
   Yet Trans Union specifically sees its report as a way to
answer "some of the questions that you can't ask an
applicant," says Pat Malloy, a product support coordinator.
"This can fill in the holes."
   David F. Linowes, a University of Illinois professor and
expert on privacy issues, says he believes it "is not
uncommon" for employers to exploit credit reports for
personal information that could unfairly -- and illegally --
scuttle the chances of job applicants. People "do not have
adequate protection," he says.
   Moreover, some employee-testing experts contend credit
reports can't reliably predict trustworthiness. They note
that credit records can contain inaccuracies, honest people
can accrue bad credit records and people with clean credit
records aren't immune to temptation. "Managers naively assume
there's a link between a poor credit rating and theft
exposure," says John W. Jones of London House, a Chicago
personnel evaluating firm.
   Scrutinizing credit reports before hiring would flag no
more than 10% of "all the people who are acting irresponsibly
on the job," estimates Val J. Arnold, vice president of
Personnel Decisions Inc., a Minneapolis testing firm.
   Credit reporting agencies and companies can't cite studies
linking personal financial problems to dishonesty; they say
anecdotal experience and common sense prove the value of
credit reports.
   Still, William Byham, president of Development Dimensions
International Inc., a Pittsburgh-based personnel testing
firm, worries that companies are bound to unjustly reject
many promising applicants if credit reports continue to gain
appeal. "Everybody's looking for a quick fix," he says. But
"you have to spend a little time and money on selection if
you want to get good people."

   Merger of Walwyn,

   Wins Approval

   TORONTO -- Shareholders approved the merger of two
investment dealers, Walwyn Inc., and Midland Doherty
Financial Corp., which is 31%-owned by Union Enterprises Inc.
   The new concern created by the merger, which takes effect
Friday, will be named Midland Walwyn Inc. Union Enterprises
will retain an 11.5% interest, while Fairfax Financial
Holdings Ltd. will have a 14.7% stake and Mackenzie Financial
Corp. will own 26.4%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fairfax is a financial-services holding concern with
principal interests in the insurance business. It currently
owns 40.2% of Walwyn. Mackenzie Financial is one of Canada's
largest mutual fund managers. As part of the amalgamation of
Midland and Walywn, Mackenzie purchased seven million Walwyn
treasury shares for an aggregate price of 19.6 million
Canadian dollars (US$16.6 million).
   In the amalgamation, shareholders will receive one share
of Midland Walwyn for every 3.5 Walwyn shares held, or one
Midland Walwyn share for every two Midland shares held.
   Midland Walwyn will have a total of about 1,700 employees,
including about 700 registered representatives. H. Anthony
Arrell, who will be chairman and chief executive officer of
the new concern, said he expects it to be profitable in its
first 12 months of operation. Its latest quarter ending June
30, however, will include a C$30 million charge stemming from
costs of the merger. Both Walwyn and Midland had losses last
year.
   Two powerful Bay street players will continue to have
interests in the new investment dealer. Hees International
Bancorp, a merchant bank controlled by Toronto financiers
Peter and Edward Bronfman, will have an indirect interest
through its 22% stake in Unicorp Canada Corp., which controls
Union Enterprises. Gordon Capital Corp., an aggressive
investment dealer, will have a more than C$20 million stake
in Midland Walywn through its holding of Midland Doherty
debentures.
   James Moir, outgoing president of Midland Doherty, told
the Midland Doherty annual meeting that the merger would give
the two securities dealers the economies of scale they need
to compete. In the last five years, Canada's five biggest
banks have acquired seven of the largest Canadian investment
dealers, while foreign concerns have bought four firms and
established 10 Canadian subsidiaries, he said.

   People quoted in your article about the resurgence of
country clubs came across as the shallow, elite yuppies that
are so reviled by most of society today. Their reasons for
joining the clubs and the importance of being accepted said
much about their priorities.
   The most absurd quote, however, was by Kelvin Perry when
he complained that these overwhelmingly white country club
applicants "are shunning the melting pot that promotes racial
harmony." What makes this statement so absurd is that Mr.
Perry is president of the Black Chamber of Commerce of Kansas

we, Mr. Perry?

   Treasury Aide Is Watching

   WASHINGTON -- Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson
said in an interview that he is watching the country's credit
situation "very carefully" and has been trying to encourage
lenders and regulators to "use reason."
   So far Treasury officials don't see indications of a
nationwide credit crunch. But Mr. Robson, the second-highest
Treasury official, said, "There is a clear indication that
the credit availability of the real estate market is very
low, particularly with respect to commercial real estate."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The evidence of a credit squeeze seems contained to real
estate so far, Mr. Robson said. But he cautioned, "Remember
that if you look at credit data it is to some extent driven
by demand, and it's very hard to separate what loans aren't
being made because people aren't asking for loans that they
want very badly," but fear may be denied to them.
   Recent widespread reports that banks are tightening
lending standards have caused concern among some government
officials and private economists that credit could become so
pinched as to tip the economy into a recession. A number of
people believe that federal regulators' increased scrutiny of
lending practices, in the wake of the savings and loan
fiasco, has led banks to cut back on even prudent lending.

   Music: New Carter Violin Concerto

   San Francisco -- It is a civilized city in which one can
step out of one's hotel and purchase excellent cappuccino on
the street in brilliantly sunny May weather. But San
Francisco also is a nervous city; the young woman at the
espresso stand looked white as a ghost as she, zombielike,
ignored my order. A streetcar had just passed, slightly
shaking the ground underfoot, and she had imagined an
earthquake.
   Although the ground has been shaking a lot with small
tremors lately, that is not all that is shaking in a San
Francisco fighting to maintain its sophisticated image. For
one thing, the hotel I walked out of is a towering new
Marriott downtown that lights up a night skyline like a gaudy
jukebox. Then, across the Bay, there is the controversial
competition for a memorial to commemorate the 25th
anniversary of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley. A
conceptual artist has proposed declaring a cylinder of air
rising from a six-inch hole drilled into Sproul Plaza on the
University of California campus as air space that will not be
subject to any government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   No one, of course, could call into question the
uncompromising artistic purpose of the San Francisco Symphony
and its commissioning of a work from one of America's most
distinguished composers, Elliott Carter. Mr. Carter has
contributed something rare and dear to American music, a
major violin concerto. But even its premiere early this month
did not entirely escape gaudy commercialism and a bit of
rebellious anarchy.
   The anarchy came in the form of one patron who decided
that Davies Hall should not have to be a musically sovereign
space, choosing instead to listen to his loudly audible
walkman during the performance, until he was evicted.
   The commercialism issue was more bothersome and less
easily resolved. Mr. Carter's new concerto was sandwiched
between a program of classical chestnuts, Schubert's
"Unfinished" Symphony and Brahms's Second Symphony, works
that any orchestra knows well and should hardly have to
rehearse, leaving time to work on the very difficult new one.
But the San Francisco Symphony, which has been making some
splendid recordings lately with its music director, Herbert
Blomstedt, also was slated to record the "Unfinished"
following the concerts. So it was Schubert who received more
nuanced and caring attention than Mr. Carter.
   Still, the San Francisco Symphony is a classy operation,
one that often does live up to the cultured image that the
city loves to project. Mr. Blomstedt, for instance, can be
partially excused for accommodating his record company,
London Records, by devoting Carter time preparing for an
unnecessary "Unfinished." Apparently, even with 38 versions
of the Schubert symphony in print, a new one nonetheless
still can finance discs of composers such as Hindemith and
Nielsen, to whom the conductor is devoted. And probably
nothing better projects a sophisticated image for the
orchestra than Michael Steinberg's program notes.
Concert-goers come early to read them.
   In fact, it was Mr. Steinberg's luminous descriptions that
left one slightly disappointed with the performance, which
was capable but not poetic. Mr. Carter wrote the concerto for
the Norwegian violinist Ole Boehn because he liked Mr.
Boehn's fiery way with his Duo for Violin and Piano. But the
new concerto -- with its rapturous, soaring long solo lines
-- certainly will sound better when a violinist of less
coarse tone gets his bow on it.
   The half-hour work itself is, as one would expect from Mr.
Carter, difficult. Everywhere throughout the three movements
are zillions of details to absorb. But no composer organizes
confusion like Mr. Carter, and there are few experiences as
rewarding in modern music as the coming to terms with a
Carter score. It takes time, but as one eventually begins to
distinguish shapes throughout the intricate textures, as one
starts to piece together the whole of the broken solo violin
lines of the slow movement, one has the ineffable feeling of
comprehending something really important, the kind of feeling
astronomers must get when they begin to master the nighttime
sky.
   Such feelings remained rare for this listener with only
two hearings of the new concerto (a rehearsal run-through and
the first performance). It was hard to settle into the music
when the orchestra itself was not yet comfortable with it.
And although Mr. Boehn knew his notes, his was a crabbed,
eyes-to-the-page playing, occasionally exciting in a crude
way, but he never rose to the emotional grandeur of role Mr.
Carter created for him.
   Unfortunately, Mr. Boehn was a co-commissioner of the
concerto. That means that while we owe him a debt for
convincing Mr. Carter to write the work, we must regret that
Mr. Boehn has rights for all performances over the next year,
and he expects to take full advantage of them.
   The concerto will be performed by Mr. Boehn this weekend
at the Ojai Festival, near Los Angeles, where Mr. Carter will
be composer-in-residence. But there the circumstances will be
quite different. Instead of being squeezed between old
chestnuts, he will be paired with his present-day opposites,
the minimalists. The violin concerto will share the bill at
Ojai with Steve Reich's "The Desert Music."
   San Francisco is hopelessly uneasy with this mixing of yin
and yang (the new Marriott's occasional postmodern touches
are so cautiously applied to its basically anonymous interior
that they seem silly). But it goes down much easier in
Southern California. And maybe Mr. Boehn will lighten up a
little in that softer air.

   TOKYO -- Sony Corp. introduced what it claims is the
lightest and smallest camcorder on the market.
   Sony said its new TR-45 model weighs 690 grams, or about 1
1/2 pounds. The company said it trimmed 100 grams from the
weight of its popular TR-55, introduced last summer, by
developing a smaller image sensor and lens, and by reducing
the weight of other parts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The fully automatic TR-45 goes on sale in Japan on July 1
for 130,000 yen ($868), Sony officials said. It will be
introduced in the U.S. later in the summer and in Europe in
the fall, they said.
   Introduction of the compact TR-55 last year greatly
boosted world-wide demand for 8mm camcorders, and Sony
officials said they expect to sell more than three million
8mm machines this year.

   A Man From Troubled Times

   Six months after my first vote for Richard Nixon I'd
concluded it was a mistake. Dashing young president. Soaring
rhetoric. Stylish First Lady. Intellectuals in the White
House. Bear any burden. Country moving again. Enough of
Midwestern plain; let's all become beautiful people.
   November 1963 was bye-bye, Miss American Pie. The month
opened with the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. The U.S. had
sanctioned a coup against its ally; better to win the hearts
and minds of the people, the beautiful people said. The month
closed with the assassination of John F. Kennedy -- perhaps
in retaliation, I have come to suspect, for faux-tough plots
to assassinate Fidel Castro.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   (Later, of course, we also were to learn that Camelot had
its Pompadour, Judith Campbell Exner.) Lyndon Johnson, not a
beautiful person, had opposed the Diem coup, but he was left
to deal with its consequences -- battlefield chaos and a
vastly deepened American commitment. And guess what? The
beautiful people cut and ran.
   LBJ knew the Tet offensive was coming, but neglected to
warn the rest of us, so battlefield victory was perceived at
home as defeat. To deal with the mess, the American political
system searched deepest oblivion and found Richard Nixon. He
got out of Vietnam, more or less. He won a landslide
re-election, but tripped at Watergate. The beautiful people
finally got him; their reward was Ronald Reagan.
   This brief history of our times is prerequisite for coping
with Richard Nixon's new book, "In the Arena: A Memoir of
Victory, Defeat and Renewal" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 384 pages,
$21.95). President Nixon, of course, published an extensive
memoir, "RN," back in 1978, as well as five quite successful
books since. His new book might more aptly be described as
his reflections at age 77. And it might be understood as a
final foray, now that he's won a measure of rehabilitation,
in his life-long battle with the beautiful people.
   For at first blush, the overwhelming impression of the
book is banality. An elderly man draws on his rich
experiences to sketch McGuffey-reader lessons about family,
or religion or wealth or politics. All wrapped in
archetypical Nixon prose, a cross between a legal brief and
Reader's Digest, graceless but highly effective. And nowhere
is there a real surprise, a departure from the Nixon we've
alternately elected and hated.
   Nor is there any answer to questions we might like to ask
from the hindsight of the '90s: With a 30-point lead over the
hapless George McGovern, why didn't he confess everything
about the Watergate break-in and let it be washed away in the
electoral landslide? Given the part President Reagan's "Star
Wars" speech played in cracking the Soviet Union, was the ABM
treaty really a good idea? Given the damage still lingering
from the 1970s world inflation, any second thoughts about
scrapping the Bretton Woods monetary system? (In "RN," Mr.
Nixon described the closing of the gold window and floating
the dollar as, "one of the best things that came out of the
whole economic program" so fatefully formulated at Camp David
in August 1971.)
   In the end, though, the book's predictability becomes its
peculiar virtue. For at least in Mr. Nixon's mind his public
persona was stamped, and much of his subsequent career
foreordained, when he took on the establishment, the
administration and the media over Alger Hiss. He tells of a
newsman warning him, "The worst thing you can do to a member
of the press corps is to prove that he has been wrong on a
major issue"; and he observes, "That is precisely what I did
on the Hiss case, and it would not be the last time."
   He quotes a friend as saying that without the lingering
negative press from the Hiss case, he might have won the
presidential election in 1960. And he alludes to his wife:
"Losing in 1960 was a disappointment. But in her case, it was
doubly so because she believes to this day that the election
was stolen through vote fraud in Illinois and Texas." The
book does not mention the account of Earl Mazo, then of the
New York Herald-Tribune, that a defeated Nixon personally
persuaded him not to pursue this theme because it would
damage the presidency.
   "For bringing `peace' by accepting Communist domination of
Indochina, I might even have won the Nobel Peace Prize," Mr.
Nixon writes of opposition to his policy of gradual
withdrawal from Vietnam. "Ironically, anti-war critics still
label the Cambodian incursions, which saved lives and reduced
the Communists' ability to continue their attacks on our
forces, an `expansion' of the war." And with the Christmas
bombings of Hanoi, "one ex-prisoner told me, `we knew we were
finally going home.'" In the end, he writes, "The war was
winnable. We won the war but lost the peace"; by slashing aid
to South Vietnam and proscribing American bombing, "Congress
destroyed our ability to enforce the Paris agreement and left
our allies vulnerable to Hanoi's invading forces.
   "In retrospect, I would say that Watergate was one part
wrongdoing, one part blundering, and one part political
vendetta." He faults himself chiefly for not taking charge
and for deciding, while ill, not to burn the White House
tapes. He agrees that the famous "smoking gun" tape caught
him in "inexcusable error" in ordering the CIA to tell the
FBI that too much investigation of the break-in might reveal
national-security secrets, but says the order came to nothing
when CIA chiefs balked. He takes deep affront at a variety of
charges -- income-tax disputes, for example -- that swirled
in the vortex, and in particular at allegations against his
friends Bebe Robozo and Robert Abplanalp.
   Various readers will find this variously persuasive. As
some reviews of "In the Arena" already show, it will call the
beautiful people to the old ramparts. There also will be
doubts among those of us who, limited to that choice, take
the Nixon side. After reading his book, it's not easy to
accept that he has achieved the "inner peace" he claims in
his final chapter.
   Mr. Nixon himself must have suspended disbelief when he
wrote that, because since his resignation, he's not been
working at his personal rehabilitation, only serving a higher
cause. He obviously was delighted with Newsweek's "He's Back"
cover following his speech to publishers; as I recall, the
speech worked to ingratiate himself with the beautiful people
at the expense of the Reagan foreign policy.
   The rehabilitation has in fact been managed so
consummately that now Richard Nixon can once again speak his
mind. If he won't make his own brief, who will? In a way,
it's comforting to have back the Old Nixon, bloody but
unbowed.

   A Connecticut state court judge allowed Kollmorgen Corp.'s
issuance of some preferred stock to an investor group, but he
ordered the company to pay legal fees for Vernitron Corp.'s
attempt to block the transaction.
   Vernitron, a closely held Deer Park, N.Y., manufacturer of
motors and controls, has been trying to gain control of
Simsbury, Conn.-based Kollmorgen, which has similar
interests. Vernitron, which controls almost 6% of Kollmorgen,
has made a $15-a-share takeover proposal for half of
Kollmorgen's remaining shares outstanding and is waging a
proxy fight for control of its board. The companies are also
locked in litigation over a merger they earlier had agreed
upon; the plan collapsed last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In March, Kollmorgen sold the preferred, which is
convertible into 11.9% of the company on a fully diluted
basis, for $23.2 million to the investors. Vernitron sued to
block the issuance.
   Superior Court Judge Nicholas Cioffi said that the
investor group could vote the preferred at the annual meeting
tomorrow, but he said Kollmorgen should have submitted the
stock-issuance plan to the court for review before it was
completed. Kollmorgen plans to appeal the award of legal
fees.
   In allowing the stock issuance to stand, Judge Cioffi
followed the recommendations of a panel of special masters he
had appointed to help resolve the dispute over the preferred.
   The next step in the matter is tomorrow's vote by
Kollmorgen's shareholders for a board of directors. One
question is how Mario Gabelli, the New York money manager,
will vote the 16.29% Kollmorgen stake he controls.
   Mr. Gabelli couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
   Vernitron said yesterday that if its slate of directors is
elected, the new board would allow possible buyers of
Kollmorgen to submit takeover proposals either to the board
or directly to shareholders.
   Vernitron said that Kollmorgen currently requires
interested buyers to submit their proposals to the board, but
Kollmorgen called the assertion incorrect and said the
current board gives potential suitors the same two options.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Kollmorgen shares closed at $10.75, down 25 cents.

   PARIS -- Economic officials from 24 major industrial
countries will try to boost faltering multilateral trade
talks when they gather here today for the annual meeting of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   The U.S. is especially eager to galvanize the talks. "Our
window of opportunity is now," said White House Trade
Representative Carla Hills in a meeting with reporters here
yesterday. "It's just going to take the political will to do
it."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Similarly, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, speaking in
London before flying to Paris, said, "We are determined to
see these negotiations completed on time and with concrete
results."
   The trade talks, called the Uruguay Round, are designed to
establish rules to govern the approximately one-third of
world trade that isn't covered by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. Accomplishing that goal would mean
bringing agriculture, services, intellectual property,
textiles and trade-related investment under GATT's
jurisdiction, toughening GATT rules and fully integrating
developing countries into the 96-nation organization.
   The Uruguay Round talks are scheduled to be completed by
year end, but there are growing concerns that negotiators
won't be able to meet that timetable. Under U.S. law, the
talks must be finished by then or any legislation to put new
rules into effect won't qualify for streamlined, "fast-track"
consideration by Congress; that would be a severe blow to the
prospects for an accord.
   U.S. leaders are concerned that the European Community
won't be willing to commit itself to reduce agricultural
subsidies substantially. "I think it's important for {the EC}
to understand that agriculture is a key to the success of the
round," Mrs. Hills said.
   Just last week, President Bush said the U.S. sees
agricultural-trade reform as fundamental to the success of
the GATT talks, which began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in
1986. And he pointedly added that the U.S. would prefer
having no agreement to a bad one.
   Besides dealing with the GATT talks, economic officials
meeting here are expected to review recent developments in
the world economy, the transition to market economies in
Eastern Europe and environmental concerns. They also are
likely to discuss so-called tied-aid, which the U.S. is
trying to curtail. Tied aid is foreign assistance that
governments provide to developing countries on the condition
they buy goods from companies in the donor country.
   There also may soon be new members of the club of 24 rich
nations; both South Korea and Singapore are possible
candidates, according to OECD officials.
   Meanwhile yesterday, Treasury Secretary Brady and his
counterparts from about 40 other countries formally launched
the new European Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development in a
ceremony at the Elysee Palace. The EBRD, which will lend to
the new democracies in Eastern Europe and, to a very limited
extent, to the Soviet Union, is to be based in London.
   French President Francois Mitterrand's adviser Jacques
Attali will head the new institution, and an American is
expected to fill the No. 2 slot. But at his breakfast address
in London, Mr. Brady said "no decision has been made" on an
American deputy for Mr. Attali.
   President Mitterrand said he expects the bank to play a
"catalytic role" in helping the East bloc nations build
market economies. He called for the parliaments of the
participating nations to ratify the articles of agreement
promptly. The bank will begin formal operations once
two-thirds have done so.
   Separately, OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye this
week took a positive view of the state of the global economy,
but he added that there are "dark spots in the picture." In
its annual forecast released for the meeting, the OECD
predicted the economies of the 24-nation group will grow 2.9%
this year and next, after inflation. It forecast inflation at
4.4% in each of the next two years.
   The OECD isn't worried that German unification will
rekindle inflation. Indeed, the OECD predicted that even with
full economic unification, German inflation would rise to 3%
this year and 3.4% next -- comfortably below the OECD
average.
   But the OECD forecasts a rise in U.S. inflation to 4.2%
this year and 4.5% in 1991 from 4.1% in 1989. The
organization doesn't foresee a recession in the U.S. soon. It
predicts the U.S. economy will grow 2.3% this year and 2.5%
next year, after inflation.

   Yeltsin's Win Foreshadows End of Empire

   The election of Boris Yeltsin to the presidency of the
Russian republic is a stunning personal defeat for Mikhail
Gorbachev. For more than two years, Mr. Gorbachev has used
the propaganda mills of the Communist Party to discredit his
former Politburo colleague. Mr. Yeltsin's victory gives
further impetus to the social and political forces that are
tearing apart the last great empire.
   From the platform of the Russian presidency, Mr. Yeltsin
is certain to strike a triple blow against Mr. Gorbachev's
political line. He will challenge the Soviet president on the
question of economic reform -- Mr. Yeltsin favors a "no" vote
on the Soviet government's referendum on economic austerity.
Mr. Yeltsin will also oppose the policy of imperial
centralism that holds the republics in the thrall of the
central ministries that control nearly 95% of economic
output. As a leader elected by a legislature that is the
product of the most open election the Soviet Union has seen,
he will challenge the legitimacy of Mr. Gorbachev's
presidency, perhaps to the point of forcing a new unionwide
election.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In recent months Mr. Yeltsin has positioned himself as a
tradition-oriented politician looking back to basic Russian
values and lamenting the destruction of the Russian village.
His electoral platform and the movement that supported him --
Democratic Russia -- represents an inward-looking Russian
nationalism that promotes Russia's sovereignty against the
state apparat and has little in common with Russian
imperialism.
   On May 4, while visiting Spain, Mr. Yeltsin criticized Mr.
Gorbachev's blockade of Lithuania. A Spanish newspaper
reported that he also called for the emergence of "an
independent Russian republic" that "as an independent state
would sign agreements with other republics, also as
independent states." In Mr. Yeltsin's view, it would then be
up to the various sovereign republics to determine whether
they should be part of a federation or confederation, or
fully independent.
   Among non-Russian peoples fighting for economic and
political sovereignty, the Yeltsin victory is greeted with
unalloyed delight. One leader of Sajudis, the Lithuanian
independence movement, anticipated Mr. Yeltsin's success when
I met him in late April. "He'll sign a trade agreement
between Russia and Lithuania. He'll challenge the blockade,"
the Lithuanian leader predicted. Just three months ago, in an
interview in an Estonian daily, Mr. Yeltsin came out
four-square for "maximum independence" for the republics.
   Independence-minded Georgians and Azerbaijanis, too,
regard Mr. Yeltsin favorably. He is on record denouncing the
brutal murders of non-Russian demonstrators by Soviet troops
in 1989 and 1990, and has gone after Marshal Dmitri Yazov,
who, says Mr. Yeltsin, "must answer for Tbilisi and Baku."
   Mr. Yeltsin's victory shows how far the process of
democratization and radicalization has gone in the past 15
months. It also shows Mr. Yeltsin's keen political sense. Mr.
Yeltsin and his reformist cohorts scored their electoral
victory in March elections to Russia's Parliament by playing
to a major shift in Russian public opinion, which is warming
to the idea of surrendering domination of non-Russian
peoples.
   There are many important signs of this turn inward. A
public-opinion poll conducted in late February by the Soviet
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Sociology in cities across
the Soviet Union indicated that 52.4% of those polled
supported the right of union republics to secede. Another 14%
partly endorsed this right and only 7% were clearly opposed.
Ethnic Russians are opting out of the empire with their feet
and leaving the non-Russian republics in droves. Between 1979
and 1989, nearly two million citizens -- most of them ethnic
Russians -- left the non-Russian republics to return to the
Russian republic.
   As president of a republic of 147 million, Mr. Yeltsin
will be confronted with a new constituency -- the 25 million
Russians who live in the non-Russian republics. Mr. Yeltsin
realizes that this group could represent a force for the
maintenance of empire. But, to diffuse this time bomb, Mr.
Yeltsin, according to reports in the Soviet press, favors a
"law of return." Such a law would, in effect, include a
transitional program for the orderly withdrawal of worried
Russians from the non-Russian republics.
   On the political front, Mr. Yeltsin will be an advocate of
a multiparty system and an opponent of Lenin's principle of
"democratic centralism." He already has called for
dismantling the Communist Party's vast salaried apparat and
supplanting it with a party based largely on volunteers and
democratically accountable officials. He also will work for
the "depoliticization" of the army, the Interior Ministry and
the KGB "by eliminating the political organs in them" and
breaking officer links with the Communist Party.
   On the economic front, Mr. Yeltsin's thinking is a bit
fuzzier. He opposes half-hearted reforms that impose
austerities on Soviet workers. His economic prescriptions
include a rapid transition to currency convertibility from
the current three-tiered monetary structure. In Mr. Yeltsin's
view, enterprises that produce goods in excess of state
orders could sell their products on the free market. Any
proceeds from sales would be in the form of a single currency
with which enterprises could improve wages, increase capital
investments and purchase needed consumer goods for workers
and for workplace-related educational facilities.
   Whether Mr. Yeltsin is the leader of the future, however,
remains to be seen. While he is popular with the Soviet
public, the new Russian president is regarded by younger
radicals, who backed his bid for office, as a man of limited
ability. He may well turn out to be a Soviet version of Imre
Posgay, the radical Hungarian Communist reformer who laid the
groundwork for democracy in his country in 1989 and then was
defeated in his quest for his country's presidency by an
ungrateful electorate.
   This is the second time that Mikhail Gorbachev embarks on
a U.S. visit while facing a challenge from a formidable
political rival. The last time he was here that rival was the
arch-conservative Yegor Ligachev, whom Mr. Gorbachev would
later outmaneuver and defeat. This time, with Boris Yeltsin,
he may not be as lucky. But at least he's prepared. Just a
couple of weeks ago, the Soviet Parliament passed a law
guaranteeing a pension, "dacha" and private limousine for
retired Soviet presidents.

   MORGAN'S FOODS Inc. said it will begin a rights offering
to shareholders as soon as it is approved at its annual
meeting next month. The company's board last week approved a
rights offering that would give each holder the right to
purchase for $1 a share one common share for each two already
held. Morgan's said shareholders must vote to increase the
number of authorized common shares to 25 million from 15
million. Proceeds of the rights offering would be used to
reduce bank debt and other general purposes, the company
said. Morgan's Foods, which is based in Cleveland, is a
national franchisee of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.
The company has about 11.7 million shares outstanding.

   Buyers of Golf Art
   Want Lots of Golf,
   Not Too Much Art

   Collectors and Artists Defend
   Game as Worthy of Both
   Masters and Masterpieces

   On the front wall hangs a picture of a hole with a little
flag sticking out of it. On the side wall hangs a picture of
a hole with a little flag sticking out of it. Across the room
is a picture of a hole with a little flag sticking out of it.
It is a sign of the times that James Olman's Cincinnati
gallery is devoted exclusively to a genre conspicuously
underrepresented in the nation's finest museums: golf art.
   In the past few years, art depicting golf has been
furiously painted, printed, reproduced and sold at ever
higher prices. As a game, golf is enjoying some fresh
popularity. Art prices have been rising. Link the two
together and the result is expensive golf art, like the late
19th-century oil, "The Cheerful Caddy Boy," a portrait of a
smiling urchin in baggy pants carrying a set of clubs. It
recently sold for more than $15,000 to Jeff Jennings, a
collector of golf art in Greenwich, Conn., who says with some
pride, "I had a caddy boy like that when I golfed at the
Gleneagles course in Scotland."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Modern golf artists are also cashing in on golf-art mania.
Some say they have enough commissions to paint golf holes for
the rest of their lives. Golf museums report increased
traffic, and, says one curator, people stand longer in front
of each golf painting.
   Golf art strikes art purists as kitsch. "Golf art is for
duffers who can't quite pull their britches up anymore," says
W. Graham Arader III, a New York art dealer who specializes
in European and American art of the 16th to 19th centuries.
Golf art "can look horrible, but if Bobby Jones once rubbed
up against it in a locker room in Brisbane, Australia, it's
priceless," Mr. Arader says. "People pay crazy prices for
this stuff, but I've never seen a piece of golf art I'd hang
in my home."
   Golf artists scoff at this misguided snobbery. "It's
definitely art," says LeRoy Neiman, the sports artist whose
own golf oeuvre includes the radiant "Arnie {as in Palmer} in
the Rain." Taking a world view, he adds, "People are just
going to have to adjust to it as they have to other modern
problems."
   The people who buy golf art tend to be the kinds of
golfers who watch pro tournaments on TV, play at least 18
holes a week and are apt to relive great golf moments (their
own) over drinks in the clubhouse -- relishing the 300-yard
drive, the brilliant seven-iron shot from the rough and the
final victorious 20-foot putt that causes their opponents to
weep from envy. To them, golf art is a kind of nostalgia
trip, a chance to remember their own games on the world's
great courses; or, having once glimpsed a golf god like Mr.
Palmer, a chance to frame the magic of the moment in their
office, den or rec room.
   For this reason, most golf art depicts either the great
players -- Bobby Jones, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan and Arnold
Palmer are the most popular -- or the great holes, the 16th
at Augusta National or the 16th at Cypress Point, for
example. (Actually, these holes are not necessarily the best
ones, golf artists say; they're popular because they're
short, treacherous and provide the most drama on televised
tournaments.)
   It also figures that the favored style of golf art is
realism, although some artists have experimented with
pointillism, surrealism and fantasy -- four golfing dogs
perched on hind legs or whimsical golf holes depicted in the
Okefenokee Swamp or in the middle of Wall Street. Golf art
also has its share of still lifes, such as Brenda Turner's
watercolors of artfully arranged clubs, balls, tees and a
blank scorecard on which a golfer can record one of his own
memorable games.
   But essentially, buyers of golf art want lots of golf and
not too much art. "You get a little artist's license to move
the odd tree or bush around," says Bill Waugh, a Scottish
golf artist, "but basically it has to be the golf course as
the golfer remembers it."
   Mr. Waugh, a self-taught water-colorist, says that if
anyone saw him at work, "they'd kill themselves laughing."
With art texts at his side, Mr. Waugh works from photos or
sketches, often for Japanese or American clients who
commission him to paint their favorite holes. Mr. Waugh says
he has heard of an American painter who, for $50,000, will
paint a golfer playing his favorite hole. However, the artist
will only paint a back view, Mr. Waugh hears, because he
hasn't mastered face or hand technique.
   Although Mr. Waugh claims never to get bored painting one
golf hole after another, he does say that he could do it in
his sleep. "You do do it in your sleep," volunteers Mr.
Waugh's wife. On the subject of the color green, Mr. Waugh
gets a bit testy. "I get fed up with green," he says. "I
really get fed up with painting greens."
   The success of people like Mr. Waugh has taken many other
aspiring golf artists off the links and into the studio, with
some unfortunate results. Mr. Olman, whose gallery receives
scores of unsolicited pieces a year, points to a group of
drawings that recently arrived of elephants swinging at golf
balls. His critical eye immediately spots a serious flaw: The
elephants are all swinging left-handed. "The market for
left-handed golfers is much smaller than the right-handed
market," says Mr. Olman, shaking his head in disgust. "The
artist, clearly not a golfer, had no idea."
   When confronted by art's equivalent of a whiff, Mr. Olman
shows no mercy. One print, of a chubby little girl swinging a
club in a field, didn't attract any buyers as art, so Mr.
Olman slapped the prints on some wastebaskets and sold them
as golf-theme trash receptacles, which have been moving quite
nicely.
   Early golf art (pre-1930) isn't necessarily better, it is
just more rare, and expensive. Traditionally, golf art has
hung in the clubhouses of country or golf clubs, and many of
the old clubs have burned down at least once over the
decades. (St. Andrews in Scotland, made of stone, is a
notable exception.) Many paintings have gone up in flames.
   Devotees of golf art say courses are beautiful landscapes,
manicured and pampered like no other land on Earth. "Players
and spectators walk out there wearing
orange-and-green-striped shirts, purple shoes, red socks, and
no one even looks twice," says Mr. Neiman. "So when the
gallery rings the green, it's like a bed of flowers." Walking
a misty fairway in the solitude of early morning is like
walking through the pearly gates, golf artists say.
   Golf is also exciting, argue the sport's fans, and there
is a growing body of art to illustrate it. Austin Cragg,
owner of Commemorative Golf Galleries in Greenwich, Conn., is
creating a series of prints of 560 major moments in golf. Mr.
Cragg's first such moment was a depiction of Gene Sarazin
making his "Shot Heard 'Round the World." This is not to be
confused with Tom Watson's "Chip Shot Heard 'Round the
World," by artist Michael Lane.
   Golf dealers, artists and collectors agree that golf is a
game of the wealthy, the people who can most afford to
collect art. "Golf is a major investment in a lot of
respects," says Mr. Olman, "and people become more involved
in it partly because of that." But it's not the only reason.
Mr. Jennings, the collector, says he has a photograph of
himself golfing at Muirfield in Scotland on his office wall.
"I hit this great shot on the last hole," he remembers
fondly. "It happened to be an important shot, and I won a lot
of money. I have every intention of hiring an artist and
saying, `Do it up.' "

   A Privatization Program for Gorbachev

   When Mikhail Gorbachev arrives here tonight he will be
pursuing more than trade and arms agreements. He, like other
leaders from nonmarket economies, is seeking techniques to
move to a market system. Here is one idea for privatizing
East Bloc industry.
   To initiate a market system, these countries must create
private owners for enterprises previously owned by the
people. No capital market exists, however, for selling stock
in existing enterprises. Moreover, few, if any, citizens can
purchase even a limited amount of government-owned plants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although selling these operations to foreign interests is
technically feasible, it raises two major obstacles. First,
there is no good way to value the assets. Second, the public
would fear that foreigners were buying up the nation. To
succeed, a privatization must establish a process that
appears to be fair to the public, the people who, in theory,
own these assets now. My modest proposal would meet these
objections.
   It is not enough for the government to privatize. In most
of these countries, the state has, over time, established
major conglomerates with numerous subsidiaries. If these
combines were simply transferred to private hands, the result
would be a handful of gigantic monopolies that would fail to
provide a competitive system.
   The first step for the government, therefore, would be to
divide each conglomerate into as many potentially viable
enterprises as possible. Business relations among the former
parts of the conglomerate should continue, as before, until
the privatization is complete.
   Once the government ministries create separate firms, each
manager of an enterprise would determine the number of shares
of stock to be offered to the public. The actual number is
unimportant since the market will set the value of each
share. To provide for widespread ownership, a minimum of
10,000 shares would seem reasonable. The managers would also
publish a financial report with as much information as
possible about the business. To minimize the temptation to
manipulate the data, the law should prohibit managers and
their families from bidding on shares in their own
enterprises. This, however, would not prevent managers from
buying into other firms, or buying into their own after this
first phase.
   The government would prepare a schedule of a limited
number of facilities to be privatized each week. Although it
is important to privatize as much of the economy as quickly
as possible, individuals who fail to secure shares in the
first round should have an opportunity in later rounds.
   Under this plan, the state would give each adult a voucher
for 1,000 units. Again, the actual number is not important.
(I would recommend giving children age five to 17 half the
allocation of adults; younger children, 10%. Parents would
exercise these units.)
   The units would be good only for purchasing shares of
government facilities. Individuals would bid for shares --
e.g., 10 units per share for 50 shares of XYZ Co. After the
bids, the firms would allocate the equity according to the
highest bids. The lowest price that cleared the market would
be the price for all. If no one bid on the shares for an
enterprise, the government would give the equity to the
workers.
   Individuals could sell their units, but only to other
nationals. Those that did not want to participate in the
bidding could sell their units to the more entrepreneurial.
Ideally, some people would come forward to make a market in
these units. However, if that failed to happen, the
government would provide a clearing house where buyers and
sellers could trade units. Alternatively, the government
could contract with a Western securities firm to make a
market in the units and perhaps to start making a market in
the stock after the initial allocation. The trading would lay
the foundation for a stock exchange.
   The 10 largest stockholders, together with the three top
administrators of the facility, would become the original
board of directors. These directors would have the authority
to hire and fire the management and make general policy for
the enterprise. This would provide for both continuity and
new blood. If stock were too evenly divided to have 10 large
stockholders, the directors could be chosen by lot from the
largest stockholders. In any case, the original directors
would hold office only until an election of directors within
the first year of privatization.
   Once the shares in an enterprise were distributed, the
stock could be sold for cash. For two years, the law would
limit foreigners to 49% of the equity. After two years, no
limit on foreign ownership would be imposed.
   If there is a strong need for revenue, the government
could use this approach to privatize only a portion of the
ownership of enterprises. The state would retain minority
ownership until a genuine market in the shares has developed.
   This proposal would resolve many of the difficulties that
the former communist states must overcome in moving assets
quickly into the private sector. Until East European
countries privatize a significant portion of their economy
they will be unable to secure the benefits of a market
economy. Eliminating the need to value the assets would
accelerate the process. The market would do that task.
Endowing everybody with a claim on the firms to be privatized
would mitigate opposition and build support. In the process,
the rudiments of a stock exchange would develop.

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian House of Commons passed abortion
legislation that allows doctors to decide whether an abortion
should be performed.
   Canada has been without an abortion law since the Canadian
Supreme Court struck down the previous one more than two
years ago, because it was deemed to infringe upon women's
constitutional rights. Under the former legislation,
abortions had to be approved by a hospital abortion
committee, which often caused delays in the abortion
procedure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new bill would allow an abortion if a doctor believes
that a woman's "physical, mental or psychological health"
would be threatened should the pregnancy continue.
   The new law has been criticized by anti-abortion groups,
who say it is too lax, and by abortion-rights advocates, who
claim it will discourage doctors from performing abortions.
   Canadian Justice Minister Kim Campbell said the bill was
drafted "to achieve a delicate balance between the
conflicting views" on abortion. She said it provides
safeguards for Canadian women and reflects "society's
interest in the protection of the fetus."
   The bill, which was approved by a vote of 140 to 131 in
the House of Commons yesterday, must be approved by the
Senate, the appointed chamber of Parliament.

   Westinghouse's
   New Chief Must
   Foster Growth

   PITTSBURGH -- Paul E. Lego's appointment as Westinghouse
Electric Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer,
expected today, could put the company on a growth course.
   Mr. Lego, currently the No. 2 executive, will be taking
over at the helm of the nearly $13 billion corporation at a
crossroads in its 104-year-old history. Westinghouse has
scrambled from perilous litigation stemming from uranium
contracts in the 1970s to prominence among the Dow Jones
Industrials in the 1980s as it chopped underperforming
businesses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But now Mr. Lego's challenge will be to selectively expand
what's left, most likely through acquisitions. Under the
current chief executive, John C. Marous Jr., who reaches the
mandatory retirement age of 65 on June 9, Westinghouse
achieved financial success but little focus. Its unrelated
businesses range from broadcasting and financial services to
the manufacture of refrigeration and power generation
equipment.
   Mr. Lego, who has spent 34 of his 60 years at
Westinghouse, isn't giving any hints of what's in store. The
low-profile executive declined to be interviewed for this
story. Moreover, although Mr. Lego has been considered the
heir apparent since his selection as president in January
1988, Westinghouse insiders say he has maintained an even
lower profile this year out of respect for Mr. Marous, in
whose footsteps he has followed for two decades.
   Partly due to the unknowns about Mr. Lego, Wall Street is
already uneasy. Rumors have swirled about possible
acquisition candidates that the executive -- a onetime
electrical engineer and strategic planner -- might be
considering.
   One such candidate is Sundstrand Corp., a $1.6 billion
maker of aerospace parts based in Rockford, Ill.
Westinghouse, which makes radar and other sophisticated
avionics, won't comment on Sundstrand. But analysts don't
rule out the possibility of a bid because of Sundstrand's
strategic fit with Westinghouse. Still, that troubles some
because a third of Sundstrand's revenue comes from the
Pentagon, which likely will spend less for military hardware
in coming years. They also question whether Westinghouse,
which prefers to shop for bargain-priced acquisitions, would
pay a hefty premium for Sundstrand.
   There also is some skittishness about Mr. Lego himself.
Earlier this month, Westinghouse stock tumbled several points
after the executive met with industry analysts in Palm Beach,
Fla. While his outlook wasn't much different from earlier
presentations, some analysts found Mr. Lego to be more
reserved and guarded than Mr. Marous and felt he was
outstaged by counterparts at General Electric Co. and Emerson
Electric Co.
   One of Mr. Lego's biggest supporters, former Westinghouse
Chairman Douglas Danforth, says analysts expected Mr. Lego to
present his vision of where Westinghouse was headed, but Mr.
Danforth said that would have been premature because Mr. Lego
wasn't yet the chairman. "As any CEO, you have a challenge in
convincing the investment community that the company is in
good hands. Paul will be able to handle those things with no
problem," he predicts.
   Robert W. McCoy, an analyst at UBS Securities Inc., told
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that "people came away
somewhat concerned about the direction of the company under
new management." Now Mr. McCoy has had second thoughts:
"Paul's personality isn't as outgoing as Danforth or Marous.
We have to get used to his style."
   The son of a steelworker, Mr. Lego was born and raised in
a small town near Johnstown, Pa., where he met his wife at a
square dance.
   He joined Westinghouse in 1956, laboring as an electrical
engineer in relative obscurity until 1970. That year, he
succeeded Mr. Marous as general manager of the company's
semiconductor division.
   In that job, Mr. Lego caught the eye of Mr. Danforth, his
superior. Mr. Danforth says he probably had a hand in five or
six of Mr. Lego's subsequent promotions. "One thing that
impressed me was that he was able to disagree with his
superiors in the right way and he stayed with his beliefs.
Any strong leader has to have those traits if he's to
succeed," Mr. Danforth says.
   Though Mr. Lego has had a long relationship with Mr.
Marous, the two men have sharply contrasting styles. While
traveling on company planes, for example, Mr. Lego is known
for burying himself in paper work. Mr. Marous uses the time
to hold court, summoning subordinates and grilling them one
by one in the seat facing him at the front of the aircraft.
   Unlike Mr. Marous, Mr. Lego isn't one for chit chat.
Maurice C. Sardi, an executive vice president, recalls that
he once sent Mr. Lego a report that was short on substance.
In response, Mr. Lego shot back a sarcastic note. "The key is
that Paul's disciplined and organized," says Mr. Sardi.
"Sometimes guys tend to gloss over things at the senior
level, but he'll pore over the briefing materials. He doesn't
allow anything not to be answered. He's very penetrating."
   The upshot, Mr. Sardi maintains, is that when Mr. Lego
reviews a proposal, "he'll add value, make it better."
   Mr. Lego has been called cold and abrasive. But in a
recent company brochure, he said: "I used to attack people
without thinking too much about how that might be perceived.
Most of us tend to look for people in our mold and view them
more positively than others. I've learned that good people
come in all different molds and temperaments."
   Westinghouse officials claim that Mr. Lego, who starts his
day with a five-mile jog and is at work by 7 a.m., is easy to
work for mostly because he's so disciplined. He encourages
managers to draw up lists of goals, and then works with them
to achieve them. As a result, managers say they always know
where they stand and that Mr. Lego doesn't take credit for
their achievements.
   Mr. Lego shares his view of leadership with a Chinese
philosopher named Lao-tzu. In a speech last June to the
Duquesne Club here, he said Lao-tzu "believed that a leader
is most effective when people don't realize they are being
led. It means that your program has to be so well seated in
the organization that people follow it automatically."
   Now, with Westinghouse at a point where it needs to be
fine-tuned, Mr. Lego is ideally suited for the task at hand,
says Robert F. Pugliese, executive vice president of legal
and corporate affairs. "I've worked for four of
Westinghouse's 13 chairmen," he says. "Paul is the best thing
to happen to us in today's environment. I'm not shilling for
him, I really mean that."

   L.M. Ericsson Expects
   To Boost 1990 Profit
   By More Than 25%

   STOCKHOLM -- LM Ericsson, buoyed by strong growth in its
phone-switching equipment and cellular radio-systems
businesses, plans to boost its profit by more than 25% this
year.
   However, Lars Ramquist, Ericsson's president and chief
executive officer, declined to predict revenue growth.
Although revenue rose by 30% in the first quarter, there is
increasing pressure from falling prices in the world
telecommunications equipment market, the executive explained.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're running full speed now," said Mr. Ramquist. But he
cautioned, "I'm concerned that we are doing so well that it
could go away easily. No tree grows to heaven." He added that
the company should split its stock 5-1 by mid-September.
   He said Ericsson faces numerous hurdles in the 1990s,
chief among them the challenge of remaining a major player in
the European market. Ericsson derives 70% of its more than $6
billion in annual revenue from Western Europe. But since
Sweden isn't a member of the Common Market, Ericsson could
feel a squeeze on its business as Europe moves to lower
market barriers after 1992.
   "We {come from} such a small country . . . that we will
always have to fight uphill" against rivals such as West
Germany's Siemens and France's Alcatel, he said.
   Mr. Ramquist, 52 years old, rose through Ericsson's ranks
from its Radio Systems business, where the company has posted
some of its biggest gains in recent years, capturing 40% of
the world market for cellular network systems. He took his
new position only three weeks ago.
   Mr. Ramquist said Ericsson's core business has a strong
order book that should enable it to navigate competition from
such rivals as Siemens and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   On the radio systems side, Mr. Ramquist said orders in the
U.S. for cellular network systems remain strong. But he's
also counting on a new joint venture with General Electric
Co. to boost Ericsson's share of the cellular subscriber
phone business.

   TAIPEI -- Taiwan's economic performance has shown signs of
a slowdown as the coincident-composite index dropped in April
for the third consecutive month and more manufacturers became
pessimistic toward the local economy.
   The Council for Economic Planning and Development said the
coincident-composite index, which measures economic activity
for the current month, fell in April to 130.33, against 131.9
the previous month and 133.96 in April 1989. The
month-on-month decline of 1.19% compares with a drop of 0.58%
and 0.02% in the March and February data respectively.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Capacity utilization in April reached 76.5%, down from
77.8% in March.
   Among manufacturers interviewed by the council, 18% of
those surveyed said they expect Taiwan's economy to improve
during the next three months, down from 21% in March.

   Harcourt Names John S. Herrington,
   An Unknown in Publishing, as Chairman

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. named John S. Herrington, a
former U.S. Secretary of Energy and an unknown in the
publishing industry, as chairman, succeeding William
Jovanovich, the iconoclastic publishing legend.
   At the same time, Peter Jovanovich, president and chief
executive officer of the debt-laden publishing and insurance
concern, succeeded the elder Mr. Jovanovich, his father, as
chairman of the executive committee at a board meeting in New
York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Industry experts said the moves may signal a recognition
at Harcourt that it must take steps to deal with its debt
problem. "Bill Jovanovich is a legend, and he's a very astute
publishing executive, but he's not a financial executive and
this company is deeply mired in financial problems," said
Charles Elbaum, president of Publishing Economics Inc., a
consulting firm in New York. "It's a different situation
now."
   Under the stewardship of William Jovanovich, Harcourt grew
from a company with $8 million in annual sales and 125
employees in the mid-1950s to one with more than $1.27
billion in sales and more than 11,000 employees when he
stepped down last year as chief executive. In 1987, however,
his stellar career turned a corner when he saddled the
company with more than $2 billion in debt in an effort to
fend off a hostile takeover effort by British publisher
Robert Maxwell.
   Many industry experts see his strong-willed triumph over
Mr. Maxwell as a Pyrrhic victory that may yet spell the
demise of Harcourt. To reduce debt, Harcourt has already had
to shed assets, including its Sea World theme parks that it
sold last year for $1.1 billion, a price that Wall Street
analysts called disappointing.
   Most recently, Harcourt considered a possible sale of
assets to Thomson Corp., a Toronto publishing and travel
concern, but according to those familiar with the matter, the
possibility of a deal was dashed by a rise in bond prices
that made it prohibitively expensive for Harcourt to buy back
certain debt, a linchpin of the planned transaction.
   In interviews, Mr. Herrington and Peter Jovanovich said
they face twin challenges: restoring the company's
pre-eminence as a textbook publisher and fashioning a
solution to its staggering debt load. While their projects
will overlap, the 51-year-old Mr. Herrington said he expects
to focus on resolving the financial problems, while Mr.
Jovanovich said he will dedicate himself to "meeting the
challenge of editorial excellence."
   Mr. Herrington, who was energy secretary under President
Reagan from 1985 to 1989, conceded that he knows little about
publishing, but he anticipates that his skills in managing
big budgets and large staffs as well as balancing conflicting
interests should help in straightening out the company's
money problems.
   "In structuring a debt solution, we have a lot of issues
-- none of which are publishing-related but, rather, are
mainly financial," Mr. Herrington said.
   Mr. Herrington, a California real estate developer and
business lawyer, is a member of Harcourt's executive
committee and finance committee. Mr. Herrington was
associated with Mr. Reagan during the latter's California
administration and served as special assistant to the chief
of staff at the White House. Mr. Herrington is currently
treasurer and chairman of the building committee of the
Reagan Foundation and is overseeing the construction of a $60
million presidential library.
   Some Wall Street analysts were skeptical of his prospects
for helping Harcourt. "It's all very well to have Mr. Energy
come out of the woodwork on a flaming chariot, but it doesn't
make very much sense," said Ivan Obolensky, senior vice
president of Josephthal &amp; Co. and a longtime bear on
Harcourt.
   Both Mr. Herrington and the younger Mr. Jovanovich said
they will explore all options in approaching the debt
problem, but they emphasized the company's goal of being a
strong, independent and U.S.-owned publisher.
   Both men also took pains to emphasize that the departure
of the elder Mr. Jovanovich, who is 70 years old, was simply
an orderly transition of power, not a sign of rough times in
the board room. "My father has chosen a rather natural
process," the 41-year-old Peter Jovanovich said. "In 1988, he
stepped down as president, in 1989 he stepped down as CEO,
and in 1990 he's left as chairman."
   The departure of William Jovanovich is also seen by some
observers as allowing Peter Jovanovich to emerge from his
father's shadow and to consolidate his authority at the
company. The younger Mr. Jovanovich wouldn't comment on that
speculation.
   Mr. Herrington, a Walnut Creek, Calif., attorney and
businessman who joined the Harcourt board in 1989, said the
elder Mr. Jovanovich approached him about a month ago to
inquire whether he would consider becoming a candidate for
the chairman's post when it came open.
   As is characteristic, William Jovanovich declined through
company spokesmen to be interviewed. However, in what appears
to be a shift from its typical media-shy nature, Harcourt
retained the public-relations firm of Hill &amp; Knowlton to
assist in making the announcement about the changes.
   The elder Mr. Jovanovich, born in a Colorado coal camp to
immigrant parents in 1920, started out as a textbook salesman
and editor in 1947 and in eight years rose to the post of
president. He has written numerous essays and five books,
including four novels and plans to publish another novel,
"The World's Last Night," in August. He has edited works by
Mary McCarthy, Milton Friedman and Charles A. Lindbergh,
among others, and plans to keep a hand in editing.

   Dollar, Mark Rebound Against the Yen
   On Lingering Nervousness About Japan

   NEW YORK -- The yen reversed its recent course, falling
against the mark and dollar on the belief that its gains late
last week were overdone in light of lingering uncertainty
about yen investments.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6740 marks, down from 1.6824 marks late Friday, and at
151.25 yen, up from 149.40 yen late Friday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6940, up from $1.6905.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At mid-morning Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading
at 150.75 yen, up a bitfrom Tuesday's Tokyo close of 150.70
yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6738
marks.
   The yen was little changed against the mark and dollar
Monday in the absence of U.S. and British participants from
the market.
   While dealers generally agreed the yen will appreciate
against the dollar and mark over the long term, some
nervousness persists about Japan's stock and real-estate
markets, leading to what traders expect will be a fitful,
gradual rise of the yen.
   The yen will rise on the strength of Japan's robust
economy, which appears attractive in light of the U.S.
slowdown and the economic uncertainties surrounding German
unification, participants said.
   But short-term nervousness over Japan was highlighted by a
373.94-point drop of the Nikkei stock index to 32817.67
points Tuesday in Tokyo after several straight days of
advances, they said. The Nikkei gained 397.73 points Monday.
   "Japan still is not a tremendous arena for investment"
owing to nervousness over the stock market, which dropped 23%
in the first quarter before rebounding; the large amount of
debt secured by overpriced real estate; and the country's
recent political problems, said Carl Amendola, a vice
president at Bayerische Hypothekenund Wechsel-Bank AG in New
York.
   Despite signs that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has
consolidated power and has the strength to provide Japan with
effective leadership, some in the market are still wary
because of Mr. Kaifu's lack of a well-established power base
within the Liberal Democratic Party.
   Concern about Japanese financial institutions' large
exposure to real-estate secured debt has waxed in recent
weeks amid reports that the high Japanese land prices of
recent years may have peaked.
   The lack of a high confidence level in yen investments has
been masked somewhat by the current wave of bargain-hunting
for Japanese stocks after the Tokyo stock market's recent
losses, Mr. Amendola noted.
   Dealers in Tokyo said that yen selling against the mark
gained steam in early Tokyo trading on rumors that an Asian
central bank had bought marks and that the West German
central bank would soon raise interest rates.
   Helping the mark to post gains against the dollar and the
yen were a series of encouraging inflation reports for May
released over the past few days by the most economically
important West German states, participants said. The mark
finished at 90.34 yen, up from 89.01 yen late Monday in
Frankfurt.
   The moderate inflation news helped the mark because the
market is more interested in seeing German unification
proceed as smoothly as possible than it is in seeing
inflation push up interest rates, said Kevin Logan, chief
economist at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York.
   Higher cost-of-living rates would have reinforced the
notion of inflation as a potential danger to the smooth
conclusion of economic integration, Mr. Logan said. The drive
toward integration has been a bullish factor for the mark.
   Activity in the dollar is expected to remain muted until
Friday's employment report for May, traders said. The lack of
any real chances for a change in the Federal Reserve's
neutral stance on U.S. interest rates is seen leaving the
dollar becalmed for lack of trading impulses.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $367.40 an ounce, down 80 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $366.65 an
ounce.

   MILAN -- Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. reported that 1989
consolidated net profit after minority interests fell 45% to
311 billion lire ($251.8 million) from 561 billion lire the
year earlier.
   Ferruzzi Finanziaria, Italy's leading agro-industrial
group, attributed the decline to the extraordinary loss of
$128.7 million incurred by its soybean trading division last
summer. Ferruzzi also said the result reflected a higher
corporate tax rate and radical changes in the group's
structure following the transfer of chemical assets to
Enimont S.p.A. last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ferruzzi also announced plans to buy back as much as 150
billion lire of its shares.
   Because of the radical changes in the group's structure
following the foundation of Enimont last year, Ferruzzi said
it restated 1988 results to enable a comparison with last
year's earnings figures. Montedison, which is controlled by
the Ferruzzi group through Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria
S.p.A., ceded the bulk of its chemical activities to Enimont
last year.
   The earnings announcement also was the first time the
company revealed the full impact of its clash with the
Chicago Board of Trade last summer over its accumulation of
soybean contracts, although Ferruzzi had predicted in
September the loss would amount to about $100 million.
Ferruzzi was forced to sell off futures contracts totaling
some 23 million bushels of soybeans.

   Who's News:
   Harvard's Bok
   Will Step Down
   As President

   Derek Bok said he will step down as president of Harvard
University at the end of the next academic year, ending one
of the longest-running tenures at the helm of a major
university.
   Mr. Bok, 60 years old, became the latest in a string of
top Harvard managers to announce their resignation over the
last year or so, and left a major question as to who his
successor will be. One person formerly thought of as a
leading candidate for the post, A. Michael Spence, resigned
as dean of Harvard's faculty of arts and sciences in March to
be dean of the business school at Stanford University,
perhaps Harvard's closest rival for eminence among U.S.
colleges.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bok, who has been president since 1971, said that at
the end of 20 years, he believed Harvard needed fresh energy
to see it through a major fund-raising drive for about $2
billion that is expected to start within the next few months.
He said he hasn't yet settled on his plans after next year,
although he is tenured on Harvard's law faculty and has been
offered a University Professorship that would give him
freedom to teach in other areas.
   "With the prospect of a major fund-raising campaign coming
up, I think it's best to get some new leadership that will
see us through that effort," said Mr. Bok. "I really didn't
think I wanted to spend another seven or eight years in this
position."
   Asked whether the fund-raising drive wouldn't be
handicapped by the loss of him and Mr. Spence, Mr. Bok said
he believed it was better for him to leave now than in the
midst of the campaign. Two of Harvard's top graduate schools,
government and law, also changed leadership in the last year,
creating an unusual number of new faces in management posts.
   Some outsiders, who had expected Mr. Bok to see through
the fund-raising drive, said the timing of the resignation
was unexpected.
   "It's really surprising. There's no real milestone that
would explain this now," said Leon Botstein, the president of
Bard College in Allandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. Mr. Botstein and
others credited Mr. Bok with steering Harvard successfully
through a difficult period, characterized by radical student
protest at its beginning and serious attacks by the federal
government in more recent years.
   Under Mr. Bok, Harvard revamped its curriculum for
undergraduates, creating a much-copied "core" of required
classes in the sciences and humanities that required about a
quarter of students' time. He also guided the development of
the Kennedy School of Government into a major graduate school
and created a new office to manage the university's
endowment, which grew to over $5 billion from $1 billion
during his tenure.
   In 1986, Mr. Bok debated William Bennett, then U.S.
secretary of education, who argued that Harvard and other
prestige schools were charging too much and weren't
adequately teaching the classic tenets of Western
civilization. Last year, the U.S. Justice Department began an
investigation of possible tuition and financial-aid
price-fixing at Harvard and about 50 other private schools.
   Harvard said it will form a committee to search for Mr.
Bok's successor. Handicappers said a leading candidate could
be Henry Rosovsky, Mr. Spence's predecessor as dean of the
faculty of arts and sciences, who also has been acting in
that capacity since Mr. Spence left.
   Under Mr. Bok, Mr. Rosovsky helped design the core
curriculum and was well-liked by senior faculty for upholding
Harvard's tough tenure policies, which have been criticized
as being too restrictive to junior faculty and hard to
overcome by minorities and women.

   Macy's Suppliers
   Face Tighter Policy
   By Insurance Firm

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- In yet another indication of anxiety about the
creditworthiness of R.H. Macy &amp; Co., an insurance company
decided to tighten its policy for clients doing business with
the giant retailer.
   Charles Marks, American Credit Indemnity Co.'s corporate
secretary, said the firm is limiting its exposure to Macy.
American Credit, based in Baltimore, insures accounts
receivables. Manufacturers typically buy such insurance to
minimize their risk should their customers become insolvent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We've reviewed the account and are establishing new
guidelines as to our credit criteria for insurance," said Mr.
Marks. "We aren't, however, cutting Macy off." He declined to
disclose the financial limits the company has set for Macy or
its current exposure to Macy.
   "What this means is that we may impose different
conditions relative to the terms under which new merchandise
can be shipped to Macy," added Mr. Marks. He said American
Credit decided to review Macy because it is concerned over
Macy's continued losses. For the third quarter ended April
28, Macy reported a net loss of $63.1 million against a $64.1
million loss a year earlier.
   "We're not saying anything is wrong with Macy's, but we
are concerned about the losses," said Mr. Marks.
   A Macy spokesman declined to comment. However, he stated
that Macy doesn't anticipate any problems with receiving new
merchandise.
   Yesterday Macy met with several major factoring companies
to ease their fears that Macy was having unexpected financial
setbacks. Last week, several factoring companies, which buy
accounts receivables from manufacturers, said they were
tightening standards on future shipments of new merchandise
to Macy.
   Separately, prices of Macy's high-yield, high-risk junk
bonds weakened slightly yesterday. The retailer's 14 1/2%
subordinated debentures due 2001 were quoted at 59 cents on
the dollar, down about one cent from Friday's prices.
   "From a strictly financial perspective, we've seen a lot
worse," said Richard Reubenstone, a junk-bond analyst at
Delaware Bay Co. He estimates that Macy's cash flow will fall
about $25 million short of the amount needed for interest
payments, debt repayment and capital spending in the fiscal
year ending July 31.
   For fiscal 1991, Mr. Reubenstone expects that gap to widen
to about $140 million. Still, Mr. Reubenstone says, the
retailer appears to have adequate bank borrowing lines to
cover its cash needs the next two years.
   "So far, we are providing full support for Macy's," said
Hajime Yoshitake, a banker at Japan's Kyowa Bank, which
helped finance the Macy buy-out.
   A Macy spokesman strongly disagreed with Mr. Reubenstone,
saying the company doesn't anticipate any cash-flow shortfall
in meeting either short or long-term obligations.

   NEW YORK -- John Sculley, chief executive officer of Apple
Computer Inc., sold about $5 million of the company's stock
earlier this month -- apparently continuing a pattern of
option-related sales.
   The 120,000 shares, which represented nearly a third of
his Apple holdings, were acquired through the exercise of
options in October at $7.75 each, according to Securities and
Exchange Commission filings. The stock was trading at about
$41.75 a share on the days Mr. Sculley sold, indicating a $4
million profit on the transaction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker said
Mr. Sculley sold for "personal financial reasons" and
declined to elaborate. Mr. Sculley wasn't available.
   The price of Apple stock has fallen since Mr. Sculley's
sales; it was trading at about $41 a share on the national
over-the-counter market yesterday. Apple was one of several
technology stocks that tumbled Friday after Adobe Systems
Inc. announced that earnings for the quarter ending Friday
would be below analysts' expectations. Apple, whose laser
printers use Adobe software, is Adobe's largest customer.
   Mr. Sculley, who earned about $2.3 million last year,
retains about 265,000 Apple shares, according to SEC filings.
He acquired a total of 374,994 shares when he exercised
options in October.
   Last spring, Mr. Sculley sold 100,000 shares acquired
through the exercise of options for just under $4 million. An
Apple spokeswoman characterized the sale as part of "a
pattern." The executive sold 50,000 shares in 1988 and a
block of more than 100,000 shares in 1986.
   "I don't think there's a signal in the sales," said
Charles R. Wolf, an analyst who follows Apple for First
Boston Corp. He noted that it isn't unusual for Apple
executives to sell stock acquired through the exercise of
options. He added, however, that the year beginning Oct. 1
will be "a make-or-break" year for Apple because of the
scheduled introduction next year of new entry-level Macintosh
computers.

   BULLISH ON PRIMERICA: "If I weren't bullish on Primerica,
I wouldn't have joined the company," said Jeffrey B. Lane,
president of Primerica Corp.'s Primerica Holdings Inc. unit.
   Mr. Lane, who joined the financial company in February,
bought 10,000 shares of the financial-service company's stock
earlier this month, increasing his holdings to 15,000 shares.
Primerica is the parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Mr. Lane resigned from Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings
Inc. in December after being demoted from the president's
post by the investment bank's then-chairman, Peter A. Cohen.
Mr. Cohen resigned from Shearson, a subsidiary of American
Express Co., in a management shakeup in January.
   The chairman of Primerica, Sanford I. Weill, is a former
chairman and chief executive of Shearson. "I made a lot of
money with Sandy at Shearson, and I have the same high
expectations here," Mr. Lane said.
   He already has made money, on paper at least. According to
SEC filings, he bought the Primerica shares for $29.76 each.
The stock closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at $33 a share.

   DRUG SALES: Executives at Schering Plough Corp., a
pharmaceutical and consumer-product company, are among the
big sellers listed on the table accompanying this story (see
accompanying illustration -- WSJ May 30, 1990). The biggest
sale was by Richard J. Kogan, president, who according to SEC
filings sold nearly $400,000 of stock, about 29% of his
holdings.
   John V. Guigon, vice president and general counsel of the
Madison, N.J., company, sold his entire holding for just over
$200,000, the filings show. Robert G. Weiss, vice president
and controller, sold shares acquired through the exercise of
options for a total of $261,855, according to the filings;
the shares accounted for 94% of his holdings.
   A Schering spokesman said the officers sold "to meet
personal financial obligations" and "top management continues
to have substantial holdings" of company stock.
   The company previously reported a 20% jump in
first-quarter earnings, announced a dividend increase, and
said it expects earnings for the year to be up 18% to 20%
from 1989. "The company is doing very well," said Ronald
Nordmann, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. The sales were
"collectively small. . . . I don't see anything here that
gives me any concern for the future."
   The stock price has risen a since the Schering executives
sold. Mr. Weiss sold his shares May 1 at $82.50 each.
   Mr. Kogan reported his May 9 sale to reflect the effect of
a 2-for-1 stock split payable today to stock of record May 4.
He sold 9,280 post-split shares at $42.50 each (4,640 shares
at $85 each on pre-split basis). Mr. Guigon also reported his
May 8 sale on a post-split basis; he sold 4,736 shares at
$42.375 each (2,368 pre-split shares at $84.75 each).
   Schering-Plough closed yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at $91 each, pre-split.

   MORE TREES FOR BRAZIL?

   Brazilian scientists drew up a $20 billion plan to help
combat global warming by planting about 10 billion trees.
They calculate the trees would absorb 5% of the atmosphere's
carbon dioxide -- the central villain in the "greenhouse
effect."
   The project, which has the backing of Brazil's
pulp-and-paper industry, was conceived by scholars at Sao
Paulo University's Institute of Advanced Studies.
   Prof. Aziz Ab'Saber, one of the project's architects, said
the plan is intended to provide raw material for Brazil's
paper-and-pulp industry, fight global warming and improve the
local environment.
   Brazil is seeking international funding. But with the
country already heavily indebted to foreign lenders, it may
be difficult to raise more funds.
                                                                                                       

   TURNING SCRAP TO GOLD
                                                                                                       

   Scientists emigrating from the Soviet Union to Israel are
living an alchemist's dream: turning scrap metal into gold,
silver and platinum. Officials of Satec, a firm set up in
1987, say a ton of worn-out printed circuit boards can be
turned into 10 to 28 ounces of pure gold in hours, at about
half the price of other processes. Soviet immigrant Herman
Branover set up Satec after a Brooklyn rabbi urged more jobs
for Soviet scientists in Israel. Satec will funnel expected
profit to jobs and homes for other immigrants.
                                                                                                       

   EC-JAPAN TACKLE TRADE
                                                                                                       

   The European Community Commission and Japan will set up a
"working group" aimed at reducing trade barriers between two
of the world's largest trading partners. The accord, reached
during the first ministerial-level meeting between Japan and
the EC Commission in 3 1/2 years, is mainly aimed at finding
ways to reduce the EC's persistent $20 billion trade deficit
with Japan. The two sides also agreed to expand a program to
promote EC exports to Japan.

   Ibusz Rt., the Hungarian state-owned travel company, set
its share price at 4,900 Hungarian forints ($75.79) a share
in its planned flotation of 40% of its stock on the Budapest
and Vienna stock exchanges next month. Ibusz will be the
first major privatization of an East bloc company on a
Western stock exchange. Ibusz will sell to private investors
440,000 shares, half of which are targeted for foreigners. An
additional 40,000 shares will be offered to employees in a
private placement. Ibusz posted 1989 pretax profit of 1.1
billion forints.

   The U.S. edition of a private Soviet business weekly
debuts this week. The paper, Commersant, began publication in
Russian and English in January. It has a Soviet circulation
of 350,000, and the Soviet-American edition is expected to
attract up to 60,000 subscribers at an introductory $165 a
year. Created by Vladimir Yakovlev, Commersant covers topics
such as joint ventures, the unofficial dollar exchange rate
and Soviet government decisions affecting business. It
advises readers on starting a business, where it is risky to
invest, how to attract foreign capital and how to invest
rubles.
                                                                                                       

   CANON'S OFFSHORE MOVE
                                                                                                       

   Canon Inc. is considering shifting all the company's
compact-camera production from Japan to China, Taiwan, and
Malaysia by 1992, because of a serious labor shortage in
Japan, a spokesman confirmed. Production of compact cameras
in the three Asian countries is expected to surpass four
million units a year by 1992. Canon, Japan's leading maker of
cameras and office automation equipment, currently
manufactures three million compact cameras a year in Japan
and Taiwan.
                                                                                                       

   CHINESE RULERS' FALL PREDICTED
                                                                                                       

   Former U.S. presidential adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski
predicted the fall of China's Communist government.
   At a private seminar in Tokyo, Mr. Brzezinski, who was
national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, said:
"The existing Chinese regime is on its last legs, and it
probably will not endure beyond two to four years."
   Mr. Brzezinski, noting that Communism has proven to be
"historically a grand failure," said the irreversible
collapse of the Communist systems in Eastern Europe "poses
the growing likelihood that the temporarily frozen political
system of China will before too long erupt into renewed
turbulence."
   But Mr. Brzezinski said China shouldn't be isolated. "With
the waning of the Cold War, we will have to facilitate the
entry of China into a more cooperative global community," he
said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A Vancouver, Canada, school-board committee approved
installing condom-dispensing machines in bathrooms at the
city's 18 high schools to help students protect themselves
from AIDS. . . . An ancient murrelet is drawing hundreds of
birdwatchers to the Bristol Channel in southwest England. The
small diving bird "has never been recorded outside the
northern Pacific Ocean before; its appearance in Britain is
likely to be the bird sighting of 1990," said Richard
Millington, who runs a rare-bird information service.

   Farley May Have to Fight Bondholders
   Over Control of West Point-Pepperell

   CHICAGO -- William Farley, still pinched by a shortage of
cash in his $1.56 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell
Inc., may soon have to battle his bondholders over voting
control of the company.
   Ironically, his most potent weapon in such a fight may be
an outside evaluation suggesting he overpaid for the 1989
acquisition -- making it less advantageous for his creditors
to force him into bankruptcy. West Point-Pepperell is a West
Point, Ga.-based textile company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., financial adviser to some of Mr.
Farley's bondholders, suggested to its clients last week that
they seek voting control, one person close to the situation
said. Officials at Kidder declined to comment, except to say
that "no consensus" on strategy has yet been reached among
bondholders. Officials at Farley Inc. declined comment.
Farley Inc. is Mr. Farley's closely held manufacturing
concern, and the overall umbrella company for his business
empire.
   Further, Kidder has surprised some bondholders by
estimating West Point-Pepperell's breakup value in the range
of only $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, or up to $500 million
less than its total debt load, sources said. The low
valuation may eliminate one of the bondholders' possible
tactics: forcing Mr. Farley into bankrupcty and liquidating
West Point-Pepperell to recover their investment.
   Troubles worsened for Mr. Farley and his creditors in
March when West Point Acquisition Corp., the unit he set up
to buy West Point-Pepperell fell into default on $796 million
in bank debt and missed bondholder interest payments.
   Last month, Mr. Farley offered to surrender majority
ownership of West Point-Pepperell, which he fought so hard to
win in a takeover battle last year. But Mr. Farley's offer
would leave him in control of West Point through his
ownership of a series of so-called super-voting privilege
common shares, sources said.
   In April, according to people on Wall Street, Mr. Farley
offered certain debt holders a combined stake of 65% in a
restructured version of West Point-Pepperell. The transfer of
the equity stake would help reduce and delay certain interest
payments, sources said.
   Though a major setback for Mr. Farley's once-burgeoning
industrial and investment empire, the exchange offer to
bondholders nevertheless may be the only strategy to keep him
out of bankruptcy-law proceedings. But if Kidder's low
valuation of West Point-Pepperell is accurate, Mr. Farley may
avoid a bankruptcy-law filing for now because he apparently
overpaid for his takeover target.
   Mr. Farley has completed his tender offer on 95% of West
Point-Pepperell, but he is about $83 million short of the
cash needed to complete the transaction for 100% control.
Sources close to the transaction said his bankers, led by
Wells Fargo &amp; Co., San Francisco, and Bankers Trust Co., are
likely to loan him the cash needed to close the deal if
holders of West Point Acquisition bonds agree to the
debt-for-equity exchange. Bankers Trust is a unit of New
York-based Bankers Trust New York Corp.
   Kidder's recommendations to bondholders are generally
conciliatory, sources said. They added that bondholders'
negotiations with Mr. Farley over restructuring ownership of
West Point-Pepperell may take several months.
   Mr. Farley's financial strength ebbed earlier this year
with the collapse of his investment banker, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. His Farley Inc. had a pretax loss of about $40
million in 1989, analysts estimate.

   Cadbury Schweppes to Pay $211 Million
   For Most of Perrier's Soft-Drink Business

   Cadbury Schweppes PLC of Britain agreed to buy most of the
soft-drink business of Source Perrier S.A. for #125 million
($211 million). Paris-based Perrier had put the business on
the block long before contamination forced a world-wide
recall of its trademark bubbly water in February.
   Cadbury, a major candy and beverage concern, acquired
almost all of Perrier's non-cola soft drinks for what
analysts say was a slightly higher-than-expected price.
Although Perrier Chairman Gustave Leven said last year that
he sought at least 1.7 billion francs ($300 million), Paris
analysts said they hadn't expected the business to fetch more
than one billion francs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I think that they {Perrier} got a pretty good price,"
said Alain Kerfourn of the brokerage house Sellier S.A., a
Paris unit of Britain's National Westminster Bank. He said
the sale would help Perrier cover the cost of its bubbly
water recall and relaunch, but he added that the benzene
contamination probably didn't affect either the decision to
sell or the price received.
   The deal, which is conditional on clearance by French
authorities, is in line with the strategy of both companies.
Perrier has been selling many of its smaller subsidiaries in
recent years, concentrating in areas of strength such as
water and Roquefort cheese. Cadbury, meanwhile, has been
expanding aggressively, with the recent purchase of Procter &amp;
Gamble Co.'s Crush International and of soft drinks in
Portugal and Spain.
   Chris Milburn, a Cadbury spokesman, said the deal "gives
us a critical mass in the French soft-drinks market,"
increasing the company's market share there to 16% from just
over 6%. He added that soft-drink consumption in France is
low by U.S. and European standards, "so there is room for us
to develop it."
   The acquisition, being made through the purchase of shares
in a Perrier subsidiary, Cie. d'Exploitation de Boissons
Rafraichissantes, includes noncarbonated drink brands called
Oasis, Bali and Atoll, as well as the French bottling rights
to Gini, a lemon-flavored brand Cadbury acquired as part of
the P&amp;G deal. These brands accounted for sales of #91.3
million in 1989, contributing #18 million to Perrier's
soft-drink division. The deal doesn't include Perrier's
license to bottle Pepsi, which is the subject of a legal
tangle between Perrier and PepsiCo Inc.
   Cadbury shares were up 13 pence to 347 pence ($5.87) in
late trading in London yesterday.

   MOSCOW -- As Mikhail Gorbachev headed for a warm welcome
at the summit meeting in Washington, he suffered a stunning
defeat at home with the election of populist Boris Yeltsin as
president of the Russian Federation parliament.
   The victory enables Mr. Gorbachev's outspoken rival to
establish an opposing center of power in the Soviet Union's
largest republic. A longstanding critic of Mr. Gorbachev's
moderate efforts at economic overhaul, Mr. Yeltsin can use
his new platform to whip up public sentiment for his own
demands for more radical and speedy change.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After his victory, Mr. Yeltsin got a standing ovation from
the federation parliament, and his election led the evening
television news, while Mr. Gorbachev's arrival in the West
was buried 25 minutes into the broadcast.
   Still, it was hardly a sweeping victory -- three rounds of
voting were held in the parliament before Mr. Yeltsin scraped
by with a margin of only four votes. And in his new role, Mr.
Yeltsin will have to restrain his bombastic manner and seek
compromise in the fiercely divided 1,060-seat legislature.
   Indeed, political analysts say it was a promise by Mr.
Yeltsin to build a coalition in the parliament that finally
swayed some conservative hard-liners to his side. Under such
constraints, the 59-year-old Mr. Yeltsin could be an engine
forcing Mr. Gorbachev into riskier reforms.
   "Maybe in this combination, Gorbachev will have more
chances to be decisive and radical," said Rair Simonyan, a
senior economist at the Institute of World Economy. "He needs
a person who can call a spade a spade."
   Mr. Yeltsin immediately extended a conciliatory hand to
Mr. Gorbachev. "I'll build our relationship on a
business-like basis, on the basis of dialogue and
negotiation, not confrontation," he told Interfax news agency
after his victory.
   Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev used to be allies in the
early days of Mr. Gorbachev's leadership. Handpicked as first
secretary of the Moscow Communist Party in 1985, the brusk
former builder bullied officials for corruption and purged
dozens of top city officials. Mr. Yeltsin helped Mr.
Gorbachev by proposing the most radical reforms, leaving Mr.
Gorbachev the middle road.
   But by 1987, he had become too great a risk for Mr.
Gorbachev and was ousted from the party job. Last spring, in
a remarkable comeback, Mr. Yeltsin won a place in the Soviet
national parliament with 89% of the vote in his constituency.
Lately, as Mr. Gorbachev faces rising fury over the lack of
goods in stores and demands for independence by some
republics, Mr. Yeltsin has been accused of stirring up
discontent for his own gain.
   Mr. Yeltsin stood for election in a brand-new parliament
whose members, including himself, were elected only recently
in the first free election for the Russian Federation. Mr.
Yeltsin leads the Democratic Bloc, an alliance of liberal,
pro-reform members, but more than half the members of the
parliament are conservative members of the party.
   Mr. Gorbachev campaigned hard against Mr. Yeltsin, at one
point telling the Russian parliament that Mr. Yeltsin was
leading the Soviet Union away from socialism. Two rounds of
votes were held in which Communist Party-backed candidates,
the Russian Federation's standing Prime Minister Alexander
Vlasov and then hard-liner Ivan Poloskov, failed to gain a
majority, as did Mr. Yeltsin.
   Mr. Yeltsin's final victory is largely credited to his
last-minute pledge to build a coalition. Some analysts say
Mr. Gorbachev approved the Yeltsin option only late Monday on
the guarantee that a conservative would be deputy chairman.
   As president of the Russian Federation, Mr. Yeltsin now
leads the biggest Soviet republic, stretching 5,000 miles
from Kaliningrad on the Baltic to the Far East, and home to
about half the nation's population. A major theme of his
campaign was greater political and economic autonomy for his
republic within the Soviet Union. He isn't known as a
dedicated supporter of secession movements in the Baltic
republics, but his increased power could strengthen the
nationalist movements that threaten to fracture the nation.
   More immediately, his opposition to Mr. Gorbachev's
halting economic reforms could undermine the leadership's
program. The presentation last week in parliament of the
program included three stages of price reform, starting with
price rises for bread from July 1. The program is still under
debate by parliament, but the presentation immediately
sparked a new rash of hoarding. Reports of panic-buying were
hard to confirm, but during the weekend, lines seemed longer
than usual.
   On Monday, rationing was imposed in Moscow to stem the
hoarding; shoppers must present internal passports. The
controls seem to have brought a slight improvement. Still,
many Soviets fear rationing will be permanent even though the
government says it is temporary.

   NEW YORK -- Investors, emboldened by higher bond prices,
drove stocks sharply higher, but trading was lackluster in
both markets.
   The industrial average jumped 49.57 points to close at
2870.49, a new record, and more than erasing Friday's
34.63-point slump on even thinner trading. Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index also closed at a new record -- 360.65, up
6.07 -- for the first time since last October.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose more than a half
point, or $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. The dollar was
mixed.
   A major factor in the Friday stock-market plunge was a
scare of big earnings disappointments lurking in technology
stocks. But yesterday the profit goblins vanished and shares
of International Business Machines led the advance.
   Late Thursday, software maker Adobe Systems said it would
earn less than expected because of slower orders from such
customers as Apple and IBM. The announcement unleashed a run
on technology stocks Friday, including IBM. "The Adobe
Systems debacle on Friday provided traders an excuse to sell,
but was not a harbinger of any fundamental problem besetting
the industry," said A.C. Moore, research director at Argus
Research.
   Adding to stock investors' zeal for IBM and other
technology issues yesterday was a positive story about the
computer giant in Barron's magazine. "IBM has reasserted
itself as the bell cow of the market," much as it was in the
early 1980s, said Mr. Moore. "IBM would have rebounded
without the Barron's article," but perhaps not as much as its
3 1/2-point gain to 119 3/4.
   While volume was limp, the breadth of the advance
encouraged analysts. On the New York Stock Exchange,
advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 1,107 to 434.
   "Any time you get advancers of over 1,000, it indicates
it's not just program activity," said Kenneth Spence,
director of the technical analysis group at Salomon Brothers.
In addition, he noted that the volume of shares rising in
price swamped trading in declining stocks by 5 to 1. He said
that ratio suggests strong buying by institutional investors,
not just computer-assisted program trades in baskets of
blue-chip stocks.
   Peter Canelo, chief strategist at Bear Stearns, says he
isn't surprised by the stock market's buoyancy. He thinks
price-earnings ratios are in line, suggesting the stock
market isn't overvalued. "The competitive allure of bonds is
not overwhelming," he asserted.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose sharply in light trading, with 137.4
million shares changing hands on the Big Board.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.62%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6740 marks and 151.25 yen, compared
with 1.6824 West German marks and 149.40 Japanese yen Friday.

   When Sandra Kurtzig quit as president and chief executive
officer of ASK Computer Systems Inc. five years ago, she
vowed never to return to the company she co-founded in 1972,
saying she wanted more time for her children and herself.
   But last September, the entrepreneur returned to run ASK,
a Mountain View, Calif., producer of management information
systems for manufacturing companies. Her goal: to bring back
the entrepreneurial spirit to a company that lost it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Many aging entrepreneurial companies are trying to
restore the energy and vitality that brought them their
initial success," says William Sahlman, an associate
professor of finance at Harvard Business School. Especially
after professional managers have succeeded founding
entrepreneurs, companies often start "looking for someone
else to stir up the pot," he says.
   Ms. Kurtzig's unusual experience of running a company for
a second time shows one approach to the difficult problem of
reviving the entrepreneurial spirit. So far, the 42-year-old
executive has redesigned products, got rid of laggard
managers, recruited new directors with entrepreneurial
backgrounds, and subtly changed the atmosphere. Employees
even say the food and beer at the "Friday bash" have
improved.
   Even though ASK had sales of $186.3 million for the year
ended last June 30, "Its business had grown stale," says
Peter West, ASK vice president, business development. True,
earnings in fiscal 1989 climbed to $13.5 million, or $1 a
share, from $10.8 million, or 82 cents a share, a year
earlier. But directors anticipated a decline, and sure
enough, in the nine months ended March 31, profit dropped 73%
to $2.4 million, or 18 cents a share, from $8.7 million, or
65 cents a share, a year earlier.
   While earnings had climbed in recent years, ASK had
concentrated too much on creating products for the
minicomputer and failed to develop products for the emerging
workstation market, analysts say. And although the company
had been exploring new products and new markets, "its
toe-in-the-water approach would hurt it somewhere down the
road," says Charles E. Taylor Jr., an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Since returning to ASK, Ms. Kurtzig has discovered that
reviving the entrepreneurial climate in an 18-year old
company can be a formidable task. The company that she and
her husband, Ari, started in a second bedroom now has 55
offices world-wide and nearly 1,000 employees. But ASK, which
once dominated the market for information systems for
manufacturers, has relinquished a large share to a number of
aggressive newcomers.
   "Sandy's advantage is that she knows the business and
helped put it in place," says Paul Ely, a venture capitalist
who joined ASK's board this year. "Founders are the best flag
carriers."
   In 1972, Ms. Kurtzig quit as a marketing specialist with a
General Electric Co. unit, and she and her husband launched
ASK -- named for the first initials in their names, Ari and
Sandra Kurtzig. At first, the company developed software for
assorted business applications, but in 1978, it came up with
a program that ran on a Hewlett-Packard Co. minicomputer and
could help small manufacturing companies run an entire plant.
The program was an instant hit, and ASK's profit and sales
soared. ASK went public in 1981. Two years later, Ms.
Kurtzig's personal stake in ASK was valued at $67 million.
   By 1985, Ms. Kurtzig was divorced from her husband and
raising two sons, then aged 12 and 9. When she resigned as
ASK chief executive, the company recruited top management
with a big-business background.
   "I felt guilty about all the attention I got, became tired
of being the news," Ms. Kurtzig says. The divorce, a
shareholder lawsuit concerning shares she sold at a secondary
stock offering, and the constant focus on her as the first
woman to head a major high-technology concern took their
toll. "It all became very wearisome," she says.
   After Ms. Kurtzig left, ASK continued to post earnings
gains. But "it lost its entrepreneurial edge and market
leadership," says Mr. Taylor, the Prudential-Bache analyst.
Unlike Ms. Kurtzig, who constantly met with fellow employees
and workers, and was closely involved with ASK's operations,
the new managers were distant and unapproachable, says Mr.
West, the business development vice president.
   Moreover, investment in new products declined to near
zero. During Ms. Kurtzig's earlier tenure, the company had
been plowing back almost half of its research and development
funds into new product development; later, practically all
the R&amp;D money was used to enhance existing products.
   By the middle of last year, ASK's board was determined to
bring Ms. Kurtzig back. In the four years after she left ASK,
Ms. Kurtzig wrote her autobiography, traveled extensively and
invested in a few Silicon Valley companies. But "you could
see she was frustrated at not having found the right company
to run," a close friend says. When the board asked her to
come back as chief executive, she readily agreed.
   Among her first steps was to bring on entrepreneurially
minded people to the board. To increase employee
participation in ASK, Ms. Kurtzig asked research and
development employees to rate the performance of the
division's managers. The top-rated managers were rewarded
with greater responsibility, she says. Most of those who
received low ratings are "not with the company any more," she
says.
   She also put an end to the practice of senior managers
giving themselves hefty raises and bonuses. "I don't like the
idea of one group giving itself bonuses over others who also
deserve it," she says. "It creates divisiveness. It prevents
team-playing." Focusing on team spirit and communication, Ms.
Kurtzig tries to attend many company meetings to observe and
follow what is happening.
   When problems loom, Ms. Kurtzig has been quick to
intervene personally. When customers of a product line that
was recently acquired by ASK complained that they felt
"insecure and unsure of ASK's commitment" to them, Ms.
Kurtzig met with the user group to outline plans for the
product and reassure users.
   She also is working on ASK's next generation of products,
making them simpler to use and compatible with different
types of computers and data bases, says Nicholas Coutros, a
manufacturing technology analyst with Ferris, Baker Watts,
Inc., a Baltimore brokerage firm. ASK also is increasing its
efforts to sell its products for a variety of computer
systems, including those made by International Business
Machines Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. And the company,
which sold its products directly to users, now is exploring
other sales channels as well. To position itself in a new
global manufacturing market, ASK is establishing offices in
Europe and Asia.
   Mr. Coutros says he doesn't expect all these changes to
pay off on the bottom line for a year or so. But Ms. Kurtzig
says ASK has more opportunities now than it did when she
founded the company. An established base of customers and
almost $30 million in cash give ASK a "head start on its
competitors," she says.

   WASHINGTON -- Chairman Lloyd Bentsen of the Senate Finance
Committee has proposed requiring countries to use some of the
economic aid they receive from the U.S. to buy U.S. goods.
   Along with Sen. David Boren, (D., Okla.), the Texas
Democrat has drafted a bill that would tie U.S. foreign
assistance to increased purchases of U.S. goods. The bill
comes at a time the Bush administration is trying to persuade
countries including Japan, West Germany, Britain, Canada and
France to eliminate such "tied aid."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bill's outlook is unclear, but Congress currently is
under pressure to change the way it dispenses foreign aid and
to find ways to increase U.S. exports. It would take effect
in the fiscal year beginning October 1991.
   "It's time to move more aggressively," the finance
chairman said.

   This Camp No Doubt Had to Pay
   A Premium for Liability Coverage

   You've heard of weight camp, music camp, drama camp,
tennis camp and even computer camp. Now, there's a yuppie
parent's dream: law camp.
   At National LawCamp, opening this summer in Miami Shores,
Fla., teen campers will be introduced to the basics of the
bar, from how to file a lawsuit to how to try a case. With
proper coaching, they may be able to decide once and for all
whether law is the right profession for them -- and perhaps
even choose their legal specialty, a distinct advantage for
any high school sophomore or junior.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The three-week July session will offer daylong seminars on
such substantive subjects as the Fourth and Fifth amendments
and the law of torts. There will be field trips to a nearby
courthouse, hikes to a crime lab and, for starry nights
around the campfire, lectures on legal ethics.
   Visiting lecturers will include criminal defense lawyers
and state and federal judges. Staffers from Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center Ltd., the test-review company, will hand
out treats: samples of the Law School Admissions Test.
   The idea, says camp founder Chris Salamone, a Fort
Lauderdale lawyer, is to give young people "an idea at an
early age about whether they really are interested" in the
law. He hopes also to counter what he calls the glamorization
of law through television. "It's not all fast cars and
prizes," he says.
   Mr. Salamone, whose father runs sports camps nationwide,
hopes to teach the young campers how to think like lawyers.
"In law school, there are no answers, only questions,
arguments and analysis," he says. "We want to start them
thinking in this new way."
   So far, 27 teens have signed up, for $1,995 each. Their
parents -- and perhaps the campers themselves -- have been
attracted by such pitches as this from the most recent issue
of Washingtonian magazine: "While other kids are practicing
tennis this summer, yours can be practicing law."
   Kelly Warrick, a high school junior from Stamford, Conn.,
says she spent her camp days last summer at Amherst College,
taking a course called "Comparative Satire in British and
American Literature."
   This summer, she'll switch to law camp because, she says,
she's "interested in the challenge of proving things. Also,
I'm trying to explore my options careerwise now."

   Ruling Will Decide if Clinics
   Receiving Federal Funds
   May Provide Counseling

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether
federal officials may prohibit federally funded family
planning clinics from counseling women about abortion or
providing referral information.
   The justices will review a November ruling by a federal
appeals court in New York that upheld the abortion counseling
prohibition adopted in 1988 by the Reagan administration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The case, which will be argued in the fall and probably
decided next spring, provides the justices with a vehicle for
further restricting abortion rights, a direction favored by a
majority of the court. But Rachael Pine, an American Civil
Liberties Union attorney for those challenging the
regulations, said, "it is pretty much unimaginable" that the
court would use the case to overrule the right to abortion.
   Prior to 1988, federal regulations that were adopted to
implement Title X of the Public Health Services Act allowed
federally funded clinics to provide abortion counseling and
referral information, although the clinics were barred from
performing abortions.
   But the Reagan administration issued regulations that
require family planning centers to refrain from providing
abortion counseling or giving referrals; to maintain
completely separate records, facilities and personnel if
centers operate abortion clinics; and to abstain from
lobbying or filing lawsuits to protect the right to abortion.
   The Title X program costs about $200 million annually and
funds more than 4,000 centers that provide family planning
and other reproductive health care to an estimated five
million low-income women.
   The new regulations were challenged in a number of courts
by a variety of medical groups, individual doctors and local
Planned Parenthood chapters, which operate family planning
centers and, in some instances, also run separate abortion
clinics that aren't federally funded.
   Due to federal court injunctions, the regulations haven't
been fully implemented, although they may have taken effect
in a few places, according to Ms. Pine.
   In the case the high court agreed to hear, Planned
Parenthood of New York City Inc., Medical and Health Research
Association of New York City, and the state of New York all
challenged the regulations. They argued that the regulations
were inconsistent with federal law, infringed on the
constitutional right to abortion, and violated the First
Amendment free-speech rights of doctors to counsel their
patients. The appeals court rejected all of the arguments but
stayed enforcement of the regulations while the case was
being appealed.
   A federal appeals court in Boston ruled in March that the
same regulations are unconstitutional. That ruling made it
almost certain the high court would hear the New York appeal,
the first to arrive at the court, to resolve the conflicting
appeals court views.
   The Bush administration urged the high court to hear the
New York case and said that it will defend the regulations.

   TOKYO -- Japan's leading indicator of its economy moved
well above the so-called boom-or-bust line in March, the
latest reporting month, to 68.2 from a revised 41.7 in
February, an official at the Economic Planning Agency said.
   Another agency official said that, barring a sudden change
in external factors, Japan's economy should remain in an
expanding trend. The agency considers a reading above 50 a
sign of economic expansion in the future and a reading below
50 an indication of possible contraction ahead.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of the leading indicator's 13 parts, those that turned
positive in March, contributing to the index's favorable
move, included construction starts, private-sector housing
starts, and the commodities index.
   The coincident indicator, which reflects the current state
of the economy, stood at 60 in March, rising from a revised
50 in February. Of the 11 parts in this index, notable
changes included the inventory ratio to production, which
swung to the plus side in March, after lingering at negative
levels since last autumn; positive turns in industrial
production and capacity utilization; and improvement in sales
by medium-sized businesses.
   The lagging indicator, which measures the economy's recent
performance, remained unchanged at 85.7.

   Rule of Law:
   Lawrence Walsh, Drug Cases and
   The Costs of Selective Prosecution

<LP>
   "Nothing is too trivial for these people to investigate,"
said the official giving the Justice Department's view of
independent counsels. "The proof of that lies in what we
already know about their expenditures." When Assistant
Attorney General John Bolton made these comments in 1987,
Lawrence Walsh's office was less than a year old and had
spent $1.3 million.
   Mr. Walsh's office now reports that it's spent more than
$20 million. Despite expectations that he'd take down his
shingle after the John Poindexter trial, Mr. Walsh this month
called a new grand jury. He may prosecute more officials for
what he calls a "pattern of deceit."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Walsh's office begins to look like a permanent agency,
but a government office with a difference. Freedom from
accountability for independent counsels seems to extend to
making it impossible to find out how much they've really
spent. I know. I've tried.
   Mr. Walsh's reported expenses of $20.8 million do not
include costs that his prosecutions forced onto other
government offices. On request, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's staff disclosed nearly $8 million more, shown in
the table "Iran-Contra Costs," for a total of $28.7 million.
The FBI has spent more than $5.4 million helping Mr. Walsh,
with security adding nearly another $1 million. Although the
Justice figures include $29,000 to track the Walsh budget,
officials admit these figures are seriously incomplete.
   The White House, Defense, State, CIA, National Security
Council and National Security Agency all have huge unreported
expenses. So do the courts. In 1987 alone, the White House
had to hire 60 lawyers and archivists to review classified
material. The Washington newspaper Legal Times more than a
year ago estimated that the total cost of the Iran-Contra
cases then was $40 million, possibly $100 million. This
sounds about right.
   Let's put even the low-ball $28.7 million into
perspective. This dwarfs the $3.8 million allegedly diverted
from the Iranian arms sales to the Contras. Or the $13,800
"illegal gratuity" in the form of the home security fence for
Oliver North.
   And for what? We haven't learned much from the Iran-Contra
prosecutions that wasn't disclosed by the presidential Tower
Commission and the congressional hearings. Mr. Walsh never
tried to prove that the diversion itself was illegal or that
the Boland amendments applied to the National Security
Council. Judges so far have decided the crimes warranted
nothing more than community service.
   Two Contra fund raisers copped tax pleas based on what a
Justice official called a "wacko legal theory." Robert
McFarlane, Mr. North and Mr. Poindexter, respectively,
withheld information from Congress, aided and abetted in
obstructing Congress and obstructed Congress. Middlemen
Albert Hakim and Richard Secord pleaded to covering up Mr.
North's security fence. Mr. Walsh had to drop the case
against former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez, but still pursues
former CIA official Thomas Clines on tax charges.
   No one has looked into any "pattern of deceit" by
Congress, but how do offenses by executive-branch officials
fit into law enforcement more generally? Contrast
Iran-Contra's $28.7 million with the $50 million budget for
the office of New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
More than 400 prosecutors last year filed criminal cases in
Manhattan against more than 120,000 defendants, including
more than 11,000 alleged felons -- $400 per defandant.
   Maybe it's more fair to compare the Walsh prosecution with
other federal prosecutors. In pursuing nine former
executive-branch officials and their private contractors, Mr.
Walsh has spent more than any of the 93 U.S. Attorneys'
Offices spent in 1989 (except for Washington, D.C., where the
federal prosecutor has many local functions). The table "Cost
Per Criminal Defendant" shows the performance of selected
U.S. Attorneys. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan
prosecuted more than 1,400 cases -- including complex Wall
Street cases -- with a budget smaller than Mr. Walsh's.
   According to a statistical report by the Justice
Department, the top two crimes targeted by U.S. Attorneys
were drugs and crimes committed with weapons. No one would
say these prosecutions had anything to do with criminalizing
the battle over separation of powers.
   Such extraordinary prosecutorial resources devoted to a
few defendants raise clear civil liberties issues. "How
frightening it must be," Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his
dissent to the case upholding these prosecutors as
constitutional, "to have your own independent counsel and
staff appointed with nothing else to do but to investigate
you." The average lawyer in a U.S. Attorney's Office handles
117 cases a year, picking them with a discretion that
independent counsels need not exercise.
   Congress created prosecutors who would show no restraint
with executive-branch targets, but this game has gone too
far. With drugs and violent crime tearing at the social
fabric, this is no time to fund political prosecutions.

   Regional Groups
   Move to Regulate
   Recycling Labels

   Two regional government groups took another collaborative
step toward regulating marketers' claims that consumer
products and packaging are recyclable, recycled, reusable or
waste-reducing.
   The Coalition of Northeastern Governors and the Northeast
Recycling Council, which represent 10 states and various
industry interests, proposed model definitions and rules on
the use of recycling labels. The final regulations, likely to
be adopted in some form throughout the Northeast, are
expected to influence similar efforts in other states.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The state officials and industry representatives reached
broad agreement on the need for uniform labeling standards to
promote recycling and waste reduction while protecting
consumers from false or misleading environmental claims.
However, proposed definitions of what is "recyclable" and
what is "recycled" have prompted disputes between industry
officials who say they are too strict and environmentalists
who say they aren't tough enough.
   "There is no consensus right now," says Shelley Dresser,
executive director of the recycling council. The council and
the coalition are sponsoring a "labeling summit" meeting next
month to resolve disputes and refine regulatory proposals
that later this year will be submitted to the states for
adoption.
   Under current proposals, a product or packaging could wear
a "recyclable" label if it is recycled in a given state at a
20% rate this year, 35% by 1995 and 50% by 2000. To be called
"recycled," most products would have to contain 50% secondary
material, including 15% to 40% consumer waste. Plastic
packaging would have to contain 35% secondary material,
including 15% consumer waste. Secondary material also
includes manufacturing waste.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. says the proposals could actually
discourage recycling because many products that are being
recycled won't qualify for labels. Tom Rattray, a P&amp;G
packaging executive, says the 35% recycled content
requirement for plastic packaging is too high because there
isn't enough plastic waste being collected.
   However, Environmental Action Foundation, a Washington,
D.C., advocacy group, is pushing for a 50% recycling rate and
higher consumer-waste content to force industry to invest in
recycling. "We want the label to be hard to get so that
manufacturers have an incentive," says Jeanne Wirka,
foundation policy analyst.
   There is also disagreement among the states. New York, for
example, is proposing a 25% recycling standard, while Rhode
Island would grant the label to any material covered by its
mandatory recycling law. The groups are seeking to avoid
state-by-state inconsistencies that would impede recycling.

   Airlines Scramble for California Fliers

   The California coast has become the front line in the war
among the nation's airline superpowers.
   On Friday, Delta Air Lines will become the fourth carrier
to offer shuttle service between the state's two largest
airports, San Francisco International and Los Angeles
International. The launch follows United Airlines' expansion
of shuttle service to half-hourly departures, and with two
other leading carriers, American Airlines and USAir, the
route will have 168 flights a day. Some think that rise in
capacity will finally force widespread fare discounting on
intrastate travel in the nation's most populous state, a
market that accounts for one of every 20 domestic passengers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Delta fired the first shot with a $198 promotional
round-trip fare, quickly matched by rivals, down from the
posted $372. "It sounds to me like it's going to be a big
bloody battle," says Continental Airlines' top marketing vice
president, John Nelson, who says the Texas Air unit is
"absolutely delighted not to be in the market."
   But the major California combatants are intent on avoiding
fare wars, stressing service and spruced-up gate areas
instead. "We've made it abundantly clear that these fare cuts
are temporary" and give way to the $372 fare again on July
31, says Whitley Hawkins, Delta's senior vice president,
marketing.
   United, too, expects to be able to avoid long-term fare
wars, and American expects only "continuing downward pressure
on fares through the summer." The $198 unrestricted fare,
paid by business travelers and others who can't book much in
advance, is still 37% above the $145 fare available to Los
Angeles-San Francisco fliers who can book in advance.
   Because of the promotional fares, a round of fare cuts
that swept the country last week largely skipped California.
   For years, United battled fare-cutting regional rivals
such as Pacific Southwest Airlines and AirCal while other
giant national airlines steered clear of the California
market. "Carriers were terrified of the fare environment,"
says John C. Pope, United's executive vice president and
chief financial officer.
   But the regionals were snapped up in the mid-1980s
following airline-industry deregulation, taking a lot of the
pricing pressure off the remaining players. When United
doubled its Los Angeles-San Francisco schedule, for instance,
it didn't cut fares at all. (It and others do pass out
frequent-flier benefits, however, which airlines consider
tantamount to price cutting.)
   Mr. Pope believes the industry has "rationalized" the fare
structure, which for travelers means the disappearance of
once-plentiful under-$100 round trip tickets. United says it
would like to dominate the "Bay-to-Basin" corridor --
including Oakland and San Jose to the north and Burbank,
Ontario, Long Beach and Orange County to the south -- that is
the nation's busiest metropolitan pairing.
   But some Californians fume over the fare-hiking ways of
the invading nationals that swallowed up Pacific Southwest
Airlines, AirCal, Western Airlines and others.
   "I get a lot of disbelief when I quote fares," says Susan
Lundell of Lande Travel, who has learned to use a few
"oddball carriers" offering lower intrastate fares: $63 on
TWA's one Los Angeles-San Francisco flight, or $29 for a
Southwest Airlines 21-day-advance Burbank-Oakland ticket.
(Southwest's $59 Burbank-Oakland full fare on the route,
matched by rivals who previously had charged $186, is the
rare case in California in which a low-fare carrier claimed
enough airport space to start its own shuttle.)
   Instead of cutting fares, airlines are peppering local
media markets with ads claiming superior California service.
And they are preparing long-term strategies for waging the
war of attrition they see developing out West.
   The ads for Delta, based in Atlanta, picture cattle
boarding a presumed rival shuttle with the caption: "Have You
Herd the Moos?" The ads promise a touch of Southern
hospitality. Free wine also will be served on flights.
   A bigger challenge, though, is simply to build name
recognition in California. By buying struggling Western
Airlines in 1986, Delta overnight won a big Los Angeles
presence, but one that lacked a cohesive strategy. The
shuttle, and Los Angeles-New York nonstop service also
starting Friday, help fit California into Delta's national
and international plans. To convince locals it's here to
stay, it has used supermarket ticket promotions and become
the official Dodgers and Disneyland airline.
   American, a unit of AMR Corp. of Dallas, has focused on
service, too, expanding food and drink service to all
flights, rather than just morning ones, and keeping open the
extra Los Angeles check-in counter it normally shuts after
the busy Easter holiday. It also made major scheduling
sacrifices to keep up. After cutting back its hourly Los
Angeles-San Francisco schedule, for example, it recently
restored it, and now aims for departures every 45 minutes.
   American reversed itself because it didn't "want to send
the wrong signal" as rivals increase service, says Joseph
D'Ambrosio, vice president of the airline's Western division.
"We know that California and the Pacific Northwest is the
gateway to the Pacific, and that's our future." He adds that
"we're not losing money but we're not making any" because so
many airlines split the market.
   A year ago, American and others did slash intra-California
fares. But fares generally have climbed since then. Mr.
D'Ambrosio predicts an eventual industry "pulldown" as
carriers flying so many flights discover that "it's not going
to be a profitable market for most carriers."
   UAL Corp. of Chicago is adding planes to United's
California fleet to help it dominate the market vacated by
PSA, AirCal and Western. The service will be profitable,
United believes, because its calculations show the recent
rise in Los Angeles-San Francisco capacity does little more
than return the total number of flights in the market to
levels prevailing several years ago, and because shuttles
bring in more full-fare business. "The beauty about a
shuttle, and about half-hour service," Mr. Pope says, "is
that there's a lot less concern on the part of the public to
ticket in advance, or to make sure you're there early."
   United is adding special baggage facilities and amenities
for business travelers, Mr. Pope says, but "the real seller
has got to be that you've got a plane leaving every half
hour." There is some question, however, about how well United
has promoted itself, especially in the face of Delta's catchy
new campaign.
   When USAir Group bought PSA in 1987, it hardly expected
the kind of competition it is now facing. And being caught by
surprise may be the reason that, by most estimates, USAir
isn't doing well there despite a heavy level of service.
   Acknowledging that "the competition has increased
significantly with Delta and American and United," Seth
Schofield, executive vice president of operations at USAir,
says a buildup is under way. USAir next month begins moving
450 flight attendants and 50 pilots to Los Angeles from North
Carolina.
   Another airline on Californians' minds is still only a
gleam in the eyes of some state legislators. At first airline
industry executives joked about Golden State Air, the
state-run airline being proposed by Sen. Art Torres (D., Los
Angeles), but the bill advanced. Now that proponents want to
finance startup with a one-cent-a-gallon airline fuel tax,
industry opposition is taking off.

   Investing in Patents to File Suits Is Curbed

   A federal judge ruled that it is illegal under New York
law to buy an interest in a patent solely to pursue
patent-infringement lawsuits.
   In the decision against Refac International Ltd. -- whose
main business is buying up broad patents and then suing other
companies for alleged infringements -- U.S. District Judge
Michael Mukasey said such arrangements amount to "nothing but
a hunting license."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The case involved a software patent that Refac claimed was
being infringed by six major software companies: Lotus
Development Corp., Ashton-Tate Inc., Borland International
Inc., Computer Associates International Inc., Microsoft Corp.
and Informix Software Inc. The suit, filed in 1989, is one of
the first patent-infringement cases involving computer
software.
   The judge said Refac's contract with the Canadian patent
holders, who sold Refac a 5% stake in the patent, violated
New York's so-called champerty statute. Champerty, which is
illegal in many, but not all, states, occurs when someone
helps pay the costs of someone else's lawsuit in exchange for
a share of any proceeds.
   Judge Mukasey, in federal court in Manhattan, N.Y., said
the real plaintiff in the case is Forward Reference Systems
Ltd., the Canadian firm that owns 95% of the patent. The
judge said the case will be dismissed unless Forward
Reference either joins or replaces Refac in the suit.
   "The primary purpose for the assignment here was to enable
Refac to commence actions as {Forward Reference's} surrogate
plaintiff," the judge ruled.
   Lawyers for the software companies praised the decision,
which also said their clients could seek to require Refac to
pay their legal costs.
   Henry B. Gutman, a lawyer for Lotus, said the decision
could have implications for other companies that have been
targeted by New York-based Refac for alleged patent
infringement. "If someone wants to bring a patent
infringement case, they have to bring a patent infringement
case. They can't bring in a hired gun like Refac," Mr. Gutman
said.
   Attorneys for Refac couldn't be reached for comment.
Forward Reference also couldn't be reached.
   The software involved was designed to improve the way
computer instructions are given when a spreadsheet is
processed. The patent was issued in 1983 to Remy Landau and
Rene Pardo, two Canadian inventors, who formed Forward
Reference.
   Frustrated in their efforts to get the software companies
to license the patent -- which the Refac lawsuit claims the
companies were already using -- the inventors turned to Refac
in 1989. In granting Refac the 5% stake, the company was
required to sue at least two alleged patent infringers within
one month.
   Judge Mukasey said, "The agreement acknowledges that
Refac's 5% interest is `to facilitate suit in Refac's name as
plaintiff and to avoid the need for having {Forward
Reference} named or brought into the suit as a co-plaintiff.'
It is clear that Refac is not the real party in interest."

   HOSPITALS WIN Medicare payment dispute with federal health
agency.
   A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that an
estimated 6,000 hospitals don't have to comply with a
Department of Health and Human Services regulation that, in
effect, required them to accept partial payment for Medicare
patients.
   The HHS rule required payments to hospitals be limited to
the amount specified by Medicare, even if the patient
received additional liability-award payments or was entitled
to them under a liability-insurance policy. The hospitals
sought the right to dip into such liability awards to help
cover actual costs. The hospitals estimated that Medicare
pays 23% to 50% less than their charge.
   Judge Royce Lambeth ruled last week that the federal
government couldn't interfere with hospitals' statutory right
to bill liability insurers or file liens against liability
awards to collect their full charges for treatment of
Medicare payments.
   "This ruling will allow hospitals to collect millions of
dollars that otherwise would have been lost," said Gregory M.
Luce, a partner at Fulbright &amp; Jaworski, the law firm that
represented the American Hospital Association, which brought
the suit.
   Health and Human Services attorney Darrel Ginstead said it
was the department's position that patients benefited from a
system that shielded their liability awards from the
hospitals' grasp. He said the department hasn't decided
whether to appeal the ruling.

   "WORKING POOR" are targeted by law firm for pro-bono
efforts.
   Hunton &amp; Williams of Richmond, Va., the Southeast's
largest law firm, is opening a neighborhood office to provide
legal services to residents who have jobs but can't afford
lawyers.
   The office, which will be headed by a full-time partner
and 11 part-time associates, will serve those who earn above
the threshold for federal poverty benefits, including
legal-aid services, but who make under twice that amount.
(The threshold is $8,600 for an individual and goes up
incrementally according to the number of dependents in the
family.)
   "It's intended to reach the working poor, people who have
jobs and a paycheck but don't have enough money in their
savings to pay for a lawyer," said George H. Hettrick, the
partner who conceived of the idea.
   Several large law firms have opened satellite offices in
poor neighborhoods and offer legal services for free. But
this is one of the first attempts to meet the needs of people
who, while poor, have enough income to disqualify them from
federally assisted legal aid.
   Clients will be asked to pay a flat $50 fee, plus such
routine costs as filing fees. Initially, the office will only
represent clients in housing and real-estate matters, such as
landlord-tenant disputes, uncontested domestic matters and
guardianship questions involving juveniles and the elderly,
said Lewis F. Powell III, a partner and chairman of the
firm's pro-bono committee.
   Hutton &amp; Williams ruled out taking on criminal-defense
cases because the firm doesn't specialize in criminal-defense
work, said Mr. Powell. Since Hunton &amp; Williams represents
many of Richmond's major employers, the firm will be
precluded from handling employment-discrimination cases, as
well.
   Mr. Hettrick, who specializes in corporate finance, will
staff the office. Eleven associates volunteered to donate 100
hours a year, said Mr. Powell. The office is expected to open
next month.

   Something about this Summit has the air of an antique.
American Presidents and Soviet leaders have been meeting like
this for three decades, and as with previous Summits this one
nominally has to do with an arms-control agreement. But
somehow the agreements that Secretary of State Baker has so
arduously prepared for this meeting between George Bush and
Mikhail Gorbachev seem to be at the periphery of the events
now driving the world.
   The Mikhail Gorbachev who arrives today in the U.S. may
have been the catalyst for many of these forces (he didn't
create the forces named Solidarity and Sakharov) but it can
hardly be said that he controls them. He is trying to control
them, and they are trying to control their own destinies. The
world's cameras may focus on another U.S.-Soviet Summit, but
the real game is elsewhere.

   Yeltsin
                                                                                                       

   Boris Yeltsin's election to the presidency of the Russian
Federation yesterday moved the Soviet Union another large
step toward political fragmentation. President Yeltsin wasted
no time in challenging the authority of President Gorbachev,
declaring that his victory marks the "blossoming of Russia as
a sovereign, independent government in the framework of the
union." He immediately tested that proposition, calling on
the Russian Federation parliament to reject the economic
reform announced by the central government last Thursday.
Again, Mr. Gorbachev had offered too little, too late.
   If Mr. Yeltsin is able to take Russia down an independent
path, Mr. Gorbachev's own recent elevation to the newly
created presidency of the Soviet Union would look rather
hollow. The Soviet President would find himself to be the
President of a "union" no longer united.
   The Baltic states will continue to press their bids for
independence. Georgia wants out, too. Armenia is engaged in
armed revolt. Resentments are smoldering in the Islamic
republics and could burst into flames at any moment. Ukraine
is restive and also has rejected the economic plan. Now the
presidency of Russia itself, with half of the population of
the entire union, has fallen to Mr. Gorbachev's most
important rival.
   The contest between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev has not
yet been decided, of course. President Gorbachev will attempt
to renew his party support at the important all-union party
congress scheduled for early July, but no one yet knows how
that will turn out.
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Economy
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Yeltsin's victory yesterday was directly attributable
to the half-baked government economic program presented to
the Soviet parliament. By announcing future price increases,
it touched off a consumer panic, further depleting already
barren store shelves. Because it was yet another ineffectual
step toward the "market economics" Mr. Gorbachev keeps
promising, it played directly into Mr. Yeltsin's claims that
his rival is a "lover of half measures and half steps."
   The Soviet Union may be facing both fragmentation and
economic collapse. It may in fact be necessary for both of
those two things to happen if the death grip of the Communist
Party and its associated bureaucracy is ever to be broken.
Already, local authorities are taking more and more economic
matters into their own hands, not just in the smaller
republics but within the Russian republic itself. Moscow's
new mayor, Gavriil Popov, seems serious about conducting the
city itself down an independent path. Russian cities and
regions talk much these days of withholding the fruits of
their local economies from Moscow.
   In other words, Mr. Gorbachev's main opposition is coming
from parties and factions that want a more liberal and
democratic Soviet Union, not from forces that threaten to
install a new tyranny. He was given his sweeping powers by a
Communist Party that is trying to do the impossible, retain
communism and at the same time bring about an economic
reform. Since that cannot be done, it is quite possible that
economic collapse is inevitable. And if it is, there may be
little the West can do to prevent it.
                                                                                                       

   Germany and Europe
                                                                                                       

   If as seems likely Presidents Bush and Gorbachev plan to
bargain over a reunified Germany's membership in NATO, they
are behind the power curve. Both reunification and NATO
membership are, for all practical purposes, a fait accompli.
   Germany effectively reunified on May 18 with the signing
of a German-German treaty that, by various estimates, moves
two-thirds to three-quarters of the way toward full
unification. Economic integration, one of the most
significant steps, will begin July 2. Germany already is
speaking with one voice, saying that it has no intention of
leaving NATO.
   More quietly, out of consideration for Soviet
sensibilities, it is saying as well that the Russians need
not expect much German economic cooperation so long as Soviet
troops remain on German soil. That point, made by the
strongest economic power in Europe, is not lost on a Soviet
leadership trying to head off an economic crisis.
   Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gorbachev are in a good position
to bargain over something the German people already have
decided. Indeed, peoples throughout central Europe are taking
a good many decisions out of the hands of the superpowers.
But this does not mean Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev have
nothing to talk about. The Soviet foot-dragging in the
conventional forces reduction talks in Vienna, plus the
suspension of their troop withdrawal from Germany, are worthy
of serious discussion. When Poland, after a long struggle,
broke its ties with the Soviet Communist Party, a certain
chain of events was inevitable. Today, the Warsaw Pact,
through which the Soviets legitimized their control over much
of central Europe, is a hollow shell. National governments
are taking command of Warsaw Pact armies, breaking the
command and control chain that previously led to the defense
council of the central committee of the Soviet Communist
Party.
   It should be noted that Soviet ineffectuality is only an
assumption. Armies are trained to fight. Soviet troops still
occupy key territories where they are not wanted. Soviet
missiles and warheads are just as destructive as ever. But
countries that were Soviet "satellites" a short while ago are
making their own decisions, not to mention the Soviet
republics themselves. The United States cannot protect Mr.
Gorbachev from these powerful forces. Mr. Bush should make
that clear this week. It can only support positive steps
toward peace, such as Germany's decision to stay in NATO, and
discourage negative ones, such as the delay in Soviet troop
withdrawals.
                                                                                                       

   The West's Response
                                                                                                       

   As counterpoint to the cacophony in the Soviet Union we
are beginning to hear a new version of an old song in the
West. It says, in effect, that the U.S. and Western Europe
shouldn't take undue advantage. Don't threaten to exclude the
Soviets from the new Europe. Don't excite the Soviet marshals
and generals into doing something rash. There is even talk of
a "Weimar Russia," a weak and ravaged state that would spawn
some new tyrant.
   There is as yet no evidence that the Soviet Union is in
any danger of being excluded from Europe. Europe extends to
the Urals and even a singular Russia, denuded of all its
empire, would remain the strongest military power in Europe.
With its tank armies, missiles and nuclear warheads, it looks
nothing at all like a forcibly disarmed Weimar Germany.
   That does not mean that the U.S. and the West need be
vindictive toward Mr. Gorbachev or the peoples who live under
Soviet rule. It is indeed important for the West to encourage
all the positive impulses it can discover in the new order
that surely must emerge from the wreckage of the Russian
empire.
   The U.S. and Europe can best defend the cause of peace by
continuing to uphold liberal, free-market democracy and by
retaining a military defense capable of dissuading even the
most radical Soviet general from trying to solve the
country's problems with a new military adventure.
   At Kennebunkport this past weekend, reporters pressed Mr.
Bush with questions along the newly emerging theme that the
West might try to take advantage of a weakening Soviet
leadership. We liked Mr. Bush's responses. He admitted that
Mr. Gorbachev has "enormous problems," but said it was not
the business of the U.S. to try to sort out those problems.
"It is our business to make clear to him what we can do and
those things we can't do."
   Throughout the post-war period, the Soviet Union has acted
apart from history, a state that contributed nothing to
mankind other than fear of its presence. Often in recent
years, the West's favored means of response to this status
quo was to periodically sign an agreement over arms that bore
little relation to political events on the ground. Now that
is changing, and if the meeting over the next several days
between President Bush and Mr. Gorbachev seems a bit beside
the point, it is because the Soviet leadership has at last
climbed down from the Summit and rejoined a world of real
politics and real economies. The fall of the Summit's
importance is itself a symptom of progress.

   A Special Summary and Forecast
   Of Federal and State Tax
   Developments

   THE MIDWEST IS TO TEST electronic filing of balance-due
returns next year.
   People who owe tax will get fewer benefits from filing
computer-ready returns by wire than did the 4.2 million
electronic filers whose 1990 refunds arrived faster. But they
will get receipts for their returns and help reduce errors.
The IRS is eager for the processing advantages. So it plans
in 1991 to have its Cincinnati center accept balance-due
returns from preparers filing electronically from West
Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the test works, the program will be made national in
1992. The returns can be filed early; preparers will supply
taxpayers with payment vouchers to mail with their checks by
April 15. Thus, payment won't be paperless; but the IRS is
experimenting with that. Its Andover, Mass., center this year
accepted six returns reporting taxes paid by wire transfers
from a bank. The bank advanced the funds for six customers
and billed their credit-card accounts.
   The IRS isn't allowed to take credit-card payments. Banks
may lend money for taxes in any form they choose.
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYERS' ERRORS in wage reports to Social Security
muddle many accounts.
   Social Security runs on records: It credited over $2
trillion in 1988 earnings to 130 million workers -- relying
on 265 million wage and self-employment-pay reports. But each
year, it faces over a million discrepancies between reports
to it and to the IRS. Three million more reports are shunted
to a "suspense file" while the agency tries to clear up
missing or faulty employer and employee ID numbers and to
correct other errors, so many workers lose credits for the
Social Security taxes they pay.
   Social Security Commissioner King says the agency is
taking many steps to instruct employers on filing correctly
and workers on checking their accounts. The IRS is starting
to assess penalties on employers who file withholding-tax
reports late, improperly, or not at all. And new rules
require employers to certify that they are reporting the same
information to both agencies.
                                                                                                       

   PAPERLESS PAYMENTS of state business taxes by wire are
spreading widely.
   Fourteen states require businesses to make certain large
payments by electronic transfers between banks; the number
adopting the more efficient and accurate systems may double
by 1991, officials say. Indiana collects $3 billion a year
this way from concerns owing at least $20,000 a month in
corporate-income, sales, payroll-withholding, and fuel taxes.
New Mexico gets over $80 million a month from 503 concerns
remitting sales, withholding, and oil-and-gas taxes.
   Electronic transfers help states manage cash flow and
raise interest-earning bank balances. But multistate
corporations worry about coping with a different system in
each state. So uniform standards are being developed and
promoted jointly by the Federation of Tax Administrators, a
state officials' group; the Committee on State Taxation, a
corporate group, and the National Automated Clearing House
Association. Most states are adopting these standards.
   In New England, the IRS is about to start testing
electronic collections of corporate federal tax deposits.
                                                                                                       

   INTENSIFIED AUDITS of small pension plans have pension
designers and their clients fuming. But the Supreme Court has
refused to review a seventh-circuit appeals-court ruling on
which the IRS relies. In that case, the IRS discredited
assumptions used in the tax-deductible funding of a plan for
Jerome Mirza &amp; Associates Ltd.
                                                                                                       

   A FOURGONE CONCLUSION? In a fourth straight case, the Tax
Court imposed damages of $5,000 on Orian E. Wright of
California for filing frivolous tax-protester pleas. He
appealed the three prior rulings to the ninth-circuit appeals
court; it has upheld two and recently ordered Wright to pay
$1,500 for a frivolous appeal.
                                                                                                       

   SALES TAXES are climbing again. Oklahoma's rose to 4.5%
from 4% on May 1. On July 1, Kentucky's goes to 6% from 5%
and New Mexico's to 5% from 4.75%. Nebraska's rises to 5%
from 4% on July 10. North Dakota voters will decide June 12
whether to raise their tax to 6% from 5% for a year.
                                                                                                       

   THEY WORKED IN deductible business losses when they laid
plans to work out.
   Bill Upton, Wayne E. Schirmer, and other professional men
of Moberly, Mo., formed an S corporation in 1982 to own a
health club for them. S concerns are taxed much like
partnerships; the founders noted that the 25 stockholders not
only would get free family memberships for their $8,000
investments, but also could deduct personal shares of the
club's losses. They sold some other memberships, mainly by
word of mouth; but the losses ranged from $13,954 to $21,352
in the club's first five years.
   The IRS denied the holders' 1982 deductions, saying the
club didn't have a profit motive. Now Tax Court Judge Shields
has upheld the IRS; the tax and recreational benefits show
the club wasn't run for profit, he says. The owners had no
expertise in running a club, didn't get expert advice, and
didn't hire a staff. They did "virtually nothing" to recruit
paying members.
   Indeed, the judge notes, the club didn't even put up a
sign to show the public what was available inside.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: The IRS plans a hearing June 11 on proposed tax
rules for employee-expense reimbursements. . . . Kenneth
Ralph Barger of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, may not deduct a loss
from mortgage foreclosure on a house he bought for his son,
the Tax Court says; Barger's motive in buying the house was
to help his son, not to make a profit.

   Chase Lowers
   Its Sights
   To Near-Rich

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Tired of listening to your broker? Try your
banker.
   In a bid to capture another slice of the securities
industry's customer base, Chase Manhattan Corp. is embarking
on a plan to open a nationwide system of "investment service
centers" where well-off -- but not truly wealthy --
individuals can go for investment advice. The first of 10
planned offices opened recently in Dallas, with others
scheduled for this year in upscale locales such as Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., Beverly Hills, Calif., and San Francisco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The idea is to attract to the somewhat more spartan
offices of Chase Investment Services individuals who would be
persona non grata in the plush environs of so-called private
banks at Chase and other banking institutions. The basic
entry fee is a net worth of $100,000, excluding a house. This
is considerably less than that needed to open the door at
Chase's private banking department -- $250,000 in annual
income, or $1 million in net worth, or $500,000 in investable
assets.
   Some banks already offer discount brokerage services for
investors who make their own investment decisions, and many
will manage your money, if it is sufficiently large, through
their trust departments. What Chase will offer at its centers
is investment advice.
   "There are very large numbers of people out there who are
making a good salary and all of a sudden have a couple of
hundred thousand dollars, but nobody to tell them who they
should have managing it or why," says Leonard Spalding, the
head of Chase's investment services division. He is a former
executive vice president at Kemper Financial Services who
joined Chase earlier this year.
   While Chase won't manage those individuals' funds, it will
tell them who should. Mr. Spalding has an agreement with RCB
International Inc. in Stamford, Conn., which evaluates and
selects money managers for pension funds, to provide the same
kind of advice for Chase clients.
   Using RCB's ratings, Chase will steer a new client to the
mutual fund or money manager that best suits the client's
investmest philosophy. With Chase backing them, investors
will have access to some top-flight money managers who might
not otherwise deign to take on such paltry sums. Once
invested, clients will receive quarterly statements from
Chase not only summarizing their account balances, but also
giving the money manager's views on what is happening in the
stock market and the economy.
   "The bulk of clients we'll have are serious about their
money, and they're not into `get rich quick' schemes," Mr.
Spalding says. "They're looking for a lot of advice. They
want to know who is managing their money and how. If a money
manager doesn't want to provide us with that information,
then we wouldn't use him."
   Chase will charge about the same fees for putting clients
into mutual funds as brokers would. For individuals who want
a money manager, the fee is 2% to 2.5% of assets under
management. Chase also will sell Treasury and municipal bonds
in the investment centers. Unlike private banks, Chase
Investment Services won't make loans.
   Performance? Don't expect top-of-the-heap returns. "We're
looking for performance, obviously, to be adequate and
probably superior to others offering similar products," Mr.
Spalding says. "But they don't have to be the best, because
in many cases, the best returns are achieved with a lot more
risk than most people would be willing to accept if they
understood what was happening."

   Mark IV Industries Inc. said its Dayco subsidiary reached
a five-year agreement with the United Rubber Workers to end a
24-day strike at its Waynesville, N.C., plant.
   Mark IV said it expects first-quarter earnings to be
reduced by about $650,000, or four cents per fully diluted
share, from the strike. But the quarter's earnings should
"compare favorably" to last year, said Sal H. Alfiero, Mark
IV chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year-ago quarter, the Amherst, N.Y.-based maker of
industrial products earned net income of $6.1 million, or 58
cents a share. On a fully diluted basis, the year-ago net was
50 cents a share. The year-ago figures include a gain of
$700,000 on the sale of securities.
   No terms of the labor pact were disclosed, but company
officials called it a "non-inflationary" pact that would make
the Waynesville facility more competitive.

   The supervisory board chairman of Co op AG, Hans
Friderichs, resigned from his post early yesterday in an
apparent dispute with the majority owners of the troubled
West German retailing group.
   In a news release, Co op also said it will continue its
cooperation talks with Rewe-Zentral AG, another West German
food retailer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company didn't give any reasons for Mr. Friderich's
resignation, which will take effect tomorrow. Two other
supervisory board members, Walter Birkhan and Wolfgang
Freiherr von Poelnitz, are also resigning.
   According to industry sources, Mr. Friderichs was opposed
to the sale of parts or all of the company to another company
by two banks that hold about 90% of Co op's shares.
   Mr. Friderichs, who negotiated the massive bank bailout
that rescued Co op from bankruptcy last autumn, was aiming to
keep the group independent and return it to profit through
its own means, the sources say.

   `Aida' Extravaganza
   Is Over -- Abruptly

   Canadian Production Using
   Live Animals Is Canceled;
   Hitachi's Expensive Flop

   Elephants and opera singers won't be performing "Aida"
this weekend at New Jersey's Giant's Stadium or in July at
Candlestick Park in San Francisco. The abrupt cancellation is
embarrassing to the opera's Canadian producers, but Japanese
electronics giant Hitachi Ltd. is also singing the blues.
   This Canadian production of an Italian opera set in Egypt
was supposed to be part of Hitachi's program to enhance its
image in the U.S. "by associating us with culture," says
Harry McGrath, deputy general manager for corporate
administration at Hitachi America Ltd. The U.S. subsidiary
started a cultural sponsorship program several years ago, but
the more than $1 million it spent to sponsor the U.S. tour of
"Aida" was its biggest expenditure ever, and the first for a
non-Japanese project. Previously Hitachi's cultural
promotions had been spent on importing Japanese culture, such
as kabuki theater, to the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is a grave disappointment to us," said Mr. McGrath
of the last-minute cancellation. "We've been working on this
for eight months, and it was to be our big event for the
year."
   The "Aida" opera spectacular, with 850 extras, a
46-foot-tall Sphinx and a menagerie of exotic animals, had
already been produced in six cities around the world by
International Opera Festival, a Montreal group founded for
this purpose. A spokesman for the festival blamed the
cancellation on the abrupt pull-out late last week of BCL
Group, which was contracted to produce and promote the opera
in the U.S.
   Tony Attanasio, marketing director for the International
Opera Festival, said that BCL issued a press release last
Thursday saying "they were disassociating themselves from our
company." Mr. Attanasio added, "They wouldn't tell us why."
   Gordon Currie, executive vice president of BCL
Entertainment Group, Toronto, which mostly produces
international tours of rock bands, declined to comment.
   Mr. Attanasio says about 27,000 tickets had been sold in
Giant's Stadium and a last-minute rush was expected to result
in two packed performances this weekend. But, he said, the
festival couldn't find someone else to run all the technical
aspects of the production just eight days before opening
night. He said the festival has already spent about $2
million for pre-production and promotion costs on the U.S.
tour.
   For its part, Hitachi plans to try to get back most of its
$1 million expenditure on "Aida," and it may be more careful
in the future about what it chooses to sponsor. But Hitachi's
Mr. McGrath said he doesn't think consumers will blame
Hitachi for the cancellation, adding: "If the Rolling Stones
were to cancel their tour, I don't think people would stop
drinking Budweiser."

   Focused Psychotherapy
   Shrinks Medical Bills

   CONSIDER the diabetic telephone lineman who really wanted
to be a journalist and piled up huge medical bills as a
result.
   A plot-line for the TV show "Twin Peaks"? No, it's an
example that Biodyne Institute, South San Francisco, Calif.,
uses to support its position that short-term mental health
treatment can shrink long-term health costs.
   In a four-year study, the research firm found that annual
medical costs fell about 35% among patients who had a few
sessions of "focused" psychotherapy. For those who had
traditional psychotherapy or no mental health care, changes
in medical costs ranged from slight declines to 25%
increases. Targeted treatment proved most cost-effective
among diabetics and other chronically ill patients, who
consume a disproportionate share of healthcare resources. The
study of 44,663 Medicaid patients and U.S. employees in
Hawaii was funded by the U.S. Health Care Finance
Administration.
   Focused therapy treats specific complaints over a period
limited to several weeks, says Nicholas Cummings, a
psychologist who's chairman and president of Biodyne.
Traditional psychotherapy regards such complaints as symptoms
of broader problems; treatment is usually open-ended and
lately a target of health-care cost-cutters.
   As for the lineman, he became depressed, couldn't climb
telephone poles and refused to maintain regular insulin
treatments. Every two weeks, he ended up in an emergency room
in a diabetic coma. His medical bills soared.
   Diagnosis: He hated his job. Eight weeks of therapy failed
to cure him of journalistic yearnings, but it helped him
accept a compromise -- a job as a proofreader in a publishing
company. He resumed consistent insulin injections, his
depression went away and his medical bills plunged, Mr.
Cummings says.
   Biodyne is not-for-profit, but Mr. Cummings is also chief
executive officer of American Biodyne Inc., which provides
mental health services based on the Hawaii study in several
states. The company projects that revenue will more than
double to $27 million in the year ending Sept. 30.
                                                                                                       

   High-Tech Diagnostics
   Aren't the Only Culprit
                                                                                                       

   MAGNETIC resonance aging and coronary angiography are
among the high-tech tests that take much of the blame for
unnecessary costs in medical diagnosis. But some low-tech
tests waste money, too.
   When hospital patients develop diarrhea, doctors commonly
order stool tests to look for bacteria such as salmonella
that might cause food poisoning or similar digestive
distress. But for patients already hospitalized at least
three days, these tests almost never find the cause of the
problem.
   University of Pennsylvania Hospital researchers found that
in a study of 3,387 samples checked for bacteria or
parasites, all 76 positive tests were from outpatients or
from those tested within three days of admission. Yet nearly
half the samples were from patients first tested after their
third day in the hospital.
   "Such practices misuse hospital and laboratory resources
at a time when cost containment must be considered a
priority," say the researchers in a recent issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association. Hospital labs
did about four million such tests in 1988. Eliminating 30% to
50% of them would save $20 million to $30 million in annual
hospital expenses, the researchers say.
                                                                                                       

   Mass Cholesterol Tests
   Work on Wall Street
                                                                                                       

   WORKPLACE cholesterol screening programs -- already
popular -- get a new boost from a report that shows they
work.
   A program among 886 workers at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. not
only succeeded in lowering cholesterol levels, but also
appeared to reduce overall heart-disease risk for many
participants.
   In initial 15-minute sessions, nurses measured cholesterol
levels with fingerstick tests and recorded blood pressure,
height and weight while awaiting the results. They also gave
participants pep talks on ways to change unhealthy habits.
   The tests showed that 411 employees, or 47%, had high or
borderline-high cholesterol. About 275 returned for a
six-month followup. Their cholesterol levels fell an average
of 8.3%, according to the report in the May issue of Archives
of Internal Medicine. There were other benefits. "If you do a
little counseling with the screening, people will make
significant changes in diet, weight, exercise and smoking,"
says Donald H. Gemson, a professor at Columbia University's
School of Public Health in New York.
   Dr. Gemson and the other researchers didn't do a cost
analysis of the program, but large-scale screenings, run by
nurses rather than physicians, are much less expensive than
individual blood tests sent to labs for analysis and
interpreted by doctors, he says.
   Another plus: "It's very popular with employees," Dr.
Gemson says. "They don't have to go to private doctors and
spend money out-of-pocket."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   SEVEN of 10 employees believe their employers should
provide health benefits for their families, but nine of 10
employers say they plan to reduce or eliminate coverage.
These findings in surveys conducted for Northwestern National
Life Insurance Co., Minneapolis, point to growing conflict
over benefits, the insurer says. . . . Uninsured women spend
an average of 1.9 days in the hospital for routine
childbirth, while those with traditional insurance spend 2.3
days, says Healthcare Knowledge Systems, Ann Arbor, Mich.

   Xerox Faces Fresh Round of Write-Offs

   NEW YORK -- If you thought the bad news at Xerox was over,
think again.
   Analysts and insurance-industry executives say Xerox faces
new write-offs at its Crum &amp; Forster insurance unit that
ultimately could rival the $400 million charge that Xerox
took in the first quarter to reflect deepening problems at
VMS Realty Partners, a partnership promoter in which Xerox
owns a 25% stake.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Leading the list of potential troubles this time is Crum &amp;
Forster's bread-and-butter property-casualty insurance
business, whose results have been hurt by cyclical
price-cutting. Xerox has said its operating profit this year
will be less than last year's because of weakness at Crum &amp;
Forster. But at least one analyst believes the troubles are
deeper than the company's mild statement would indicate.
   "We suspect Xerox will need to strengthen reserves before
the year is out, probably to the tune of $150 million to $200
million," says B. Alex Henderson, a Prudential-Bache
Securities analyst. Reserves, which are funds set aside to
make future claims payments, are deducted from earnings, and
a boost of that size would cost Xerox about $1 to $1.50 a
share after taxes.
   Mr. Henderson isn't the only observer worried about Crum &amp;
Forster's reserves. Moody's Investors Service cited concerns
about Crum &amp; Forster's reserves and its "below-average
profitability prospects" in lowering the
insurance-financial-strength rating on Crum &amp; Forster to
single-A-2 from double-A-3 two weeks ago.
   In response to these concerns, a Xerox spokesman says, "We
believe our reserves are adequate at this time."
   However, that's what insurance companies always say, right
up until they boost reserves, as Crum &amp; Forster did in last
year's third quarter to the tune of $140 million.
   Another problem that could cost Crum &amp; Forster an
additional $100 million or more in write-offs is transactions
with other insurance companies known as reinsurers.
Reinsurance is insurance coverage that insurance companies
buy to reduce their risk of having to pay big claims. But if
the reinsurer runs into financial trouble and can't pay its
bills, the reinsurance becomes "unrecoverable," a euphemism
for worthless. The company that bought the reinsurance then
must pay the claims that it intended to pass along to the
reinsurer.
   Crum &amp; Forster buys a lot of reinsurance, particularly for
high-risk types of insurance such as legal and medical
malpractice. "We suspect Xerox has some exposure to some
European reinsurers that appear to be struggling," says
Prudential-Bache's Mr. Henderson. "It is possible some
reinsurance Xerox bought could become valueless."
   Some of it already may be valueless. Crum &amp; Forster was a
customer of several reinsurance companies owned by London
United Investments, a troubled British holding company whose
management was put under the control of two court-appointed
administrators last week, in a step similar to bankruptcy
reorganization proceedings in the U.S.
   A Xerox spokesman says Crum &amp; Forster was owed $147.1
million in reinsurance recoverable from various London United
subsidiaries and affiliates as of last Dec. 31. However, Mr.
Henderson and several insurance-industry executives believe
the amount that Xerox might ultimately have to write off as a
result of London United's troubles could increase as claims
continue to roll in from Crum &amp; Forster policies that were
reinsured with London United units.
   Xerox says it is waiting for an independent study of
London United to be completed before it takes any action.
"It's just too soon for us to speculate on what financial
impact this may have on Crum &amp; Forster," Stuart Ross,
chairman of Xerox Financial Services, says through a
spokesman.
   Whatever the final bill for London United's woes, it seems
unlikely that Crum &amp; Forster will be able to recover all of
the $147.1 million it already is owed. Therefore, it seems
likely that some of it will be written off.
   In the past, Xerox has been able to prevent reserve
increases or reinsurance write-offs from depressing net
income by taking capital gains from its investment portfolio.
Last year, for example, Crum &amp; Forster took $358.7 million of
capital gains, mostly from trading some of its $5.4 billion
bond portfolio.
   But this year, it will be much tougher for Xerox to take
such gains because the value of its bond portfolio has been
depressed by rising interest rates. At the end of the first
quarter, Xerox's portfolio had a paper loss of $282 million,
compared with a paper gain of $77 million at the end of last
year.
   The one bright spot at Xerox is the company's traditional
strength, its business-equipment sector. But even there lurks
an obvious but unquantifiable problem: Brazil.
   The new Brazilian government's Draconian austerity plan,
which is intended to bring long-term economic stability to
the country, may in the short term depress Xerox's earnings.
   Mr. Henderson of Prudential-Bache estimates that Brazilian
operations contributed 35 cents a share last year to Xerox's
earnings of $6.25 a share.
   Though Brazil's austerity measures began in March, they
weren't reflected at all in Xerox's first-quarter earnings
because Xerox closes the quarterly books on its foreign
operations a month early. The first hint of the Brazilian
problems will come in Xerox's second-quarter earnings, which
will include results of foreign operations for March, April
and May.
   Xerox declines to estimate the earnings impact of the
Brazilian measures, which include a price freeze. A Xerox
spokesman offers this assessment: "If prices remain frozen,
all we can say is we'll have a difficult year. Brazil is
likely to be a significant source of quarter-to-quarter
uncertainty through the balance of this year."
   Perhaps reflecting that uncertainty, analysts' estimates
of Xerox's operating earnings, excluding any special
write-offs, vary widely. Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch is
at the low end, forecasting earnings of $4 to $4.50 a share
this year and $4.50 to $5 a share next year. At the high end
is Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds, who is expecting
$5.80 this year and $6.70 next year. Mr. Henderson of
Prudential-Bache is forecasting $5 a share this year and
$5.65 next year.

   NAGOYA, Japan -- Banking is a dying trade at Higashi Chita
Agricultural Cooperative Bank. Big-city interlopers are
trying to woo away the cooperative's newly affluent customers
with splashy services. But it has found a niche: funerals.
   The co-op helps customers and their families arrange
cremations and family altars, get floral wreaths and
distribute inheritances. Its slick banking rivals may beat
the co-op on lending and deposit rates, its officials reason,
but not on neighborly compassion. "If we can handle this
well," says Hisaki Matsuura, a planning manager, "we will be
able to establish eternal relationships" with the bereaved.
Last year, the co-op handled 234 funerals in the suburbs of
this smokestack city.

   In the land of financial giants, where the 10 biggest
domestic banks are also the world's 10 biggest, Higashi Chita
is a Lilliputian. But its offbeat moves to survive in a newly
hostile environment illustrate the turmoil in Japan's
once-coddled financial industry.
   Goaded by rapid liberalization of financial regulations,
Japan's banks are having to change the way they do business.
Big-city institutions are focusing increasingly on the
domestic market and seeking to set themselves apart from the
pack. Medium-size and regional banks are talking about
mergers. And small banks and specialized institutions are
fighting for their lives. Government officials even speculate
openly about the possibility of the first bank collapses
since World War II.
   In Hiroshima, locals joke that the battle among the banks
resembles gang warfare. Nearly every major commercial bank in
Japan is represented in the western coastal city, and so
fierce is the competition for customers that interest rates
paid on deposits are, surprisingly, higher than in Tokyo.
Hiroshima Bank, a big regional bank, recently escalated the
war by deciding to open on Sundays. Hiroshima City
Agricultural Cooperative tries a soft sell: Its telephone
operators answer calls in English with a cheerful "Howdy]"
   The sweeping change in Japanese banks has implications for
the way they do business overseas, too. Bankers and
government officials say the overhaul of Japan's domestic
banking industry in coming years will reduce the
international competitive power of its financial giants.
   With nearly $7 trillion in assets, Japanese deposit-taking
institutions already face some constraints on lending because
of tougher international rules requiring them to back up new
loans with fresh capital and because of the difficulty of
raising capital as the Japanese stock market plummeted in the
first quarter. And with the prospect of a huge restructuring
in domestic banking, Japanese banks will be less able to push
their foreign businesses.
   "The big banks will have to become more cautious about
international expansion," says Junichi Ishikawa, executive
managing director of Kyowa Bank Ltd.
   He should know: Starting in 1985, Kyowa trimmed its
foreign role and revamped its domestic operations to focus
exclusively on small and medium-sized borrowers in Japan.
Today, its staff has shrunk by one-quarter to 7,200 full-time
employees and its corporate-loan portfolio by $2 billion. So
far, its profits haven't soared far above those of other
banks, but credit analysts routinely cite Kyowa as the
smartest of Japan's big banks.
   The prospect of such important changes has attracted
advocates of even-faster reform. Worried by the relative ease
with which Japan's well-protected banks had been displacing
their U.S. and European rivals over the past decade,
Washington has been demanding with increasing force that
Japan accelerate its financial liberalization. Last week in
Tokyo, U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford warned
Ministry of Finance officials that unless Japan acts soon to
deregulate deposit rates further, the U.S. Congress is likely
to pass a proposal authorizing retaliation against Japanese
banks operating in the U.S.
   The repercussions could be serious. The biggest bloc of
foreign banks in the U.S. is Japanese; they own four of the
top 10 banks in California. Sensing the heat, Japan's major
business newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, editorialized
recently that "Japan's attitude . . . not only lacks in
consideration towards the international situation but lacks
from the domestic depositors' viewpoint as well."
   The U.S. pressure didn't sway the Japanese officials,
though. They say their government will complete the process
of deregulation as quickly as it can, and no sooner. After
six years of U.S. prodding, they note, Japan already has made
substantial strides toward complete deregulation. But any
interest-rate regulations are unfair, U.S. officials argue,
because the very low levels of interest that Japanese banks
pay depositors give the institutions a vast source of cheap
funding and enable them to lend that money at interest rates
well below those that U.S. and other international banks can
afford.
   The Japanese don't agree. "The reality is that the
weakness of U.S. banks is a problem made by their big
mistakes, not regulation here," a Finance Ministry official
says. "We are deregulating as a matter of fairness to small
depositors who deserve better rates, not for U.S. banks."
   Though officials in Washington may not have felt the
breeze of change, a financial tornado is already blasting
through Japan. Most significant is the effect of
interest-rate deregulation. The once-guaranteed profit
margins from government-set interest-rate spreads -- most
banks make money by lending at higher interest rates than
they pay depositors -- have given way to market-set, floating
rates and razor-thin rate spreads. Unregulated accounts now
constitute nearly 70% of the $1.2 trillion on deposit at
Japan's 12 big commercial banks. Even at agricultural co-ops,
the share of unregulated deposits has soared to nearly 30%
from none a year ago.
   So, profit margins are narrowing, and Japanese banks will
have to find ways to compete harder against one another. Some
of them are casting about for marriage partners. Recently,
two giants, Mitsui Bank Ltd. and Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., fused
together to form Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., the world's
second-largest bank with more than $400 billion in assets.
   Medium-sized Tokai Bank often hints that it would be a
merger candidate for a strong domestic bank, and even mighty
Mitsubishi Bank acknowledges that it would consider the right
suitor. Still others -- notably Bank of Tokyo, which has a
small domestic branch network and an expensive string of
international offices -- routinely have to deny speculation
that they might be takeover or merger candidates.
   While the winds of deregulation are rattling some Japanese
banks, at least one foreign bank, Citicorp, is lurking like a
vulture hoping to feast on the carnage. After long trying
unsuccessfully to buy its way into Japan's retail market, its
Citibank unit recently won Finance Ministry clearance to open
virtually as many branches as it wants. Masamoto Yashiro, who
was hired from Exxon Corp.'s Japanese subsidiary to head
Citibank's retail efforts, thinks that within a decade the
bank may have 50 to 70 retail branches, mostly in Tokyo, up
from eight now.
   "Deregulation will provide us with opportunities to grow
faster," Mr. Yashiro predicts. Citibank hopes to exploit its
cachet as the only foreign bank in Tokyo's retail market and
win business from Japanese with experience or business
interests overseas. "We want to be selective," Mr. Yashiro
says, aiming for only relatively well-off Japanese. "We want
to segment the population, we want to segment products, we
want to segment services."
   That sort of specialization is one tactic that other banks
inevitably will follow as the government eliminates current
legal distinctions among them. Japanese banks have long been
protected not only from market interest rates but from banks
in other business areas: Commercial banks handled corporate
and retail loans; regional banks handled smaller companies;
trust banks were independent, and long-term credit banks
doled out term loans. Until the early 1980s, Bank of Tokyo
even had a near-monopoly on foreign-exchange and overseas
transactions.
   However, the barriers between different types of banks are
crashing down, and many smaller financial institutions, such
as Higashi Chita Agricultural Cooperative Bank, are facing
direct competition from bigger, broader rivals. The result
will be a painful consolidation. In April alone, there were
nine mergers of banks and credit cooperatives, affecting both
big and small institutions. In one Tokyo neighborhood, a pair
of tiny, one-branch credit unions recently merged to become
the 175th-largest credit union -- the first marriage of
credit unions in 15 years.
   "We anticipate a complete reorganization of the industry,"
one government official says. Mindful of the problems after
the U.S. unfettered savings and loan associations a decade
and perhaps $500 billion ago, Japan seeks to deregulate
slowly and do it right. "We don't want to see an S&amp;L crisis,"
a Finance Ministry official says. He adds that Japan's
deposit-insurance program has only a few billion dollars in
assets -- not enough to bail out even one of the 100 biggest
banks in Japan.
   To avoid bank failures, the government is expected to take
an active role in the industry's consolidation, steering
troubled institutions into one another's arms. But the
gravest problem area lies outside the Finance Ministry's
usual realm, in the agricultural cooperatives. The parallels
between the cooperatives and America's S&amp;Ls worry many
analysts.
   Japan now has 3,700 co-ops, many of them small, one-branch
operations originally set up by American occupation forces to
collect deposits from farmers. The money then is either lent
to other farmers or channeled upstream to prefectural
cooperatives, which, in turn, lend it or pass it on to
Norinchukin, Japan's giant agricultural bank. Norinchukin
invests most of its money -- its assets totaled $235.7
billion as of March 31 -- in U.S. and Japanese government
bonds.
   As deregulation sets in, though, the financial
institutions in the agricultural sector will want the right
to invest elsewhere, much like what happened when U.S. S&amp;Ls
were unregulated. The agricultural sector was perfectly happy
with its earlier role, when it made money, largely through
its bond investments and the fixed spreads between deposit
and lending rates, and was in no hurry to change. Indeed,
agriculture's political clout is one reason some analysts
think that the Finance Ministry hasn't already acceded to
U.S. requests for complete interest-rate deregulation.
   "Financial reform will have an unfathomable impact on the
system of agricultural cooperatives, shaking it from the very
bottom," warns Yoshiyuki Onodera, a senior researcher at the
National Institute of Agricultural Economics. Comparing the
importance to the agricultural sector of importing foreign
rice -- long a contentious issue -- and the importance of
financial deregulation, Mr. Onodera says, "The difference in
impact is as great as that between TNT and the atomic bomb."
   When deposit rates are deregulated at all lending
institutions, the farm lobby contends, loan rates will rise,
and food prices may rise as well. Even worse, critics say,
farmers soon will expect higher returns on their co-op
deposits -- now, deposits of less than 10 million yen,
including the majority of accounts at agricultural
cooperatives, are regulated -- and when they do, the coops
will be in trouble. Either farmers will remove their money
from them and put it in commercial banks, or the co-ops will
have to find ways to earn more so they can afford to pay
more.
   To avert some problems, the Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Ministry hopes to close or merge two-thirds of the
co-ops by the year 2000. But even that is risky. Their loans
would have to be sold, and many of the loans are low-quality,
made by small-town co-ops to friendly businessmen or farmers.
One solution, an official suggests, would be to package the
loans and sell them as interest-bearing securities, perhaps
to Norinchukin.
   Doing that, however, would open another regulatory issue,
the separation of Japan's banking and securities industries.
Legislation patterned after the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act
prohibits the two industries from invading each other's turf.
Allowing banks to buy or sell securitized assets might broach
that line and bring securities firms into the fray.
   "Deregulation is happening faster than the banks
themselves can adjust," says James Russell, a Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. analyst here. "And there already is a lot more risk in
the system as a result."

   Mitsubishi Corp., Japan's largest trading company and
nucleus of the Mitsubishi group, announced Tuesday that in
its fiscal year ended March 31, it posted consolidated net
profit of 60.36 billion yen ($403.1 million), a record high
and up 31% from 46.13 billion yen the year before.
   Citing Japan's continued economic growth, Mitsubishi said
total trading transactions rose 18% in the year, to 18.523
trillion yen from 15.644 trillion yen.

<TEXT>
   A sharp rise in crude-oil trades and, reflecting strong
domestic demand, a jump in construction materials and
industrial-machinery sales buoyed the total, the company said
in its financial results.
   The consolidated report, which covered 314 subsidiaries
and 199 affiliated companies, showed gross trading profit
rose 25% to 482.91 billion yen from 386.26 billion yen,
helped by greater trading volume.
   Despite a notable rise in net interest costs and selling,
general and administrative expenses, income from consolidated
operations rose 51% to 42.79 billion yen from 28.39 billion
yen.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Lobbyists File In With Welcome Mats
   As State Capitols Take Bigger Role

   DES MOINES, Iowa -- Former state Senate Majority Leader
Lowell Junkins lost the gubernatorial race here four years
ago but settled on a second career: He became a political
strategist and lobbyist and today roams the Capitol on behalf
of a chemical company, a pharmaceutical giant, some banking
interests and the Iowa Community College Trustees
Association.
   Such a transformation has long been a staple of Washington
life, but only recently have legislative leaders, governors
and other political officeholders found that the road from a
political loss can lead directly to the lobbies of the state
capitols.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The explosion of lobbying at the state level is a
testament to the growing roles that the state legislatures
are facing in an era when the idiom of deregulation is being
spoken in Washington, when federal funds are drying up and
when the stakes in state issues -- the environment, consumer
affairs, business issues -- are growing. The prospect that
the state might institute new regulations on automobile
rentals in Florida, for example, prompted car-rental
companies to hire more than 40 lobbyists in Tallahassee this
spring.
   "Any large company that isn't represented in the Capitol
is running around nude," says Richard Thornton, a Des Moines
lobbyist whose clients include Allied Mutual Insurance Co.,
American Express Co., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., and Delta
Queen Steamboat Co. "With deregulation and all of these
issues floating around, there's always someone who's ready to
take a shot at you -- or to tax you."
   This year, Hill &amp; Knowlton, the public-relations
powerhouse that has long had a lobbying presence in
Washington, opened offices in Tallahassee; Albany, N.Y.;
Sacramento, Calif.; Springfield, Ill.; and Austin, Texas.
More offices in state capitals are planned for next year.
"The stakes are higher," says Alan Rosenthal, director of the
Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, "and
people know they can do better with lobbyists than they can
do themselves."
   Political reforms have been instituted in recent years to
clean up state legislatures. No longer, for example, do
lobbyists from the Farm Bureau and the Iowa Association of
Business and Industry stride into the legislative chambers
here and give hand signals to instruct lawmakers how to vote.
   But now the growth of lobbying is fundamentally altering
the character of these legislatures, which for a long time
were popularly regarded as unsophisticated citizen assemblies
and political backwaters. "We're witnessing the
congressionalization of state legislatures," says Iowa House
Speaker Donald Avenson, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate
in next month's primary.
   Moreover, the growth in state lobbying -- the number of
registered lobbyists in Iowa has doubled since 1984 -- is
prompting a growing skepticism of lobbyists here and in other
state capitals. "I won't have anything to do with them," says
Democratic state Rep. Dennis Black of Newton, Iowa. "There
are too many people working on us, and no good can come from
all these people running around the hall."
   The changes that lobbyists are bringing to state
legislatures are worrying even some of the former lawmakers
who have profited by the lobbying boom.
   "Candidates for state offices are turning to lobbyists for
money," says Mr. Junkins, the former Senate leader who now
does lobbying and political strategy for Du Pont Co. and
Pfizer Inc. "I don't see people who are making commitments
for the money, but the day will come."
   Mr. Avenson, for example, has accepted about $44,000 from
various interests, primarily labor groups. GOP Gov. Terry
Branstad, drawing primarily on business and industry groups,
has accepted about $17,000. "People aren't saying that
they'll do something if you give them money," Mr. Junkins
says. "But if you ask for $5,000 from a stranger, it's
relatively clear there's an understanding. They wouldn't be
giving the money if there weren't."
   Lawmakers dismiss the notion that the role lobbyists are
playing is tainting votes in the chamber.
   "We all raise money -- we have to -- but we don't tie it
to votes," says Florida Senate President Bob Crawford, a
14-year veteran of the legislature. "Lobbyists who try to tie
votes to campaign contributions can inflict a lot of damage
to the institution." Willie Brown, speaker of the California
Assembly, adds: "The advice given by lobbyists is usually to
pay them first and contribute to campaigns later."
   Indeed, lobbying has turned into a growth industry. "I'm
amazed at the amount of money you can make," says Bruce
Bereano, who lobbies in Maryland's capital of Annapolis for
53 clients ranging from the Tobacco Institute to Weight
Watchers International. Last year Mr. Bereano reported fees
of $1,034,158.
   As the lobbying surge continues at the state level, a
number of organizations have sprung up to take advantage of
new business opportunities in state capitals.
   The Legislative Information Network Corp., an Austin-based
company, is creating a computer data base to track bills,
amendments and even committee votes in all 50 state
legislatures. Multi-State Associates, a Great Neck, N.Y.,
company, has developed a network of 1,500 professional
lobbyists across the country and last year did close to $5
million in lobbying services.
   Businesses turn to these lobbying companies because they
can't keep up with government activities in 50 separate
arenas.
   "At the state level, things move with frightening speed,"
says Stephen Lisson, the president of Legislative Information
Network Corp. "At the federal level committees are kicking
out one bill a year. In individual states, you have dozens of
committees kicking out hundreds of bills within a few
months."
   Some of those involved in the new lobbying believe that
the increased attention devoted to lobbying efforts has
cleansed the process, stripping away the mystery and the
secrecy that surrounded lobbying for decades.
   "There's more lobbying, but the lobbying is more open than
it was in the old days," says Edward Campbell, a former Iowa
Democratic chairman who today lobbies for companies such as
Anheuser Busch Cos., IBP Inc., First Banks of Minneapolis and
Star Coal Co. "There used to be only the railroads and the
bankers and the utility companies and people like that," says
Mr. Campbell. "They ran the show. They walked on the floor.
Now there are more than 400 of us, and we can't walk on the
floor."

                    The Lobbying Surge
                                                                                                       

   The number of registered lobbyists has increased in many
states. Because lobby registration regulations are loose and
vary from state to state, these figures in many cases
substantially understate the number of lobbyists working in
the state capitals. Some of the figures are estimates.

   LONDON -- Barely a year ago, shipping U.S. computers to
the Soviet nuclear-power industry would have been
unthinkable.
   The U.S. and its allies have blocked sales of such
high-tech gear for years, lest it help Soviet defense. Soviet
weapons designers could log onto the computers, says Frank
Gaffney Jr., a former Pentagon official who currently runs a
conservative Washington think-tank.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We've got to be very chary of providing technology that
is manifestly related to military purposes," he says.
   But Mr. Gaffney is fighting a losing battle. A major
liberalization in East-West technology trade is in the works
in Washington, Paris, Bonn, Tokyo and other Western-alliance
capitals. Barring any sudden hitches in superpower relations,
Washington appears likely to approve the sale of six Control
Data Corp. computers to Moscow to analyze safety at Soviet
reactors.
   Bush administration officials "are very sympathetic toward
trying to help out" the Soviets on nuclear-power safety, says
a person close to the deliberations. "Nobody wants another
Chernobyl to happen."
   The Control Data order is the first of what is likely to
become a flow of technology to the East. With the Cold War
declared over, a secretive organization of the U.S. and its
16 main allies plans to meet June 6-7 in Paris to authorize a
major relaxation in trade restrictions.
   For 41 years, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls, or Cocom, has dictated what can be legally
shipped to Communist countries. Though not always fully
enforced, the Cocom guidelines have blocked large-scale
shipments of computers, machine tools and other technological
products to the East, and have hampered Eastern efforts to
acquire Western know-how.
   At the Paris meeting, Western officials plan to maintain
the embargo on key technologies but deregulate trade in many
others. East Germany, several Cocom participants say, will
likely be designated a special trade zone, freed from all but
the most important controls. West German companies will be
able to export products to East Germany except those with
obvious military uses, such as certain radars, ultrasonic
sensors for ships and supercomputers. The plan risks allowing
re-export to other Eastern countries, but it is motivated by
pragmatism. With the two Germanys unifying, says one Bonn
official, customs officials couldn't successfully police the
old, strict embargo.
   The East-bloc countries will also get new trade
privileges, though not as great as East Germany. Cocom
negotiators tentatively have agreed to allow unregulated
trade in most personal computers, up to 386-model PCs with a
data-processing speed of 275 megabits a second; that is a
nearly four-fold rise in Cocom standards.
   More important, the negotiators plan to grant "favorable
consideration" on a case-by-case basis to licensing shipments
of more-powerful computers with processing speeds up to 1,000
megabits; that covers all PCs, most engineering workstations
and minicomputers, and many mainframe computers. Still
undecided is whether to go even further for Poland, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia, to a processing speed of 2,000 megabits,
covering all models except supercomputers and special
mainframes with so-called vector arrays for high-speed number
crunching.
   Next week's Paris meeting will also deregulate trade in
many telecommunications products and machine tools; other
products may be liberalized later this year. The Paris
meeting, though important, "is just the beginning," says
another European government official.
   In 1987, the U.S., Japan, Britain, France, Italy and West
Germany shipped $1.12 billion of technology products to the
Soviet Union and its allies, according to a recent study by
the Economist Intelligence Unit, a London-based consulting
firm. About a third of that was in computers; nearly half was
from West Germany. Some economists forecast a doubling of
East-West trade.
   One certain, immediate result of Cocom liberalization will
be a further surge in joint ventures between East and West
technology companies. Such ventures cost the East-bloc
companies little, and offer Western ones a chance to cash in
later on a reconstructed East. U.S. computer-maker Digital
Equipment Corp., for instance, began its first East-bloc
venture three months ago in Hungary. With Cocom
liberalization coming, "We plan to be moving aggressively
into the rest of Eastern Europe," a spokesman says.
   "U.S. companies that come in {to the Soviet Union} for
joint ventures don't want to mess around with Soviet junk"
for computers, says William McHenry, a specialist in Soviet
computing at Georgetown University's School of Business
Administration.
   But it isn't all junk in East-bloc computing. The Soviets
make mainframe computers that approach Western speeds, and
the Bulgarians make a supercomputer. But Eastern computers
break down easily, are scarce, and often can't use
performance-boosting Western software. Mr. McHenry says
Soviet mainframes typically need repairs after running for
250 to 500 hours, a fraction of Western standards. He
estimates the Soviets have 500,000 to one million PCs; the
U.S. has about 40 million.
   Thus, even a relatively modest rise in East-West computer
trade could make a big difference to some Soviet industries.
The Soviet nuclear-power industry is a prime example. At the
Ignalina nuclear-power station in Lithuania, operators rely
on a Soviet SM-2 computer system that was already six years
behind the West when it was installed in 1981. At a
reactor-training school in Smolensk, operators learn accident
responses on a computer simulator that runs at five million
instructions a second, the power of a moderate Western PC,
Soviet officials say.
   Indeed, Western and Soviet nuclear experts say inadequate
computers contributed to the 1986 Chernobyl accident. Says
Nikolai Shteinberg, deputy chairman of the U.S.S.R. State
Committee on Supervision of Nuclear Power Safety: "If the
plant personnel had had enough information {from computers}
on what was happening, I guarantee there would have been no
accident" at Chernobyl.
   The Control Data order is for six Cyber 962 mainframes,
five for the country's main reactor-design labs and the sixth
for post-accident research at Chernobyl itself. Mr. Gaffney,
the ex-Pentagon official, contends the computers could end up
being used by military researchers.
   But Control Data says it plans safeguards against such
misuse. These include having company staff visit the
computers to check for signs of military usage, and may also
include a software "log" to record the number-crunching being
performed on a machine. Such measures, a spokesman concedes,
can't guarantee against misuse, but they reduce the odds of
it going undetected.

   Autos:
   Ford Plan
   May Make
   Buyers Wait

   DETROIT -- Consumers looking to buy a Ford might want to
consider a better idea: Wait until this fall.
   Ford Motor Co., in a letter to dealers, says it may nearly
double the incentives it now offers on 1990 model cars after
new 1991 models begin to appear in showrooms this October.
The move is aimed at encouraging dealers to stock up now on
new 1990 cars by assuring them that Ford will protect them
from taking a bath should the cars sit in showrooms past
Sept. 30.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the disclosure of Ford's year-end clearance strategy
could undermine the auto maker's efforts to boost its lagging
sales now. While Ford declined to comment on its incentive
plans, which were disclosed yesterday in the trade journal
Automotive News, one Ford spokesman acknowledged that
publicity about the company's fall incentive program could
hurt sales this summer. "It depends to a large extent on the
degree to which {the plans are} reported," he said.
   Furthermore, several dealers who confirmed details of the
incentive program say they don't like the letter's
implication that if they don't beef up orders, they might not
get the vehicles they need later this summer.
   "We aren't going to be moved by threats," says Jim Hoffer,
general sales manager for Jordan Ford in Mishawaka, Ind. Mr.
Hoffer said he was paid an unusual sales call last week by
Ford officials, who strongly suggested that his dealership
increase its order level. It didn't.
   Currently, Ford offers cash and financing incentives
averaging about $1,000 a vehicle. But Ford's letter to
dealers says it plans to boost cash incentives this fall on
1990 models by between $400 and $1,500 a vehicle under the
model year-end clearance program.
   Such a round of price cutting by Ford, particularly in the
current soft market, could spur further industrywide
discounting, analysts say. "When someone as big as Ford gets
aggressive on incentives, then everyone is going to have to
follow," says John Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder.
"I don't think there's any way around that."
   Year-end clearance sales aren't unusual in the auto
industry. In recent years, generous year-end discounts have
sent sales soaring during the fall and winter months. But
Ford appears to be telegraphing its strategy earlier and in
more detail than it has in the past.
   The move comes at a time when Ford is struggling to firm
up its sagging market share and keep its U.S. factories
running at full speed. Ford's share of U.S. car sales dropped
to 21.5% from 23.2% through the first four months of this
year. The slippage results in part from the limited
availability of the new Ford Escort subcompact, traditionally
one of Ford's best-selling models.
   More importantly, dealer reluctance to order new cars has
forced Ford since April 1 to order one-week shutdowns at four
North American car assembly plants, including the two
factories that build the popular Taurus and Sable midsized
cars. Ford warned dealers in the letter that if they continue
to hold back on orders, "it could lead to substantial dealer
{product} flow interruptions," particularly when the
company's plants take scheduled two-week vacations in July.
   Some dealers describe Ford's effort as heavyhanded and say
it could backfire. "I'm not going to change my ordering
habits because of what Ford says," according to Frank Meccia,
general sales manager of Al Piemonte Ford near Chicago. In an
effort to save on inventory carrying costs, Mr. Meccia's
dealership is trying to maintain a 45-day to 60-day supply of
cars, almost half of what it has during times of strong car
sales.
   Ford has been trying in recent weeks to reduce the amount
it's spending for consumer incentives. Ford officials laid
some of the blame for lackluster first-quarter earnings on
heavy discounting in the U.S. In early May, the auto maker
cut its average rebate by about $200 a vehicle, to about
$1,000.
   Ford dealers say the letter indicates consumers will see
bigger discounts in the fall. But it isn't clear that Ford
will spend more money for the proposed program of rebates
than it has for its traditional year-end clearance tool:
giving dealers a 5% discount on cars left on the lots after a
new model year begins. That program, now discontinued, was
more popular with dealers because it gave them the
flexibility to offer discounts to consumers or bonuses to top
salesmen -- or to pocket some of the money themselves.
   By using varying amounts of cash incentives, instead of a
flat percentage, Ford may improve its ability to move
vehicles that have bigger inventories or are in more
competitive markets.
   Ford's letter to dealers also says the company may offer
enhanced incentives as early as this summer to clear out 1990
models in advance of the 1991 model year. Such a move might
fuel a growing problem with buyer incentives: Their constant
ups and downs bewilder consumers, who want to buy when the
rebates are the highest but don't know when that will be.
Says Martin J. McInerney, who has several dealerships in
Detroit and Florida: "The programs are so confusing that it
takes a Philadelphia lawyer to figure them out."

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices rocketed higher, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index to records.
   The industrial average closed with a gain of 49.57 points
to 2870.49.

   Some analysts thanked Mikhail Gorbachev for the unexpected
rally, while others thanked IBM.
   The Soviet president arrives in Washington today for a
four-day summit beginning tomorrow. Some market minders say
summit meetings often spark stock rallies, and that Mr.
Gorbachev has a particularly strong effect on the market.
   But International Business Machines was clearly the leader
in the stock market. IBM soared 3 1/2, or 3%, to 119 3/4,
more than compensating for the 2 1/2 point loss incurred in
Friday's sell-off. The stock's strength was attributable in
part to this week's Barron's, which featured Big Blue in its
cover story.
   IBM's early strength appeared to rally stocks from their
weak opening to move higher throughout the day. The gains
surprised many, who had expected Friday's steep sell-off to
carry over into yesterday.
   "We deserved a down day," says Ralph J. Acampora, head of
technical research at Kidder Peabody.
   A late spate of computer-driven buy programs kicked the
market to new highs.
   The final upward surge also broke the S&amp;P 500 index above
its previous all-time high. The index of the market's 500
largest stocks closed at 360.65, on a 6.07-point advance,
surpassing its high set last October.
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 2.86 to
196.57, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 5.08 to
335.42.
   Advancers led decliners by 1,107 to 434, with 462 stocks
ending unchanged. Volume rose to 137,410,000 shares from
120,250,000 shares Friday.
   Don R. Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat
First Butcher &amp; Singer, said the S&amp;P 500 record may give the
market added assurance.
   He said the rally might carry the industrial average above
the 2900 level before it runs out of steam, despite the fact
that many of the blue-chip stocks have risen too high, too
fast.
   A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, said
stocks may get another boost from economic data due at the
end of the week.
   On Friday, the Labor Department will release its report
for May U.S. employment.
   Mr. Moore believes that data will strengthen the belief
that the economy is slowing and that interest rates ought to
come down. The bond market should react favorably to the
news, giving bonds further room to rally, he said.
   Many market watchers noted that the one ingredient missing
from yesterday's rally was strong volume. Trading was
particularly quiet until the final half hour, they said.
   IBM surged to a 52-week high for the stock. Other
technology stocks followed. Computer maker Compaq rose 1 3/4
to 120 3/8.
   Philip Morris was high on the most active list, ending
unchanged at 42 1/2. The stock came under pressure late last
week as some money managers began cutting their exposure to
tobacco companies after a government agency proposed new
restrictions on cigarette sales.
   Time Warner gained 3 3/8 to 109. In this week's Barron's,
money manager Michael Price calls the stock "undervalued."
The stock had fallen with other cable television shares over
fears of new regulation in that industry. But market players
now expect any regulation to be less stringent than
originally feared.
   Merrill Lynch slipped 5/8 to 24 1/8. The company may need
to add as much as $200 million to reserves this year to cover
soured bridge loans and other forms of junk-bond exposure,
The Wall Street Journal reported. The company took a $470
million pretax charge last year.
   Tektronix added 1 to 15 3/8. The company said it expects
to take a $70 million restructuring charge in its fiscal
fourth quarter ended Saturday. The restructuring will involve
the layoff of about 10% of its employees. The company also
says it ended talks to sell its Grass Valley Group unit to
Japan's Sony.
   L.A. Gear fell 1 3/4 to 47 3/8 as investors began slicing
fat off the stock. Kidder Peabody cut its rating on the
athletic footwear maker's shares to "hold" from "current
buy," saying that the stock has run about as far as it can go
for now.
   Rival Reebok International, meanwhile, added 5/8 to 19
1/4, while Nike rose 1 3/4 to 81 3/4 in over-the-counter
trading.
   Bank of New England eased 3/8 to 3 1/8. The Journal
reported that James F. McNally, chairman of the bank's
Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust unit, intends to retire this summer.
Mr. McNally's successor has yet to be named.
   Tyco Laboratories added 2 1/2 to 50 3/4. The company said
it expects to report sales of about $2.1 billion in the year
ending tomorrow, up from sales of $1.97 billion last year.
Tyco also agreed to buy the operating assets of an Australian
maker of fire protection equipment for $350 million in cash.
The added revenue from Wormald should boost fiscal 1991 sales
to $3.45 billion, Tyco said.
   Corning Glass Works dropped 1 3/8 to 48 3/4. Donaldson
Lufkin Jenrette turned neutral on the stock, after having
recently rated it as "moderately attractive," according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 2.72
to 362.56. Amex volume totaled 11,440,000 shares, compared
with 11,400,000 shares Friday. There were 300 issues
advancing, 239 declining and 241 issues were unchanged.

warrant to purchase one-fourth of a Great Lakes common share.
The underwriters also have been granted a 30-day option to
buy as many as 225,000 additional preferred units. The price
will be $10 a unit; the minimum purchase will be 100 units.
Quarterly dividends will be paid, if declared, at an annual
rate of $10 a preferred share through June 30, 1995.
Subsequently, the dividend rate will adjust quarterly to 250
basis points over the one-year Treasury bill rate, multiplied
by the $100 stated value of the preferred stock; a basis
point is equal to 1/100th of one percentage point. But the
dividend rate for any quarterly period won't amount to less
than $10 a year or greater than $15 a year. The offering will
be underwritten by Roney &amp; Co., Detroit, and Ohio Co.,
Columbus.

   Chicago West Pullman Corp. said it has stopped exploring
its options in connection with a possible new bid to acquire
American Steel &amp; Wire Corp. in light of the company's plans
to pay a special dividend of $4.25 a share.
   In December, Chicago West said it was reviewing its
options after the rejection of a sweetened $9.50-a-share bid
for American Steel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Chicago West noted, however, that it reserves the right to
buy more shares, or sell shares in the open market or in
private transactions, with third parties. Chicago West did
not disclose its current American Steel stake in the filing.
   American West is based in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio.

   Market Surges as Technology Stocks
   Continue to Spur Gains; Adobe Rebounds

   Over-the-counter stocks rebounded in quiet post-holiday
trading, but trailed the gains of exchange-listed issues.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.82 to 457.51, a 0.84%
gain, compared with the 1.76% jump in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. Advancing shares led decliners, 1,014 to
868, as volume slipped to 133.9 million from 152.2 million
Friday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It was a typical bounce back on a quiet day," said
Richard Bruno, head of BUSY OTC trading at PaineWebber,
adding that some investors appeared to still be out for the
long Memorial Day weekend. Mr. Bruno said he saw a number of
institutions buying technology shares in the wake of Friday's
1% decline in the OTC market, led by the 15 1/4 plunge of
Adobe Systems.
   Adobe rebounded 2 5/8 to 37 7/8 yesterday, joining other
technology shares in a surge led by the 3 1/2 point advance,
to 119 3/4, of International Business Machines. Apple
Computer rose 1 to 41; Intel added 1 1/8 to 48 5/8; Oracle
Systems gained 3/4 to 19 7/8; Seagate Technology advanced 1/2
to 14 1/4 and Sun Microsystems climbed 1/4 to 30 1/2.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst David Nelson said he is
sticking with the brokerage firm's top investment rating on
Adobe. Mr. Nelson said he believes the shortfall in the
Mountain View, Calif., software maker's revenue is temporary.
   The analyst, who Friday cut his 1990 and 1991 earnings
estimates for the company by 30 cents a share, yesterday
added 15 cents a share to Friday's estimates after reviewing
the company's earnings outlook in more detail over the
weekend.
   Mr. Nelson said he now estimates Adobe will earn $2 a
share this year and $2.75 in 1991, compared with $1.55 in
1989.
   Cabot Medical rose 13/16 to 5 5/8 on more than 11 times
average volume. Warren G. Wood, president and chief executive
officer of the Langhorne, Pa., medical-instrument maker, told
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report there weren't any
corporate developments to explain the increased trading
activity. W.H. Newbold's Son &amp; Co. analyst Edward J.
Stevetski suggested Cabot Medical's recent quarterly earnings
report and an advertisement about the company in Monday's
edition of Barron's might have drawn investors to the stock.
   Harris &amp; Harris Group gained 5/16 to 2 7/8 on more than
1.1 million shares after Worms &amp; Co. reported that it cut its
stake in the New York insurance brokerage and financial
management group to 4.6% of its common shares outstanding.
Worms didn't give a reason for reducing its holdings. Stocks
sometimes gain after the sale of stock removes downward
pressure on the shares.
   Sun Sportswear tumbled 2 1/8 to 10 5/8 on more than 18
times average volume. Deborah Skiles, vice president of
finance for the Kent, Wash., clothing designer and marketer,
said in an interview the stock apparently fell in reaction to
a report by Piper Jaffray Hopwood analyst Richard E. Pyle,
who cut his earnings estimates for the company's second
quarter by 33% and full year projection by 15% because of
sluggish order rates, according to DJPIR. However, Mr. Pyle
continues to rate the stock a "buy," DJPIR said. Ms. Skiles
said she agreed with "the trend" of Mr. Pyle's downward
revisions, but declined to comment on his specific estimates.
   Big B dropped 1 3/8 to 9 7/8 after the Bessemer, Ala.,
operator of drug and food stores reported net income for the
first quarter ended May 12 of five cents a share, down from
30 cents a year earlier. Big B attributed the profit fall
primarily to financing costs and operating losses from 85
stores it acquired in February 1989.
   Bio-Logic Systems stumbled 3/4 to 4 1/4 after the
Mundelein, Ill., designer and marketer of computerized
diagnostic systems reported net income for the 1990 fiscal
year ended Feb. 28 of 13 cents a share, down from 21 cents a
year earlier.
   Statewide Bancorp slid 1 1/4 to 7 1/2 after the Toms
River, N.J., bank said late Friday that it increased its
allowance for loan losses by $30 million, suspended its
quarterly 20-cents-a-share dividend and agreed to a close
review of its main subsidiary under an agreement with the
comptroller of the currency.
   Silk Greenhouse slid 1/4 to 4 1/2 after PIR said that some
analysts are concerned about inventory levels and credit
conditions outlined by the Tampa, Fla., operator of
artificial flower stores in its latest quarterly filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Analyst Harry G. Katica of Raymond, James &amp; Associates,
which co-managed Silk Greenhouse's initial public offering
two years ago, told DJPIR that he now recommends investors
sell their Silk Greenhouse holdings. However, Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons analyst Fred E. Wintzer Jr. said he continues to hope
the retailer can turn itself around, although he has a "hold"
opinion on it. Silk Greenhouse Chairman and President Jere L.
Bradwell declined to comment.

   CBS and Fox Adopt Risky TV Strategies
   In Fight to Capture Prime Time's Crown

   NEW YORK -- The CBS and Fox networks unveiled bold and
risky strategies in their prime-time television schedules,
with CBS revamping much of its troubled lineup and Fox taking
aim at NBC's juggernaut Thursday roster.
   CBS, the No. 3 network in prime time for three years,
added 10 shows it hopes will attract the younger audience
that advertisers seek -- and one that has eluded the network
for decades. The CBS Inc. unit will try new lead-off shows in
the 8 p.m. slot on five nights of the week, trying to bolster
the major weakness of its schedule.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co., doing surprisingly well
with only three nights a week of programming, is adding two
more nights and throwing its biggest hit -- the cartoon
series "The Simpsons" -- against one of the most potent
comedies in TV history, NBC's "The Cosby Show."
   A network rarely moves a new hit to a new night. But
pitting "The Simpsons" against "Cosby" underscores a
widespread belief in the TV industry that NBC's Thursday
lineup is weakening -- and that Bill Cosby, in particular,
might be vulnerable to spiky-haired Bart Simpson.
   "We're going after them," said Peter Chernin, Fox's top
programming executive. Brandon Tartikoff, NBC Entertainment
president, said he welcomes the challenge.
   CBS also senses weakness in NBC's Thursday lineup. It is
moving the CBS News series "48 Hours" from 8 p.m. Thurdays to
10 p.m. Saturdays -- the lowest-viewing night of the week --
to try "The Flash," based on a comic book superhero. "Ours
not to reason why, ours but to do or die," said Dan Rather,
the CBS News anchorman who also hosts "48 Hours."
   Both CBS and Fox canceled a plethora of shows.
   Of CBS's nine series introduced last fall, only one,
"Major Dad," is an outright survivor. CBS will have new
lineups on five nights. CBS axed "Tour of Duty," its
two-year-old Vietnam war series. "Wiseguy" won't be on the
fall schedule but will return later in the season -- without
actor Ken Wahl. The fate of the western "Paradise" is
uncertain.
   CBS also will revamp "Saturday Night with Connie Chung"
and move the reworked show, "Face to Face with Connie Chung,"
to 10 p.m. Mondays. Jeff Sagansky, CBS Entertainment
president, said the show will be "more celebrity driven" than
the Saturday series.
   CBS also killed "City," "Sydney," "Sugar and Spice,"
"Loose Cannon," and "Normal Life." "Falcon Crest" and
"Newhart" also will disappear from the schedule following
long runs.
   The CBS schedule seems to shy away from the daring
concepts of some rivals.
   Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC has its oddball drama "Twin
Peaks" and the musical, "Cop Rock." NBC, a unit of General
Electric Co., has a comedy starring rapper Fresh Prince, as
well as a musical set in a high school.
   CBS will stick with traditional TV comedies, trying five:
"Uncle Buck," based on a John Candy movie and seen as the
best newcomer on CBS; "Lenny," a blue-collar guy with three
kids; "The Hammersmiths," a one-hour comedy about an extended
family; "Evening Shade," with Burt Reynolds, and "Four Alarm
Family," a single father rearing four sons.
   One-hour dramas on CBS include "WIOU," about a struggling
Midwest news station, and "Over My Dead Body," with Edward
Woodward as a mystery writer akin to Angela Lansbury in CBS's
"Murder, She Wrote." "The Green Machine" is about an
environmental A-Team.
   At Fox, five current shows have been yanked: "21 Jump
Street," its first breakthrough series; its spinoff,
"Booker"; "Alien Nation"; "Open House," and the much-touted
young-toughs series from Francis Ford Coppola, "The
Outsiders." The demise of two others already had been set:
"It's Garry Shandling's Show" and "The Tracey Ullman Show."
   Fox, now airing shows on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays,
will add nine new programs as it expands to Thursdays and
Fridays. "American Chronicles" is from "Twin Peaks"
co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost and is a "video novel"
about "extraordinary people." The new comedies include
"Babes," about three sisters; "True Colors," about an
interracial marriage; and "Parker Lewis Can't Lose," about a
high school student.
   New dramas on Fox include "D.E.A.," about drug agents,
which will follow the manhunt show "America's Most Wanted."
"Class of Beverly Hills" is about a Midwest family
transplanted to the Los Angeles suburb, and "Against the
Law," is about yet another cracker-jack attorney.

   Shearson's Chief
   Of Brokers Seeks
   To Restore Morale

   NEW YORK -- The new head of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s
brokerage and money-management businesses said he aims to
restore morale of his 10,000-broker sales force.
   Jonathan S. Linen, currently a top executive at American
Express Co., Shearson's parent, was named to the new position
at struggling Shearson; the move officially takes effect next
week. The appointment by American Express was expected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You've got a great institution here with a lot of great
people who've been struggling in an environment {on Wall
Street} that's a little bit debilitating, without a great
deal of consumer confidence," Mr. Linen said in an interview.
   He said it was too early to discuss if Shearson might
close more than the 67 brokerage offices it already has this
year, leaving 450. But Mr. Linen added: "All bets are open
right now."
   Mr. Linen, 46 years old, was head of the traveler's
checks, direct marketing and publishing group of American
Express Travel Related Services Co. At Shearson, he will have
the title of president and chief executive officer of the
Private Client Group and asset management businesses.
   Mr. Linen's appointment anticipates the planned split-up
of Shearson into two halves: its brokerage network and
money-management businesses that he will head, and its
investment banking and trading operations. The split-up is
part of American Express's efforts to reorganize and revive
Shearson, which had an industry record loss of $915 million
in the first quarter because of retrenchment expenses.
   After talking with many of Shearson's 10,000 brokers
yesterday, Mr. Linen acknowledged that broker morale isn't
ideal. "My perception is, based on a day on the job, that
things aren't settled down yet," he said. His goal: "Make
money and have fun."
   Mr. Linen will report to Howard L. Clark Jr., a former
American Express chief financial officer, who remains
Shearson's chairman. Mr. Clark said in a statement that Mr.
Linen's "customer and quality driven management philosophy
will find a receptive audience here at Shearson Lehman, as we
all work to strengthen our position as a premier securities
firm."
   Mr. Linen said that he has "no illusions" about his lack
of brokerage-industry experience, but that his
consumer-marketing experience will help him. Asked if he can
hold his own with Shearson's independent-minded brokers. Mr.
Linen said he thought he could. "Try dealing with 1,500
travel agents," he joked.
   In his new post, Mr. Linen succeeds Hardwick Simmons, head
of the Private Client Group, who resigned last week. The
asset-management businesses had been reporting to Shearson
Vice Chairman Herbert Freiman, who remains head of Shearson's
capital-commitment committee.
   American Express this year has shaken up Shearson
management, pumped more than $1 billion into the brokerage
firm to replenish its capital base and announced plans to
acquire the Shearson common stock that it doesn't already
own.

   BROOKLYN UNION GAS Co. (Brooklyn, N.Y.) -- Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it reduced its ratings on this utility's

to single-A from single-A-plus. The rating concern also
downgraded Brooklyn Union Gas's commercial paper rating to
single-A-1 from single-A-1- plus. S&amp;P said, "The downgrades
reflect the company's weak financial profile relative to the
former ratings, in large part due to less than supportive

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. named
Allan S. Huston president of its international business, the
largest chain of restaurants abroad.
   Mr. Huston, 46 years old, was formerly senior vice
president, operations, at Pizza Hut, which, like Kentucky
Fried Chicken, is a unit of PepsiCo Inc., based in Purchase,
N.Y.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Huston succeeds Donald L. Pierce, 45, who resigned to
become president of Pentagram Corp., a restaurant operator in
Hawaii. Calling the Pentagram post a "unique opportunity,"
Mr. Pierce said he wanted to change jobs partly to cut down
on the amount of time he has spent traveling.
   Since 1988, when Mr. Pierce assumed his post, Kentucky
Fried Chicken's international business has had double-digit
earnings gains.
   Mr. Huston's appointment is the latest in a series of
high-level management changes at the chain. Since last
summer, the company, which has had a sluggish domestic
business, has appointed a new corporate president, a new top
marketing executive and new head for its U.S. business.

   NEW YORK -- The bond market recovered from Friday's slump
as a light wave of bullish sentiment buoyed prices.
   Traders said investors returned from the long Memorial Day
weekend in a relatively good mood after focusing on numerous
positive technical and fundamental indicators. Many of these
indicators, such as sluggish money supply growth and falling
commodity prices, have fueled perceptions that the economy is
growing weaker and that interest rates will eventually fall.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose about 1/2 point,
a gain of about $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
advance about offset Friday's loss when the 30-year bond fell
5/8 point. Financial markets were closed Monday.
   Dealers said bond prices began to rise in early trading as
the value of the dollar rose against the yen in foreign
exchange markets. Michael Moore, manager of government
trading at Continental Bank, said the dollar "set a favorable
tone for the bond market" that lasted all day.
   In addition, economists and traders said investors were
heartened by recent trends in the money supply, which has
been growing more slowly.
   Mickey Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bank Corp.,
said the slow growth in the nation's money supply "portends
continued sluggish economic activity and lower inflation" for
several months. If the money supply continues to grow at the
current slow pace, Mr. Levy believes the Federal Reserve may
be forced to eventually cut interest rates in an effort to
stimulate the economy.
   Bond prices were also helped by perceptions that recent
declines in commodity prices will continue. The Commodity
Research Bureau's futures index, which includes 21
commodities and is viewed as an inflation gauge, fell 1.97
points to 244.33.
   Trading activity was quiet, which is normal for the week
when the potentially market-moving employment report is due
to be released. Trading often slows considerably ahead of the
jobs report, which is considered the most important economic
indicator released during the month.
   Given the bond market's preoccupation with the employment
data, which will provide the first look at how the economy
fared this month, today's reports on April leading indicators
and new home sales shouldn't have much impact on bond prices
unless they differ sharply from expectations, analysts said.
   Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
expect, on average, that the U.S. composite index of leading
indicators fell 0.2% and that new single-family home sales
slipped 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 572,000
from March's 574,000 annual rate.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 101 10/32 to yield
8.62%, compared with 100 25/32 to yield 8.66%. The latest
10-year notes ended at 101 15/32 to yield 8.63%, compared
with 101 5/32 to yield 8.68%.
   The Treasury sold a total of $16.8 billion of bills
yesterday at the government's regular weekly auction. The
average discount rate for three-month bills was 7.80%, and
the average rate for six-month bills was 7.74%. The rate on
three-month bills was up from last week's auction when it was
7.74%. The rate on six-month bills was down from last week's
auction when it was 7.79%.
   Here are auction details:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

percentage points.
   Trading was light throughout the day. Traders said that
despite taking on a large supply of derivative products last
week, the market appears ready to take on more supply.
   Ginnie Mae 9% securities were up 5/32 at 95 24/32, and the
10% securities were at 100 12/32, up 4/32. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 10% securities were up 4/32 at 99 26/32, as
were the 10 1/2% securities, at 101 14/32. Federal National
Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities were up 5/32 at 98
10/32. The 10% securities, at 100 11/32, were up 4/32.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Prices of R.H. Macy &amp; Co.'s recently battered junk bonds
stabilized after gyrating wildly last week.
   Macy's 14 1/2% subordinated debentures, due in 2001, ended
little changed at 59, while the retailer's 14 1/2% senior
subordinated debentures, maturing in 1998, finished
unchanged, at 69.
   There was little trading in the retailer's bonds, and
market participants said activity in the broader high-yield
market was quiet as high-yield investors trickled back from
the holiday weekend.
   Macy's bonds plunged initially last week on news that some
lenders were tightening credit standards for the retailer.
The bonds managed to stage a partial rebound after the
retailer reported preliminary third-quarter results that
exceeded market expectations.
   Meanwhile, in the broader high-yield market, most junk
bonds, or speculative-grade bonds with low credit ratings or
no credit ratings, ended unchanged.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, actively
traded high-grade issues finished unchanged to about 1/8
point higher in very thin trading.
   Yesterday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
the ratings for the senior and senior subordinated debt of
Memorex Telex Corp. to single-B-2 from single-B-1 and to
single-B-3 from single-B-2, respectively. The agency said
$1.2 billion of securities are affected.
   Moody's said it based its action "on the deteriorated
business outlook for the company caused by industrywide
aggressive pricing and warranty strategies, which are slowly
eroding the market niches for suppliers of plug-compatible
peripherals. Consequently, Memorex Telex' weak financial
measures are likely to continue over the intermediate term
and liquidity will be tight."
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Following the lead of Treasurys, municipal bonds were
unchanged to as much as 1/4 point higher in late dealings.
   Despite the slight gains, traders expect little movement
in the market ahead of the release of May employment data
Friday.
   In new issue activity, a Dillon, Read &amp; Co. group priced
$132 million of Texas Turnpike Authority revenue bonds.
   Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 rose 1/4 point to 97 7/8 to
yield 7.38%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Profit-taking and a decline in the value of the yen pushed
Japanese government bond prices lower.
   The selling began at the start of trading and continued
throughout the day. "People were trading {bonds} while
watching the foreign exchange market," said a trader at one
of Japan's major banks.
   Dealers said expectations that short-term rates aren't
likely to fall anytime soon added to the bearish tone of
trading and prompted some investors to take profits. Rates on
new three-month certificates of deposit ended unchanged at
about 7.4%.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan's
benchmark 10-year issue was quoted at a price of 87.89, down
0.62 point, to yield 6.99%. The yield opened in
over-the-counter trading at a low of 6.835% and ranged as
high as 7.02%. (Japanese yields are stated in local terms,
but they would be lower if calculated by the semiannual
compound measure used in the U.S.)

   Judith Fellheimer Quits Equimark Post,
   In Suprise End to Husband-Wife Team
   ----

   PITTSBURGH -- Judith E. Fellheimer resigned her top
management position at Equimark Corp., bringing a surprise
end to the bank holding company's controversial husband-wife
management team.
   The departure of Mrs. Fellheimer, who is credited with
helping her husband, Alan S. Fellheimer, save Equimark after
he became chairman in 1985, comes several months after she
was promoted to vice chairman of the bank's main subsidiary,
Equibank. And it comes amid growing turmoil at the bank. In
recent weeks, Equimark has had to abort its nine-month effort
to acquire a Texas bank, has dismissed a half-dozen senior
managers and has seen its stock price continue to erode.
Rumors have also circulated that the bank will be put up for
sale, but Mr. Fellheimer says he has no such plans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday's announcement marks a stunning personal change
for the Fellheimers. When the couple married 15 years ago,
they pledged they would be business partners forever, and
until yesterday had kept that vow.
   In separate interviews, the Fellheimers said the
resignation reflects broad cost-cutting measures that the
bank, which had a $15.4 million loss in the last quarter, has
been forced to take. A total of about 20 managers had already
been dismissed, but more cuts were needed.
   Mr. Fellheimer said his wife "technically agreed to be
terminated, but without cause." He indicated that she would
be given a yet-to-determined severance package from the
board.
   The Fellheimers said yesterday's decision was made
jointly.
   "What kind of pigs would we be in letting all these good
people go and the Fellheimer family keeping two salaries?"
Mr. Fellheimer asked. "It will be the first time since we've
been together that we won't be working together, and I'm not
happy about it."
   Mrs. Fellheimer, who was one of the company's highest paid
executives with a $319,952 annual salary, said: "It just felt
wrong for both of us to stay at the company when it meant
that someone else who is loyal wouldn't be able to stay. It
just didn't have that evenhanded feel to it."
   The 47-year-old Mrs. Fellheimer, a tough, self-confident
and hard-driving executive, has served in numerous high-level
positions at Equimark. Prior to her promotion to vice
chairman of the bank's main unit, Mrs. Fellheimer, a lawyer
by training, was head of two Equimark units: Equimanagement,
which turned around several small ailing banks, and Treasure
Valley Bank in Idaho.
   The Fellheimers joined Equimark as turnaround specialists
in 1985 when federal regulators were threatening to shut down
the bank unit. Mrs. Fellheimer's high-level profile in the
company stirred controversy among some investors and analysts
who believed a husband-wife management team created a
conflict of interest. The Fellheimers always defended the
arrangement, saying that as principal shareholders in the
company no one had a greater stake in its management than
they. Together, the Fellheimers hold nearly 13% of the
company's voting stock.
   But Mr. Fellheimer acknowledged yesterday that criticism
of the husband-wife team had intensified since the recent
layoffs began. The retrenchment followed Equimark's aborted
$116 million acquisition of National Bancshares Corp. of
Texas. Equimark, which has about $3.8 billion in assets, had
built a staff assuming the National Bancshares deal would be
completed. When it fell through, the bank had to slim down.
   Mrs. Fellheimer said she'll try to find a job in
litigation or real estate. Her husband dismissed the notion
that she left the company because of any problems in their
personal lives. "Judy and I are very much in love," he said.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Equimark shares closed at $8.125, unchanged.

   BRUSSELS -- Pushed by sharp rises in Britain, Portugal and
Greece, the consumer price index for the 12 European
Community countries rose a preliminary 0.9% in April, faster
than the increases of 0.5% in March and 0.8% a year earlier,
Eurostat, the EC's statistics agency, said.
   The index for the EC as a whole, which is weighted to
reflect consumption of household goods in each EC country,
rose 5.4% in the 12 months through April, higher than the
4.7% increase in the U.S. and the 2.4% rise in Japan for the
same period. Eurostat said a 3% surge in Britain's index for
April -- the highest since 3.4% in April 1980 -- accounted
for a large part of the EC-wide increase. Greece's index rose
1.7% and Portugal's 1.2%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Britain's inflation figures for April normally reflect the
consequences of measures announced in the British budget,
Eurostat said, but this year, they were pushed up by the
introduction of the community charge, or so-called poll tax,
on adults; rises in excise duties on alcohol, tobacco, and
gasoline; and increases in public utilities, rents and
seasonal food costs.

   Canadian Pacific Plan
   For Prime Real Estate
   Possibly Stalled by City

   TORONTO -- Development of 35 acres of prime downtown land
owned by the real estate unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd. could
be delayed by the city council's order to review existing
zoning plans for the area.
   Canadian Pacific's Marathon Realty Co. said it "will
pursue whatever means are available" to uphold its rights to
develop the block of land, which is only steps from Toronto's
financial district. A move by the city to reduce the amount
of commercial development currently permitted on Marathon's
site could significantly lower the property's value.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The conflict with City Hall comes when Canadian Pacific is
due to spin off 80% of Marathon to its shareholders. Canadian
Pacific is awaiting court approval of the spinoff.
   Although Marathon officials are concerned about what they
see as a breach of faith by City Hall over planning
regulations, they downplay the effects the controversy will
have on Marathon's operations as a public concern.
   "A delay in one project doesn't fundamentally affect the
viability of the company," said John Beales, Marathon's
senior vice president, buildings.
   Marathon plans to build up to six million square feet of
office space on the site over the next 10 to 15 years. A 3/4
acre piece of land adjacent to the Marathon holding is
reported to have sold recently for more than 240 million
Canadian dollars (US$203 million). Brad Smith, analyst with
Toronto-based Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., said the 35-acre
block owned by Marathon represents about 20% of the company's
net asset value. The property is part of a 200-acre section
of a rail corridor that surrounds the central train station.

   Washington Bancorp.
   To Issue $45 Million

   WASHINGTON -- Washington Bancorp. said it plans to issue
$45 million in new secured debt to private investors to ease
the bank holding company's current liquidity crunch.
   The new debt will be secured by virtually all the assets
of the company, and the investors will receive warrants to
acquire a "major" stock interest, the amount of which is
still being negotiated. John M. Toups, chairman and chief
executive officer, said he was not pleased about the likely
dilution of the common stock, but added, "You've got to offer
something."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier this month, Washington Bancorp. said it wouldn't
be able to repay about $36.7 million of unsecured commercial
paper obligations because certain credit lines were cut off.
   While purchasers for all of the new bonds have not yet
been found, those committed to buying a portion of the notes
include Wafic Said, whose family trust and related entities
own about 27% of the company, and John J. Mason, who owns a
6.4% stake.
   After the immediate liquidity needs of the company are
met, Washington Bancorp. plans to raise additional funds by
issuing more equity, probably through a rights offering, Mr.
Toups said.
   Mr. Toups added that the company is scaling back its
operations to reduce its capital needs, particularly by
getting out of the mortgage banking and venture-capital
businesses. "We're going to stay close to home," Mr. Toups
said.

   Drexel Subsidiaries
   Seek Protection
   Under Chapter 11

   NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s brokerage
subsidiary and 14 other Drexel units filed under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, joining the parent company and
two other affiliates that previously had filed.
   Meanwhile, Drexel said that John F. Sorte, previously
co-leader of the corporate finance department, is succeeding
Frederick Joseph as chief executive officer of the brokerage
unit, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest filings put practically all of Drexel empire's
assets and liabilities under the control of the federal
bankruptcy court in Manhattan. The filing by the brokerage
unit also opens the door for creditors to more closely
scrutinize -- and possibly recover -- the $250 million in
bonuses Drexel executives received just weeks before the
parent company filed for bankruptcy-law protection. The
bonuses were paid by the brokerage unit and were off-limits
to creditors as long as the unit didn't file a bankruptcy
petition.
   "The filing in bankruptcy court will make it easier for
creditors to recover the millions in bonuses that were paid
in the dying days of the empire," said Barry Dichter, of
Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, an attorney for the central
bank of Portugal, a major Drexel creditor.
   The parent company filed under Chapter 11 on Feb. 13. At
the time, Drexel said it would liquidate all its assets and
go out of business. In the filing by the brokerage unit,
however, Drexel raised the possibility that it may emerge
from the bankruptcy proceedings as a going concern.
   A Drexel spokesman said that under a Chapter 11
reorganization plan, the company now is planning to resume
operating in at least one area of its past financial
services. Although he declined to say what areas might be
considered, he said it wouldn't be as a stock brokerage firm
or commodities broker.
   Mr. Sorte, 42 years old, also was elected a director and
senior executive vice president of the parent; Mr. Joseph
continues as president of the parent. Because Mr. Joseph has
come under much criticism for Drexel's demise, the change in
top management lends credence to talk of a Drexel revival
after the bankruptcy proceedings. "This is an indication that
they are serious about emerging as a going concern," Mr.
Dichter said.
   In its bankruptcy petition, the brokerage unit -- Drexel's
largest subsidiary -- said it had $2.1 billion in assets and
$1.09 billion in liabilities. The assets include $304 million
owed by the parent company.
   The filing said the brokerage firm's largest creditors,
excluding any claims by other Drexel entities, are Equitable
Life Assurance Society, which is owed $20.8 million; New
England Mutual Life, $18.8 million; and Citibank, a unit of
Citicorp, $13.2 million. The claims also include $1 million
owed to Paul Weiss Rifkin Wharton &amp; Garrison, the law firm
representing Mr. Milken, who recently pleaded guilty to
insider-trading related charges.
   In connection with the filing, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Howard Buschman III approved the separation of $88.7 million
in funds from the brokerage unit's other assets. The Drexel
spokesman said the funds represent the potential liability
Drexel may owe in possible claims by former customers. In its
filing, the Drexel unit said the Securities and Exchange
Commission informed the company that it wouldn't object to
the Chapter 11 filing as long as the customer funds were
separated and other requirements met.
   The filing also said that the brokerage unit and the other
subsidiaries are named as defendants in about 400 lawsuits.
The company said it wouldn't be able to resolve the mounting
litigation unless it reorganizes under Chapter 11. It said
the maturing of obligations to creditors also made the
Chapter 11 filing now necessary.

   Pic 'N' Save Corp. charged Girard Partners L.P. with
numerous violations of federal and state securities laws in
connection with Girard's attempt to gain control of Pic 'N'
Save's board.
   In a lawsuit filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, Pic 'N' Save accused Girard of making "false and
misleading statements" in certain regulatory filings, among
other violations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pic 'N' Save, based in Dominguez, Calif., seeks to block
Girard's solicitation of shareholder consents and proxies and
to prohibit Girard from purchasing additional Pic 'N' Save
shares until the allegedly false statements are corrected.
The suit also asked the court to declare that all consents
and proxies obtained so far are void.
   In La Jolla, Calif., David H. Batchelder, Girard's
controlling partner, denied the allegations. "We believe the
suit is just a tactical maneuver to try and impede our
solicitations."
   Girard, which holds a 6.7% stake in Pic 'N' Save, is
trying to install five nominees on Pic 'N' Save's
seven-member board. Pic `N' Save, a discount retailer of
close-out merchandise, recently put itself up for sale in an
apparent attempt to convince investors that the incumbent
board is more dedicated than Girard in promoting shareholder
value.

   UAL's Unions
   And Greenwald
   Are Said to Talk

   UAL Corp.'s unions have held talks with Gerald Greenwald,
vice chairman of Chrysler Corp., about taking the top job at
United Airlines if an employee buy-out succeeds, people
familiar with the situation said.
   It couldn't immediately be determined whether Mr.
Greenwald, Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca's heir apparent,
is seriously interested in any UAL union offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As recently as last week, Mr. Greenwald, 54 years old,
said through a spokesman that "there's nothing to" the rumors
that he plans to join the UAL buy-out effort.
   However, one person familiar with the situation indicated
late yesterday that talks were continuing in the union effort
to recruit Mr. Greenwald and that more meetings remained to
be held. "There are hurdles that have to be overcome," the
person said.
   Mr. Greenwald couldn't be reached yesterday. The Chrysler
spokesman said he doesn't know of any change in Mr.
Greenwald's earlier position.
   Several people familiar with the UAL buy-out effort said
the unions are close to concluding their search for a
chairman. The labor group needs to show it has a strong
candidate to succeed UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf in order to
line up bank financing for the $4.38 billion transaction
proposed in April.
   It isn't clear whether Mr. Greenwald is the unions'
leading choice. An executive search firm handling the effort
has talked with dozens of potential candidates. The unions
have ruled out many of them, and others took themselves out
of the running.
   Most of the candidates who have figured in previous
speculation about the UAL post have come from the airline
industry. But none of that industry's top executives seemed
willing to take the risk of accepting a job that may not
materialize.
   The union's new strategy, according to some people
familiar with the situation, is to recruit a chairman from
outside the airline industry who could command the respect of
the financial community. A No. 2 executive could come from
within the industry to run the airline.
   The unions are also anxious to show they are making
progress, particularly because an earlier labor-management
buy-out effort collapsed. Last week, the labor group signed
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to help in the financing effort. The
group has until Aug. 9 to arrange financing under an
agreement with the board of Chicago-based UAL.
   Union officials believe Mr. Greenwald would lend
considerable weight to the employee effort. During the early
1980s, Mr. Greenwald, who joined Chrysler from Ford Motor Co.
in 1979, was one of the main architects of Chrysler's
recovery from near bankruptcy.
   The timing of the rumors about Mr. Greenwald is
unfortunate for Highland Park, Mich-based Chrysler, however.
Two weeks ago, the No. 3 U.S. auto maker's vice president of
international operations resigned to take a top job at Black
&amp; Decker Corp. Last week, the company confirmed that its
treasurer plans to leave. One top Chrysler executive said
yesterday that these departures are "an unfortunate
coincidence of individual decisions."
   In 1988, Mr. Greenwald was named vice chairman and a
member with Mr. Iacocca, of the Office of the Chairman. At
the time, Chrysler said the move "paves the way for an
orderly succession" when Mr. Iacocca retires.
   But the date of Mr. Iacocca's retirement is uncertain,
which is perhaps why Mr. Greenwald at least listened to the
approach from UAL unions. In 1987, Mr. Iacocca signed a
contract with Chrysler that expires at the end of 1991. But
at recent appearances in Chicago and Los Angeles, Mr.
Iacocca, who is 65 years old, has said he hasn't made up his
mind yet exactly when he will leave.

   Mediq Inc., a New Jersey hospital equipment supplier, sued
Kinetic Concepts Inc., claiming that Kinetic obtained
confidential information about Mediq during negotiations for
a proposed buy-out, and then bought a competing supplier
instead.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia,
asks the court to halt Kinetic's acquisition of Salt Lake
City, Utah-based Medirec and to enjoin Kinetic from using any
Mediq confidential information. It also asks for unspecified
damages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kinetic, a specialized bed manufacturing and rental
concern, agreed earlier this month to buy Medirec for about
$26 million in cash and $10 million of preferred stock, which
is convertible into common at $10 a share. Medirec, a
privately held medical equipment rental concern, competes
with Mediq/PRN Life Support Services of Pennsauken, N.J., a
health-care services and equipment manufacturing and leasing
unit of Mediq.
   Mediq claims that during buy-out talks with Kinetic, it
disclosed confidential information including marketing
methods, cost and pricing information and bidding strategies.
Kinetic abruptly terminated the buy-out talks in April, and
three weeks later disclosed its purchase of Medirec. Mediq
claims Kinetic's possession of the information puts Mediq/PRN
at a disadvantage.
   Spokesmen for Kinetic and Medirec denied Mediq's charges.

   Aetna Delays Exit
   From Car Policies
   In Pennsylvania

   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. said it temporarily halted its
withdrawal from Pennsylvania's automobile insurance market
and agreed to rescind the 9,000 non-renewal notices it had
already sent to policyholders in the state.
   State regulators acknowledge that the Hartford, Conn.,
company, the fifth-largest insurer working in Pennsylvania,
has complied with the state's new auto insurance law by
submitting a rate filing that provides premium rollbacks of
10% and up to 22% for policyholders who choose a limited tort
option.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, the company has resubmitted a filing for
relief from these rollbacks under an "extraordinary
circumstances" clause in the new law, which was enacted in
February.
   Aetna submitted the rate-relief filing in April, but it
was returned without any action by state insurance
regulators. The insurance department has promised to rule on
Aetna's rate-relief filing in 10 working days. Aetna has
200,000 automobile policyholders in Pennsylvania.
   However, Aetna and the state haven't yet dropped their
respective lawsuits against each other. Aetna is one of seven
insurers being sued by the state to force compliance with the
new law. The state was also seeking a temporary injunction
against the company because Aetna had ignored an order from
the insurance department to stop sending out the non-renewal
notices.
   Aetna has challenged the constitutionality of the new law
and asked a federal court to enjoin the Pennsylvania
insurance commissioner from taking any action to block its
exit from the state's auto insurance market.
   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey is still maintaining a
tough stance in making insurers comply with the new law. "I
don't believe insurers have a universal right to pick up and
leave after doing business here for so many years and
throwing their policyholders to the wolves. That's not good
policy," he said at a news conference last week. Yet, he also
is willing to negotiate.
   Last week, Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. reached a
similar pact with Pennsylvania officials, agreeing to
continue to provide auto insurance for its 65,000
policyholders in this state. The insurance department was
expected to rule on its rate filing today.
   As part of their agreement, Harleysville and the state
dropped their lawsuits against each other.
   The insurance department already has ruled on seven
rate-relief filings, exempting Keystone Insurance Co. and
Colonial Penn Insurance Co. from the mandatory 10% and 22%
rate rollbacks. The state is requiring smaller rollbacks in
most instances from these two companies. The state based its
decision on an assumption that each company would be earning
a 12% return on its surplus capital.
   Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., one of the five companies
whose rate-relief filing wasn't granted, yesterday filed an
appeal with a state court, asking for a formal hearing to
review the insurance department's ruling. Nationwide, which
insures 800,000 drivers in Pennsylvania, claims the rollbacks
required by the new law would provide rates that would be too
low to pay claims and cover its operating costs in the state.
   Nationwide also will continue to pursue a lawsuit it had
previously filed in federal court, seeking a preliminary
injunction against the state to block key portions of the new
insurance law from going into effect.

   WPPSS's Legacy:
   Premium Yields
   Still a Fact of Life

<GV>
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)
</GV>
<LP>
   The credit-rating agencies that are cracking down on banks
and overleveraged companies are boosting ratings on bonds
issued by the biggest defaulter in the municipal market.
   These ratings boosts -- by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
yesterday and by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. last week -- come
just as Washington Public Power Supply System prepares to
sell $600 million of bonds next week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But even with the higher ratings, market analysts said
WPPSS's offering of bonds maturing in two to 27 years will
require premium yields to attract investors. That is because
WPPSS, known on Wall Street as "Whoops," still bears the
black eye of defaulting on $2.25 billion of bonds in 1983.
And the onus persists even though the bonds WPPSS is selling
with the higher ratings are for power plants for which there
wasn't any default.
   While WPPSS bonds have been well-received by institutions,
individual investors still shy away from the name. "The
average guy on the street still doesn't want to own {WPPSS}
bonds," said Bruce Whiteford, a vice president and manager of
the fixed-income department of Chase Manhattan Bank's U.S.
Private Banking Group.
   Prices of WPPSS bonds didn't move yesterday in reaction to
the ratings news because of the impending offering, which
adds still more new supply to the marketplace. WPPSS, a
quasi-government agency that supplies electricity in the
state of Washington, sold $721 million of bonds last
September.
   That offering was the first time WPPSS raised money in the
public debt market since its default on nuclear units 4 and 5
bonds. The September sale consisted of refunding bonds for
nuclear units 1 and 3. Premium interest rates offered on the
refunding securities resulted in strong demand at the time.
   Moody's said it upgraded to double-A from single-A about
$6.32 billion of revenue bonds related to WPPSS's nuclear
plants 1, 2 and 3. The new double-A rating also applies to
the $600 million of refunding revenue bonds for nuclear units
2 and 3, scheduled to be sold next week through a group lead
by First Boston Corp.
   Also boosted to double-A from single-A was $26 million of
miscellaneous securities of WPPSS -- $17 million issued for
the Hanford Generating Project, and $9 million issued for the
Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project.
   Bonds related to WPPSS's nuclear units 1, 2 and 3 are
guaranteed by Bonneville Power Administration and weren't
part of the 1983 default, the biggest municipal default ever.
   Moody's said its upgrade reflects "continued strong
performance at Bonneville Power Administration," the
federally created agency left to pick up some of the pieces
from WPPSS's giant miscalculation of the need for nuclear
power in the Pacific Northwest.
   Moody's noted that Bonneville's "role is a critical
ratings consideration, given the fact that it operates in a
region where public power issues have a long history of being
particularly volatile and political." The ratings company
said Bonneville has demonstrated a "capacity and willingness
to establish itself institutionally as a competitive,
self-supporting enterprise, with sound resource-planning
policies."
   Last week, Standard &amp; Poor's raised the rating on WPPSS's
revenue bonds for nuclear units 1, 2 and 3 and related
securities to double-A from double-A-minus, citing similar
conclusions as Moody's.

   Hasbro Inc., Pawtucket, R.I., said in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing that it no longer has voting
control over Time Warner Inc.'s 10 million-share stake in the
company. But Hasbro said it continues to retain rights of
first refusal to buy the shares until 1993, if Time Warner
wants to sell them.
   The filing said a May 1983, shareholder rights agreement
with Warner Communications expired, as expected. The
agreement had given Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman, and Barry
Alperin, co-chief operating officer, voting control over the
Time Warner unit's 17.4% stake.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said the change in voting control would probably
have little effect on Hasbro. "Hasbro is in excellent
financial shape and has the resources to buy these shares
back if it wants to," said Paul Valentine, an analyst with
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. He added that "there's no indication
that Alan Hassenfeld wants to give up control of the
company."
   A Time Warner spokesman said the company would have no
comment on whether it has any plans to dispose of its Hasbro
stake.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- A class-action shareholder
lawsuit was filed against Adobe Systems Inc. in federal
court, alleging violations of federal securities laws.
   The suit was prompted by the software company's disclosure
last Thursday that earnings and revenue for the second
quarter would be much lower than expected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Adobe had blamed the revised figures on a 23% decline in
the company's sales to customer Apple Computer Inc. But Apple
disputed the claim and issued a counter news release a day
later, asserting that the sales decline was far less.
   The suit, filed by investor Richard Clotier in U.S.
District Court in Northern California, charges Adobe with
failure to disclose information and insider trading. On the
insider trading count, the suit names Adobe's chief executive
officer, John Warnock, Charles Geschke, its president, and
Bruce Nakaw, chief financial officer.
   An Adobe spokeswoman called the lawsuit "completely
without merit" and said the software maker intends to contest
it. She added that the company "would not be surprised" if
several other shareholder suits were filed shortly.
   Following disclosure of the revised forecast, Adobe's
stock plunged $15.25, or about 30%, to $35.25 a share on
Friday. The revised estimate predicted earnings of 29 cents
to 37 cents a share, on revenue of $33 million to $36
million. This report was well below analyst estimates for net
of 51 cents a share and revenue of about $42 million.
   Adobe insiders sold 501,153 shares from Jan. 1 to April
30, compared with 293,032 shares in all of 1989, according to
Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., firm that tracks insider
buying and selling. In April, 90,000 shares were sold by Mr.
Warnock at between $37.75 and $38.25, and 40,000 were sold by
Mr. Geschke at between $39 and $40 each.
   The company spokeswoman said "there was nothing
extraordinary" about the sales. "They were all consistent"
with the executives' sales in previous years, she said.

   The federal anti-cartel office informed MAN, an
engineering concern, that it can't approve the acquisition in
its current form, MAN said. MAN and Daimler have until next
Wednesday to respond to the objections. The agency is
expected to make its final ruling by July 15. A denial may be
appealed to the economics minister.

   The antitrust agency declined to comment, noting that the
investigation isn't complete. People in the industry said the
agency objects to the cooperation of MAN and Daimler, the two
main West German truck makers; MAN agreed to acquire 60% of
Enasa and Daimler-Benz 20%, with 20% to remain in Spain's
state industrial holding company, Instituto Nacional de
Industria, which also is to acquire an 8% interest in MAN.
MAN would gain control of the heavy-truck lines and Daimler
the light-truck plant, but they want to exercise joint
managerial control and take responsibility for all of Enasa.

   Molex's Shareholders
   Approve the Creation
   Of New Class of Stock

   LISLE, Ill. -- Molex Inc. said shareholders approved the
creation of a new class of nonvoting common stock, allowing
the company to issue new shares without diluting the voting
interest of existing stockholders.
   The maker of electrical and electronic equipment has about
24.9 million voting common shares outstanding -- about 47% in
the hands of the founding Krehbiel family -- and 94,255
shares of a separate Class B common stock, held only by the
Krehbiels. The Class B common votes separately.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Following the shareholder vote, the company declared a
special dividend of one share of Class A nonvoting stock for
each common and Class B share, payable July 25 to stock of
record June 29. The voting and nonvoting shares will trade
separately, the company said.
   The plan means that holders, after the distribution, could
sell up to half their holdings and still retain their
original voting power. The move will "facilitate the Krehbiel
family's continued ownership of a substantial portion of the
company's voting stock," Molex said, and permit the company
to be managed "based on long-term objectives."
   In the event a party other than the Krehbiel family
acquires more than 50% of the voting common stock, all the
nonvoting shares automatically convert into voting shares.
Such a provision is aimed at ensuring that Class A holders
receive equal treatment in the event of any takeover, said an
official.
   Shareholders also authorized the company to issue up to
$25 million of a new class of "blank check" preferred stock;
the board has discretion to issue the stock under different
terms and conditions. Molex said it hasn't any current plans
to issue the new preferred.
   In addition, stockholders voted to approve certain "fair
price" measures designed to ensure that shareholders are
treated equally in the event of a takeover attempt, although
the company said it isn't aware of any current takeover
efforts.
   Molex boosted its quarterly dividend to one cent a share
from 0.8 cent, payable July 25 to stock of record June 29.
After the distribution of the nonvoting shares, the quarterly
payout will be one-half cent for all shares.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Molex closed at
$46.50, unchanged.

   Acton Corp., Raleigh, N.C., said it preliminarily agreed
to buy the furniture operations of High Point, N.C.-based
Hickory Furniture Co., a unit of closely held Telco Capital
Corp., Chicago, for $44.5 million.
   Acton is engaged in specialized auto insurance
underwriting, real estate development and the operation of a
cable-television system. Hickory, which has seven production
facilities in North Carolina, beneficially owns about 40% of
the common stock of Acton and controls about 76% of the
voting power of Acton's voting stock.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The companies said the transaction was negotiated by
independent special committees of the Acton and Hickory
boards, each having their own counsel and outside advisers.
The transaction is subject, among other things, to a
definitive purchase agreement and the receipt by Acton's
special committee of an opinion from its investment adviser
that the price to be paid is fair to Acton shareholders,
other than Hickory. The deal is expected to close within the
next two weeks.

   To Back Drug Test
   For Cystic Fibrosis

   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO -- Genentech Inc. said it asked the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve a human clinical
test of a potential new drug against cystic fibrosis.
   Cystic fibrosis, a hereditary disease that affects one in
every 2,500 babies born in the U.S., is marked by thick lung
secretions that often lead to respiratory failure and death
by age 28. Currently, there are an estimated 30,000 young
people with the disease in this country.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The experimental treatment is based upon a concept that
has been around since the 1950s. Decades ago, scientists
found that a certain cow enzyme could dissolve excess amounts
of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the lung secretions, making
them more liquid and easier to clear from the breathing
passages. But the cow enzyme provoked allergic reactions, and
never became standard treatment.
   The biotech firm said its scientists used gene-splicing
technology to insert the gene for the human form of this
enzyme into mammalian cells. The cells produce a purified
form of the human enzyme, called DNase. Genentech said few
allergic reactions are expected because the engineered enzyme
mimics the natural form already found in the human body.
   Genentech said it hopes to test DNase in an aerosolized
form in young adults with cystic fibrosis. After determining
its safety and appropriate dose levels, the company plans to
launch studies in younger children.
   If shown to be useful against cystic fibrosis, the drug
may be tested against other lung ailments, such as bacterial
pneumonia, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, Genentech added.

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government decided to extend a 500
million Canadian dollar (US$423.7 million) credit line to the
Soviet Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs (Vnesheconombank) to
assist the export of Canadian goods and services to the
Soviet Union.
   The decision was announced yesterday, the first day of a
two-day Canadian visit by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
The Soviet leader is to fly to Washington later today for a
five-day U.S. visit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two-year credit line will be "a major asset to develop
trade with the Soviet Union," said Canadian Trade Minister
John Crosbie. It will be provided by a Canadian government
export financing agency, the Export Development Corp.
   The corporation will provide financing for as much as 85%
of the value of Canadian goods and services sold to Soviet
customers. Repayment will be made over periods ranging from
three to 8 1/2 years at fixed or floating interest rates.
   A Canadian trade official said the credit line will
replace a less-flexible supplier credit protocol with the
Soviet Union.
   Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski also disclosed that
Canada and the Soviet Union have held preliminary talks on
the renewal of a grain sales agreement. The existing
five-year agreement, which expires July 31, 1991, calls for
the Soviet Union to buy at least 25 million metric tons of
Canadian wheat and feed grains during the period of the
agreement.

   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms remained largely unchanged in the
week ended yesterday.
   Changes in average yields were mixed for
small-denomination CDs, while they remained at or above 8%
for maturities of six months and longer. The average yield on
a one-year consumer CD eased to 8% from 8.02%, while yields
on two-year consumer CDs were up to 8.12% from 8.10%,
according to figures compiled by Banxquote Money Markets, a
New York information service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   None of the banks in Banxquote's 18-bank survey offered a
yield as high as 9%. The highest yield for a
small-denomination consumer CD was 8.76% for a five-year CD
offered by Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.
   Small-denomination CDs sold by leading broker-dealers were
also little-changed, with average yields remaining above 8%
for all maturities. Average yields on six-month CDs eased to
8.30% from 8.32%, while average yields on five-year CDs
remained at 8.63%.
   Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
down slightly for all maturities. Average yields on six-month
jumbo CDs slid to 7.89% from 7.91%, while one-year maturities
fell to 8.06% from 8.11%.

   Tyco Labs to Buy
   Operating Assets
   Of Australia Firm

   In a big push into Europe and the Pacific Rim, Tyco
Laboratories Inc. said it will buy the operating assets of an
Australian maker of fire-protection equipment for about $600
million in cash and stock.
   Tyco, which has a commanding share of the fast-growing
fire-protection market, said it will pay $350 million in cash
and five million shares of common stock for Wormald
International Ltd. The stock, valued at $242 million at
current prices, will represent 10.6% of shares outstanding
after closing the deal, a Tyco statement said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, Irving Gutin, senior vice president, said Tyco
will report revenue of $2.1 billion for the fiscal year
ending Thursday, up from $1.97 billion in 1989. Mr. Gutin
also forecast revenue of $3.45 billion for the next fiscal
year, reflecting the Wormald acquisition.
   Investors reacted positively. In active New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, Tyco closed at $50.75 a share, up
$2.50.
   "This clearly gives Tyco the No. 1 position in the world
as a fire-control provider," said Laurence C. Baker, an
analyst with Dillon, Read &amp; Co. Based on Tyco's history with
acquisitions, the deal probably will be non-dilutive of its
stock, he said. But he added: "The question is what happens
in the short term, and we don't have enough information yet
to tell."
   The Wormald acquisition gives Tyco a strong presence in
Europe and the United Kingdom, where fiscal 1991 sales should
rise to $600 million from approximately $35 million before
the acquisition, Tyco said. In Pacific Rim nations, Tyco
projects a sales increase to $340 million from $15 million
before the acquisition. Wormald's fiscal-1991 sales in the
U.S. and Canada are projected to rise to about $210 million.
   Fire protection-making and installing sprinklers, alarms
and industrial fire-suppression systems -- is Tyco's largest
business, accounting for $1.7 billion of the projected 1991
sales of $3.45 billion. Industrial flow-control system sales
are forecast at $900 million, with electronics and packaging
accounting for the rest.
   L. Dennis Kozlowski, president and chief operating officer
and president of Tyco's Grinnell Corp. fire-protection unit,
said the fire-detection market "has grown dramatically in the
U.S. and Canada" as laws require such systems in public
buildings. He projected increased profitability as a result
of the acquisition.
   Under terms of the Wormald agreement, Tyco also will issue
a five-year warrant to buy five million additional Tyco
shares, at $70 each. Tyco said the firms agreed to appoint
representatives to their respective boards and will enter an
agreement whereby Wormald may not acquire additional shares
except under specified circumstances. Tyco also said
completion of the transaction is subject to government
approvals and a vote by Wormald shareholders.

   CANTON, Ohio -- Timken Co. purchased MPB Corp. for $185
million, moving the big maker of tapered roller bearings and
specialty steels into the precision aircraft bearings market.
   MPB, which has annual sales of more than $120 million and
employs 1,850 people at plants in Keene and Lebanon, N.H., is
a major supplier of ball and roller bearings for aircraft
engines and aircraft and missile control systems. Its
bearings also are used in computer disk drives, X-ray
equipment and other precision instruments, but aircraft is
the major market, Timken said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Timken's bearings are used in automobiles, trucks,
industrial machinery and other equipment, but the company
hasn't previously participated in the precision bearings
business, said Joseph F. Toot Jr., president. He said Timken
is aware that a defense spending cutback may cut into MPB's
business, but he said strong commercial aircraft sales and
increased applications in other precision equipment will
offset any loss of defense business.
   Timken bought MPB for cash, and the price included the
cost of retiring the concern's debt, Mr. Toot said. He said
the acquisition won't dilute Timken's earnings.
   There are no plans to move any of the MPB operations nor
to change the company's management, said Peter J. Ashton,
Timken executive vice president, bearings. Thomas Uhlig is
president and chief executive officer of MPB, Mr. Ashton
said.

   Auto Workers Union

   TORONTO -- The Canadian Auto Workers union will make
higher wages its top demand in this summer's contract
negotiations with the Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three
auto makers, Robert White, CAW president, said.
   The Canadian union's bargaining plank contrasts with that
of the United Auto Workers in the U.S., which last week said
it would demand practically unconditional job security in its
contract talks. Both unions' contracts with General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and their Canadian
units are due to expire Sept. 14.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. White, speaking at the opening of the CAW's convention
to set bargaining goals, said the union, which represents
65,000 auto workers in Canada, also will seek improvements in
cost-of-living adjustments and income maintenance schemes for
laid-off workers. Job security, which Mr. White said
ultimately cannot be guaranteed, will be addressed indirectly
through such demands as reduced work hours.
   "We shouldn't fool our members. If (auto) sales drop off .
. . I don't know how you can get job security," Mr. White
said. The CAW official said he doesn't mean to criticize the
UAW's demanding job security, but said "philosophical"
differences continued to divide the two unions. The CAW split
from its U.S. counterpart in 1985.
   The CAW also won't be pressing for greater worker
involvement in corporate decisions, one of the main demands
that will be made by the U.S. union. In a policy document,
the CAW says management-worker team concepts often are used
by management "to replace worker solidarity with total
identification with the goals of the company."
   In 1987, the CAW concluded contract agreements, which for
the first time included an inflation-pegged indexing system
for pensioners, after a six-day strike at Chrysler's Canadian
subsidiary.

   Stake to Be Bought

   BRUSSELS -- In an attempt to get a bigger piece of the
booming global express-parcel business, Lufthansa, Japan Air
Lines and Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai Corp. agreed
as expected to buy minority stakes in DHL International Ltd.,
the world's largest air-courier company.
   Patrick Lupo, chief executive officer of DHL
International, said the three partners also are negotiating
to purchase small stakes in DHL Corp., the U.S. arm of the
closely held company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the agreement, the three companies will buy
equal shares in DHL International, a Hong Kong holding
company run out of Brussels, and Middlestown N.V., a holding
company in Netherlands Antilles. Mr. Lupo said the two
vehicles together control all DHL's international operations,
which have annual revenue of $1.3 billion.
   Initially, Lufthansa and JAL will buy 5% of the stock of
both companies, while Nissho Iwai will take 2.5%. But the
three have options to boost their stakes during the next 18
months. The two airlines can increase their stakes to 25%
each and Nissho Iwai can buy as much as 7.5%.
   In Tokyo, JAL said this total equity stake of 57.5%
represents an investment of about $500 million. DHL and
Lufthansa declined to comment on the figure.
   The deal is subject to various government approvals.
   Mr. Lupo said DHL Corp., the U.S. operation, has revenue
of approximately $500 million a year. He said he believed the
three partners would buy stakes smaller than those they will
take in the international DHL. In any case, U.S. law would
limit foreign investment in DHL Corp. to a total of 25% of
the shares.
   Founded in 1969 by three U.S. entrepreneurs, DHL has grown
to become the world's largest international courier service.
DHL serves 184 countries and carried more than 50 million
shipments in 1989.
   In recent years, the company has faced intense competition
from Federal Express Co. of Memphis, Tenn., United Parcel
Service of America Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., and TNT Ltd. of
Australia. The capital infusion from Lufthansa, JAL and
Nissho Iwai will help DHL keep its competitive edge, analysts
said.
   The new investors also could ease the pressure on DHL to
become a major international air carrier, said Cotton Daly,
director of cargo services of New York consultants Simat,
Helliesen &amp; Eichner Inc. DHL uses its own planes to fly
packages within the U.S. and within Europe, but uses other
airlines to carry its shipments long distances.
   DHL's Mr. Lupo said JAL and Lufthansa together carry less
than 20% of DHL's international shipments. He said the
company intends to continue placing its international
shipments on many airlines, based on price and scheduling.
   For JAL and Lufthansa, the DHL tie-up is a way to gain
easy access to an extensive world-wide distribution network.
For Nissho Iwai, which has vast experience in shipping large
volumes of goods, the deal is a way to gain experience in
small aircargo shipments.

   The World Bank in Washington approved a $300 million loan
to China to help finance long-term forestry development
projects, but it delayed action on two other credits,
totaling $150 million, for transportation projects.
   The bank's executive directors also cleared $402 million
in loans to Mexico to support economic reforms in the
trucking industry and other sectors of its economy. Part of
the money also will be used for telecommunications projects.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The loan to China will finance treeplanting. It will be
provided by the International Development Association, a
World Bank affiliate.
   A Treasury spokesman said the U.S. supported the loan
because it meets basic human needs. He said the credit will
help China overcome a serious shortage of wood needed for the
construction of houses and for cooking and heating in rural
areas. The forestry projects also will generate part-time and
seasonal employment for workers in poor rural areas, he
added.
   The U.S., voicing concern about China's repression of
pro-democracy groups, opposed the two transportation-sector
loans.

   Surprising Surge in U.S. Gasoline Futures Prices
   Carries Over Into World-Wide Petroleum Market

   A surprising surge in U.S. gasoline futures lifted
petroleum prices world-wide.
   The sizzling rally in late trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange drove unleaded gasoline for June delivery
2.38 cents a gallon higher. It settled at 65.79 cents.

<TEXT>
   Pricing volatility had been expected for the June gasoline
contract this week because Thursday is its last day of
trading. But July gasoline also was up by nearly the two-cent
limit. It settled at 62.96 cents a gallon, a gain of 1.96
cents.
   "People are saying we could have a tight gasoline market
and that {the futures price} could get up to 70 cents again,"
said John Hill, a Merrill Lynch vice president.
   The gasoline rally helped pull up other petroleum prices.
In U.S. futures trading, the New York Mercantile Exchange
crude for July delivery was up 18 cents to $17.98 a barrel at
the close.
   Before rebounding, the July crude had fallen to $17.45 a
barrel, which traders later cited as a technical support
point. The August crude contract rose six cents to $18.58 a
barrel.
   Before trading began yesterday in the U.S., oil prices
appeared to be headed down. In European markets, spot prices
of North Sea crudes dropped between 40 cents and 50 cents a
barrel, according to the Dow Jones International Petroleum
Report.
   But later the New York Merc rally developed and spread to
London's International Petroleum Exchange, which has long
trading hours. On the IPE, Brent-blend crude futures closed
eight cents to 23 cents a barrel higher.
   There was news concerning the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries that may have helped turn around the weak
oil market. Oil production in Gabon, an OPEC member, has been
hurt because of the civil unrest there. From Baghdad, where
the Arab summit meeting is being held, the oil ministers of
Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates issued a new
call for OPEC members to abide by production quotas. That
followed yesterday's report in this newspaper that monitors
of OPEC output expect to report May production down by as as
much as 500,000 barrels a day.
   There still is a huge surplus of crude oil overhanging
world petroleum markets, however. And by now, gasoline prices
usually have begun to firm, because this is what the oil
industry calls the driving season, which traditionally begins
with the Memorial Day weekend. Still, demand for gasoline has
been essentially flat.
   But oil-market participants apparently are looking at
supplies rather than demand. "We are coming into the
high-demand season some 10 million barrels under a year ago
{in gasoline inventories} and with low production," said Joe
Bongiorno, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   He and others cited the relatively low operating rates of
U.S. refineries and the fact that many of them are in
prolonged shutdowns for maintenance. As a result, the next of
the industry's weekly reports on U.S. oil statistics, to be
released today, is generally expected to show another
drawdown in gasoline inventories. As of May 18, gasoline
inventories totaled 213.2 million barrels, down from 221.3
million a year earlier.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Due to heavy rains in recent weeks,
nearly 27% of the U.S. soybean crop is in the ground,
compared with 53% last year, according to an Agriculture
Department report released after the close of futures trading
yesterday. The U.S. corn crop is 81% planted, compared with
83% last year, which is roughly what many analysts had
expected. All figures were for the week ended last Sunday.
The 27% soybean planting figure was below many analysts'
estimates of 30% to 40% planted, but isn't likely to send
soybean futures prices soaring today. That's because weather
forecasts updated at noon yesterday called for much less rain
this week across many growing areas than had been earlier
predicted. "We only need three to four sunny days to play
catch-up in soybeans," one analyst said. Also weighing on
soybean futures prices was an increase in soybean sales by
Brazilian farmers, whose product was made cheaper on
international markets because of a currency devaluation by
the Brazilian government, U.S. futures analysts said. Soybean
futures for July delivery dropped 13 cents a bushel to close
at $6.06. July corn futures gained 0.25 cent a bushel to
close at $2.8425.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Most pork belly futures contracts
closed up the daily price limit of two cents a pound on
mounting concerns that warehouse supplies of frozen pork
bellies are at low levels relative to the traditional summer
increase in demand for bacon. An industry report released
late Friday showed that only five million pounds of pork
bellies were added to storage in April, compared with an
expected increase of as much as 12 million pounds, said
Charles Levitt, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in Chicago. As of May 1 there were 102.2 million pounds
of bellies in storage, he said. That figure is larger than
the 10-year average for bellies in storage on May 1, but
substantially less than last year's 143.8 million pounds in
storage. Movement of bellies into cold storage so far this
month has totaled about one million pounds, compared to a
10-year average of about seven million pounds of pork bellies
stored in May, Mr. Levitt said. Pork belly futures for July
delivery closed up two cents a pound at 67.85 cents on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices fell. The July contract opened near
its day's high at 14.63 cents a pound and steadily weakened
to as low as 13.90 cents before settling at 14.03 cents, off
0.66 cent from Friday's close. The market was responding to a
new F.O. Licht report that contained two pieces of bearish
news: Estimated production in the season ending Aug. 30 was
revised upward to 108.55 million metric tons from a previous
estimate of 107.91 million metric tons; consumption was
revised down to 107.86 million metric tons from 108.07
million previously. Judith Ganes, commodity analyst at
Merrill Lynch in New York, said the market was given a shock
of reality when it saw the net result of these estimate
changes switch from a 157,000-ton production deficit to a
690,000-ton surplus. "Though the market knew bearish figures
were probably on the way, seeing them in print was somewhat
of a shock," she said. The market was hit by selling through
brokerage firms -- which is how individual investors trade --
by commodity funds and by professional floor traders known as
"locals." There could be some additional follow-through
selling, Ms. Ganes noted, as calls go out for investors to
put up more money to maintain their positions. Even with the
revised estimates, Ms. Ganes said supply and demand are still
in close balance and that the market could rally on very
little news. Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at
PaineWebber in New York, said the July contract fell below an
important support level at 14.08 cents. He said that the most
recent Licht report clearly represents an important change in
market fundamentals. "The market was looking for a fifth
consecutive season in which consumption exceeded production,
and it now realizes that it is not going to get it," Mr.
Savaiko said. He also noted that people in the sugar industry
generally believed a surplus wouldn't materialize until the
1990-91 season.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Prices of soonest-maturing futures contracts rose,
with July jumping two cents, the daily price-move limit, to
82.03 cents a pound. Other delivery months were up less or
even fell. According to Thomas Mueller, senior cotton analyst
at Merrill Lynch in New York, the limited strength was
apparently due to a very small stock of certified cotton
available for delivery against the July contract. He noted
that only 49,366 bales are now available for delivery, and
that 3,868 of those bales are likely to be decertified. He
estimates that the number of July contracts outstanding is
equivalent to more than 1.7 million bales. However, Mr.
Mueller said he doesn't believe that a squeeze would actually
occur in the July contract, because he thinks the holders of
long positions will abandon them before the delivery period
starts on June 25. "Most traders should be out of the July
contract long before June 25; the July contract is just too
volatile," said Mr. Mueller. He also said that many traders
were executing a strategy in which they bought July or
October contracts and sold December, causing its price to
decline. He added that the volume of trading was estimated at
an unimpressive 7,000 contracts. Mr. Mueller said: "It will
be difficult to sustain prices above 82 cents -- a
psychologically important area."

   Your April 23 Advertising column on Seagram's development
of Mount Royal Light, a 54-proof whiskey, requires comment.
   Seagram is not yet "beginning a national rollout" of this
new product. Mount Royal Light, which has been in two test
markets in the Northeast since last September with some
success, is adding three more test markets, in Southern,
Midwestern and Western states. The operative word is "test"
and will remain so for the time being.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   You are also wrong, as is the beverage consultant Tom
Pirko, in stating the consumer can already control the amount
of alcohol in a drink by merely adding mixer or water. The
typical serving portion of about an ounce and a half of
80-proof liquor contains a half-ounce of alcohol. That
half-ounce of alcohol remains in the drink, whether the drink
is taken neat, on the rocks or topped off with water, soda or
fruit juice. Dilution will alter the taste and make a bigger
drink, but it can't and won't reduce the quantity of alcohol
(or calories either, for that matter).
   By contrast, the unique process by which Mount Royal Light
is produced does reduce by one-third the amount of alcohol
(and calories) in the serving, but it does not dilute the
whiskey or weaken the taste and body of the product. You
can't do that at home.
   Our extensive research indicates a strong consumer
interest in a lower-proof, thus "lighter," spirits product.
If Mount Royal Light continues the test well, the Nobel Prize
may well elude us, as Mr. Pirko predicts, but so far
consumers and distributors, whom you and Mr. Pirko apparently
neglected to canvas, are telling us we have developed a very
promising product.

   First Thanksgiving
   Was April 30, 1598

   It was interesting to read "Texas Receives a Counter
Offer: It Can Have the Salem Witch Trials" (April 30).
Interesting, because on April 28 a few members of the
Hispanic Family History Researchers based in Orange County,
Calif., presented a dramatic re-enactment of "Thanksgiving
1598." Eight members of the cast are descendants of those
original Onate colonizers, with some of us playing the parts
of our 13th-great-grandparents.
   As a native of New Mexico, I have done considerable family
research in tracing my roots back four centuries in America.
Through my research, I learned about the first Thanksgiving.
Mimi Lozano-Holtzman wrote the script for "Thanksgiving
1598," and with the cast in full costume we entertained the
audience with the "first act of Thanksgiving recorded in the
continental United States by Europeans."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The spokesman whom you quote is correct in saying "The
Pilgrims were never there," but could have elaborated and
said that they were still in England being persecuted for
their religious beliefs. In 1608 they fled to Holland, and it
would be an additional 12 years before they could get passage
to the East Coast of this continent.
   I agree, we don't have a Plymouth Rock in New Mexico, but
we have a Mount Robledo, and it was in the shadow of this
peak that my 13th-great-grandfather is buried. His name was
Pedro Robledo, born in Maqueda, Spain, in 1539.
   With the Quintcentennial around the corner, it is my wish
that the many contributions of the Spanish finally will be
manifested, and I for one will be delighted to celebrate the
first Thanksgiving on April 30 and the second one in
November.

   PARIS -- Cie. Generale d'Electricite's unfriendly effort
to control Framatome S.A., France's large builder of nuclear
power plants, may be fading.
   Credit Lyonnais, a large state-owned bank allied with
Framatome management, announced that it has begun an effort
to restructure Framatome's shareholding. Government and
business officials here say the effort has the Finance
Ministry's backing, and is aimed at keeping Framatome
independent of CGE. Credit Lyonnais said CGE's departure from
Framatome is just one working hypothesis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CGE, an electric-equipment company, specializes in
telephone equipment, high-speed trains and electric power
equipment. In that last capacity, it works closely with
Framatome, and CGE long has viewed Framatome as a logical
subsidiary.
   CGE, in a surprise announcement, said it is prepared to
discuss all proposals, including the sale of its current 40%
Framatome stake. Government sources say CGE Chairman Pierre
Suard is expected to meet with Finance Minister Pierre
Beregovoy to discuss possible terms for CGE to sell some or
all of its stake to Credit Lyonnais.
   Various government and business officials stressed that a
solution hasn't yet been reached. But if CGE were to sell, it
would reflect a defeat for the huge company, which for years
has sought to control Framatome.

   One Investor Hunts for Values in Battered Bond Funds

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
</IN>
<LP>
   Hungry for fees, Wall Street brought out so many new
publicly traded bond funds that prices plunged. But now that
the bond funds are in the cellar, the smart money is moving
in to buy.
   Among the buyers is Ronald Olin of Houston's Deep Discount
Advisors. Usually, he keeps most of his clients' money in
stock funds. But in recent months he has switched one-third
of it into bond funds. Mr. Olin is one of the few money
managers specializing solely in publicly traded, or
"closed-end," funds, a type that has mushroomed to a $50
billion market even while disappointing many small investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Olin makes money from others' misery, waiting
patiently for funds to lose their luster and then scooping
them up at rock bottom prices. He is able to play this game
because closed-end funds -- so called because they are closed
to new investors after their initial offerings -- can trade
in the market at prices that differ widely from the market
value of the securities they own.
   There are certainly plenty of bond funds to choose from.
At the start of 1988, there were just 46 of these publicly
traded bond funds. In the past two years, 88 new bond funds
have been sold to investors. "After the crash, that was one
of the few products that could be sold to a shell-shocked
public," recalls Mr. Olin. "They brought out gobs and gobs of
these bond funds."
   Unlike regular mutual funds, the closed-end funds make
only one offering of shares, which then trade on an exchange
like any other stock. The shares are sold to small investors
at what amounts to a 7.5% premium to the value of the
underlying portfolio. That's because of the brokerage
commissions charged on a new closed-end. For every $1 anted
up by investors at the IPO, seven cents goes to the fund's
underwriter and the selling broker. The remaining 93 cents is
actually invested for the benefit of the fund's shareholder.
   Once the IPO hoopla has passed, closed-end funds usually
slip to trade at a discount to the value of their portfolios.
That's when bargain hunters like Mr. Olin turn up. And right
now, Mr. Olin is taking a warmer view of the closed-end bond
funds.
   Stock prices of closed-end bond funds now are slipping so
fast that some funds are moving to shore up their fund's
stock price. Only last week, Massachusetts Financial
Services, which manages seven bond funds and one fund that
buys a mixture of stocks and high-yield junk bonds, says its
funds may start buying back their own shares if the discounts
get wider than 10%.
   But Mr. Olin reckons the bond funds deserve these steep
discounts. "If a bond fund has a 1% expense ratio and its
portfolio is returning 10%, then it should be at a 10%
discount just to be fairly priced," contends Mr. Olin.
   Here's his reasoning. Because his imaginary fund owns
bonds yielding 10% but the fund also has a 1% annual expense
ratio, the portfolio is only returning 9% after expenses,
which is less than the 10% you could earn if you bought the
bonds directly. So Mr. Olin figures that, for the closed-end
to be fairly priced, its stock should also yield 10%. For
that to happen, the fund's stock has to trade at a 10%
discount to the value of the fund's portfolio.
   But on that basis, true bond fund bargains are scarce. If
you cast your eye down the list of closed-end bond funds that
appears in this newspaper every Wednesday, you won't find
many trading at 10% discounts.
   Mr. Olin, however, isn't just hunting for the funds with
the fattest discounts. He is also looking for those discounts
that are almost certain to narrow.
   Take $520 million Prudential Strategic Income, which
splits its assets between U.S. government bonds, junk bonds
and foreign government bonds. The fund came public at $10 in
January 1988, but closed yesterday in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange at $7.125, unchanged, a 5%
discount to its portfolio value of $7.48 a share.
   Because of the discount, the fund's board has proposed
that the fund convert to a regular ("open-end") mutual fund,
which means the discount will be eliminated and shareholders
can sell their shares and get the fund's full net asset
value, as the fund's portfolio value is usually known.
Shareholders will vote on the proposal on Aug. 1, and Mr.
Olin reckons shareholder approval is a sure thing. "I'm
estimating that it will open-end by the end of October, based
on my experience," says Mr. Olin.
   Lately, Mr. Olin has been loading up on $1.3 billion
Comstock Partners Strategy Fund Inc., the top performing
closed-end bond fund for the past 12 months. "They have a
provision to tender for their shares at net asset value in
the second quarter of next year." says Mr. Olin. "This one is
a little less attractive on an annualized basis compared to
Prudential Strategic, but it's a safer portfolio." In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Comstock
Partners closed yesterday at $9.375, unchanged, a 6% discount
to the fund's $9.93 net asset value per share.
   Mr. Olin is betting that $66 million Flexible Bond Trust
Inc. will convert to a mutual fund. The board is in favor of
the change, and a shareholder vote is slotted for Sept. 6.
"The board thinks the open-ending will be effective by the
end of the first quarter of 1991," says Mr. Olin. Between now
and then, shareholders will earn whatever the fund earns,
plus also gaining from the closing of the fund's discount,
which now stands at 7%.
   But because Flexible Bond Trust is so small, Mr. Olin says
buyers should be wary. "You should never put in a market
order," warns Mr. Olin. Instead, he advises putting in a "buy
limit order" at a price slightly below the current market
price. "These closed-ends generally trade at between $6 and
$12, so paying an extra 1/8th is significant," he says.
   If you do decide to buy at the market price, Mr. Olin
suggests using an "immediate or cancel" order, just in case
the market price spikes upwards before your order is
executed.
   Despite his recent foray into bond funds, Mr. Olin has
made most of his money from stock funds. Since turning his
hand to money management in 1981, he has returned 20.8% a
year for clients, versus 17.7% for the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index.
   When digging among stock funds, Mr. Olin also looks for
discounts that he reckons are certain to narrow. He's
currently betting on Clemente Global Growth Fund, which
closed yesterday at a 17% discount to the value of its
portfolio. In 1992, Clemente's shareholders will get to vote
on converting the fund into a regular mutual fund, which --
if approved -- will effectively close the fund's discount. In
composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,
Clemente closed at $10.125, up 12.5 cents.
   Mr. Olin's biggest position is the income shares of Quest
for Value Dual Purpose Fund Inc. A dual purpose fund has two
classes of shares outstanding, income shares and capital
shares. The income shares get all the dividends pulled in by
the fund, while the capital shares benefit from any capital
appreciation in the portfolio stocks.
   Quest for Value will be liquidated in early 1997, at which
point income shareholders will get back $11.60 a share. With
Quest's income shares closing yesterday in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange at at 13.25, down 25 cents,
the shares might seem pricey.
   Not at all, says Mr. Olin. "Those shares are probably as
safe or safer than AA corporates, which are yielding 9.4%,"
says Mr. Olin, who reckons the yield to maturity on Quest's
income shares will be at least 11.9%.
   How so? As the fund's assets appreciate, it's not just the
capital shareholders that benefit. Income shareholders also
gain, because they receive the growing stream of dividends
that is kicked off by an ever-larger pool of assets.

   CASEY, Iowa -- Back in the early 1960s, the worn soil in
Guthrie County barely produced enough corn to feed the local
cattle herds. But then Burdette H. Ruppert began promoting an
elixir called anhydrous ammonia, a nitrogen fertilizer that
could double a field's yield. Local farmers who bought the
elevator manager's new product were soon shipping corn to big
grain export houses along the Mississippi.
   In Casey, it was the start of agriculture's chemical age.
Mr. Ruppert's business surged with the harvests. And when the
huge crops drew rootworms, he sold the farmers insecticides,
too. He crisscrossed the county in a Cadillac, vacationed in
Hawaii, and earned profits so fat that when the local bank
faced a squeeze, he could help bail it out.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But this spring, Mr. Ruppert is selling out. The reason:
He figures the farm chemicals industry he has been part of
for two decades is headed for rough times. "Burdette just saw
the handwriting on the wall," says a local crop consultant,
Douglas Peterson.
   As environmentalism steadily gains ground across America
this spring, one of the movement's unbending targets has been
chemical farming -- witness recent stormy debates over
residues in foods and over groundwater purity. By and large,
U.S. farmers have deflected these protests, citing U.S.
agriculture's vast productivity and arguing that economics
simply leaves them little choice. But this year, as spring
planting nears completion in the Midwest, a gradual shift is
becoming apparent. Thousands of farmers are doing all they
can to reduce the use of chemicals.
   Fertilizer use per acre of corn planted dropped 8% last
year, and insiders estimate it is down again this year, by
anywhere from 2% to as much as 10%. Prices are down, a blow
to chemical companies used to selling about $8 billion of
fertilizer in the U.S. each year. The $5 billion-a-year
pesticide business is harder to measure, because its products
are changing, but usage is basically flat. Best estimates are
that overall volume will grow at maybe 1% to 2% a year
through the 1990s -- half the rate in the 1980s.
   There are many reasons for the shift. Most notably,
farmers themselves worry about overuse of man-made
substances. Their views started to shift in recent years
after surveys began showing widespread contamination of
water. In Iowa, pollsters discovered that nearly three of
every four Iowa farmers now believe that agriculture depends
too much on weedkillers, insecticides and commercial
fertilizers. Nationwide, nearly half of all farmers say they
are increasingly concerned about their own safety.
   Farmers also are using new tillage practices that reduce
the amounts they need to buy. Application methods have the
same effect, by putting the chemicals only on the row and not
between rows.
   And as soil tests get more precise, farmers are learning
that they may have been using more chemicals than they needed
all along. Thirty miles down the road from Casey, farmer Ron
Dunphy last year used a new soil test developed at Iowa State
University that persuaded him to slash his fertilizer use in
half. Yet he still grew 183 bushels of corn an acre --
winning a local corn-yield contest. University of Nebraska
researchers have just concluded that U.S. farmers could cut
their fertilizer and pesticide use by 10% over four years
with little impact on harvests.
   Fertilizer dealers have long tested farmers' soil to see
what it needed. But, says farmer Scott Benton with
skepticism, "it seems like whichever fertilizer dealer did
the test always said there wasn't any nitrogen in the soil"
in order to sell fertilizer. Nitrogen is the nutrient
supplied primarily by anhydrous ammonia, although it can also
be put back in the soil with manure or by rotating a corn
crop with a "nitrogen-fixing" crop like soybeans or alfalfa.
   Awareness of the water-purity issue is clearly on the rise
in Iowa. Last week, high levels of nitrates in water forced
officials in Iowa City to warn parents for the second time
this planting season not to use local water in baby formula.
Nitrates can weaken an infant's ability to carry oxygen in
its blood, causing something called blue baby syndrome.
   Farmers are concerned not only about the water but about
inhaling the chemicals as they apply them. Of 800 U.S.
farmers polled in August by Jefferson Davis Associates, a
Cedar Rapids firm, about half said they worry that their use
of crop chemicals is dangerous to themselves. At the same
time, they're concerned about how it all plays among
city-dwellers. Some 83% said they fear that townspeople blame
them for polluting the environment.
   All this is quite a change for dealers like Mr. Ruppert,
and not a particularly welcome one. A stout gray-haired man
with a florid face and a booming voice, he sits in his office
at Casey Mill &amp; Elevator Inc., at a desk adorned by a
three-inch stack of for-sale notices by other chemical
dealers. "This is a lot tougher business than it used to be,"
he says. "The housewife in Manhattan thinks I'm a dope
peddler."
   According to an Iowa trade group, the number of
farm-chemical dealers in the state is expected to drop by 25%
in the next two years. Like Mr. Ruppert, many will sell to a
big farm cooperative better positioned to finance the
chemical business in an era of meager growth. He frowns at
the sound of workmen mounting a time clock on the wall for
the new owner, Crestland, a fast-expanding $50 million
cooperative.
   It will take work to put the Crestland look on this dusty,
slightly worn business. The elevator, which looms over the
tiny town, sports a purple-and-white sign for the town's
Lutheran Church. Inside the white clapboard office, the sales
counter is papered with notices for pancake fund-raisers and
farm auctions. Rat poison, rubber gloves and pesticide jugs
line one wall. Slumped on wooden chairs, four farmers are
dissecting high-school basketball prospects.
   There was a time when Mr. Ruppert, 56, seemed like a
miracle worker around here. He grew up on a farm outside of
Casey, did a stint in the Army and became a tire salesman.
Then in 1963, his father-in-law made him manager of the
financially troubled grain elevator in town. Soon, he helped
outfit it with a 12,000-gallon tank to hold anhydrous
ammonia.
   Initially, many farmers were afraid of putting something
into the ground that could knock them dead if they inhaled
it. Mr. Ruppert urged the few who agreed to try it not to
treat the five rows next to the road. That way anyone driving
by could see the treated plants towering over the
traditionally grown corn.
   It worked. Anhydrous ammonia not only made corn more
robust, it enabled farmers to grow it year after year in the
same field. Corn, the fuel of the meat industry, was the
best-paying crop to grow, but it sucked so much nitrogen out
of the soil that farmers previously could grow it on a given
field only every other year. Anhydrous ammonia replenished
the nitrogen. In eight years, Guthrie County's corn
production jumped from 6.7 million bushels to 10 million.
   In 1967, however, corn stalks in the area began
collapsing. Growing corn year after year in the same soil had
provided a steady diet for root worms. But this only meant
more business for Mr. Ruppert: He shipped in 10,000 pounds of
pesticides.
   Mr. Ruppert became one of the leading citizens of Casey,
population 473. He had its biggest payroll, nine. He was a
Lutheran church elder, fire chief, Lions Club president and
school official.
   In 1987, the harvest was so big he had to store corn on
the ground. His elevator reaped a windfall storing it for the
government. But the huge stockpiles (which were due to
subsidy programs and foreign-trade trends as well as to the
higher yields) were driving down crop prices.
   That's when the tables began to turn. In one respect, his
chemicals were too effective. They were increasing the amount
of money that the government needed to pay to compensate
farmers for low prices. The government tried to reduce the
surpluses by paying farmers to idle millions of acres of
land. In a hilly county like Guthrie, where the soil is
highly erodible, 25% of the farmland was idled. That meant
fewer sales for Mr. Ruppert.
   Environmental concerns also began to mount. While
surveying landfills for evidence of groundwater
contamination, scientists found traces of pesticides. Dairy
farmers in northeast Iowa discovered nitrate (a form of
nitrogen) in their water troughs. In 1987, Iowa slapped a tax
on fertilizer, with proceeds used to find ways to minimize
chemical usage. The state required farmers to pass a test
showing they could apply the chemicals safely, and it forced
dealers to spend tens of thousands of dollars making sure
products were stored safely.
   Things got tighter when more-precise soil testing began to
hold fertilizer usage down. "I must have been wasting a lot,"
says Mr. Dunphy, of Creston, the farmer who cut his use in
half and still won the crop-yield contest.
   Practices like those adopted by Mr. Benton cut further
into usage. He sprays chemicals in a band on top of his corn
and soybean rows, instead of everywhere, thus cutting his use
of herbicides by 64% and his fertilizer use by 20%.
   Mr. Benton, 31, gives another reason for cutting back: "I
want to farm here for 30 years. I can't afford to poison the
well."
   The government also is beginning to require farmers on
hilly land to adopt conservation techniques if they wish to
continue receiving price-support payments. Instead of turning
over the soil completely, some farmers are building up their
seed beds into ridges. The ridges are permanent -- and only
they will need to be treated with fertilizer. Debris left in
between the ridges prevents weeds from getting sunlight,
reducing the need for herbicides. Researchers now suspect
that the old practice of turning over the soil probably
helped more to plant weeds than to prevent them from growing.
   Farm chemicals unquestionably will continue to serve as a
major tool for farmers. There is little incentive for farmers
to cut deep enough into their use to reduce harvests
substantially. In addition, the Agriculture Department's
best-paying price-support programs are for chemical-dependent
crops such as corn, wheat and cotton.
   At the same time, the era of heady growth is clearly over.
Fertilizer prices are down 10% to 15%. Manufacturers project
nationwide fertilizer consumption to rise about 3% from a
year ago, but this is on an estimated 4% to 5% greater
acreage of corn, the crop on which nearly half of fertilizer
is used.
   An anhydrous ammonia plant hasn't been built in the U.S.
in a decade. W.R. Grace &amp; Co. has shed its fertilizer
operations, and a Mississippi phosphate plant closed in
December. By some estimates, one-third of North American
pesticide manufacturers evaporated in the 1980s. "It's a
no-growth business," says Paul T. Leming, an analyst at
Morgan Stanley.
   Last year, Mr. Ruppert wrote a letter to himself analyzing
his business prospects. The big crop production days of the
county are over and fertilizer prices are slipping, he noted.
Then he typed: "Look for more co-op mergers and further
weakening of profits in the future."
   He also noted that the fertilizer tax Iowa started cost
him $1,226. Insurance costs had grown to $56,197 in 1988 from
$15,983 in 1978, in part because of rising worries by
insurers about the liability of dealers. Required
improvements to his dealership would cost at least another
$50,000. Meanwhile, the paperwork was building: The list of
licenses and permits he needed had grown to 25.
   "Too much risk-margins too low," he wrote. It was time to
sell out.

   Loan to Revlon
   Is Restructured
   By Four Banks

   Changes, Relatively Minor,

   NEW YORK -- Four major banks have restructured a pending
$1.8 billion loan to Revlon Inc., in the latest sign of
lenders' nervousness about making new loans to heavily
indebted companies.
   Although the changes in the Revlon refinancing are
relatively minor, bankers say they occurred partly in
response to regulatory pressure on banks to limit loans for
highly leveraged transactions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revlon, controlled by New York investor Ronald O.
Perelman, has operated under a heavy debt load ever since a
company controlled by Mr. Perelman acquired Revlon in 1986 in
a hostile takeover financed by high-risk, high-yielding junk
bonds.
   The Revlon debt restructuring, first disclosed yesterday
in the American Banker, a trade publication, was forced on
the company and the four banks after other U.S. banks balked
at terms of the new loan. The four banks, units of Chase
Manhattan Corp., Chemical Bank Corp., Citicorp, and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., were seeking to resell parts of
the loan to other banks.
   The changes in the borrowing will boost the fees paid to
some banks that participate in the loan, and accelerate the
repayment of part of the loan by Revlon, a maker of
toiletries, cosmetics and other beauty products. The Revlon
borrowing refinances existing Revlon bank debt.
   The bulk of the new loans carry an interest rate of 1 1/2
percentage points above the prime rate, a common benchmark
for bank loans; the prime is now 10%. The interest rate
wasn't affected by the restructuring. Revlon has another $800
million in junk bonds outstanding, which yield more than 18%
based on their market prices, indicating some uncertainty
among investors about the company's finances.
   The new Revlon debt package consists of $1.25 billion in
term loans plus a $550 million revolving credit without any
set maturity. Originally the term loans had a four-year
maturity, meaning they had to be repaid or refinanced in
1994. To help the banks resell the loans, Mr. Perelman agreed
to repay half the term loan in 1992.
   A statement by the four banks said of the Revlon loan: "In
order to respond to current market conditions, Revlon and the
co-agents are making certain structural and pricing
adjustments to the $1.8 billion transaction currently in the
marketplace." The loan is expected to close in June.
   Although Revlon confirmed that the terms of the loan have
been changed, a spokesman stressed that the refinancing is
voluntary and that the four lead banks have committed to lend
all the money.
   An individual close to the company said the new bank debt
will reduce Revlon's bank interest costs by about one-half a
percentage point. The same person said Revlon's projected
1990 revenue is $2.8 billion, with expected operating cash
flow -- before interest, depreciation, and amortization -- of
more than $400 million.
   The amicable revamping of the loan's terms stands in sharp
contrast to a $7 billion bank borrowing for a proposed
takeover of United Airlines parent UAL Corp., which collapsed
last October amid wrangling between two lead banks and UAL
management.
   The market for bank loans for leveraged transactions has
grown increasingly wobbly in the past year, during which many
heavily indebted companies have suffered financial reversals
and some have been forced to seek bankruptcy-law protection.
Bank regulators have since launched a crackdown on loans for
highly leveraged transactions.
   One banker familiar with the loan said, "There was tougher
going than expected in placing the loan. It's a leveraged
transaction with all the complications therein in a
marketplace with a difficult tone."

   Federal Express Gets Clearance to Merge
   Its Pilot Seniority List With That of Tiger

   Federal Express Corp., overcoming a hurdle that has caused
inefficiencies for the struggling company, said a government
arbitrator cleared the way for the merger of its pilot
seniority list with the seniority list of pilots acquired
with Tiger International Corp.
   But the good news for the company isn't being greeted that
way by some of the affected pilots.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Memphis, Tenn., air express giant has been operating
with two separate pilot lists since buying Tiger last year,
pending arbitration. The company's inability to merge its
roughly 2,000-person pilot force -- comprised of roughly half
former Tiger aviators -- has hampered Federal Express's
efforts to meld the Tiger fleet into its own air operations,
costing the company as much as $150 million a year in
possible savings, analysts have estimated.
   "The decision will now permit the company to integrate the
two pilot groups and achieve greater efficiencies in its air
operations," said Frederick W. Smith, Federal Express's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   But arbitrator George Nicoloau's ruling hasn't ended the
bitter strife within the company over the pilot
seniority-list question. Many longtime Federal Express pilots
fell hundreds of places on the new, merged list, fanning
already bitter feelings over a promise they say Federal made
to them several years ago to "end-tail" -- or put at the
bottom of the list -- aviators acquired in future mergers or
acquisitions. The issue has become a staple gripe at informal
meetings being held on the possible organization of an
independent pilots' union at the company.
   "I feel like we got cheated again," said Richard Sowers, a
Boeing 727 first officer who fell from 642 on the old list to
1,143 on the merged list. "The Fed Ex pilots are the nicest
guys in the world to fly with, but they're so naive it's
embarrassing."
   Mr. Sowers has filed suit against Federal, claiming the
company violated its employment contract with pilots by not
end-tailing the Tiger aviators and by agreeing to let the
arbitrator merge the new pilots into Federal's list. A U.S.
district court judge in Reno, Nev., is expected to rule next
month on a Federal Express motion to dismiss the case.
   But yesterday, as the arbitrator's seniority list arrived
at pilots' homes by mail, Mr. Sowers's lawyer, Leo Donahue of
Sacramento, Calif., said he received calls from some 15
disappointed Federal pilots inquiring how they can join the
suit. Yesterday's calls were on top of dozens of prior
inquiries from pilots in recent weeks, he said.
   "If we get through the motion {for dismissal}, we estimate
we'll have the majority of the crew force in the suit," said
Mr. Donahue.
   A Federal spokeswoman declined to comment on the
litigation, but Mr. Smith has said the contract with the
company's pilots wasn't meant to limit Federal's flexibility
in a merger.
   Gregory Chappars, a 727 captain who went from 284 on the
old list to 515 on the merged list, praised the fairness of
the arbitrator's list, but said some Federal pilots are angry
with the company's recent attempts to change work rules. In
the wake of five consecutive quarters of falling year-to-year
profits, the company has moved to revoke some of the very
vacation perks that management praised so heartily during a
union-affiliation drive last fall, Mr. Chappars said.
Pro-union pilots were trounced in that election.
   "As soon as the union vote was over," said Mr. Chappars,
who said he voted against the union, "they started seeking to
modify those various policies to make working conditions more
onerous." Federal Express officials couldn't be reached for
comment late yesterday evening.

   Software Sales in U.S.
   Grew at Healthy Rate
   In the First Quarter

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Software Publishers Association said
domestic software sales grew at a surprisingly healthy rate
in the first quarter.
   North American sales grew 26%, and international sales by
U.S. software companies jumped even higher -- by 50% -- in
the same period. The news is a major departure from 1989,
when the annual growth rate in domestic software sales slowed
to 12% from the previous year; in 1988, by contrast, the
annual growth rate was up 40% from 1987.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bright figures "shocked us," said the association's
research director, Ann Stephens, who said that the first
quarter is generally the software industry's slowest season.
   Ms. Stephens attributed the growth largely to the
introduction of a plethora of new products and upgrades and
to improved distribution controls. Most encouraging, she
said, is evidence that the sales surge is highest in
traditional categories like spreadsheets and word processors,
"which shows that fundamentally the industry is doing well."
   Word processors had the largest and fastest growth for the
period, with $117 million in sales, an 88% rise. The SPA data
are based on monthly sales information from 150 leading PC
software publishers.
   "The popular wisdom was that domestic sales have stalled,"
said SPA executive director Ken Wasch. "But this is the best
quarter we've had in years." And preliminary numbers for
April, he said, suggest that the sales improvement will
continue.
   Mr. Wasch partly credited a crackdown on illegal software
copying -- an anti-piracy campaign that was spearheaded by
his association last year and reinforced by several recent
and hefty court settlements on the issue.
