July, but the nation's current account balance is still in a

surplus of $6 million in July on a customs clearance basis.
This compared with a $230 million June surplus.

   Korean exports grew 5.1% in July from a year ago, to
$5.502 billion, while imports expanded 6.7%, to $5.496
billion, producing a surplus of $6 million, the officials
said.
   The July surplus reduced Korea's seven-month trade deficit
to $2.76 billion, which compared with a $1.6 billion surplus
a year ago, they said.

   With No Iron Curtain, They Hide
   Good Will Behind a Smoke Screen

   SEATTLE -- The Cold War may be history, but that hasn't
eased the tension for about 1,400 hard-smoking Soviets
billeted here for the 17-day Goodwill Games.
   What has the Soviets fuming is Seattle's aggressive
no-smoking policy. Only 22% of Seattlites smoke -- the U.S.
average is 29% -- and the pristine city boasts one of the
nation's toughest anti-smoking laws. Not so in Moscow, where
nearly half of all residents regularly light up, or in Baku,
where the smoker average flares to 65%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With that kind of cultural disparity, finding a place to
puff in peace can be tough here. A manual issued by Goodwill
Games officials to Seattlites playing host to Soviets warns
the locals to be prepared for their visitors' smoking habits.
   "Provide a place for them to smoke," the directive
suggests. "Soviets will understand if that place is outside."
   But banishing Soviet smokers to the back yard can be
tricky. "We've had hosts haul their visitors down here
begging us to explain they can't smoke in the house," says
Pamela Rice, an interpreter at the Pepsi Friendship Center,
an international gathering ground set up for Soviets in
downtown Seattle.
   Vladimir Geskin, a deputy editor of the Moscow newspaper
Sovietski Sport, complained about Seattle's hard-nosed
attitude toward smoking in a front-page byline article in the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer this week. Mr. Geskin wailed that
even the Games press center is off-limits for smokers. "That
is a neutral international territory," he said. "Not to let
me smoke violates my human rights."
   Steven Smith, a Games housing coordinator, says one Soviet
visitor called the Goodwill hot line begging to be
transferred to a house where he could smoke. "He said, `I
want to smoke and I want to drink. This rich yuppie has too
many rules.'" After a search, the unhappy Soviet was shifted
to a more amenable residence. "He called back and said, `We
are smokers. We are brothers,'" Mr. Smith says.
   At a residence hall set up for actors from the Sovremennik
Theater of Moscow, a nervous house manager called a fire
drill after most of the troupe lit up after dinner.
   Robert Rosner, a director of the Goodwill housing program,
says Soviet officials failed to include information about
their countrymen's smoking habits. When Goodwill officials
surveyed the concerns of potential hosts, Mr. Rosner says,
"Smoking came in ahead of `What do I do if they want to
defect.'"

   Cleveland-Cliffs Workers
   Strike at 2 Michigan Mines

<LP>
   CLEVELAND -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. said 2,000 workers
began a strike at two Michigan mines it manages after members
of the United Steelworkers rejected an offer that would have
increased wages by about $1.50 an hour over four years.
   No further talks have been scheduled and neither side
would predict how long the strike would last.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said union demands would have led to an
overall $40-per hour increase in benefits and wages over the
four-year contract.
   But David Foster, a negotiator for the workers, said union
demands amounted to about a $12-per-hour increase over four
years and added that the company did not respond to three
subsequent union offers. "We're waiting to negotiate," he
said.
   Mr. Foster said workers currently earn an average of
$13.70 an hour including incentive pay, about the same level
they were paid in 1982.
   For Cleveland-Cliffs, a prolonged strike could be
devastating. The two mines, in Empire and Tilden, account for
a large share of the company's business, with a combined
annual capacity of 16 million tons. The strike could also
hurt other company operations, which support the primary iron
ore business.
   "It will be a very expensive strike," particularly if it
lasts for more than a week or two, said Harry W. Millis, an
analyst at Cleveland's McDonald &amp; Co. Both mines were
producing and shipping at near capacity, Mr. Millis added, so
they won't be able to make up for lost output.
   The two mines, which are owned by a group that includes a
Cleveland-Cliffs subsidiary and steel companies, produced 8.3
million tons of iron ore pellets in the first seven months of
this year.
   A company spokesman said the last strike against
Cleveland-Cliffs was in 1977. The company, which manages four
other mines, posted second-quarter earnings of $14.1 million,
or $1.21 per share, on revenue of $89.3 million.

   CINCINNATI -- A federal jury acquitted Miami Beach, Fla.,
hotelier Leonard A. Pelullo on all charges that he defrauded
a Gahanna, Ohio, thrift.
   Mr. Pelullo and Houston businessman David A. Friedmann had
been charged in U.S. district court in Cincinnati with four
counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy involving
the now defunct Savings One Association, which Mr. Friedmann
once owned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Cincinnati jury's decision removes a cloud hanging
over Mr. Pelullo in a lengthy legal battle with DWG Corp.,
the centerpiece of Miami financier Victor Posner's battered
financial empire. Mr. Pelullo, a former consultant to Mr.
Posner, is seeking a Cleveland federal court's permission to
sue DWG for $8 million in fees he claims he is owed.
   Granada Investments Inc., an investment company with which
Mr. Pelullo once was associated, has filed a lawsuit in the
same Cleveland court alleging that Mr. Posner and DWG's
directors shirked their fiduciary duty and manipulated DWG's
stock in rejecting Granada's $22-a-share, or $572 million,
bid for DWG last year.
   DWG has countersued, charging that Granada's bid was a
sham intended to boost the value of its DWG holdings. The
company also alleged that the investor group obtained its
original DWG stake based on "material, non-public, inside
information" obtained by Mr. Pelullo during his time as a
consultant. The two sides, which each deny any wrongdoing,
are involved in settlement talks.
   The thrift indictment handed up by a federal grand jury
here last year alleged that Messrs. Pelullo and Friedmann
conspired to obtain a $1 million loan that was used for
purposes other than stated in the loan applications.
   The indictment also alleged that Mr. Pelullo paid Mr.
Friedmann some $145,000 in kickbacks for help in obtaining
loans.
   But Mr. Pelullo argued in court that the alleged kickback
was, in fact, a deposit he had placed in escrow to be used as
prepaid interest on a loan extension he was expecting to
receive, and that Mr. Friedmann had stolen the money.
   Mr. Friedmann, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to
go to trial Aug. 13.

   I was outraged that you published and consequently
endorsed Dave Shiflett's review "Bookshorts: Help for the
Suburban Yard Slave" (Leisure &amp; Arts, July 17). In the guise
of a book review on how-to manuals for lawn-mower repairs,
the author has found a rather unimaginative way to divulge
his prehistoric sexist thinking. I am disappointed that the
editors of The Wall Street Journal did not recognize this
rhetoric as offensive bigotry.
   The article, based on the premise that man is inherently
"oppressed" by woman, is blatantly insolent in its attempt to
make a potentially dull subject humorous. It is not difficult
to imagine Mr. Shiflett to be a morally inept, social outcast
in any slightly progressive society. His article became
quickly ineffectual in reviewing the manuals because of the
emotional response it provoked by attacking women as being a
race of low-IQ slave drivers who sit indoors packing
themselves with carbohydrates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What a pity it must be to live in Mr. Shiflett's world of
fat, screaming wives who demand a manicured lawn before they
can feel at peace with themselves and their marriages. I find
little in common with the people who must live on Mr.
Shiflett's little suburban block and I am sure that most of
your well-educated and enterprising readers would agree.

   Racial Demagogues: Old as America, Ever the Same

   When you pull back from the particulars of daily
journalism, from the diet of new sensations fed up on the
morning and evening cycles, you begin to discern familiar
patterns. Disparate events and separate strands take on a
coherence that may be more apparent than real, but that at
least offer the possibility of intelligent response rather
than reflexive reaction. Think about the names Marion Barry,
David Duke, Louis Farrakhan, Jesse Helms and Jesse Jackson,
think about what each conjures up, then think again. It
helps, if only to put them in perspective.
   For the longest time now, it has been virtually impossible
to have a conversation in Washington, D.C., without talking
about Mayor Barry. The outcome of his trial will not change
that situation. In fact, it will probably exacerbate it.
While it would be a mistake to say that all reactions to the
man and his troubles are based on race, it would be true to
say that most whites think he is a charlatan and felon and
most blacks think he is a victim.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For an even longer time, many white Democrats have
regarded Jesse Jackson with fascinated horror. They know they
don't like him, know that millions of voters essential to
Democratic Party success wildly admire him, and don't have a
clue about how to keep his supporters in the fold while
depriving him not only of the presidential nomination he
covets but also of veto power at the next national
convention. The mainstreamers say Mr. Jackson's race has
nothing to do with their concerns, except insofar as it is
obvious that what they regard as his demagoguery emits from a
black man. Vast numbers of his supporters are convinced
beyond the shadow of a doubt that Mr. Jackson's race is the
only reason he has been denied the nomination twice already.
   Louis Farrakhan, Nation of Islam leader and sometime buddy
of both Jesse Jackson and Marion Barry, preaches a brand of
carefully orchestrated anti-Semitism that carries the whiff
of the gas chamber for many American Jews, and many other
Americans who are not Jews as well. His admirers and
followers, some from within the black mainstream, tend to
concentrate on other features of his message. They dismiss
the charges of anti-Semitism as so many smokescreens designed
to obscure the validity of his indictments of white bigotry
and black dependency.
   Over in that journalistic corner reserved for what are
mistakenly considered regional phenomena, there is David Duke
of Louisiana. The born-again Louisiana politician, who was a
Ku Klux Klansman only yesterday and consorts with haters
today, has learned to package himself as a modern-day Huey
Long. Running for the U.S. Senate after winning an upset
election to the Louisiana legislature several years ago, he
offers a white populism tailored to the resentments of
working whites and the troubled middle class in a state whose
economy has been in recession for most of the past decade.
His racism is in code these days, but it's not hard to break.
His supporters think they've met the political Deliverer.
Some of his opponents profess to see in Duke a warning of
things to come, the failed beer hall putschtist re-emerging
as potent political leader.
   Finally, there is Jesse Helms, whose coded racism is no
less obvious than Mr. Duke's and whose uncoded segregationist
past is all laid out on the public record. The North Carolina
senator has far more real, rather than symbolic, power than
any of the others, but his core constituency is no less
alienated from mainstream America than theirs. Small-town
merchants, farmers, fundamental religionists affronted by the
erosion of old values in the nation's daily life, they
repeatedly place their hopes for political salvation in the
hands of a man whose economic positions are as damaging to
their actual interests as his rhetoric is reassuring to their
emotions.
   What all of these men have in common is that they aren't
going much further politically and were never going much
further politically. Each has a limited base. What they also
have in common is that all are able to pull the dominant
majority's chain with what is, for their followers,
satisfying ease. Nothing so validates their true believers'
faith than the rage and fear their champions seem to inspire.
   In the most basic sense, it hardly matters what objective
analyses Messrs. Farrakhan, Duke, Helms, Jackson or Barry
might reveal. Whether these men are wise or dumb -- and none
is dumb -- demagogues or saints, arrogant criminals or
persecuted prophets, each has tapped a deep well of grievance
and despair. Whatever the validity of their particular
messages, whatever their character defects, they fill a need
within disaffected communities that orthodox politicians have
left untouched.
   It is an old story in American politics. Racism has been a
constant in this heterogeneous society for two centuries.
Nativism has sparked new parties and regenerated Klans
repeatedly. Black nationalism as a reaction to white
oppression crests and falls with regularity. The politics of
paranoia has been practiced by men with Irish names, Anglo
names, black faces and red necks. Irrationalism apparently
comes with the territory.
   But words such as "paranoid," "racist" and "irrational"
make for better categorization than they do for solution. The
divides are made no more bridgeable when opposing forces line
up on either side to shake their fists and scream epithets.
It is the task of intelligent politics to separate the
legitimate from the unacceptable among the messages, to
confront the latter and redress the former. Behaving like
Chicken Little is no answer at all.
   Neither, however, is the tendency in several quarters to
try to adapt to the messengers, to rationalize the irrational
and explain away the unacceptable. It is nauseating to watch
intelligent black leaders making common cause with a
Farrakhan, or drawing careful distinctions to justify their
failure to repudiate his vile anti-Semitism. It is equally
unacceptable for a decent, thoughtful Republican such as Sen.
Nancy Kassenbaum to make a campaign spot for Jesse Helms, or
for several major corporations with reputations for social
concern to contribute big bucks to his library, revealing
cynical self-interest.
   What is needed is a political system that reflects the
legitimate concerns of the economically and culturally
dispossessed and tries to remedy them. There must be a
responsive hearing for those who believe their race or
beliefs or economic condition have rendered them irrelevant
in their own country. Instead of two parties fighting for the
same narrow middle ground, for the attention of the 50% of
adult Americans who are currently political participants,
there should be at least one party that will provide a home
and a megaphone for those who aren't making it and be a
mediating center for their competitive claims.
   Without one, the names will change and the faces will come
and go, but the disaffection, hatred and despair will remain,
ready to be tapped by new demagogues promising new forms of
salvation. Talking about Marion Barry or David Duke passes
the time, but it misses the point. Doing something about the
welling frustrations that such men represent and articulate
is the task at hand.

   Why Do Federal Agencies Behave as They Do?

   Political scientists long have assumed that politicians
behave as they do to increase their chances of being
re-elected. But officials of powerful agencies, such as the
Federal Reserve System, don't have to run for election.
Robert Auerbach, a former congressional and Treasury
economist who now teaches at the University of California,
Riverside, suggests agency officials have another motive: to
increase the power of their agencies.
   In a paper presented at the recent Western Economic
Association meeting in San Diego, Prof. Auerbach focuses
mainly on the Fed, and it's true that no other agency offers
so many examples of action dictated by power-preservation.
But it should be noted, right off the bat, that acting to
preserve or to enhance power doesn't necessarily mean acting
against the public's interest. The Fed was created by an act
of Congress. If it is perceived to be working mainly to build
its power, it can be reformed or even abolished at any time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Fed has to play to a variety of audiences. For several
weeks the Bush administration has been pressing the Federal
Reserve to lower the federal funds rate, arguing that lower
interest rates are needed to keep the sluggish business
expansion alive. But inflation has been stubbornly refusing
to diminish, and the Fed has been fearful that the markets
would see lower interest rates as a sign that the central
bank has given up the fight against rising prices.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's July performances were, to
say the least, agile. He wanted to reduce the fed funds rate,
the fee charged on very short-term loans of bank reserves,
but he didn't want to make a big thing out of it. So he made
the announcement a few days before the semiannual monetary
hearings in Congress, hoping that the action would seem
somewhat less significant.
   And why was the funds rate being cut? Not because the Fed
saw an imminent recession or a real credit crunch. It was
just that bank credit policies and capital requirements
appear to be causing an unintended tightening of bank credit
conditions. The lowering of the funds rate, Mr. Greenspan
emphasized, did not represent any lessening of the Fed's
determination to fight inflation.
   Unfortunately, the argument didn't fly. Administration
officials and others who wanted lower interest rates to spur
the economy complained that the action was too little and too
late. The bond market and others concerned about growing
signs of inflation thought the Fed had, indeed, abandoned its
anti-inflation principles. So late in the month, before the
House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan was arguing that he
was, too, fighting inflation. He cited the fact that various
versions of the money supply (which the Fed hasn't mentioned
much recently) were hardly growing at all. That, of course,
only increased the worries of the part of the central bank's
audience that thinks the Fed is trying to push the economy
over the edge of a cliff.
   The recent developments help to illustrate why the Fed's
power-preservation program has usually included an effort to
keep its business, as much as possible, to itself. If the
public doesn't know what the Federal Reserve is trying to do,
it's difficult to say that the effort has been a failure.
Chairman Greenspan, in fact, has been criticized by some Fed
followers for what they see as his "open mouth" policy.
   Prof. Auerbach has collected some samples from the past to
show the central bank's usual preference for secrecy. In
1974, for instance, Wright Patman, then the chairman of the
House Banking Committee, asked the Fed for salary data for
employees of the Board of Governors and the Reserve Banks
earning $20,000 or more a year, together with the salaries
they were receiving three years earlier.
   Mr. Patman, it should be stressed, was always concerned
about how the Fed was spending money; he once became quite
disturbed when he learned how much a regional bank was
spending on table-tennis balls. But he was an official of
Congress and the Fed is a creature of Congress, so Chairman
Arthur Burns had to reply.
   Mr. Burns said he would of course supply the information,
but he urged Mr. Patman to keep it to himself. "In recent
years," he wrote, "there have been numerous unfortunate
incidents, such as kidnappings and robberies, perpetrated on
individuals in the United States. To minimize such risks to
Federal Reserve officials, the names of individual employees
in the categories you mentioned should, I feel, be held in
confidence." This effort must have succeeded; at any rate,
there is no record that any $20,000-a-year clerks
subsequently were kidnapped.
   In the Federal Reserve's campaign to keep things to
itself, an occasional obstacle has been the General
Accounting Office, a highly regarded agency that, when
requested, looks into goings-on around the government. In the
early 1970s Congress was considering a bill that would have
authorized the GAO to audit Fed records. The Board of
Governors persuaded officials of regional banks to lobby,
evidently successfully, against the legislation.
   If the Fed is to be audited, the Fed would rather do it
itself. In 1979, just after the central bank had announced
its intention to pay more attention to monetary aggregates,
it reported a sudden sharp rise in the aggregates that
actually hadn't occurred. The House Banking Committee asked
the Fed to investigate to learn whether any employee had
profited from the error.
   The Federal Reserve could have asked Congress to call in
the GAO, but instead it hired a private law firm, which hired
a private accounting firm. The bill came to $877,675.88. The
Fed received a clean bill of health except for brief mention
of possible insider trading by a Fed employee.
   The recent experiences should, but probably won't,
encourage the Federal Reserve to launch its own version of
glasnost. If the public doesn't know what you're doing, it's
true that it's harder to blame you for failures. But in an
atmosphere of mystery the suspicion may eventually develop
that you're up to no good.

   MADRID -- Spain's state-controlled oil concern Repsol S.A.
said first-half profit rose 1.4% to 39.68 billion pesetas
($406.6 million) from 39.14 billion pesetas a year earlier,
but called the results "positive," in light of the
"extraordinarily strong" 1989 first-half results and lower
crude oil prices.
   Revenue fell 11% to 58.455 billion pesetas from 65.413
billion pesetas. But Repsol said that without an 11
billion-peseta depreciation on the value of its crude-oil and
oil-products inventories, revenue would have totaled more
than 69 billion pesetas.

   Study Says Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria
   Are Common in Infants of 2 Poor Nations

   BOSTON -- Researchers here found antibiotic-resistant
bacteria in almost all infants they studied in two developing
countries, suggesting that such bacteria have become a major
public health threat world-wide.
   However, only about half of U.S. infants they studied
carried such bacteria -- a surprisingly low prevalence,
considering the heavy U.S. use of antibiotics. The finding
offers new hope for the fight against antibiotic-resistant
bacteria in the developed world, said Thomas F. O'Brien, a
co-author of the study and a physician at Boston's Brigham
and Women's Hospital.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Doctors are increasingly alarmed about the proliferation
of disease-causing bacteria that resist antibiotics. When
patients take antibiotics, their internal microbes
susceptible to the drugs die off. But if resistant strains of
bacteria are present, they quickly grow like weeds in a newly
cleared field. Thus, the more antibiotics used, the more
antibiotic-resistant bacteria there are. And once a resistant
strain arises, it can travel fast -- penicillin-resistant
gonorrhea bacteria, for example, have spread internationally
in recent years.
   Moreover, scientists have discovered that genes conferring
resistance can move from one strain of bacteria to another.
That means antibiotics are turning benign bacteria that exist
in all animals' intestines into reservoirs of
antibiotic-resistant genes. Such genes can later be
transferred to disease-causing bacteria with devastating
results.
   In their study, published in today's issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine, the Boston researchers found
that more than 95% of healthy infants they surveyed in
Caracas, Venezuela, and in Qin Pu, China, carried at least
one strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their
intestines. Some of the infants never had been given
antibiotics, an indication that resistant bacteria are
ubiquitous in the infants' environments and infect them soon
after birth.
   Heavy, indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the Third
World probably accounts for the finding, said Dr. O'Brien.
One reason is poor sanitation, causing high rates of
infectious disease. Moreover, "in the developing world, it's
a big event to go to the doctor," he said. "Consumers are
very oriented to coming home with something to take," which
typically is an antibiotic. And if they can't afford to visit
a doctor, Third World consumers often get antibiotics from
pharmacists or street vendors, Dr. O'Brien said.
   The drugs also are used heavily in the developed world --
accounting for around 35% of drug prescriptions for U.S.
children under the age of three in 1986, according to one
study.
   But U.S. doctors typically use them selectively.
Laboratory tests on their patients can tell them which
antibiotic, if any, will best kill the infecting bacteria.
Thus, "we don't so often get the situation where people are
banging away at a bacteria with an antibiotic until a
resistant strain emerges," said Dr. O'Brien.
   When such strains do emerge, U.S. doctors respond with
newer -- and usually costlier -- antibiotics that haven't yet
spawned bacteria immune to them. But now, "multiresistant"
bacteria, which are immune to different antibiotics, are
emerging. More than half of the resistant bacteria found in
babies the Boston researchers studied -- including the U.S.
ones -- were immune to more than one antibiotic.
   Still, the fact that perhaps half of U.S. infants begin
life without resistant bacteria suggests that many people,
with a little care, could avoid such microbes, said Dr.
O'Brien. For instance, he said, consumers should avoid taking
unneeded antibiotics. And they shouldn't chop meat, which
might contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, on surfaces used
to prepare salads.

   Citibank Assumes a Starring Role in Asia
   ---
   Targeting the Affluent,
   It Outperforms Local Banks

   HONG KONG -- Sarah Lo steps into the air-conditioned lobby
of a Citibank branch here to take her place behind three
people waiting to approach the teller's open counter. Two
others are using the automatic teller machines nearby.
   Meanwhile, at a branch of a major local bank half a block
away, more than 20 people stand impatiently in a queue that
snakes through the lobby toward distant tellers perched
behind thick, counter-to-ceiling bulletproof plastic. Seven
other customers stand outside in sweltering heat to use the
bank's streetside ATMs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For Ms. Lo, one of the many young Hong Kong professionals
that Citibank targets, the appearances are important. "You
can tell they're better; it's a big difference from local
banks," she says.
   The scene repeats itself, with variations, across much of
Asia. Whether financing motor scooters in Bombay or marketing
"preferred" gold credit cards to yuppies in Singapore,
Citibank is doggedly pursuing in Asia its goal of becoming a
global consumer bank -- the grand vision of John Reed,
chairman of Citibank's parent, Citicorp.
   Perhaps nowhere has Citibank been more successful than in
Asia, competing with entrenched domestic banks on their own
turf by offering innovative services, new technology and, as
in Ms. Lo's case, giving customers what they want. In some
countries, Citibank is nudging entire banking sectors
forward, though analysts warn that domestic monoliths have
awakened and competition may intensify.
   Citibank officials imagine that in a few years, customers
will be able to tap their accounts through ATMs around the
world. Already, there are 22 Asian banking centers at
Citibank offices in such cities as New York, Los Angeles and
London to serve mobile Asian clients.
   "Citibank behaves in every market like a local bank," says
the general manager of another U.S. bank in Hong Kong.
"They've taken a much bigger chance than other foreign
banks," which traditionally have left the retail side to
domestic banks.
   Pei-yuan Chia, group executive in charge of Citibank's
international consumer banking, says the bank intends to
reach 10 million affluent Asian households by the end of the
decade, a fivefold increase from the present. That's an
expensive proposition when stretched across Asia, from Japan
to India. And the cost could rise if economic growth slows or
banking liberalization stalls in just a couple of those
countries.
   "Probably every bank that is looking at the retail side of
banking is looking at Citibank as the benchmark," says Brian
Waterhouse, a banking analyst for James Capel (Far East)
Ltd., an affiliate of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.
Another analyst calls Citibank a "screaming success in Asia.
Citibank's approach in consumer banking has been excellent."
   The bank's approach in Hong Kong is based on years of
experience with its giant New York network. Citibank even
sent out Steve H. Price, former head of consumer banking in
New York, to run the North Asia division. Mr. Price says
consumer banking in the British colony is nearly as advanced
as in New York, and that Citibank is positioned even better
in Hong Kong than in New York. "We're more successful because
we're really tightly focused," he says.
   That focus is the top 30% to 50% income bracket of the
population, to whom the bank markets itself as a status
symbol and a leader in service in a competitive banking
environment. "If you want to buy from K mart, don't come to
us, but if you think Gucci is the right thing, then we are
the right thing," Mr. Chia says.
   Ms. Lo is the perfect Citibank target. She is a chic
accountant in her early 30s who works in the colony's Central
commercial and financial district. She has accounts at
several banks and knows the rates paid at others. After
shopping around, Ms. Lo chose Citibank because it paid more
on foreign-currency deposits than local banks did. And, Ms.
Lo says, the bank's advertisements didn't lie: Citibank
service is better.
   Like local banks, Citibank plans to stay in Hong Kong
after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Its
exposure in the territory seems to highlight the risk
Citibank runs by investing in many Asian markets at once.
Problems in one country could hurt the bank regionwide.
   For example, more than half of Citibank's Hong Kong loan
portfolio is in home mortgages, most of which stretch beyond
1997. Hong Kong people might walk away from their debts, some
banking analysts caution. But Mr. Price says the mortgages
are made mostly to the "people who will stay in Hong Kong."
   Other Citibank officials note that the bank has profited
in more volatile locales. In the Philippines, where a
revolution and a series of coup attempts in the past few
years have crippled the economy, Citibank benefited because
customers shifted their deposits to it from local banks. More
generally, bank officials say, Citibank's regional strategy
ensures that if operations in one country suffer, steady
business in the rest of Asia will compensate.
   Citibank's Asian strategy is costly. Officials won't say
how much the bank is investing in the region, except that it
is "a lot and not enough."
   Investment is concentrated in two areas: credit cards and
technology. Telebanking and sophisticated ATMs help the bank
overcome the disadvantage of government limitations on local
branch networks. In Japan, nearly 30% of the bank's customers
were able to open their accounts without ever stepping into a
branch office. In some cities, Citibank provides personal
bankers so that customers can become familiar with the same
person over time.
   Citibank's approach to local banking often seems
far-fetched in the region's less-developed markets. In
Taiwan, for example, the idea of a mortgage was revolutionary
until the mid-1980s, so much so that the government was
reluctant to let Citibank offer mortgages.
   Home purchases in Taiwan long were financed in the Chinese
tradition, borrowing from family or tapping lifetime savings.
But as property prices soared and more young people entered
the housing market, Citibank saw an opening. Citibank's
requests to offer home mortgages were turned down twice
before regulators in Taipei decided in 1985 to "give those
crazy Americans a chance," as one Citibank executive puts it.
Today, Citibank remains ahead of its competition in the
mortgage business.
   Citibank officials now plan to introduce telebanking so
that customers can bank without having to negotiate Taipei's
notorious traffic to reach one of the two branches. But
Citibank remains limited to two branches to serve the island
republic's 20 million people. Further expansion depends in
part on the continuation of banking liberalization, as is the
case in South Korea and Thailand, where Citibank repeated its
success in mortgages and where the bank is also restricted
from enlarging its branch network.
   "Where markets are highly protected, there's a limit as to
how much Citibank can do," says Richard Wong, a principal
with Egon Zehnder International Ltd., an international
executive search firm. "But if you assume liberalization,
Citibank should be able to expand."
   So far, the governments of the three countries are
convinced that Citibank is helping to improve consumer
banking overall. But local banks are pressing regulators to
slow liberalization so they can regroup to fight the foreign
competition.
   Government restrictions are a problem in 10 of the 15
Asian countries where Citibank now operates. "That's a big
number," says Citibank's Mr. Chia.

   `Godfather' Brando Parodies Himself

   Watching "The Freshman" is like listening to an amiable
eccentric trying to tell an intricate and entertaining joke
but not quite pulling it off. You're glad to laugh anyway
because the whole scene moves with such a bizarre and
original rhythm the missed beats don't seem to matter.
   Director and writer Andrew Bergman has used this Mafia
farce as a showcase for Marlon Brando's exquisitely metered
piece of self-parody. Mr. Brando gently mocks his status as
pop icon without belittling the films that carried some of
his most venerated performances. Playing Carmine Sabatini, an
unconventional Mafia boss with a particular fondness for
endangered wildlife, Mr. Brando slyly invokes "The
Godfather's" Don Corleone even as he makes Carmine something
entirely new.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bergman, best known as a writer of light Broadway
comedy, has put Mr. Brando at the center of a complicated
piece of comic machinery. He gets it all moving with the
story of Clark Kellogg (Matthew Broderick), a boy from
Vermont who goes to film school in New York City and almost
immediately finds himself tangled up with the mob. Mr.
Broderick's habitual pose of the naive-yet-knowing wise guy
works well here, as Clark both narrates and acts out this
improbable tale.
   The picture flounders at the beginning, as Mr. Bergman
tries to establish Clark's nightmarish introduction to New
York. No sooner is Clark off the train at Grand Central
Station than he's hustled by a fast-talking con artist who
drives the newcomer downtown for too much money, then steals
all his things. The reception isn't much warmer at school,
where his film professor and adviser hasn't any sympathy for
Clark's predicament.
   These opening scenes have a purpose, though, which is to
bring Clark together with Carmine, and to set the stage for
numerous "Godfather" jokes, which Mr. Bergman has written
with a generous touch of absurdity. Yet he's more certain as
writer than director; he doesn't always choreograph the
visual wit in a way that will bring the jokes to life,
especially at the beginning. The movie starts out sluggish
and awkward, like a dance-school student who can mouth the
steps ("slow, quick quick . . .") but forgets to move his
feet.
   Eventually, however, the picture does get under way and
turns up many strange pleasures, not least of which is the
incomparable sight of Bert Parks hosting a bit of gastronomic
pageantry featuring a menu consisting entirely of endangered
species.
   Many of the film-school jokes either don't work or are
somewhat esoteric (like the giant poster of Brian De Palma's
glowering face at the back of a classroom). But one doesn't
need to have studied film to appreciate Paul Benedict's Prof.
Fleeber, a man who has thought entirely too much about the
relationship between Karl Marx and the Lake Tahoe scene in
"The Godfather."
   As Prof. Fleeber delves deeper and deeper into the
make-believe Mafia, Clark becomes an errand boy for the real
thing. He gets to meet Carmine's family, a much more good
natured and easy-going crew than the Corleone clan. For
example, his daughter, Tina (Penelope Ann Miller), earnestly
explains her credentials for Harvard: If she doesn't get in,
the garbage won't get picked up anymore. She and her father
live in an overdone suburban palazzo, and their prize
possession is Leonardo Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," wired to play
Nat King Cole's "Mona Lisa" with the touch of a
remote-control button.
   The picture never loses the feeling of being slightly
unbalanced. Yet lack of glibness becomes endearing at a time
when so many pictures consist of slick surface and nothing
else. Besides, "The Freshman's" ungainliness is continually
steadied by Mr. Brando's sure presence. Pay attention right
up to the end, or you will miss the picture's best joke, Mr.
Brando's sweet, goofy homage to "On the Waterfront."
   ---
   Louis Malle's most recent film, "May Fools," opens with
the death of a bright-eyed elderly woman. Just before she
dies, she's listening to news of strikes and student revolt
-- it's 1968 -- and weeping. When the camera pulls back,
however, you see she's crying because she's cutting onions.
Shortly thereafter she gasps, walks slowly up the stairs,
falls on a couch occupied by antique dolls, and dies.
   Mr. Malle stages this scene with a tone that is both
poignant and lightly mocking, a tone he maintains throughout
this enjoyable picture about the 1968 "revolution" in France
and its effect on one bourgeois family. The events all take
place on the dead woman's country estate, where she's lived
with her middle-aged son and where her varied eccentric heirs
descend to divvy up the goods. They are forced to stay longer
than planned, because the funeral workers are on strike. With
grandma's body lying in the parlor, more and more resembling
just another piece of antique furniture, her children and
grandchildren play out the changes affecting the wider world
among themselves.
   All of this is carried out with a gentle touch, as Mr.
Malle develops the foibles of his various types: the
middle-aged man who refuses to "grow up"; his annoyingly
responsible daughter; the young man calling for revolution
who seduces his aunt's girlfriend. It's all very pretty and
amusing, in keeping with the breezy Stephane Grappelli music
that makes it all hum.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: It's always fun to take a look at Marlon Brando
over the years, and "On the Waterfront" is a good place to
start. Though you'll want to look at the obvious films --
"The Godfather," "Last Tango in Paris," "The Wild One,"
"Streetcar Named Desire" -- check out failed ventures such as
"The Missouri Breaks" as well. You can always fast-forward.

   CONCORD, Calif. -- Fibreboard Corp. said it decided
against selling its Northstar-at-Tahoe resort after an
18-month search failed to turn up a buyer at a satisfactory
price.
   The company announced plans in December 1988 to sell the
resort, located near Lake Tahoe in Northern Calif., as part
of a restructuring aimed at focusing itself on core wood
products and insulation businesses. The company said it
entered into "serious" talks with two buyers, both
foreign-based, but wasn't able to close the transaction.
Fibreboard carries the resort on its books at about $19
million; some analysts thought the company was hoping to
fetch double that price in a sale.

   STOCKHOLM -- Share prices on the Oslo Stock Exchange
surged to a third consecutive record close this week, fueled
by prospects of higher oil and metal prices, as well as
Norway's brightening domestic economy.
   While markets elsewhere in Scandinavia barely began to
stir from summer vacation doldrums, Oslo erupted with a
flurry of trading. The all-share index on Monday jumped 5.55
points to 652.5, eclipsing the record set in mid-March. The
index added 7.4 points on Tuesday and 4.88 points yesterday
to close at 664.78. This represents a three-day spurt of 2.9%
and leaves the Oslo index up 26.7% for the year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Market analysts have been anticipating an autumn rally,
because of positive economic indicators such as dwindling
inflation and interest rates, as well as a likely buying
binge by institutional investors, but many have been
surprised by the speed of this week's gains. The rally
rekindled bullish sentiment that prevailed earlier in the
year: In the first six weeks, Oslo's index climbed 11%, after
soaring 54% in 1989.
   Last week's agreement by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, aimed at boosting the price of crude
oil, triggered the surge in Oslo's equity prices, market
analysts said. "Almost all shares quoted on the Oslo market
are oil or shipping related, and have benefited from the
increase in oil prices," DnB Securities' chief equity
analyst, Sigmund Ellingboe, said. "Foreign investors, who
often use the Oslo market as a way to diversify into oil or
shipping investments, have been a key factor in this week's
rally."

   Life Insurer Agrees
   To Acquire Mutual

   Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Oppenheimer
Management Corp.'s senior executives agreed to acquire
Oppenheimer Management, a $14 billion mutual fund company,
from British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings PLC for approximately
$150 million.
   The acquisition, which will give MassMutual an 80% voting
interest in Oppenheimer Management, will set the life insurer
up as a major player in the mutual fund business. "We tried
growing {a mutual fund business} ourselves, but it's going to
take forever before we reach a significant size," said Thomas
B. Wheeler, chairman and chief executive officer of
Springfield, Mass.-based MassMutual. "But with $14 billion
under management, we've achieved the critical mass that we
need."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   British &amp; Commonwealth was forced to sell its U.S. unit
because it needed to raise $2 billion to pay debt. In April,
it was forced to write off about $900 million in losses at
another subsidiary, Atlantic Computers PLC. In early June,
the firm entered "administration," the U.K. equivalent of
Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   Oppenheimer and MassMutual are putting up about 50% of the
buy-out price and plan to finance the remainder.
Oppenheimer's senior managers are contributing $12 million of
equity capital for the buy-out.
   Some analysts said the $150 million price for Oppenheimer
was modest. But Jon S. Fossel, Oppenheimer's president and
chief executive, said $7 billion of the company's $14 billion
in assets consists of money market funds that Oppenheimer
manages for other concerns, including $6 billion for A.E.
Edwards &amp; Sons, the St. Louis-based brokerage firm.
Management fees for money market funds are usually slimmer
and transaction costs are higher than for traditional stock
funds, he said.
   Mr. Fossel said the accord between the two companies "is a
pretty neat marriage." Although Oppenheimer will be an
independent unit of the insurance company, he sees some
eventual joint activities for the two concerns. Oppenheimer
would like to sell variable annuities, and Mr. Fossel hopes
to tap into MassMutual's expertise and back-office operations
in these areas. MassMutual's 3,500 agents who are licensed to
sell mutual funds will have additional funds to sell. Right
now, they sell about 26 of Oppenheimer's 50 funds.
   Mr. Wheeler said the Oppenheimer acquisition will also put
MassMutual on an equal footing with some top life insurers
who already own investment management firm or mutual fund
companies. He said he expects the Oppenheimer business to
generate substantial revenue for MassMutual, which is the
11th largest life insurer in the U.S.
   MassMutual has a small family of funds with $350 million
in assets. Many of these funds will be eventually folded into
the Oppenheimer funds.

   BRUSSELS -- European Community Commission sources said the
EC may substantially cut production subsidies to the European
consortium Airbus Industrie to try to resolve a long dispute
with the U.S.
   The sources said commission negotiators, acting on behalf
of the four countries involved in the consortium -- Britain,
France, Spain and West Germany -- have offered to cut all
production subsidies on aircraft with more than 100 seats.
This category would include the Airbus 330 and 340 aircraft
that are at the heart of the dispute.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Figures weren't immediately available on the amount of the
subsidies covered by the EC offer.
   The U.S. trade delegation in Washington has indicated that
if the commission made such a move, it wouldn't take the
issue to the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
   The U.S.'s original deadline for resolving the dispute was
Tuesday, but now negotiations between the two sides are set
to continue.
   Sources say the commission is also offering to cut
subsidies for development costs by as much as 50%. The U.S.
wants no more than 35% of the costs subsidized.

   Saturday, Aug. 4, 3:05 p.m.-6:05 p.m. and 8 p.m.-1:05 a.m.
EDT, on TBS: Last weekend of the Goodwill Games. Saturday
competitions include gold-medal boxing; women's basketball
and hockey semifinals. Finals in women's figure skating and
men's volleyball in the evening. Sunday, 3:05 p.m.-6:05 p.m.:
Women's basketball, hockey and boxing finals. 8:05 p.m.-1:05
a.m. More boxing finals, judo, closing ceremonies. Caution:
If Montgomery Clift or some other film star appears on your
screen instead of the above-mentioned gymkhana, it's because
some cable systems, truckling to the public's demonstrable
lack of interest in sports as geopolitical sermon, will be
airing movies instead of the games.

   Sunday, Aug. 5, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on Arts &amp; Entertainment:
"Crew of the Enola Gay." A return to Hiroshima with some of
the air crew who dropped the bomb in August of 1945. Jaunty
men in their late 60s and 70s, the visitors are anxious and
awestruck as they arrive. Still, the very British narrator
has trouble concealing a note of supercilious distaste for
these Air Force veterans who calmly swallow dinner and talk
quietly among themselves and who clearly are, in the
narrator's view, insufficiently guilt-ridden. The narrator
problem aside, there is much here that is rivetingly
complicated as the unfailingly gracious Japanese welcome
these Americans. If nothing else this would be worth seeing
for the exchange between the veterans and some survivors of
radiation sickness, both for what is said and the infinite
suggestiveness of what is left unsaid.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Aug. 6, 8-9 pm EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and
times vary so check local listings): "Wild Man of China."
Alleged sightings of a half-human, apelike creature tempt two
American anthropologists on a journey through central China.
The trip is an education in a number of ways. One learns
something about medical standards in the People's Republic of
China, when an explorer needing medical treatment tries to
get a hospital doctor to see the wisdom of using a clean
hypodermic needle. But the trip up, or perhaps it is down,
the Yangtze to look for Wild Man, as he is fondly known, is
enchanting because Wild Man (said by one and all villagers to
have long red hair) clearly has picked a splendid part of
China to haunt. The scenes in the marketplaces and the
closeups of the townspeople who have never before seen
Westerners, are memorable. Wild Man is never found,
fortunately for him, and the 2,000-year-old hunt goes on.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Aug. 8, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Castro's Cuba:
Two Views." Two views indeed. One is from Cuban exile and
photography director Nestor Almendros ("Kramer vs. Kramer,"
"Sophie's Choice") and journalist Jorge Ulla. It shows
witness after witness to the torture and decades of
imprisonment Castro visited on dissidents. That torture took
place, they remind us, while progressive intellectuals and
literary types in the U.S. and elsewhere busied themselves
celebrating Castro, hence the title, "Nobody Listened." The
other film, "Uncompromising Revolution," is a worshipful
portrait of Castro's Cuba put together by Saul Landau of the
Institute for Policy Studies. In it we are privileged to see
pictures of baby Fidel, Fidel at school, and also pictures
galore of singing and happy Cubans. Indeed the film is cast
mainly with smiling and happy Cubans and happy children
singing, as happy livestock wander by. The Maximum Leader
himself also is merry. No viewer comparing this work with
Messrs. Almendros and Ulla's detailed documentation of horror
will have any trouble deciding which has the ring of truth.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Aug. 8, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Top Cops," a
superior documentary series about police, the appeal of which
derives from a good ear, unsensational re-enactments, and a
lack of pretension. Its creators appear to be aware that when
extraordinary experiences of ordinary people, like policemen,
are rendered in the way that those ordinary people actually
talk, the result can be powerful. A cop program in which
police talk like normal human beings rather than cosmopolitan
wits is to be cherished.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Aug. 13, 8-10 pm EDT, on TNT: "Heat Wave." A
singularly demagogic portrait of the 1965 Watts riots that
left 35 people dead, 30 of them black. It may be worth
watching as an example of just how much vicious stereotyping
it still is possible to get away with now, so long as the
stereotyping is directed at the right group. Here is a film
in which every black, without exception, is heroic, highly
sensitive, loving and family-minded. Every white, without
exception, is either a cold, vicious redneck, a selfish
hypocrite, infantile or cowardly. They used to call this sort

   Following is an editorial from last Friday's Bangkok Post.
It refers to the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting
held in Singapore earlier this week:

   The chief subject of corridor discussions at a conference
in Singapore this weekend on the economy of Pacific nations
will focus on Southeast Asia's longest-running war without
bloodshed. Singapore's tireless dispute with the foreign
Press has escalated again. The government has barred
reporters from the region's two leading economic publications
from covering the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation
conference. By keeping away The Asian Wall Street Journal and
the Far Eastern Economic Review, Singapore has assured
diluting serious discussion about the region's economy.
Delegates, including senior regional and international
ministers, will be debating and discussing the Press ban.
Indeed, it will be a major topic when U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker meets Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
   From a simple assertion of government rights, Singapore's
unrelenting pursuit of certain media and correspondents has
intensified to this. With their circulations severely
restricted, the two publications are effectively barred from
the vast majority of the Singapore public and visitors to the
Republic. The issue has consumed a large amount of Mr. Lee's
time and that of his deputy and appointed successor Goh Chok
Tong. The hard-line, no-compromise stance of Mr. Lee's
government has made Singapore appear petty in the eyes of
many. These certainly include many executives who do business
in, or with, the island republic.
   In all of this, the Press has become the underdog.
Predictably, it has gained much public sympathy, if not
outright support. By continuing its public battles with two
of the region's leading business publications, Singapore has
cast itself in the role of persecutor as well as prosecutor.
Neither of these is a role desirable for the Singapore
government in this instance.
   It is possible, certainly, to consider Singapore's
position in the dispute. Mr. Lee and his government maintain
they have the right to bar access to reporters of media they
consider unfriendly. Of course they do. But the disputes in
these cases have sunk to making picayune and obscure points.
The fact is that neither publication, for example, has called
for the ouster of the Singapore Government, let alone its
overthrow. The full-page advertisement {a reprint of an
editorial that ran in the Asian Journal July 23 explaining
the company's position} in Tuesday's Asian Wall Street
Journal left many readers wondering how two eminently
sensible organizations -- the newspaper and the Singapore
Government -- could be reduced to such bickering.
   They can be excused for asking if this is a tempest in a
teacup. Mr. Goh has made it clear that reporters from the
parent organizations of both publications may cover the
weekend conference. Only those employed specifically by their
Asian partners are banned. Thus, to many, it will seem that
there is neither a crime nor a punishment. The physical
barring of reporters is therefore more puzzling than ever.
   The Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference is a
major international meeting. Current practice in almost every
country, and quite correctly so, is to allow the Press to
cover such meetings. Singapore neither helps its own case
nor, in the end, the publications it seeks to punish. By
barring serious economic reporters from a serious economic
conference, the Singapore Government succeeds only in
appearing oppressive, hardly the judgment it seeks. That the
outside world cares little about the specific reasons for
such action only further hurts Singapore's image.
   Mr. Lee and Mr. Goh, both statesmen of the world class,
can perform better than this. Most governments in the world
have come to a truce, however uneasy, with foreign newsmen
without either giving up their own rights, or forcing
reporters to give up their claims to cover news as they and
their publications see fit. The Singapore Press dispute has
dragged on for years. Instead of seeking impossible redress
for events in a past long forgotten by the public, Singapore
might well consider calling a truce and looking to the future
in this matter. A fine, diplomatic beginning would be for
Singapore to make a quick reversal and allow reporters from
the two publications to attend this weekend's very important
meeting.

   OAK BROOK, Ill. -- CBI Industries Inc. said it is calling
for the redemption of its $85.4 million outstanding of 7%
convertible subordinated debentures due Oct. 30, 2011.
   The construction concern said the debentures will be
redeemed at $52.45 for each $50 principal amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest, for a total redemption price of $53.62.
</LP>

   CBI said the debentures are convertible into its common at
$34 a share, or 1.471 shares for each $50 principal amount.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, CBI closed at $41, down $1.125.
   If the debentures are fully converted into common, CBI
said, it will issue about 2.5 million shares. As of July 31,

   LOS ANGELES -- The star, director and producers of the hit
science-fiction film "Aliens" filed suit against Twentieth
Century Fox Film Corp., charging that the movie company
didn't pay them their fair share of the profit.
   The suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by
actress Sigourney Weaver, director James Cameron, producer
Gail Anne Hurd and executive producers Gordon Carroll, Walter
Hill and David Giler. They alleged that Fox failed to include
all the film's revenue in account statements and made
improper expense deductions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fox, a unit of Australia-based News Corp., also allegedly
set aside improper and excess reserves and provided
inaccurate accountings, the suit charged.
   The complaint seeks unspecified damages, a judicial
determination that the film is now in net profit and an
accounting. Ms. Weaver claims she was to receive 10% of the
1986 film's net profit. "Aliens" was the sequel to the 1979
science fiction hit, "Alien," about monsters in deep space.
   A spokesman for Fox said the company had no comment on the
suit.

   WASHINGTON -- Speaker Thomas Foley, in a strongly worded
statement to the full House, condemned the "terror tactics"
of the Irish Republican Army and "cowardly murder" of Ian
Gow, a British conservative killed this week by a bomb
planted in his car.
   "The clear and despicable purpose of this callous act was
intimidation through terror," said the Washington State
Democrat, who broke with custom by speaking from the well of
the House immediately after the chamber convened yesterday.
Surprised by the speaker's appearance, members sat in unusual
silence but then rose in applause at the conclusion of his
remarks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The IRA's guns and bombs have not brought independence
for Northern Ireland, nor will they," said Mr. Foley, one of
the most prominent Irish-American officeholders in the U.S.
"What they have brought -- in the years since British troops
were sent to Northern Ireland in 1972 -- is the deaths of
many more civilian bystanders than of soldiers or policemen,
the deaths of many more Catholics than Protestants, in fact,
many more deaths than can be attributed to the British."
   A supporter of the 1985 Anglo-Irish accord giving the
Republic of Ireland a consultative role in the governing of
Northern Ireland, Mr. Foley has disagreed with Mr. Gow on a
number of Irish issues. But he was described as deeply
affected by the killing and the threat it posed to
Parliament.

   Battle for Control

   LA JOLLA, Calif. -- Despite a restructuring plan and
management shake-up announced by Pic 'N' Save Corp., Girard
Partners L.P., an investor group controlled by David H.
Batchelder, said it will continue its battle for control.
   Girard, which holds 6.7% of the discount retailer's common
stock, said it will resume its solicitation of proxies to
elect its nominees to a majority of seats on the company's
board at the Aug. 29 annual meeting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Girard also said that it intends to purchase additional
shares of Pic 'N' Save common in the open market and
privately negotiated transactions.
   Some analysts think Mr. Batchelder's chances to win the
proxy fight aren't good. "Unless he comes up with a program
that is more attractive than management's, his chances are
slim," said Barry Rothberg, an analyst at Mabon, Nugent &amp;
Co., a New York investment firm. "Management's restructuring
plan was reasonably well-received by investors."
   Pic 'N' Save stock closed at $10.625 a share, up 62.5
cents, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   Pic 'N' Save, which specializes in close-out merchandise,
said Tuesday that it had been in discussions with Girard to
try to find a way to avoid resumption of a proxy fight but
that Girard's demands were unacceptable to the board. These
demands included a proposal for a "reconstituted board,"
according to the Girard SEC filing. Mr. Batchelder didn't
return a telephone call asking him what he thought of Pic 'N'
Save's new plan.
   That plan would cut costs and resume a $60 million stock
buy-back program in an effort to placate shareholders. The
Dominguez, Calif., company also announced the resignation of
its chairman, president and chief executive officer, Lewis
Merrifield III, who had been under fire for increasing
expenses and overexpansion. The moves appeared to meet most
of the demands of the Batchelder group.
   Mr. Batchelder, a former protege of T. Boone Pickens, the
Texas-based takeover specialist, still hasn't made a profit
on his investment in Pic 'N' Save. "His cost is $10.80 a
share and that doesn't include his legal, administrative and
proxy solicitation costs," Mr. Rothberg said.

   DETROIT'S BUILDING 'EM but who's buying?
   Auto makers boost production in hopes of higher
second-half sales, but sharp price hikes may deter buyers.
After cutting output by 14% in the first half, car makers
(including Japanese who build in the U.S.) schedule a 10%
increase for the third quarter. The Big Three insist they
don't anticipate a UAW strike in September. Instead, they
note first-half cuts simply returned bulging inventories to
normal, making it possible to boost output now. Still,
second-half industrywide sales "will go up very modestly,"
says Ford's David N. McCammon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ford predicts an annual sales rate of 14.6 million
vehicles in the current half, up a bit from the first half's
14.3 million pace. But sticker shock could jolt consumers.
Chrysler may boost minivan prices as much as 12%, and Ford
wants to hike the price of the least expensive Taurus by
$1,077, or 8.5%. The Japanese, who took a record 28% of car
sales in the first half, could benefit. Although the dollar's
been sliding, it's still stronger against the yen than at the
start of the year. So, advantage: Japanese, in pricing
flexibility.
   Autos, which account for about 5% of GNP, bedevil economic
forecasters who try to decipher demand.
                                                                                                       

   GATOR RAIDING'S on the mind of Coke, Pepsi. So far, they
only take sips.
   Quaker's Gatorade guzzled 96% of the $475 million "energy
drink" market last year, says David Weiss of Packaged Facts,
New York. But now Pepsi's a contender with lightly carbonated
Mountain Dew Sport. Coke competes in a special arena, selling
PowerAde only at convenience store fountains. Coke's
non-carbonated drink in lemon, fruit punch and orange flavors
"targets primarily males" who do physical labor or exercise,
says a spokesman. Quaker extends the line with women in mind,
offering low-calorie Gatorade this spring.
   The stakes are high. Packaged Facts expects sales of
sports beverages to grow about 15% annually, reaching $1.1
billion by 1995. Do they work? A recent Medical Letter item
on heat injury notes runners should drink 100-300 milliliters
(about 250 is a cup) of water, or a solution like Gatorade,
10 to 15 minutes before a race and a cup or so every three to
four kilometers. Yes, it's OK to drink during exercise. Note:
the letter indicates water is a quite acceptable drink to
replace fluids lost during strenuous exercise.
                                                                                                       

   SURETY BOND SQUEEZE hurts many small and minority-owned
contractors.
   New federal rules crack down on inadequately financed
entrepreneurs who back construction bonds. But the change
dries up a key source of performance and payment bonds for
many firms that can't meet big insurers' standards.
Minority-owned firms, like Marenco Inc. of Anchorage, Alaska,
are especially hard hit. "It's been like a pail of cold
water," says Jose Angel Marks Cisneros, president. Last year,
his firm won $2.5 million in contracts. This year? Less than
$150,000. Comstock Construction, Evanston, Ill., lays off 50
workers. "There's no sense in bidding on anything" bonded,
says President Edgar Garcia-Smoot.
   Eyeing opportunity, big insurers offer bonds to small
builders -- at premiums double or triple rates paid by big
contractors. Meanwhile, support mounts in Washington to
rebuild the individual-surety industry. One proposed bill now
in committee would create federally approved "risk pools,"
which would broaden access to bonds while weeding out
undercapitalized individuals.
   Surety bonds are required on most government work. More
private firms and homeowners demand them, too.
                                                                                                       

   STOP THIEF] Knogo Corp., Hauppauge, N.Y., installs

   MALAISE ON MAIN STREET. Downtown retailers combat
difficult odds.
   Even the most affluent small towns and suburbs are
affected. "America is overstored today," says Marvin
Blumenfeld of April-Blumenfeld Co., a consulting firm. On
Main Street "merchants are small and have a tendency not to
cooperate with each other," says Mr. Blumenfeld. That can add
to problems in a troubled industry. Statistics are hard to
come by, but the credit crunch is thought to exacerbate
vacancy rates in small downtowns. Meanwhile, malls can offer
"deals" such as $100,000 for inventory, or several months'
free rent.
   Stan Cohn, manager of retail services for Cushman &amp;
Wakefield in San Francisco, says time takes its toll, too.
"The buildings are functionally obsolete" for modern
retailing, he says. Bright spots: the Downtown Idea Exchange
cites day care centers, joint merchant plans, specialty
shops.
   Utica, N.Y., buys a classic Woolworth building to convert
and lease as office space to keep a big employer.

   IBM to Set Up Office Products Business
   As Separate Line, Clearing Way to Sale

   International Business Machines Corp. said it will set up
its office products business as a separate operation,
preparing the way for its sale to Clayton &amp; Dubilier in a
leveraged buy-out.
   Although financial details weren't disclosed, industry
executives estimated the price at nearly $2.3 billion --
roughly in line with earlier reports that IBM planned to sell
the business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the business is of modest size by the computer
giant's standards, the typewriter, keyboard, printer and
office-supply operations being spun off would fit in the top
half of the Fortune 500 list, with revenue of $2.5 billion to
$3 billion. Their disposal will enable IBM, which had 1989
revenue of about $63 billion, to cut its head count by nearly
6,000 -- with roughly 5,000 people moving to the new company
and 1,200 jobs being eliminated.
   Those cuts indicate that IBM is increasingly serious about
trimming costs and employees in order to focus on its core
computer business. It has already cut employment by about
30,000 in recent years to fewer than 380,000 people, but this
is the first time IBM has disposed of a business such as
typewriters that has been so central to its history.
   In the process, IBM is tacitly acknowledging that it isn't
as efficient a manufacturer as it thought it was. It had
spent $350 million in the mid-1980s to modernize the facility
in Lexington, Ky., where most of these products are made and
had held up the plant as an example of how U.S. companies
could match Japanese manufacturing expertise. But industry
executives said that a recent study by IBM found that it
still couldn't make products as cheaply as competitors. While
profitable, the businesses don't generate the returns that
IBM gets on its computer lines and aren't considered
strategic so IBM decided to dispense with them.
   IBM, in Armonk, N.Y., said it won't take a charge related
to the job reductions, because it already allowed for this
possibility as part of a $2.4 billion write-down it took in
the 1989 fourth quarter. It indicated it could eventually
have a gain related to the sale but wouldn't break it out as
a separate item and said any gain wouldn't be material.
   In the absence of any clear effect on IBM financial
statements, IBM's stock price moved little; it closed at
$111.625, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   IBM was vague on many details of its plans, saying it had
signed only preliminary agreements with Clayton &amp; Dubilier.
IBM said it is setting up its U.S. office products operations
as a separate business and hopes to sell a majority stake to
Clayton &amp; Dubilier. IBM also said it is considering including
its overseas office products operations in the new company.
IBM said it will retain some equity in the business, but
didn't specify the amount or say what it expected to be paid
for the rest of the business.
   Industry executives said they expect IBM to keep a 15% to
20% stake in the new company, with Clayton &amp; Dubilier
acquiring the rest. Clayton &amp; Dubilier would then allocate
15% of the equity to the new company's employees and top
management, led by IBM vice president Marvin Mann, who will
become the new company's chief executive officer.
   Most buy-outs concentrate equity ownership in the hands of
a few top executives. The proposed IBM deal, however, would
give stock-appreciation rights to all employees of the new
company. That would give them at least a small share of
whatever profits the buy-out eventually yields.
   IBM said it will try to get 1,200 people to quit their
jobs in Lexington by offering incentives to the 4,400 people
there who are involved in the office products businesses --
roughly 1,000 at the site are involved in other businesses
and aren't affected. The incentives are similar to ones IBM
has offered in the past and are generous -- as much as two
years' salary plus $25,000 and continuation of some benefits.
   As often happens these days with IBM battling to break out
of a five-year earnings lull, the job cuts raised concerns
that IBM was shedding its tradition of no layoffs. But an IBM
spokesman said no one will be forced to quit. He said the new
company is expected to maintain IBM's values, presumably
meaning that layoffs would be a last resort, if any are ever
ordered.
   IBM said 200 to 250 people in Boulder, Colo., also will be
assigned to the new company. The rest of the 5,000 people in
the new company will come from overseas and from hiring that
will be done to beef up marketing.
   IBM will be by far the biggest customer for the new
company and will sell the midrange printers under its own
name. The new company also will be able to use the IBM logo
on its products, although that right will be phased out in
coming years as the new company begins to use its own
name-which has yet to be determined.
   IBM has made similar arrangements in recent years as it
has tried to become more focused. Last year, it sold most of
its large Rolm telecommunications business to Siemens AG of
West Germany, and just in the past month it announced a plan
to sell most of its automated-teller-machine business into a
joint venture with Diebold Inc.
   The office products spinoff "is just, I think, an
extension of the kinds of things we've been doing," IBM
Chairman John F. Akers said in an interview.
   Mr. Akers said IBM will continue to keep the pressure on
costs because the market is so competitive, but added that
"we're very encouraged by the results we've had so far" this
year. "We're performing as we've expected to perform."

   USX Expects Rise
   In Steel Shipments
   During 2nd Half

   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp. Chairman Charles A. Corry said he
expects increased company steel shipments and higher steel,
crude oil and natural gas prices in the second half of 1990.
   Separately, he disclosed that USX will become 20%-owner of
a 148-mile pipeline in the North Sea, which will transport
natural gas from the company's Brae fields to the United
Kingdom. Those fields contain an estimated 2.3 trillion cubic
feet of gas, of which USX owns about 900 billion cubic feet.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Corry said USX's steel shipments in the second half
would reach about 5.8 million tons, or slightly more than the
5.5 million tons of steel it shipped in the first half. He
attributed the anticipated rise to stronger automotive orders
and strength in the tin-plate market.
   Industrywide shipments, he said, are expected to be about
83 million tons this year compared with about 84 million tons
in 1989. Steelmakers originally thought 1990 shipments would
reach only about 80 million tons.
   The company's steel business also should benefit from
stronger pricing. USX reported a 1% increase in steel prices
in the first half from year-earlier levels, but that slight
increase reflected a richer mix of products, rather than
higher average prices. Indeed, Mr. Corry noted that prices
drifted downward by about $10 to $12 a ton from January to
June, and that steel is selling at the same price as 10 years
ago, or an average of about $500 a ton.
   Prices should pick up in the second half, he said, as a
result of increases on certain steel products beginning with
July 1 shipments.
   In spite of a 48% decline in first-half steel operating
earnings, Mr. Corry said that USX's steel segment was well
positioned in its primary markets. The steel segment had
operating profit of $140 million on sales of $2.7 billion in
the first half.
   Regarding the possible sale of steel assets, Mr. Corry
said USX has had discussions with British Steel PLC but that
no specific proposal was made. As for other negotiations, Mr.
Corry would only say that a company the size of USX is always
in discussions but that nothing was "monumental."
   As for the energy segment, Mr. Corry noted that crude oil
prices averaged about $16 to $18 a barrel in the first half
and should increase in the second half. That would help the
company's upstream operations, which include exploration and
production. Natural-gas prices, which were hurt by a warm
first quarter, likewise should be better in the second half
with the beginning of cooler weather.
   Separately, Mr. Corry said talks with the United
Steelworkers of America regarding the Jan. 31, 1990, contract
expiration are scheduled to begin in December. The
negotiations are expected to be tough, given the company's
criticism of pacts signed by competitors last year and
reluctance to recognize any pattern contract.
   He said both the union and the company were hurt by a
strike in 1986. "That's not something I want to repeat," he
said. "I hope we approach new bargaining with new wisdom."

   NEW YORK -- Prime Motor Inns Inc. shares have taken a
battering in the last two days, as the hotel company
continues to seek to reduce debt by selling assets.
   Prime Motor shares have fallen 23% since Monday, closing
down 50 cents at $5.125 a share in composite trading
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The shares had closed at $6.625 a share on Monday.
   The Fairfield, N.J., company issued a statement at the Big
Board's request, saying there were no corporate developments
to account for the trading activity.
   A year ago, the company's shares were trading around $38 a
share. But it found itself facing a heavy debt load from
acquisitions as well as the inabililty of FCD Hospitality
Inc. to repay about $200 million of borrowings from Prime.
   Prime Motor yesterday said a bank credit agreement had
become effective, folding $60 million of unsecured loans into
a collateralized bank lending facility that matures next
March. The company said it has reduced bank debt to $110
million and its balance sheet restructuring is on schedule.
   Analysts noted there is a hefty short position in the
stock by investors who expect the price to go lower. Prime is
a $5 stock "partly because of concern about the quality of
earnings," as well as weak hotel space demand and a soft real
estate market, said Margo L. Vignola, an analyst with Salomon
Brothers Inc.

   Chargeurs to Buy Pathe for $207.3 Million

   Move Ends Battle for Control

   PARIS -- Pathe Cinema S.A., France's oldest film company
and focus of a two-year battle for control, will remain
French.
   Chargeurs S.A., a textiles and communications concern,
said it will pay 1.1 billion French francs ($207.3 million)
for Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti's 47% direct stake
in Pathe Cinema and for a further 52% held by Banque Rivaud.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The film company, which owns 150 cinemas in France, a
library including French film classics and vintage newsreel,
has been the focus of a long-running saga featuring
high-finance and politics. French officials had said that
France should maintain control of its own cultural history
and patrimony, as represented by the Pathe archives.
   Earlier this year French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy
blocked, for the second time, Banque Rivaud's agreement to
sell its Pathe Cinema stake to Mr. Parretti, arguing that it
could "disrupt public order." Mr. Beregovoy didn't elaborate
how it would threaten public order, but Finance Ministry
officials later said the minister was concerned that the
origin of Mr. Parretti's funds couldn't be traced.
   Mr. Parretti and his allies contend the money came from
successful business transactions, including several hotel
sales in Sicily.
   Salvatore Picciotto, Mr. Parretti's Paris representative,
said in a telephone interview yesterday that his group was
forced to sell its Pathe stake because of France's refusal to
negotiate. He said the group plans to pursue legal
proceedings in France and in the European Court against the
French government. "We want justice," Mr. Picciotto said,
accusing Mr. Beregovoy of blocking the agreement with Banque
Rivaud because "we are not part of the French establishment."
   Mr. Parretti's designs on Pathe were a major element in
his plans to extend his movie empire, which already counts
about 700 cinemas in Europe. Mr. Parretti also is seeking
control of MGM/UA Communications Co. in the U.S. Earlier this
year he agreed to pay $1.3 billion in a proposed merger
between MGM/UA and Pathe Communications Corp.
   Pathe Communications, which is legally unrelated to Pathe
Cinema S.A., was formed out of Cannon Group Inc. and its
European cinema network. Mr. Parretti bought Cannon three
years ago from film makers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus.
   The planned merger with MGM/UA, already delayed several
times because of financing questions, ran into even greater
trouble in June. Time Warner Inc., which had agreed to put up
half of the $1.3 billion, pulled out of its agreement with
Pathe, citing breach of contract. Time Warner and Pathe
currently have law suits pending against each other.
   A Chargeurs official strongly denied that the French
government had asked the company to step in to save Pathe
Cinema. "There was absolutely no government pressure," he
said, adding that other French groups had also been
interested in Pathe.
   "Pathe Cinema will complete what we have already started,"
the Chargeurs official said. "And we won't stop there," he
added, although he declined to identify any targets for
future expansion.
   Charguer Chairman Jerome Seydoux's first foray into media
in 1986 was cut short less than a year later when the new
right-wing government revoked Chargeurs's license to run the
television channel La Cinq.
   Although Mr. Seydoux recovered a stake in La Cinq in 1988
following a change of government, he sold out last May after
losing a boardroom battle against publisher Robert Hersant.
In January, Chargeurs sold its airline Union des Transports
Aeriens to Air France, ending a long battle for new routes
against the national flagcarrier.
   The sale of UTA and La Cinq raised about two billion
francs in cash for Chargeurs, clearing the way for
acquisitions.
   In the last few years Mr. Seydoux has refocused Chargeurs,
selling off all its shipping and transport activities and
buying into textiles, cinema, satellites and television.
   The group already has a 50% stake in French film
production house Renn Productions, as well as film
distribution company AMLF. It also has interests in two new
direct broadcast satellite channels, British Satellite
Broadcasting (BSB) in the U.K. and Sport 2-3 in France.

   Casino Revenue
   In Atlantic City
   Was Flat in July

   Despite the addition of $40.5 million in July gambling
revenue from the new Trump Taj Mahal, the Atlantic City
casino industry saw a growth of only 0.7% last month compared
with a year earlier. The preliminary July results, released
by the Casino Association of New Jersey, wiped out hopes that
the Taj would permanently increase the size of the gambling
market.
   "The market is dead flat and the overall industry in New
Jersey is struggling," acknowledged Thomas Carver, president
of the association.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue at the Trump Castle plunged 28% from a year ago to
$21.4 million, the steepest decline among the city's 12
casinos; the Trump Plaza's revenue dropped almost 24% to
$23.4 million. These sharp drops suggest that the Taj
continues to cannibalize Trump's other gambling properties.
   Elsewhere in city, revenue at Bally's Grand dropped 20% to
$18.5 million; Harrah's plunged 17% to $24.2 million;
Tropworld fell 16% to $26.5 million; Resorts was down 12% to
$21.2 million; Bally's Park Place dropped 11% to $25.7
million; the Showboat's revenue fell 7.8% to $23.6 million;
and Caesars slipped 6.8% to $30.5 million.
   The only casinos to register increases were the Claridge,
where revenue jumped 13% to $13.3 million, and the Sands,
where revenue edged up 2% to $21.6 million.
   "We are very discouraged by the less than 1% growth in
casino gross revenues," said Mr. Carver, adding: "The
decrease in gross revenues for most casinos coupled with
increased operating expenses spells double trouble."
   Pointing out that the association's July figures were
based on projections from actual revenue through July 28, Al
Glasgow, a gambling industry consultant, predicted that when
the final July figures are tabulated, the industry will show
either flat revenue or a slight decline.

   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp in June
dropped 15% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
80% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 500,000 metric tons of
market pulp in June, compared with 590,000 tons a year
earlier. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The June operating rate of 80% was down from 85% in May
and from 96% a year earlier.
   For the six months through June, Canadian mills produced
3,251,000 metric tons of market pulp, a 9.1% decline from
3,578,000 tons a year earlier. The industry operated at 86%
of capacity in the first half, down from 97% a year earlier.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp.
   Total market shipments in June dropped 19% to 510,000
metric tons from 632,000 tons a year earlier. Shipments to
all markets were down.
   Market shipments in the first half dropped 14% to
3,038,000 metric tons from 3,549,000 tons a year earlier.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of June totaled
573,000 metric tons, a 35-day supply, compared with 583,000
tons, a 35-day supply, at the end of May, and 268,000 tons, a
13-day supply, at the end of June 1989.

   It is well known to readers of this newspaper that before
you fully commit a company's name to a new consumer product,
you test-market it. George Bush has spent about three months
test-marketing a new consumer product called Tax Revenue
Increases. So far, the one thing we know for sure about Tax
Revenue Increases is that Washington's Democrats think it's
the greatest thing since Coca-Cola introduced New Coke.
   The label on the can claims that if you pour the stuff on
the federal budget, by morning the deficit will have shrunk,
the fed funds rate will drop 150 basis points, markets will
revive and GNP growth will spurt upward. Having drunk deeply
from this new formula, the Democrats want Mr. Bush to get out
front and sell the wondrous concoction to the American
people. Well, it now appears that after watching the
Democrats behavior under the influence of Tax Revenue
Increases, Mr. Bush may be having second thoughts about
betting his presidency on its sales potential.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A few years ago, Coca-Cola Co. pulled off a stunning
marketing success with its about-face restoration of Classic
Coke when the public revolted at its abandonment of Coke's
original formula. A few days ago, Congressman Newt Gingrich
suggested that Mr. Bush regroup behind something called
"Republican Classic" -- an original partisan formula of
resisting both new taxes and new spending.
   The news out of Washington yesterday suggested that Mr.
Bush is indeed mulling a new marketing strategy for the
budget summit. He can continue to be "nondivisive," pursuing
a budget deal with the Democrats. Or he can get partisan
during Congress's August recess and start using the
President's bully pulpit to berate the Democrats for offering
no concrete spending cuts, threaten a sequester and promise
vetoes of the ever-higher spending bills being passed on
Capitol Hill. We hope Mr. Bush pursues the latter strategy.
   One immediate benefit of the President using the bully
pulpit is that it would give the American people an
all-too-rare understanding of where the White House stands on
a major public-policy issue. Yesterday, for instance, the
White House apparently was upset that following a breakfast
with some 150 congressional Republicans, Mr. Gingrich went
out on the driveway and put too hard a spin on Mr. Bush's
frustration with the Democrats' summit negotiators. White
House press secretary Roman Popadiuk then gave a press
briefing to soften the Gingrich spin.
   The White House mightn't have to worry about whether its
friends are misinterpreting its intentions if it made its
intentions clearer. That sort of clarity is one of the
benefits of partisan politics. Up to now, the administration
has seemed determined to make the budget summit an exercise
in "responsible government." It's easy to sympathize with the
administration's strategy; the Democrats control both houses
of Congress and no reform of the spending machine will pass
without some Democratic support. So you negotiate, as the
White House says, "in good faith."
   No doubt Mr. Bush's goals are worth pursuing: gain lasting
institutional control over federal spending, reassure the
markets that we still have rational government, achieve a
downward slope for the deficit, reinvigorate presidential
authority in the budget process, cut the capital gains tax
and reignite the economy. But at some point you have to stand
back from the negotiations and ask yourself if the Democrats
share any of these goals, or whether their agenda is off on
another track.
   This week, for instance, House Democrats passed a defense
bill that virtually sequesters the Pentagon and makes the
office of the Secretary of Defense barely relevant. Their
already-enacted domestic appropriations bills are pumping up
federal spending well beyond the rising tax revenues coming
into the Treasury. And it seems obvious that one of the
party's big goals for the budget summit is to achieve some
sort of soak-the-rich tax increase that presumably will help
win back the Reagan Democrats who keep putting Republicans in
the White House. What does any of this have in common with
the administration's views of responsible government?
   By all means let's dedicate the dog days of August to a
round of political partisanship over the direction of the
federal budget. One of the growing political problems of our
time is that the public is beginning to view Washington as
essentially "them," a congealed glob of indistinguishable
politicians who cause problems like the S&amp;L mess or runaway
federal spending. The behind-closed-doors budget deal,
whatever its high intentions, runs the risk of contributing
to this corrosive cynicism.
   If there are fundamental philosophical disputes between
Republicans and Democrats over taxes and spending, let's get
them out where the public can see them. That's what a
democracy is for. Come September, Mr. Bush may have concluded
that it really is time to bring back his own version of
Coca-Cola Classic.

   Four Indicators for Stock Market
   Appear to Be Calling for Caution

   The stock market's retreat from record territory has left
many investors hungry for clues: Is this just a pause in a
continuing upward climb, or are stock prices really in for a
slide?
   No one can say for sure, of course, but this could be a
good time to step back from the market's day-to-day gyrations
and take a look at some widely watched indicators. These
measures -- financial ratios, trading patterns and the like
-- have traditionally been viewed as stock-market signposts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The gauges aren't perfect. Market professionals frequently
disagree on how to interpret a particular reading. And many
of the indicators are "far from reliable," said Alfred
Goldman, director of market analysis for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons
in St. Louis.
   Still, the indicators can be useful in evaluating the
market in light of longer-term trends. While these measures
won't tell what stock prices are going to do tomorrow, they
may help investors cut back their stock holdings when the
market is vulnerable and increase their exposure when the
risks are lower. The whole idea is to "play the
probabilities," said Gerald Perritt, a Chicago newsletter
editor and money manager.
   Here's a guide to four popular indicators that several
analysts say are now flashing caution signals:
                                                                                                       

   PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO: This common ratio for evaluating
whether an individual stock is cheap or expensive is also
applied to the broader market. The current level of a market
index, typically the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, is
divided by the past 12 months' per-share earnings of the
companies in the index. A high market P-E means stocks are
highly priced relative to corporate earnings and, thus,
possibly poised for a tumble. Investors can keep an eye on
the P-E for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
in this newspaper each Monday.
   At the moment, the P-E for the S&amp;P 500 is about 16. While
that's still well below the P-E ratios of 20 or more that
have often preceded major declines, it is above the long-term
average of about 13. And it is far higher than the P-Es of 7
or 8 that have often accompanied market troughs.
   When the ratio exceeds 15, the stock market "is starting
to get pricey," said Arnold Kaufman, editor of Outlook, a
newsletter published by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. That's
particularly true when corporate-earnings prospects are less
than robust, as they are now, he said. "You don't want to
bail out at these levels, but you do want to keep an eye on
developments."
                                                                                                       

   DIVIDEND YIELD: Another way analysts gauge the
reasonableness of stock prices is by comparing prices to the
dividend income stockholders receive. The key figure is the
"dividend yield" of the S&amp;P 500, the annualized dividend
income provided by the underlying stocks as a percentage of
the index level. The S&amp;P-500 yield is also published in this
newspaper on Mondays.
   The current S&amp;P yield is about 3.4%. Like the market P-E,
that's a lot closer to a sell signal than it is to a buy
sign. "Whenever that thing has gone below 3%, the market has
invariably sold off," said Mr. Perritt, the Chicago editor
and money manager. The last time was in 1987.
   The indicator has averaged about 4.5% over the past
several decades. A dividend yield of 5% or 6% is generally
considered a buying opportunity.
   Mr. Perritt said the current dividend yield is giving the
same message as the market P-E: "There is not huge cause for
concern, but the market may be topping." He has been advising
investors to pare back their stock-market exposure. But he
also notes that stocks have sometimes traded at clearly
"overvalued" levels for an extended period before falling.
                                                                                                       

   MARKET BREADTH: You could call this one "the Dow Jones
Industrial Average vs. the rest of the stock-market world."
Various ways to measure "breadth" show that the climb in the
30-stock Dow Jones average over the past year wasn't
accompanied by a comparable advance in the broader stock
market.
   That lack of breadth "is a classic warning sign," said Mr.
Goldman of A.G. Edwards. "Either the broad market pulls those
selected winners down, or the generals pull the troops up.
What usually happens is the broad market wins."
   One of the easiest ways for investors to monitor breadth
is to compare the percentage changes over time of various
market indexes. While the Dow Jones average has climbed 10%
over the past 12 months, the S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 3.6%,
and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks has
declined 3.3%.
   Market analysts mostly focus on the divergence between the
Dow and the "advance-decline line" for issues traded on the
New York Stock Exchange. Despite a rally this spring, that
measure is down from a year ago. That says the daily declines
in individual Big Board stocks have outnumbered the gains
over the past year.
   Investors can easily chart the advance-decline line:
Subtract today's declining issues from advancing ones to get
a net change. Starting with any base number, add or subtract
the change; repeat daily.
                                                                                                       

   TRADING VOLUME: "Volume tells you the conviction behind a
move," said Gail Dudack, a market analyst at S.G. Warburg &amp;
Co. And as the Dow climbed toward 3000, she said, "volume was
not convincing."
   Ms. Dudack said she would be more bullish about the Dow if
daily trading volume on the Big Board had remained
consistently above 200 million shares as the average made its
recent move from 2900 toward 3000. "We had a couple of good
volume days," she said, "but it wasn't sustained."
   Robert Farrell, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., said this is the first time since 1972, a cyclical peak
in stock prices, that record prices haven't been "confirmed"
by record trading volume. He focuses on the month-by-month
averages of daily volume on the New York exchange. The figure
was 154 million shares in June, the most recent month for
which data is available; that's also about the average for
the first half of the year.
   In contrast, the average daily trading volume was 193
million shares in August 1987, and it was 180 million or more
for several months that year.

   Marketing:
   New `Pop Art' Museum Promotes Coke

   ATLANTA -- After decades of collecting dust in storage,
some 1,000 items of Coke memorabilia go on display tomorrow
in a new museum here. On one wall, a 1908 ad shows that, even
before Maxwell House, Coca-Cola was "Good to the Last Drop."
Nearby, another turn-of-the century ad pitches the
short-lived Coca-Cola cigars.
   Coke estimates that as many as half-a-million people a
year will spin the turnstiles at the World of Coca-Cola, its
three-story, $15 million monument to itself.

<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co. museum is the latest -- and perhaps most
ambitious -- example of the growing use of corporate
historical exhibits as promotional tools. Seeking fresh ways
to reach an advertising-bombarded public, companies are
converting themselves into nothing less than tourist
attractions through a confluence of marketing, education and
entertainment.
   "People are beginning again to use their plants, factories
and headquarters as sales tools," says Bruce Weindruch,
founder of the History Factory in Washington, which
chronicles corporate histories and designs documentaries and
exhibits. Even though corporate museums are "blatant
advertising," adds Felice Jo Lamden of Lynch Museum Services,
a Pennsauken, N.J., consultant, "It is more palatable because
it is educational."
   Corporate museums aren't new, of course. Hershey Foods
Corp., Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. and Anheuser-Busch Cos.,
among others, have had popular museums or tours for decades.
There has been a bit of a reversal on plant tours, however,
as worries about legal liabilities and industrial espionage
led to closings of tours by companies like Gerber Products
Co. this year, and Kellogg Co. four years ago.
   Quantifying the current trend is difficult, but clearly
the interest level has grown recently. So far this year, the
History Factory has designed five major corporate exhibits --
the most in any of its 10 years. In February, more than 100
people from a variety of companies attended a business-museum
conference in Wilmington, Del., titled "Selling History? How
and Why Corporations Interpret the Past." And, responding to
demand, Victor Danilov, a retired president of Chicago's
Museum of Science and Industry, next year expects to publish
a how-to book on designing corporate museums.
   Later this year, Motorola Inc. will parade employees,
suppliers and schoolchildren through an immense museum that
will chronicle its decades of developing radios, TVs and
semiconductor chips. At the historical society museum in
York, Pa., tourists can find a century's worth of Pfaltzgraff
Co.'s pottery products in an exhibition hall, titled
"Pfaltzgraff, America's Potter." At its headquarters in New
York, Sterling Drug Inc. just opened an exhibit on its
history, which includes a 1918 box of Bayer aspirin powder.
   And since late last year, 11 American Security Bank
branches in the Washington, D.C., area have had indoor
exhibits tying the history of each branch to the local
neighborhood. Automatic teller machines display historical
trivia, including, for example, how some of the banks earlier
this century had ladies' departments where women could get
freshly minted cash and coins to avoid soiling their white
gloves.
   There are at least 100 corporate museums in the U.S.,
according to Mr. Danilov's research, and another 125
overseas, where Japan leads with 34. Tossing in places like
visitors' centers at utility plants, and corporate-sponsored
art galleries, the total in the U.S. is more than 200. Most
involve some description of a company's history, goals and
values, along with a sprinkling of artifacts. Says Mr.
Danilov: "No two are the same."
   Corporate museums are frequently housed in a headquarters
building or a major plant, and are free to the public. But
some companies send exhibits on tour. For several years, RJR
Nabisco Inc. has circulated to state museums a collection of
paintings used in early 1900s advertisements for Cream of
Wheat cereal and Ritz crackers, among other products.
   The Coca-Cola museum is a free-standing building, near
Atlanta's Underground nightlife and shopping area. Even
though there is a $2.50 admission charge and a gift shop with
Coca-Cola clothes and toys, the company says the museum isn't
a profitmaking venture.
   Inside is everything from the 1887 patent application for
a product listed as "Coca-Cola Syrup and Extract" to the
company's well-known trays and cardboard cutouts, with
celebrities like Jean Harlow and Cary Grant pitching Coke.
   People can walk inside eight-foot tall Coca-Cola cans to
watch brief movies on Coke's history. Machines dispense
several of Coke's exotic drinks from around the world, such
as a tutti-frutti drink sold in Costa Rica. A high-tech
fountain machine fires thin streams of Coca-Cola 20 feet
through the air.
   Glitz aside, the museum offers a rare glimpse at the
company's early struggle to lure consumers to a new drink
with an odd name, Coca-Cola. Initially, it was pitched as
something of a miracle elixir. "Cures the worst headache,"
says one ad. "The wonderful nerve &amp; brain tonic and
remarkable therapeutic agent," says another.
   In some ways, what the museum doesn't have is almost as
interesting as what it does, underscoring the difficulty
companies may have in presenting their history objectively.
There is, for example, no reference to cocaine. The company
has denied that the drug was ever in its drink, but that
lingering legend is arguably a real part of Coca-Cola lore.
(The "Coca-Cola" name was derived from two of the drink's
ingredients, flavoring extracts from both the coca leaf, from
which cocaine can be produced, and the cola nut.)
   What's more, with three floors and thousands of words and
images on the history of Coke, there's not one mention of
Pepsi-Cola Co., its main competitor. Granted, Coke did foot
the bill for the museum. But by most accounts, Pepsi has had
a big impact on the direction of Coca-Cola's history,
especially in forcing Coke into its greatest marketing
fiasco, the 1985 introduction of a reformulated Coca-Cola.
   Philip Mooney, Coca-Cola's archivist, says the museum does
indeed offer an objective history. "Cocaine has never been an
ingredient, and the whole history of that is pretty well
undocumented." On Pepsi, he says, "Essentially we were
focusing on our company, not focusing on other influences in
the marketplace. It's really a story, a case study, of a
consumer product and how it has interfaced with consumers
over 104 years. We could have chosen to tell other stories .
. . but we leave it to others to tell the cola war stories."
   Compared to a nearby wall that enshrines Coke's classic
Santa Claus ads, New Coke is treated more like a historical
footnote. A can of New Coke is in a display case next to a
can of the original formula drink, which was reintroduced in
a stunning about-face as Coca-Cola Classic after howls of
protest from Coke drinkers.
   A text panel notes that on the day Coke announced it would
bring back its original formula in 1985, ABC News interrupted
"General Hospital" with a special bulletin, and 18,000
appreciative people lit up Coke's switchboard in Atlanta.
   The display quotes Coke President Donald R. Keough: "Some
critics will say Coca-Cola made a marketing mistake. Some
cynics will say that we planned the whole thing. The truth is
we are not that dumb and we are not that smart."

   Let's see if we understand the new system. The President's
thoughts about budget cuts on domestic issues are irrelevant,
but if Congress targets strategic programs for oblivion the
Commander in Chief can do nothing about it. President Bush
plans a speech today to salvage the Pentagon budget, but it
may be too little too late.
   Chairman Les Aspin led the charge when his House Armed
Services Committee slashed $24 billion from the Bush defense
budget of $307 billion. This includes chopping nearly $2
billion from SDI's $4.7 billion proposal and the elimination
of the entire B-2 Stealth Bomber program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stealth won't be coming up on anyone's radar screen if the
House committee has its way. The committee voted to eliminate
the entire program after the 15 planes already authorized are
built. This drove Rep. Ron Dellums, the Berkeley dove, into
deep rapture. "I've been awake since about 4:30 this morning
trying to come to grips with what we've done," he said
yesterday. "I was out running at 6 this morning just because
I was exhilarated."
   The Senate may salvage some of the worst cuts, but its
price may be the death of strategic defense. Democrats
Richard Shelby and Jeff Bingaman plan to offer an amendment
on the Senate floor this week that would deny President Bush
the option of deploying SDI anytime this decade. Not
coincidentally, the amendment would steer SDI money to
projects in the senators' states, Alabama and New Mexico.
   Senator Sam Nunn once suggested he'd support this
amendment, but now is having second thoughts. Significantly,
he wants to see enough money spent to adequately test
Brilliant Pebbles, the little satellites that might one day
intercept incoming missiles. "We have to look at that
technology," Mr. Nunn told us yesterday, since it may have
other important uses such as communications. This is welcome
news, though we can't agree with him that SDI needs more
"line-item and management guidance" from Congress. When has
any weapon benefited from Congressional micromanagement?
   There is plenty for President Bush to say about American
defenses. He might note that for all the changes, there is no
evidence that the Soviet Union has slowed its military
spending by one soft ruble. SS-24 and SS-25 nuclear missiles
still roll down the assembly line, pointing at the U.S.
   Even if the Cold War eventually thaws on the Soviet side
as well, Congress has taken aim at the very defense systems
that make sense in a world where the typical threat is posed
by places such as Libya and Iraq. Stealth is designed to slip
nuclear weapons by Soviet radar, but with its 10,000-mile
range can also get conventional weapons to anywhere in the
world. SDI becomes more important as each tinpot dictator
inevitably gets his hands on ballistic missiles.
   Strategy obviously means one thing to Pentagon planners
and quite another to doves in Congress. It was a commitment
to strength that forced the Soviets to begin to change their
ways. This is no time to declare victory and announce
disarmament.

   Bush, Risking Partisan Budget Scrap,
   Threatens to Stop Being Kinder, Gentler

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush, risking a partisan firefight
that could destroy the chances for a budget compromise this
fall, is threatening to step up his attacks on the Democrats.
   Although Mr. Bush himself said nothing publicly yesterday,
he told congressional Republicans he is prepared to alter his
tactics and criticize Democrats for standing in the way of a
budget compromise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Brother, he's got fire in his belly," said House
Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois. The president is
"certainly not going to keep his trap shut all during
August."
   Although House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia
said he is advising Mr. Bush and his aides to realize "that
their opponents are not people of good will," other
Republican budget negotiators and administration officials
insist Mr. Bush hasn't given up on the bipartisan budget
summit yet.
   Instead, they say the administration has chosen to walk a
fine line: criticizing Democrats without being so harsh that
it becomes impossible to resume negotiations after the August
congressional recess. One senior GOP congressional aide
predicted Mr. Bush will temper his criticism if Democrats
agree this week to a firm timetable for reaching an agreement
in September. Negotiations for such a timetable are
continuing.
   Nevertheless, the prospect of a month of partisan attacks
and counterattacks led to more pessimism on Capitol Hill
about the chances of reaching an accord before
across-the-board spending cuts are triggered on Oct. 15.
   "It's going to make it very difficult to arrive at a
negotiated settlement if the administration deliberately
poisons the political atmosphere over the next few weeks,
which they seem intent on doing," said Sen. Jim Sasser (D.,
Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, senior Republican on that committee,
conceded: "The odds of us not being able to get it done are
increased over two weeks ago." But the New Mexico Republican
added: "I clearly believe it's doable in September."
   "I think the first half of the summit has collapsed," Rep.
Gingrich said outside the White House yesterday, adding: "I
think the president is committed to trying to resurrect it in
September."
   The only way to avoid triggering the deep spending cuts
mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will be to
alter the law, an option the administration says it will
veto, or to wrap up a compromise immediately after Labor Day
and rush it through Congress -- which remains a possibility.
   "I'm quite optimistic when we get back here (from the
August break) you'll see a serious exchange of offers," said
Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee. Despite yesterday's rhetoric, negotiators are
still contemplating several days of intense talks in the
first week of September.
   Mr. Bush and his congressional allies have been backed
into a corner by the Democrats and by their own missteps.
President Bush in June said he was willing to raise taxes,
repudiating his campaign promise without extracting any
substantial concessions from Democrats. A month later, bitter
House Republicans demanded that the summit eschew any tax
increases. And then last week, widely reported leaks of a
draft Republican proposal painted the party as favoring
higher taxes on beer, wine and liquor, along with limits on
deductions for state and local income taxes.
   Almost immediately, some Republican negotiators began
disavowing parts of the plan. Now that Mr. Bush has elected
not to demand that Congress delay or cancel its August
recess, a course that some of his advisers suggested, the
only ammunition he has left is harsh rhetoric.
   Democrats, meanwhile, have kept their own substantial
internal divisions quiet and haven't endorsed any unpopular
proposals -- either in public or, much to the frustration of
the Republicans, at the closed-door budget summit. "By our
silence, we have been successful in the summit so far," said
Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee.
   "The Republicans have just shot themselves in the foot, in
the neck, in the ear," he added. "They're masochists."
   Rep. Gingrich agrees. The summit has been like "watching
the Republicans punch themselves in the face," he said. So
far, the political costs have fallen on the Republicans. But
he added: "The political costs aren't over. It's like
measuring World War II right after Pearl Harbor."
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, spending cuts of about $85
billion -- or perhaps as much as $100 billion depending on
certain technical factors -- will be triggered on Oct. 15
unless Congress passes legislation bringing the
administration's deficit forecast below $110 billion before
then. By all accounts, the spending cuts would be so deep
that the federal government would have to lay off employees
and reduce services -- although it isn't completely clear how
quickly that would happen.
   While the budget negotiators have been bickering, Congress
has been proceeding with spending bills that would add to the
deficit rather than reduce it. Congressional Republicans said
Mr. Bush vowed to veto them yesterday. "When the spending
bills come to him which are in excess of what he has
proposed, he has made up his mind to issue the vetoes," said
Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.).

   Literary World Is Debating How Much
   Of a Huckster a Book Writer Should Be

   In between camcorders, ruby rings and facial-hair
removers, several cable television shopping channels have
started selling a novel product: books.
   Viewers can call a toll-free number to buy a copy while
the author and a host sit in a studio extolling the book's
virtues: "great photos;" "easy reading;" "get your own
autographed copy." Best-selling novelist Rosamunde Pilcher
pitched her latest book on QVC, and Arthur Hailey and Bob
Hope have appeared on J.C. Penney's Television Shopping
Channel. QVC says it sells 100 to 150 books a minute.

   Faced with the hard economics of publishing, many writers
have become more aggressive and creative about promoting
their books and themselves. Joan Didion modeled a turtleneck
in an ad for the Gap clothing stores. Leslie Walker, a
Baltimore reporter, traveled the talk show circuit with the
brother of a murderer she portrayed in her book -- until the
brother was jailed for murder. Jimmy Carter took journalists
on fishing trips to promote "An Outdoor Journal" several
years ago -- and he's a former president.
   But there's debate in the book world about how much of a
huckster a writer should be. The latest author to kindle the
controversy is Ken Follett. To increase sales of "Pillars of
the Earth," his latest novel in paperback, he agreed to be
part of the prize in a contest advertised in thousands of
bookstores. "Pillars" is about the building of a medieval
cathedral, and the winner of the contest will get a free trip
to England and a tour of Westminster Abbey guided by the
author.
   And that's not all. At his publisher's request, Mr.
Follett wrote a romantic short story, "The Abiding Heart,"
that takes place in the present but uses the same medieval
cathedral as a backdrop. Good Housekeeping magazine got the
story free for its current issue. In return, Mr. Follett's
publisher, a division of Penguin USA, received two full pages
advertising the "Pillars" contest just before the story.
   Some people in the book world are bothered by the Follett
magazine story because it was specifically written to garner
space -- and attention -- for an ad.
   "I think it's disgraceful," says James Michener, the
83-year-old author of 37 books. But Tama Janowitz, who
promoted her novel "Slaves of New York" with a video of
herself at parties with Andy Warhol, says, "You do what you
have to . . . and as long as someone is moved to read your
book, it's worthwhile."
   "I'd be crazy to turn down the chance to reach 20 million
Americans {Good Housekeeping's readership} at one sweep,"
says Mr. Follett. So zealously does the author groom his
public image that he says he once took a course to learn to
apply his own make-up for television, and went to a "color
analyst" so "I would wear colors that make me look
attractive."
   Until recently, few authors would have admitted to such
concerns. "Ten years ago it was considered a bit tacky for a
serious writer to even go on a talk show," says Roger Straus
III, managing director of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. "The late
Walker Percy refused to go on Dick Cavett no matter how much
Cavett begged, and that was considered the best show for
selling books. Percy said his job was writing books, not
selling them."
   Some writers still feel that way, including John Hersey
and Anne Tyler, but the number is dwindling. Even John Updike
will talk about his books on National Public Radio or the
network morning shows, and for his last book, "The Russia
House," John le Carre agreed to spend a week in New York
doing interviews.
   "There is no longer a stigma attached to doing this," says
Laurence Kirshbaum, head of Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Books.
"{Writers} know if they want the bucks, want the books to
sell, they better roll up their sleeves and turn off the word
processor and get out there and sell."
   Self-promotion by authors isn't entirely new. Mark Twain
was a notorious ham on the lecture circuit, and Charles
Dickens performed paid readings by the hundreds.
Book-promoting was taken to the heights of hype and crassness
in the 1970s by such legendary hustlers as Jacqueline Susann.
Ms. Susann wooed bookstore owners and wholesalers with
personal notes and visits. To get on television, she would
even do game shows. Barbara Cartland pitched not only her
romance novels but also her own line of bedsheets, greeting
cards, perfume and vitamins, and she recorded an album of
love songs.
   Until recently, it seemed that writers were divided into
roughly two camps: It was all right for writers of trashy
novels to promote aggressively, but serious authors didn't
dirty their hands. Now, the distinctions are breaking down.
   More than 50,000 books are published a year, and most
disappear fast, selling fewer than 5,000 copies. In the past
decade, many publishing houses have been bought by big
conglomerates that chase surefire best-seller writers with
huge advances. The payments may not "earn out" unless the
author's name can be burned into the public's consciousness.
   "One of the wonderful, sad and desperate things about this
business is that nobody really knows how to sell books," says
Mr. Straus of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, whose authors include
Scott Turow. "Especially as the stakes have gotten higher, we
are all thrashing around looking for some way to sell these
books."
   Advertising helps, but the usual marketing budget of
$15,000 -- or even, say, $200,000 for an expected bestseller
-- won't buy much of it. Author tours are one answer, and
more are being organized than ever. Even most literary
authors make the rounds of a dozen or so well-known
independent bookstores.
   "There are so many writers out there that if you have a
chance to flog your book, you can't say no," says Mark
Childress, who is embarking on a 22-city tour this fall for
"Tender," his new novel. "My first two books got wonderful
reviews, but hardly anybody bought them. I spent two years in
a room writing this book, and three weeks on the road isn't a
big investment of my time. I want to make this a living, not
a hobby."
   Getting exposure, even for a best-selling author like Mr.
Follett, requires a strategy. Mr. Follett's paperback
publisher, New American Library, knew that no magazine would
make a big fuss excerpting part of "Pillars" because it had
already appeared in hardcover. But once the publisher began
talking to Good Housekeeping about doing a contest, and how
to promote it, the magazine's editors agreed to run a short
story by Mr. Follett if the magazine could have it
exclusively.
   It's too early to say what effect the story and contest
will have on sales, but "Pillars" jumped onto the New York
Times paperback best-seller list at fourth place about when
it landed in bookstores.
   This wasn't the first offbeat book promotion by the
41-year-old British ex-journalist. To introduce a pen several
years ago, Bic ran ads picturing Mr. Follett's latest novel,
"Lie Down With Lions." Next to his signature, the copy read,
"The Bic Metal Point Roller is so exciting and stimulating I
couldn't put it down." In turn, his paperback publisher
shrink-wrapped thousands of free pens to copies of the book.
   Mr. Follett's special willingness to hustle may have been
one factor in the recent feverish auction for his future
books. "One of the key factors in buying Ken's books is that
he's an aggressive promoter," concurs Carole Baron, publisher
of the Dell division of Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing
Group, which has agreed to advance Mr. Follett $12.3 million
for two novels.
   As the pressure mounts, some authors are struggling to
figure out just where they should draw the line: What is
acceptable, honorable promotion, and what isn't?
   "It doesn't bother me that these young guys are getting a
flood of money," says Mr. Michener. "But I think they better
be very careful about the ethics of their profession. Society
gives writers leverage, and the ethical obligation is to use
that leverage creatively for the welfare of society and the
profession."
   Mr. Michener donates all his lecture fees to charity and
turned down "very substantial sums of money" to appear in a
wine commercial. But he recalls having to spend five years on
the lecture circuit early in his career, and he says he did
appear in a liquor ad years ago.
   "I do think there is an area of respectable promotion,"
says William Styron, but he says he wouldn't endorse a
product or appear on something like the cable shopping
channel, because "that becomes hucksterism."
   Mr. Styron says he was amazed recently at a request to use
a passage from his novel "Sophie's Choice" in a commercial
for Calvin Klein's Obsession perfume. "They were talking a
lot of money, but I very emphatically decided not to," says
Mr. Styron. "For one thing, my daughter told me she would
never speak to me again if I did it."
   "I'm sure there are things I wouldn't do, like promoting
cigarettes," says Mr. Follett. "I understand there are
writers who are deeply, deeply serious about the creative
work they do and who feel promoting themselves would sully
that. But it would be pretentious to feel that way about
entertainment fiction. The way I look at it, I'm an
entertainer."

   After a Rocky Year,
   `Prime Time Live'
   Emerges Less Live
   ---
   Once Hyped as Breakthrough,
   ABC Show Now Retreats;
   Tense Hosts and a Turkey

   NEW YORK -- "Prime Time Live" set out to change network
television. Instead, network television changed "Prime Time
Live."
   It all seemed so promising a year ago. That's when ABC
News's president and technological wizard, Roone Arledge,
formed a hot-shot team and conceived a dramatic new format to
take a stab at one of television's most elusive and coveted
products: a successful prime-time news program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The show would be anchored by ABC's biggest name
correspondent, Sam Donaldson, and the glamorous Diane Sawyer,
snatched away from rival CBS News for an annual salary of
$1.6 million.
   "Prime Time Live" would be like nothing ever seen on
television. Early ads for the program promised viewers that
their "world will never be the same." The show would air
entirely live, criss-crossing the globe from event to event,
with correspondents who would go through passports like
tissues.
   It would have a live studio audience, called upon to react
to the breaking events of the day. And it would feature
unscripted and topical repartee between Mr. Donaldson and Ms.
Sawyer. As part of the preshow hype, she described the
match-up as "a blind date between Emily Dickinson and the
Terminator."
   But the grandiose plans soon crashed head-on with a
reality of mediocre ratings, poor reviews and, ultimately,
diminished expectations. A year later, "Prime Time Live" is a
drastically altered show.
   Gone are the studio audience, the flurry of live reports
from far-flung places, the program-closing chit-chat between
"Sam &amp; Diane." They don't even sit side-by-side anymore: Mr.
Donaldson departed for Washington, D.C., in May. Also gone
are some of the most expensive technological toys in
television, including a $400,000 "vidwall," composed of 16
monitors stacked atop one another and used as a backdrop on
the show's set. Even the booming theme music, composed by
Bill Conti, who scored "Rocky," has been scrapped.
   "Prime Time Live" diverted from its grand designs because
of problems with conflicting visions, an overemphasis on
going live and poor on-air chemistry between the two stars.
   "The lesson we learned is when you're in prime time, you
can't take risks you can at other parts of the day," says
Joanna Bistany, the No. 2 executive at ABC News. "People just
have higher expectations."
   The show's executive producer, Rick Kaplan, agrees. "Some
of the live pieces were real sweet and would've looked great
on a local station's morning show," he says. "They just had
no place on prime time television."
   That is not to say that "Prime Time Live" has been a
disaster. Its ratings, while not in the blockbuster category,
have been respectable against tough competition and better
than those of the show it replaced (9.8% of the available
audience for the second quarter of this year, compared with
6.3% last year, when "Heartbeat" was carried in that slot).
For cost-conscious Capital Cities/ABC Inc., the program costs
less than an entertainment show -- an average of $400,000 per
episode, compared with $1 million for an hour-long drama --
and turns a modest profit.
   It has produced some fine segments, such as an
investigative report on the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. It
recently received six Emmy nominations. And ABC remains
exuberant about its future. "What the show is today is a
culmination of its past experience, and the show is better
off because of it," Ms. Bistany says.
   The first-anniversary show of "Prime Time Live" will be
broadcast tonight, and a revised format "will become clear in
the next few weeks," she says. The new format will probably
include two investigative stories or newsmaker interviews, a
story of an individual vs. the system and some kind of moving
feature -- much like any other network news magazine.
   That is a far cry from the hype. When Roone Arledge got
the go-ahead last year to supply a second prime-time hour to
complement "20/20," he envisioned a control room filled with
monitors, each one displaying a riveting event. The show
would jump from story to story.
   "The problem was there are few events going on Thursday
night at 10," recalls one person involved in early planning.
   Eight weeks before the show was to premiere, Mr. Arledge's
hand-picked producer, "Good Morning America" alum Phyllis
McGrady, quit suddenly because of a family illness. Mr.
Arledge hastily tapped Kaplan, the executive producer of
"Nightline," who just a few months earlier had told his staff
he wouldn't be leaving the show.
   That upset "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel -- who had
already lost several senior people to the program -- and
began a series of battles between "Prime Time Live" and
"Nightline" that ultimately led Mr. Koppel to fax a letter to
Mr. Kaplan severing their professional relationship.
   As the Aug. 3 premiere date approached, no stories were
ready to go on the air. The show wasn't even named. Among the
dozens of rejected titles were "Dateline," "Smoking Gun,"
"Prime Seat," "Scoop," "Day of Air" and, the staff's
favorite, "TV One," named after the ABC studio in Manhattan
where the show originated.
   "Nothing was in place eight weeks before we went on the
air," says Mr. Kaplan. "We didn't have one piece finished. We
didn't even have our head booker {who schedules guests}
hired. It was a prescription for failure. Absolute disaster."
   Despite a two-year commitment from the network, "Prime
Time Live" had a special problem: Key players had starkly
different visions of what the show would be. That was
aggravated by Mr. Arledge's style of not interfering with
executive producers. He let his multimillion-dollar project
drift. (Mr. Arledge would not comment for this article.)
   Mr. Donaldson, who thought the network wanted a show that
stressed live elements about breaking news, didn't prepare
any taped stories last summer. Ms. Sawyer, however, says, "We
were each doing what we dreamed the show would be. I taped
pieces last summer."
   The slow start-up hurt the show for weeks. Each week,
segments were being edited literally up until the last
minute, sometimes being broadcast from the editing room, a
highly unusual practice for a prime-time news show.
   And the emphasis on being live led to some weird TV. On
Aug. 17, the show reported on the poisoning of the
500-year-old Treaty Oak tree in Austin, Texas -- a live
segment on a dying tree in a black Texas night. It cost
thousands of dollars to light the tree for television.
   Virtually everyone agrees that the show's low live point
came on Thanksgiving, Nov. 23. "Prime Time Live" traveled to
the Truck Stop of America, a homey diner in Ontario, Calif.,
to convey a slice of Americana. But the joint was not exactly
jumping. Throughout much of the live segment, people talked
about what interesting things had happened in the diner
earlier in the day.
   Inside ABC News, that's referred to as the "Thanksgiving
turkey show."
   One quirky and expensive live segment never even made it
on the air. ABC News commissioned a piece on Colossus, a
menacing roller coaster in Valencia, Calif. Five cameras were
set up, a 12-year-old boy riding in the first car was hooked
up to a device showing his pulse and heartbeat, and another
gizmo showed the speed.
   The cost for the elaborate two-minute piece was $150,000.
It worked well in a dress rehearsal, but it was ultimately
scrapped. Some on the show say it didn't go on the air
because it kept getting bumped until it became too dark in
California to show it live. Mr. Kaplan says simply, "It
didn't work."
   Since then, "Prime Time Live's" bright spots have been
accomplished largely without the show's
trademark-turned-albatross-the concept of "live."
   Then there is that live audience. Studio audiences are
more endemic to tabloid television and the likes of
"Geraldo." But ABC News pioneered the concept for network
news with its critically acclaimed town meetings, hosted by
Mr. Koppel.
   Mr. Donaldson says, "The show came with the audience. They
were part of the given of the format. I tried to use the
audience." But Ms. Sawyer says, "I was less comfortable with
the audience. Many times it had nothing to do. It turned us
into performers."
   The two anchors' own discomfort with the live audience
added to their own lack of on-air chemistry, once described
affectionately by ABC News as "fire and ice." Often, Ms.
Sawyer's on-air body language told the story. She would sit,
arms crossed, obviously not relaxed. And she would rib her
co-anchor. On the Sept. 28 broadcast, the two engaged in an
unrehearsed discussion about controversial racial remarks by
comedian Jackie Mason. Mr. Donaldson spoke out against racial
and ethnic jokes. "Let it be said here tonight," Ms. Sawyer
said, "that Sam Donaldson worried over sensitivities. . . . I
want this declared."
   Everyone stresses that Mr. Donaldson and Ms. Sawyer admire
each other's work and like one another personally. But Mr.
Kaplan admits that "the chemistry problem perceived on the
air is an accurate one. They have two remarkable styles, two
very strong styles. It's like an orchid and a rose. They are
gorgeous flowers and they don't make a great bouquet."
   Tonight, as "Prime Time Live" embarks on its second
season, the show's makers are more certain of their
direction. "Topical, hard-hitting pieces and newsmakers,"
says Mr. Kaplan.
   "There's been no time to look at how we got into the
trouble we were in," he adds. "I've only had time to try to
get us out of it each week."

   NATIONAL HEALTH LABORATORIES Inc., a subsidiary of Revlon
Inc., said it began the public sale of 13 million shares of
its common stock at $13.25 each. The company said an
additional 1.8 million shares would be offered for sale
subject to underwriters' over-allotment options. The public
offering, which was announced last month, would boost the
percentage of stock traded publicly to 20% from 5% if all the
shares are sold. Consequently Revlon's stake in the La Jolla,
Calif., medical testing concern would shrink to 80% from 95%.
Proceeds from the sale are expected to help Revlon's owner,
Ronald Perelman, repay bank debt and help enhance the value
of Revlon's assets. In national over-the-counter trading
yesterday, National Health closed at $13.125, down 12.5
cents.

   First, the value of your house sagged. Now, the value of
your business may be tumbling, too.
   The market for selling small firms "is getting worse,"
says Jerome Siebert, a Fairfield, Conn., business broker.
"Buyers are passing up deals they would have taken a very
hard look at last year." When they do decide to buy, Mr.
Siebert says, "they're going to press even harder for a
better deal."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Buyers have been forced to become more conservative as
bank regulators and the threat of recession have pressured
U.S. commercial banks to retreat from highly leveraged
transactions. New money sources, such as foreign investors,
have taken up some of the slack. And even sellers are willing
to help finance some deals. But financing terms today require
buyers to put more of their own money into transactions. With
more equity -- and risk -- in the deal, they want higher
returns. Experts say that expectation, in addition to the
more conservative nature of the lenders, is driving down
purchase prices.
   Most business brokers, investment bankers and financiers
say prices for small companies continued to decline during
the first half of this year after falling throughout last
year. In 1989, the median price of publicly announced
business sales tracked by Mergerstat Review, a trade
publication, declined nearly 36%.
   Where small companies were selling for as much as eight to
10 times cash flow in 1988, they are unlikely to get more
than six times cash flow today, says Jon Ledecky, a partner
of the Legacy Fund, a Washington, D.C., group that buys
stakes in family-run businesses.
   "Getting deals done at the old lofty levels is no longer
achievable," he says. "That, I can say, is a national rule at
this point, no matter how hot the field."
   Mr. Ledecky and many others don't see conditions for
business sellers improving. "The environment for selling
small businesses is not going to change in the next 18
months," Mr. Ledecky says. "If anything, it's going to get
worse."
   There are dissenters to the majority view. "All deals are
down, but the market you're talking about {smaller companies}
is the most promising and most active at the moment," says
Elizabeth Squeri, editor of Buyouts, a Wellesley Hills,
Mass., newsletter. "We're cautiously saying things are
getting better."
   There's no doubt some small companies are still in strong
demand, especially in hot industries such as environmental
services and biotechnology. And the big corporations that
snap up small firms for strategic reasons are largely
unaffected by the new financial climate.
   Ted Berghorst, chairman of Vector Securities International
Inc., a Chicago-based investment bank specializing in life
sciences, says big corporations are actively seeking out
deals in biotechnology, where sales of genetically engineered
drugs are expected to rise sharply. "We have seen absolutely
no significant slowdown in terms of buyer interest," he says.
   Tokyo's Mitsubishi Kasei Corp., for instance, recently
paid about $20 million for Seradyne Inc., a small
Indianapolis firm that markets diagnostic systems. "They had
some very exciting core technologies that complemented
Mitsubishi's product line," says Mr. Berghorst.
   As Mitsubishi Kasei's purchase illustrates, foreign
investment also offers some hope for sellers of small
companies. "Our overall volume {of foreign investment} has
increased markedly in the past year, which we didn't expect,"
says Robert Machinist, president of MMG Patricof &amp; Co., a New
York investment banking firm with offices in five European
cities.
   Mr. Machinist's firm is in the process of raising about
$25 million for a U.S. video-production company to help it
make acquisitions. The money came from the sale of preferred
stock and warrants to European investors. At the Legacy Fund,
Mr. Ledecky says Girozentrale Vienna, a New York merchant
bank that represents Austrian investors, just funded the
leveraged buy-out of Snell Environmental Services Inc., a
small Astor, Penn., concern.
   For most sellers of small companies, however, the
traditional bank financing they were accustomed to has dried
up. "Two years ago, several hundred U.S. banks were willing
to do highly leveraged transactions," says James Cowart, a
principal of Capital Resource Partners, a Boston merger
maker. "Today, there's a real small number who are doing
them." To close the recent sale of a small electronics
concern, he says, "we were faced with putting up all the
capital."
   In the past 18 months, "there's been a steady shift among
lenders to a much more conservative approach, and my feeling
is it is going to continue like this for a while," says Paul
Broude, a partner at O'Connor, Broude, Snyder &amp; Aronson, a
Waltham, Mass., law firm that represents emerging businesses
with sales of $70 million or less.
   As a result, companies that used to take four to six
months to sell are staying on the block for six to nine
months. "Closing is very difficult in this market," says MMG
Patricof's Mr. Machinist. "You have to do much more work to
accomplish the same task."
   When companies finally sell, buyers are forced to come up
with more equity to satisfy their lenders. Lloyd Greif, vice
chairman and managing director of finance at Sutro &amp; Co., a
Los Angeles investment bank, says financiers typically want
twice as much equity in deals today.
   In May 1986, for example, when Sutro arranged the sale of
Krause's Sofa Factory to Equivest Partners Inc., a Newport
Beach, Calif., investment group, less than 10% of the
approximately $20 million purchase price was in the form of
Equivest equity. Nearly three years later, Equivest purchased
Insurance Auto Auctions for roughly the same price. But this
time, the same lender required it to come up with equity
equal to 20% of the purchase price.
   With more of their own money in the transaction,
increasing their risk, buyers are expecting commensurately
higher returns. One popular way to get them is to pay less.
"People are more value-oriented," says Mr. Machinist.
"There's less speculative buying."
   Richard Israel, a Los Angeles business broker, says the
buyers of the three companies that he helped sell this year
paid an average of 15% to 20% less than what the owners were
asking. "Sellers haven't recognized the changes," he says.
   Some small-business owners are finding that out the hard
way. In the past 90 days alone, says Mr. Siebert, the
Connecticut business broker, three deals he tried to arrange
with Mr. Ledecky's Legacy Fund "fell on their face." Mr.
Siebert says the buyers could not arrange financing, even
though the companies -- an apparel-accessories firm, a
computer outfit and a publishing concern -- are all
profitable, with combined pretax earnings of $6.2 million.
"The banks six months ago would take those deals," he says.
   Counters Mr. Ledecky: "Jerry and I differ very much on why
those deals fell through. The sellers had very unrealistic
expectations about what their companies are worth. Money is
there for prudently priced transactions. But the days of
eight to 10 times cash flow are over."

   WASHINGTON -- Three new economic reports suggest the U.S.
economy remains stagnant.
   The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic
indicators was unchanged in June, following a roller-coaster
0.7% rise in May and a 0.2% drop in April. The department
also reported that spending on construction was virtually
unchanged during June. And the National Association of
Purchasing Management reported a sharp drop in its index of
manufacturing health for July.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest figures, which follow a string of anemic
economic indicators, fueled speculation among some economists
that the economy is headed for a downturn. "I expect a mild
recession to begin in the fourth quarter," said Chris
Varvares of Laurence H. Myer &amp; Associates, an economic
research and consulting firm in St. Louis. Other analysts
predict the economy will escape recession, but remain very
sluggish.
   Six of the 11 indicators in the Commerce Department's
forecasting index turned down in June. A drop in unfilled
manufacturers' orders contributed the biggest decline,
followed by a drop in the money supply.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said he was disturbed particularly by the decline in
new and unfilled orders for manufacturers goods. "This is
where we were hoping to have strength," he said.
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported that new
construction reached an annual rate of $447.5 billion in May,
barely changed from $447.6 billion in June. An increase in
spending on office buildings during the month was offset by a
decline in spending on housing.
   And in the first hint of the economy's health in July, the
National Association of Purchasing Management said its index
of factory health plunged to 47.4% in the month, from 51.1%
in June and 50.7% in May. The index largely reflected a
decline in orders for factory goods, which fell in July after
five straight monthly increases. According to the purchasing
managers, a reading below 50% indicates the manufacturing
economy is shrinking.
   "The manufacturing economy started the third quarter
poorly, abruptly ending a three-month moderate, but solid,
increase in growth," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the
group's survey committee and director of materials management
at Pitney Bowes Inc. "The weakness of new orders in July now
casts a shadow over the previous expectations for continued
growth in the economy."
   The purchasing managers report showed that exports
continue to be the one bright sport in the economy. The new
export orders index rose to 57% in July from 56.5% in June.
   The export figure isn't seasonally adjusted, but other
figures in the three reports are.
                                                                                                       

                                                                                                       

   Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments, the index was unchanged for June.

   Spain's Rediscovery of Latin America
   Spurs Hopes of Cooperation, Partnership

   MADRID -- With his back to a portrait of Simon Bolivar,
the man who led Latin America's struggle for independence in
the early 1800s, Fernando Valenzuela reviews relations with
Spain's former New World colonies.
   "For the first time in its history," affirms Mr.
Valenzuela, the head of Spain's overseas-development agency,
"Spain can be of use to Latin America."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And, he might well add, Latin America can be of use to
Spain.
   Nearly five centuries after Christopher Columbus, Spain is
rediscovering Latin America. But this time, it is seeking
partnership and cooperation rather than empire.
   In part, its aim is assisting Latin American development.
But there is a measure of self-interest as well. Spanish
firms are looking to the region for expansion. And Spanish
diplomats and officials are dreaming of an Ibero-American
community of nations.
   "If Spain has any area of influence and contacts, it's in
Latin America," says Pina Lopez Gay, the executive vice
chairman of Spain's commission for commemorating the 500th
anniversary of Columbus's arrival in America in 1492.
   "For any Spaniard," says Candido Velazquez-Gaztelu,
chairman of Telefonica de Espana S.A., "Latin America is the
prolongation of our own land. Our peoples have the same
language, the same culture. There are great opportunities for
us to do business together."
   However, despite such ties and the family links forged by
cross-migration, "there are a lot of misunderstandings on
both sides," says Pedro Shimose, a Bolivian writer who lives
in Madrid.
   Spain, though still "la madre patria", or mother country,
for many Latin Americans, is viewed by large numbers in the
region with mixed affection and contempt. Tales of the
cruelty of the Spanish conquistadors and of the Latin
American fight for independence still foster resentment. On
the Spanish side, years of post-colonial prejudice are summed
up in the word "sudaca", used dismissively by Spaniards to
refer to their South American cousins.
   "We have had a strange love-hate relationship," says
Emilio Cassinello, a former Spanish ambassador to Mexico.
"Perhaps it's because we haven't been able to digest past
history."
   As part of its drive for closer ties, Spain is offering
aid, trade and political cooperation to its former colonies.
And it has taken on a role as their advocate and protector in
relations with Western Europe. The bottom line, in both
cases, is Spain's search for a greater world role.
   There are signs that Spain is winning increased
international credibility because of its links with Latin
America. Though Spain was sharply critical of the U.S.
military intervention in Panama, U.S. officials say
Washington pays heed to Madrid's views on the region.
   In October and February, Spain was host for two rounds of
talks between Britain and Argentina that led them to mend
diplomatic relations torn by the 1982 war over the Falkland
Islands. Spain also provided facilities for talks -- albeit
inconclusive ones -- between warring factions in Guatemala.
   Spain's 1992 Columbus celebration is providing a major
impulse for its Ibero-American community plans. As part of
the buildup, Spain has launched a series of projects with
Latin America, including a multivolume history of
Ibero-America, the repair of historic monuments in Latin
America and a Spanish-language patent registry.
   Loosely modeled on Britain's Commonwealth and France's
ties with Francophone Africa, Spain's vision of an
Ibero-American community still lacks any institutional
framework.
   From his office on the outskirts of Madrid, Mr. Valenzuela
manages an aid budget of less than $100 million a year, more
than half of which goes to the poorest of Latin American
countries. Until the early 1980s, Spain was an aid recipient
itself. Now, its economy is booming and it can afford to
share its wealth.
   On the commercial front, while Spanish firms start with a
linguistic advantage, they face tough competition from other
countries. The U.S., West Germany, Italy and France all have
stronger commercial ties with the region.
   But many companies are hoping to change the situation.
"Until now, we haven't taken as much commercial advantage of
our links with Latin America as we should have," says
Telefonica's Mr. Velazquez-Gaztelu. In addition to buying
into the telephone systems of Chile and Argentina this year,
Telefonica is interested in Mexico, Venezuela and Puerto
Rico.
   Last month, the Spanish airline Iberia led a consortium
that was the sole bidder for a stake in Aerolineas
Argentinas, and Repsol, the Spanish state oil company, has
linked up with Petroleos Mexicanos.

   A LOAN FOR BANGLADESH

   Bangladesh has secured its first major commercial loan and
thus may have improved the chances for attracting additional
foreign investment.
   The $100 million loan is part of a $435 million financing
package for a fertilizer plant that is expected to increase
substantially the country's exports when it is completed in
three years. The package also includes a complex mix of
foreign-export credits, government concessions, investments
by equity partners and political-risk insurance.
   Citicorp International Ltd., the Hong Kong arm of the U.S.
bank, coordinated the loan, which involves the participation
of 10 banks. Bankers say it was the project's merits rather
than new-found confidence in Bangladesh's economy that
persuaded them to make the loan.
   The Bangladesh Parliament passed a bill granting
citizenship to foreign nationals who deposit $1 million or
more in a Bangladeshi financial institution.
                                                                                                       

   HELPING SOUTH KOREA'S FARMERS
                                                                                                       

   The South Korean government strongly opposes the opening
of its agricultural markets to foreign exporters, a top Seoul
official said. Lee Kie Choo, assistant foreign minister for
economic affairs, said the country has a fragile and
vulnerable farming sector requiring protection for some time
to come. He said he doubted the government would open the
rice market to imports within 10 years.
                                                                                                       

   PARIS METRO CRACKDOWN

   The operators of the Paris Metro said they would clear the
subway system's corridors of the 2,000 vendors who illegally
sell wares to commuters from makeshift stands. A Metro
spokeswoman said transit-authority police would seize the
fruit, sunglasses and plastic toys offered for sale by the
vendors, who are mainly Third World immigrants. Prior
attempts had failed because the sellers had only been served
with summonses that they often failed to pay, she said.
                                                                                                       

   INDIAN CRASH REPORT
                                                                                                       

   Pilot error and lack of guidance from air-traffic
controllers led to the 1988 crash of an Indian Airlines plane
that killed all but two of the 135 people on board, a report
said. An Indian news agency quoted the report from a
government-appointed inquiry as saying there was no
structural or mechanical failure involved in the crash of the
17-year-old jet. The Boeing 737, on a flight from Bombay to
the western state of Gujarat, crashed in fog while
approaching the airport.
                                                                                                       

   A SUMMIT IN VENICE
                                                                                                       

   Meeting in Venice, the leaders of Italy, Czechoslovakia,
Austria, Hungary and Yugoslavia reached a wide range of
accords, most of which involved improving transportation
links among the countries. The five nations are members of
the Pentagonal Initiative, a regional alliance founded in
Budapest last November. Officials said the alliance could
bring East European countries closer to the European
Community and act as a counterweight to a unified Germany.
                                                                                                       

   HONDA'S CHINA PLANS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Honda Motor Co. is expanding its
motorcycle-service network in China and establishing
technical schools there for mechanics. Honda, which ranks
first in the world in motorcycle sales, now has service
centers in four Chinese cities. It plans to join three
Chinese motorcycle companies in setting up an extensive
service network throughout the country. Over the past three
years, the number of motorcycles in China doubled to about
five million units, Honda said.
                                                                                                       

   DEFENDING AUSTRALIA
                                                                                                       

   Australians have an underlying fear of foreign invasion,
and partly privatizing the nation's defense force could help
allay concern, according to a report by the Australian
Defense Department.
   The report, part of a drive to involve the public in
defense matters, seeks formation of a new militia and the
transfer to civilians of jobs now held by the military.
   "If our strategic outlook were to deteriorate, the
underlying paranoia Australians still harbor about foreign
attack could reappear," the report said. It said further that
actively involving Australia's civilians should end "the
malaise which causes many in the community to feel their
country cannot be defended."
   The report recommended cutting regular army, navy and
air-force strength to 47,000 from nearly 70,000, supplemented
by a 52,000-member militia conscripted for short-term
military roles. The number of civilians doing work for the
defense force on contract, such as warehousing and food
supply, would be raised to 38,000 from 15,000.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A survey of 500 Japanese business people visiting the
information museum of IBM Japan in Tokyo showed that Japanese
workers generally feel uneasy about taking long summer
vacations. Four out of five said they worried that a lot of
work would be piled up when they returned to their office
after a vacation and one in four said they phoned their
office to ask how work was going during their holidays. . . .
Italy's Undersecretary of Finance Stefano De Luca, responding
to a query in Parliament as to why the government was
ignoring prostitutes' earnings, explained that prostitution
isn't a recognized profession on tax forms and thus isn't
subject to income or sale taxes.

   WASHINGTON -- The government savings-and-loan liquidator
announced an ambitious plan to accelerate its sale of seized
S&amp;L assets, with a target of $50 billion of sales by the end
of the year.
   If successful, the Resolution Trust Corp.'s "fall
inventory reduction sale," which includes land, homes,
apartments, securities and loans, would double the pace of
sales, moving as much property in the next five months as the
agency did its entire first year of operation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The asset-disposal plan represents the government's second
major effort to reduce the debris from the S&amp;L bailout this
year. In the April-June quarter, the agency, under increasing
political pressure to show results, sold 155 failed thrifts.
But in order to attract buyers to those deals, the RTC was
only able to sell the thrifts' deposits. Those deals left the
RTC's current asset stockpile swollen to $165.3 billion.
   The fall sales plan also includes the RTC's
much-anticipated, televised auction of 71 big-ticket
properties, which has been postponed from September until
November in order to give potential buyers more time to
examine the properties.
   The $50 billion runs the gamut from hard-to-sell tracts of
land, which one official said are "best described as simply
holding the Earth together," to readily marketable packages
of on-time mortgages.
   "If they can't sell this kind of stuff, then Lord help us
all," said John Aldridge, an Atlanta thrift attorney. "These
are the more easily understood and marketable types of
assets."
   The plan, however, includes sales of $13.7 billion of its
hard-to-sell assets in receivership. These are investments
S&amp;Ls made, which have been down a long road through
government foreclosure, but which have been passed over by
potential buyers every step of the way. "It's the bad stuff,"
said William Roelle, in charge of S&amp;L sales at the RTC. "It's
the leftovers."
   Some of the assets are unusual, but saleable. Of the $6.7
billion in performing mortgages that the RTC hopes to sell
this year, 80% don't meet standards to be sold into the
secondary market. The RTC hopes to sell many of these in bulk
to big buyers. Just yesterday, it announced the sale of $225
million of second mortgages to Maryland National Bank.
   Sales plans also include two packages for "bulk" real
estate sales, each valued at approximately $40 million. One
package contains 11 hotels in the eastern U.S., the other
several Florida apartment buildings.
   Among the RTC's $3.3 billion of securities in receivership
are "several hundred million" in high-risk, high-yield "junk"
bonds that will be sold by year's end, according to Elisabeth
Spector, who oversees the RTC's securities sales.
   Most observers were optimistic that the goals were
reachable, especially as markets are growing more familiar
with the RTC and its plans. The sales include, for example,
nearly $3 billion in mortgage-backed securities from
receivership assets alone. That's a large amount, but Lyle
Gramley, chief economist with Mortgage Bankers Association,
was sanguine. "A year ago we worried about possible large RTC
sales, but they didn't materialize," he said. "I don't think
yields will be affected."
   There is so little activity in private issuing of
mortgage-backed securities that "under current conditions the
RTC probably has some room to do some liquidating," said Paul
DeRosa, a managing director at Eastbridge Capital Inc.
   The sales will still represent just the beginning for the
RTC, which, as more S&amp;Ls fail, may eventually seize and
resell a total of $500 billion in assets. While its
investment-grade securities are expected to be sold within
one year of being taken over from a seized institutions, it
says it plans to hold some raw land for as long as seven
years.
   The RTC's real-estate auction will offer only a slice of
its properties, but the agency hopes the high profile of the
affair, with closed satellite linkups to nine U.S. cities,
plus London and Tokyo, will draw hundreds of bidders and spur
interest in other properties.
   Jon Karlson, an RTC official overseeing the auction,
pointed to three properties as being particularly attractive:
the 300-room Radisson Hotel at the San Antonio, Texas,
airport; the Western Savings Corporate Center in Phoenix,
Ariz., seized from the failed Western Federal Savings & Loan;
and the 18-hole Kings Crossing Golf Course &amp; Club in San
Antonio. The pool of real estate may change, however, because
the properties are still for sale before the auction. If the
RTC gets an offer of appraised value or higher it may choose
to sell prior to the auction, Mr. Karlson said.
   Mr. Karlson wouldn't specify the prices the RTC expects on
those properties or any others. Other officials said the RTC
is debating whether to make its appraisals public, but
indicated that in order to encourage higher bidding, the
appraisals probably wouldn't be disclosed. Detailed
information on each property will be available within two
weeks, the RTC said.
   The auction will be open to the public, but serious money
will be required to bid. Bidders will have to show a
cashier's check for $75,000 to $500,000, depending on the
price of the property they're seeking, said Jim Gall,
chairman of Miami-based Auction Company of America, which
will conduct the auction from Dallas.

   WASHINGTON -- The federal government's borrowing needs
continue to explode as a result of sluggish economic growth
and the cash demands of the savings-and-loan bailout.
   The Treasury Department reported that the government will
need to borrow a record $63.5 billion in the third quarter to
finance the general needs of the government as well as the
S&amp;L bailout.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government also said it will need to borrow $65
billion to $70 billion in the fourth quarter, excluding the
money needed to provide working capital for the thrift
bailout. The amount of working capital that will be needed in
the fourth quarter for the S&amp;L bailout isn't yet known, but
it could push total government borrowing over the $100
billion mark.
   To help fill this massive financing gap in the current
quarter, the Treasury said it plans to sell $32.5 billion of
notes and bonds this month to refund $20 billion of notes
maturing on Aug. 15 and to raise $12.25 billion in cash.
   The new securities will consist of:
   -- $11.5 billion of three-year notes, to be auctioned next
Tuesday;
   -- $10.5 billion of 10-year notes, to be auctioned next
Wednesday;
   -- $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds, to be auctioned next
Thursday.
   The three-year notes will mature on Aug. 15, 1993, the
10-year notes will mature Aug. 15, 2000, and the 30-year
bonds will mature Aug. 15, 2020.
   The Treasury noted that it may have to change its auction
schedule if Congress has not raised the limit on federal debt
by Aug. 6.
   The Treasury said it also will sell $10 billion of 36-day
cash management bills next Thursday.
   Including next week's refunding, the Treasury will have
raised $40.1 billion of its $63.5 billion borrowing needs.
The remaining $23.4 billion will be raised through the sale
of regular 13-week, 26-week, and 52-week bills, as well as a
two-year note in August and a five-year note in early
September. The department said it may be necessary to sell
additional cash management bills in September.
   The Treasury said the next auction of Refcorp bonds to
finance the S&amp;L bailout will be auctioned Oct. 9 and settled
Oct. 16.

   Boutique Firm, in Bidding for IBM Line,
   Bets on New Sales Strategy, Leaner Force

   NEW YORK -- Clayton &amp; Dubilier, in negotiating to buy
nearly $2.3 billion of low-end businesses from International
Business Machines Corp., is counting on bolder sales
strategies and a smaller work force to produce payoffs that
IBM couldn't achieve.
   The proposed transaction would be the biggest so far for
Clayton &amp; Dubilier, a 22-person financial boutique
specializing in leveraged buy-outs. The transaction involves
IBM's printer, typewriter, keyboard and office-supply
operations, both in the U.S. and Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We want to grow the business," said Martin Dubilier,
chairman of Clayton &amp; Dubilier. One likely expansion area, he
said, will be in selling printers to other computer
companies, which can then market them under their own names.
Currently, IBM sells its increasingly popular $1,500 Laser
Printer only under its own name.
   "I've had calls from two major computer companies already,
wanting to know if we would consider supplying them," Mr.
Dubilier said yesterday. He declined to identify the
companies, but analysts said Digital Equipment Corp. and
Xerox Corp. are likely buyers of IBM printers and keyboards.
DEC officials declined comment; Xerox officials couldn't be
reached.
   Although IBM said it will shrink the work force of its
Information Products unit by 1,200 from its current 6,000,
Mr. Dubilier said the next move would be to hire salesmen. He
predicted that, concurrent with a buy-out, the low-end IBM
unit would hire a U.S. sales force of 200 to 250 people, and
a European sales force of another 200 people. These marketers
would sell products directly to independent computer
retailers -- a market segment in which IBM hasn't always
excelled. The low-end IBM operations don't currently have
their own specialized sales force; their products are
marketed by IBM's general sales force, which focuses on
selling more profitable large computer systems.
   Wall Street estimates are that Clayton &amp; Dubilier would
finance its buy-out with $500 million of equity, chiefly from
an institutional buy-out fund that Clayton &amp; Dubilier
controls. IBM would keep a 15% to 20% position in the
operation, while local management would get 15% ownership.
   The rest of the purchase price would be raised almost
entirely by bank debt. Units of Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. are
expected to be the lead lending banks.
   The transaction would leave the Information Products
business with about a 3.5-to-1 debt-equity ratio. That's far
more conservative than the heavily leveraged buy-outs of the
late 1980s, though still much more debt than would usually be
associated with an IBM venture.
   Several of Clayton &amp; Dubilier's longtime backers said they
were upbeat about the proposed IBM deal. "This is what
buy-out firms ought to be doing," said Scott Sperling, an
executive at Harvard University's endowment, which invests
with Clayton &amp; Dubilier. "They're taking a business that
isn't central to a big company but has good cash flow. Often
there are good opportunities for improved profits."
   Wall Street executives observed that IBM hadn't put its
low-end operations up for auction, seeking top dollar.
Instead, IBM appeared to have decided during private
negotiations last spring that it was most comfortable with
Clayton &amp; Dubilier as a buyer, even if it might mean passing
up a higher sales price.
   In its announcement yesterday, IBM reinforced the view
that non-money considerations had helped shape the deal. IBM
repeatedly talked about forming an "alliance" with Clayton &amp;
Dubilier, in which the new company would have "a set of
values very similar to those of IBM."
   One previous Clayton &amp; Dubilier buy-out -- the 1987
acquisition of the Nu-Kote office-forms division of
computer-maker Unisys Corp. -- may shed light on how the New
York firm would handle a low-end IBM acquisition. Nu-Kote's
sales have climbed about 10% a year since the buy-out.
   "I'm not hassled or overmanaged," Nu-Kote's president,
Hubbard Howe, said yesterday. "Clayton &amp; Dubilier's emphasis
is on building value, not wringing cash out of the business.
We have paid down bank loans, but that isn't the prime
objective."
   In fact, IBM lately has made rapid gains in selling
low-speed laser printers, one business it is spinning off.
IBM announced an impressive line of 10-page-per-minute
printers last year and some cheaper, five-page-per-minute
printers earlier this year. Infocorp, a market research firm
in Santa Clara, Calif., said IBM's share of that part of the
U.S. market has risen steadily through the year and surpassed
10% in June. That leaves IBM way behind Hewlett-Packard Co.,
which had a 77% market share in the first half. But analysts
expect IBM to keep boosting its share.
   Eventually, Mr. Dubilier said, "It's my dream to take this
company public." He wouldn't be pinned down on a timetable,
but typically leveraged buy-out companies have been sold in
some form after three to seven years.

   U.S. Is Seeking Help
   From U.N. to Stop
   Liberia's Civil War

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is trying to get the United Nations
to help resolve the crisis in Liberia, where two rebel
factions are battling government forces in Monrovia, the
country's capital.
   "We are extremely concerned about the fighting and the
bloodshed," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher,
explaining that the U.S. effort is still exploratory, trying
to find a way the U.N. might exert its influence to stop the
civil war.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, he said, the U.S. is helping private relief
organizations distribute 30,000 bags of rice to prevent
famine in the war-ravaged country. Other U.S. officials said
tens of thousands of Liberians have sought sanctuary in
churches and near U.S. installations in the capital, as
patrols from government troops and two rebel factions stage
sporadic fighting in downtown Monrovia.
   As many as 600 Liberians were slaughtered in a Monrovia
church on Sunday. Most of the victims are believed to have
been members of the Gio and Mano tribes, which are involved
in the rebel forces. According to Mr. Boucher, the U.S. has
eyewitness accounts that they were shot by soldiers of
President Samuel Doe, who is holed up in his fortified
headquarters in Monrovia, protected by an elite cadre of
troops. Mr. Doe and most of his troops are members of the
Krahn tribe.
   The fighting began in December, when rebel troops entered
Liberia from the north. Since then they have split into two
rival factions, the largest of which is led by Charles
Taylor, formerly the head of the government's purchasing
agency. Mr. Taylor's forces, according to one U.S. official,
are believed to include troops who have received training and
weapons from Libya.
   As the two rebel factions converged on Monrovia, the U.S.
evacuated hundreds of Americans from the country, which has a
population of 1.5 million. About 400 Americans remain,
according to the State Department, and a Marine Corps task
force has been positioned offshore in case a further
evacuation is needed. So far, according to the State
Department, there have been no attacks on embassies in
Monrovia, although some of the firefights have occurred in
the embassy district.

   Market Continues Slide as Traders Fear
   Possible Recession; Technologies Dive

   Financial and technology shares led the over-the-counter
market lower as fears of weakness among the nation's major
banks and continuing anticipation of a recession spread into
smaller stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2.33 to 435.91, a 0.5%
drop, as volume fell to nearly 129 million shares from 135.2
million Tuesday. Declining issues outpaced advancers 1,204 to
793.
</LP>

   Traders again dominated activity in the OTC market as
institutions and smaller investors stayed on the sidelines
amid pessimistic news about the economy, said Len Hefter,
director of OTC trading at Jefferies &amp; Co., Dallas.
   "To a great degree it's a market controlled by traders,"
he said, adding that dealers continue to sell quickly on any
signs of disappointment. Mr. Hefter predicted that pattern
will continue until more encouraging news spurs investors
back to the market.
   Professional traders were particularly wary of financial
stocks, according to Eric Siefert, who trades OTC financial
shares for Shearson Lehman Brothers. "There's more or less a
general feeling that things will still get worse," Mr.
Siefert said, pointing to reports of weakness in some of the
nation's largest banks. Traders are "afraid {financial
stocks} haven't hit bottom," he explained.
   Among Nasdaq's four financial indexes, the Nasdaq
Financial Index of larger institutions fell 5.80 to 363.75;
the Nasdaq Bank Index tumbled 5.19 to 315.82; the Nasdaq
Financial Index of smaller institutions slid 4.82 to 417.59,
and the Nasdaq Insurance Index plunged 6.65 to 490.91.
   Yesterday's wave of selling among smaller financial issues
was sparked by two media stories, according to James K.
Schmidt, portfolio manager of the $60 million Freedom
Regional Bank Fund, a Boston mutual fund. One was an article
yesterday in this newspaper about profit problems at some
larger banks. The other was a discussion Tuesday night on
ABC's "Nightline" television news program in which a Stanford
University economist predicted several major banks will
become insolvent.
   Although some regional banks in areas without severe real
estate problems are doing well, Mr. Schmidt said the shares
of the entire sector are being punished by fears about the
larger banks. He added that he finds the total lack of
interest in financial issues a bullish sign.
   After falling early in the day, technology issues ended
mixed amid continuing fears of a recession, traders said.
Among the OTC market's leaders, Microsoft added 1/4 to 66 3/4
after trading as low as 63 3/4; Intel fell 2 to 42 1/2; Apple
Computer gained 3/8 to 42 3/8, and Sun Microsystems was
unchanged at 31 1/2.
   Among the day's stronger technology issues, Teradata
jumped 2 to 25 3/4 after the Los Angeles maker of computer
systems reported late Tuesday that operating income for the
fourth quarter ended June 30 rose slightly to 44 cents a
share from 43 cents a year earlier. Teradata's per-share
profit was three cents above a consensus of analysts'
estimates reported by First Call, a subsidiary of Thomson
Financial Networks.
   National Health Laboratories was the day's most active
stock after 14.8 million shares of its common stock were
offered at $13.25 apiece. Nearly all of the shares are being
offered by Revlon Health Care Group Inc., which owns about
95% of the New York provider of clinical laboratory services'
common shares. National Health eased 1/8 to 13 1/8 on nearly
four million shares.
   Biotechnology shares remained active. Immunex slid 1/2 to
26 1/2, although it rebounded as high as 28 in intraday
trading after plunging four Tuesday. The drop followed a Food
and Drug Administration advisory panel's decision to delay
approval of the Seattle company's GM-CSF white blood cell
stimulant for use in bone marrow transplants. An Immunex
official told analysts late Tuesday the company hopes that it
will have additional data available "sometime this fall" for
the panel's further review, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Amgen and Genetics Institute benefited from Immunex's
delay, analysts said. Both Amgen, which jumped 2 1/2 to 88
3/4, and Genetics Institute, which rose 1 to 35 1/4, are
developing similar agents, although for broader applications
than the product Immunex is developing for use in bone marrow
transplants. Their products haven't been reviewed yet by an
FDA advisory panel.
   Vector Securities analyst Peter Drake said in an interview
he expects Immunex could win full approval for its agent by
year end. But he believes Amgen will ultimately gain about
60% of the broader market for use in treating chemotherapy
patients, with Immunex getting about 40% of that market. He
said he's advising clients that now is an opportune time to
buy both stocks.
   Summagraphics added 1/4 to 11 1/4, although the Seymour,
Conn., maker of computer graphic input devices reported that
net income for the fourth quarter ended May 31 fell to 21
cents a share from 46 cents a year earlier. Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman William J. Lifka attributed the
performance to an acquisition and a slowdown in some of its
markets, but said the company expects sales growth to return
to earlier levels.
   Novell added 1 1/2 to 49. Smith Barney, Harris Upham
analyst Therese M. Murphy raised her investment opinion on
the Provo, Utah, maker of connectivity software to
"aggressive buy" from "hold," based on recent weakness in the
stock, DJPIR said.
   FHP International dropped 7/8 to 16 1/8. The Fountain
Valley, Calif., health maintenance organization said its
fourth quarter pretax income will be affected to some degree
by a boost in reserves to cover medical malpractice claims
involving an earlier period when the company was self
insured. The reserves increase resulted from a recent, $10
million jury award arising from an incident in 1983.
   Great Country Bank fell 1/2 to 4 1/2 after the Ansonia,
Conn., bank reported a loss for the fourth quarter ended May
31 of $1.03 a share, including a $3.3 million provision for
loan losses, compared with net income of 31 cents a share a
year earlier. The bank attributed its losses to increased
provisions for loan losses related to the weak Connecticut
real estate market.
   Shorewood Packaging, extending its slide, fell 1 1/2 to 19
after Merrill Lynch analyst Arthur Rade lowered his estimates
for the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended Tuesday,
to 31 cents a share from 36 cents a share. DJPIR reported
that Mr. Rade, who retained his "buy" opinion on the
Farmingdale, N.Y., maker of paperboard packaging for the
music industry, cited a flat music industry business, among
other factors.

   AT&amp;T, Two Bell Firms Plan Technology
   To Boost Capacity of Cellular Systems

   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and two
regional Bell companies plan to develop a radio technology
that could significantly boost the capacity of cellular radio
systems, the companies said.
   AT&amp;T has signed an agreement with Qualcomm Inc., a San
Diego company that pioneered the Code Division Multiple
Access, or CDMA, technology for use in cellular radio
systems. Nynex Corp. and Chicago-based Ameritech plan to
install the systems in their networks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plan by three of the industry's biggest players to
develop and use the technology is significant because their
approval could help make it a standard for the cellular
industry and so-called personal communications services of
the future.
   Personal communications service networks, as envisioned by
the telecommunications industry, will allow millions of
customers to carry lightweight, pocket-sized phones by the
end of this century. But the networks will require enormous
transmission capacity -- many times greater than conventional
cellular telephone networks. In several major cities,
including New York and Los Angeles, these cellular networks
are suffering increasingly from capacity shortages.
   CDMA systems are said to offer up to 20 times more
call-handling capacity than the conventional cellular
systems. The CDMA systems assign a special electronic code to
each call signal, allowing more calls to occupy the same
space and be spread over an entire frequency band. By
contrast, the current standard for future digital systems,
time-division multiple access, or TDMA, offers three-to-seven
times the capacity of existing systems and works by placing
each call signal into a time slot and transmitting it within
a single frequency.
   "We are launching the next-generation digital cellular
technology," said Allen Salmasi, vice president of planning
and development at Qualcomm. "Basically these agreements will
put us on the map as a major supplier of CDMA equipment for
the cellular industry." AT&amp;T declined to comment on the
agreement.
   Nynex Mobile Communications Co., which has the more
ambitious plan of the two regional phone companies, said that
late next year in New York City it will roll out the nation's
first wireless personal telephone service. The company plans
to start out small with one new switch in Manhattan.
Yesterday, it announced a multimillion-dollar agreement to
buy the cellular switching gear from AT&amp;T for an undisclosed
amount.
   Nynex also said it agreed to buy $3 million of digital
telephone handsets from Qualcomm to sell to its customers.
The phones are expected to be smaller, lighter and cheaper
than most existing cellular phones.
   Nynex Mobile, which will use frequencies already assigned
to it for cellular telephone transmissions, conducted a trial
of the new technology from February to June, and was
enthusiastic.
   "For densely populated areas like New York, personal
telephone service will offer consumers the most flexible,
portable and practical personal communications system
available," said Robert Keller, Nynex Mobile's chief
operating officer. "When PTS is introduced next year, a
telephone number will no longer represent a place, but
rather, a person."
   Like conventional cellular service, personal telephone
service will connect with the phone system through radio
antennae. However, the antennae will be smaller. Dubbed
microcells, the antennae will be connected to a digital
network that uses the CDMA technology, which assigns to each
call a distinct code that the network can sort. That allows
many calls to be transmitted on the same frequency, with each
call remaining discrete.
   Ameritech Mobile Communications said it will be studying
the benefits of CDMA technology but during the evaluation
period still supports the current TDMA standard.
   "It is critical that we select the appropriate technology
to meet customer needs while optimizing that very valuable
resource called radio spectrum," said Roger Pachuta,
Ameritech Mobile's vice president of network and customer
services.

   Jordan, Mont. -- It was 7:20 when we drove into this
sultry plains town on a silent Sunday night. Storm clouds
gathered across the immensity of sky. The thermometer on the
bank registered 100 degrees.
   Jordan is the last town between Bozeman and the site, 55
miles away, where a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the large carnivorous
dinosaur, recently was found. Paleontologists from Bozeman's
Museum of the Rockies had been out there digging for a month.
Between Jordan and the site there is nothing but sagebrush,
badlands and a phone booth, just standing alone in the
biggest land I ever saw.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The site lies within the Charles M. Russell National
Wildlife Refuge, where more than a million acres of badlands,
prairie, juniper stands, ponderosa pine forests and rich
river bottomlands provide habitat for a variety of wildlife.
The refuge extends along the Missouri River and the reservoir
formed by the Fort Peck Dam, the world's largest
hydraulically earth-filled dam. There are elk and badger,
deer, bobcat and 236 species of birds. Camped along the river
one night, we watched half a dozen beaver nibble grass, lie
around on the beach and go for an occasional swim.
   T. Rex rested in the badlands, a country of dry, high,
rounded hills built of sandstone, mudstone, layers of coal,
clay, shale and other variations of earth. Tamarisk and
rabbit brush grow here, and foxtail barley rippling in wind
like a sand-colored sea. The soil -- bearpaw shale -- is a
hard gray mud that turns oil slick after a rain. Vehicles
just slide down it. If it rains, you stay put until the sun
has dried the earth.
   Minutes after we arrived at camp a storm hit. Wind blew
sand into our eyes, flattened tents and brought a squalling
rain. We (museum photographer Bruce Selyem and I) and five of
the six bone-diggers still in camp huddled under the tarp
roofing the kitchen. The tarp leaked, but the company was
comforting. "This is a hard place," one of the crew said. "A
hundred and four degrees during the day and every night a
storm." Two toads hopped through a puddle just beyond us,
apparently rising spontaneously out of the desert, now that
there was rain.
   They were tired, these six who were left. Chief Preparator
Pat Leiggi, Bob Harmon and Allison Gentry had been there all
month, the others long enough to have had enough. Under a hot
sun in a country with no trees, it is tedious, painstaking
work, this business of freeing bones from an earth that has
held them millions of years. Even views of an arm of the
reservoir don't help. Surrounded by mud, it flows muddy and
slow, 30 feet below normal level, the result of a drought
that has lasted too long, and the politics of water released
for navigation far downstream.
   But they were excited too. They had uncovered the most
complete T. Rex ever found. Eighty-five to 90% of it is
present. (Other T. Rexes are 50% complete at the most.) This
dinosaur, found curled up on its left side, probably was
buried quickly so that its bones were not taken by animals,
washed away by rivers or eroded by time. It also is the first
Montana T. Rex to stay in the state. T. Rex was going on a
trip, but he wasn't leaving home.
   On Labor Day 1988, area ranchers Kathy and Tom Wankel were
out prospecting when Kathy noticed some slim bones jutting
from a hillside. "I knew there were a lot here," she told me.
"And I thought, why can't I find one? I never dreamed I'd
find a whole dinosaur]" At Thanksgiving they took the bones
to the Museum of the Rockies, home base for Jack Horner, one
of the world's foremost dinosaur authorities. In May 1989,
Kathy and Tom brought the museum paleontologists to the site.
   The Wankels arrived in camp Monday morning to take leave
of their dinosaur. So did the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and Bill McKamey of Willimac Trucking in Great Falls. Mr.
McKamey had volunteered his flat-bed semi to carry T. Rex the
370 miles to Bozeman. "How many chances do you get in your
life to haul a dinosaur?" he explained. Jim Alphonso,
assistant manager of the CMR Refuge, appeared, escorting
three gray-haired ladies from the town of Circle up the
still-slippery hill. The historian among them, Polly
Wischmann, said to me, "I don t really like it leaving, but a
lot more people will see it in Bozeman."
   The bones had been encased in a plaster-burlap wrap to
stabilize them, and the smaller ones had already been taken
down the hill. The two largest pieces, the cervical vertebrae
where the head and shoulders attach, and the pelvis, still
were in the pit. To remove them, a front-end loader and a
tilt-bed truck were provided by the Corps of Engineers, whose
usual duties here consist of building and maintaining the
dam, recreation sites and boat docks. Tom Wankel's flat-bed
farm truck was parked near the hill. Because the road
specially built by the Corps to get T. Rex out was impassable
by the semi, the two smaller trucks would transport the
dinosaur to it.
   Front-end loader operator Walt Murch manipulated that
large machine with infinite finesse, lifting the cervical
vertebrae cast so that timbers could be placed underneath,
giving the paleontologists room to work as they plastered the
bottom holes. Once the plaster was set, the front-end loader
gently placed it atop a wooden pallet around which the
loader's straps were wrapped and hooked onto the loader's
bucket. The bucket rose. The straps grew taut. The pallet was
lifted, and the loader maneuvered into a turn. Its huge
wheels skidded on the slimy mud as the loader carried its
large white bundle down the short but steep hill to the
truck. "One down," said Ed West, the Corps maintenance
foreman.
   I asked Mr. Murch what it felt like to be lifting dinosaur
bones. "Just like any other old rock," he said, smiling. "We
probably move them around all the time and don't even know
it."
   By noon work began on the largest piece, the huge section
of pelvic bones. When the loader attempted to carry it to the
truck it clearly was too heavy. Normally, the bucket can
handle about 8,000 pounds. This piece weighed 6,500 pounds,
but because the bucket was being used to lift rather than
carry, the balance was out of whack and the cast could not be
lifted high enough. Returned to place, the weight of it
pulled the back wheels of the front-end loader off the
ground, giving us some slight sense of T. Rex's power. The
situation was remedied by bringing the truck up the hill,
then placing it below the loader. The truck bed extended and
tilted and the two machines working delicately together got
the dinosaur onto the truck.
   Among the smaller pieces moved onto Tom's truck was part
of a Triceratops skull and horns. Triceratops are common
here. T. Rex ate them.
   The transfer of the bones to the semi was done a few miles
away. By the time all the pieces were in place and secured to
the truck it was almost 7 p.m. The sky had grayed. Rows of
lightning jagged across it in the distance. The men fought a
rising wind to tighten tarps across part of the load. In this
prelude to storm, the smell of sage was strong. A meadowlark
sang, its song swelling over the whirring motor of the semi.
The first drops of rain fell. And everything was ready. Pat
Leiggi climbed into the cab next to Bill McKamey and, after
65 million years, T. Rex took off down the road to Bozeman in
a cream-colored Kenworth.
   Visitors to the Museum of the Rockies will be able to

   Tokyo stock prices, after a strong advance on Tuesday,
fell sharply from intraday highs on Wednesday because of
arbitrage selling in the late afternoon.
   In London, share prices finished a listless session firmer
amid a dearth of corporate news to stimulate activity.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues closed at 30837.99, off
197.67 points. Near the end of the session, the index picked
up 100 points on index-linked buying to finish above intraday
lows. On Tuesday, the index advanced 592.71 points.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index fell
238.17 points to 30599.82.
   Wednesday's first section volume was estimated at 430
million shares, up from 382 million shares on Tuesday.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first section issues,
which gained 27.27 points on Tuesday, eased 5.88 to 2246.68.
The Second Section Index, which soared 73.33 points on
Tuesday, rose 13.93 to 4436.26. Second section volume was
estimated at 37.2 million shares, up from 29.8 million shares
a day earlier.
   The yen's strengthening against the dollar in Japan and
abroad, which was prompted by growing expectations for lower
U.S. interest rates, helped push up bond prices. Responding
favorably to the stabler bond market, the Nikkei Index
advanced 335 points early in the morning session. Despite the
Nikkei's gains, analysts said, the market lacked strength,
reflecting investors' perception that domestic interest rates
haven't peaked.
   Most investors held off from buying any stocks at prices
above levels considered to be "very good bargains," a trader
at Daiwa Securities Co. said. The market failed to sustain
the initial morning gains as the trading focus blurred, with
buying gradually spread over a wide range of issues, traders
said.
   Rounds of arbitrage selling in midafternoon were triggered
by a decline in the futures index, a trader said. This was a
reaction to reports linking the yen's strengthening against
the dollar to narrowing between Japanese and U.S. short-term
interest rates, which were at equal levels in the Euro money
market Tuesday for the first time since November 1985. This
in turn led to predictions that high Japanese interest rates
will discourage active participation by Japanese investors at
next week's U.S. Treasury bond auctions, observers said. Such
predictions, together with the dollar's weakness against most
major currencies, prompted speculation that the U.S. currency
may lose some credibility. The market also was affected by
speculation that the U.S. economy may be slowing down at a
faster pace than expected. All these speculations eventually
grew to rumors that New York stocks would plunge, traders
said.
   Advancing shares included interest rate-sensitive issues,
which were hunted for bargains, as they had been viewed as
oversold in the past week, and small-capitalization shares
with strong earnings outlooks, traders said.
   Daiwa Securities rose 30 yen to 1,330 yen ($9.12) a share.
Shipbuilding companies firmed, with IHI ending at 954, up 4.
   Kansai Electric Power rose 40 to 3,140, and Tokyo Electric
Power gained 60 to 3,930.
   Bridgestone rose 10 to 1,450 after predicting Tuesday that
pretax profit for the current fiscal year will increase 11%.
   Skylark advanced 100 to 3,630 on expectation of growing
sales and pretax earnings for the current fiscal year,
traders said. The gains encouraged buying of shares of other
restaurant chains.
   In London, shares were propelled higher from the start on
markups, stock-index futures buying, and a general shortage
of blue-chip leaders, dealers said. But the romp higher ran
out of steam, and stocks languished until midafternoon when
Wall Street opened, giving the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share Index a modest fillip.
   But generally, market professionals said, equities
suffered from a seasonal lack of investor interest and
activity as August began. Several sectors were strong, most
notably oil, but investors were keeping a watchful eye during
the afternoon on developments on Wall Street. New York
stocks, however, turned out to have little impact on London
participants.
   The FT-SE 100 closed at 2339.0, up 12.8 points, after
traveling between a minimum of 2329.3 and an intraday high of
2346.7. Volume was a moderate 419.2 million shares, compared
with 301.5 million shares a day earlier. The Financial Times
30-share index rose 8.3 points to 1852.8.
   The biggest gainer on the day was Enterprise Oil, up 17
pence at 668 pence ($12.46). Dealers said the stock benefited
from sharpened Mideast tensions and rumors that Atlantic
Richfield has expressed interest in buying the 25% stakes
that Imperial Chemical Industries of Britain and Elf
Aquitaine of France hold in Enterprise. But a meager 692,000
shares were traded.
   Other oil issues were boosted on news that reconciliation
talks between Kuwait and Iraq collapsed. Their two-week-old
dispute about oil, borders and money has been accompanied by
a show of Iraqi military strength at the borders. British
Petroleum gained 7 to 340. Shell Transport &amp; Trading rose 9
to 483.
   Abbey National gained 4 to 218 after posting a 39%
increase in interim pretax profit to #280 million ($522.2
million), in line with market expectations.
   Rank Organisation fell 9 to 754, and its takeover target,
Mecca, was unchanged at 80. The Department of Trade and
Industry said the deal would be referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission unless Rank moved to reduce the effect
of owning 60% of London bingo halls.
   Kingfisher fell 6 to 356. Morgan Stanley International
downgraded the retailer on concern about the outlook for its
property portfolio, given the slump in Britain's economy.
   Elsewhere, equity prices closed higher in Stockholm and
lower in Frankfurt, Paris, Brussels and Milan and were mixed
in Amsterdam. The Zurich market was closed for a holiday.
   Share prices closed higher in Hong Kong, Sydney,
Singapore, Taipei and Seoul, were mixed in Manila and ended
lower in Wellington.

   Foreign Exchange:
   Dollar Rises Across the Board as Dealers
   Take Their Profits on Tuesday's Sell-Off

   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose across the board as dealers
who had sold the currency against the mark Tuesday took
profits.
   But market participants agreed that the day's session
represented no long-term reversal in the dollar's fortunes.
The great bulk of dollar positions are short, they said, on
the belief that the U.S. currency is still headed for record
lows against its German counterpart.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5885
marks, up from 1.5869 marks late Tuesday. The U.S. currency
was also changing hands at 147.18 yen, above 145.80 yen in
New York late Tuesday. Sterling was trading at $1.8555, down
from $1.8640 late Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 147.05 yen almost an hour after the opening; it closed in
Tokyo Wednesday at 146.65 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency
was trading at about 1.5840 marks, down from Tokyo's
Wednesday close of 1.5938 marks.
   The dollar's value in recent days has been edging close to
the level of 1.5615 marks briefly seen on Jan. 4, 1988, which
was its lowest since the West German currency's creation
after World War II.
   Supporting their view that the dollar will continue to
soften against the mark, currency analysts and traders noted
that the dollar's gains were led by purchases with yen. The
U.S. currency climbed exactly two yen from its intraday low
of 145.60 yen at the start of Australian trading to its day's
high of 147.60 yen in the afternoon in New York.
   Against the German currency, the dollar peaked at 1.5948
marks just before the European close.
   Some U.S. corporations and speculators who tried to sell
dollars, however, were unable to get their orders executed
before London closed and liquidity dried up, according to
Keith Raphael, a Chase Manhattan vice president for foreign
exchange. Left on their own, he said, New York market makers
had to bring the dollar's price down to find enough buyers
for the backlog of sellers.
   "Because the pressure on the dollar is still strong, it
looks like it'll fall again" today, said Kenichiro Takeda, a
senior dealer and trading manager at Mitsubishi Trust in
Tokyo.
   "The market's frustrated that it can't reach the lows,"
another Tokyo dealer said, bemoaning the part the Asian
market played in interrupting the dollar's decline. "The
downside still has a lot of potential for investors to take
profits."
   But even investors who agree on the dollar's bleak
prospects bought it yesterday.
   Explained a foreign exchange trader in Paris, "The dollar
fell too far too fast {Tuesday} and was due for a
correction."
   The desire to chalk up profits was strong yesterday even
though monthly books had been closed the day before, said
Alan Leventen, managing director of financial services for
Balfour, Maclaine Futures in New York.
   The next opportunity for pocketing gains, he said, will
come tomorrow, when the U.S. releases its July employment
statistics. Mr. Leventen said profit-taking pressure on any
downward tick in the dollar may leave it higher at the end of
the day, even if the jobs report is dismal.
   In fact, in selling their non-dollar currencies yesterday,
dealers and investors ignored added evidence of U.S. economic
stagnation.
   The July purchasing managers' index fell to 47.4% after
three months of gains. A reading below 50% indicates
manufacturing is in decline. The index had been expected to
read 50.8% for the month.
   The June leading indicators index, meanwhile, was
unchanged after a revised 0.7% gain in May.
   A weaker dollar may be favored by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, which is under pressure to spur economic expansion.
   "A lower dollar is the equivalent of lower interest
rates," Chase's Mr. Raphael said. "I doubt we'll see another
easing in credit policy before October. Instead, the Fed will
hope weak fundamentals will weaken the dollar enough to
improve the trade deficit." The resulting rise in exports
would be a welcome boost for the U.S. economy, he said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $373.30 an ounce, up $3.30. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$374.75 an ounce.

   Schering-Plough Interferon Drug Shows
   Promise Treating Hepatitis B in Study
   ----

   More than one-third of patients afflicted with chronic
hepatitis B were treated successfully with Schering-Plough
Corp.'s version of interferon, a large team of medical
researchers reported.
   The report is the first time researchers have claimed
success in treating a form of hepatitis that afflicts about
5% of the world's population. It is the most serious form of
hepatitis in that many infected persons develop a chronic
form of hepatitis in which the virus continues to multiply in
the liver for years afterward, often leading to cirrhosis or
liver cancer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The researchers reported that daily injections of
interferon for 16 weeks stopped the hepatitis B virus from
multiplying in 40% of the patients who had suffered a chronic
state of active virus infection and hepatitis for as long as
seven years.
   Most of the patients who were successfully treated
apparently became "silent" or inactive carriers of the
hepatitis B virus. But in 10% of the patients, most of whom
had had hepatitis B for less than two years, the interferon
treatment appeared to eliminate the virus, the researchers
reported.
   "We can cure people who might otherwise have a lifelong
infection with serious consequences if we get to them early
enough," said Robert P. Perrillo, associate professor of
medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Perrillo
headed the team of scientists from a dozen medical schools
and Schering-Plough who tested the interferon treatment.
   Hepatitis B, once known as serum hepatitis, is transmitted
sexually, through contaminated needles, through blood
transfusions or from infected mother to child. It differs
from hepatitis A, which is usually transmitted in
sewage-contaminated food. In the U.S., hepatitis B afflicts
less than 1% of the population and is most often seen in
sexually promiscuous people, homosexual males, drug addicts,
health care workers and infants born to mothers who are
carriers. In parts of Africa and Asia, however, hepatitis B
afflicts and is carried by about 20% of the population.
   The report, published in this week's issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine, is the second coup in as many
days for Schering-Plough's interferon alfa-2b, which it sells
under the brand name Intron A. Tuesday, an advisory group of
medical experts recommended that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approve the company's request to sell Intron A
for the treatment of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis, a
catchall designation for hepatitis in which blood tests fail
to detect the A or B virus.
   A company spokesman said Schering-Plough applied to the
FDA last October for clearance to make claims that Intron A
was effective in hepatitis B but hasn't yet received such
approval. It took 13 months for the approval of Intron A's
use in non-A, non-B hepatitis.
   The interferon treatment isn't cheap. The Schering-Plough
spokesman said that the average retail cost to the patient
would be about $5,000 for the full 16-week course of shots
used in the hepatitis B experiment.
   Schering-Plough's interferon alfa-2b is one of two
genetically engineered interferons on the market. Roche
Holdings Ltd.'s Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, N.J., sells
interferon alfa-2a, which has some slight molecular
differences from the Schering-Plough product. Both
interferons are sold for the treatment of a type of leukemia
and for the Kaposi's sarcoma cancer that hits many patients
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The tests of interferon alfa-2b in hepatitis B involved
169 patients who had had chronic hepatitis B for at least six
months. Because the outward clinical symptoms of the disease
vary widely from none to severe fatigue, the diagnosis of
hepatitis B was confirmed in liver biopsies and by blood
tests that indicated the virus was actively multiplying in
the liver.
   In the experiment, 85 of the patients were taught to give
themselves daily shots of five million units of interferon
for 16 weeks. Periodic blood tests over the following months
indicated that in 31 of these patients, the virus had quit
multiplying in the liver. In addition, the blood tests on 10
of the patients indicated the virus had disappeared.
   By contrast, of 43 patients whose daily shots were of a
placebo or inert substance, only three showed a spontaneous
loss of virus multiplication, and blood tests indicated all
continued to harbor the virus. Another set of 41 patients
received only one million units of interferon daily. In this
group the virus became inactive in seven and disappeared in
one patient.
   Half of the patients receiving the maximum five million
units of interferon also had been pretreated with a steroid
hormone that had shown some benefit in other forms of
hepatitis. The steroid treatment, however, seemed to make
little difference in the overall results.
   So far, only two patients have experienced a reactivation
of the virus, although the researchers cautioned that a
long-term follow-up is needed to determine the treatment's
efficacy and to find out whether it reduces the risk of
cirrhosis and liver cancer.
   The major adverse effects of the interferon treatment were
changes in appetite, insomnia, acne and flu-like symptoms
such as fatigue, fever and headache.

   WASHINGTON -- In her 2 1/2 years as chairman of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Wendy Gramm has made
her share of enemies.
   The Chicago commodity exchanges dislike her stand on
trading rules. Securities and Exchange Commission officials
criticize her view of the markets. Congressional leaders
rudely question whether she works full time at her job. And
the White House recently waged an aggressive campaign to take
away a chunk of her agency's clout, despite repeated support
for her personally.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The upshot of all this: Later today, a Senate committee is
expected to vote overwhelmingly to grant her another term at
the helm of the commodities regulator. Just when it appeared
as though Mrs. Gramm's appointment to the CFTC was becoming
an embarrassment to the Bush administration, she has emerged
from her first stint as chairman stronger and better
respected than ever.
   "It seems to me that we need strong leadership at the
CFTC, and Wendy's improving strength will be essential," says
Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, a former foe turned friend, and
the ranking Republican on the Agriculture Committee, which
oversees the CFTC.
   Mrs. Gramm's resurgence as a shoo-in for another term
stems in part from her political connections -- which include
a husband who's an influential senator -- and in part from
signs of new vitality at the CFTC.
   A colleague of then-Vice President George Bush on a
deregulation task force when she was at the Office of
Management and Budget, she became an avid supporter in his
presidential campaign. Her adopted Texas roots (she was born
in Hawaii) don't hurt in the current administration, either.
But the 45-year-old Mrs. Gramm also has helped herself,
becoming a feisty CFTC chairman in the past few months. (Mrs.
Gramm declined to be interviewed for this article.)
   The oft-maligned agency has rebounded from a host of
public blunders to press some major enforcement actions.
Earlier this week, the CFTC filed charges against a company
part-owned by Karsten Mahlmann, who resigned yesterday as
chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, one of the most
important markets the CFTC oversees. Although Mr. Mahlmann
wasn't named in the CFTC complaint, the charges were
considered to be a major factor in his decision to resign.
   Through it all, there is her husband, influential Sen.
Phil Gramm, who, like the president, is a Texas Republican. A
fierce defender of his wife -- and valued confidant of Mr.
Bush -- Sen. Gramm is the backstop of Mrs. Gramm's strength.
   "It has to be a pretty blatant problem for the Senate not
to go along with the administration's choice," says Rep.
Glenn English (D., Okla.), who heads the House subcommittee
overseeing the CFTC. "When the Senate has to deal with a
member of a senator's family, that compounds the problem to a
certain degree."
   While that isn't exactly a ringing endorsement, Mrs. Gramm
also has managed to convert many of those who sought a
tougher commodities regulator just a year ago. It was shortly
after that time that Sen. Lugar headed for the White House to
raise questions about whether Mrs. Gramm was right for the
CFTC job.
   It's easy to understand why. In the spring of 1989, the
commodities markets were embroiled in scandal after an
undercover operation at the Chicago exchanges led to 16
guilty pleas and 32 other indictments. The traders' alleged
crimes: cheating customers in the same commodities pits that
the CFTC was created to patrol.
   Senators pointedly asked where the agency had been. Mrs.
Gramm's answers didn't come easily or clearly. There was "an
inability to brief {Agriculture Committee Chairman} Sen.
{Patrick} Leahy or me comprehensively," recalls Sen. Lugar.
   Things got worse. That July, the Chicago Board of Trade,
with the CFTC's knowledge, ordered a huge buyer of soybean
futures, Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A., to divest itself of its
holdings, in turn sending the price of soybeans plummeting.
Farm-state legislators heard howls from agonized constituents
and quickly scheduled hearings.
   Before a House panel, Mrs. Gramm defended the Board of
Trade's actions, adding that her agency had consulted many
times with the exchange. Just days later, though, the
exchange chairman told stunned subcommittee members that the
CFTC itself had directed Ferruzzi to sell some of its
soybean-futures holdings hours before the board issued its
mandate.
   The congressmen were livid. "I don't think there's a
logical explanation for misleading the committee,"
subcommittee Chairman English said at the time. "And some
members think she went further than misleading." A CFTC
spokeswoman later said that Mrs. Gramm didn't disclose the
action because a statement "might become a market factor."
   But clearly the incident violated a cardinal rule of
congressional relations: Do it behind closed doors if you
have to, but keep members informed of sensitive subjects. For
a subsequent Senate hearing on the same subject, Mrs. Gramm
sent another commissioner instead, citing a busy schedule.
"That was a very unsatisfying experience for most of us,"
Sen. Lugar recalls.
   Other appearances on Capitol Hill didn't win Mrs. Gramm
many friends either. Her style was often stilted and obtuse,
and she tried to bring obscure economic theory to legislators
who just wanted simple answers.
   In a particularly embarrassing episode, Sen. Bob Kerrey
(D., Neb.) asked her whether she worked full time at her job.
A weak answer incited the senator to pose the question again
and again, forcing Mrs. Gramm to repeatedly deny that she did
work for her husband in Texas. At another hearing, in an
unusual show of senatorial discourtesy, Sen. Slade Gorton
(R., Wash.) browsed through the Washington Post sports
section as Mrs. Gramm testified.
   Then this spring the administration, led by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, launched a campaign to wrest some
of the CFTC's supervision away from the agency and give it to
the SEC. At issue were stock-index futures, a commodity
product that allows investors to bet on the movement of a
basket of stocks without owning the stocks themselves.
   For a time the battle appeared grim, with the chairman of
one of the administration's smallest agencies taking on some
of the White House's heaviest hitters. But Mrs. Gramm hung
tough, aided by futures executives and Agriculture Committee
members, and it now appears that she has won the battle and
will retain supervision of stock-index futures.
   The fight also represents a turning point for Mrs. Gramm.
Following a pep talk from Sen. Lugar, her congressional
testimony got sharper. Her arguments became clearer, her
presentation more authoritative. At one hearing, she openly
sparred with SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, concluding that if
there were enforcement problems between the stock and futures
markets, it was because the SEC wasn't minding its store.
   Her new gumption is gaining her praise from her fellow
CFTC commissioners. "She's very bright, very tough. I
probably mean tough in the good sense of the word," says CFTC
member William Albrecht. "She fights hard for what she
wants."

   TORONTO -- Aur Resources Inc. said it reached a settlement
in a legal dispute over the ownership of a large copper and
zinc deposit it discovered in northern Quebec.
   The agreement, reached between Aur, its partner Louvem
Inc. and Louvem's parent, St. Genevieve Resources Inc., gives
Aur a 60% stake in the deposit, called the Louvicourt
property, hailed as one of the largest base metals
discoveries in Canada in recent years. Louvem will own the
remaining 40% of the property.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Louvem agreed to transfer a 10% working interest in the
Louvicourt property to Aur in exchange for five million
Canadian dollars (US$4.3 million) and a 2.5% interest in the
deposit's net profits. Aur agreed to pay a further C$7
million to Louvem, half when commercial production at the
property reaches a level of 10,000 tons a day and the
remainder on the first anniversary of that date.
   The companies said the settlement is conditional on
approval required by Louvem and St. Genevieve from a Noranda
Inc. unit, or on Noranda and St. Genevieve holding a combined
interest of less than 50% of Louvem. Noranda holds a 22%
stake in Louvem and 19% of St. Genevieve, which in turns owns
56% of Louvem.
   St. Genevieve said it advised Noranda of its plan to sell
up to 4.1 million Louvem shares at C$8 each. If Noranda
doesn't exercise its right of first refusal to buy those
shares, and enough are sold to reduce the combined holdings
of the two companies in Louvem below the 50% threshold, the
agreement will take effect.

   Cigna Profit Rose
   In Quarter by 7%;

   Cigna Corp.'s second-quarter net income rose 7% to $158
million, or $2.05 a share, while Travelers Corp.'s net
dropped nearly 11% to $102 million, or 98 cents a share.
   While both companies saw earnings increase for their
employee benefits and group-health business, the continued
pricing war in the property/casualty area hurt their results.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The lack of improvement in property and casualty industry
pricing conditions will constrain both 1990 and 1991 results,
said Wilson H. Taylor, Cigna's chairman and chief executive
officer. Cigna, based in Philadelphia, said property/casualty
operating profit fell to $17 million from $27 million a year
ago.
   As a way of improving results in this market segment,
Cigna plans to accelerate the previously announced
consolidation of its domestic property/casualty field
offices. Later this year, the company expects to take a
charge of no more than $65 million, on an after-tax basis, to
reflect these consolidation costs.
   Consolidated revenue at Cigna rose 26% to $4.8 billion in
the second quarter. For the six months, net fell 13% to $200
million on revenue of $8.7 billion, which rose 16% from the
1989 first half.
   Travelers Chairman Edward H. Budd said that the company
has taken on a number of programs to reduce operating costs
and improve the quality of its book of business in the
property/casualty area. During the second quarter, the
company restructured its agent commission schedule to provide
agents with incentives for bringing in higher-quality
automobile insurance business. Travelers, based in Hartford,
Conn., also announced plans to withdraw from the personal
lines market from nine states.
   While net from Travelers' commercial property/casualty
business rose 23% to $65 million, partly due to realized
capital gains of $20 million, earnings from its personal
property/casualty lines plunged to $300,000 from $6 million a
year earlier.
   Travelers also said its results were adversely affected by
continued underperforming real estate assets. While real
estate conditions had improved in the Southwest, the company
said markets continued to soften in other areas. The company
is continuing its program for restructuring loans, property
sales and the management of foreclosed properties to maximize
value longer term.
   Travelers' second-quarter revenue fell to $3 billion from
$3.2 billion a year ago. For the six months, earnings fell to
$193 million, or $1.85 a share, from $212 million, or $2.06 a
share.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Cigna closed at $47.25, up 25 cents, while Travelers closed
unchanged at $27.375. The news concerning Cigna was released
after Big Board trading had ended for the day.

   WASHINGTON -- Late in 1988, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev was having lunch with President Reagan and
President-elect Bush and explaining the trouble facing him in
implementing his ambitious reforms. Finally, Mr. Bush spoke
up in a tough tone: What assurances could the Soviet leader
offer Americans that these reforms would succeed? Testily,
Mr. Gorbachev retorted: "Not even Jesus Christ knows the
answer to your question."
   It was the sort of tense exchange that had longed marked
U.S.-Soviet relations. Today, it shows how far the
Bush-Gorbachev personal relationship -- arguably the world's
most important -- has come. The relationship has moved,
sometimes fitfully, from wariness to warmth, and is now
probably the closest ever between a Soviet and an American
leader.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bush, who was initially a skeptic and who was accused
of dragging his feet in responding to Mr. Gorbachev, now is
an enthusiast criticized for growing too attached to him. Mr.
Gorbachev has evolved from a polemicist whose conversations
were colored by Communist ideology into a leader who recently
flew by helicopter over Washington's suburbs and peppered Mr.
Bush with questions about buying and selling houses in a
capitalist system.
   Mr. Bush, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal
about his relationship with the Soviet leader, talked of how
he and Mr. Gorbachev have used extensive personal
conversations, private correspondence and a process of sizing
up each other from afar to forge a cooperative relationship.
Among other things, Mr. Bush disclosed how the two leaders
exchanged private letters in 1989, setting the stage for
their future face-to-face meetings.
   Mr. Bush says he slowly became a believer during 1989, as
he watched the Soviet leader let Eastern Europe peel away
from the Soviet empire. "I don't think I ever was down on
Gorbachev or negative about him," Mr. Bush said in the
interview. "But what I think has changed was the whole
Eastern European scene. And we had communications with him
during a lot of this period of change, quiet communications,
letters that we didn't feel inclined to discuss a lot. And I
think, from my standpoint, I saw a man who was trying very
hard to go forward with reform. And as one event after
another affirmed that, why more confidence grew up."
   Mr. Gorbachev, in turn, appears to have become a believer
in Mr. Bush when, aboard a Soviet cruise ship off Malta last
December, the president plopped down a list of more than a
dozen steps he was willing to take to help close arms-control
deals with Moscow and pull the Kremlin into the world
economy. "I came knowing your support for perestroika, and I
was going to ask you for specifics," Mr. Gorbachev said,
according to American officials at the meeting. "Now you've
given them."
   Today, U.S. officials claim that the trust the two have
developed was instrumental in Mr. Gorbachev's historic
announcement two weeks ago that he will accept a united
Germany inside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   At the Washington summit meeting two months ago, "we
talked in a wonderfully relaxed way" about Soviet fears that
a united Germany in NATO would threaten Moscow, Mr. Bush
says. He says he stressed that "we weren't interested in
having them worry all the time about a NATO aggression
against them . . . and I think he saw we were sincere about
it."
   Skeptics, however, say the Soviets were persuaded much
more by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his potential
billions in aid than by Mr. Bush's sincerity.
   More broadly, conservative critics charge that Mr. Bush
has tied American policy too closely to Mr. Gorbachev, whom
they consider an erratic and timid reformer. They argue that
Mr. Bush is closing the door to alternative leaders, such as
Boris Yeltsin, who would make more radical Western-style
reforms.
   "We've thought for a long time that he was over-investing
in Gorbachev," says Frank Gaffney, a Reagan administration
Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy, a
conservative think tank. "If anything, he is now helping to
prop up the principal figure in the Soviet Union who is
acting as a restraint on radical, fundamental reform there."
   What's more, such critics complain, the president's ties
to Mr. Gorbachev have made it impossible for Mr. Bush to sell
his own defense budget in Congress, because lawmakers don't
sense a Soviet threat when leaders are so chummy.
   Mr. Bush replies that he has little choice but to deal
with the Soviet leader he finds in power -- and that it is to
his benefit to build good working ties with whoever that is.
"He's the guy in charge, he's the guy I'll deal with," Mr.
Bush says. "When he's not sitting there I'll be dealing with
whoever is sitting in that chair."
   Mr. Bush also indicates he is willing to open lines to
Gorbachev foes, noting that he just met with the prime
minister of the breakaway Baltic republic of Latvia. He says
he "undoubtedly" would be willing to meet with Gorbachev
opponents whenever he travels to Moscow for another summit.
(Tensions between Mr. Gorbachev and his opponents actually
may be easing; he and Mr. Yeltsin have formed a committee to
develop a common plan for further reforms of the Soviet
economy.)
   There also seem to be distinct limits in the relationship
between Mr. Bush and the Soviet leader. Mr. Bush continues to
resist any direct U.S. financial aid for the gasping Soviet
economy, and American officials say Mr. Gorbachev hasn't
directly asked for any, perhaps fearing rejection.
   Still, Mr. Bush seems happy that it is Mr. Gorbachev he is
dealing with: "I must say I enjoy being with him and I
certainly don't dislike him," he says.
   In the last eight months alone the two have held more than
20 hours of talks during two summits. And where personal
telephone conversations between superpower leaders once were
virtually unheard of, these two have talked by phone three
times this year already.
   At first glance, it seems that there isn't much in common
between the 66-year-old Mr. Bush, a prudent leader who was
reared in well-manicured Greenwich, Conn., and the
59-year-old Mr. Gorbachev, a flamboyant risk-taker who hails
from the peasant farms of southern Russia.
   Yet there are similarities. Both are called pragmatic, a
term neither regards as pejorative. And they share a
seemingly endless reservoir of nervous energy. "These are
compatible personalities in the sense that both are
high-energy people, restless," says national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft.
   Interviews with a number of past and present U.S.
officials, as well as with Mr. Bush himself, indicate there
was little hint of the historic changes in store when the two
men were first introduced in 1985 at the funeral of
Konstantin Chernenko, Mr. Gorbachev's predecessor.
   After the funeral, Vice President Bush met with the new
Soviet leader for half an hour in an elaborate, gilded
conference room in the Kremlin. Americans who attended the
meeting say that, aside from a vague comment about how the
"old powers" could no longer control other nations, Mr.
Gorbachev gave no sign of any plan for the sweeping
reconstruction of Soviet policy that was to unfold in the
next five years.
   There was an inkling of the Gorbachev sense of humor, Mr.
Bush recalls, when his host rolled his eyes as a translator
seemed especially slow at one point. "He could also be tough
as hell, as I saw there," Mr. Bush says, and grew especially
agitated over U.S. questions about human rights inside the
Soviet Union.
   When Mr. Gorbachev visited the U.S. for a 1987 summit
meeting, he showed his feel for American politics by
pointedly asking for a private meeting with then-candidate
George Bush. Then the Soviet leader displayed some political
showmanship of his own when, as the two were riding together
in a limousine through downtown Washington, he leapt out at a
street corner and began shaking hands.
   "I thought, `Here's a guy that really likes the smell of
grease paint and the roar of the crowd. He's just like one of
us politicians,'" the president recalls.
   Mr. Bush was president-elect the next time the two met,
when they had their tense exchange about Mr. Gorbachev's odds
for success. When Mr. Bush took office in 1989 a more serious
sizing up began -- and more tensions emerged.
   Mr. Bush, voicing skepticism about the depth of change in
the Soviet Union, set out on a go-slow approach and ordered a
series of "policy reviews" on the situation. Mr. Gorbachev
grumbled to other leaders about Mr. Bush's caution.
   But that began changing -- secretly -- in July 1989. Mr.
Bush paid a visit to Eastern Europe, where officials of the
newly democratic nations of Poland and Hungary sang Mr.
Gorbachev's praises and urged the U.S. to support him. So on
his way home from Europe, Mr. Bush sat down in Air Force One
and wrote a letter to Mr. Gorbachev suggesting an informal
get-together -- a suggestion that led to last December's
Malta summit.
   There, Mr. Bush became a clear booster of perestroika, Mr.
Gorbachev's reform program. As he sat down at a table on the
Soviet cruise ship Gorky for a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev,
Mr. Bush laid out his two typewritten pages of proposals. For
the next hour, he sketched out a plan for closing a series of
arms-control deals, negotiating a new U.S.-Soviet trade
relationship and drawing the Soviets into the Western trade
and banking systems.
   Though the Bush-Gorbachev relationship was beginning to
take shape, it didn't fully develop in Malta, for gale-force
winds cut short their time together. Moreover, a dispute
still festered over Soviet shipments to Cuba of arms that
were reportedly being transshipped to leftist rebels in El
Salvador. Then, soon after Malta, a serious storm cloud took
shape: Mr. Gorbachev imposed an economic stranglehold on
Lithuania, the first Soviet republic to seek independence.
   With these tensions in mind, Mr. Bush plotted a way to
work on his personal chemistry with Mr. Gorbachev at this
spring's Washington summit: He insisted that one day be set
aside for private talks at Camp David.
   The weighty issues of arms control and Germany were
handled in two days of Oval Office meetings. Mr. Bush heard
what he considered reassuring words about Lithuania. "We
talked at length about Lithuania and the Baltic States, and
his pointing out to me that, `Look, the constitution provides
for secession. . . . We've got the provisions for that. We
just want the law abided by.' Who would have thought a Soviet
leader would be talking like that, back when I first met
Gorbachev?" And, in perhaps the most notable sign of their
growing cooperation, Mr. Gorbachev, who is setting up a
powerful new presidency of his own, asked to send his top
aide to the White House for some organizational pointers. Mr.
Bush said yes.
   Then the two boarded a helicopter and flew on a Saturday
morning to the seclusion of Camp David. Mr. Bush wasn't sure
the Soviet leader would warm to the idea. "We were told he
won't ride in a helicopter, certainly won't want to go for a
walk. He's a formal kind of guy," Mr. Bush says. "Next thing
you know we have our ties off and (are) sitting in a
beautiful setting and (going) for a walk on the trails
there."
   For most of the day, both leaders sat at a round patio
table, aides at their side, and talked. They discussed
Afghanistan and the Middle East, and they sparred over Cuba.
Mr. Bush declared that relations between the U.S. and the
Soviet Union can't be "totally normal" until the Kremlin
stops providing $5 billion worth of aid annually to Fidel
Castro; Mr. Gorbachev talked only vaguely of putting
relations with Cuba on a "commercial basis" that would
curtail some subsidies. There was no solution, but Mr. Bush
says "I confidently expect" a change.
   One incident during the retreat stands out in the minds of
American officials. At a break in the talks, Mr. Gorbachev
wandered off and came upon the pit where Mr. Bush indulges
his passion for pitching horseshoes. Mr. Gorbachev picked up
a horseshoe -- and threw a ringer. Mr. Bush, learning of the
episode, ordered aides to retrieve the horseshoe and mount it
on a plaque.
   That night, at an informal dinner, Mr. Bush gave the
horseshoe to the Soviet leader. Mr. Gorbachev was moved and
responded with an emotional speech of thanks that drew on the
meaning of a horseshoe as a good-luck symbol in Russian as
well as American culture. "I hope this means good luck on my
house and good luck on your houses, good luck on your people
and good luck on my people," he said.

   Congress Forgets the Meaning of Defense

   At the 1987 Washington summit, Soviet spokesman Georgi
Arbatov posed a rhetorical question: "What will you do when
we deny you an enemy?" Three years later, U.S. policymakers
seem to believe they are now confronting that problem.
   Several weeks ago, the Senate Armed Services Committee
completed work on a major defense bill that cancels or
severely cripples a number of important strategic programs.
On Tuesday, the House Armed Services Committee marked up a
defense bill that could do yet more damage to national
security. The trouble here is that no one is asking whether
the Soviets are merely denying us the perception of an enemy.
The Soviets may even be doing so in order to undermine the
American consensus for a strong defense. Soviet success in
any case shows that lawmakers' will to believe in Mikhail
Gorbachev's benign intentions is too strong.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Defense Department is, of course, certainly not
entitled to a blank check. Reasonable cuts in defense
spending are the necessary response to the world's changing
military and political situation, and to our own deficit
woes. But the Pentagon is not a cash cow to be milked to
nourish a bloated welfare state. Its mission is to safeguard
our freedom by keeping our military forces strong and ready.
   Take a look at history. Every time the U.S. has embarked
on a drastic unilateral reduction in military capability for
a short-term gain, the ultimate result has been a high cost
-- in American blood as well as treasure.
   We were woefully unprepared when we entered World War I.
Recruits drilled with broomsticks instead of rifles, and the
U.S. had to borrow artillery, tanks and aircraft from the
French and British. In the 1930s, isolationism gave us a weak
military. With Pearl Harbor, we learned the cost. U.S.
submarines went to war with torpedos that would not explode
on contact. Our aviators and their obsolete aircraft were
shot down in scores by Japanese pilots flying modern Zeros.
After World War II, the lesson repeated itself. The U.S.
demobilized precipitously and announced that it had no
security interest in East Asia. The result was the North
Korean invasion of South Korea 40 years ago this summer, and
the death of 50,000 Americans.
   Congress today is overlooking the high price of
unpreparedness in its zeal to spend the peace dividend --
before there is a dividend, and before there is true and
certain peace.
   The defense legislation pending in the House would
terminate the B-2 Stealth bomber program and stall the
modernization of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The
legislation in the Senate also stops modernization of ICBMs.
There is no strategic rationale for these steps. The process
that produced the legislation was not a thoughtful exercise
in defense policy analysis, but an accountant's exercise. The
very term "peace dividend" is the language of accountants. So
it should come as no surprise that Congress is acting with
little consideration of specific threats, strategic
imperatives or military requirements. The result is strategy
made by bookkeepers.
   The most glaring example of the triumph of short-term
politics over sound defense policy is the attitude toward
strategic programs, space and the Strategic Defense
Initiative. Even though the Warsaw Pact may no longer pose
the threat of conventional war for NATO, the Soviet threat at
the strategic end of the warfare spectrum remains real. The
Soviets are modernizing and expanding their nuclear arsenal.
Their military space program and their own "Star Wars" plans
continue unabated.
   Yet in Washington, the committee mark-up sessions and the
legislation that followed showed no concern over the use of
nuclear power for diplomatic leverage or blackmail. The
sessions have ignored the possibility that the Soviets are
merely following one of their old military doctrines:
"victory without war." One way to explain American failure to
aid Lithuania's freedom struggle -- morally or financially --
is that the U.S. is already intimidated by the Soviet nuclear
arsenal. Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, has made many speeches and issued many statements
explaining the Senate bill's strategy, but not one discusses
the critical importance of space to U.S. security and
prosperity -- an astonishing omission for any strategy that
claims to "look forward, not backward."
   In a trip to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
February, President Bush said, "In the 1990s, strategic
defense makes more sense than ever before." But the Senate
Armed Services Committee authorized nearly a billion dollars
less than the president's SDI request. The House Armed
Services Committee proposes to cut SDI by nearly $2 billion.
When the two chambers split the difference, the result could
be a major reduction in SDI funding, an actual decline in
real dollars, not merely a cut in the planned increase.
   There are worse prospects for SDI than reduced funding.
Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.) and Sen. Richard Shelby (D.,
Ala.) intend to offer an amendment to the Senate defense bill
that would radically restructure SDI. This comes at the
moment when the program stands on the threshold of producing
concrete benefits. By cutting $400 million from Phase I of
SDI and "brilliant pebbles," the most promising near-term
technology, the amendment would foreclose the deployment of
an actual defense system, and steer SDI toward long-term,
open-ended research. The senators would sacrifice the Defense
Department's freedom to manage the program efficiently, and
allocate the bulk of funds to established interests --
interests not coincidentally located in New Mexico and
Alabama.
   Sen. Nunn has predicted that a "broad national debate" on
strategic defense will result from this amendment. He's quite
right. The American people will have the chance to decide
whether they want SDI to become a technological welfare
program, or whether they want to get any return -- in the
form of an actual defense -- from the six years and nearly
$20 billion invested in SDI. They must decide through their
elected representatives whether to ensure by law that SDI
will never produce any real security and will instead become
merely another expensive entitlement program.
   Ironically, scientists and engineers working on SDI don't
favor pure research either. They, too, hope for a usable
product. In a recent report for the Strategic Defense
Initiative Organization, leading scientists from both Los
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories agree
that "Brilliant Pebbles offers effective and survivable
space-based means for addressing near- and long-term missile
threats in the boost phase."
   Building on the steady and dramatic technical progress to
date, and under the Strategic Defense Initiative
Organization's new director, Henry Cooper, there is the real
possibility that SDI funds will be spent to build the
protection that the American people think they have been
paying for all along -- unless Congress passes the
Bingaman-Shelby Amendment into law.
   If we turn our backs on SDI, we're not just rejecting the
option of defense against ballistic missiles. SDI also means
progress in the critical arena of space. It is significant
that the Senate defense bill would also terminate the MILSTAR
space-based command and control program, and that Sens. John
Kerry (D., Mass.) and Tom Harkin (D., Iowa) want to kill off
our anti-satellite capability as well.
   As long as there is conflict between competing interests
and ideologies, space will not be exempt from it. Indeed, we
are entering an era when space control is becoming the
crucial military leverage, and may determine the course of
future conflicts -- without a shot ever being fired by
terrestrial forces.
   Military forces have historically opened the way into new
frontiers of human endeavor, whether it was navies opening up
the high seas, or, as in our own history, the Army exploring
the new Western frontier, and providing security for
settlers, homesteaders and railroads.
   There is no reason the development of the space frontier
should not follow the same pattern. The military's initial
investment and sustained operations in space will push
technology forward, bring down the cost of launching and
keeping platforms in orbit, and provide the nucleus of future
settlements and commercial ventures. As in the past, "trade
will follow the flag."
   The first step toward the essential mastery of space is
SDI, the greatest technical and strategic innovation of the
past quarter century. A strategic defense system will greatly
reduce the military utility or blackmail potential of
nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. But SDI will give us more
than just a missile defense. It will also lead the way to
U.S. dominance in the ultimate high ground of space, and the
"high seas" of the future.
   The list of civil and commercial as well as military
benefits to be gained from space is endless. But the
investments will be, shall we say, astronomical. Can we
expect businesses to risk huge investments in space unless
their security is reasonably assured, unless U.S. interests
in space can be defended as they are on the earth's surface?
If congressional leaders, especially leaders of the armed
services committees, allow Congress to forestall the
immeasurable advantages of a space-based strategic defense,
then their pretensions to the role of strategist ring hollow.
   As Congress takes up action on the defense bill, the
American people need to remind their representatives that
American moral strength, political resolve, military
capability and technical prowess over the past 40 years have
brought us to the threshold of victory. When we are so close
to seeing the end of Soviet imperialism, the dividend ought
to be more than a transitory or illusory peace. By our
continued resolve, peace, when it comes, will be genuine and
lasting.

   New Trade Pact
   Set With Japan

   WASHINGTON -- Japan has agreed to give U.S. vendors
greater opportunities to sell certain telecommunications
terminal equipment and data-transmission services to Japanese
customers, U.S. trade officials said.
   The U.S. negotiators wrung these pledges from officials of
the Japanese Ministry of Post and Telecommunications just
hours before a deadline set for the White House to determine
whether Japan is abiding by a number of telecommunications
accords with the U.S. The deadline was set by mutual
agreement by the U.S. and Japan. The concessions made by
Japan avert threatened trade sanctions against that country,
according to the U.S. trade office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills called the Japanese
agreement a "major breakthrough," asserting that U.S.
manufacturing, financial and other firms that require
communications services in Japan "should be able to run those
operations more easily and economically."
   The latest commitments give U.S. companies the right to
sell network channel terminating equipment, or NCTEs,
directly to Japanese customers, instead of through common
carriers such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone
Corp. as required by current regulations. U.S. trade
officials estimate the initial U.S. market share at $150
million annually but much larger in the future.
   NCTEs are similar to the modems used to transmit data over
telephone lines. These devices enable users of
personal-computer networks to exchange digitalized data.
Direct access to Japanese customers could stimulate the U.S.
sales of NCTEs because of the technical superiority of the
U.S. products.
   In another major concession, Tokyo has agreed to scrap
several barriers to its market for international value-added
networks, or IVANs. Such networks are the vehicles through
which electronic banking, voice mail, and other
communications services are conducted across national
boundaries.
   The agreement gives U.S. providers of IVANs a shorter wait
for approval -- 30 days instead of several months -- and
removes the 20% surcharges that typically are levied by
common carriers for the lease of their lines. Although the
IVANs mostly link customers in the U.S. and Japan, the latest
package gives Japan-based U.S. providers the right to service
other countries.
   U.S. providers currently have a fraction of Japan's $750
million annual IVAN market, but their share could grow
sharply as a result of the agreement, U.S. officials
predicted.

   Salomon to Squeeze
   Philipp Unit, May
   Weigh Selling It

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc. plans further cutbacks in the
staff and assets of Philipp Brothers Inc. and may even
consider a sale of the unprofitable commodities unit.
   The expected move follows the most recent dismal results
at Philipp Brothers, which last week posted a pretax loss of
$62 million, its sixth consecutive quarterly deficit. That
brought total losses so far this year to $83 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Modest losses had not been liked, but were acceptable,"
James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., said.
"This is big red ink," he added. "That's not acceptable."
   Salomon, a big securities firm known for its bond-trading
skills, has long been paring its commodities business and has
talked of casting it off for more than two years. But Salomon
executives said that they are finally fed up now, and that
big changes are on the way. "This . . . has got to stop," a
Salomon executive said. "Enough already."
   Salomon has a profitable oil trading and refining
business, Phibro Energy Inc. But success has eluded the
Philipp Brothers unit, which trades metals, agricultural
products and other commodities. In the coming months,
Philipp's staff is likely to be slashed, inventories reduced
and operations further restructured, Salomon executives said,
with a view toward possibly folding or selling the unit.
   Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund was in Tokyo on business
and couldn't be reached for comment, and a Salomon spokesman
declined to comment.
   Salomon executives said specifics haven't been worked out.
But at the very least, they want to stop the bleeding at
Philipp Brothers; if the unit trades less, the hope is, it
will have smaller losses.
   Whatever happens, the experience underscores the risks
Wall Street firms face in operating businesses far from
traditional securities lines.
   The losses are particularly ironic for Salomon. First,
Salomon is known as one of the best trading firms. Second,
the Philipp Brothers commodities unit initially was part of
Phibro Corp., which acquired Salomon Brothers in 1981.
   Salomon's Phibro Energy unit was a major driver in
Salomon's earnings last year, partly because of volatile oil
prices and widening profit margins in oil refining.
   Philipp Brothers has cut back sharply from the
approximately 150 commodities it traded at the time of the
Phibro-Salomon merger to only a handful now; in previous
restructurings, Salomon sold Philipp Brothers' pig-iron plant
operations and a steel products distributor. Head count has
already been slashed: As of March 31, Philipp Brothers had
689 employees, down from 703 at year end and 744 at the end
of 1988, analysts said. The unit's assets shrank to $1.6
billion at the end of 1989 from $2.3 billion a year earlier.
   Until now, some Salomon executives had believed that if
commodity prices would follow a sustained trend, rather than
trading in a narrow range as they are now, Philipp Brothers
could earn as much as $50 million a year before taxes. And
they noted that most of the Philipp Brothers' losses are on
paper; that is, they represent open trading positions that
have been marked to market and haven't been closed out.
Theoretically, the unit's fortunes could turn around and many
of the paper losses be reversed. But this isn't likely,
analysts said, unless there is a sustained bull market in
commodities prices.
   Last year, Philipp Brothers took big hits in cocoa
trading. It blamed the 1990 first-quarter loss on unspecified
trades in nonferrous metals, a group that includes copper,
aluminum, nickel, tin and zinc. In the second quarter, the
culprit was trading in agricultural commodities.
   Still, the choice of what to do with Philipp Brothers
isn't easy. Leaving the commodities business would be
expensive, Salomon executives said, primarily because of the
need to liquidate positions and realize losses. And while
selling Philipp Brothers has been talked about, the big
unanswered question is to whom.
   One benefit of folding Philipp Brothers into either Phibro
or Salomon Brothers Inc., the big securities subsidiary,
would be that Salomon Inc. could hide Philipp's recent bleak
results, some analysts said.
   "At some point, this segment could be rolled up into
either Phibro's or Salomon Brothers' operations or divested,"
a Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst, Dean Eberling, said
in a recent report. "Some pieces of the business could
remain, while a major portion gets sold or discontinued."
   What has particularly hurt Salomon is that Philipp
Brothers' results have tarred what otherwise have been
impressive earnings in the firm's securities and energy
segments. Despite the second-quarter bloodbath at Philipp
Brothers, for example, Salomon's net income was $120 million.
   Philipp's losses are throwing a wrench into analysts'
expectations. When anticipating Salomon Inc.'s earnings,
Wertheim Schroder's Mr. Hanbury said he now routinely plugs
in losses of as much as $35 million a quarter for Philipp
Brothers, compared with $10 million to $15 million in the
past. "I work my estimates from there," he said.

   THE LEGEND OF THE GREAT missionary doctor Albert
Schweitzer lives on among a handful of U.S. surgeons who
spend time away from lucrative practices to bring modern
medicine to the Third World.
   Calling their activities "Operation Smile," these doctors
volunteer their special skills to bring, quite literally,
smiles to the faces of their patients. Typical is Leonard
Sharzer, a 47-year-old plastic surgeon with a successful
Manhattan practice.
   Dr. Sharzer routinely devotes a few hours each month to
providing free facial surgery for the indigent at a Bronx
hospital. But in October he led 35 other medical volunteers
to Kenya, where for three weeks he personally operated on 40
children, mostly to correct harelips and cleft palates. These
at-birth deformities, crevices in the lip or the roof of the
mouth, impede speech. They are routinely mended in the U.S.
before an infant is three months old; in poorer countries,
however, the congenital defects often remain untreated and
the afflicted may become social outcasts.
   Dr. Sharzer first heard about Operation Smile last year
from a fellow physician, William Magee, at a medical-school
reunion. Dr. Magee, a plastic surgeon who spends 20 hours a
week on Smile despite a busy practice in Norfolk, Va., and
his wife, Kathy, who is a nurse, founded the nonprofit
organization in 1982. The Magees did so after participating
in a 1981 trip to the Philippines at the invitation of a
province there to operate on patients and teach local doctors
surgical techniques. The couple came away feeling overwhelmed
by the number of people needing their skills.
   Smile teams have returned annually to the Philippines
since 1982. Other countries added since include Kenya,
Liberia and, last year, Vietnam. So far this year there have
been five missions; two more, to Kenya and Ghana, are
scheduled.
   A total of about 4,000 operations have been done by the
teams since 1982. In addition to repairing harelips and cleft
palates, the teams remove tumors and rebuild limbs or facial
features deformed at birth or disfigured by disease or
accidents. "The goal is to restore human dignity," says Dr.
Magee. Operation Smile also brings some foreign patients to
the U.S. and provides free operations for needy U.S.
patients.
   Operation Smile raises the $1.5 million it spends annually
from private donations and from 2,500 youths at 12 high
school and college "Happy Clubs," which raise funds through
car washes and benefit dances. It also has 11 chapters that
raise funds through special benefits. Three of these chapters
-- in Washington, New York and Cincinnati -- raise their own
separate funds for their trips. For example, Gerard Byrne,
publisher of Variety magazine and a prep school classmate of
Dr. Magee, is among the leaders of New York's current drive
to raise funds for a Smile mission to Vietnam in February.
   Costs average about $100,000 a mission, excluding supplies
contributed by such companies as Johnson &amp; Johnson and
reduced fares and free cargo space offered by Northwest
Airlines. Team members, who use vacation time to make the
trips, each contribute $250 toward their travel expenses. The
value of their professional time on each trip -- some 50
surgeons participate regularly -- is an estimated $5,000 to
$10,000 per doctor.
   The pay: the smiles from their patients.

   House Approves
   Housing Bill
   That Faces Veto

   WASHINGTON -- The House, ignoring a veto threat, approved
an omnibus housing bill that would significantly increase
federal spending for public housing programs.
   The bill, which passed on a 378-43 vote, would allocate
$28 billion for housing programs for fiscal 1991, $10 billion
more than the Senate approved last month in its bill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The White House said yesterday that President Bush would
veto the legislation in its current form because it is too
costly and doesn't address the administration's concerns over
the health of the Federal Housing Administration.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp argued
that the House measure doesn't require adequate up-front
insurance premiums for first-time home buyers and that it
fails to provide sufficient capital requirements for the FHA.
   Under the House bill, $19.4 billion would be allocated for
existing nonrural housing programs and $2.1 billion for
modernization. The bill also provides $500 million for a new
program to subsidize interest rates so first-time home buyers
would pay a maximum interest rate of 6%.
   In addition, the bill would provide $310 million for a new
program to assist public housing residents in buying their
government-owned homes, a provision also included in the
Senate bill. The House bill also would authorize $300 million
for the construction of new rental housing, a provision
opposed by the administration.
   Another provision of the House bill that differs
significantly from the Senate version is the restructuring of
the FHA loan program. An amendment introduced by Rep. Bruce
Vento (D., Minn.) and Rep. Thomas Ridge (R., Pa.) would phase
out over five years the 3.8% up-front insurance premium,
requiring instead that a payment of 1.35% of the value of the
mortgage be paid at the time of the settlement and that 0.6%
be paid over the life of the loan. The Senate measure retains
the current 3.8% up-front insurance requirement. The Senate
bill also requires that two-thirds of the closing costs be
paid up front, a provision not required by the House bill.
   In a letter to Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman
of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs,
Mr. Kemp wrote: "Should a bill containing the Vento-Ridge
amendment or a similarly unacceptable proposal reach the
president's desk, I and the president's other senior advisers
would recommend that it be vetoed."
   But Mary Brunette, an assistant to Secretary Kemp, said
the administration was hopeful that a compromise could be
reached in the conference committee. "The administration
would be willing to accept higher spending if the conference
report more closely resembles the Senate bill," she said.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Isuzu to End Its Popular Campaign

   LOS ANGELES -- Joe Isuzu's days are numbered. And that's
no lie.
   A new ad campaign from American Isuzu Motors, the first in
four years not to feature its lying "Joe Isuzu" pitchman,
will begin airing Aug. 13. The new spots? Get ready for campy
ads starring lizards, bees and alligators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Venturing out without Joe, a likeable but smarmy guy who
distorted the benefits of Isuzu cars and trucks, is a risky
move. The character, played by comic actor David Leisure,
established little-known Isuzu in the minds of American car
buyers. The humorous, clever commercials routinely topped
consumer polls of favorite ad campaigns.
   But in an interview at Della Femina McNamee's office here,
where Isuzu's ads are cooked up, executives involved in the
launch of the new campaign described why Joe got the ax:
Isuzu cars -- unlike Isuzu trucks -- don't sell well, and
Joe's getting the blame.
   "It was our judgment that Joe doesn't do as good a job
selling passenger cars as he does with trucks," said Fritz
Kern, senior vice president at American Isuzu, the U.S. arm
of Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan. Isuzu's sporty Impulse car,
for example, "is a pretty serious car. It's in a highly
competitive segment and the people who are interested in it
see a dichotomy between the Joe Isuzu character and that kind
of product."
   Isuzu this month will introduce three new models, two of
which are passenger cars. "The product line transition that
we're going through right now is probably the biggest impetus
to our giving serious consideration to an alternative
campaign," Mr. Kern said. All of the new ads feature a young
guy who acts as on-camera spokesman -- but unlike Joe Isuzu,
the spokesman is nameless and isn't the focus of the ads.
   One ad, perhaps the most clever of the new spots, pits an
Isuzu pickup against a Toyota pickup in an end-of-the-world
minidrama. "If Earth were invaded by giant reptiles, which
would be better prepared?" asks the spokesman. The two trucks
are shown parked on a busy city street as giant lizards,
towering above skyscrapers, emerge from the side streets.
It's all done in kitschy B-movie style: Young executives
scream and run for cover. Fires break out. A policeman yells
"Get out of here]"
   The spokesman continues: "Well, first of all, the Isuzu
gets better mileage than Toyota." The Toyota, speeding down
the street away from a giant lizard, comes to a screeching
halt as the camera focuses on its "empty" gas gauge. "That's
helpful," the guy says, as an ugly reptile crushes that
truck. The Isuzu, of course, drives away, escaping the
lizards.
   Another new spot, this one for Isuzu's new Rodeo,
demonstrates the key advantage of the sports utility truck,
the fact that it seats six, over Toyota's 4Runner, which
seats only five. Here, the narrator demonstrates the
advantage by releasing a box of ticked-off bees near two
families of six. One family climbs into the Rodeo and drives
off. One member of the other family, though, can't fit into
the 4Runner and instead dives into a pond to escape the bees.
   Some marketing specialists say dropping Joe is a mistake.
They charge that Isuzu simply has tired of the campaign, but
say consumers haven't. "The lizard spot would be a perfect
commercial for Joe to star in," said David Vadehra, president
of Video Storyboard Tests Inc., an ad-tracking firm whose
annual surveys routinely ranked Isuzu's campaigns in the top
10.
   "I don't think they should be chucking the whole concept,"
Mr. Vadehra said. "They have spent four years establishing
him. If he's doing a good job selling trucks, why not keep
him?" Mr. Vadehra and others said the character might
continue effectively even in ads for Isuzu cars, but in
perhaps a more supporting role, deferring to the cars as
star.
   "To get through the clutter of auto advertising is a
horrendous challenge. These people did it brilliantly," said
Clive Chajet, chairman and chief executive officer at
Lippincott &amp; Margulies Inc., a New York identity and image
consultant. "I'm surprised that they are walking away from
all that equity."
   But Peter Stranger, president of Della Femina's office
here, insisted the decision to drop Joe wasn't made lightly.
"There was no grand scheme to assassinate Joe Isuzu," he
said. "Every year we assessed how successful he was being.
You don't want to stay too long and you don't want to get out
too early. The bigger mistake would be to stay too long."
   Mr. Stranger said four different campaigns were tested to
find the best campaign to replace Joe Isuzu. He said
executives at the agency entertained the idea of keeping Joe
just for truck ads but later decided that wouldn't work.
"This year we had very good alternatives," he said.
   The driving force behind the switch is Isuzu's desire to
become a major player in the U.S. passenger car market and,
in particular, to become a stronger competitor to Toyota.
   Sales of Isuzu cars have been disappointing. In the first
six months of the year, sales of Isuzu import cars plummeted
81% to just 1,810 units, though Isuzu says the drop occurred
because expected new-model shipments didn't arrive at
showrooms as scheduled. Truck sales, however, jumped 27% to
56,690 units in the first half of the year.
   "Passenger cars have never represented a very high share
of our sales volume," Isuzu's Mr. Kern said. The company has
high hopes that its new passenger cars -- including its
Stylus and remodeled Impulse -- will be the answer to the car
sales dilemma.
   As for the new campaign, both Mr. Kern and Mr. Stranger
are confident they are making the right move. "We're moving
on, but we're not turning around 180 degrees," Mr. Kern said.
He added, though, that the company is "reserving the right"
to bring Joe Isuzu back -- while denying flatly that Isuzu
dumped the campaign because of extraordinary salary demands
by Mr. Leisure, the actor, as had been rumored.
   "I got a personal, handwritten letter from him thanking us
for this long association," Mr. Kern said. "He realized that
most campaigns don't last four years. His life changed -- all
for the better -- and so did ours."

   Gloomy economic tidings sent investors shopping for bonds,
gold and utility stocks.
   But fears of weakening corporate profits helped depress
the Dow Jones Industrial Average 5.94 points to 2899.26.
Several broader market indexes also fell slightly.

   In the foreign-exchange market, the dollar pulled out of
its recent tailspin, climbing sharply against the mark. The
dollar also rose against the British pound but managed only a
small gain against the Japanese yen. Several traders predict
the dollar will resume declining because they expect interest
rates to climb overseas and to ease in the U.S.
   Speculation about lower U.S. rates intensified early
yesterday after the National Association of Purchasing
Management's report for July showed more economic weakness
than analysts had expected. That report "heightened prospects
for lower interest rates" but also "depressed expectations
for corporate profits," said A.C. Moore, research director at
Argus Research Corp.
   "All year, this market has been a tug of war between
disappointing earnings, which are bad for stocks, and
declining interest rates, which are good for stocks," said
Byron Wien, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "Right
now, the focus of the market is more on earnings than it is
on rates."
   Treasury bond prices advanced more than 5/8 point, or
about $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount, even as the
government disclosed plans to sell a record $32.25 billion of
new notes and bonds next week. The timing of the auctions
depends on when Congress raises the nation's debt ceiling.
   While stock prices generally slumped, utility stocks
continued to attract investors because utilities are big
borrowers and especially sensitive to interest rate changes.
The Dow Jones Utilities Average rose 2.89 points yesterday to
212.90, which many traders interpret as signaling lower
interest rates ahead.
   Gold prices have rebounded recently after a deep slump
earlier this year. Traders attribute the turnaround partly to
Middle East tensions, the dollar's recent weakness, and the
U.S. economy's growing sluggishness. Some analysts also cite
growing prospects for another credit-easing move by the
Federal Reserve.
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Declining issues outnumbered advancers
by 777 to 733 on the New York Stock Exchange.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell to 8.35% from 8.41%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rebounded. In late New York trading yesterday,
the dollar was quoted at 147.18 yen, up from 145.80 yen late
Tuesday, and at 1.5885 marks, up from 1.5869 marks.

   Under the Same Roof

   AN AUSTIN, Texas, law firm is offering divorce clients an
unusual fringe benefit: free group therapy sessions conducted
right in its office.
   Boozer &amp; Tull says the weekly meetings are designed to
focus attention on the anger and frustration that spouses
often bring to divorce cases. "We fix their legal problems,
but they go out the door worse off emotionally than they came
in," says Jennifer Tull, a lawyer with the firm.
   Many law firms have working arrangements with
psychiatrists and psychologists, but in-house therapy
sessions are unusual. The voluntary meetings are conducted by
Larry Bugen, an Austin psychologist paid by Boozer &amp; Tull on
a per-meeting basis.
   The therapy could also aid lawyers -- by reducing the
threat of malpractice suits. "If clients are working out
their anger with a group, maybe they won't turn it on me,"
says Ms. Tull.
   So far, one client group has gone through the eight-week
course of sessions, and Ms. Tull says the feedback is
positive. But Donn C. Fullenweider, president of the American
Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, is skeptical. The Houston
lawyer thinks psychiatry and law should be kept separate
because they have different goals and sometimes end up
providing conflicting advice. "When one overlaps the other,"
he says, "you're bound to have problems."
                                                                                                       

   Testing the Limits
   Of Lawyers' Ads
                                                                                                       

   THE DEBATE over lawyers marketing their services on
television gets more fuel from a nationwide "advertising
cooperative."
   The Personal Injury Trial Lawyers Association, based in
New Orleans, solicits lawyers to buy memberships in the
organization. In return, PITLA finances local, regional and
national television commercials promoting the use of member
lawyers. Members pay a monthly fee of $500 to $700, plus a
pro-rated share of the cost of producing the TV ads.
   The commercials instruct potential claimants to call a
toll-free number. Staffers refer the callers to lawyers on a
rotating basis. Founded in 1986 by marketing executive G.
Lenn Brown, PITLA claims a 1990 TV ad budget of about $36
million, up $20 million from 1989. Its commercials, produced
by a New Orleans ad agency also founded by Mr. Brown, now run
in 230 cities in 49 states, he says.
   The association doesn't advertise in Iowa because of the
state's tough advertising restrictions, Mr. Brown says. Carl
V. Nielsen, executive director of the Iowa Bar Association,
says lawyer advertising is permitted, but the bar doesn't
allow dramatizations, "And the people who do commercials
don't like that." PITLA ads sometimes use actors.
   In March, Tennessee regulators blocked the association's
commercials, charging that the group is an unauthorized
lawyer referral service. The association sued, alleging
restraint of trade and First Amendment violations. The two
sides subsequently agreed the organization could air its
commercials while they try to work out a formal settlement.
   The American Bar Association isn't taking a position on
the group, but it hears from skeptical lawyers each time
PITLA enters a new market. "I can almost gauge {their}
marketing efforts by the calls I get," says William Hornsby
of the ABA Commission on advertising.
                                                                                                       

   More Companies Bitten
   By `Cobra' Lawsuits
                                                                                                       

   COMPANIES ARE facing more suits under a federal law
requiring companies to offer group health coverage to former
employees.
   Enacted in 1986, a section of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act, nicknamed Cobra, requires most
employers to let workers extend their health insurance for at
least 18 months after they have been terminated or have
voluntarily left their jobs.
   But workers say some employers are not complying with the
law, and their complaints are beginning to reach the courts.
In the past year, the Labor Department sued Eastern Airlines
and Dayton Hudson, charging that they denied Cobra benefits
to employees. Both firms made concessions in settling the
cases without denying or admitting the allegations. Private
suits are pending in Texas, Florida and South Carolina.
   Lawyers say some companies inadvertently fail to notify
employees of their Cobra rights because the law is complex
and relatively new. But other companies resist extending the
benefits because they fear it will drive up health-care
premiums.
   The "big issue," says a Labor Department spokeswoman, is
whether an employee was properly informed of the right to
purchase extended coverage. Cobra requires employers to give
written notice of that right. Another disputed issue is when
an employee is considered to have been fired for "gross
misconduct." Such employees are exempt from Cobra benefits.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   NEW MEXICO'S bar association has formed a committee to
combat the image of lawyers as greedy and unethical. It isn't
easy. "The more you say, `I'm not a crook,' the more people
say you are," says committee member Randi McGinn of
Albuquerque. . . . A federal court in Lubbock, Texas, is
pondering whether cowspeak is a protected trademark. Yet
Inc., a restaurant operator, is trying to guard the "Mooo"
slogan it uses on "Mooonues," from which patrons order Mooo
meals. Yet Inc. sued the Western Sizzlin restaurant chain of
Dallas, charging that it misappropriated the trademark with
its own too-similar slogan: "Moo."

   Kodak Reports
   2nd-Period Net
   Surged Fivefold

   Results Helped by Program
   To Trim Costs, Impact
   Of Charge in '89 Quarter

   Eastman Kodak Co., benefiting sooner than expected from a
cost-savings program, reported second-quarter profit jumped
nearly fivefold after a big year-earlier charge.
   The earnings surge surprised some analysts, who increased
their full-year projections, and helped boost Kodak's
long-languishing stock. Analysts had criticized the company's
cost-cutting program as too little and too late. While
somewhat chastened, they question whether Kodak's moves into
pharmaceuticals and electronic imaging will pay off.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Net was $384 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with $77
million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Last year's
second quarter, however, included a $227 million
restructuring charge and was restated to reflect a 12-month
calendar year that went into effect in January, compared with
a 13-month period in 1989.
   Excluding the restructuring charge, net increased 26%.
Sales increased 2% to $4.87 billion from $4.77 billion.
   The increase in earnings exceeded both the company's
internal projections and analysts' forecasts. Analysts said
the benefits of the restructuring launched last year, which
included eliminating about 7,500 jobs, or about 5% of Kodak's
world-wide work force, kicked in at least a quarter earlier
than the company had expected.
   On that news, Kodak shares surged $4.25 apiece to close at
$42.375 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. Volume
was very heavy, with 3.9 million shares changing hands.
   B. Alex Henderson, of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
increased his rating on the stock to a buy from a hold, and
said he expects the company to earn more than $4 a share this
year, up from his previous estimate of $3.70 a share. Brenda
Lee Landry, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., also boosted
her full year estimate to $3.95 a share from $3.75.
   The Rochester, N.Y., photographic, pharmaceutical and
chemical concern said it expects continued improvement in its
earnings and "a strong second-half performance," but didn't
make a specific earnings projection.
   "The criticism of Kodak will die down for a while because
now things seem to be turning around," said Eugene Glazer, an
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, who has been recommending
the stock. But he says a key question is whether Kodak can
increase revenue in businesses such as pharmaceuticals and
electronic imaging while paring mature businesses.
   Mr. Glazer said increasing earnings through cost-cutting
probably won't increase Kodak's stock price over the longer
term because investors will expect to see improving results
from the company's new investments. "If top-line growth
doesn't come, then you'll see a resurfacing of concerns."
   Following last year's second quarter, when company profit
plunged 85%, the company embarked on a new round of
cost-cutting -- the fourth in six years. At the time, the
company said it would eliminate thousands of jobs and dispose
of or restructure 20 businesses with $1.25 billion in annual
sales. The program was designed to generate $1 billion in
operating savings in 1990.
   Previously Kodak came under fire because restructuring
efforts failed to boost earnings. In 1984, the company
restructured into smaller divisions to make them more
efficient. That wasn't enough, however, to avoid a 10%
work-force reduction and a 5% budget cut in 1986. And only
months before last year's second-quarter restructuring, the
company said it would slash costs for support services by 15%
by 1990.
   Since that time, Kodak has sold a number of businesses,
including its Verbatim unit, which made floppy disks, and
joint ventures. Looking forward, the company doesn't intend
to undertake any restructurings as bold as those initiated
last year, a company spokesman said.
   In the latest quarter, the company's film and paper
products had particularly strong showings, analysts said.
While operating profits at the company's chemical business
were off, analysts said they didn't fall as much as expected.
   Prudential-Bache's Mr. Henderson said profit margins at
the company's imaging segment "were way ahead of target." He
said that was the result of a reduced work force, modest
price increases, benefits from foreign currency translations
and improved productivity.
   For the six months, profit more than doubled to $583
million, or $1.80 a share, from restated net of $289 million,
or 89 cents a share a year earlier. Sales were roughly flat
at $8.98 billion.

   Environment:
   Big Mac Joins
   With Big Critic
   To Cut Trash

   McDonald's Corp., a frequent target of environmentalists,
has agreed to work with the Environmental Defense Fund to
reduce the tons of trash generated daily by the fast-food
chain's more than 11,000 restaurants world-wide.
   A task force of four officials each from the environmental
group and McDonald's will spend six months considering such
options as greater use of recycled material -- napkins and
Happy Meal boxes already are made of recycled paper -- as
well as the reduction of packaging and the use of reusable
utensils and cups.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The aim is to reduce the chain's trash and set a standard
for others. "If McDonalds's can do innovative things to
redesign and reduce packaging materials, that will in itself
make a dent in the nation's solid waste problem and also
serve as an example to others," says Frederic Krupp, the
EDF's executive director.
   For McDonald's, getting the EDF's blessing could help mute
critics who regard it as a symbol of the disposable society.
McDonald's sells, and packages, hamburgers and other food for
22 million customers a day.
   The compact poses risks for both sides. Shelby Yastrow,
senior vice president and director of environmental affairs
for McDonald's, concedes that if the task force is unable to
agree on some issues, "that could be an embarrassment, if it
isn't handled right." At least for now, McDonald's, based in
Oak Brook, Ill., plans to continue to use polystyrene
plastic, a practice that has sparked efforts in some
communities to ban McDonald's packaging.
   Burger King says it has no plans to counter McDonald's
action. "We believe we have a great advantage," a spokeswoman
says, because the Grand Metropolitan PLC fast-food chain uses
only paper in its packaging, except for coffee cups.
   The Environmental Defense Fund risks criticism from fellow
environmentalists. "If we're unable to accomplish something,
I suppose some people will say `I told you so. You should
stick to litigation,'" Mr. Krupp says. But he insists: "There
are moments when it makes sense to see what mutual interest
we have with corporations." The environmental group won't be
paid for its efforts.
   Ralph Nader wasn't impressed. "Grass-roots environmental
groups aren't convinced that McDonald's is serious about
creating a better environment," he said.
   Mr. Yastrow says an early project for the task force might
be to examine the environmental consequences of a change
McDonald's is considering making in how it wraps a specific
product, which he wouldn't identify. The task force also will
be looking to see if McDonald's can make greater use of
material, such as unbleached paper, whose production and
disposal do less damage to the environment than materials
McDonald's currently uses. In addition, the group will look
at using McDonald's popular consumer appeal to promote
recycling generally. It also will examine using food wastes
and packaging for composting.
   The effort grew partly out of opposition to McDonald's
testing of on-site incineration of its waste at some outlets.
After being approached by EDF last year, McDonald's agreed to
abandon the project.
   Mr. Yastrow says he became interested in working with EDF
after appearing on a TV program last year with Mr. Krupp, who
had already contacted the company about working on the waste
issue. Even before then, however, the company had taken a
number of steps to reduce its contribution to the nation's
trash heap. In Brooklyn, N.Y., it collects used packaging
from schools and cafeterias as part of a recycling project.
Coca-Cola is now pumped from trucks into McDonald's tanks,
rather than being placed in interim packaging.
   Under the agreement signed yesterday, each side is free to
disagree with the recommendations of the task force or
interpret them differently. McDonald's can put all or some of
them them into place as it chooses. Either side can abandon
the project at any time if there proves to be little ground
for agreement.

   WASHINGTON -- Washington Bancorp., hurt by real estate
loans that turned sour, said it filed for protection from its
creditors under federal bankruptcy law.
   The company is the parent of National Bank of Washington
and other small banking units, though they weren't included
in the filing, made under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code. The parent said in a statement that it
expects its stockholders "will be unable to realize value for
their interest in the company."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The statement added that the company's creditors "will
likely receive less than the face value" of their securities.
   Washington Bancorp. said it is still reviewing its
options, including liquidation or reorganization of its
assets. Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate but
has court protection against creditors' lawsuits while it
tries to work out a plan for paying its debts. The company
added that its filing, which couldn't be obtained last
evening, listed known liabilities of about $61.7 million and
assets of an "undetermined" market value.
   Company officers, who weren't available for comment, were
said to be still meeting yesterday evening with federal
regulators.
   Washington Bancorp. isn't related to Washington Bancorp
Inc., based in Hoboken, N.J.
   The troubles of Washington Bancorp. reflect both a
downturn in the real estate market and a more general
economic slowdown in the Washington area. The company said
last month that it mightn't be able to continue operating,
after posting a second-quarter loss of $80 million, or $11.28
a share. The loss knocked the capital of National Bank of
Washington, the District of Columbia's fourth-largest bank,
below federal standards.
   The parent company said at the end of the second quarter
that its assets were $1.8 billion.
   Other banking companies in the region have encountered
troubles, too. Perpetual Financial Corp. -- the Vienna, Va.,
parent of Perpetual Savings Bank, the area's largest thrift
-- had a $50.2 million loss in its second quarter ended April
30. MNC Financial Inc., the Baltimore-based holding company
for some of the area's largest commercial banks, has had its
debt classified as below investment grade, or "junk."
   Stockholders of Washington Bancorp. have already seen the
value of their shares plummet from a high this year of $18.50
each. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, the
shares fell 12.5 cents each to close at $1, lowering the
total market value of Washington Bancorp. to $7.1 million.
   Among the creditors at risk are holders of the company's
commercial paper. The principal amount of that debt is $35.2
million.
   Washington Bancorp. had said earlier this month that its
ability to continue as a going concern would be in doubt
unless it could put into effect a plan to restore its
capital, restructure its nonperforming assets, and reach an
accommodation with creditors.
   Contributing to the large second-quarter loss was a $61
million addition to loan-loss reserves, which was made after
company officials and regulators did a review of the
company's assets. The company also took charges of $15
million on asset sales and write-downs in the latest quarter.
   The problem with the bank's loan portfolio "further
illustrates the problems in real estate" in the
Washington-Baltimore region, said Elizabeth Hayes, an analyst
with Johnston Lemon in Washington.
   About 52% of the bank's loan portfolio is in real estate
loans, mostly covering residential and commercial properties.
At the end of the second quarter, the bank had $156 million
in nonperforming loans, of which 66% were real estate loans.
Analysts also noted that the bank was a major lender to
several Washington-area real estate developers, who have
recently filed under the bankruptcy laws themselves.
   A cash squeeze at the holding company came about in early
May, when a group of banks pulled a line of credit that had
backed the commercial paper Washington Bancorp. had issued to
support its mortgage unit. Without the credit line, the
company wasn't able to issue any more commercial paper.
   Also in May, the company named John J. Mason chairman and
chief executive officer and gave preliminary approval to a
plan to refinance its debt by issuing $45 million in new
secured notes. Mr. Mason, formerly chairman of NS&amp;T
Bankshares Inc., Washington, was to be one of the investors
in the new debt issue. But the plan fell through as the
company's condition deteriorated.
   Washington Bancorp. noted that National Bank of Washington
and its other banking units, Washington Bank (Va.) and
Washington Bank (Md.), remain open for business, and that
their deposits continue to be insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. for as much as $100,000 for each customer
account.

   Top CBOT Post
   Amid Stotler Woes

   CHICAGO -- Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, the embattled chairman
of the Chicago Board of Trade, resigned suddenly from his
post as the top officer of the nation's largest futures
exchange.
   The proud manager, who reveled in the traditions of the
country's oldest futures exchange and the influence it
commanded, broke a venerable CBOT tradition by stepping down.
He is the first Board of Trade chairman to resign in 130
years, the exchange said. The Board of Trade was formed in
1848.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The exchange's directors said that Vice Chairman William
F. O'Connor was elected to serve as chairman for the
remainder of Mr. Mahlmann's fourth one-year term.
   Mr. Mahlmann's resignation yesterday afternoon followed
weeks of mounting criticism leveled at the 52-year-old
executive for his role as chairman of financially crippled
Stotler Group Inc., which has futures brokerage and funds
management subsidiaries. Stotler Group's troubles and those
of its units have tarnished the reputation of the Board of
Trade at a time of increased congressional concern about lax
regulation in the futures industry, exchange members said.
   Mr. Mahlmann's nickname, earned more than 30 years ago
when the young German immigrant started out trading grain in
the physical or "cash," as opposed to futures, market, has
taken on an ironic aspect in recent weeks. Stotler Group has
been driven to the brink of insolvency by the inability of it
and its main futures brokerage unit to raise enough cash to
meet industry capital requirements.
   Perhaps the most serious blow yet to a Stotler unit was
delivered Tuesday by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. The federal regulator charged the company's
Stotler Funds Inc. subsidiary with fraudulently misusing $5.5
million in customer money invested in two futures funds it
managed. Until then, the cash-strapped Stotler companies had
been able to say that no customer funds had been imperiled by
their difficulties.
   Neither Mr. Mahlmann nor any other individual was named in
the CFTC charges.
   Mr. Mahlmann couldn't be reached for comment on his
resignation or the events leading up to it.
   Yesterday morning Mr. Mahlmann resigned from his role as
chairman of Stotler Group and its failed futures brokerage
unit, Stotler &amp; Co. But in a letter distributed to exchange
members he said he was determined to serve out the remainder
of his term.
   On Tuesday the exchange's board, after telling members in
a letter that the exchange had acted properly in its
oversight of Stotler, said they unanimously supported Mr.
Mahlmann as chairman of the exchange. Some members said
privately that the directors should have waited until more
facts were known about Stotler's troubles before lining up
behind the chairman.
   By yesterday afternoon, Mr. Mahlmann appeared to realize
that the events surrounding the Stotler parent company and
its subsidiaries had overtaken him, and he wouldn't be able
to effectively lead the Board of Trade, an exchange director
said.
   Mr. Mahlmann told the directors that his resignation was
"in the overwhelming interest of the Board of Trade,"
according to an exchange news release.
   The fallout from the Stotler companies' troubles is likely
to haunt Mr. Mahlmann for months. Regulators are almost
certain to take disciplinary action of some sort against
Stotler Group, its subsidiaries or both. Company officers
could also be named. Civil lawsuits from disgruntled
investors in Stotler Group or in the funds managed by Stotler
Funds also are likely, regulators say.
   Futures regulators say the case may also be referred to
the local U.S. attorney's office for possible criminal
prosecution.
   Mr. Mahlmann has gone to great lengths in recent days to
emphasize that he hasn't been involved in the day-to-day
management of any of the Stotler companies for more than two
years. He began spending nearly all his time on exchange
affairs by early 1988, and agreed to relinquish his position
as managing partner of the Stotler partnership that was
reorganized as Stotler Group when the company went public in
August 1988.
   Since mid-1989 Mr. Mahlmann hasn't received a salary from
Stotler. The Board of Trade made the chairmanship a paying
position in 1989 with an annual salary of $250,000.
   Stotler's troubles were publicly hinted at July 12, when
Stotler Group asked that its stock not open for trading on
the American Stock Exchange because of "news pending." Three
days later the company, confirming widespread industry
rumors, said its Stotler &amp; Co. futures brokerage unit
couldn't meet CBOT minimum capital requirements.
   The company fell out of compliance with capital rules when
a nearly $13 million inter-company funds transfer between it
and the parent Stotler Group was disallowed by the CFTC.
Futures industry regulations require that brokerage firms
maintain a cash cushion equal to 4% of segregated customer
funds.
   Less than two weeks later Stotler &amp; Co. was forced out of
the brokerage business for lack of capital.
   Stotler Group last week defaulted on $750,000 in
commercial paper payments and said it may not be able to make
$7.6 million in debt payments due within 30 days.

   Contrary to your July 23 editorial "Singapore Scheme," the
Singapore government does not need the APEC {Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation group} conference to "legitimize" its
policy on foreign publications. It is Dow Jones that is
trying to use the conference and the presence of foreign
government ministers to pressure Singapore into lifting the
restrictions on The Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far
Eastern Economic Review.
   Our policy on foreign publications is a well-known and
longstanding one: Their circulation in Singapore is a
privilege, and not a right; they should not interfere in
Singapore's domestic politics; and they should be subject to
the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. Karen Elliott
House, vice president/international of Dow Jones &amp; Co., told
Goh Chok Tong {first deputy prime minister of Singapore} in
Washington, D.C., in April 1990, that Dow Jones had no
difficulty with these conditions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It follows from this policy that foreign correspondents
have no right to be stationed in Singapore. That an APEC
meeting is taking place does not entitle AWSJ and FEER
correspondents to enter Singapore. The government sees no
reason to grant this privilege to AWSJ and FEER, because they
have repeatedly engaged in domestic politics and taken on the
government. Ms. House acknowledged in a letter to Mr. Goh
that "our activities in Singapore are at the sufferance of
Singapore's constitution, laws and regulations."
   More than 170 correspondents from international news
agencies and major foreign and regional newspapers and
magazines will be covering the APEC conference. They include
correspondents from AP-Dow Jones News Service and The Wall
Street Journal. Excluding FEER and AWSJ correspondents will
not in any way impair news coverage of any event in
Singapore, including the APEC conference.
   The government restricted AWSJ's circulation for refusing
to publish official replies to a hostile article. AWSJ
challenged this in the Singapore High Court. The court ruled
against the AWSJ. Ms. House wrote to Mr. Goh that "we
recognize that Singapore's courts have held that The Asian
Wall Street Journal in 1986 engaged in the domestic politics
of Singapore. We have no further rights of appeal from that
decision; it is final, and we accept it as such." Why is AWSJ
still complaining?
   As for the prime minister's libel suits brought against
FEER and AWSJ, if the courts find them unfounded, they will
dismiss them with costs against the prime minister. One case
has been decided against FEER. FEER has appealed, and the
Court of Appeal will decide. But when the judgment was
delivered, Dow Jones issued a statement suggesting that the
court was unfairly in favor of the prime minister. This
statement became the cause of the further actions.
   We have never maintained that it was not open to Dow
Jones's lawyers to raise arguments in Singapore courtrooms,
claiming rights that amount to participating in domestic
politics as if their clients were Singapore citizens. It is
fully within the law for them to make these claims in their
defense of the action. Whether such claims are sustainable
will be decided by the courts. The question is: Do the
lawyers' claims represent Dow Jones's official position? If
they do, then what was the worth of Ms. House's assurances to
Mr. Goh, that "it is never our intent . . . to engage in
domestic politics"?
   The editorial itself clearly shows Dow Jones's intent to
interfere. It criticizes the government for being "embroiled
not only with its natural political opponents, but also with
longtime associates," because it "engaged in a tiff with the
Catholic Church and exchanged unpleasantries with the Privy
Council," and for "heavy-handed efforts to stifle local
dissent and criticism." These are all internal actions and
policies. Foreign publications can report on them, but they
have no business taking sides for or against them.
   If Dow Jones does not seek to interfere in Singapore
politics, why did it take advertising space in a Singapore
newspaper on July 30 to print in full this editorial,
attacking the Singapore government?
   Until Dow Jones understands that its promise not to engage
in Singapore's domestic politics means not taking sides for
or against the government on Singapore's internal actions and
policies, the restrictions on AWSJ, FEER and their
correspondents will stay.

   XIAMEN, China -- Not long ago, when mainland Chinese
wanted to see their capitalist brethren in Taiwan, they had
to climb a steep hill in Xiamen and, for about 20 cents a
minute, peer through a powerful telescope trained on the
enemy-held territory across the strait.
   Today it's easier. Here in Xiamen, and all across China's
Fujian province, the Taiwanese have landed. Taking advantage
of relaxed attitudes at home and China's desperate need for
investment and foreign exchange, several hundred thousand
people from Taiwan have stormed the mainland, crossing the
Taiwan Strait to tour, visit relatives and, most importantly,
invest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Leading the stampede are people like Liu Yuen-chi, a
Taiwan-born business manager of one of Xiamen's biggest
electric-appliance manufacturers. His factory, financed with
Taiwan cash and stocked with new Taiwan-made production
lines, is clean and bright, unlike the typically sooty and
ill-lit mainland sweatshops.
   "We are trying to introduce the concept of private
enterprise in China," says Mr. Liu, who looks every bit a
foreign import himself in his crisp blue shirt and expensive
red silk tie. "In 10 years, China is going to look more and
more like Taiwan."
   It is one of the cold war's great ironies. The tiny,
breakaway island of Taiwan, whose anti-Communist rulers once
devised plans for militarily retaking the mainland, now is
launching a peaceful invasion that is helping prop up China's
ailing socialist economy. Even when tourist revenue and
foreign investment in general plummeted in the wake of last
year's political upheaval in China, the flood from Taiwan
continued to surge.
   "Taiwan no longer is trying to recover the mainland," says
David Shambaugh, a Sinologist at the University of London.
"It's trying to buy it back."
   Chinese officials are ecstatic about what they call "the
big typhoon" from Taiwan. But many Xiamen people aren't so
happy about the influx of so many of their wealthy Taiwan
compatriots.
   "True, the Taiwanese are helping develop our economy,"
says Li Liwei, a young elementary school teacher in Xiamen.
"But they adopt an air of superiority toward Chinese on the
mainland. They seem to think all Chinese women are either
prostitutes or potential mistresses."
   Taiwan's capitalists aren't investing in China out of any
desire to build up the backward mainland. They have come
because there is money to be made here, and because the
luster is starting to fade on Taiwan's economic miracle.
   Taiwan has enjoyed years of high-speed, trade-led growth.
Exports last year were more than $66 billion, helping push
average income for the island's 20 million people to more
than $8,500, one of the highest levels in Asia. But runaway
development and new-found wealth -- Taiwan has foreign
exchange reserves of about $70 billion, nearly equal Japan's
-- have also led to steep land prices, rising labor costs and
a strong local currency. All this has led many Taiwan
businesses, particularly in low-tech, labor-intensive
industries, to invest in less-developed parts of Asia.
   For many, the best locale is Fujian, a coastal province of
28 million people. Although direct travel from Taiwan still
is barred, Taiwanese and Fujianese speak the Minnanhua
dialect, and most Taiwanese have local family connections
dating to 1949, when the Nationalist Chinese fled and set up
a government in Taipei.
   At Xiamen's Heping Ferry Pier one recent day, Wang Zhifang
is awaiting one of those relatives, a long-lost uncle. The
uncle had happened to be in Taiwan on business in 1949, when
the Nationalists broke off contact with the mainland. Family
reunions resumed just two years ago.
   When the uncle finally appears, arriving by boat from Hong
Kong, his elderly sister, separated from him for four
decades, rushes forward. The two shake hands politely, and
she quickly turns her attention to the loot he has lugged for
his poor relatives on the mainland: a refrigerator and a
color television set. The Wangs happily load their new
appliances into a pedicab and speed home with the uncle, who
will spend several weeks checking investment opportunities.
   Chinese statistics show that more than 500 Taiwanese
investors have plunked about $1 billion into Fujian. More
than half have set up shop just in the last year, producing
everything from shoes and sweaters to bicycles and
appliances. About 40 Taiwan business delegations arrive in
Fujian each day, officials say.
   Most of the investments are in Xiamen, a quiet island
enclave known in colonial times as Amoy. Three years ago,
Xiamen had 20 enterprises involving Taiwanese investment;
today it has 300. Now Taiwanese are snapping up Xiamen
property with the very unsocialist aim of land speculation.
   Chen Han-fu, the 41-year-old president of New Asia Jewelry
Co., is one of the fortune-hunters. He moved to Xiamen with
his family in 1987 to make seashell and jade trinkets. He was
one of the first Taiwan businessmen to come here, a daring
pioneer at a time when Taiwan's government still was trying
hard to bar such investments. Taiwan still hasn't legalized
them, but the ruling party has said it will introduce a law
permitting indirect investment, such as that by offshore
subsidiaries. Taiwan's own domestic economic concerns and the
surge in underground investments on the mainland have led
officials in Taipei to turn a blind eye.
   It was rising labor costs that drove Mr. Chen to Xiamen.
He shut his factory in Taiwan and shipped his equipment here.
He pays his 150 workers in Xiamen about $40 a month,
one-thirtieth his old cost.
   "In Taiwan I had to pay my driver $1,000 a month and he
still complained," says Mr. Chen. "Here I pay $25 and my
driver obeys my every command."
   Now that he has a beachhead, Mr. Chen will go for the big
money: in land development. Draftsmen sit in his offices
drawing up blueprints for a 22-story commercial building he
will build for other Taiwanese businessmen. The draftsmen
work for China's navy. "In China," he says with a smile, "if
you don't have connections, you're finished."
   Xiamen is a speculator's dream. Although socialist China
doesn't sell land, the local government will sell "land-use
rights" for periods up to 70 years. Purchasers can resell the
rights, even for exorbitant profits. Mr. Chen bought rights
to his development property three years ago for $64 a square
meter. Today it's worth $850 a meter and rising.
   Of course the bubble may someday burst. But Taiwanese
high-rollers think there's a long way to go first. Fueling
the bullishness is speculation that a man named Wang
Yung-ching is about to invest a fortune in Xiamen.
   Mr. Wang, the hugely rich founder of Taiwan's Formosa
Plastics Group empire, has traveled to the mainland several
times to discuss investing in a huge petrochemical plant.
Chinese officials say Mr. Wang has proposed sinking up to $7
billion into the venture, while the Chinese would invest $5
billion in infrastructure.
   The project, which is rumored to have the personal backing
of Chinese Premier Li Peng, is viewed as a key indicator of
Taiwan-China relations. If the investment proceeds, thousands
more Taiwanese companies will probably follow suit.
   Moreover, an investment by someone of the 73-year-old Mr.
Wang's stature might prod Taipei to lift its objection to
direct transportation links, investment and trade with the
mainland. But so far, the Taiwan government has fought to
stop the project, fearful that it might help prop up the
Communist government in China. Mr. Wang is intent on going
ahead with the plant, according to business associates.
   "A project like this could turn Xiamen into a world-class
oil center and provide employment opportunities for a million
people," says Chen Kong-li, director of the Taiwan Research
Institute in Xiamen. But he also cautions: "I'm not sure the
Chinese can come up with their $5 billion share."
   Until such a breakthrough comes, or until Taipei lifts its
restrictions, most Taiwanese investors in China are likely to
keep their heads down. Such caution creates unusual
situations. Taiwan's biggest company in Xiamen is a
well-known Taipei manufacturer that doesn't want its name
published, even though nearly everyone in Xiamen, including
visiting Taiwanese officials, is aware of its presence here.
   The rationale seems to be: Investors can skirt Taiwan's
law and invest in China as long as they aren't too obvious
about it. The company's manager, Liu Yuen-chi, will happily
talk about his business, but only if his firm's name isn't
mentioned.
   And so, Company "X" churns out toasters, irons and coffee
makers for well-known Japanese, European and U.S. brand-name
sellers. Last year, the factory's 700 workers produced $12
million worth of appliances. Even 1989's political upheaval
and Tiananmen Square massacre didn't damp business or the
company's resolve to stay. "We just kept working as usual,"
says Mr. Liu. "Taiwan people don't want to stir up things
politically here. If the mainland is in chaos, Taiwan will be
hurt as well."
   The entrepreneurs who live in Xiamen tend to stick
together. They meet at places like the Taiwan Sea Food
Restaurant, whose walls bear "Tong Ching Lions Club" banners
from Taiwan and an altar of three Buddhas-good-luck symbols
in Taiwan. After hours, the businessmen and their money
usually end up in places like the "karaoke" sing-along bar at
the Xiamen Mandarin Hotel. With a cover charge of $20, it's a
luxury few mainlanders can afford.
   Lai Yen-hsing is preparing to mount the small stage at the
bar to sing a Taiwan ditty about drinking. He is tipsy, as
are his companions. Mr. Lai recently set up a factory in
China to make noodles. After a few months here, he married a
local woman. But he isn't happy in Xiamen.
   "There isn't any freedom or democracy in China," he shouts
over the crooning of another Taiwan businessman, who has
begun slurring a rendition of the Beatles song "Yesterday."
"I came here to make money. But if I fail, no problem. I'll
just leave."
   Attitudes like this have unsettled many local people and
led to friction. The newcomers, they complain, care only
about cash. "These Taiwan guys come to the bar and say, `I
want the most expensive liquor you've got,'" says Zheng Long,
accounts manager for the Lujiang Hotel. "They don't care what
it is, just as long as they're paying a lot for it." So shop
owners jack up prices, and many people complain about
inflation fueled by the Taiwanese.
   But if relations are tense, the situation still is better
than in earlier times, when the two sides used to shell each
other across the strait. As a reminder of the bad old days,
the Chinese have left standing the remains of a
colonial-style office building that was shelled repeatedly by
the Taiwanese in 1958.
   Preserving the house, however, offers an inadvertent
propaganda victory to Taipei. For the half-destroyed,
crumbling building is home to three Chinese families --
assigned there by the cash-strapped local branch of the
Communist Party.
   Small wonder, then, that Party authorities are willing to
put up with some inconveniences to get at Taiwan's billions.

   House Armed Services Committee Votes
   To Keep Military Bases in U.S. Open

   WASHINGTON -- The House Armed Services Committee voted to
protect military bases in the U.S. from being closed in 1991,
while laying the groundwork for massive base-closings and
troop cuts in Europe over the next few years.
   As part of a $283 billion authorization bill for the
Pentagon, the committee voted to block Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney from closing any more domestic bases until at least
Jan. 1, 1992. But at the same time, the panel ordered the
Pentagon to provide Congress with a detailed plan examining
whether most of the 336,000 troops currently based in Europe
can't be brought back to the U.S. by 1994.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved an
$8 billion military construction bill that also shifts funds
toward U.S. bases and away from bases overseas. The spending
bill would cut more than $1.15 billion from the Pentagon's
fiscal 1991 budget and reduce U.S. contribution to North
Atlantic Treaty Organization infrastructure accounts by 50%.
   The Senate money bill wouldn't provide any funds for
construction in Japan or Korea, and cuts back sharply on
Pentagon requests for facilities in Europe.
   The appropriations measure represents a further $331
million cut beyond the House-passed version of the same bill.
While leaving some leeway for the Bush administration, the
committee joined the House in freezing any further U.S.
contributions for construction of a major NATO air base at
Crotone, Italy.
   The Armed Services Committee's authorization bill also
would cancel construction of the base. Authorization bills
set policy legislatively and provide a ceiling on the money
spent for programs. Appropriations bills represent the actual
money and allow committees to influence policy by their power
over the purse.
   The House committee's action doesn't affect plans to shut
down more than 80 domestic military bases picked for closure
by a blue-ribbon commission and ratified by Congress last
year. The panel, however, voted to reduce Secretary Cheney's
authority and flexibility to propose a "hit list" of
additional bases.
   Intent on concentrating on cutbacks outside the U.S., the
committee voted to require the Pentagon -- for the first time
since the end of World War II -- to draft plans for dual
basing of troops in Western Europe. Under this concept, most
of the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps units currently
stationed there, as well as their dependents, would be
brought back to U.S. bases. Small contingents of troops would
return periodically to a few European bases for training and
military exercises during six-month tours, but the cost of
keeping them there would be far less than under the current
system.
   Both the domestic and foreign base-closing provisions are
strongly opposed by the Bush administration and Republican
congressional leaders, and they are bound to prompt spirited
debate on the House floor.

   NEW YORK -- Stocks finished only slightly lower, despite a
big rout in bank shares.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 5.94 to 2899.26.
New York Stock Exchange volume surged to 176,810,000 shares,
the heaviest since July 24, when 181.9 million shares traded.

   Several bank and savings and loan stocks were taken down
in aggressive selling yesterday. Traders said the bad news
has been mounting, and yesterday the selling intensified in
dozens of shares. Among the big losers: Chemical Bank fell 1
to 22; Citicorp slipped 5/8 to 19 3/8; Wells Fargo tumbled 2
5/8 to 65 7/8 and Security Pacific slid 1 to 30 5/8.
   A page one article in this newspaper yesterday described
how many of the traditional profit centers of big banks are
eroding.
   Savings and loan associations weren't spared. HomeFed fell
1 1/8 to 10; H.F. Ahmanson dropped 3/4 to 19 and Great
Western Financial slipped 1/8 to 15 3/8. "Investors are
worried about California real estate," said Nancy Spady,
analyst at Morgan Stanley. "Unfortunately, I don't think
people are differentiating between commercial and residential
lenders." She said she maintains a "buy" recommendation on
Great Western Financial and Ahmanson because of their focus
on residential real estate lending. She added, "HomeFed's
credit-quality problems are linked primarily to multifamily
and commercial real estate outside of California."
   Traders said the market was full of crosscurrents
yesterday. The National Association of Purchasing Management
said its July index of business conditions fell to 47.4% from
51.1% in June. The decline ended three consecutive months of
increases. A reading below 50 indicates that the
manufacturing segment of the economy is generally declining;
above 50, that it is generally expanding.
   While this weak economic data gave a boost to bond prices,
stocks didn't fall significantly. Investors continue to look
beyond lagging economic indicators to hopes for stronger
corporate profits in the months ahead. Their enthusiasm for
earnings strength could be seen in Eastman Kodak, which
jumped 4 1/4, or 11%, to 42 3/8, making the stock the largest
gainer on the Big Board yesterday.
   Kodak earned $1.19 in the second quarter, up from 24 cents
the previous year; the results beat the consensus by 20
cents. Many analysts raised their full-year estimates after
the report.
   Earnings growth is still the dominant theme in the stock
market, but investors are searching for stocks in which they
can buy growth cheaply.
   "I sense a growing nervousness and bearishness," said J.
David Mills, portfolio manager at Boston Co. Advisers. He
said growth-stock investors are losing confidence that their
stocks will continue to be big winners in the second half.
"The ability to forecast earnings in this economy is tough,"
he added.
   So while high-profile growers, such as Procter &amp; Gamble,
which fell 1 1/4 yesterday to 85 1/2, get notched down day by
day, other stocks such as Fund American -- whose earnings
outlook is brightening after a five-year spate of stagnant
profits -- are turning up. Fund American gained 1 5/8 to 38
1/8 yesterday.
   Still, in a slowing economy, big multinational companies
are paying out more earnings in dividends, which attracts
many investors. Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard &amp; Poor's
"Outlook" newsletter, noted that dividend increases on an S&amp;P
universe of some 7,500 stocks this year may be the lowest
since 1971, the year President Nixon mandated a freeze on
corporate dividends. But while the dividend outlook on S&amp;P's
broad universe of stocks is sickly, dividends paid by the 500
S&amp;P companies are expected to grow about 8% this year.
   Through July, only 825 companies have increased dividends,
down from 1,037 a year earlier. Dividend cuts rose 36.5% for
the same period and omissions increased 88.5%, S&amp;P said.
   "The weakness in dividends is a direct reflection of poor
corporate profits, and it also reflects the increase in
corporate leverage," said Mr. Kaufman.
   Meanwhile, the recent rally in oil stocks continued as
September crude-oil futures rose well above $21 a barrel --
the price target set by OPEC at its meeting last weekin New
York trading. Exxon added 1/4 to 52 1/8 on two million
shares, Mobil rose 1/8 to 65 3/8, Amoco gained 3/8 to 56 and
Atlantic Richfield went up 1 1/8 to 130 1/2.
   Utility issues remained on the upswing as well; the Dow
Jones Utility Average posted its seventh consecutive advance
by rising 2.89 to 212.90. Detroit Edison climbed 7/8 to 29
5/8, Houston Industries gained 3/4 to 34 1/2, Public Service
Enterprise Group rose 5/8 to 26 1/8 and Scana added 3/8 to 33
3/4.
   Another traditional "safe haven" for investment funds, the

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Manville Trust Supports Payments Freeze

   The Manville personal-injury trust, which has run out of
cash needed to pay thousands of claims by asbestos victims,
said it supports a court-ordered freeze temporarily barring
it from paying any settlements or judgments.
   In a brief filed in federal appeals court in New York, the
trust said the freeze ordered last month by U.S. Judge Jack
B. Weinstein will give it some breathing room as it tries to
solve its current cash shortfall. The brief was filed in
response to requests by two groups of asbestos victims who
want the freeze lifted.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trust, which was formed as part of Manville Corp.'s
bankruptcy-court reorganization plan in 1986, also told the
appeals court that its financial condition has worsened
rapidly in recent weeks. Judge Weinstein began pressuring the
trust to restructure its financing after it told asbestos
victims that current settlements wouldn't be paid at all for
more than 20 years-long after most of the claimants will have
died. Asbestos, once widely used in insulation, causes cancer
and respiratory ailments.
   The trust said that as of June 30 it had total assets of
$2.62 billion, but only $156.2 million in cash. To pay the
claims that already have been settled, the trust needs cash
totaling $365.7 million, of which $68.9 million is payable
between now and March 31, 1991. After paying operating
expenses and litigation costs, the trust will need to borrow
at least $30 million by March 31, assuming that no additional
claims are settled in the meantime.
   "To date, the trust has been unable to find a lending
institution willing to make such a loan," the trust said in
the brief. "Pursuant to the terms of the Manville plan of
reorganization, the trust must continue to settle cases and
thus the trust's borrowing requirements will become more
severe." The trust said it is "severely restricted" in its
ability to convert its assets -- mainly Manville stock -- to
cash.
   Judge Weinstein also filed a response with the appeals
court, defending his power to issue the freeze and making it
clear that he has staked out broad authority over all
problems arising out of the Manville reorganization plan. The
judge's response said the trust faces a deficit of $19.6
million this year on claims that have already been settled,
and that the trust's current value will cover less than a
fourth of the 130,000 claims that so far have been filed.
   The response, filed on the judge's behalf by Kenneth
Feinberg of the New York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman,
Hays &amp; Handler, said the freeze and other changes sought in
the trust by Judge Weinstein shouldn't be seen as a
modification of the Manville reorganization plan. Instead,
Mr. Feinberg wrote, the changes are needed to ensure that the
plan is implemented as planned. Huge injury claims pushed
Manville into bankruptcy proceedings.
   In its filing, the trust said it won't object to an
extension of the freeze, which now is set to end Monday.
Judge Weinstein has given the trust until Monday to propose a
restructuring of its finances to alleviate the cash
shortfall.

   FORMER ASBESTOS MAKERS can pursue case to hold U.S. liable
for damages.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed
a federal claims court judge who had thrown out the
manufacturers' cases. The companies, which face thousands of
personal-injury suits for illnesses caused by asbestos, want
the government to be held partly responsible. Many of the
suits stem from workers' exposure to asbestos at Navy yards.
   The claims court judge had ruled that the suit had to be
thrown out because the companies had similar claims pending
in other courts when they brought the suit. But the appeals
court said the restriction on suing in claims court, which
mainly deals with contract disputes with the U.S. government,
only applies if the other suits are still pending when the
claims court takes action.
   The appellate decision sends the case back to the claims
court to decide whether the U.S. government is liable for
some of the damages. Joe Hollingsworth, an attorney for UNR
Industries Inc. and Eagle-Picher Industries Inc., said the
federal government should be held liable for some of the
damages because the U.S. specified that asbestos be used in
the shipyard work even after the government knew of the
health risks. He said that under contract law, the U.S. also
had a responsibility to disclose to the asbestos makers
information about the risks of the product.
   A spokesman for the Justice Department said the U.S. is
reviewing the decision and declined to comment further.
   Mr. Hollingsworth, of the Washington firm Spriggs &amp;
Hollingsworth, said that more than half of all asbestos cases
involve work for the U.S. military.

   BLACK LAWYERS SAY High Court's pro-civil rights era has
ended.
   A panel of constitutional law and civil rights experts
told lawyers attending the annual National Bar Association
meeting in Houston that they should not look to the U.S.
Supreme Court as a defender of civil rights and liberties in
coming decades.
   The NBA, a predominately black organization, was formed 65
years ago as an alternative to the American Bar Association,
which at the time didn't allow blacks to join. An estimated
1,000 attorneys attended the weeklong convention.
   The prevailing mood among some 200 lawyers who attended
the opening seminar early this week, "Minorities and the
Supreme Court 1990's: Reconstruction Revisited," was bleak.
There seemed to be a consensus that the second Reconstruction
Era had ended.
   "Do you remember the phrase, `I'm going to take this all
the way to the Supreme Court?'" asked panelist Kim Taylor,
director of the Washington's Public Defender Service. "Now
that phrase strikes terror in my heart." Ms. Taylor said the
High Court is made up of "mean-spirited conservative
crusaders who have no experience with poverty and racism."
   The panelists likened the coming years to the
post-Reconstruction period. During Reconstruction, the time
following the Civil War, the civil rights of blacks were
bolstered by new constitutional amendments and legislation.
But in the 1890s, the court turned its back on blacks by
adopting a separate-but-equal approach to racial equality.
   Linda Greene, a professor at University of Wisconsin Law
School, sounded the most pessimistic note when she said, "If
we are still resolving 19th century questions in the 21st
century, we must ask if significant change is possible within
the {legal} framework."
   But Stephen Carter, a professor at Yale University Law
School, said the hard times ahead might force blacks to be
more resourceful.
   "Most social movements . . . have succeeded without the
help of the courts," Mr. Carter said. "We have to ask what it
is we can offer as a common cause with the great majority of
voters. That's the only way you can elect a president."
   Julius Chambers, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, said he shared the panel's assessment of the
Supreme Court, adding that if nominee David Souter is
confirmed "we'll have two or three decades of conservative
decisions."
   Mr. Chambers called on the lawyers to lobby Congress so
that the proposed Civil Rights bill of 1990 is passed. That
law, in effect, would overturn a number of civil rights
rulings by the high court in the past few years.
   Still, Mr. Chambers urged the lawyers not to ignore the
Supreme Court. "Even if we devote more attention to the
political process we still need to focus on the court," he
said.

   A NEW SUIT IS FILED in the wake of the second McMartin
trial.
   Raymond Buckey, the former California preschool teacher
acquitted last week of child-molestation charges, has filed a
civil lawsuit against defendants that include Los Angeles
County, the former Los Angeles district attorney who brought
the 1984 indictment against Mr. Buckey, as well as Capital
Cities/ABC Inc. and a former reporter who covered the
McMartin case.
   A spokesman for the county declined to comment on the
lawsuit. The former prosecutor and ABC couldn't be reached
for comment.
   Mr. Buckey is claiming damages for violation of his civil
rights, malicious prosecution, defamation and conspiracy,
according to his attorney, Scott Bernstein of the Los Angeles
law firm of Bauer, O'Brien &amp; Bernstein.
   Mr. Bernstein said his client "will be seeking millions
and millions of dollars. . . . We can't give him back the
five years he spent in prison but maybe we can help him put
his life back together."

   AMERICAN FIRMS IN HONG KONG are seeking help from the U.S.
government.
   The law firms want the government to intercede in their
two-year effort to get permission to hire local lawyers. Last
week, Hong Kong Attorney General Jeremy Mathews informed the
Law Society, which represents the interests of Hong Kong
firms, and several foreign law firms that the rules wouldn't
be altered. The Law Society has agreed to terms providing for
"close association" between local and foreign law firms and
fee-sharing arrangements, but it's opposed to the hiring of
local lawyers by foreign firms.
   "We are going to continue" to fight the policy by using
"the resources of the U.S. government," said Ben Fishburne,
co-chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce Legal
Committee in the territory. "There are trade-law remedies
that are available to us. In the meantime, we will work with
the U.S. consulate and do what we can through jawboning,"
said Mr. Fishburne, a partner with the U.S. law firm of
Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue.
   In an interview during a visit to Hong Kong recently, U.S.
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said that for Hong Kong
"to take such a narrow view seemed out of character." He
described the government's decision as an "aberration" in
Hong Kong's reputation as a free market. Mr. Mosbacher said
that he was planning to raise the issue during his visit. He
declined to say with whom he would speak, but Mr. Fishburne
said later that Mr. Mosbacher discussed the matter with Hong
Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson.
   "We don't want to practice local law," said Mr. Fishburne.
"We just want local legal services under our roof. Lawyers
that work on the same projects work best in close proximity."

   Chiat Cuts Back
   Its Staff, Reduces
   Management Pay
   ----

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Chiat/Day/Mojo, widely considered among the
best ad agencies in the country, abruptly laid off about 40
people, and imposed pay cuts on management in the wake of
account losses and shrinking client spending.
   The deep cuts came as a shock to the ad industry. Chiat
has been one of the nation's most successful ad agencies in
recent years. It created the year's most talked-about ad, the
Eveready pink bunny campaign, and is well-known for its work
for Nissan, Reebok, and Arrow shirts, among others. It
retained its reputation for breakthrough creative work even
as it broke the $1 billion mark in world-wide billings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Chiat, like every other ad agency, has been hit by a
slowdown in client spending, along with client defections.
Just this year, Reebok pulled its $40 million domestic ad
account from the agency. More recently, Royal Caribbean
cruise lines put its $30 million to $35 million account up
for review. The agency has also lost some smaller accounts,
including Sara Lee, which had once billed about $12 million,
and Bissell, a carpet cleaning company, with billings of
about $10 million.
   But as losses piled up, the agency hasn't won any major
new accounts recently. "We've lost two big accounts. We've
got to deal with that," said Bob Wolf, chairman and chief
executive officer of the agency's North American operations.
"We've also got industry problems. We've got clients who are
cutting back on their expenditures, and we aren't immune from
that."
   Mr. Wolf said about 36 to 40 of Chiat's 1,100 staffers
were laid off, with all but half a dozen of those in New
York, where the Royal Caribbean account had been serviced.
The remainder were in the Los Angeles office. He added that
fewer than 20 senior managers and directors had taken pay
cuts of 10% or more.
   "We're trying to save some jobs by coming up with money in
a different way than just reducing staff," he said.
"Hopefully, it will also send a signal to everybody that this
isn't about lots of people losing their jobs and management
being fat and happy. We're shouldering part of this
responsibility."
   Mr. Wolf said the agency was also taking other measures,
including cutting back office staff and re-examining overhead
expenses like real estate. "We're obviously hopeful that
these will be temporary measures all around," he said. But he
added that Chiat isn't optimistic about the ad business in
the short term.
   "I think the whole country is tightening their budgets.
Everybody in the agency business is facing the same issues.
There's a real cautious attitude out there. People believe if
we aren't in a recession, we're close to being in a
recession." He added, "We aren't real optimistic that 1991 is
going to be a great year for the economy. We're responding to
get ourselves ready for any potential bad news that comes
along."
   Chiat's problems aren't just attributable to a poor
economy, though. The agency has had a history of difficult
relationships with clients, despite its reputation for
creativity. Chiat made its name in the 1980s with widely
acclaimed campaigns for Nike footwear and Apple computers,
among others, yet both clients dumped it soon afterwards.
   Similarly, Chiat won notice and some notoriety for its
latest Reebok campaign -- including a commercial banned by
the networks because it featured bungee jumpers diving from a
bridge -- before Reebok fired it. Industry executives say the
agency has a reputation for sometimes being haughty and for
patronizing clients who don't agree with its creative ideas.
Chiat's design unit, Bright &amp; Associates, also laid off about
a dozen people in its New York and Los Angeles offices. The
move was especially surprising to staffers, since Bright had
just moved to new quarters in California and had held a big
opening bash just last Friday.
   Keith Bright, chairman and chief executive officer,
declined to comment on numbers, but confirmed that he laid
off staffers and that the top half-dozen managers took pay
cuts. "We have a number of projects that {clients} are
putting on hold," he said. "The big projects aren't as fast
coming around as they used to be. Just like advertising has
cut back, they {design clients} have cut their projects
back."

   Money fund assets continued to climb even as yields
continued to slip. The average seven-day compound yield,
which assumes reinvestment of dividends, dropped to 7.84%
from 7.88%.
   Martha Wittbrodt, editor of the Holliston, Mass.-based

recent easing of interest rates. But money funds continue to
draw deposits because their yields still beat those of
competing short-term investments, such as Treasury bills.
   Average maturity of the taxable funds remained the same in
the week ended Tuesday, at 44 days. That's within the range
of the last few months; average maturity has been as short as
29 days and as long as 53 days in recent years. Money funds
invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.56% from 7.59%. The average 30-day simple yield
also eased, to 7.62% from 7.65% and the average 30-day
compound yield dropped to 7.91% from 7.94%
   Yields on tax-exempt funds were flat to down. The average
seven-day compound yield of 226 tax-free funds remained at
5.21%, Donoghue's reported. The latest yield is equivalent to
7.24% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and 7.78% for
someone paying 33% in taxes.
   Assets of the tax-exempt funds decreased to $78.7 billion
from $78.8 billion. Average maturity remained at 51 days.

   Ranchmen's Resources Ltd. said it agreed to purchase the
oil and natural gas assets of Bralorne Resources Ltd. for 33
million Canadian dollars (US$28.6 million).
   The Calgary, Alberta, concern said the acquisition will
help it achieve its goal of balancing its production between
oil and natural gas. The Bralorne assets include estimated
proven gas reserves of 53 billion cubic feet and 1.4 million
barrels of proven oil and natural gas liquids reserves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ranchmen's also will acquire 50,000 acres of undeveloped
land and nine gas plants. The properties are concentrated in
east-central Alberta and farther north near Peace River,
Alberta.
   Bralorne's oil and gas division accounted for about 40% of
the company's assets but only about 15% of its operating
revenue, the Calgary concern said. Its other two operating
divisions, the Canadian and U.S. industrial groups, provide
products and services for the drilling and exploration
sectors of the energy industry in North America.

   FHP International Corp., a health maintenance organization
based in Fountain Valley, Calif., said earnings for its
fourth quarter, ended June 30, will be hurt by a recent $10
million jury verdict against it.
   In a medical malpractice suit, the jury awarded the
plaintiffs $10 million plus interest and costs, FHP said. As
a result, FHP will increase its malpractice reserves for
claims relating to the period 1975-83.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   FHP said its medical treatment was entirely appropriate in
this case and that it intends to request a new trial and to
seek a reduction of damages. If the requested relief isn't
granted, it will appeal.
   The company said it hasn't determined the suit's exact
impact on earnings for the fourth quarter and the year. In
the year-earlier fourth quarter, FHP posted a $7.7 million
profit, or 65 cents a share, on revenue of $199.3 million.
For fiscal 1989, FHP reported net income of $22 million, or
$2.05, on revenue of $699.1 million.
   The company declined to provide further details on the
malpractice case.

   Independent directors of Oakbridge told Oakbridge holders

they can withdraw their acceptance if Elders Resources
doesn't achieve compulsory acquisition of all Oakbridge
shares.

   Elders Resources is attempting to fend off a rival bid
from a Japanese-Australian consortium led by TNT Ltd.'s coal
mining associate McIlwraith McEacharn Ltd. McIlwraith leads a
consortium with Nippon Oil Ltd. and Toyo Menka Kaisha Ltd.
that wants to take over Elders Resources' controlling stake
in Oakbridge.
   McIlwraith raised its bid for Oakbridge this week to 91
Australian cents (72 U.S. cents) a share from A88 cents a
share. Elders Resources then lifted its conditional bid to
A91 cents a share.
   Elders Resources is offering A88 cents a share, as well as
a conditional A91 cents a share if it reaches the 90%
acceptance level required for compulsory acquisition of the
shares outstanding.
   National Mutual withdrew its acceptance of Elders
Resources' offer for National Mutual's 3.5% stake in

   Logicon Inc. said its net income dropped 32% in its first
quarter ended June 30 because of problems with a $30 million
contract to provide air traffic controller training systems
for the U.S. Navy.
   Logicon, a Los Angeles-based supplier of electronic
systems and high-tech services, said net income was $1.8
million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $2.6 million, or
58 cents a share, in the same period last year. Revenue rose
7% to $63.5 million from $59.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Logicon said its earnings drop stemmed from a $1.1 million
pretax loss provision on the Navy contract. A company
spokesman said that if it weren't for the contract loss,
Logicon's net income would have risen slightly in the
quarter.
   The spokesman said Logicon has filed for an adjustment in
the contract, saying the Navy imposed changes in system
performance criteria that weren't included in the contract.
These changes increased costs to the company and caused
delivery delays.

   Berliner Stadtbank was spun off as an independent banking
group as part of the April 1 banking reform in East Germany.
Its shareholders are the Staatsbank Berlin, successor to the

   Stadtbank at the beginning of July opened 13 branch
offices in East Berlin in an effort to start up a
retail-banking business.
   Meantime, Berliner Bank said it will "support with all its
power" the new East German partner's aim to become a
competitive universal bank.
   Once the transformation of Berliner Stadtbank is complete,
the two companies will merge into one legal entity under
Berliner Bank's name and management control, the official
said.

   Stamp of Stempel,
   New GM Chairman,
   Has No-Frills Look
   ---
   Emphasis Is on `Teamwork'
   And Off Finance Aides
   At First On-Job Parley
   ----

</IN>
<LP>
   DETROIT -- The Stempel Era at General Motors Corp. has
begun, even if new GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel doesn't like
that label.
   "Frankly, we aren't looking for stories on Bob Stempel,"
Mr. Stempel said during a first-day-on-the job news
conference yesterday. "We want the focus to be on GM and GM
products."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thus did Mr. Stempel, who turned 57 years old a month ago,
launch his administration of the world's largest industrial
corporation. He said GM is done with big acquisitions,
already has announced all the factory shutdowns it needs to
make, and is concerned that consumers may be jittery about
the economy in the wake of the savings-and-loan fiasco.
   But the nuances were more important than the news. Among
them:
   -- The finance men and central-office staffers who ran GM
for decades are taking a back seat, literally. The executive
vice presidents in charge of finance and corporate staffs sat
farthest away from Mr. Stempel on the dais at yesterday's
briefing. And they were the last to make presentations. Mr.
Stempel's hand-picked executive team is dominated by people
like himself -- engineers and executives with broad vehicle
operations experience.
   -- Mr. Stempel wants to avoid the fate of his predecessor,
Roger B. Smith, who became The Issue at GM. The new chairman
shared the spotlight yesterday with GM's six other top
executives, and deferred to each in turn to discuss his area
of responsibility. All together, the seven men used the words
"team" or "teamwork" 27 times in just over an hour.
   -- The new philosophy at GM is back-to-basics. "We've been
through enough mergers, diversifications, and acquisitions
for a while," said Mr. Stempel. "I look for this team to
focus on cars and trucks." Lloyd E. Reuss, 53, who as GM's
new president is assuming one of Mr. Stempel's former titles,
added that it's now time "to move the organizational focus
from what we are going to do to how we get it done. The `how'
is always much more difficult than the `what.'"
   Messrs. Stempel and Reuss said GM's traditional top-down
management style is going to change. "There's a definite
effort to reduce layers of management," Mr. Stempel said. "A
definite effort to move decisions down" closer to local
operations. However, he declared: "We aren't going to take GM
apart and put it back together again."
   That's what Mr. Stempel's predecessor, Roger B. Smith, did
in 1984, when he shredded GM's huge body and assembly
divisions and reassembled the pieces as a large-car group and
a small-car group. But Mr. Stempel has shown in his career an
aversion to the big-bang approach to change.
   Instead, Mr. Stempel is making subtle changes in GM's
organizational structure. For example, for the first time GM
won't have a chief operating officer interposed between the
chairman and the major operating groups.
   In another first, GM's quality and reliability staff will
report directly to the chairman. That isn't a big change in
practice. The quality-control staff reported to Mr. Stempel
when he was president. But now quality improvement has as
much importance, at least symbolically, as financial
management.
   Likewise, the strategies Mr. Stempel and his colleagues
outlined for GM's key markets reflected changes in emphasis,
not sudden switches.
   The man running overseas operations, Vice Chairman John F.
Smith Jr. (no relation to the retired chairman), said GM is
"very bullish" on its prospects in Europe, and is hopeful for
a recovery in the battered Brazilian market. Mr. Smith also
said he'd like to export some of GM's new Saturn cars as part
of an effort to boost the auto maker's exports from North
America to 250,000 vehicles a year from the current 112,000 a
year.
   Mr. Reuss, who runs North American and component
operations, illustrated his strategy with a diagram --
immodestly labelled "Framework for Greatness" -- that looked
like a plate balanced on a spear. Mr. Reuss said he'd like to
see plants working on the same three-shift systems that have
produced record profits in Europe.
   Robert T. O'Connell, the top finance man, said the finance
staff's new role will be to act as "creative partner in
helping the company achieve true greatness."
   This optimistic talk reflects the urge for a honeymoon
period for Mr. Stempel among many GM employees. But a
honeymoon, if any, will be brief. GM still faces a struggle
to boost the marginal profits in its North American auto
operations. More immediately, Mr. Stempel must negotiate a
new national contract with the United Auto Workers union,
which is furious over plant closings in recent years. UAW
leaders issued a statement yesterday hailing the new chairman
as a "car guy," but warning that he mustn't "treat workers as
expendable."
   Still Mr. Stempel sounded upbeat.
   "I felt terrific this morning," he said. "Someone on the
radio said, `Guess who's got a new job today?' And they
mentioned my name."

   Including the unissued portion of an earlier shelf
registration, the St. Louis-based defense contractor said it

   The aerospace concern said it intends to use the net
proceeds from the sale of securities to finance inventories,
provide other working capital, repay debt and for general
corporate purposes.
   Last week, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors
Service Inc. each lowered their ratings on debt of McDonnell
Douglas, citing its weakened financial condition and the
troubles it is having with military programs, such as cost
overruns on the Navy's A-12 attack plane. According to S&amp;P,
total debt of McDonnell Douglas and its finance unit is $5.2
billion.

   Under the plan, a venture capital investor and bank that
held convertible subordinated debt of Tons of Toys will
exchange this debt for shares of convertible preferred stock
of Tons of Toys. The plan also requires a reverse stock split
in which public holders of Tons of Toys common stock will
convert every 34.85192 shares of common stock for one share
of common stock. T.H.E. shareholders will hold about 65% of
the combined companies. Unsecured creditors are expected to
receive about $2.8 million, or 20 cents on the dollar, of
their claims.

   Bank Niaga, Indonesia, which is T.H.E. Corp.'s principal

the bankruptcy proceedings will allow Tons of Toys to resume

supermarkets in the Northeast. T.H.E. operates 32 stores in

   Pan Am Says Loss
   On Continuing Lines
   Shrank in 2nd Period

   NEW YORK -- Pan Am Corp., citing sharply higher revenue at
its Pan American World Airways unit, said its losses from
continuing operations in the second quarter were half those
of the year-earlier period.
   The airline holding company reported a net loss of $49
million, or 33 cents a share, wider than the year-earlier net
loss of $7.7 million. But the 1989 results were helped by a
$92.1 million gain on the sale of a unit and $1.3 million in
income from discontinued operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The carrier's loss from continuing operations narrowed to
$49 million from $101 million. The year-earlier loss from
continuing operations was deepened, however, by $28.2 million
in charges associated with Pan Am's unsuccessful bid for NWA
Inc.; no comparable expense was incurred in the latest
period.
   Revenue climbed 12% in the latest quarter to $1.02 billion
from $909.4 million.
   Thomas G. Plaskett, Pan Am chairman and chief executive
officer, said, "We are encouraged by our second-quarter
results, not only by the substantial improvement over last
year but by the improving trends we recorded during the
quarter."
   Pan Am said passenger traffic in the latest period rose
4.7% and was its highest ever for a second quarter. A
spokeswoman said revenue from that traffic showed an increase
of 16%, reflecting a greater proportion of passengers flying
in first or business class.
   The company said it turned a profit in June, the first
month since August 1988 that it has done so. In composite New
York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Pan Am shares closed
unchanged at $2.125.

   Heard on the Street:
   Growth Stocks Cast a Shorter Shadow

   Leaders of Market
   Keep Falling Away

HEARD ON THE STREET (HRD)
STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- If you listen closely, you'll hear a faint
hissing coming from the stock market. It's the sound of air
escaping from growth stocks.
   While investors have focused on the almost daily casualty
list of stocks that plunged after reporting disappointing
earnings, a broader erosion has occurred. Many other
once-highflying growth stocks have suffered slow leaks,
steadily sinking on significant volume.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stocks such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot have fallen between
15% and 20% within the last three weeks without any negative
surprises. Microsoft and Circus Circus Enterprises have each
fallen more than 10% in the same period, apparently because
of comments from management or Wall Street analysts that were
only mildly negative.
   And yesterday Boeing and Procter &amp; Gamble -- two of the
market's biggest growth stocks, which are generally defined
as companies that are expected to report rapidly increasing
earnings -- each fell more than a dollar a share without any
specific negative news.
   Several market strategists and growth-stock analysts say
the slow leaks have been caused by fears that if McDonald's
or Lotus Development can report disappointing sales or
earnings, then so might other growth companies.
   "There has been a tendency, particularly in the last two
weeks, to do a little profit-taking in the winners whether
there was a disappointment or not," says Robert J. Farrell,
chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. "It started when we
had some of the breaks begin to appear in the technology
stocks and McDonald's."
   Says Eldon Mayer, chairman of Lynch &amp; Mayer, a
growth-stock oriented money managment firm: "People are
saying, `I got zapped on my United Telecommunications' and my
Sallie Mae, so I'm getting nervous about my Wal-Mart.'"
United Telecommnications' stock has fallen 36% since it
reported a 55% drop in second-quarter net income; the stock
of Sallie Mae, or Student Loan Marketing Association, has
fallen about 20% in the past two weeks because of its
potential exposure to a financially troubled student-loan
guarantee organization.
   Market strategists and growth-stock followers are nearly
unanimous about one implication of the price weakness among
otherwise untarnished growth stocks: It is yet another sign
of the narrowing of stock-market leadership.
   In other words, although the stock market is still just
100 points shy of its all-time high as measured by the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, its advance is being led by a
now-dwindling group of darling stocks. That narrowness, or
lack of "breadth," as the market technicians call it, usually
is viewed as a sign of a weak market, vulnerable to
practically any shock of negative news.
   For a while, Mr. Mayer says, stock-market bulls had argued
that the market's narrow leadership wasn't necessarily a bad
sign, because the rest of the market would soon catch up with
the few dozen stocks that tend to drive the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index.
The bears, of course, argued that it was only a matter of
time before the leaders would fall back to join the market's
rank and file in the doldrums.
   "It definitely feels to us as though the jury's verdict
has been delivered," Mr. Mayer says. "Until further notice,
the leadership of the market is in a narrowing phase, and
that has to be bad news to investors in general. The hope of
the market breadth improving is pretty much dashed now."
   "This is a market that is only interested in a narrow
group of growth stocks," says Steven Einhorn, portfolio
strategist at Goldman, Sachs. "That is a market that doesn't
have a healthy foundation, which is a market that is
vulnerable. This is a market that will not prove to be
rewarding relative to bonds or relative to cash." As a
result, Mr. Einhorn is recommending that balanced accounts
remain only 50% invested in stocks, with 40% in long-duration
bonds and 10% in cash.
   "Those stocks that keep their earnings intact will
outperform the market on a relative basis," Mr. Einhorn says.
"From here, the problem is likely to be that there will be
fewer and fewer that keep their record intact."
   Other strategists offer different interpretations of the
current sag in growth stocks. Some call it merely a temporary
correction, a natural consequence of the rapid run-up in
growth stocks this year.
   L. Keith Mullins, head of the growth-stock research group
at Morgan Stanley, notes that his firm's index of emerging
growth stocks gained 26% from the end of January to the end
of July, while the S&amp;P 500 rose only 8.2% during the same
period. "I think that any advance of that magnitude should be
followed by the magnitude of a 10% to 15% correction," Mr.
Mullins says.
   Such a decline, however, should be healthy for the broader
market, Mr. Mullins says, because he believes growth stocks
will then lead another market advance.
   Mr. Mullins argues that the minicrash of last Oct. 13,
sparked by the failure to obtain financing for a UAL buy-out,
was a turning point. Investors suddenly soured on buy-out
candidates and cash-flow analysis, refocusing instead on
corporate earnings.
   "It took from 1981 to 1989 for the market to get that
focus on cash-flow analysis," Mr. Mullins says. "It's going
to take several years to unravel that process, and it won't
be a straight line."
   However, Mr. Mullins expressed confidence that investors
haven't lost their taste for growth and begun a shift into
cyclical stocks, whose earnings tend to rise and fall with
the ups and downs of the national economy. "At this stage, I
don't think there's any evidence that the fundamental shift
that occurred in the market last October has changed. If you
do believe that, you buy on weakness here."
   Mr. Mayer agrees that the growth-stock enthusiasm of the
past few months "is not being replaced by a rotation." He
says that longer-term investors, who are willing to wait two
or three years for their profits, shouldn't be worried by
recent growth-stock weakness.
   "I don't think you can make the case that these stocks are
grossly overpriced," says Mr. Mayer, who points out that
growth stocks today are trading at far lower multiples of
their per-share earnings than growth stocks were at the
1972-73 market top.
   Mr. Farrell of Merrill Lynch slices the growth-stock pie a
bit differently, pointing out that investors seem to be
punishing growth companies whose earnings are heavily
dependent on the U.S. domestic economy, such as Wal-Mart,
while remaining enthusiastic about drug companies, which draw
a substantial portion of their earnings from sales abroad.
The reason, Mr. Farrell suggests, is the increasing fear of a
recession in the U.S., combined with a declining U.S. dollar,
which makes sales in other currencies more valuable to U.S.
companies.
   Mr. Farrell doesn't see a stampede out of growth stocks,
but does believe there has been some rotation. He says
several growth-stock managers he talks to have moved money
into energy stocks, which have been rising along with oil
prices, and General Electric.
   To Mr. Mayer, a purchase of GE wouldn't represent a switch
out of growth stocks. Despite GE's huge size, Mr. Mayer
includes it on his short list of growth favorites.

   Kidder Peabody Picks
   Managing Director

   NEW YORK -- Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. named a new head of its
national sales force to jumpstart its strategy of focusing on
wealthy individuals, small companies and small institutions.
   The General Electric Co. unit named managing director
Michael A.M. Keehner to succeed Charles V. Sheehan in
overseeing Kidder's 45 branches that cater to individual
investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview, Mr. Keehner said he hopes to be "getting
our people better focused" and help the sales force better
target wealthy markets with the proper resources and support.
   The 47-year-old Mr. Keehner, currently chairman of Kidder,
Peabody International Ltd., has never been a broker. But he
has held a variety of management positions at the firm. Among
other things, he has headed Kidder's asset finance group, and
was president and chief executive officer of the firm's
exploration and production subsidiary from 1982 to 1988. He
also was chairman of Kidder Peabody Realty.
   Kidder, which has 1,400 brokers, has never been a major
force in the retail-investor market. But it recently has been
trying to carve out a niche in focusing on the higher end of
the individual-investor market, to separate itself from big
retail firms such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   In a statement, Michael A. Carpenter, Kidder's chairman
and chief executive, cited the "depth of his management
experience across many areas of the firm and his strategic
capabilities."
   Mr. Keehner will assume his new duties at the end of the
year, when Mr. Sheehan retires.

   ABA Head Reports Theft
   Of $55,000 Held for Client

   CHICAGO -- The annual meeting of the American Bar
Association in Chicago is off to an unusual start.
   Tuesday night, on the eve of the convention, ABA President
Stanley Chauvin discovered that $55,000 he had placed in a
hotel lockbox was missing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Chauvin, a 55-year-old Louisville, Ky., attorney,
received the money from a client Sunday night "in an escrow
transaction" in Louisville, a spokesman for the ABA said.
Lawyers in civil practice are frequently involved in escrow
transactions, in which money is held on behalf of clients
during certain proceedings. Such transactions, however, are
not usually conducted in cash. Because banks weren't open
Sunday and he was leaving for Chicago early Monday morning,
Mr. Chauvin took $55,000 in $100 bills with him on the plane
to Chicago.
   Upon his arrival at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, he rented a
deposit box and put a cloth bag containing the bills into it.
Tuesday night, Mr. Chauvin checked on the money and found the
box empty, the ABA spokesman said. He wouldn't identify the
client involved, citing attorney-client privilege.
   Mr. Chauvin wasn't available for comment yesterday. No one
at his Louisville firm, Alagia, Day, Marshall, Mintmire &amp;
Chauvin, would comment.
   A hotel spokesman said that it takes two keys to open the
deposit box -- the key of the renter and another key held by
hotel employees.
   The box didn't appear to have been broken into, said Sgt.
Booker Moore, a policeman called to the scene to investigate
the reported theft.

   TORONTO -- Operations were halted yesterday at two of
Canada's largest steel producers as about 16,000 union
members began striking following a breakdown of contract
talks.
   The shutdowns at Stelco Inc. and Algoma Steel Corp., a
subsidiary of Dofasco Inc., come as Canada's steel industry
is under pressure from a slowing domestic economy and
increased penetration of the Canadian market by U.S.
steelmakers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Leo Gerard, director of District Six of the United
Steelworkers of America, said the union, which represents
about 10,000 workers at Toronto-based Stelco, rejected what
the company has called its final contract offer, proposing
wage increases of about 2.5% in each year of a three-year
pact. The union is seeking a higher wage settlement and
better protection against inflation for workers and
pensioners.
   At Algoma, where the union represents about 6,000 workers,
monetary issues haven't been broached, Mr. Gerard said. Talks
with the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company broke down
over language concerning the contracting-out of work.
   Officials at both companies said an orderly shutdown of
operations had been underway for several days in anticipation
of a strike. Fred Telmer, president of Stelco's steel
division, said inventory stockpiles have been transferred to
customers. Mr. Telmer added, "We're in a closed mode."

minimum of $400 million in damages from the accounting firm
for allegedly faulty audits performed by one of its
predecessors, Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Deloitte Haskins, which merged last December with Touche
Ross &amp; Co., had performed audits of FirstSouth's books in
1983, 1984 and 1985.
   The suit specifically accuses Deloitte of ignoring
"grossly deficient underwriting" of loans and letters of
credit at the thrift; of failing to recognize that the thrift
was delaying the recording of losses on nonperforming loans
by "parking" the loans with insiders; and of failing to
detect violations of federal limits on loans to one borrower.
   The new lawsuit against Deloitte is the most recent of the
government's aggressive efforts to recoup some of its losses
from the failure of FirstSouth. Last year, the government
obtained $27.6 million through separate settlements with
FirstSouth's former law firm, the thrift's officers and
directors and a now-disbanded Dallas mortgage brokerage firm
that had placed several loans with the thrift.

   BSN Corp. said that PaineWebber Inc. is soliciting offers
to buy all or parts of the assets of the Dallas sporting
goods manufacturer. BSN expects the offers to exceed the
company's book value of $9.20 a share.
   BSN's board already has rejected unsolicited offers that
it considered inadequate. Houston-based Pelham Investment
Associates Limited Partnership has acquired 7.3% of the
company's shares and has sought to buy a controlling
interest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The BSN board commissioned an appraisal of the company in
response to the purchase inquiries. "The study showed us that
the value of the company is in excess of book value," said
Michael Blumenfeld, president. In trading on the American
Stock Exchange, BSN shares closed yesterday at $5.625, up
37.5 cents.
   BSN also said it postponed its plans to sell its Sports
Supply Group division in a public offering until it has
evaluated the response to PaineWebber's solicitation. The
board also expanded the company's share-repurchase program to
two million shares from one million subject to asset sales.

   WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office said the
Justice Department doesn't have the kind of information
system its new financial-institutions fraud chief needs "to
effectively oversee and coordinate" the government's attack
on thrift and bank crimes.
   The GAO told the Senate Banking Committee it sees "strong
indications" that the department is "gearing up and deploying
resources for increased effort against financial-institution
fraud." But the GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said
the department doesn't have a system to track bank and thrift
fraud cases, "how well the efforts are proceeding, what more
needs to be done, where it needs to be done, and what further
resources are actually needed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fact, James Richmond, the department's special counsel
for financial-institution fraud, has expressed frustration
over his inability to provide precise statistics on the
status and number of major cases being handled by regional
U.S. attorneys' offices. Such information is crucial in
making decisions about where to send additional resources. In
general, the Justice Department has moved slowly toward
creating case-management systems, which use computers to
track the status of cases.

   MILAN, Italy -- The Chamber of Deputies approved a bill
that restricts private ownership of Italy's press and
television and establishes strict guidelines for media
advertising. The bill now returns to the Senate, Italy's
upper house, where it's expected to have an easy passage.
   The measure strikes at the heart of issues -- media
financing and ownership -- that are intricately bound up with
both the wielding of political influence in Italy and the
financing of its political parties. It limits cross-ownership
of television stations and newspapers, particularly affecting
the media empire of Silvio Berlusconi, who controls three
television stations and the Milan-based daily Il Giornale.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper owners controlling more than 16% of the national
market will be banned from owning national television
stations, while those controlling between 8% and 16% of the
market will be restricted to one such station. Those with
less than 8% will be permitted to control two stations.
Groups with no papers will be allowed up to three stations.
Officials of Mr. Berlusconi's company, Fininvest S.p.A., say
the bill means he has to give up Il Giornale, and lose $86
million a year in advertising.
   The measure also limits the advertising breaks during
drama programs, restricts the showing of sexually explicit
material and requires private TV and radio owners to
broadcast news items.

   NEW YORK -- Evidence that the nation's industrial core is
contracting may be bad news for the economy, but it
invigorated the bond market.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said
yesterday that its index of business conditions declined to
47.4% in July, down from 51.1% in June. The index is designed
so that a reading below 50% should indicate that the
manufacturing segment of the economy is declining and a
reading above 50% should suggest that manufacturing is
expanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The NAPM report "got the market off to the races," said
Steve Ricchuito, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities Inc. He said the NAPM report, which followed a
string of anemic economic indicators, fueled speculation that
the economy is in trouble and that the Federal Reserve may
eventually come to the rescue by cutting short-term interest
rates.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than 5/8
point yesterday, which translates into gains of about $6.25
for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The yield on the
benchmark bond, which moves in the opposite direction of
prices, fell to 8.35%.
   Some analysts were surprised that bonds held their gains
considering oil prices spiked higher. Often, rising oil
prices rekindle inflation fears, which hurts bonds. But some
traders explained that bond investors view the rise in oil
prices as temporary.
   "People looked beyond {yesterday's} price move," said
Michael Moran, manager of government trading at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. He said that investors
believe the forces pressuring oil prices, "will go away
eventually." Prices for oil, as well as food and several
other commodity prices, are extremely volatile.
   Still, Mr. Moran suggests that oil prices could become a
negative factor for the bond market if prices continue to
rise, and especially if "some of the oil uptick finds its way
into," the producer price index report. The PPI, due to be
released next week, is a measure of inflation on the
wholesale level.
   The bond market didn't blink at news the Treasury intends
to sell $32.25 billion of securities next week at its
quarterly refunding of the government debt. Many analysts
were expecting the refunding to total about $31.5 billion.
   But given expectations of a weakening economy, lower
inflation and declining interest rates, more supply was
looked at by many participants as "an opportunity to buy"
bonds said Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji
Securities Inc., Chicago.
   The refunding will comprise a record $11.5 billion of
three-year notes scheduled for sale next Tuesday; $10.5
billion of 10-year notes scheduled for sale next Wednesday
and $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds to be sold next Thursday.
   The Treasury said the auctions would be contingent on
legislation raising the debt ceiling, which injects a note of
uncertainty that could push rates higher or keep them from
falling much further.
   When-issued trading will not begin until a debt ceiling
bill is passed, which means dealers will be less certain of
investor demand for the securities they are underwriting.
   In its quarterly refunding news release, the Treasury also
projected a massive net market borrowing requirement of
between $65 billion to $70 billion during the fourth quarter.
That will be a record amount of borrowing.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's announcement that it will sell a record
$32.25 billion of notes and bonds at next week's quarterly
refunding of the federal debt didn't move bond prices an
inch.
   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
104 8/32, up from 103 19/32. The yield eased to 8.35% from
8.41%. The latest two-year notes ended at 100 9/32, up from
100 7/32. The yield on the two-year notes fell to 7.83% from
7.86%.
   Short-term rates moved moderately lower yesterday. The
discount rate on three-month bills fell to 7.43% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.66%, while the rate on six-month
bills fell to 7.27% to yield 7.63%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Corporate bond investors put aside memories of the
Seabrook nuclear power plant's troubled history and eagerly
snapped up $211.8 million of secured lease obligation bonds
backed by the plant, which is now operating.
   United Illuminating Co., a major shareholder in the New
Hampshire nuclear power plant, indirectly issued $82.77
million of 16-year bonds priced at par to yield 9.76% and
$129.06 million of 30-year bonds priced at par to yield
10.24%.
   The transaction was structured as follows: The Seabrook I
bonds are considered obligations of United Illuminating. The
bonds were issued by Meridian Bank, the owner-trustee in the
transaction, which was acting on behalf of a unit of
Citicorp's Citibank unit, which invested $38 million for an
equity stake in the nuclear plant. In the sale-leaseback
transaction, United Illuminating sold a 7% stake in the
Seabrook plant to Meridian Bank.
   The bonds are secured by United Illuminating's lease
payments to Seabrook, as well as by the portion of the
Seabrook plant that was sold.
   Proceeds from yesterday's debt sale will be used to redeem
United Illuminating's outstanding high-coupon debt starting
in mid-August.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds ended 1/2 to 3/4 point higher.
   In the junk-bond market, concerns about the unraveling of
the buy-out offer for UAL Corp. damped sentiment in the
high-yield market, sending low-rated or unrated
speculative-grade securities 1/8 to 1/4 point lower.
   Among the junk bonds that registered marked declines were
Fort Howard Corp.'s 12 5/8% subordinated debentures which
fell 1/2 point to 97 1/2. The bonds started to drop after
news that the company's chairman and chief executive is
resigning.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds finished flat to 3/8 point higher.
   A little new supply came into the municipal market when a
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. group won the Maryland Department of
Transportation's $100 million consolidated transportation
revenue bonds, Series 1990.
   The bonds were priced to yield from 6% in 1993 to 6.80% in
2005. All bonds were sold by the time dealings finished.
   In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securites of 2018 ended 1/8 higher at 99 3/4, with the
yield unchanged at 7.21%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities closed higher.
   The issuance of derivative products stalled yesterday,
following Tuesday's introduction of $1 billion in new real
estate mortgage investment conduits.
   "There's no way to keep up the issuance we saw {Tuesday},"
said one trader. But, he added, with the market rallying, and
with expectations of lower interest rates intact, "we'll
definitely see some more deals soon."
   Among actively traded issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities were up 10/32 at 100 23/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% issues were up 15/32 at
97 26/32, and Federal National Mortgage Association 9% issues
were up 15/32 at 98 10/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The West German bond market set a record in new-issue
volume with the sale of eight billion of new 10-year
government bonds.
   The bonds, issued with a coupon rate of 8.5%, were sold
during two days. Three billion marks ($1.89 billion) of bonds
were placed Tuesday via the traditional federal bond
consortium. Yesterday, 2.9 billion marks of the bonds were
sold through a U.S.-style competitive auction and 2.1 billion
worth were allocated to the Bundesbank, West Germany's
central bank.
   Dealers said the bulk of both days' sales ended up in the
portfolios of West German banks or were purchased by
professional traders for arbitrage accounts.
   Other domestic investors showed little interest in the
bonds. International investors were light buyers at the
auction, dealers said. Japanese investors, who had been
expected to buy large amounts, took "very little," according
to a trader in the Frankfurt office of a Japanese bank.
   In the secondary market, prices of the new 10-year bonds
fell as much as 1/2 point, weighed down by the heavy supply,
recurrent reports of East Germany seeking more cash from West
Germany and a sell-off in the futures pit.
   Elsewhere, Japanese and British government bonds ended
moderately higher yesterday.

   WASHINGTON -- Looking for an ethical facelift before the
November elections, the Senate voted to overhaul the system
of financing congressional elections, including a ban on
honorariums, the controversial outside speaking fees that
many lawmakers use to pad their salaries.
   Splitting along partisan lines in a 59-40 vote, the Senate
approved a package of reforms sponsored by the Democrats. The
bill limits the amount of money congressional candidates can
spend on their general election campaigns, ranging from
$950,000 to $5 million depending on the size of the states;
bans political action committees; and, for the first time,
provides taxpayer subsidies for certain campaign costs such
as television air time and postage.

   Republicans are staunchly opposed to spending limits and
any use of public funds for congressional campaigns. Sen.
Mitch McConnell, who led the GOP opposition, said President
Bush was certain to veto the measure, which the Kentucky
Republican blasted as "a food-stamp program for politicians."
GOP senators were confident they could sustain a veto.
   The honorarium ban contained in the bill would take effect
next January. The bill also would limit senators' outside
earnings, including investments, to 15% of their $98,400
annual salaries. Senators may now accept as much as $39,360
annually in honorariums, equal to 40% of their salary.
   Last year, the House voted to ban outside speaking fees
beginning next January in exchange for a politically
controversial pay raise. The Senate rejected a pay raise, but
left the honorarium system intact.
   The outlook for campaign finance legislation in the House
is uncertain. While the leadership hopes to take up a bill
tomorrow, Democrats are still deeply divided over fundamental
issues such as spending limits and restricting PACs.
   Still, advocates of campaign finance overhaul, who have
been stymied since 1974, were encouraged by the Senate's
action. "We will have made huge progress," said Fred
Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the citizens' lobby.
"The handwriting is on the wall for the end of the honoraria
system," he added.

   LSI Industries Inc., Cincinnati, citing softness in its
commercial-lighting business and other factors, said it
expects to report a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of about $1.3
million, or 28 cents a share.
   That compares with year-earlier net income of $1.4
million, or 27 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales in the quarter, which ended June 30, the company
said, were $20.2 million, down from $22.1 million a year
earlier.
   For the full fiscal year, LSI said it expects to report
net income of $1.4 million, or 29 cents a share, compared
with net of $4 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales were $83.7 million, compared with $57.4 million last
year. Final audited figures are expected by mid-August.
   LSI said sales of its graphics group, which provides
commercial lighting, were below prior-year levels for the
June quarter principally due to graphics programs of certain
petroleum customers being deferred or reduced in scope.
Further, Duramark Ltd., LSI's graphics subsidiary, had
significant unexpected costs relating to entering the U.K.
and European architectural graphics markets, the company
said.

   Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp.'s net income reached $7.7 million
in the fiscal fourth quarter, or 54 cents a share, after a
year-earlier loss of $25.1 million, equal to $1.74 a share.
   The Milwaukee maker of light engines said sales in the

$190.5 million a year earlier. The company said the spring
lawn-and-garden selling season "was a pretty good one."

   For the fiscal year, profit hit a seven-year high of $35.4
million, or $2.45 a share, a substantial turnaround from the
previous year's $20 million loss, equal to $1.39 a share.
Sales rose 14% to $1 billion from $876.4 million, aided by a
19% rise in unit shipments of engines.
   Discussing fiscal 1991, officials said they believe
engine-unit shipments and sales "will be a bit lower." But
they added that the company "will be working to achieve
modestly higher earnings."

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Appropriations Committee approved
a $20.7 billion bill funding the Treasury and Postal Service
through fiscal 1991 and incorporating provisions to deploy
Secret Service agents in federal investigations of
savings-and-loan fraud.
   The final language represents a compromise between the
Secret Service and the rival Federal Bureau of Investigation,
which strongly resisted an initial House-passed proposal
giving the Secret Service new authority to initiate its own
S&amp;L inquiries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Senate bill is phrased to give authority to the
Justice Department to "accept" assistance from the Secret
Service. But within these parameters, the Secret Service
would have the same authority as the Justice Department to
conduct civil and criminal inquiries.
   "I believe it is critical that the Secret Service be
brought into the picture as soon as possible," said Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh, in a letter this week to the
appropriations leadership. Mr. Thornburgh's hand is
strengthened by the compromise. But the FBI came to the
negotiations reluctantly and, according to sources, was
apparently prodded by suggestions from the committee that it
could otherwise lose $98.4 million elsewhere in the bill for
its Washington field office.

   Reliance Group Holdings Inc. reported second-quarter net
income of $164.8 million, or $2.20 a share, largely because
of a one-time gain from the sale of the insurance company's
General Casualty subsidiary.
   In the year-earlier period, Reliance had a loss of $6
million, or 8 cents a share. Revenue in the recent quarter
rose 26%, to $1.15 billion from $911 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sale of General Casualty, completed in April, resulted
in an after-tax gain of $245.5 million. Another extraordinary
gain of $4.6 million resulted from early debt retirement, but
the gains were offset somewhat by losses totaling $80.7
million from the write-down and sale of various portfolio
holdings.
   New York-based Reliance blamed soft pricing and losses
from recent fires around Santa Barbara, Calif., for a drop in
profitability in its property and casuality insurance
operations, its largest lines of business.
   For the six months, Reliance reported net income of $174.4
million, or $2.33 a share, compared with $21.1 million, or 28
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 17.5% to $2.08
billion.

an honorarium ban.
   Lawmakers split along partisan lines in approving a
package of reforms sponsored by the Democrats, 59-40. The
bill limits the amount of money congressional candidates can
spend on general election campaigns; bans political action
committees; and, for the first time, provides taxpayer

   NEW YORK -- Loews Corp.'s second-quarter net income fell
41%, reflecting a 58% profit drop at its insurance business.
   Analysts said the fall in earnings in the insurance
business was expected. They were surprised, however, by the
15% drop in Loews's tobacco profit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Second-period net dropped to $192.9 million, or $2.60 a
share, from $329 million, or $4.38 a share, a year earlier.
The results also reflect a loss from realized investments of
$16.8 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with gains of
$61.5 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue at Loews, which has interests in hotels, watches,
ships and insurance, among other things, grew 3.4% to $3.09
billion from $2.99 billion.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Loews shares
dropped $4.50 to $99.75 on heavy volume of 643,000 shares.
   Earnings from the CNA Financial insurance business dropped
to $70.4 million from $169.5 million. The tobacco business,
which generates about 50% of the parent's profit, saw
earnings fall 15% to $104.5 million from the year-earlier
$122.8 million.
   "I wasn't expecting a shortfall in the tobacco business,"
said Diana K. Temple, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "The
earnings were about 40 cents less than I thought." The
company attributed the lower earnings at the Lorillard
tobacco operation to a drop in demand after prices were
raised in May.
   Loews also said it had purchased in the open market about
952,000 of its common shares during the past six months and
said it intends to buy additional shares periodically. At
June 30, Loews had an average 74.1 million shares
outstanding, down 1.3% from a year earlier.
   For the six months, Loews said net fell 22% to $416.6
million, or $5.60 a share, from $533.5 million, or $7.08 a
share, for the like 1989 period. Revenue rose 8.3% to $6.07
billion from $5.61 billion.
   The latest six-month results reflect a gain of $70.2
million, or 94 cents a share, on the sale of three oil
tankers.

   Southern Pacific Transportation Co. said it terminated an

line connecting Kansas City and Chicago; however, the company
said it reached a trackage rights agreement with Burlington
Northern Inc. that would give it a Chicago route.
   Financially troubled Southern Pacific, a San Francisco
unit of Denver-based Rio Grande Industries, had sought to

compete with Western rail rivals.

   But the company said it failed to gain the consent of
Chicago &amp; North Western Transportation Co., which has joint
ownership of a small portion of the line. Southern Pacific
had planned to spend $86 million to purchase the 532-mile
route from Soo and another $50 million to renovate the track
over three years.
   Having called off the agreement to purchase the line,
Southern Pacific said it reached a trackage rights agreement
with Burlington Northern. Under the agreement, Southern
Pacific will operate trains with its own locomotives and
crews on Burlington Northern's 466-mile route between Kansas
City and Chicago. Southern Pacific declined to discuss terms.
   Soo Line, a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian Pacific
Ltd., said the proposed sale of its line to Southern Pacific
had received unanimous approval from the Interstate Commerce
Commission. But Soo said it faced "excessive economic
demands" from Chicago &amp; North Western for consent to Soo's
transfer of ownership of a 37-mile portion of the line. CNW
Corp., Chicago &amp; North Western's parent, declined to comment.

   TAMPA, Fla. -- A federal grand jury returned indictments
against four employees of E-Systems Inc., alleging that the
men repeatedly falsified test results and other records
concerning the manufacture of U.S. Army field radios.
   "We are aware of the indictments," said a spokesman for
the Dallas-based defense contractor. "These employees are on
administrative leave. We can only extend to these employees
their constitutional guarantee of a presumption of
innocence." An investigation of the company continues.

   E-Systems closed its Memcor plant in Bushnell, Fla., in
1986 after the Army declared that the company was in default
on two contracts valued at $19 million and terminated the
contracts. E-Systems appealed, claiming $13 million in
damages. The criminal investigation arose from that dispute.
   The indictment alleges that three managers and a
supervisor at the Memcor plant ignored requirements to report
test failures and repairs on the Army field radios and
covertly created false documents on untested radios.
   The indictments charged the men with one count of
conspiracy to defraud the government and five counts of
making false claims. In a related case in January, Justice
Department attorneys won a conviction of Memcor production
supervisor Sadonna S. Hobbs for perjury. She was sentenced to
16 months in a federal correctional facility.
   E-Systems expects a speedy resolution of investigations, a
spokesman said.
   "The company is negotiating a complete resolution of all
matters pending," said Barbara Kittay, an attorney in the
Justice Department's fraud section.
   E-Systems announced a second-quarter after-tax charge of
$8.6 million to cover Memcor claims; the company expects no
further charges, the spokesman said.
   Charged in the indictment are Howard DeWight Rader, former
plant manager; Harley W. Hopson, former manager of quality
assurance; Houston Stanley Burke, former manager of test
production; and former quality assurance supervisor Paul R.

   House Approves $54 Billion Farm Bill,
   Limits Subsidies to Individual Growers

   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $54 billion, five-year
farm bill after voting to tighten limits on subsidies to
individual farmers.
   The omnibus legislation, adopted 327-91 last night, would
end the steady decline in farm-income supports under the
expiring 1985 farm law and would renew the major commodity
programs without any sharp departures in policy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The overwhelming vote was a victory for farm-bloc
lawmakers led by Agriculture Committee chairman Kika de la
Garza (D., Texas), who beat back or blunted repeated attempts
to cut farm spending and revamp several subsidy programs,
including sugar and peanuts.
   Earlier in the day, the House rejected a plan by Rep.
Silvio Conte (R., Mass.) to close loopholes in current
subsidy limits that let farmers collect as much as $500,000
annually from the government. Instead, the lawmakers adopted
a less restrictive amendment offered by Rep. Jerry Huckaby
(D., La.) that would put a $200,000 cap on cash subsidies and
other income supports paid to a single farmer.
   The House, in another minor concession to a coalition of
conservative Republicans and urban Democrats who sought to
overhaul the subsidy programs, adopted a plan to reduce the
maximum annual payment to individual beekeepers to $100,000
in 1995 from $250,000. The Senate has voted to phase out
honey subsidies altogether by 1995.
   Differences between the House and Senate versions of the
1990 farm bill will be reconciled in conference after
Congress returns from its August recess. The Bush
administration has threatened to veto the legislation unless
significant cuts are made in commodity and food-stamp
outlays. The House bill would increase spending on food
stamps and other nutrition programs by $5 billion over the
next five years. The Senate didn't include a food-stamp
provision in its bill.
   The House bill, among other things, would give farmers the
option to plant a variety of crops on 25% of the acreage they
customarily devote to subsidized crops. But farmers who take
advantage of this flexibility provision wouldn't qualify for
any subsidies on that land. The lawmakers' aim is to let
farmers make planting decisions in response to market demand,
rather than incentives created by the subsidy programs.
   The measure would freeze target prices for wheat, feed
grains, cotton and rice for the next five years, and it would
create a marketing loan for oil-seed crops, including
soybeans and sunflowers. Such loans are designed to prevent
the buildup of government-owned surpluses by promoting
exports. In addition, the bill would impose a dairy floor
price of $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk, and it would
require the government to adopt supply controls if
dairy-product surpluses exceed six billion pounds.
   Under the environment provisions of the mammoth bill, the
nation's Conservation Reserve for highly erodible land would
be expanded to 45 million acres from the current authorized
level of 40 million to include environmentally sensitive
land. The bill would also create a national agricultural
wetlands reserve by obtaining federal easements on prairie
"potholes" and other habitats for migratory waterfowl.
   In addition, the measure would revise controversial parts
of the so-called swamp-buster law, which regulates the
conversion of wetlands to agriculture. Farmers would be
allowed to drain wetlands that hamper farming operations as
long as they restore former wetlands of equal or larger size.
They also could drain small wetlands of minimal value to
wildlife. The bill would impose graduated fines for
inadvertent swamp-buster violations.

   MONTREAL -- Paul Desmarais Sr., a Canadian financier, and
Albert Frere of Belgium completed an agreement to pool their
combined controlling stakes in two big European holding
companies, Pargesa Holding S.A. and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert
S.A.
   Messrs. Desmarais and Frere, through companies they
control, together hold about 50% of Geneva-based Pargesa. Mr.
Frere holds about 8% of Brussels-based GBL, and Pargesa holds
37%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, Messrs. Desmarais and Frere will put
their Pargesa stakes into a new holding company and Mr.
Frere's GBL stake into a second new holding company. Each new
company will be equally owned by the two partners.
   An official at Power Financial Corp., a subsidiary of
Desmarais-controlled Power Corp. of Canada, said the
Desmarais and Frere groups will act together at Pargesa and
GBL, adopting common positions on matters such as board and
management representation, financing activities and purchases
and sales of assets.
   "It's essentially a joint venture," the Power Financial
official said. "We will achieve decisions by consensus."
   The agreement runs for 11 years and can be renewed for
five-year terms by mutual agreement. Each partner has a right
of first refusal to buy the other's interests in Pargesa or
GBL for five years after the termination of the agreement,
the Power Financial official said.
   Messrs. Desmarais and Frere said in February that they
held 50% of Pargesa and intended to work together closely.
   The Power Financial official said yesterday that the
partners "will be concentrating on what we see as our core
assets" at Pargesa and GBL. He wouldn't elaborate.

   Commodities:
   Reports of Renewal of Iraqi-Kuwaiti Tension
   Push Up Prices of Crude, Heating Oil, Gasoline

   Crude oil for September delivery at the New York
Mercantile Exchange jumped 85 cents a barrel in heavy and
sometimes frantic trading, finishing at $21.54. Heating oil
and gasoline prices roared upward as well, with many contract
prices climbing the daily limit set by the exchange.
   Rumors that Iraq had invaded Kuwait sparked the buying
binge. Reports that Iraq abruptly walked out of negotiations
with Kuwait, abandoning a second round of talks scheduled for
yesterday morning, provoked additional buying interest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Late last night, the Kuwaiti Embassy reported that Iraqi
troops crossed into Kuwait. The action followed the
deployment of about 100,000 Iraqi troops at Iraq's border
with Kuwait.
   Sharply higher prices are indicative "of the market's
concern that there could be some type of military action on
the part of Iraq," said Michael Rothman, senior energy
analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. "It was clearly a
case of buying the rumor."
   Officials of Kuwait and Iraq were meeting in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, to try to settle differences that threaten to disrupt
the current uneasy peace in the Middle East. Iraq is asking
Kuwait to compensate it for $2.4 billion of oil it alleges
was pumped from an oil field straddling their border. The
exact location of that border has been disputed by the two
countries for years.
   Iraq has also charged Kuwait with flooding the market with
crude oil to keep oil prices low and wreck the Iraqi economy,
which is heavily dependent on oil for revenue. It is also
demanding that Kuwait forgive the huge debt Iraq owes its
tiny neighbor. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia lent Iraq money to
support its 1980s war effort against Iran.
   Also considered bullish were reports by Dow Jones
International Petroleum Report that Kuwait told some U.S.
customers it was cutting the amount of crude it would sell
them for September delivery. Traders interpreted this as a
sign that Kuwait is going to comply with its daily production
quota of 1.5 million barrels set by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   But some market participants are leery of the sharp price
run-up. If Kuwait's production were suddenly removed from the
market, supply tightness would surely occur, but with
inventories near record highs, "fundamentally nothing has
changed," said Nauman Barakat, first vice president of energy
futures for Shearson Lehman Brothers. "A lot of the run-up is
emotion and hype."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices surged to fresh life-of-contract
highs in most deliveries on strong foreign demand. The
September contract ended with a gain of 4.25 cents a pound at
$1.2885 after trading at a contract high of $1.2920. A strong
boost also came from a U.S. Mint tender for the purchase of
8.7 million pounds of copper. Offering prices ranged from
$1.2839 to $1.3151 a pound, according to an analyst. He said
these high prices came in the face of continued indications
of a sluggish U.S. economy. "This means that the copper
industry is expecting tighter supplies later in the year,"
the analyst said. Market leadership at the moment is coming
from Western Europe and Japan, where demand is buoying
prices, he said. In futures, prices rose above previous
contract highs except for the most distant delivery months,
as aggressive buying of futures contracts by computer-guided
funds fueled the strong advance, the analyst said. Another
analyst observed that this is the third consecutive summer
that copper prices have rallied, contrary to a historical
pattern of sluggish summer consumption and lower prices. "Not
only that," he said, but yesterday "aluminum, zinc, tin,
nickel and lead prices were also strong. It makes you wonder
if we here in the U.S. are not aware of something that may be
taking place when all these base metals go up together."
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. December delivery
gold rose $3.20 an ounce to $382.40. September silver was up
3.3 cents an ounce at $4.8550. October platinum advanced
$1.30 an ounce to $492.20. Peter Cardillo, director of
commodity research for Jesup, Josephthal Inc., New York, said
renewed tensions between Iraq and Kuwait helped prices to
firm, but the main upward thrust came from strength in the
bond market, "which indicated lower interest rates, which is
favorable for gold." Another analyst observed that the rally
ran into resistance at just over $375 in the August contract,
which ended at $373.30 for a gain of $3.30, and at just over
$385 in the December contract. A third analyst said
inflationary potential from the strong surge in crude oil
prices was a price-firming factor for gold. One reason
current resistance levels are so important in gold, he said,
is that after the Saudi Arabian sales of gold in March, the
market consolidated into a trading range in which the bottom
was about $384 for the December contract. "The December price
has been having difficulty getting above that. But if it
does, we could see further gains of between $10 and $15," he
said.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: A sell-off during the last half of
trading dragged the price of November soybean futures
contracts down 13.5 cents a bushel. Analysts said the selling
was prompted by concerns about the amount of purchases of
grains, including soybeans, by the Soviet Union. In addition,
they said, some investors liquidated positions in soybean
futures as prices fell past preset stopping points, which
exacerbated the sell-off. Argentina, a soybean producing
country with the world's lowest soybean meal prices, reported
lower-than-expected exports to the Soviet Union. "That just
refocused the market's attention on the fact that the Soviets
have been basically absent," said Anne Frick, soybean analyst
for Prudential-Bache Securities. Other grain futures prices
also declined, partly in sympathy with soybeans and partly on
reports of relatively favorable growing conditions.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices fell sharply. The October contract
was off 0.54 cent a pound at 10.55 cents. Liquidation of
contracts has continued to depress prices because demand for
sugar in the world market hasn't been enough to spark a
desire to buy futures contracts and support prices, one
analyst said. China had been expected to buy sugar at around
10.50 cents, "but if she doesn't, who will?" the analyst
asked. Also, the analyst said, traders are expecting a report
from a major sugar trade firm on the 1990-91 sugar crop,
whose season begins Sept. 1. "Some may be expecting the
report to show a relatively small shortfall of production
under consumption or for production to even top usage. This
is in sharp contrast to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
recent preliminary estimate that a significant production
shortfall will take place," the analyst said.

   She Fought the Fascists
   ----

   While much of America slumbered, Dorothy Thompson slugged
it out with the fascists. She was the first journalist
expelled from the Third Reich on Hitler's personal order, and
her steady flow of articles, books, lectures and radio
commentary played no small part in cajoling a complacent and
willfully provincial people into mortal combat with the
Nazis.
   By the time she succumbed to a final heart attack at age
67, Thompson had passed her prime. Succeeding generations
largely forgot her accomplishments as pioneering woman and
path-breaking journalist, the first of the modern pundit
superstars who made both a career and a fortune telling
people what to think. Only a few remembered her as the
inspiration for Katharine Hepburn's title character in "Woman
of the Year," or the first wife of Sinclair Lewis, Nobelist
and drunken maniac. But only now, 29 years after her death,
has her story received the treatment it deserves in the rich
account by Peter Kurth: "American Cassandra: The Life of
Dorothy Thompson" (Little, Brown, 892 pages, $24.95).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The eldest daughter of an itinerant Scottish preacher,
Thompson was born and raised outside Buffalo in "a typical,
very nearly mail-order version of the American small town."
The Thompsons lived on tithes and, when times were hard,
money was scarcer.
   What Rev. Thompson lacked in cash, he compensated for with
his reverence for learning. Dorothy grew up in a world in
which the printed word was sacred, and while attending
Syracuse University she earned a reputation as one of the
most frightening dates imaginable. Apparently, Saturday night
with Doro meant "a walk in the moonlight and a talk about
Hegel." By successive loops of fate, her ambitions as a
writer led her to the Buffalo mailroom of the New York State
Woman Suffrage Party and, eventually, to the campaign stump,
where she agitated and exhorted throughout upstate New York
for the right to vote.
   Eventually, wanderlust sent her aboard a steamer, sharing
quarters with a shipload of Zionists headed to London. Once
there, Dorothy had the moxie to bill herself as an expert on
Palestine to the old International News Service, which then
picked her up as its expert and, ultimately, roving global
correspondent. Women had, after all, always made good spies.
Why not foreign correspondents? And so, Thompson swaggered
through Europe, breaking stories and leaving a trail of
Dorothy legends in her wake.
   She married, as luck would have it, an almost
pathologically insecure pan-European of uncertain origin who
spent his days writing a hopelessly gargantuan sociology
treatise simultaneously in three languages. Joseph, as he
spelled it, (or Josef, as she did), struggled vainly to
complete his magnum opus while Dorothy's career flourished.
The two had affairs, parted ways and divorced, leaving
Dorothy to marry Sinclair Lewis, whose weeklong benders were
legendary in literary circles throughout Europe and America.
   This is Lewis's story almost as much as it is Dorothy's,
for Mr. Kurth draws one of the most memorable, and
horrifying, portraits of the author ever committed to paper.
"He was a man of compulsive neatness and terrifying
perfectionism," writes Mr. Kurth, "an almost prudish decorum
that vanished completely when he drank." Lewis's career hit
one peak in 1930, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize. But as
Dorothy's fame grew, so Sinclair saw himself diminished.
Their marriage produced a child, but it also encouraged
Dorothy to indulge a long-suppressed urge toward
homosexuality.
   By the time Hitler threw Dorothy out of his playpen (der
Fuehrer took exception to the tart remarks in her 1932
fusillade, "I Saw Hitler"), her fame was sealed. Back in the
U.S., Dorothy found a berth at the New York Herald Tribune,
where her thrice-weekly column, "On the Record," played
across the page from the oracular pronouncements of Walter
Lippmann's "Today and Tomorrow." There, as Mr. Kurth lucidly
documents, she busily alienated almost everyone.
   Thompson railed against the New Deal, antagonizing
liberals -- "the oracle of Wall Street," FDR sneeringly
called her. As a classic conservative, she had less patience
for the blind patriotism, which she saw as precursor to
fascism, and the smug isolationism of the day. "Society is
deranged," she once wrote in the Ladies Home Journal. "It is
very sick indeed," dominated "by intellectual giants who are
moral and emotional morons." Her views cost her her berth at
the Tribune, the unofficial journal of establishment
Republicanism, when she abandoned Wendell Wilkie and his
anti-war compatriots for Roosevelt's more militant platform.
   Her column survived for another 18 years, but Thompson's
greatest days were clearly spent sounding the alarms about
impending war and the dangers of Nazi ideology. "The enemy of
fascism is reason," she wrote. "Its enemies are all those
manifestations of the human spirit which derive from profound
personal experience -- art, for instance, and thought."
   Few columnists have been able to devote themselves to a
cause with such integrity and utter, even obsessive,
devotion. Then again, few have found an evil of the
dimensions of Nazism. But in a day of dime-a-dozen pundits
jabbering on the talk shows, Thompson's diligence and
influence are worth recalling. Mr. Kurth's compulsively
readable account allows us to re-live an age and do just
that.

   How `Medical Reviews'
   Are Hurting Hospitals

   Responding to your June 20 article "Hospitals Hire Revenue
Recovery Firms to Inflate Bills, Senate Panel Claims," I
suggest that the Senate panel is investigating the wrong
group. While I would agree that the "revenue recovery" firms
described are among the more unsavory elements involved in
hospital finance, these firms are used, to my knowledge, by
only a very small percentage of hospitals.
   On the other hand, I believe nearly every health insurer
has taken to using the "medical review" excuse as
justification to slow down payments. Any hospital that
refuses to cooperate with an audit by a health insurer is
only defeating itself, since the insurer will not pay the
bill until its audit "process" has been satisfied. Accounts
receivable in hospitals have risen dramatically in the past
few years, and these arbitrary "medical reviews" are a part
of the problem. There is, of course, a cost associated with
the necessary increase in working capital.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I know of no reputable hospital that would refuse to
cooperate with an audit. In some cases it is necessary to
have a clinical professional (R.N., technologist, etc.)
participate in the audit to explain notations in the medical
record. In these cases, it may be appropriate for the insurer
to pay for the professionals' time lost from their scheduled
duties. Without such reimbursement, nearly every patient
account could be subject to groundless examination, all in
the name of preserving cash flow.
   Finally, if the Senate panel involved thinks shutting down
"revenue recovery" firms will add materially to an overall
solution of our health-care-cost crisis, the panel itself is
a part of the problem.

   Judge Rejects Plan
   To Redraw District's

   LOS ANGELES -- Federal Judge David V. Kenyon here rejected
a county plan to redraw supervisoral district lines that he
had earlier found to violate the constitutional rights of the
area's large Hispanic population.
   Judge Kenyon said the plan, supported by three of the
county's five supervisors, was a "nonsensical distortion" of
existing district lines and "not a good-faith effort" to
comply with his earlier order.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After announcing his decision in open court, Judge Kenyon
took a short break and then began hearing alternative
proposals from the Justice Department, the American Civil
Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund.
   "His {ultimate} decision could be one of our plans, or one
he develops himself," said Ramona Ripston, executive director
of the ACLU of Southern California. She expects him to adopt
a plan as soon as tomorrow.
   "We are only a few months away from having results from
the 1990 census," said a spokesman for Supervisor Michael
Antonovich, who favored the county plan. "The redistricting
should be done next year with accurate figures rather than
with 1986 {population} projections."
   Ms. Ripston countered that the county's "intentional
discrimination" has already gone on much too long. "No woman,
black, or Hispanic has been elected to the board" in this
century, she said.
   In June, Judge Kenyon found that the Board of Supervisors
illegally drew boundaries in 1981 to separate the county's
Hispanic community into three separate districts, thus
diluting Hispanic voting strength and maintaining an
all-white governing board. He ordered the county to draw up a
redistricting plan within 20 days. Supervisor Antonovich said
the county would appeal Judge Kenyon's finding.
