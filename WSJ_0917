   Gingrich's Conservative Rhetoric Often
   Conflicts With Role as Representative

   WASHINGTON -- On the political right, no one attacks the
big-spending ways of Washington with greater force than Rep.
Newt Gingrich. "Congress is a sicker and sicker institution
in an imperial capital that wallows in the American people's
tax money," he said in a speech last month.
   But his voting record sometimes as often tells a different
story. When it comes to matters that are important to Mr.
Gingrich's home state of Georgia, such as farm subsidies and
trade protection for textiles, he is quick to shed his image
as Mr. Free Enterprise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In July, Mr. Gingrich voted against an amendment that
would have reduced sugar price supports that cost U.S.
consumers as much as $3 billion a year, by some estimates. He
also recently opposed an amendment that would have denied
crop subsidies to farmers with gross adjusted incomes of more
than $100,000 a year and a second that would have tightened
loopholes that permit widespread avoidance of limits on
farm-income subsidies.
   Mr. Gingrich sometimes even supports farm programs, such
as the sugar program, that don't much benefit Georgia
directly along with a coalition that draws support from other
lawmakers for programs that are helpful to his state.
Textile-state lawmakers long have formed an informal
coalition with farm-state lawmakers, with each side
supporting the other's special legislation.
   Despite his own preference for free markets, Mr. Gingrich
also is a co-sponsor of a textile trade-protection bill that
President Bush has threatened to veto. "Newt and I understand
intellectually that free trade is the way to go," says Sen.
Trent Lott (R., Miss.), who once held Mr. Gingrich's current
position as the No. 2 Republican in the House. But in both
their states, he says, protecting textiles means protecting
jobs.
   "It may be inconsistent," Sen. Lott concedes. "But very
few of us are 100% pure."
   "If you were to try to find a conservative who always
disregards the interests of his constituents," adds Rep.
Mickey Edwards (R., Okla.), "you'd have to look real hard."
   Still, the tightfisted American Taxpayers Union gave Mr.
Gingrich a score of only 46% for last year, which is lower
than the 50% average for all House Republicans. The higher
the score, the less money a congressman voted to spend.
   Mr. Gingrich defends his voting record and his philosophy.
"It's a pragmatic, mixed bag," he says. But then again, he
adds, "I'm a pragmatic free-enterpriser." Referring to a
basic book on free markets, he says, "I'm one of the few
people in Congress who has read Adam Smith's `The Wealth of
Nations,' which is much more pragmatic that the occasional
quotes would indicate."
   He denies that he's part of a coalition of textile and
farm state lawmakers, and says he voted to sustain the sugar
program because "as it's currently run, it's reasonable,"
especially in a market in which sugar is dumped at below cost
by competing nations. The amendment to limit payments to
high-income farmers, he says, was technically unworkable. The
amendment to close loopholes, he adds, was unfit for Midwest
grain farmers; he voted instead for a provision that clamped
down less rigorously.
   Rep. Gingrich acknowledges that his support for the
textile bill is "partly for home state interests." But his
general view is that the U.S. has to be "tougher" as a
negotiator in order to persuade competitors to open their
markets to U.S. goods.
   In fact, Mr. Gingrich's record includes many votes that
are consistent with his rhetoric. Even among the farm-subsidy
battles this year, he voted against one amendment that would
have fattened dairy subsidies, and also supported an
administration-backed plan to lower loan rates for wheat and
feed grains to encourage internationally competitive pricing.
Mr. Gingrich this year also voted for almost all of the
amendments that would have cut appropriations bills.
   Democrats love to take shots at the partisan Mr. Gingrich,
and any disparity between his rhetoric and his voting record
becomes a target. "Nobody minds doing deals, that's part of
the process of governance. But to claim you're above it is a
level of hypocrisy that he has risen to with unerring
frequency," says Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), author of the
anti-sugar subsidy amendment. He refers to Mr. Gingrich's
legislative group, the Conservative Opportunity Society, as
the Photo Opportunity Society.
   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), co-author of the farm
amendment designed to limit payments to rich farmers,
expressed some surprise at Mr. Gingrich's vote against his
proposal. "The vote doesn't square with what I would think
would be his general philosophical beliefs," he says with
some glee. "I guess for Newt, as well as everybody else, all
politics is local."
   But Republicans also know that Mr. Gingrich isn't as
ideological as his rhetoric might imply. "My impression is
that Newt is more conventional than I am with respect to the
question of bringing home the bacon," says Rep. Richard Armey
(R., Texas), co-author of the farm amendment with Rep.
Schumer. "He's always been more of a practical politician
than I."

   The country is focused on David Souter, but it's worth
noting that a Justice Souter will be icing on the
judicial-restraint cake. After three landslide victories by
presidential candidates who ran against judicial activism,
the lower federal courts have already undergone a massive
shift back to judges who are happy to interpret the law and
forgo making it up.
   A recent pair of lower-case opinions neatly contrast the
old style of judging vs. the new:

   The Carter Judge
                                                                                                       

   Do dolphins have standing to sue in court? This wasn't
exactly the way the issue was framed when a San Francisco
group called "Earth Island Institute" sued the Commerce
Department, but it's more than close enough. The group wanted
a judge to ban imports of tuna to help save dolphins, which
get caught in tuna nets. Thelton Henderson, appointed by
President Carter in 1980, complied.
   The environmental group cited the Marine Mammal Protection
Act. The law instructs the Commerce Secretary to act against
countries that exceed their number of dolphin kills. It gives
Commerce the power to ban all fish imports from a country if
it fails to do enough to protect dolphins. Commerce has used
this threat to negotiate huge reductions in the number of
dolphins killed by foreign fleets in the Pacific fishing
areas from California to Chile.
   The problem is that the most recent analysis of dolphins
killed by fishermen from foreign countries has not yet been
done. So we don't know which countries are complying and
which are not. Judge Henderson said that such "practical
considerations or unavailability of information is no
excuse." Instead, he announced that "the continued slaughter
and destruction of these innocent victims of the economics of
fishing constitutes an irreparable injury to us all."
   Judge Henderson, who last year ordered "certified
observers" onto every U.S. tuna boat, gave five countries the
presumption of guilt -- and gave himself the power to act for
the Commerce Secretary. He banned all tuna imports from
Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and Vanuatu. It's a
measure of the overreaching in this case that Commerce has
refused to enforce Judge Henderson's order.
                                                                                                       

   The Reagan Judge
                                                                                                       

   Some day the sort of cases now brought in the name of
dolphins, whales and red squirrels could go the way of an
earlier dodo, antitrust law. Federal judges have spent the
past several years reversing their predecessors by applying
economics to antitrust law.
   The latest judge to take an absurd antitrust case and boot
it out of his courtroom is Frank Bullock of North Carolina,
who like about half the federal judges, was picked by
President Reagan. Judge Bullock, appointed in 1982, sat
through a long trial and watched a jury award nearly $150
million based on wacky legal and economic theories. He
reversed the entire verdict, treble damages and all. This may
finally be the death blow for one of the hoariest theories of
antitrust law, "predatory pricing."
   The Liggett tobacco company accused Brown &amp; Williamson of
predatory pricing in the generic cigarette battles of the
mid-1980s. Liggett said its competitor copied its own
successful marketing program based on volume rebates, but
went too far by selling at too low a price. Judge Bullock
ruled that Liggett failed to prove any harm to consumers. For
one thing, low prices are hardly a burden. For another, Brown
&amp; Williamson had a mere 12% share of the U.S. market, hardly
enough to control the market.
   Judge Bullock reminded everyone that the purpose of the
antitrust laws is not some industrial policy to limit the
success of American firms, but to get consumers the best
products at the lowest prices. "The antitrust laws' goal is
to promote consumer welfare, not to discourage aggressive
price competition," he ruled.
   The Supreme Court can only hear about 150 cases each year,
a tiny fraction of all cases. The good news is that the trend
throughout all levels of federal courts shows that voters are
beginning to get what they wanted, even before Justice
Souter.

   Conferees Agree
   To Tighten Curbs
   On Industrial Smog

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- House-Senate conferees, in their first major
accord on differing clean-air bills, agreed to toughen
controls on industrial sources of smog.
   The Senate conferees largely accepted the stronger
language of the House bill, which would bolster the federal
government's authority to force states and cities to clean up
smog. The Environmental Protection Agency would be required
to impose clean-up plans on cities that failed to come up
with them on their own. The EPA also would impose sanctions
on cities that didn't make good-faith efforts to comply with
their plans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, cities would have more time than under
current law to devise clean-up strategies. Smoggier cities
would be required to take harsher steps than cleaner ones,
including applying controls to smaller polluters such as dry
cleaners and bakeries.
   The conference also reached a compromise on new permit
requirements for major sources of pollution. Again, the
stringency of the regulation would depend on the severity of
an area's air pollution.
   Small-business groups had lobbied vigorously over the
provisions, and the latest accord was reached after conferees
agreed to require states to provide technical assistance for
smaller concerns affected by the bill's requirements.
   Several lawmakers expressed hope that reaching these
agreements would add momentum to what has been a slow-moving
conference process. In the 3 1/2 months since the House and
Senate completed work on their bills, the conferees had
agreed only on provisions designed to phase out the
production of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that
are used in refrigeration and insulation but that harm the
protective stratospheric ozone layer.
   These chemicals generally would be phased out more rapidly
than required under international agreements the U.S. has
signed. The conference plans to take up provisions dealing
with motor vehicles next.

   Adobe Systems Profit
   Exceeds Estimates

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Adobe Systems Inc. reported
higher-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings, but its
stock still slipped.
   For the fiscal third quarter, ended Aug. 31, the software
company reported net income of $10 million, or 45 cents a
share, about 10% higher than the year-earlier $9.1 million,
or 41 cents a share. Revenue jumped 43% to $42.8 million from
$30 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earnings topped average Wall Street estimates of 40 cents
a share. Nonetheless, in national over-the-counter trading
Friday, Adobe tumbled $1.25 to $26.875 on volume of more than
1.3 million shares.
   The results included a special $3 million royalty payment
from a major customer, without which Adobe earnings would
have been a nickel a share or so lower, analysts estimated.
   Bruce Lupatkin, a technology analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist
in San Francisco, said some investors may be concerned that
Adobe is experiencing "margin pressures." He added: "I think
those fears are misplaced. But that is the nature of the
market" for technology stocks, which have been hammered
routinely in recent months at any hint of weakening
operations.
   For the fiscal nine months, Adobe said earnings rose 18%
to $28 million, or $1.28 a share, from $23.7 million, or
$1.08 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 38% to
$115.4 million from $83.7 million.
   Adobe said Apple Computer Inc., its largest customer,
accounted for 21% of total revenue in the latest third
quarter. Earlier this month, the two companies entered into a
"new and expanded" technology agreement, assuaging some
investor fears that the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker was
losing its appetite for Adobe products. Adobe develops and
sells programs that create images and type fonts on desktop
computer screens and printers.

   GM and UAW Continue to Negotiate
   Past Deadline; Strike Pressures Mount

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and the United Auto
Workers union continued contract talks late Sunday evening,
after the union agreed to keep working past a Friday night
strike deadline.
   It was only the second time in its history that the UAW
postponed a walkout after the expiration of a Big Three
contract. In 1987, the union extended its contract with Ford
Motor Co. for three days before reaching agreement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This time, the UAW agreed to keep talking with GM despite
failing to reach agreement by the deadline on its No. 1
issue: job security for its 310,000 active and laid-off GM
members.
   The union said it would continue working under the current
contract on a day-to-day basis. Union leaders told GM members
to report for their regular shifts until further notice. But
both sides clearly hoped to reach a settlement by this
morning.
   "We're inching along," UAW spokesman Frank Joyce said
yesterday afternoon. Top bargaining officials have kept a
tight lid on information about the talks, declining even to
give specific progress reports to local union leaders who are
expected to inform the rank and file. "Information has been
tight," said Robert Roman, an official of the 8,000-member
UAW unit in Flint, Mich., that represents GM's sprawling
Buick City auto complex. "I've never seen it like this in my
25 years of bargaining."
   In any case, pressure is mounting on top UAW bargainers to
reach an agreement that has stronger job security protections
than the current pact, or to spearhead a strike.
   The UAW's national bargaining council -- composed of local
union leaders from around the country -- is scheduled to meet
here this morning to discuss the union's options. If there is
no settlement, union officials could decide to keep talking
without a strike, go ahead with a nationwide walkout, or call
strikes at a few strategic GM plants that produce important
vehicles or parts.
   The UAW's decision to postpone a strike, despite the lack
of agreement on the crucial job-security question,
illustrates the dilemma the union faces as it tries to stop
further job losses at GM.
   In the past, when the UAW controlled virtually all U.S.
auto production, the union didn't hesitate to call for a
walkout if talks dragged on past a strike deadline. But now,
Japanese auto makers have eight U.S. factories -- five of
them non-union -- that would continue pumping out cars and
trucks if UAW members walked out. Ford and Chrysler Corp.
plants also would keep working.
   This glut of car-making capacity in the U.S. means sales
lost during a strike would likely be lost for good,
undermining the very GM jobs the UAW is seeking to protect.
   The job security issue is both complex and critical to the
futures of both the UAW and GM.
   The union wants GM to guarantee jobs, or continued pay,
for all its current UAW workers. UAW leaders have been stung
during the past three years as GM moved to close six U.S.
assembly factories, despite language in the current UAW-GM
agreement that was supposed to forbid permanent plant
shutdowns.
   But GM has been reluctant to extend job guarantees to its
entire current workforce. That's because the No. 1 auto maker
needs to cut as many as 60,000 jobs from its blue-collar
payrolls in North America to match the productivity levels of
its rivals, company officials say.
   Instead of blanket job guarantees, GM is understood to
have offered sweeter pensions to encourage more UAW members
to retire. The company also has pushed for relaxation of
contract language that forces it to replace one of every two
UAW workers who leave. UAW leaders, however, are reluctant to
accept such a package, because it could lead to an exodus of
active members.
   While a strike would make it harder to resolve these
delicate issues, union leaders could come under pressure to
set a firm strike deadline if no deal is struck before
rank-and-file members stream back to GM plants this morning.
   Top UAW officials already are feeling some heat from
below. In response to pressure from dissident members, the
union said it will provide members with a complete copy of
any tentative agreement before a ratification vote. Normally,
the process of getting the contract approved by the
membership takes about two weeks.

   Some People Will Try Anything

   Some anguished home sellers are looking for a miracle,
sort of.
   So don't be alarmed if one dark night you spot your
neighbors digging a hole and burying a statue of St. Joseph.
They're only seeking a little saintly assistance in a buyer's
market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Joanne Walker, a real-estate broker in South Bend, Ind.,
reports that one of her customers got two offers on a house
the first Saturday after burying St. Joseph in the yard. The
customer had been trying to sell for almost a year.
   If the connection between St. Joseph and real estate
leaves non-Catholics scratching their heads, they aren't
alone. Even the church is a bit mystified.
   The Rev. John McSpiritt, who presides over the St. Joseph
Shrine in Stirling, N.J., says he learned of the practice
from members of his former parish in rural Georgia. He hasn't
the slightest idea how it got started. "I call it a `pious
practice,'" he offers. "There's no theology behind it."
   Real-estate agents who have seen St. Joseph go underground
explain that as a carpenter and the husband of Mary, mother
of Jesus, Joseph is the archetypal provider and guardian of
the hearth.
   With no guidelines from the Vatican on how to lay the
saint to rest, conflicting methods have emerged:
   Upside down, facing the house, "in a gracious area -- not
next to the garbage cans," says Ms. Walker. Upside down is
one preference, in the garden is another, says Father
McSpiritt.
   "In some kind of box, to keep something from happening to
him," says Eva Kruse, who sells religious articles at LaSalle
Bookstore in South Bend. "Oh, no, no, no. You can't leave it
in the box," says Maplewood, N.J., broker Joan Dirken.
   One point of agreement: When you sell the house, you dig
him up, dust him off, and display him in a prominent place in
your new home.
   The practice has clearly expanded beyond the devout.
Patrons of a gift shop adjoining the New Jersey shrine have
been carrying off St. Josephs by the armloads, according to
saleswoman Marie Murray, who is selling as many as 100 a
week.
   When Fort Lee, N.J., broker Michael Ignatieff heard about
St. Joseph's powers, he went to a florist specializing in
funerals and picked up a dozen cheap plaster versions to
offer his customers.
   "I'm not even Catholic," he concedes. "It's another
gimmick we're trying. It's another marketing tool."

   The Real Capital-Gains Rate -- 75%

   The U.S. economy cannot long survive the present
capital-gains tax environment. If you purchased a stock
portfolio in 1975 and sold it today, the effective capital
gains tax rate on the transaction would be about 75%. The 28%
tax rate applies both to your real gain, measured in constant
1975 dollars, as well as to the inflation built into the
present price of your portfolio.
   After paying taxes on both the real and inflationary
gains, you are left with only a quarter of your capital gain,
measured in the 1975 dollars with which you bought the
portfolio. The 28% nominal capital-gains rate, in fact, is
the highest in history, as the graph below indicates (see
accompany illustration -- WSJ Sept. 17, 1990). But the real
rate, taking into account past inflation, has risen much
more, to about 75% now from only 23% in 1965. Of course,
different holding periods for the same portfolio involve
different inflation penalties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of the nation's capital stock represents mature
investments made during the 1970s or early 1980s. That is,
risk investors who bought securities or formed businesses in
such growth areas as computers or cable television now hold
mature investments that have the bulk of their capital gains
behind them. Normally, risk investors would sell such
portfolios to income investors and seek new risk investments.
The effective 75% capital-gains rate on an investment held
for 15 years, though, immobilizes their capital, and reduces
the relative price of risk investments. That is why the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, representing the stocks of mature
companies, has outperformed all other indices.
   It is important to view the 1990 stock market in the
context of recent economic history. Between 1954 and 1969,
the rate of increase of stock prices was higher than
inflation, i.e., investors had real capital gains. From 1969
to 1982, when the Reagan tax cuts began to take effect, the
inflation rate exceeded the appreciation of stock prices,
i.e., investors had real capital losses. Between 1982 and
1987, they enjoyed real capital gains once again. Investors
who held out through the bad years now cannot afford to make
their capital liquid. That is, the economy cannot turn the
benefits of the good years into a new generation of
investments.
   These numbers make clear why both a lower basic rate and
inflation indexing of capital-gains taxes are essential.
Indexation is needed to break the logjam of mature
investments, providing an incentive for risk investors to
cash in their capital gains and take new risks.
   High capital-gains tax rates make innovative companies
less attractive to investors, with the result that technology
stocks filled 35% of institutional portfolios in 1989 as
against 47% in 1987. Similarly, venture-capital-backed stock
offerings have disappeared since 1987.
   A lower tax rate on capital gains is required to restore
the attractiveness of new risk investments. The recession in
the Northeast stems from the decline of real estate, high
tech and the securities markets, i.e., the sectors most
sensitive to the high capital gains rate. The deficits at
state capitals and the bill for the S&amp;L bailout would fall
drastically if the capital-gains rate were cut to a tolerable
level.
   But the true significance of a capital-gains tax cut is
not that it would avert recession in the short term --
although it would -- but that it would enable this country to
unbottle the benefits of the Reagan years and mobilize
capital for a new generation of investment.
   Economic growth is the result not of investing "money,"
but effort and skill. At the margin, higher productivity
comes from better skills, that is, technological innovation.
The capital-gains tax as it now stands crushes innovation at
both ends, by destroying the incentive to make new risk
investments while imposing a prohibitive cost on cashing in
mature investments.

   In Budget Talks, Gingrich Plays Outsiders' Game
   While Gramm Is Fast Becoming a Team Player

   WASHINGTON -- When the budget talks began four months ago,
the one certainty seemed to be that veteran tax foes Phil
Gramm and Newt Gingrich would lie down on the tracks to block
any tax increase.
   To listen to conservatives, Rep. Gingrich has delivered
and Sen. Gramm has sold out. Rep. Gingrich is calling for tax
cuts while Sen. Gramm, joining President Bush, has concluded
that raising taxes is the only way to get a pact to reduce
the budget deficit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But behind the closed doors, participants say, the
normally strident Rep. Gingrich is mute and Sen. Gramm has
emerged as the more-effective advocate of cutting
capital-gains taxes and resisting Democratic demands for
higher income-tax rates.
   In short, Rep. Gingrich is still playing the outsiders'
game, even though the stocky, white-haired congressman from
Georgia is now No. 2 in the House Republican leadership. And
Sen. Gramm, a lanky Georgia native who moved to Texas to
teach economics, is fast trading his reputation as a bomb
thrower for one as a pragmatic insider.
   For a time, some conservatives worried that both men had
been co-opted by Mr. Bush and top GOP congressional leaders
when the pair was named to the Republican negotiating team in
an obvious attempt to calm the party's right wing. But last
month, Rep. Gingrich suddenly began calling for tax cuts.
   "Gingrich looks like he may be coming around," says budget
analyst Dan Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank. "He realizes that falling on his
sword for the White House isn't exactly a great thing to do
for his political career. Gramm hasn't said he would support
whatever crummy agreement comes out, but it looks like that
is what he's going to do."
   "I have been . . . radicalized by the summit in watching .
. . the Democrats," Rep. Gingrich said last month in one of
several headline-grabbing speeches that won him applause from
conservative pundits. "They would love to have more tax money
because . . . they have all this political spending they want
to do."
   Sen. Gramm, though quick to condemn what he views as
Democrats' addiction to spending, sees his role differently.
"Do you want to govern or do you want to just protest?"
   Mr. Gingrich says of his colleague: "He's a little more
cooperative than I am. But I am absolutely convinced that if
offered a bad deal, he would walk away from it -- just as I
would walk away from it."
   As the contrast in their approaches became increasingly
evident, Sen. Gramm flew to suburban Atlanta earlier this
month to campaign for Rep. Gingrich's re-election -- and to
say he wouldn't join any attempt to torpedo the talks. Asked
about the trip, Sen. Gramm says only, "I don't kiss and
tell."
   Even though Sen. Gramm has been a persistent advocate
inside the talks for many of their views, conservatives
remain uneasy. Rep. Vin Weber (R., Minn.), a Gingrich
lieutenant in the House, says, "Newt has said that first and
foremost he is advocating the basic positions of the
Republican Party, which is opposition to higher taxes and
support for a lower capital-gains tax, while Phil has decided
he's going to represent the point of view of the
administration," namely to strike a deficit-reduction deal
with the Democrats even if that means higher taxes.
   Sen. Gramm responds that it is "wishful thinking" to say
that higher taxes can be avoided. "If I had the freedom to
write the package myself, it wouldn't have revenues. But I
didn't get to choose the members of the summit and I didn't
get to choose the members of the House and Senate."
   Although the two men share political philosophies, Rep.
Gingrich broke with President Reagan in 1982 and voted
against a tax increase while then-Rep. Gramm, at the time a
Democrat, voted for it. Their paths have diverged again this
year, a reflection of differing personal ambitions as well as
the peculiarities of the House and Senate.
   Rep. Gingrich figures that only through confrontation can
the frustrated Republican minority unseat the Democratic
liberals who have dominated the House for 36 years. His dream
is to lead Republicans to power under the banner of tax cuts
-- but that looks like a dream deferred by Mr. Bush's
repudiation of his no-new-taxes promise.
   In the past few months, Rep. Gingrich has been tripped up
by conflicts between his roles as tax foe and budget
negotiator. In May, he declared in a fund-raising letter: "I
strongly believe that increasing taxes on working people will
NOT solve our country's massive budget problems]" In July, he
joined other House Republicans in vowing opposition to tax
increases of any kind. But later that month, witnesses say,
he told Democrats at the closed-door budget summit: "I'm
prepared to sponsor and support raising taxes," a statement
that quickly spread through the Capitol. Embarrassed, he
explained on the House floor the next morning that he would
support higher taxes -- but only after Democrats agreed to
cut spending.
   Then late last month, Rep. Gingrich did another
about-face. With the economy weakening and the administration
unwilling to abandon the budget summit as he had hoped, he
began calling for billions of dollars in tax cuts to revive
economic growth.
   "He changes his position {on taxes} more often than most
people change socks," charges his Democratic challenger in
his fall re-election contest, attorney David Worley.
   Lately, Rep. Gingrich has been pressing his views on
fellow Republican negotiators, occasionally jousting with
White House Budget Director Richard Darman. But he has said
little at negotiating sessions with the Democrats.
   "Why fight every day in a room that's stacked against
you?" says Rep. Weber. "In the end, they are going to have to
go to Newt to sign off on the deal, or decide they're going
to go around the House Republicans."
   Mr. Gingrich, acknowledging his unpopularity among those
at the summit table, says of himself, "It's not all that
effective for Newt to push something."
   In contrast to the fiercely partisan Rep. Gingrich, Sen.
Gramm has grown accustomed to working with Democrats in the
Senate, where Republicans have more influence because of
their numbers.
   And while Rep. Gingrich draws his strength from
conservatives, Sen. Gramm is said to be cultivating moderate
Republicans. For now, he wants to be elected chairman of the
GOP Senate campaign fund-raising committee, but his ultimate
goal is to succeed George Bush in 1996.
   At the budget talks, even Democrats have been impressed by
Sen. Gramm's forceful yet conciliatory arguments. One liberal
confides that he finds himself agreeing more often with Sen.
Gramm than with any other negotiator.
   The transition to team player began last year when Sen.
Gramm won assignment to the Budget Committee, from which
Senate GOP leaders had previously blocked him, and to the
coveted Appropriations Committee. In that insider's world,
where party labels blur amid the trading, he has cooperated
to win funding for home-state projects.
   Some critics suggest that Sen. Gramm is siding with Mr.
Bush in part because the president reappointed his wife,
Wendy, as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission even though she has sparred repeatedly with
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   But a more-immediate motive may be the prospect of massive
across-the-board spending cuts if the budget talks fail. The
cuts would literally bear Sen. Gramm's name: They are
mandated under the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law
that the Texan co-sponsored.
   "He naturally would be disinclined to see that one bad
thing that has his fingerprints on it happen," says a fellow
Texas GOP conservative, Rep. Dick Armey. "So I'm sure that
makes him more willing to consider alternatives."

   Gasoline Exports Rise Despite Concern Over Supplies

   Even as experts fret over the adequacy of future U.S.
petroleum supplies, the domestic oil industry has quietly
stepped up exports of gasoline.
   If the outflow continues, it could mean continued high
pump prices for U.S. motorists and tight supplies at the
wholesale level in the months ahead. That, in turn, could
create public-policy headaches for the government, which is
asking motorists to conserve gasoline, and for the oil
industry, already accused of price gouging in the current
crisis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since the start of the Iraq-Kuwait oil embargo in early
August, shipments of gasoline out of the country -- mostly to
Europe -- have doubled or tripled from their skimpy rates of
recent years, according to numerous people familiar with or
involved in oil trading.
   There is nothing illegal or improper about such sales --
oil is one of the most widely traded world commodities. But
they do represent a "very, very significant abnormality from
trends of recent years," says Calvin Kent, head of the Energy
Department's Energy Information Administration.
   Gasoline is routinely imported into some major U.S.
markets because domestic refineries can't always satisfy
demand. And the small amounts of fuel exported usually go to
nearby countries for logistical reasons, although some
regularly goes to Japan.
   But now profit opportunities overseas have zoomed, with
European buyers offering $4 to $8 -- and at one point in
excess of $10 -- more per barrel for gasoline than the U.S.
market. A $4-per-barrel differential means $1 million of
additional profit on a typical tanker-load. As a result, one
oil company official says his company feels "considerable
pressure" to export. Like many oil industry people, he
wouldn't discuss exports unless given anonymity.
   No one knows yet exactly how much more U.S. gasoline is
going overseas in the wake of the Middle East crisis.
Government data on tanker exports lag behind by several
months because of an antiquated, century-old tracking system.
But industry people who attempt to measure such activities on
their own put the figure at 10 to 20 cargoes since early
August. "It's not an armada, but it has become a trend," says
Peter Gignoux, who heads the international trading desk for
Shearson Lehman Hutton in London.
   Philip Verleger, senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics and a Treasury Department official
under President Carter, told a gathering of 35 congressmen
Thursday that exports "could be as much as 100,000 to 150,000
barrels a day for August" and early September.
   Such estimates suggest between 4.5 million and 6.75
million barrels of exports in the past 45 days. When compared
with government statistics, that would equal more than 30% of
all the gasoline exported for the full year of 1989. Gasoline
exports last year, according to the Energy Department's Mr.
Kent, averaged 39,000 barrels daily, with no more than 60,000
barrels a day exported in any one month.
   The increase in exports, coupled with a modest decline in
imports in recent weeks, could mean lean gasoline supplies in
the U.S. later this year unless demand falls significantly,
some industry and government analysts think. While demand is
off a bit now because of the softer economy, and inventories
have risen slightly in recent days, supplies still aren't
bountiful. As a result, the seasonal slump in retail pump
prices that normally follows the end of the summer driving
season may not occur this year, analysts say.
   In fact, motorists may even have to pay still more. "We're
struggling just to maintain our gasoline inventories now,"
says Ted Eck, chief economist for Amoco Corp. Adds Sarah
Emerson, analyst for Energy Security Analysis Inc.: "As long
as U.S. gasoline goes to Europe, supplies of that fuel will
remain tight."
   Mr. Kent of the Energy Department says he is haunted by a
sense of deja vu. "The situation bears watching," he says.
"Last year, good bits of propane were diverted to Europe
because prices were higher there. And when the weather turned
cold here, the U.S. was short that fuel."
   So far this year, gasoline demand in Europe has been
running 3.5% ahead of last year because of robust economies
and increased motor travel caused by the opening of Eastern
Europe. At the same time, European refiners are being
squeezed by the loss of large amounts of partially refined
Kuwaiti oil that was easily turned into gasoline. In part,
they are substituting some Saudi crudes that yield less
gasoline per barrel.
   So wholesale prices are much higher than in the U.S. On
some recent days, gasoline there fetched 10 cents to 20 cents
a gallon more than in the U.S; on one day, the gap was 32
cents.
   The full list of refiners taking advantage of such spreads
can't be determined. However, people involved with trading
identify at least five involved in recent transactions:
Phibro Energy, a unit of Salomon Inc.; BP North America Inc.,
a unit of the United Kingdom's British Petroleum Co.; Texaco
Inc.; Citgo Petroleum Corp., wholly owned by Venezuela, and
Kansas-based Koch Industries Inc.
   In response to questions, Phibro says only that it does
from "time to time export an odd cargo" of gasoline. It is
understood, however, that Phibro currently has a cargo going
to South America; it hasn't sent anything to Europe since
hostilities in the Persian Gulf began. BP confirms that it
has put together at least one cargo for Europe and that its
European arm is taking into its own system any exports that
it purchases. BP is also taking in U.S. gasoline in New
Zealand.
   Citgo says it has sent one cargo to Europe so far --
230,000 barrels of super premium unleaded. A Koch official
says that company sold one cargo to BP North America, but
says he doesn't know how BP used it. He also says Koch has
made sales to U.S. companies with refineries overseas, but
doesn't know what happened to the fuel after that. Texaco
confirms it sent one cargo of gasoline to supply customers of
its Pembroke refinery in Wales, which is down for
maintenance. It says the shipment doesn't reflect a
continuing program.
   While there is nothing wrong with such transactions, the
timing couldn't be worse for the oil industry. The Justice
Department is already investigating the sharp rise in
gasoline prices since the invasion of Kuwait. Now other
federal agencies are chasing information on exports,
including the Energy Department and, industry advisers say,
the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Most high-ranking oil officials are reluctant to discuss
the topic. "No doubt, it's an embarrassment," concedes one.
Adds another executive at a large U.S. oil company: "No
refiner in his right mind should export product right now.
Just one barrel, just one rowboat full -- the heat we'd take
from the feds would be immense."
   Those willing to defend exporting say it is merely the
free market at work. "We aren't taking gasoline from
Americans for the net benefit of the rest of the world,"
insists an official of a company making exports. "Demand for
gasoline is simply stronger in Europe than it has been here."
   Tom Burns, manager of economics for Chevron Corp., says:
"The market is allocating the gasoline to those who value it
most highly. This shouldn't be looked at in a moralistic way.
And if it is, well, we're just exporting to our allies who
need it." Mr. Burns says Chevron isn't exporting.
   The government could face an equally awkward
public-relations dilemma. Among the questions pondered at
last Thursday's closed-door congressional meeting was what
the public might think about oil being exported for profit
"while American husbands and sons go to the Saudi desert to
fight," says one attendee. Also, the government is in the
midst of kicking off a campaign calling on American motorists
to cut back on gasoline consumption.
   Some industry experts contend a schizophrenic U.S. energy
policy has inadvertently encouraged exports by creating a
two-tier global oil pricing system in which the U.S. trails.
The administration preaches the free market, even as it
imposes a subtle form of oil price control by having
officials call industry executives to urge restraint.
   And as the government struggles to set strategy, it
doesn't always take into account anomalies that can arise
within the market. For instance, analysts say, not all
oil-fed utilities and manufacturing plants in the U.S. should
be encouraged to stop using residual fuel oil in favor of
natural gas. If too much of that heavy fuel oil is shunned,
they argue, oil refineries will have to cut back on runs of
gasoline and heating oil. That is because they would be
swamped with unsold "resid" that is automatically produced at
the same time.
   "The government -- it just doesn't know how to connect the
dots," says Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation.

   An affiliate of First Gibraltar Bank FSB, the Texas thrift
formed almost two years ago as part of the controversial
Southwest Plan, acquired Oklahoma's largest thrift, Sooner
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Tulsa, and its $1.1
billion in deposits.
   The sale of Sooner Federal was announced Friday just hours
after the House Banking Committee heard testimony that the
government's costs under the 1988 Southwest Plan, including
the one that created First Gibraltar, are expected to reach
$54 billion, well above the original estimate of $39 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As much as $10 billion of those costs, including $1.8
billion in tax benefits, are part of the 10-year assistance
package that accompanied the First Gibraltar deal in December
1988. The thrift was formed with the acquisition of five
failed Texas thrifts by MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Group Holdings
Inc., an investment group led by Revlon Inc. chairman Ronald
O. Perelman, and Ford Bank Group of Dallas.
   Because of an ongoing review by the Resolution Trust
Corp., the federal thrift bailout agency, First Gibraltar
wasn't allowed to acquire Sooner Federal outright. Rather, it
used an affiliate thrift formed last March with the purchase
of San Antonio Savings Association, a $2.2 billion thrift.
   In March, the RTC reversed its previous policy barring
sales of thrifts to federally assisted institutions, allowing
First Gibraltar to acquire San Antonio Savings. The San
Antonio thrift must be separately capitalized until the RTC
review is completed.
   First Gibraltar San Antonio is acquiring all of the
deposits and 27 branches of Sooner Federal, which was placed
in RTC conservatorship last November. First Gibraltar is
paying $5.1 million for Sooner's deposits but isn't injecting
any capital into the thrift, according to First Gibraltar
Chairman Gerald Ford.
   First Gibraltar is also acquiring $891.1 million of Sooner
Federal's assets, including cash, securities and $425.4
million in residential mortgage loans, but has 18 months to
return unwanted assets to the RTC.
   The RTC is retaining $351.3 million in assets and
providing an initial outlay of about $155.7 million in cash
to First Gibraltar San Antonio. The agency estimates the
final cost of the deal at $148.7 million, based on expected
sales of assets.
   First Gibraltar's bid for Sooner Federal was chosen over a
dozen other proposals submitted by seven banks, including
Fourth Financial Corp. of Wichita, Kan.
   The acquisition marks the first time in recent history
that a Texas thrift has expanded its franchise outside the
Lone Star state. But at least one thrift consultant, William
Ferguson of Dallas, questioned the wisdom of the border
crossing, citing Oklahoma's "dismal business climate."
   "I just don't see that much opportunity for lending in the
Southwest," Mr. Ferguson said, adding that the acquisition
does give First Gibraltar "a pretty good source for
reasonably low-cost deposits" to counter stiff competition in
Texas from NCNB Corp. and Banc One Corp.
   Banc One's Texas unit on Friday acquired $250 million in
deposits from Capitol City Federal Savings Association of
Austin. Bank One Texas also acquired $156.2 million of the
thrift's $374.6 million in assets.
   In other RTC actions on Friday:
   First Network Federal Savings Bank of Los Angeles, with
$515 million in assets, was closed, and insured depositors
will be paid off. Deposits totaled about $373.9 million.
   City Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Birmingham,
Ala., was acquired by First Alabama Bancshares Inc. of
Montgomery, Ala. First Alabama acquired all of the thrift's
$497.1 million in deposits and $187 million of its $449.3
million in assets.
   Meritbanc Savings Association of Houston and its $307.7
million in deposits were acquired by Kilgore Federal Savings
&amp; Loan Association of Kilgore, Texas. Kilgore also purchased
$71.2 million of Meritbanc's $195.2 million in assets.
   Deposits at French Market Homestead FSA of Metairie, La.,
were transferred to First National Bank of Commerce in New
Orleans. The thrift had $192.6 million in assets and $219.9
million in deposits.

   Environmentalism Gone Amok

   If you're like me, you're glad that environmentalism has
become chic. All those gala champagne soirees for the
protection of the rain forest have definitely raised my
consciousness. But who'd have guessed that ecology would
suddenly get so hot they'd inflict it on us as a weekly
dramatic action series?
   "What in hell are we doing here?]" shouts a voice over an
image of the globe. Cut to a man on top of a factory
smokestack, screaming through a megaphone, "We're murdering
the planet] We're poisoning the atmosphere] We're killing the
skies] . . . It's got to stop]]" Then he unfurls a banner
that proclaims "Recycle" and flings himself off the
smokestack.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So begins "E.A.R.T.H. Force" (CBS, Saturdays, 9 p.m. EDT),
a show whose heart is certainly in the right place, but whose
mind is somewhere else altogether. Here's the basic premise:
A fiendish villain infiltrates a nuclear plant to steal
plutonium, and sabotages the cooling system. Meltdown is 36
hours away. The rich industrialist who owns the plant decides
to assemble a crack squad of scientists, doctors and
pollution experts to combat the threat (the first of many
adventures). Sound familiar? Like an environmental A-Team,
perhaps? Just think of this show as "Mission: Recyclable."
   If there's any fundamental improbability to calmly pulling
together a crisis-containment group from all over the globe
just hours before nuclear disaster, you wouldn't know it from
this show. And once all the members are assembled, with the
clock ticking toward ecological catastrophe, what do they do?
Sit down for an elegant, leisurely dinner, of course. Makes
sense to me. Then the team rushes to the site and, with
seconds left, saves the day.
   But wait] The danger isn't over yet. There's still a whole
second hour needed to track down the villain and wrest the
plutonium from his evil hands.
   Since "E.A.R.T.H. Force" lacks the clever, intricate
plotting of a "Mission: Impossible," at least you could hope
for some of the quirky characters of an "A-Team." Instead,
writers and executive producers Richard Chapman and Bill Dial
offer up a bunch of self-righteous do-gooders, certainly one
of the most sanctimonious, humorless groups ever assembled on
the small screen: a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a marine
biologist and an anthropologist.
   This Clean Team is given to railing at everyone in sight.
As they face assorted menaces over the coming weeks, their
deadliest weapon is sure to be their loquacity: "Maybe he
discovered something more important, more important than man
and his ambition, or his need to control the world around
him, to play with it like a spoiled child tinkers with his
toy, until it breaks and he throws it away. {The music
swells.} We've lived on this planet for 50,000 years, and in
the last 200, we've damn near killed it."
   Finding himself behind bars, the physicist naturally
starts castigating his fellow jailbirds for throwing
Styrofoam cups on the floor of the prison: "This is our
environment here," he scolds. "The Parthenon is in ruins;
plastic is forever." And when team members argue with each
other, their insults are lines like: "I've got two Ph.D.s and
an honorary degree from Oxford."
   So when, at the end of this premiere, the team looks
somberly at the camera and announces, "It's a big world out
there, and most of it's asleep. What the hell -- maybe we can
wake it up," you know most of the audience will be snoozing.
   Frankly, an issue as important as the destruction of the
planet deserves a better show. I'm all for attacking
pollution, but what about pollution of the airwaves? Save the
planet? They should have saved their breath.
   ---
   This week marks the official beginning of the 1990-91
television season, and luckily there are at least a couple of
shows with some potential. Two action dramas rooted solidly
in character are "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" (CBS, Mondays,
10 p.m. EDT) and "Gabriel's Fire" (ABC, Thursdays, 9 p.m.
EDT).
   "Trials" teams up two "Cagney and Lacey" alums, producer
Barney Rosenzweig and actress Sharon Gless. At first, this
show may appear to be a cut-rate "L.A. Law," with Ms. Gless
as a public defender, wheeling and dealing with the
prosecutor in the courthouse bathroom. But quickly it becomes
clear that Mr. Rosenzweig's plan is to vamp in the vein of
"The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," to focus not solely on
Rosie O'Neill, lawyer, but Rosie O'Neill, newly divorced
43-year-old, private-school-educated child of privilege who
gave up her corporate practice when her marriage collapsed.
Now she works in the P.D.'s office, but parks her Mercedes
five blocks from the office because she feels guilty about
owning it.
   So far, "Trials" is a full-blooded portrait of a feisty,
hard-charging woman, full of convictions and full of doubts.
She's got a black office mate who isn't thrilled to see her
(he thinks she's slumming) and a mother who can't understand
her choice: "This isn't law; it's street cleaning. You
graduated fifth in your class in law school so you could work
for the sanitation department?"
   So Rosie sits in the dark at her house, eating ice cream
and worrying: "Does my neck look crepey? . . . I wonder when
he decided he didn't love me anymore . . ." But she also has
a nice acerbic edge too, especially when talking about the
woman her husband left her for: "How is Bridget? What is she,
12 now?"
   Although Ms. Gless occasionally wanders over the top as
Rosie, she's creating a good, strong character. For the fans
of Cagney, this should be a treat.
   ---
   Another treat -- a positive joy -- is that James Earl
Jones has finally emerged from under that Darth Vader helmet,
and made it to the small screen in "Gabriel's Fire." As
Gabriel Bird, an ex-con tasting freedom for the first time in
20 years, Mr. Jones was wonderful in the pilot last week, by
turns phlegmatic, confused, exultant. So far, the plotting of
the show looks fairly standard-issue, with Gabriel working
for a female yuppie lawyer as her detective in the coming
episodes, but Mr. Jones positively fills the screen with his
towering voice, his monumental presence. This is clearly the
best acting of the season. Yes, "E.A.R.T.H. Force," the vast
wasteland can be reclaimed . . . More in future columns.

   Boeing Makes
   Public Its Plan
   To Cut Crashes

   It's a matter of simple mathematics, and Boeing Co. is
worried.
   The sheer number of airline flights is increasing faster
than the rate of airliner accidents is decreasing. If that
trend continues, says the world's top builder of passenger
jets, the net effect would be an average of 20 major crashes
a year for all makes of airliners by the middle of the next
decade, up from 15 now.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's "hitting critical mass" in terms of negative
publicity, Boeing says, so it has set out to do everything it
can to reduce the number of crashes before travelers are
scared out of their wits. "We're heavily dependent on public
confidence," says Earl Weener, the engineer in charge of
safety at the Seattle giant. "And clearly, the public would
like us to have no accidents."
   Perfection is impossible. But Mr. Weener maintains that by
studying the roughly 850 large-scale plane wrecks that have
occurred since the jet age began in the late 1950s, Boeing
has come up with a plan to reduce significantly the number of
airliner accidents and fatalities.
   Boeing already has started going public with its findings,
sharing them with the rest of the industry, the media and
lawmakers. In all of these forums, Boeing has insisted that
the means to make flying safer are already available. "We
don't need a lot of new, sexy technology," Mr. Weener says.
Instead, carriers and airports around the globe need to make
investments in safety-enhancing equipment, and airlines need
to train their pilots better, Boeing suggests.
   At the same time, Boeing isn't discounting the importance
of correcting its own design deficiencies or assembly-line
miscues, when they arise. "We're not saying it's all the
fault" of airports and pilots, Mr. Weener insists. But he
notes that when there's an identifiable manufacturing problem
that leads to a crash, the Federal Aviation Administration is
mandated to step in and it tends to be fixed relatively
quickly. The problems that Boeing is pointing out, by
contrast, have seemed to sit and fester. "Some of what is
causing accidents is absolutely too predictable," Mr. Weener
says.
   Although some in the aviation industry are skeptical that
Boeing's plan will make much of a difference, the reaction to
Boeing's open airing of its concerns has been surprisingly
positive. Even the Air Line Pilots Association has been
supportive. While the union is uneasy with Boeing's
calculations that mistakes by flight crews have caused more
than 72% of the accidents during the past 10 years, the union
praises the company for digging behind the raw statistics, a
compilation of U.S. and foreign government investigative
reports.
   "Even though it grates on us to hear `pilot error,' we do
know that what Boeing is doing is right and proper," says
John O'Brien, the union's director of engineering and air
safety.
   One tactic in Boeing's plan is to encourage airports
around the world to put in electronic instrument-landing
systems, beams that help guide a plane on its glide path
downward. Looking at its own 737 narrow-body twin-jet, Boeing
says that of 83 major accidents that have occurred since the
plane was introduced in the late 1960s, 40 were during
approach and landing. Many of these could have been averted,
Mr. Weener says, if airport facilities had been using the
gear Boeing is calling for. The system, which has already
been installed at most major U.S. airports, costs about $1
million a runway.
   Another tactic that Boeing recommends is the use of
flight-data recorders to review regularly the performance of
aircraft and their flight crews. Although many foreign
carriers use such a setup, U.S. airlines have been inclined
to check such a wide range of information only after a crash,
when the "black box" is recovered.
   But now, largely because of Boeing's efforts, domestic
airlines are considering adding to their planes new
sophisticated recorders that can spot troubling patterns
before any damage is done. For instance, a recorder could
alert regulators to the fact that planes landing at a certain
airport are repeatedly descending too rapidly.
   "It's our hope that we're going to see in the coming
months one or more of the large carriers decide to go into it
in a big way," says Anthony Broderick, the FAA's chief of
regulation and certification. Mr. Weener says the key is for
airlines to use the recorders strictly to foster safety, not
as tools against pilots who may have gone astray.
   The biggest lifesaver, though, could turn out to be a
device that already exists on domestic airliners, but that
has often malfunctioned or been misused. Since 1975, pilots
around the world have unwittingly run aircraft into the
ground 66 times without mechanical failures, bad weather or
air-traffic controller foul-ups. In 44 of those cases, Boeing
says, the planes either didn't have a ground-proximity
warning system or had a faulty one. The system is supposed to
sound an alarm -- "Pull up] Pull up]" it shrieks -- when an
airliner not configured for landing has strayed too close to
the terrain.
   Although the device costs only about $30,000 an aircraft
to install -- a minimal expense considering that a wide-body
jet can go for more than $125 million these days -- it's
estimated that two-thirds of all non-U.S. carriers, or about
460 airlines, don't use such systems in their fleets. Even in
the U.S., where Congress has mandated the use of
ground-proximity indicators, Boeing has found that pilots
often ignore the signal; that's exactly what happened in five
of six crashes of this type last year, it says.
   Part of the reason is that early-generation warning
systems had a tendency to go off inadvertently, which has
conditioned some cockpit crews to assume a high number of
false alarms. "A lot of pilots just turn them off," says Mr.
Weener.
   The solution, he says, is for carriers to make sure they
are using the latest systems, which are much less likely to
be triggered arbitrarily and give a pilot an extra long time
to respond. In addition, Boeing believes that airlines must
teach pilots to take the plane higher immediately, if they
can, and to ask questions later, even if a flight is delayed
as a result.
   Not everyone in the industry is convinced that Boeing's
proposals will really do that much good. "Anytime you have
somebody with Boeing's credibility pounding the drum, it's
certain to help," says Rick Davis, director of an aviation
safety program at the University of Southern California. But,
he adds, "getting things done is not always so easy," because
certain airlines will by nature be slow to make changes, and
those in weaker financial condition may not be able to afford
even the slightest safety improvements.
   Ken Plunkett, director of research at the Aviation Safety
Institute, a Worthington, Ohio, watchdog organization, also
points out that some mistakes by pilots are inevitable.
"Maybe we're trying to push human beings beyond" what they're
able to do, he suggests.
   Nonetheless, Boeing feels that by stirring discussion, it
can -- and will -- make things better. "Traditionally, we
haven't wanted to point the finger," explains Randy
Harrision, the Boeing public relations man on the campaign.
"But it's gotten to the point that if we can't influence
events, it's going to become untenable for everybody."
   Boeing may be pointing the finger, but it isn't naming
names, even at meetings attended exclusively by aviation
industry officials. Instead of singling out the carriers with
lousy records, it's calling attention to exemplary airlines,
such as British Airways and Pan American World Airways, when
it comes to the proper use of ground-proximity warning
systems.
   "I have not heard anything that would cause us to have
concern" with Boeing's approach, says William W. Hoover,
executive vice president for operations and safety at the Air
Transport Association of America, the carriers' trade group.
   In the end, what could have become a nasty display of
bickering and backbiting is quietly emerging into an unusual
show of cooperation and mutual support. "I think more and
more, the industry is realizing what the full cost of an
accident is," says John Enders, president of the Flight
Safety Foundation, a nonprofit Washington group that is
working with all the players to help smooth over the rough
spots.

   U.S. Clears Tokos
   To Market Monitor
   For Uterine Activity

   SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Tokos Medical Corp., a provider of
specialized home health care, said it received Food and Drug
Administration approval to market a home uterine-activity
monitor made by the company's recently acquired Physiologic
Diagnostic Service unit.
   The Genesis system monitor is the first to gain commercial
approval for home treatment of pregnant women who are at risk
for pre-term labor, Tokos said. The sooner pre-term labor is
diagnosed and treated, the better the chances for delivery of
a healthy baby.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such monitors made by Physiologic Diagnostic Service,
Tokos and others have been used by tens of thousands of women
since the mid-1980s, but some doctors have been reluctant to
prescribe them and some health insurers have denied coverage,
because the monitors lacked FDA approval for home use.
   "Nobody knows how quickly the medical community will
react, but this is very significant news," said John F.
Hindelong, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp.
   Mr. Hindelong expects Tokos's revenue to jump more than
50% next year to between $110 million and $115 million from
an estimated $70 million this year, largely because of the
FDA approval. Pretax margins will surge to 19% next year from
6% in 1990, he calculates. Last year, Tokos earned $616,000,
or six cents a share, on revenue of $58.9 million.
   In May 1988, an FDA panel recommended against approval of
Tokos's Term Guard monitor, which is similar to the Genesis
system. The panel said that Tokos's research data were
insufficient to demonstrate the monitor's effectiveness apart
from Tokos's perinatal nursing care for patients.
   Physiologic Diagnostic Service, acquired by Tokos earlier
this month, designed its research studies to focus on the
device alone, said Craig T. Davenport, Tokos president and
chief operating officer. Tokos plans to pursue FDA approval
for the Term Guard monitor, which is somewhat more portable
than the Genesis system, Mr. Davenport said.
   Tokos shares closed at $12, up 50 cents, in national
over-the-counter trading Friday.

   WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department said any sugar
imported into the U.S. beyond a nationwide total of 1,725,000
metric tons will be subject to higher tariffs during the year
starting Oct. 1.
   At the same time, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
announced how much sugar each country could send here at the
current, relatively low tariff rate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The twin announcements put into effect a new system of
sugar import restrictions. The U.S. is substituting higher
tariffs for strict numerical quotas. The change was prompted
by an international trade panel ruling last year that the old
system of import quotas violated the rules of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   U.S. trade-policy officials said the higher duties on
imports exceeding 1,725,000 metric tons effectively would
hold imports to that level. That would be up about 6.5% from
the level of imports allowed under the old quota system for
the year ending Sept. 30.
   The tariff on imports exceeding 1,725,000 will be 16 cents
per pound. Imports up to that annual limit will be subject to
the current duty of 0.625 cents per pound. In addition,
imports that come from a large group of developing nations
eligible for special tariff preferences under U.S. trade laws
will continue to be duty-free.
   The country-by-country allocations of sugar import quotas
by Mrs. Hills were based on the historical pattern of U.S.
sugar imports and were computed on the same basis as previous
quota allocations.
   As in the past, countries with the largest allocations
were the Dominican Republic (292,010 metric tons), the
Philippines (262,147 tons), and Brazil (240,578 tons).
   U.S. officials said the change to the so-called
tariff-rate quota system for sugar imports probably will have
little effect on domestic sugar prices, which are about 23
cents per pound, compared with world market prices of about
11 cents per pound.

   Irish Luck Out

   South Bend, Ind. -- The U. of Notre Dame opened its 1990
football campaign here Saturday night, and not a moment too
soon. An off-season of even a few hours more might have
necessitated a truely massive order of tarnish remover for
use on the school's famous Golden Dome.
   Hardly had the echoes gone back to sleep after a typical,
August-to-January, 12-win Irish season when college
football's most relentlessly hyped "good guys" aggregation
announced it had bolted the television package of the College
Football Association, which it helped found, to sign with NBC
a $38 million deal for its home games for five years,
starting next year. About the nicest thing the Irish were
called was greedy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Then one ex-player sued the school and the NCAA to get
back the eligibility they removed after he entered (without
success) the last NFL draft, and another said that Irish
linemen used steroids with the tacit approval of Coach Lou
Holtz. And then Barry Switzer, who oughta know about such
things because he used to coach at Oklahoma, said ND broke
the rules by getting a summer job for a prized recruit.
   But Notre Dame is no more easily upset off the gridiron
than on. Holtz, who knows about a lot of things, said he
didn't know nuttin' about no steroids or summer jobs, and
Irish eyes merely smiled at the expectation of the TV riches
to come. The once and future champs of the bottom line would
televise, televise, televise, recruit, recruit, recruit, and
win, win, win.
   And, if the truth be known, entertain, entertain,
entertain, which the Irish did for everyone but foe Michigan
during Saturday's late show. In a game that had more twists
than a sack of pretzels, Notre Dame came back from a 24-14
deficit to prevail, 28-24. Among the ingredients of the
victory were a first-play fumble by a Michigan back who
didn't expect to have the ball, an opportune end zone pass
interception and a tipped-ball pass catch that kept a key ND
drive alive.
   "I don't know yet how we won -- the luck of the Irish and
the Lady on the Dome must have had something to do with it,"
said a relieved Holtz later.
   "When we needed something to happen, it usually did,"
testified Rick Mirer, the freckle-faced, 6-foot-3 sophomore
quarterback from nearby Goshen, Ind., making his first start
for the school. He catches on quick to how things work around
here.
   How they work is that Notre Dame usually gets the best of
it in this world and -- who knows? -- maybe any others. The
latest Irish edition showed up in its crowded home stadium
ranked No. 1 in the polls -- it's normal position -- even
though it had yet to play a game. Michigan, also debuting,
came in ranked No. 4. If actual performance makes an
impression on the people who vote in those affairs, the two
teams should enter next weekend ranked Nos. 1 and 1 1/2,
respectively, `cause the Wolverines won the first 58 minutes
of this contest.
   "Coming into the game we felt we were going to win, and
right up to the end we thought we could do it," said Gary
Moeller, the Michigan mentor. "It didn't quite work out on
the scoreboard, though."
   Saturday was Moeller's first look at Irish magic from a
head coach's perspective, this being his first year in the
post. He took over from his longtime boss, Bo Schembechler,
one of whose last gridiron acts was to fling his clipboard
turfward at the Rose Bowl when an official's call went
against his boys. Moeller had a previous head-coaching job,
at Illinois, a dozen years ago, and while he won but six
games in three years he at least showed Bo's flair for
quarreling with representatives of the news media. He behaved
himself Saturday, but give the guy a chance.
   Schembechler's main contribution to the football art was
his invention of, first, the 260-pound offensive lineman,
and, later, 280-, 300- and 320-pound varieties of the same
species. That he left Mo amply supplied in this department is
witnessed by Michigan's current OL, which averages 290
pounds.
   Alas for the Wolverines, those fellas didn't have much
chance to do their stuff in the early going while the Irish
sprinted to a 14-3 lead. The initial Notre Dame touchdown
followed a fumble by Michigan tailback Jon Vaughn on the
first play from scrimmage after a communications mixup
between quarterback and bench. After a Michigan field goal,
the Irish tallied again on an 11-play, 75-yard drive capped
by a two-yard Tony Brooks dive.
   But then the low-slung Vaughn commenced to scoot, and tall
quarterback Elvis Grbac to pass, behind their heifer-sized
blockers, and the next three TDs were Michigan's. Vaughn
would end the day with 201 yards rushing, and Grbac would
complete 17 of 30 passes for 190 yards as Michigan outgained
the Irish, 443 yards to 399. That doesn't happen often.
   The Wolverines might have gone home smiling if not for two
plays. One was a Mirer pass late in quarter three that
bounced from the hands of flanker Raghib Ismail to those of
teammate Lake Dawson and turned a third-down-and-15 situation
on the Irish 15 yard line into a first down in the drive that
pulled Notre Dame from 14-24 to 21-24.
   The other was an end zone interception of a Grbac pass by
Irish linebacker Michael Stonebreaker after the Wolverines
had moved, on the ground, from their own 18-yard-line to ND's
11 in the final quarter for what could have been a clinching
score. "A couple of calls by me didn't prove out to be good
calls," Moeller said later, including that play in.
   Still, Notre Dame had to win it at the end, and young
Mirer was up to the task. On the final Irish drive, a
76-yarder, he completed five of six passes for 52 yards. The
last of those, on a roll out to the right, found flanker
Adrian Jarrell at the goal line between two defenders with
1:40 left.
   "Rick was full of confidence in the huddle {on the winning
drive}, and he made believers of us," said Jarrell. "Some
guys have a way of doing that."
   And a lot of them seem to wind up at Notre Dame.

   AUSTRALIA FINES SONY

   The Australian unit of Japan's Sony Corp. was criticized
by Australian antitrust regulators and fined by a federal
court.
   Sony (Australia) Pty. was fined 250,000 Australian dollars
(US$206,750) for six breaches of the Trade Practices Act.
Sony officials in Australia were fined an additional
A$37,000.
   Two Brisbane retailers alleged that Sony withheld supply
of electronic and entertainment equipment because the
retailers had discounted the goods below prices set by the
company.
   The court said the maximum fines weren't adequate to deter
Sony from breaking the law. It said the fines should be
increased in the future. Currently, the maximum penalty for a
breach by a corporation is A$250,000 and the maximum penalty
for a person is A$50,000.
                                                                                                       

   CORN FLAKES AND CAFE AU LAIT
                                                                                                       

   A U.S. Agriculture Department report said corn flakes and
other cereals are gaining favor in France. The report in the
October issue of AgExporter magazine said sales of breakfast
cereals in France rose 25% in value last year, following a
growth of more than 80% from 1985 to 1988. It said 1989
French imports of breakfast cereals were valued at $5.9
million and totaled 30,496 metric tons, or 92% of total
sales. Most of the imports came from West Germany, where
Kellogg Co. -- the most popular brand on French store shelves
-- has a plant. Other major suppliers were Britain and Italy.
                                                                                                       

   FINANCING JAPANESE POLITICS
                                                                                                       

   Funds raised by Japanese politicians, political parties
and groups climbed to a record $1.23 billion in 1989, a 0.6%
rise over the previous year, the Home Affairs Ministry said.
The Japan Communist Party topped the list of fund-raising
parties with a record $214 million, the ministry said. The
Communists get about 80% of their funds from the party's Red
Flag newspaper, which claims a circulation of around three
million. Next were the ruling Liberal Democratic Party with
$178 million and the Komeito (Clean Government Party) with
$107 million.
                                                                                                       

   BERLIN'S RABID FOXES
                                                                                                       

   Since the Berlin Wall crumbled last November, 37 rabid
foxes have been found in West Berlin, including one at a
crowded swimming pool. About 10 people have been bitten,
according to West Berlin Health Department spokesman
Thomas-Peter Gallon. "The fall of the borders with East
Germany not only led to people moving freely, but also
foxes," Mr. Gallon said. "Before, rabies had been virtually
wiped out."
                                                                                                       

   MALAYSIA'S TOURISM EARNINGS RISE
                                                                                                       

   The Visit Malaysia Year 1990 promotion is paying
dividends, with tourism to the country bringing in 2.5
billion ringgit ($926.5 million) during the first eight
months of the year, up from 1.8 billion ringgit for the same
period last year, Culture and Tourism Minister Sabaruddin
Chik said. The government had estimated that its overseas
promotional campaign would bring in only 2.5 billion ringgit
for the whole of 1990, Mr. Chik said.
                                                                                                       

   CONTROVERSY IN NORWAY
                                                                                                       

   Norway's Prime Minister Jan Syse stirred up a political
controversy Friday when he admitted to violating Norwegian
corporate law. Mr. Syse is chairman of a company that owns a
small apartment building in Oslo; the company failed to
comply with a rule that corporate accounts must be registered
each year with the Register of Company Accounts. Although no
one who has broken the rule has ever been taken to court, a
violation could in theory lead to a fine or up to a year in
jail. Opposition parties attacked the Conservative prime
minister, and the Socialist Left Party urged him to resign.
                                                                                                       

   GREEN LIGHT FOR IBERIA
                                                                                                       

   Spain's national airline Iberia was given the go-ahead by
the Spanish government to acquire Lufthansa's 48% stake in
the Spanish charter company Vuelos Internacionales de
Vacaciones S.A.
   Spain's national airline will pay 840 million pesetas
($8.5 million) for the West German carrier's shareholding in
the charter company, raising to 96% its stake in Vuelos,
known as Viva Air. The remaining 4% of the shares are evenly
split between Spanish public financial-services company
Infoleasing and the West German tour operator A. Paukner.
   Lufthansa officials said recently that a slump in Spanish
tourism drove the airline to sell its share in Viva Air. They
added that Lufthansa is eager to refocus its investments in
Eastern Europe.
   Viva Air, which owns five Boeing 737300 airplanes and
holds two DC9-30 planes on lease, ranks as Spain's
second-largest charter company in terms of number of
passengers.

   Czechoslovakia's Frantisek Cardinal Tomasek, an outspoken
advocate of religious freedom during decades of communist
control, is planning to retire within a month, the official
CTK news agency said. "The age of 91 is not normal for
activities in any field, including the church," CTK quoted
Czechoslovakia's senior Roman Catholic clergyman as saying. .
. . Foreign-ministry officials from Greece and Turkey will
meet in Ankara this week to try to start "a new dialogue,"
the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. The two nations have
wrangled for decades over Cyprus and territorial rights in
the Aegean Sea.

   George Bush Just
   Sends Fish Reeling

   Lure Maker Finds That Fish

   The Education President

   Ten minutes on the phone with Dr. Juice was all it took to
answer three of the eternal questions:
   1. Do fish sleep?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   2. Can fish smell?
   3. Why can't George Bush catch fish?
   The first question actually could have been answered
without Dr. Juice's help. Readers willing to jump into the
ocean at night with a flashlight will see fish sleeping all
over the place. Parrotfish even wear nightgowns --
muumuu-shaped membranes that they store in their mouths when
they aren't asleep.
   The second question: Not only can fish smell, they are
extraordinarily good at it, according to Dr. Juice, maker of
the world-renowned (in certain circles) Dr. Juice One Drop
Fish Scent and the brand new Dr. Juice Chewee Juice scent --
impregnated biodegradable crickets, mayflies, minnows and
crawfish. Dr. Juice happens to be the George Washington
Carver of biodegradable crickets.
   Juice isn't his real name, of course. His parents named
him Gregory Bambenek, and he's a 42-year-old physician and
psychiatrist in Duluth, Minn., who is medical director at an
Indian reservation drug-treatment center and a county
nursing-home Alzheimer's-disease unit. He's also a crazed
fisherman who is president of Osmic Research Inc., where he
employs around 40 physically and mentally handicapped people
to make, bottle and package Dr. Juice products.
   Osmic is where Dr. Juice also conducts his secret
fish-smelling experiments, in which he anesthetizes fish and
measures their nervous reactions to very dilute solutions --
say, one drop of some chemical in a 55-gallon barrel of
water.
   Fish, he says, have "one of the most elaborate and
sensitive olfactory systems in nature." A really good hunting
dog can smell 1,000 times better than his master. And a fish
can smell 1,000 times better than that dog. You put one drop
of something in Lake Erie and some fish are so sensitive they
can smell it anywhere in the lake, he says.
   Smart fishermen have used smells, or scents, to catch fish
for centuries, says Dr. Juice. Kings of England had their own
royal fishing scent makers.
   Dr. Juice says he met a mysterious Indian medicine man in
Belize in 1978 who not only healed the sick but also caught
snook, tarpon and a local fish called bandarootoo with
nothing more than a hook, a line and a piece of cloth. It
turned out that what was on that cloth was a secret formula
of smells from jungle plants, fish and animals, which Dr.
Juice rushed home to analyze.
   That same year Dr. Juice came out with a batch of his
first scent, made up of pheromones. He took a sex pheromone,
which turns fish on and attracts them; added a fear
pheromone, which tells big fish where scared little fish are;
and threw in for good measure some schooling pheromone, which
teaches fish their ABCs.
   In the late '70s and early '80s, fishing scents took off.
Pretty soon, all sorts of companies smelling money had scents
out on the fishing-tackle market, which is a huge market,
according to Joe Kuti, who works for the American Fishing
Tackle Manufacturers Association: About 50 million fishermen
in this country spend about $2.2 billion a year on retail
fishing gear. They spend $450 million to $500 million on
fishing lures alone, Mr. Kuti guesses. They'll buy anything
with hooks that's dangled in front of them, but the plastic
worm is the largest part of the lure market. "It's an easy
lure to fish with. . . . It's kind of hard to screw up a
worm," Mr. Kuti says.
   The rage these days is plastic worms with scents put
inside them in the factory. They're called "impregnated
baits," and they're made out of a soft polyvinyl chloride
called plastisol that oozes scents into the water for months.
Says In-Fisherman Magazine: "Scented baits will create more
fishing enthusiasm and catch more fish than any other lure
innovation in the 1990s."
   But Dr. Juice says impregnated plastic baits are bad news.
They look, feel, smell and taste like food. Fish eat them. So
do birds, otters and other animals. The animals' stomachs
can't digest the plastic, so it sits there making the
creatures feel full. They stop eating and starve to death.
Dr. Juice talked to a veterinarian at Sea World in Orlando a
few years back and heard about people bringing in sick
otters. The vet flushed them with mineral oil and out came
all these red and green and yellow and blue plastic worms.
   "We know they're killing birds and fish and mammals right
now," says Dr. Juice. "These things take hundreds of years to
biodegrade and fishermen lose tons of them every year."
   Dr. Juice dumps on plastic worms not only because he's an
environmentalist but also because he smells profit in his new
non-plastic biodegradable worms and bugs. They're made out of
amino acids and whether or not they actually catch fish, they
do degrade. In a highly scientific experiment right here on
my desk, I put a plastic cricket and a Dr. Juice cricket in
some swamp water and sure enough, in two weeks, the Dr. Juice
cricket disintegrated into a blob of white goo on the bottom,
the plastic cricket was unchanged, and my co-workers stopped
coming by to schmooze.
   If fish smell things they like, they also smell things
they don't like, says Dr. Juice. "The fish olfactory organ .
. . can detect repellent substances from man at a dilution of
one part per 80 billion."
   This is where George Bush comes in. L-serine is a
repugnant amino acid secreted by people and other mammals
such as bears and sea lions. Fish fear and loathe it.
Professional bass fishermen secrete very little of it. George
Bush is a walking L-serine factory.
   Dr. Juice knows this because he took Mr. Bush's
fingerprint at a 1988 fishing tackle show in Springfield,
Mo., and tested it.
   "Bush is very high. He'd be about a 12, like me," Dr.
Juice says. That means George Bush repels fish. He's so high
in L-serine secretions that he should not bait his own hook
or anybody else's (such as Gorby's) because his fingerprint
on the bait will stink up the water with L-serine and send
fish zooming in the other direction. (Unless, of course, he
has a handy bottle of Dr. Juice Hand and Lure Cleaner. Only
$7.80.)

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- National Medical Enterprises Inc.,
a health care concern, said it will redeem on Oct. 15 all
extendable notes, due 1999, that haven't been tendered for
repayment on or before Oct. 1.
   The company has $98 million of the notes outstanding. It
issued the notes in October 1984. National Medical said it
will redeem the notes at 100% of the principal amount.
Interest accrued through Oct. 14 will be paid to notes of
record Sept. 30. The current interest rate is 9.4%, and the
current interest-rate period expires Oct. 14.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Note holders' option of tendering for repayment arises
when a new interest period and rate for the extendable notes
is established. Under terms of the notes, the company must
establish a new interest period and rate for a five-year
period beginning Oct. 15. National Medical has set an
interest rate of 8.65% for the coming five-year period.

   LOS ANGELES -- RCM Technologies Inc. expects to become
profitable as it changes from primarily being a provider of
services to a provider of technology, Robert Sackett,
chairman and chief executive officer, said.
   In the meantime, the company reported a loss of $88,598
for the fiscal third quarter ended July 31, compared with a
loss of $149,913 a year earlier. Revenue rose 16% to $7.1
million from $6.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Sackett predicted that revenue for all of fiscal 1990
will exceed $28 million, compared with $22.7 million in
fiscal 1989. He said the company expected a full-year loss of
less than $400,000, compared with a loss of $774,166, or six
cents a share, in fiscal 1989.
   The executive said RCM expects to become profitable in
fiscal 1991 because of sales of a new technology that has
cost the company about $600,000 to $700,000 a year to
develop, but which hasn't yet generated any revenue. RCM's
revenue currently comes from providing engineering, technical
and temporary services through its Intertec Design unit to
such companies as Dow Chemical Co., Boeing Co. and United
Technologies Corp. RCM is lessening its exposure to the
aerospace industry component of this business, adding that
United Technologies' Sikorsky unit has already been affected
by defense-spending cuts.
   But Mr. Sackett said he believes the company's new
technology, its System 99, which is designed to remove
pollutants from power plants and factories that burn
high-sulphur coal, could create revenue of $600 million to
$700 million a year within 10 years. The technology, which
customers could use to comply with pending acid-rain
legislation, currently is being considered by several
coal-fired utilities in the Midwest, Mr. Sackett said.
   The company recently reached agreement with a unit of CBI
Industries Inc. under which CBI would do the construction
work on all System 99s that are ordered.
   "We're not that credible yet," Mr. Sackett acknowledged.
"CBI gives us credibility in the marketplace." Each order for
System 99 would be worth about $20 million to $30 million to
the partners, he added, and CBI is big enough to handle the
more than 20 jobs a year it would take for RCM to reach its
eventual revenue projections. Just one order, Mr. Sackett
said, would make RCM profitable.
   RCM says its System 99 removes more than 90% of pollutants
created by burning such coal, including sulfur oxides and
nitrous oxides, without leaving mass quantities of sludge
that can pollute groundwater. There also isn't any need to
pump large quantities of water since it's a dry system.
   RCM operates a commercial-size demonstration facility in
Camden, N.J.

of other service that will entail furloughing pilots and
other personnel.
   Among the changes, WestAir said it plans to begin service
Oct. 15 between Dulles airport outside Washington, D.C., and
Charlotte, N.C. On Oct. 31, WestAir said it will expand
service between Los Angeles and San Diego, as well as resume
flights between Long Beach, Calif., and San Jose, Calif.
</LP>

   WestAir also announced cutbacks in service that will
result in the termination of 99 of its about 2,780 employees.
Included are 25 customer-service personnel and 24 pilots. In
addition, 50 pilots are set to be furloughed as the result of
schedule adjustments in California, WestAir said.
   The company added that it plans to retire a dozen aircraft
by year end, replacing them with more fuel-efficient models.
Currently, the company has a fleet of about 100 aircraft.

   My career was a shambles. Every time I told my editor a
joke he would throw me out of his office. My clothes were
ill-fitting and poorly color-coordinated. Better restaurants
would not let me eat in them because of my atrocious table
manners. Then a miracle happened. The three books reviewed
below landed on my desk. Today, I am on the fast track at
work. Colleagues stop by and ask me for advice on which fork
to use for their lunch engagements at Lutece. Then they want
to know if I think their tie matches their socks. And I
receive more invitations to give after-dinner speeches than I
can comfortably handle. If you envy my new-found condition in
life, read on.
   "The Concise Guide to Executive Etiquette" (Doubleday, 194
page, $9.95), by Linda and Wayne Phillips, is a little book
-- it's actually pocket-size -- so you need never be without
the correct answers. After reading it I found out how many
things I had been doing wrong. For example, suppose an
amorous couple sitting in front of you at the theater are
keeping their heads together and spoiling your view. Before
reading this book I would have said: "Hey you jerks. If you
want to fool around, rent a hotel room." The Phillipses
suggest: "I can't see if you keep your heads together."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What about giving your boss a birthday gift? My rule: Only
give whoopee cushions, squirt guns or similar items of high
intrinsic and intense emotional value. Such gifts can never
be misconstrued. The Phillipses suggest a thoughtful letter
telling your employer how much you enjoy your association
with the company.
   How good a wine should you order when dining with a client
(or a source)? My solution: "Waiter, we would like a
half-gallon of anything with `Thunder' or `Strawberry' in its
name." The Phillipses agree with me on this one. They say
don't order expensive wines because it sends a negative
message to the client: "Oh, am I going to make a lot of money
off you]"

   G. Bruce Boyer, author of "Eminently Suitable" (Norton,
256 pages, $19.95), has written a book that is supposed to
help men learn to dress tastefully. He doesn't tell the
reader outright how he should dress. He just gives him a role
model and says the reader should dress as he dresses. His
ideal: Fred Astaire. He claims that Mr. Astaire had what is
known in Italian as "sprezzatura", which translates as
nonchalance. He claims that dressing with nonchalance is a
studied pose and that it is a skill worth acquiring. Mr.
Boyer says no one is born with it.
   Nonchalance, according to the author, is achieved through
the smaller touches -- a scarf, a pair of socks or an
out-of-the-ordinary hat. He says such touches will do more
than purple slacks and a mauve topcoat. (Oh shucks. There
goes my one really stylish outfit of which I am most fond.)
Even after reading Mr. Boyer's book I am not sure many men
will look like they are ready to pick up their top hats and
canes and give Ginger Rogers a whirl around the dance floor.
The author admits that this is so toward the end of the book
when he writes, "Sprezzatura is a bit like jazz or poetry:
easy to recognize, sticky to define, difficult to do well."

   Many of us have learned the hard way that there is a
difference between telling a joke to a few friends and
telling one to an audience in a business setting. But Malcolm
Kushner in his book "The Light Touch" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 270
pages, $18.95) says it is because we inevitably make The Big
Mistake: We try to use humor that is irrelevant to the point
of the talk. Mr. Kushner claims humor can be used, among
other things, to manage conflict, motivate people and improve
productivity. He says you have to be neither a comedian nor
"naturally funny." According to Mr. Kushner, the key to using
humor successfully frequently can be found in analogies that
have a twist to them. They let a speaker make a point and put
the audience in a receptive frame of mind simultaneously.
   Consider the spot an executive found himself in after
giving a presentation to a hostile audience. He turned for
help to an analogy that he hoped would turn some of the
audience's anger to sympathy for his message. He concluded
with: "Thank you. I feel like a friend of mine, who had to
ride his bicycle home after a vasectomy."
   Mr. Kushner says making humor relevant can be cured by
using the rule of the three As: Authorize, Analyze and
Analogize. Authorize means that the author should first write
his serious message. The humor should only be inserted into
the talk to augment the talk's basic points. That is followed
by Analysis of the serious message to see how humor can help.
Finally, by Analogy the speaker can relate an anecdote to one
of the serious points.
   As an example he cites a litigator who was to be the fifth
defense attorney to make a closing argument after a very long
trial. There was nothing he could say that hadn't been said
and the jury knew it. The litigator began: "I feel sort of
like Zsa Zsa Gabor's fifth husband. I think I know what to
do, but I don't know if I can make it interesting." The jury
howled and listened to every word of his closing argument.

   Georgia Corn Crop
   May Be Tainted
   With Aflatoxin

   High levels of aflatoxin were discovered in the milk of a
Georgia processor, according to state Agriculture
Commissioner Tommy Irvin.
   The discovery is the first sign that the Georgia corn crop
might have been contaminated by the potent carcinogen, which
is excreted by a soil fungus under droughtlike conditions.
After the nationwide drought in 1988, contaminated milk in
several states was traced to dairy cows that had been
unknowingly fed aflatoxin-laced corn.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The threat to consumers isn't clear. Mr. Irvin said that
1,395 gallons of milk from the unidentified processor were
destroyed long before it reached stores. But Georgia milk
processors face a difficult year. The early indication is
that aflatoxin might be widespread in the state's corn crop,
much of which is fed to livestock.
   Of 45 Georgia corn fields recently surveyed for state and
federal authorities, about 60% were found to have aflatoxin
in excess of the amount considered safe for human
consumption.
   Because of the region's warm climate, corn grown in the
South is the most vulnerable in the nation to aflatoxin
outbreaks. Crop experts have been worried about the chances
of an aflatoxin outbreak in Georgia since an intense hot and
dry spell damaged much of the corn crop in June.
   Aflatoxin is a carcinogen in laboratory rats and has been
linked to human liver cancer in Asia and Africa. For more
than a decade, the poison has been detected in Southerners
and doctors have debated whether it is a serious health
hazard.
   Earlier this month, aflatoxin was detected by officials in
Texas corn corps, the second such outbreak there in as many
years.
   The most serious aflatoxin outbreak occurred during the
1988 drought that seared the Midwest. Dairy farmers in six
states dumped milk, and authorities detected the poison in
milled corn and such products as popcorn and cereal.

   DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Premark International Inc. said it will

concerning food-wrapping machine patents.
   The consumer and restaurant products concern said that in
return for the payment, Weldotron, based in Piscataway, N.J.,
has dropped its lawsuits and has agreed not to attempt to
enforce the patents against Hobart, a Premark subsidiary that
produces a broad line of food equipment including
food-wrapping machines.

   Premark said Weldotron sought total damages of more than
$200 million in two lawsuits filed in 1986 in the U.S.
District Court of New Jersey alleging that the unit infringed
on its patents. Hobart countersued, claiming the patents were
invalid and unenforceable.
   Premark said it decided to settle the suits to avoid the
uncertainty and additional costs of further litigation. A
spokesman for Premark said that the settlement will have a
financial impact on the company, but that it hasn't
determined if a charge will be necessary.

   Ex-Thrift Owner
   Gets Five Years
   On Fraud Charge

   DALLAS -- Former thrift owner Laurence Vineyard Jr. was
sentenced to five years in federal prison for defrauding the
defunct Vernon Savings Association, Dallas, of $2.6 million,
much of which was used to buy a mansion for Mr. Vineyard's
family.
   The purchase of the home tangled thrift regulators'
efforts to recoup the Vernon funds because Texas law protects
homesteads, regardless of value, from creditors. The law was
the subject of a page one article in this newspaper last
December.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Vineyard recently agreed to sell his $1,180,000 home
and use the proceeds to begin repaying $17 million he
borrowed from Vernon Savings, according to Steven Hoard, an
Amarillo, Texas, lawyer who represented the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. in its collection efforts.
   Mr. Vineyard had borrowed the money from Vernon to repay
earlier loans for his purchase of the now-defunct Key Savings
&amp; Loan Association of Englewood, Colo. Mr. Vineyard was
convicted in 1987 of fraud charges related to the Key Savings
purchase and sentenced to five years in federal prison. He
has nearly completed that sentence.
   The new five-year prison sentence was handed down last
week by U.S. District Judge Joe Fish of Dallas. Mr. Vineyard
had pleaded guilty in July to defrauding Vernon by using
funds he borrowed from the thrift to purchase his home, pay
his lawyers and establish trust funds for his children.
   "That wasn't what it was supposed to be used for," Mr.
Hoard said. "It was supposed to be used to pay off debt he
had incurred in purchasing Key Savings."
   Judge Fish ordered Mr. Vineyard to repay the $2.6 million
as part of his sentence. Those funds will be added to the
funds from the sale of his home and to the money to be
returned from the Vineyard children's trust accounts. Mr.
Hoard said negotiations are continuing on repayment of the
fees to Mr. Vineyard's lawyers.
   But Mr. Hoard noted that the chances of Mr. Vineyard's
repaying the entire $17 million he borrowed from Vernon are
slim. Mr. Vineyard, 41 years old, was stripped of his law
license two years ago as a result of the Key Savings
conviction and has said he intends to work as an electrician,
a trade he learned in federal prison.

   Finding More Room
   For Ethics in Divorces
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   DIVORCE lawyers are grappling with increasingly difficult
ethical dilemmas.
   As custody and financial battles between estranged spouses
grow more intense, divorce lawyers are wondering whether
putting up a good fight for their clients is always ethical.
The 1,200-member American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers is
drafting a code of ethics that will address such conundrums.
The group says it is making a special effort to address
obligations to children.
   Stephen Sessums, a Tampa, Fla., lawyer and chairman of the
committee drafting the code, says the "Rambo lawyer" who uses
"the legal arsenal to bludgeon the other side" may inflict
lasting damage on family relationships that must survive a
bitter divorce. "It is important to look for ways to reach a
compromise or decision or a result where everybody wins," he
says.
   Robert H. Aronson, an associate dean of the University of
Washington School of Law who is helping to draft the code,
says it will strongly encourage settlement or arbitration in
divorces.
   The code is also likely to suggest that lawyers consider
the best interests of children during divorce proceedings and
that they report incidents of child abuse or the possibility
of abuse to authorities, even if their client is the abuser,
says Mr. Aronson.
                                                                                                       

   And You Think There Are
   Too Many Practicing Law
                                                                                                       

   SOME LAWYERS say Scott Turow had the right idea.
   In the wake of the success of Mr. Turow's "Presumed
Innocent" and "The Burden of Proof," many lawyers have taken
to their word processors. Several have recently produced
crime novels, complete with allegedly true-to-life courtroom
scenes.
   Bantam Books just published "To Speak for the Dead," by
Paul Levine, a Miami lawyer. Mr. Levine, once a partner in
the Miami office of Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius, a law firm based
in Philadelphia, says he found "running around the country
defending asbestos cases . . . to be a less than personally
satisfying experience." He says his main character "reflects
some of my cynicism."
   For Jay Brandon's "Fade the Heat," published last month by
Pocket Books, an option on the movie rights has been
purchased by Steven Spielberg. Mr. Brandon, who wrote three
previous novels, just quit his job drafting opinions with the
Court of Appeals in San Antonio, Texas, and expects to devote
his time to writing and criminal defense work. The jacket of
his novel touts it as "a masterpiece of legal intrigue in the
best Scott Turow tradition."
   But despite the success of Mr. Turow, a partner in a
Chicago law firm, some publishers wish lawyers would stick to
practicing law. "All lawyers think that they can write
because they dictate interminably," says Howard Kaminsky,
president of Hearst Trade Book Group. "A lot more word
processors {are} being bought and a lot more lawyers {are}
writing novels," Mr. Kaminsky says, but "I don't look forward
to reading them."
                                                                                                       

   Large Firms Overcome
   Marketing Reticence
                                                                                                       

   BIG LAW FIRMS, which traditionally have eschewed
self-promotion, are making some bold marketing moves.
   The July issue of California Lawyer, a trade publication,
had a six-page color advertisement for Baker &amp; McKenzie,
which has 1,600 lawyers in 44 countries. A profile of the law
firm was accompanied by photos of lawyers and a world map
with Baker &amp; McKenzie's branches marked. The ad cost about
$35,000.
   "No law firm has ever done anything like that before,"
says Chet Holmes, California Lawyer's associate publisher.
"No law firm has ever run a profile of itself in any
publication."
   Timothy Tosta, a partner in the firm, says that although
some of his colleagues were reluctant to place the ad, it has
"brought us enormous recognition, which inevitably leads to
business."
   Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey, a firm of about 400 lawyers
based in Cleveland, is trying a subtler approach. To mark its
centennial, it has underwritten the cost of an exhibit of
paintings by Winslow Homer at the Cleveland Museum of Art.
The show will travel to museums in Columbus, Ohio, and
Washington, D.C., where the law firm also has offices.
   Squire Sanders's donation was $450,000, payable over three
years. Museum and law firm spokesmen say they believe it is
the largest gift ever by a law firm to a cultural
institution.
   John F. Lewis, a Squire Sanders partner, says an early
partner of the firm was instrumental in founding the museum,
and the firm decided the gift was an appropriate way to say
"thank you to the community that gave birth to us and
nurtured us."
                                                                                                       

   California PAC Adopts
   A Higher Profile
                                                                                                       

   CALIFORNIA lawyers are becoming more aggressive in the
political arena about their professional interests.
   The California Lawyers Political Action Committee was
launched in 1988 to oppose legislation "that was anti-lawyer,
anti-consumer," says P. Terry Anderlini, the PAC's treasurer
and a former state bar group president. So far, it has
opposed a push for non-licensed legal technicians and fought
proposed changes in how judicial candidates are reviewed. The
PAC recently decided to hire a lobbyist and take positions on
legislation on legal issues.
   But that will take money, and so far the PAC has raised a
little over $30,000. "I don't find lawyers eager to give
money," says Luther Avery, a San Francisco lawyer who has
tried his hand at fund raising for the PAC. "It's a hard
sell. The automatic response {by} a lawyer to any question is
`No,' or `I'll think about it.'"

   South Africa's `Informals' Are Stirring

   South Africa does not offer much encouragement to the
world's natural optimists. Violence rages in the black
townships, aggravated by overcrowding that results from an
influx of blacks from rural areas and such destitute
neighboring countries as Zambia and Mozambique. The economy
is in recession; production in the second quarter declined at
an annual rate of 1%. Communists, with nothing to offer other
than a rapid trip to economic disaster, flaunt their new
freedoms.
   President F.W. de Klerk has moved in the direction
demanded by the anti-apartheid activists of Europe and
America, but has received little recognition for his courage.
Indeed, with South Africa rapidly becoming a bloody
battleground (500 violent deaths in August alone) its foreign
critics have become uncharacteristically silent. They now
prefer to pretend that it doesn't exist, which means that the
economic sanctions they demanded remain in place, with little
promise that positive measures to dismantle apartheid will be
rewarded.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It takes some serious searching to find any bright spots
in all of this. But South Africans of all races have
developed a certain resiliency out of their many tensions and
conflicts and maintain something of a frontier spirit. Elias
Links, consul-general in Zurich and one of his associates,
finance counselor Bruce Cameron, have been trying to talk up
South Africa's prospects with Western bankers. One
achievement has been to persuade the World Bank to at least
resume research on South Africa's needs, even if there are no
immediate prospects for real lending.
   One little light of hope glimmers when Mr. Links, who is a
black and a former university economics professor, uses the
expression "informal sector" in referring to growing
grass-roots enterprise among South African blacks. Yes
indeed, he says, he has read the writings of Hernando de
Soto, the Peruvian author who coined that expression.
Moreover, Mr. De Soto's ideas are making some impression on
the South African government. Along with dismantling
apartheid, the government is weakening as well barriers
preventing blacks from becoming entrepreneurs.
   Mr. Links cites the case of black-owned and operated
buses. As with many nations of its type, South Africa has
discouraged competition against state transportation systems
from private carriers. But restrictions have been eased and
service by small, privately-owned buses has been thriving.
Toyota -- not a company to miss a bet -- is supplying a bus
specially designed for economical transport. Black-operated
repair shops and maintenance facilities are growing up around
service.
   That is exactly the sort of thing Hernando de Soto has
been promoting for a decade as a prescription for bringing
real capitalism to countries where private capitalism has
been largely reserved for protected elites. His book, "The
Other Path," (meaning a path other the one promoted
throughout the Third World by Socialist revolutionaries) has
received acclaim throughout the world. In a speech to the IMF
a year ago, President George Bush said that "De Soto's
greatest contribution has been to point out what, in
retrospect, may seem obvious: People everywhere want the same
things. And when left alone by government, people everywhere
organize their lives in remarkably similar ways."
   One of the often-overlooked truths about postwar South
Africa is the economic engineering that accompanies
Pretoria's social engineering. The progenitors of the ruling
Nationalist Party, such men as D.F. Malan and H.F. Vervoerd,
had far more in common with the early Bolsheviks of Russia
than with American capitalism. They were paternalists,
envisioning -- perhaps sincerely -- a social system in which
whites, blacks, coloreds and Asians could live happily, but
separately.
   An overlay of capitalism, mainly in the form of private
gold mining enterprises and foreign-owned manufacturing,
covered up and helped finance a large and intrusive public
sector. It managed the lives of non-whites with full
confidence that Pretoria knew what was best for them. The
non-whites lived better, with better housing and hygienic
standards, than blacks anywhere else in Africa, but with
little freedom to develop along lines of their own choosing.
   Nonetheless, as Mr. Links points out, many blacks think
that South Africa is a "capitalist" state and that apartheid
is one result. They have been encouraged in that view by the
likes of Joe Slovo, the white general secretary of the South
African Communist Party. Mr. Slovo and his followers dominate
the militant wing of the African National Congress, and show
no signs that they are prepared to deviate from their
efforts, through the use of violence, to make South Africa a
Communist state.
   Some other ANC members, including quite possibly Nelson
Mandela, may be having some second thoughts about the
direction the militants are heading. But, as so often
happens, the militants have made themselves feared by anyone
who might prefer a moderate course. Violent death can come
very suddenly, and has often done so, to moderates.
Resistance from the militants deters Mr. Mandela from making
peace with Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha movement. It is
composed mainly of Zulus, South Africa's largest black tribal
nation. ANC-Inkatha strife accounts for much of the country's
bloodshed.
   The tragedy is that Mr. Buthelezi is market-oriented and
understands the importance of empowering all Africans with
fundamental economic rights, to own property and operate
businesses free of excessive government restriction. As the
Soviet Union is discovering, economic empowerment is just as
important as a means of energizing an economy as the granting
of political rights.
   Yet another tragedy is that economic sanctions --
especially those applied by the U.S. -- have largely removed
from South Africa the kinds of influences that would be most
helpful in encouraging the "informal sector" to seek true
legal status and develop from the ground up. American
businessmen, having been raised in a system where private
businesses start small and grow, understand the process well.
Their prevailing egalitarianism helped break down color
barriers in their plants. But because of pressures applied to
their parent companies in the U.S. -- often by groups that
were more concerned about their own domestic political goals
than about the future of South Africa's blacks -- most have
left.
   Whether economic empowerment will damp the flames of
violence is a crucial issue. Mr. Links thinks it will help
and, as a South African black, he is better qualified to
judge than an outsider. Obviously, an "informal sector"
operating in a legal void cannot be transformed into
entrepreneurial economy in short order. But awareness of that
potential is a start, and gives some light to an otherwise
gloomy outlook.

   TORONTO -- Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. said it is
negotiating long-term project financing for its Canary Wharf
real estate development in London, which eventually is
expected to cost about #4 billion ($7.53 billion).
   An Olympia &amp; York spokesman said two separate project
financings were under negotiation. He declined to describe
their size or possible terms. He said they wouldn't be used
to reduce the company's #500 million equity stake in the
project.

   Canary Wharf is an office project meant to be the
centerpiece of the world's biggest property development, the
commercial-residential Docklands redevelopment.
   Olympia &amp; York so far has sunk more than #1 billion into
Canary Wharf, which still isn't finished. The spokesman said
the loans under negotiation would be the first project
financings for the development.
   Developers normally fund the early stages of a development
with short-term construction loans, then refinance that debt
with longer-term loans that are secured by the project
itself.
   Such project loans may be further guaranteed by the
developer, or may be nonrecourse loans without such
guarantees. The spokesman declined to describe the degree of
exposure that Olympia &amp; York might have under the proposed
financings.
   Canary Wharf has had trouble attracting tenants, which
could pose financial uncertainty for Olympia &amp; York, which is
owned by Toronto's Reichmann family. A first phase of 4.3
million square feet is to open next year, but only about half
the space has been rented.
   The Olympia &amp; York spokesman said the company remains
firmly committed to the project. He said its #500 million
equity investment "will remain in place at least until the
project is entirely completed."

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- When R.S. Miller Jr., vice
chairman of Chrysler Corp., addressed a dinner meeting of
company managers a couple of years ago, he concluded by
inviting questions from the floor. The first to raise a hand
was Mr. Miller's wife, Maggie, who had accompanied him to the
event. Would Mr. Miller run Chrysler differently, she asked,
if he were chairman instead of Lee Iacocca?
   The question startled Mr. Miller, but he quickly
recovered. His first move, he replied, would be to bar
spouses from corporate meetings. The group broke up in
laughter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nowadays, though, the question isn't so funny. Lots of
people, both inside and outside Chrysler, wonder how the
company would be doing without Mr. Iacocca. That's because
Chrysler is doing so badly with him.
   Mr. Iacocca vows to stay the course and lead Chrysler out
of its problems. But with remarkable candor, he concedes that
he is to blame for many of the company's woes. "I'm
confessing my sins here," declares Mr. Iacocca, who turns 66
next month.
   The confessional is Mr. Iacocca's office, crammed with 44
years of mementos that include the checks with which Chrysler
repaid its bail-out loans and a stuffed toy replica of Mr.
Iacocca driving a car while puffing a cigar. In two hours of
stream-of-consciousness monologue on his couch, he darts from
topic to topic: trade with Japan, the federal deficit, and
his attempt, in the twilight of his career, to forge Comeback
II.
   His big sin, Mr. Iacocca says, was trying to diversify.
His decision put the company into the aerospace and defense
businesses, but siphoned management attention and money from
the crucial task of producing new vehicles. Now Chrysler has
sold, or is trying to sell, those businesses. Meanwhile, it
hasn't brought to market a single new car whose development
was begun after Mr. Iacocca arrived in 1978. Chrysler's
current lineup still derives from the decade-old K-car.
   Along with diversification came a top-heavy holding
company structure that sent Chrysler's costs soaring. The
company must now sell 1.9 million cars and trucks a year just
to break even. That's far above the break-even point of 1.1
million vehicles in 1985 and a much bigger increase than can
be justified by Chrysler's 1987 purchase of American Motors
Corp.
   What's more, fewer customers are buying. Chrysler's car
and truck sales have plunged nearly 17% this year, even
though industrywide sales are down just 5%. The company is
likely to wind up 1990 as No. 5 in U.S. car sales, behind
Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. as well as its two
bigger U.S. rivals.
   The price of Chrysler's stock has dipped so low (it closed
Friday at $12, down 12 1/2 cents) that the nation's
eighth-largest industrial company now theoretically could be
bought for about $2.8 billion. No other company among the
nation's 10 largest in sales and revenue is valued by its
stock price at less than $16.8 billion.
   When a Chrysler factory in St. Louis closes next spring as
scheduled, the company will have shuttered one-third of its
assembly plants in three years. The chief executive of one
big auto-parts maker predicts that Chrysler will lose its
independence "no later than the first half of this decade."
Chrysler is discussing joint product development with Italy's
Fiat S.p.A., Mr. Iacocca says, but he adds it's far from
certain that merger talks will follow.
   In fairness to Mr. Iacocca, say his admirers, his wish to
diversify was understandable. Chrysler is being sorely
pressed by Japanese competition, which notably doesn't exist
in the aerospace and defense businesses. General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. made similar moves. Ford, like Chrysler,
is selling those businesses, though GM is sticking with them.
   "If I made a mistake it was following other companies, and
maybe those were grandiose schemes," says Mr. Iacocca. "We
didn't need a holding company. That's what made us
top-heavy."
   The company also erred in launching an expensive, and now
defunct, effort to develop a luxury coupe with Italy's
Maserati S.p.A., he admits. Another error, he adds, was
transferring production -- an expensive process -- of the
Omni/Horizon models to a former American Motors plant in
Kenosha, Wis., and then closing the plant just 15 months
later.
   "If we went astray -- you know people do go astray now and
then in many areas -- man, we got focused in a hurry," says
Mr. Iacocca. "I've been through crises, and I know them. And
I'm not afraid of them." Today's focus, he says, is on
cutting costs and bringing new vehicles to market. But both
are daunting tasks.
   With Chrysler now close to achieving its goal of cutting
$1.5 billion in costs over 15 months, Mr. Iacocca recently
raised the goal to $2.5 billion by next June 30. For a
managerial force that has already endured layoffs,
elimination of bonuses and even cancellation of company-paid
subscriptions, it's like being sentenced to a second winter
at Valley Forge.
   While the recent departure of several top executives,
including heir apparent Gerald Greenwald, got lots of
attention, cost cutting has contributed to a more disturbing
trend: an exodus from upper middle management. A group of
engineers specializing in tailpipe emissions recently left en
masse for Ford. Another top engineer returned to teaching. A
high-level marketing man took a post at one of Ford's ad
agencies. In the first quarter, turnover of so-called
bonus-eligible employees hit three times the normal level,
though it has since subsided.
   As for new vehicles, one that consumers won't see is the
"mini-minivan." It was originally slated for introduction
late last year, but the project was canceled because there
wasn't enough money for it.
   Chrysler does have some attractive new vehicles in the
pipeline. The ZJ, a rounded, modern-looking four-door Jeep,
is scheduled for introduction in early 1992. The LH, a family
of sleek mid-sized sedans, will go on sale in the fall of
that year. Originally, however, those sedans were supposed to
be hitting the market now.
   Innovative and attractive products are what saved Chrysler
in the early 1980s; a paucity of them is what has hurt the
company recently. Douglas Fraser, retired president of the
United Auto Workers union, former Chrysler director and
professed admirer of Mr. Iacocca, puts it bluntly: "Lee has
got to start weaning the company from himself. The company
has got to get more product-oriented, and less Lee Iacocca
oriented."
   It would have been unthinkable for anyone to say that five
years ago. Back then, Mr. Iacocca had just engineered one of
the great corporate comebacks, selling Chrysler's cause to
government officials in Washington, and then selling its cars
(through television commercials) to the American public.
Chrysler's stock soared from $3 a share in 1981 to $80,
adjusted for splits, in 1987. Mr. Iacocca's autobiography
soared as well, to the top of the best-seller lists. He got
rich and became a folk hero, the CEO for the common man.
   Mr. Iacocca headed the Statue of Liberty renovation,
joined a congressional commission on budget reduction and
wrote a second book. He began a syndicated newspaper column,
bought an Italian villa where he started bottling his own
wine and olive oil, and went through a brief and bitter
second marriage and divorce. Critics contend it all
distracted him, and was a root cause of Chrysler's current
problems.
   But Mr. Iacocca counters, "I never worked harder in my
life than in the last couple of years. What happened in '85
and '86? You had a little bit of sloughing off, maybe in the
whole organization. But now the bullets are real.
   "If you ever pick a distraction, pick the right one," he
adds. "We shouldn't have had forays in the defense business.
But don't blame things on the Statue of Liberty or on writing
a book. That's like saying, `Well, what do you do with your
nights?' Well, that's none of your business."
   Distracting or not, it's clear that being a folk hero is a
demanding sideline. Mr. Iacocca recently appeared on a
television special, "Mary Hart Presents," and will soon be
featured in a two-part series on public television. Also, the
January issue of Playboy will include a lengthy interview
with him. Already, Chrysler headquarters is getting calls of
complaint.
   Of course, Mr. Iacocca's celebrity does sell cars for
Chrysler -- or at least it used to. Recent ads, in which he
heralds a survey showing Americans prefer Chrysler cars to
Hondas, may have backfired. "People think the ads are
ridiculous, just on their face," says Mr. Fraser. "Lee had
such tremendous credibility with the American people, and the
Honda ads threaten that."
   Mr. Iacocca is running into a credibility problem inside
Chrysler as well, managers say. To address it, six months ago
he began holding internal "town hall" meetings, each with 175
employees randomly selected by computer. "I talk for five
minutes, and then they get an hour and a half to knock my
head in," he says.
   Some question Mr. Iacocca's decision to spend more than $1
billion, twice the amount originally planned, on a new
technical center (and possible new headquarters) 30 miles
north of Detroit. Inside the company the building is
nicknamed the "Taj Mahal." And, at least privately, some are
second-guessing Mr. Iacocca's biggest move of all, the
purchase of AMC.
   Certainly American Motors has brought Chrysler some huge
benefits. The biggest, by far, is Jeep, one of the best-known
brand names in the world. Until now, the Jeep Cherokee has
had the booming market for four-door sport-utility vehicles
virtually to itself -- a gold mine for Chrysler. Last spring,
however, Ford launched its own four-door -- the more modern,
and less expensive, Explorer. Cherokee sales are running 22%
behind last year.
   Moreover, as part of the acquisition, Chrysler got locked
into devoting its most modern factory to building a car that
it simply can't sell. The car, the Premier, is a mid-sized
sedan developed for American Motors by its controlling
shareholder, Renault S.A. of France. To protect its
investment, Renault insisted that Chrysler agree to build the
car, which is assembled at the former American Motors' plant
in Bramalea, Ont.
   Chrysler made the car part of its new Jeep-Eagle
franchise, hoping the Jeep brand name would provide a halo.
But the Eagle brand, and particularly the Premier model, have
flopped. Sales of the car are so slow that the Bramalea plant
is operating at only about 18% of capacity, about one-fourth
the level required to break even. Compounding the disaster,
Chrysler also may have to pay Renault more than $100 million
in penalties because it is building far fewer Premiers than
the merger agreement required.
   Mr. Iacocca, though, expresses no regrets about American
Motors. "I take the long view," he says. "Bramalea is a great
plant. In total we've had a field day with Jeeps. We've made
a lot of money with them." He concedes, however, that "Eagle
isn't a household word; that's going to be a long haul."
   The key to getting enough new products for Eagle and the
other brands may be enlisting foreign auto makers as partners
-- perhaps even persuading one to buy Chrysler in part or in
whole. Chrysler is talking to several car makers about joint
product development. The most intriguing talks are with Fiat,
say analysts, because they have the best chance of producing
a permanent linkup.
   Will anything come of the discussions? "I don't know, I
can't answer that," Mr. Iacocca replies. "It's the old story,
they want to see how well we're doing. So they say, `Well,
wait a year.' But then we get better and nobody can buy any
equity in us because we want too much for it."
   In any case, he adds, Chrysler doesn't need a cash
infusion just now, even though first-half earnings plunged
64% to $251 million and the third quarter will produce a
substantial loss. The company has about $4.5 billion in cash
or equivalents. Mr. Iacocca notes that even if that cash pile
shrinks by $750 million a year, Chrysler will still have a $3
billion cushion when its new mid-sized cars appear.
   Besides finding a partner, Mr. Iacocca also must select a
successor. The two candidates are Robert A. Lutz, age 58 and
president of Chrysler Motors, and Vice Chairman Miller, age
48. The two men could hardly be more different.
   Mr. Lutz, a cigar-puffing former Marine Corps jet pilot
and former executive vice president at Ford, is the
consummate "car guy." He's the driving force behind the Dodge
Viper, a 10-cylinder sports car that will zoom from zero to
100 miles an hour in less than 10 seconds and will be
introduced in early 1992.
   Mr. Lutz, however, is also a self-confessed "very strong
personality," whose style at Ford prompted one underling, the
highly regarded president of Ford of Europe, to quit abruptly
in 1984. At Chrysler, he has offended some old hands by
giving top product-development jobs to former American Motors
officials.
   Mr. Miller, in contrast, has a thoughtful, soft-spoken
manner and a quick, dry wit. In Chrysler's crisis of the
early 1980s, he was the point man in negotiating with
hundreds of banks -- any of which could have thrust Chrysler
into bankruptcy. But Mr. Miller is a career-long finance man,
and thus lacks Mr. Lutz's broad experience in
product-development and operations.
   "I think either one of them would be a good guy," Mr.
Iacocca says. "I'll watch the two of them for the next 12
months and make a decision."
   Does this mean Mr. Iacocca will step down shortly after
that? His contract expires at the end of 1991. Mr. Iacocca
has agreed to stay longer but isn't saying how long, probably
because he doesn't know himself. Friends and associates say
he loves the perquisites of power -- the bodyguards, the
limelight, the corporate Gulfstream jet. And clearly, the
folk hero doesn't want to go out a loser.
   "I want to make sure that things are squared away," he
says. At the town hall meetings, he outlines Chrysler's
internal goals for sales, market share and earnings. Then he
tells his troops: "The sooner you can get there, the sooner
you get me out of here. I don't know if that's an incentive
or a disincentive, but please don't take too damn long,
because I want to get out."

   Genscher Outlines
   Vision of Global
   Role for Germany

   BONN -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to provide about
$2 billion to support military operations in the Gulf has
underscored Germany's emergence as a world power, and the
resulting costs and demands of that role.
   West Germany's package of assistance, considerably more
than Washington had sought, may have silenced U.S. critics
who had derisively compared Bonn's reluctance to provide
significant help for the Gulf with its agreement last week to
pay the Soviets some 12 billion marks (about $7.5 billion) to
finance their troop withdrawal from East Germany. West German
officials increased the size of the aid to send a clear
message that they intended to accept the responsibilities of
their growing international role.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Without doubt, a Germany that has 17 million more
inhabitants (raising its population to nearly 80 million)
will have greater weight -- politically and economically,"
said West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher in
an interview shortly before Mr. Kohl announced his decision.
"The future will show what is already clear now -- that the
unification of Germany doesn't create a problem but rather
that it helps to solve other problems."
   Bonn's decision to provide more money for the Gulf,
however, was as much a response to international pressure as
a considered strategy. A wide range of political agreements
with the Soviet Union in recent weeks have left critics
wondering whether Bonn wasn't forgetting other obligations.
   West Germany still won't send combat troops to the Gulf,
citing constitutional restrictions, but it has compensated
with a string of other measures. It will provide 1.6 billion
marks in direct financial help to the U.S. and a billion
marks for military equipment including vehicles, radio
equipment, water tankers, cranes and equipment to protect
soldiers against chemical attack. West Germany also will
provide aid to countries that have been hardest-hit by the
trade embargo and the resultant flood of refugees: 400
million marks in aid to Egypt, 200 million marks to Jordan
and 110 million marks to Turkey.
   Many countries now appear eager to accept a more
influential Germany. The end of the Cold War, Soviet economic
decline and the growing U.S. budgetary constraints have left
many countries in the world knocking on Bonn's door for
assistance.
   Soviet officials, who are betting on Germany's assurances,
have made Germany's political ascendance all the more certain
by proposing that the country, after its unification on Oct.
3, become the sixth permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council. Germany should return to world politics as
a "modern great power," said Nikolai Portugalov, the German
affairs adviser to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The rapid changes of recent months have left Mr. Genscher,
the world's longest-serving foreign minister (16 years), with
the task of designing policies to maximize his country's
influence while reducing any apprehensions about a resurgent
Germany. In a wide-ranging interview in his office next to
the Rhine, talking over the sound of cargo ships passing by
the window, he coined a phrase to describe the evolving
approach: "policy by example."
   "Setting an example is the opposite of striving for
power," he said, musing about the future with five
journalists from five countries.
   In outlining his priorities, Mr. Genscher said Germany
would "set an example" in the following ways:
   -- European Union: He wants his neighbors to think more
about European integration and worry less about German power.
Mr. Genscher's goal is still to create a common European
currency at the same time as a single European market,
despite recent reservations expressed by West Germany's
central bank president and finance minister. "We won't get
all the advantages of the power of a single market if we all
have different economic, currency and finance policies," said
Mr. Genscher. He said West Germany's economic miracle never
could have happened if not for the decision of the three
Western occupying powers in 1948 to create a single currency
for their occupation zones. Mr. Genscher said he would
campaign for the establishment of a European Central Bank in
Frankfurt.
   -- Eastern Europe: He said Germany, with its Western
partners, would endeavor to prevent new economic divisions
from replacing the old ideological divisions. However,
Western diplomats say Mr. Genscher is unhappy that other
countries haven't provided more in the way of financing. "We
don't want to monopolize policies toward Eastern Europe," he
said.
   -- The U.S.: Perhaps as early as October, Mr. Genscher
would like European Community foreign ministers to work out a
"trans-Atlantic declaration" with the U.S. It would be a
statement of principles, not unlike the one reached between
the Soviet Union and Germany early this year, that would
define the European-U.S. relationship for the future. Its
intention also would be to focus Washington more on ties with
the European Community instead and not just individual
countries.
   -- The Soviet Union: Mr. Genscher derides those who still
harbor any suspicions about Bonn's relationship with the
Soviet Union or unduly question the large amounts of aid the
country has been willing to pay to gain Moscow's agreement to
unification and troop withdrawal. He said Western officials
who have worried that Germany would sell out to the Soviet
"have grown gray and retired." He cautioned against
continuing to view Europe politically in terms of East and
West. "We have to be careful when looking into the future not
to use yesterday's vocabulary," he says.
   Does Mr. Genscher fear that his vision of Germany and its
role in a unified Europe might be lost if he disappears from
the scene? He's confident Bonn's policies will be continued.
Pointing to opinion polls that consistently rank him the most
popular of West German politicians, he says: "It isn't
because of my good looks."

   May Be to Freeze It Cryogenically

   If you thought caring for your compact disks required only
common sense, brace yourself.
   After nearly two years of study, some of the nation's
premier audiophiles are declaring that the way to get the
most out of your CDs may be to freeze them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   No ordinary freezer will do, however. To improve the sound
of a CD, it must be frozen -- cryogenically, in liquid
nitrogen -- at temperatures approaching minus 320 degrees
fahrenheit.
   "It makes CDs sound better," said Larry Archibald,
publisher of Stereophile, an monthly magazine on high-end
audio equipment. Mr. Archibald said Stereophile will publish
a major article in its October issue on freezing CDs
cryogenically.
   "You just don't know why it works," he said, "but you can
hear the difference."
   Whether you can hear the difference or not, it isn't
advisable to try freezing CDs in your own home. "You can't
just take a disk and throw it into a pool of liquid
nitrogen," said Edmund Meitner, executive vice president of
Museatex Audio Inc., a company in Montreal, Canada that will
shortly offer a CD-freezing service. "If you did that, your
CD would probably crack."
   The key is to gradually reduce the temperature, "so that
you bring about changes in the structure of {the CD's}
materials, said Jeffrey Levine, president of Applied
Cryogenics Inc., a Newton, Mass. company that formed a
partnership with Musetax last month to market the technique.
   Mr. Levine, who holds a doctorate in physics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said methodically
freezing a CD does it no harm provided that "you carefully
bring it back to ambient temperatures." He said that over the
past two years he has honed his method of freezing and
thawing CDs.
   The idea that cryogenics improves the sound of CDs is only
the latest in a string of seemingly kooky claims issued this
year by audiophiles frustrated with what they contend are the
CD's aesthetic shortcomings. In February, an article in
Stereophile unleashed a torrent of interest by claiming that
applying Armor All Protectant or a slew of other surface
treatments noticeably improved the sound of every CD. Before
long, thousands of people around the country -- judging from
letters to audio magazines and the subsequent articles and
television reports -- were painting their CDs with all manner
of coatings.
   "Boy, have I received letters with suggestions for
treating CDs," Sam Tellig, the author of the article, wrote
in Stereophile's current issue. "Everything from guitar
polish to toothpaste and suntan lotion to Liquid Wrench. No,
I do not recommend that you treat your discs with Colgate or
Crest."
   But in recent months, the hoopla over painting CDs has
cooled, and enthusiasm has turned into loathing as angry
musiclovers report that certain treatments ruined their CDs.
Even Mr. Tellig has been stung by the backlash. Partly out of
frustration with the complaints, he has abandoned his monthly
column, soberly advising in a reputed farewell article: "I
want to emphasize that anything you apply to a CD could turn
out to have unforseen and unwanted consequences."
   Privately, though, Mr. Tellig remains convinced that many
treatments, including Armor All, probably don't hurt CDs at
all -- and improve the sound. "The differences are real," he
said in an interview. "Almost anything you do to treat a CD,
even a bath in dishwater, will improve the sound. . . . This
isn't just a mass hysteria."
   Still, even Mr. Tellig was taken aback by the claim that
cryogenics can improve CD sound. "That's a new one on me," he
said.
   Dennis A. Praegitzer, president of 303 Products Inc., a
company in Redding, Calif. that makes liquid treatments to
protect metals, plastics, fiberglass and CDs, says "That's a
lot of crap. I just don't see what freezing would do."
   But for passionate audiophiles, explanations aren't highly
valued. "Anything is possible," said Mark Brannan, manager of
The Audio Alternative, a Portland, Ore. store that advises
its CD customers to paint their disks with a blue-green art
pen in order to improve the sound.
   "I didn't believe the pen deal when I first heard about it
either," Mr. Brannan said. "But it works. We can't explain
it. We don't care." He added that he would keep an open mind
about claims for freezing CDs cryogenically.
   Even if freezing a CD does improve its sound, it isn't
likely that the average living room will end up with a
cryogenic freezer plopped next to the stereo speakers.
Applied Cryogenics sells its freezers for $35,000; buyers are
usually precision manufacturers of one sort or another.
   Indeed, Mr. Meitner hopes to persuade manufacturers of CDs
to add cryogenic freezing to their ordinary procedures. But
so far, no one's jumping at the opportunity. "The music
industry is taking a wait-and-see attitude," he concedes.
   Some audiophiles are less patient. Stereophile, for
instance, plans to offer cryogenically frozen test-CDs for
sale to its subscribers next month. At $8.95 a pop, Mr.
Archibald, the magazine's publisher, thinks its a good deal.
"Listening," he said, "is the only way to find out if this is
real."
   Among audiophiles, resentment against CDs has been growing
for years, stoked by claims that the CD offers "perfect"
sound. Actually, they don't and in many cases are inferior to
plain-old vinyl records, audiophiles contend. "Vinyl has
certain superiorities -- a more living, breathing
reproduction," said Sallie Reynolds, editorial director of
Absolute Sound, an audio magazine. "It preserves more of the
envelope of sound than the CD." Among other flaws, CDs "have
trouble getting a good string sound . . . and lose the sound
of a plugged bass," Ms. Reynolds said, adding: "So far, no
one has made a CD that can reproduce a full, rich orchestra
the way a well-produced {long-playing record} can."
   Cryogenics is best known as the method used to preserve
the bodies of dead people until cures for their illnesses are
discovered. Skeptics of this procedure abound.
   Rather than experiment with "tweaks," Mr. Tellig said he'd
prefer it if manufacturers simply produced a better-sounding
CD. "I think it's disturbing that these tweaks make a
difference," he said. "The customer shouldn't have to go
through these gyrations."

   Parker Hannifin Sees Fiscal '91 Gains
   Despite Gulf Crisis, Uncertain Economy

   CLEVELAND -- Parker Hannifin Corp. expects to increase
sales and earnings in fiscal 1991 despite the Middle East
crisis and the current economic uncertainty, Paul G.
Schloemer, president and chief executive officer, said.
   "There's more pessimistic conversation around than there
was a few months ago, but we haven't seen an appreciable
change in the order book," he said in an interview.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year ended June 30, 1990, the producer of motion
control products for industrial and aerospace uses earned
from continuing operations $110.4 million, or $2.26 a share,
on sales of $2.45 billion. Net income was $111.5 million, or
$2.28 a share.
   Despite the relatively optimistic outlook, Parker Hannifin
this fiscal year will be channeling more of its cash flow
into stock buy-backs and less into plant and equipment
spending, Mr. Schloemer said.
   Parker's domestic orders for industrial products, the
company's best barometer of U.S. economic activity, rose 7%
in July from a year earlier, he said. In August they trailed
year-earlier levels by about 1%, which he said he doesn't
regard as significant. The company produces more than 200,000
different products for hydraulic, pneumatic and
electromechanical motion control in a wide range of
businesses, giving Parker a good feel for general economic
activity.
   Certain U.S. markets, such as parts for construction
machinery and heavy trucks, are weak, Mr. Schloemer said. And
there's less optimism about an imminent upturn in those
businesses than there was a few months ago. But Parker's
orders for some other industrial products, auto parts and
aerospace products have increased, he said.
   Orders continue to rise in most overseas markets, Mr.
Schloemer said. The rate of order increase is slowing a
little in Europe, he said, but that appears to be the result
of capacity constraints at plants Parker supplies rather than
a drop in demand for the end products. "And Brazil is right
back on track," he said, following a period earlier this year
when the Brazilian government's efforts to fight inflation
greatly reduced economic activity.
   Parker Hannifin directors last month authorized repurchase
of as many as three million common shares, about 6% of the 49
million shares outstanding, Mr. Schloemer said. The company
doesn't expect to complete the repurchases in fiscal 1991,
however, he said.
   Capital spending will decline to the $80 million to $85
million range, he said, from $125 million in fiscal 1990 and
$149 million in 1989. "We've been spending at a rather high
rate, and have built a lot of new plants," Mr. Schloemer
said. As a result, the company has adequate capacity for most
products, and its plants are modern and efficient, he said.
   Both the 1991 stock repurchases and capital spending will
be financed with internally generated cash flow, he said. In
fact, the company expects to continue to reduce its debt this
year, he added.
   "In the short term, we have decided that the best thing to
do with our capital is to repurchase some of our stock," Mr.
Schloemer said. Parker Hannifin stock has been trading
recently at $23 to $24 a share, down more than 25% from its
52-week high of $32.75.
   Mr. Schloemer said the more conservative investment
approach isn't a reflection on management's expectations for
the 1990s. He said the company is optimistic about the coming
decade. But this year sales aren't booming and the company
can invest less in facilities and still meet anticipated
demand for its products. Parker probably will be investing
more aggressively in the future to expand and upgrade
facilities, he said.
   Parker has increased the dividend for each of the past 34
years, and the board is likely to continue that tradition,
Mr. Schloemer said. The company's policy is to pay out about
one-third of earnings in dividends, he said. The current rate
is 23 cents quarterly, an increase of two cents a share from
the 21 cents paid in each of the first two quarters of fiscal
1990.

   Manager's Journal:
   Advice From an Office Temp, On Her Own Time
   ----

<LP>
   I am a temp. When I arrive promptly at 9 a.m. at the
address my agency gave me, the person to whom I am supposed
to report is often not in yet. I don't mind at all, since I
bill from when I get there. Sometimes I'm given an
orientation of the office; most of the time I am not. The
better secretaries leave a note for me. These notes vary in
usefulness, but are always better than no note at all.
Frankly, most offices haven't got a clue as to what I need to
make my work cost-effective. Many don't even know what to
expect from a temp.
   Here are the picky-little things I need to do my one- to
two-week job well, things that anyone with an iota of common
sense could come up with, but, alas, never does:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- Maps -- Buildings have floor plans, and I need one of
the department. Who sits where? I won't need (and don't want)
a detailed plan of the whole building, but running from desk
to desk reading names off of memos -- upside down, of course
-- to find out who's who is not very efficient. Also, when
hand-delivering messages it is helpful to know that "Fred" is
female and "A Boy Named Sue" grew up and now heads sales.
   -- Phones -- The extensions should be clearly marked with
the names and numbers. A memo listing "x 124-A. Dahl, x
125-M. Smith" is useless. Most calls are for "Ann," not "Ms.
Dahl." Equally useless is an out-of-date phone listing.
Ideally have two lists in no less than 12-point type -- one
alphabetized by first names and the other by surnames. A temp
doesn't need details for all 30,000 people world-wide in
12-point type, but please have that directory nearby.
   Make clear the ring protocol. Does the temp pick up on the
first ring? The third? When do phones bounce and where do
they go? Or come from? If you're on the other line, is the
temp supposed to intercom you, hold all calls, or run to your
office with a name on a note? Do you prefer being "not at
your desk" or "in a meeting?"
   If your phones have multiple-city extensions (great for
hooking up several small offices) and your temp is going to
have to do relatively complicated maneuvers, you all had
better practice a few times -- and keep your humor.
   -- Stationery -- I keep hoping that someday someone will
leave me a sample of all the different types of stationery
and memo paper, along with instructions on what goes on what
and how many spaces down I have to go with the date to not
print over the letterhead. I can dig around, but not everyone
I work for has personalized letterhead tucked under the
regular letterhead. I would appreciate knowing that paper for
inter-office memos exists before I set one up on regular memo
paper. Post-its are essential.
   -- Annual Report -- A 50% chance I'll need other offices'
addresses, the president's name, all stuff within. Ideally,
I'll find a green pen so you can recognize my notes. When I'm
really organized I bring one.
   Here are the things your temp should (and shouldn't) do:
   -- Filing -- Do not have your temp file anything more
involved than correspondence into a three-ring chronological
folder. Two reasons: 1) the full-time person should look at
the stuff to know what went on; 2) things that can get lost
will get lost, especially if they are lost in a computer hard
drive and named something interesting. Even chronological
correspondence files can be a problem if there's one for
department memos, one for corporate memos, howeverall you
break it down. On the other hand, one-of-a-kind filing
projects are a very good temp task because there is no system
to learn or to damage.
   -- Errands -- Most temps love errands. I've shopped for
everything from costumes for a sales meeting to a
refrigerator. I'll get great pastries on my way in and drop
off Fed-Ex on my way home (all billable hours, of course). I
love being a messenger on nice days.
   -- Typing/Word Processing -- I give word-processed
documents to my boss with hand-written proofing marks,
explaining: "I find this the fastest way, since there are
usually changes and I hate wasting paper." No one has ever
disagreed.
   Most of the stuff I'm asked to type has lots of little
tense problems, is redundant, and then, to make certain that
the point is made, is redundant again. (Young men are the
worst and young women, though only marginally better, are
territorial. Young engineers are clearer.)
   -- Working with computers (PCs) -- Don't have your temp
hired for word processing do interesting document
manipulations on the first day. There are too many variations
in the programs and temp agencies don't screen us that
carefully. (I go on jobs that will require software I've
never touched because my agency knows I will figure it out
pretty quickly.) Even when I know the software, the keyboard
is different, the memory is more or less, or somebody
customized something.
   Don't let your temp loose in the hard drive. Either start
a C:/Temp file or have an empty, formatted "Temp" disk for
the full-timer to review and file upon return.
   Very seldom can I turn on a computer and figure out
someone's filing system, primarily because not many people
are well organized. If you might need a price-quote update or
want a proposal altered, make certain you know what it's
called and where it is: It could take me a day or two to find
it, and I'm a better-than-average temp.
   -- Working with computers (mainframes, minis) -- Most
proprietary software is user-antagonistic and often the
budget priorities changed before the user manual was written.
Yet since I have been hired to do word processing -- a
computer thing -- I am expected to be fluent on all computer
things. On any proprietary system I have used, even simple
procedures -- such as processing a check request -- take me
three supervised times before I catch on: once -- total
darkness; twice -- vague familiarity; thrice -- minimum
competence. If it is only done a couple of times a week, just
farm it out to another secretary; it is not worth teaching a
temp.
   For date entry or form-filling ventures, break it into
steps as much as possible. Do not have your temp uploading
data onto a proprietary system or running the analytics the
first day.
   -- Photocopying -- I hate it mostly because I jam
machines. But reams of photocopying is a good, safe temp
chore -- although not one worth $20 to $25 per hour. Most
temps like photocopying because your boss can't hassle you
when you're miles away at the copier.
   My boss at a large retailer -- now brushing against
Chapter 11 -- hired temps to make extra copies of all reports
so that she would always be able to find one someplace if all
the others got lost. (This departmental system was logical
relative to the company's international communications
methods.)
   -- Travel Arrangements -- I will not know what you like
and where your price cut-off point is. Call the agent
yourself; it will be faster.

   Ms. Peterson is delighted that she never made enough money
as a temp to buy a highly mortgaged co-op in Manhattan.

   FRANCHISERS BANKROLL franchisees for expansion and faster
growth.
   When Connie Hart, operator of a temporary-services
franchise in Syracuse, N.Y., couldn't get banks to finance
her purchase of another temporary agency, her own franchiser,
Uniforce Temporary Personnel Inc., chipped in. The New Hyde
Park, N.Y., operator of temporary services agencies gave Ms.
Hart $40,000, about 50% of the acquisition price, without any
repayment required. This year, Uniforce gave Ms. Hart another
$40,000 for a second acquisition that boosted her franchise's
total revenue to $3.4 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Uniforce, which receives 45% of the gross profits of its
franchisees, figures that the increase in Ms. Hart's revenue
and the economies of scale of running a larger agency has
more than paid back its $80,000 expenditure.
   "Putting the money in ourselves is a more economic
proposition," contends John Fanning, president of Uniforce.
"It allows for rapid growth and it doesn't saddle a
fast-growing franchisee with onerous debt." Uniforce spent
about $5 million on this financing program in the past 12
months and plans to double such expenditures in the year
ahead.
   Besides Uniforce, such franchisers as Jiffy Lube
International Inc., Baltimore, and Medicine Shoppe
International Inc., St. Louis, are directly funding the
expansion of their franchisees. Among other reasons,
small-business franchisees are having a frustrating time
trying to raise money in the present credit market.
   Says Mr. Fanning: "The current economic climate makes this
a very viable program."

   A NEW WAY to finance technology research is encountering
resistance.
   When small biotechnology companies -- such as Alza Corp.,
Centocor Inc. and Immunex Corp. -- last year raised research
capital through a new kind of stock offering,
corporate-finance specialists predicted an avalanche of
similar offerings.
   The financing vehicle involves selling stock in a spinoff
designed to develop a technology or products, instead of
selling stock in the parent company. As it allows companies
to finance longer-term research without reducing profits, it
seemed a logical fund-raising method for the hundreds of
cash-strapped technology companies.
   But since the first three such offerings, few companies
have followed suit. Investment bankers say they know of only
one other -- by Genzyme Corp., Boston -- that is actively
being planned.
   The offerings looked good when the stock market was strong
and technology stocks were underpriced, says Parag Saxena,
managing director of the health-care fund at Chancellor
Investment Management Inc., New York. But with the recent
stock-market weakness, he contends, the attraction has
dimmed.
   "Many companies aren't familiar with the financing
instrument," says Mark Simon, a biotechnology analyst with
Robertson &amp; Stephens, San Francisco. And because many
institutional investors haven't fully understood the
financing mechanism, "investment banks themselves have been
slow in offering it," he says. He thinks the strategy's
virtues were oversold.
   "It is only useful if a company has a defined program or
technology that is distinct from what the parent is doing,"
he explains.
   ---
   VENTURE CAPITAL for female entrepreneurs continues to be
elusive.
   Even though women now start an estimated two-thirds of all
new businesses each year, they receive less than 5% of all
venture-capital funds, says Des Moines, Iowa, venture
capitalist Jennifer Wilson. There are few signs things are
changing.
   Since the middle of 1989, Ms. Wilson has been trying to
raise $20 million for her Sky Venture Capital Fund to invest
in start-ups by women. But so far she has managed to obtain
less than $100,000.
   While all rookie venture capitalists are having a hard
time raising money, a fund directed at female entrepreneurs
seems to get a particularly chilly response. "Venture
advisers tell me there is no need for a fund that targets
women. They argue that venture capitalists never discriminate
on the basis of sex," Ms. Wilson says.
   Nevertheless, few venture firms have invested in concerns
run by women. The most successful examples, such as ASK
Computer Systems, Mountain View, Calif., and Lillian Vernon
Inc., Mount Vernon, N.Y., succeeded entirely on their own.
   Ms. Wilson concedes that many of the small businesses
launched by women, like most other small businesses, aren't
candidates for venture capital. But, "women as
entrepreneur/managers are an untapped resource," she
contends. "They've proven themselves not just in traditional
service businesses and retailing but in technology and
medical sciences."
   Since word got out about Ms. Wilson's proposed fund, more
than a hundred women have contacted her. Among their new
business ideas: new products for the veterinary market, an
exercise device for the physically disabled, and a treatment
for cellulite.
   ---
   AN INNER-CITY business development concern tries a
different approach.
   The Council for Equal Business Opportunity Inc.,
Baltimore, is joining with small minority businesses to
develop joint ventures with larger local corporations. CEBO's
approach to helping minority businesses not only will
generate revenue for local businesses but also new jobs,
contends Michael A. Gaines Sr., executive director of the
Council. Most of the past efforts by CEBO, a nonprofit
Baltimore concern, were focused on providing technical and
management assistance to minority-owned businesses.
   CEBO and its minority-owned partners recently signed a
joint-venture agreement with Orlando Group Inc., a Baltimore
computer concern, to develop software facility management
systems for local colleges and universities, especially those
with large minority enrollments. CEBO and its partners are
negotiating with a big electronics manufacturer to help
design and expand its manufacturing facilities.
   CEBO says it won't compete with for-profit businesses but
will help them train workers in science and technology. "Part
of our business development efforts are aimed at spotting
areas that are underserved and helping local businesses plug
those gaps," says Mr. Gaines.
   The ventures will greatly increase revenues for CEBO,
which has about 20 employees and an operating budget of $1
million.

   Excerpts from former President Ronald Reagan's address

<TEXT>
   A little over 200 years ago, two Polish patriots helped us
in America make our world anew. My country had just been
born. Its guiding idea was that men and women could govern
themselves, free of foreign domination or influence. A
skeptical world said the experiment would fail, but that did
not deter these two men who had already struggled against
foreign domination here in Poland.
   Thus it was that a brilliant engineer, Thaddeus Kosciusko,
and a daring cavalry commander, Casimir Pulaski, joined the
American War of Independence and performed heroic deeds. They
were among those who made it possible for the fragile flower
of democracy to survive and bloom in American soil.
   Now, thousands of patriots have been making the world anew
once again. I am speaking of all of you here, the men and
women of Solidarity who, in just 10 years since the founding
of your movement, have brought about the end of communism's
stifling embrace.
   You have restored Polish independence from outside
influence. You have successfully led the struggle for free,
open and democratic elections. You have paved the way for a
market economy to replace the failed efforts of centralized
planning and control. You have triggered vast changes in the
political map of Central and Eastern Europe. One might say
this is the shipyard that launched a half dozen revolutions]
   Today, Solidarity leads the Polish government and the
people -- and it all began here 10 years ago. Those 10 years
brought hardship and heartache for most of you. To some it
brought death. It brought obstacles and reversals. But you
never lost hope. You stand as proof of the basic human truth
that when men and women thirst for freedom and democracy,
their thirst will not be quenched until their goal is
achieved. You of Solidarity have now achieved it.
   But the goal of freedom and democracy was only the first
goal to be achieved -- a prelude to something even greater:
the rejuvenation of your country. You began that process with
a bold move on the first of January this year. You eliminated
price controls and most subsidies. You replaced the old
communist credit system with a monetary system. So far there
are a number of positive results:
   -- You stopped inflation in its tracks and have rolled it
back.
   -- Your stores are filled with goods today and there are
no more long lines.
   -- The black market is a memory.
   -- Most important for your future foreign trade, you have
created the first convertible currency in the former
Communist Bloc of countries.
   With the bold economic moves you knew there would be some
pain. We have a saying, "no pain, no gain."
   Still, pain is pain if your buying power has declined or
you are out of work. In the U.S. we believe strongly in
people helping people. This time, it is our turn to help the
new Poland. Here are a few examples:
   -- Since July, 29 containers of medical supplies from U.S.
Department of Defense stocks in Europe have been delivered to
Polish hospitals, orphanages and old people's homes. The
shipments were organized by a U.S. citizens' group, the
Emergency Committee for Aid to Poland.
   -- Early this year, at the request of your Ministry of
Labor, the same U.S. committee arranged for American
corporations to contribute 50 tons of specialized infant
formula.
   -- In June, 60 volunteers from the U.S. Peace Corps
arrived to teach English.
   -- Soon, mid-level managers of Polish business enterprises
will be able to learn the latest marketing and management
practices at a special exchange program at New York
University, organized by the Institute for East-West Business
Dynamics, a non-profit U.S. group.
   -- In Cracow, Project Hope, the principal U.S. sponsor of
the American Children's Hospital there, is nearing completion
of a large ambulatory care center. In the course of its
16-year-old program here in Poland, Project Hope has
sponsored visits by nearly 500 Polish medical professionals
to the U.S. and visits to Poland by more than 1,600 of Hope's
volunteer health-care specialists. And, for the past two
years, Project Hope's health economists and policy analysts
have worked closely with your Ministry of Health in
developing plans for reform of the health-care delivery
system.
   Just as long as help is wanted, Americans will be there to
provide it. In the long run, however, it is you, the people
of Poland, who will solve your economic problems through
self-help.
   I have had a little experience in the matter of economic
growth, so I hope you won't mind if I share with you some of
what I've learned.
   First, there are two schools of thought about how to
achieve lasting economic health and growth. One believes you
get it only through severe austerity and belt-tightening. The
other believes you achieve it by getting government out of
the way so that the people themselves can create and find
opportunities. I confess that I side with that second school
of thought, the one that believes in incentives for growth.
We used that approach when my administration took office and
it is still working under President Bush's leadership.
   You have done away with price controls, for they create
false shortages and inhibit growth. Wage controls thwart
growth, too. Do away with wage controls and the more
efficient, growth-minded businesses will pay more, attract
good people and keep on growing. Inefficient enterprises will
either wither and die or find ways to become competitive.
   Ownership is another great incentive for economic growth.
If you own your own business you will work hard to make it do
well. If your customers are satisfied with your goods and
services, they will come back. Thus, there is the closest of
connections between the effort you put into it and the
rewards you get out of it.
   Western banks might find it worthwhile to take a good look
at including in their plans a fund for lending to small
start-up businesses here in Poland. I understand that there
is quite a lot of what we call "mattress money" tucked away.
If you put a little credit together with a little mattress
money, you could open up a great many bakeries, butcher
shops, small factories and repair services all over Poland.
   The privatization bill recently enacted by your government
will reduce the number of state monopolies, and that is good,
for they will be replaced by enterprises that must be
competitive. As inefficient ones are scaled down or closed,
however, the challenge is to find new jobs for workers laid
off.
   Your current level of unemployment, 5.2%, would not be
very worrisome in the West. We have "safety nets," consisting
of unemployment compensation insurance, retraining programs
and employment placement services for workers who are laid
off. I understand the U.S. Department of Labor is working
with your Ministry of Labor to create a similar safety net
for Polish workers.
   Meanwhile, what about the workers in those state
monopolies that are being put up for sale? I am reminded of a
technique for employee ownership that has worked well for
many U.S. companies. It goes by various names, but the best
known is "Employee Stock Ownership Program," or ESOP. With
such a program, the employees create a trust which borrows
money from a bank to buy shares of stock in the company. The
loan is paid back over several years from the employees'
share of the company's profits.
   How can they be sure the company will be profitable? The
workers, as owners, make sure by insisting that unprofitable
or obsolete products be replaced by new ones; that operating
costs be kept down; and that new efficiencies of operation
are adopted. When a person owns assets he or she will look
after them.
   When people believe in something, they can make it work.
Just as a pair of Polish patriots helped America make the
seeds of its democracy flower, so you of Solidarity have
planted those same seeds in Poland. You have nurtured them
and seen them grow. Now, you have it within you to make them
blossom far, far into the future and to bring renewed vigor
to your nation.

   On your Oct. 18, 1989, editorial page there was a
satirical article by former Secretary of the Navy John
Lehman, entitled "In the Pentagon, the Undead Walk." In it,
Mr. Lehman criticized President Reagan and Secretary of
Defense Weinberger for actions they took to better prepare us
to respond to Middle East contingencies such as establishing
the Rapid Deployment Force and placing stocks of ammunition
and equipment on pre-positioned ships in the Indian Ocean.
These preparations have been invaluable to our military
during the current Iraqi crisis. We could not have responded
as rapidly as we did without them.
   Mr. Lehman made the same mistake as many military leaders
in the 1980s. They were so focused on the Soviet Central
Europe threat that they failed to perceive the other
potential threats to our security. As a result, much of the
defense buildup in the past decade is oriented solely to a
Soviet threat and not of great value to us in the current
situation in the Middle East, such as submarines and nuclear
missiles.

   The U.S. is picking up important new military and
financial commitments from other countries in the campaign to
drive Iraq out of Kuwait, partly because of a major Iraqi
miscalculation that brought France more strongly into the
military equation.
   At the same time, President Bush directly warned the Iraqi
people that war might be the result of the showdown with
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. In a taped message to Iraq,
aired last night on Iraqi TV, Mr. Bush declared that Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait had put the nation "on the brink of war."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bush added: "Perhaps your leaders do not appreciate
the strength of the forces united against them. Let me say
clearly there is no way Iraq can win. Ultimately, Iraq must
withdraw from Kuwait. No one -- not the American people, not
this president -- wants war. But there are times when a
country, when all countries who value the principles of
sovereignty and independence, must stand against aggression."
   Even as the military preparations and talk of military
action accelerated, though, Bush administration officials
involved in managing the crisis now believe that it will be
November at the earliest before Saddam Hussein begins to
consider withdrawing from Kuwait, even if the trade embargo
against Iraq and diplomatic pressure work well. And it could
be December before that goal can be achieved through economic
and diplomatic pressure, they believe.
   The current U.S. strategy is to refrain from a military
assault as long as the sanctions keep working -- even after
U.S. military forces reach full strength in November.
   But officials concede privately that any signs of wavering
on the embargo, or of willingness to compromise -- such as
Iran's recent verbal attacks on the U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia -- could slow the process, as Saddam Hussein probes
for any fissures in the international effort that he can
exploit. The longer the standoff stretches out, the harder it
will be to hold together the sprawling anti-Iraq coalition.
   Thus, the U.S., France and the U.S.S.R. are discussing new
United Nations sanctions to punish countries that break the
embargo, especially by air. Presumably, these nations would
face some of the sanctions that have been issued against
Iraq. One possible penalty would be suspension of landing
rights for their national airlines. The ambassadors of the
five permanent U.N. Security Council members met yesterday to
begin shaping further resolutions, and U.S. officials said
there might be U.N. action as early this week to slap
penalties on embargo-busters.
   In just the past few days, five countries agreed to new
military deployments to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region to
join more than 100,000 American soldiers and sailors already
there. And others have pledged billions of dollars in funds
for the effort.
   France, enraged after Iraqi troops broke into one of its
buildings in Kuwait and seized diplomats Friday, agreed to
add a 4,000-man light-armored brigade with aircraft to its
forces in the Gulf. U.S. officials were puzzled by the Iraqi
moves against the French diplomats, and others from Belgium,
Canada and the Netherlands, which they regard as a major
miscalculation that only bolstered the anti-Iraq coalition.
   The fallout from the raids on diplomatic premises is
becoming more widespread. The U.N. Security Council yesterday
unanimously condemned the incursions, the Soviet Union
criticized them and Italy expelled some employees of the
Iraqi embassy there.
   In moves that were in the works even before the Iraqi
moves against diplomatic buildings in Kuwait, Britain said it
would dispatch a 6,000-man armored brigade and a third
squadron of fighter jets to the Persian Gulf. Canada and
Italy each announced the deployment to the Gulf of their
first jet fighter squadrons. Egypt said it is ready to send
up to two divisions of ground troops and Syria has pledged a
division of at least 10,000 men with roughly 300 tanks.
   In addition to the political importance of the French and
British decision to send additional forces, U.S. military
officials also welcomed the moves for more practical reasons.
Delays by Syria and Egypt in sending promised tanks and
soldiers have concerned U.S. commanders for several weeks,
and they hope to use European forces to plug certain holes in
the defensive barrier in northern Saudi Arabia.
   West Germany, while not sending combat forces, is handing
over to the U.S. about $1 billion of new military gear,
including military vehicles, 60 special tanks equipped to
resist chemical and nuclear attack, combat-support and
communications equipment.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also pledged about $1
billion in support for Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, bringing the
German total to $2 billion. The European Community is also
expected to announce shortly a financial commitment
approaching $2 billion.
   Mr. Kohl said "I regret very much" that Germany's
constitution doesn't permit it to send troops to the Gulf. He
pledged to try to change that law in early 1991, after
Germany is reunited and has held elections.
   "The buildup is still going on. It's going on for the
purposes the president described," said Brent Scowcroft,
President Bush's national security adviser, on CBS News's
"Face the Nation" yesterday. He added: "We want {Saddam
Hussein} to know we are serious."
   In addition, Secretary of State James Baker claimed that
all eight Arab and European governments he called on during a
10-day, 24,000-mile search for support that ended over the
weekend had signed onto the hard-line U.S. stand. That
posture rules out any compromise with Iraq on the U.N.
resolutions that demand unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait
and restoration of the Kuwaiti government that was ousted by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion.
   "We talked about the preference for a peaceful and
political solution," an exhausted Mr. Baker told reporters in
Bonn, West Germany, the final stop on his tour. "But we have
to understand from the very beginning what we mean by that.
We do not mean walking away from, watering down, or in any
way diminishing the scope and extent of the United Nations
Security Council Resolutions. So, a sine qua non is that Iraq
withdraw, and that the legitimate government of Kuwait be
restored."
   Since Sept. 5, Mr. Baker has crisscrossed three continents
to meet with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Egypt,
Syria, the Soviet Union, Italy, West Germany, North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the EC, as well as the exiled Kuwaiti
leadership.
   The developments left the administration feeling upbeat.
But political criticism at home could still cause the White
House trouble. For one thing, all the new military forces
being sent by other countries are relatively small, leaving
the U.S. still the major country at risk there.
   Also, it's becoming clearer that the administration,
distracted by European and Soviet matters, wasn't tough on
Iraq until after the invasion, and may have missed a chance
to help head it off.
   In particular, a transcript of a crucial meeting that
April Glaspie, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, held with Saddam
Hussein just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait indicates
that she failed to clearly warn Iraq that the U.S. would
strongly oppose an invasion. The transcript was released by
Iraq, but U.S. officials haven't questioned its accuracy.
   But at a news conference in Bonn Saturday night, Mr. Baker
refused to discuss the Glaspie affair, citing the
confidentiality of diplomatic communications.
   Instead, he lashed out at critics of her performance,
calling her "a dedicated public servant who has done a fine
job" and saying it is "ludicrous to somehow suggest that the
United States contributed to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait."
   In his address to the Iraqi people, meanwhile, Mr. Bush
attempted to place the blame for current high tensions
securely on the shoulders of Saddam Hussein, quoting back the
Iraqi leader's own words from a 1988 speech in which he
declared that no Arab nation had the right to occupy another.
In that speech, the Iraqi leader also declared that "if Iraq
should become intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelm
another Arab state, the Arabs would be right to deploy their
armies to check it."
   Mr. Bush said that war isn't "inevitable," but added that
"when conflict is thrust upon us, there is no nation on Earth
with greater resolve or stronger steadiness of purpose."
   Iraqi TV followed Mr. Bush's speech with a longer
commentary of its own saying that many of Mr. Bush's remarks
about the evolution of the current crisis were lies and that
he wants to be "dictator of the whole world."

   Shortage of Scientists Approaches a Crisis
   As More Students Drop Out of the Field

   PITTSBURGH -- It's only 10 minutes into the first day of
class in Chem 11, the University of Pittsburgh's introductory
chemistry course, and student Matt Smith is already yawning.
   Undaunted, Prof. Henry Bent tries a one-liner about
measuring density. Nobody laughs. He explodes a pink balloon
full of hydrogen. Mr. Smith starts jiggling his leg and
reading his mail. The professor shoots a fire extinguisher
into the crowd. Mr. Smith shuts his eyes and slumps in his
seat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sustaining interest among budding scientists is no easy
task nowadays. Mr. Smith, a 20-year-old junior, has already
switched his major from biology to business, forgoing plans
to be a biology teacher. "I couldn't study science because I
didn't enjoy it," he says.
   Mr. Smith isn't alone. Comprehensive statistics on the
subject don't exist, but according to a National Science
Foundation study, some 42% of those who enter college
professing interest in science or engineering careers drop
out of the sciences after freshman year, and another 23%
defect before graduation.
   The dropout problem isn't new. But Robert Watson, the
science foundation's director of undergraduate science,
engineering and mathematics education, says that "certainly
the evidence is it's getting worse." With fewer students
interested in science to begin with and a critical shortage
of scientists and engineers, the attrition rate could soon
represent a national crisis.
   Frustrated faculty members blame their students. High
schools left them ill-prepared for rigorous college science,
the teachers say. Television and video games, meanwhile, gave
them meager technical skills, short attention spans and a
distaste for hard work. "They get here and may genuinely be
interested in science, but they don't have the tools to do
it," says Gary Haller, professor of chemical engineering at
Yale University.
   Students, in turn, blame science professors for using
antiquated teaching methods and draconian grading systems.
They also complain of dry lectures packed with scores of
incomprehensible formulas and illustrated with confounding
diagrams. Science students typically put in more work than
their peers in the humanities or social sciences, and their
labors are often rewarded with substantially lower grades.
   David Weisberg, a junior at Emory University in Atlanta,
entered college as a pre-med major, but after dabbling in
chemistry, biology and mathematics, he transferred to the
business school. "With all that lab work and the time put
forth and for as well as I was doing, it wasn't worth it,"
Mr. Weisberg says. "It shot me down. I was just miserable."
   Michael Chen entered Yale in 1986 planning to study
science like his parents and sister, who are doctors, and his
brother, who is a computer consultant. But then, he took
astrophysics. "It scared the hell out of me," says Mr. Chen.
"I put more work into the weekly problem sets than I did into
midterm and final papers" for other courses.
   Mr. Chen switched his major to English and has since taken
a job in publishing. "In other classes, if you do the work,
you'll get an A," says Mr. Chen. "In science, it just doesn't
work that way."
   "It's an enormous problem," concedes mathematician Uri
Triesman of the University of California at Berkeley. "No one
will follow us unless we make an invitational atmosphere."
   Much of the hostility students perceive in science comes
from the stingy grading. Science professors, notoriously
tight with the A's, commonly grade on a "curve." For every A
awarded, there must be a certain number of D's, regardless of
merit. That leads to fierce competition for the good grades.
Some students refuse to help others prepare for exams and
disparage high achievers for "breaking the curve."
Competition becomes so fierce that students have been known
to steal or sabotage their classmates' lab experiments.
   "It's a great source of pride to science departments that
they have the lowest grades in the college," says William
Coleman, professor of chemistry at Wellesley College and an
advocate of reform. "I don't see why they're proud of that."
   Frightened by low grades, students reject science courses
in favor of history, for example, where an A paper will be
given an A, regardless of how many other A papers are
submitted.
   They also find that they usually don't have to work as
hard for that A in history. On top of lectures, science
students must take time-consuming lab courses -- often for
only partial credit, or for no credit at all. At some
colleges, science majors have to take twice as many required
courses as students in other disciplines.
   Some scientists say today's crisis has its origins in the
post-Sputnik era. Professors had more science enthusiasts
than they could handle in those days, so they devised ways to
"weed out" the less serious. They piled work on their
students and made them compete for high marks. And with an
oversupply of science students, they didn't have to worry
whether their teaching style was inaccessible.
   But now that interest in science careers has waned, the
"weeding out" system has become perilous. "A lot of people
are turned off" from sciences, says Katharine Hanson,
executive director of the Consortium on Financing Higher
Education. "It's just not worth the battle." It doesn't help
that the financial incentives for science careers are less
attractive than those for, say, law or business careers, she
added.
   Some science professors are trying to make their courses
more appealing. Wellesley's Mr. Coleman, for example, has
been having his introductory chemistry students read and
write more about science's social and political relevance. He
threw out the grading curve, so students wouldn't compete
against each other. He also thinks science departments
nationwide could ease requirements without compromising
rigor. But he admits his views are considered radical by many
of his peers.
   Others, trying to fight the lethargy without compromising
the requirements, become entertainers instead of professors.
One organic chemistry professor set his lecture to the tune
"America the Beautiful."
   Another entertainer, however, is about ready to close his
act. "I'm going to be a marine drill sergeant -- I'm not
going to smile until Christmas," threatens Pitt's Mr. Bent, a
40-year teaching veteran.
   "We've pulled out all the stops, and we're still not
getting results," he says, disassembling a toy cannon after
class. "We're having the worst times of our lives now, and
it's getting worse."

   The Vietnamese lesson has borne much "bad" fruit: Iraq,
after having invaded Kuwait, has purely and simply annexed
it. In Kuwait, before its annexation, Iraq did exactly what
Vietnam did in Cambodia on December 1978: massive attacks
using hundreds of tanks, heavy artillery, airplanes and
thousands of infantrymen; a setting up of a puppet
government; the dispatching of settlers; then the so-called
withdrawal of regular forces leaving only "volunteers."
   The difference between the Vietnamese case and that of
Iraq is that Iraq has now annexed Kuwait while Vietnam
continues to try to integrate Cambodia into its "Indochinese
Federation." Vietnam has not yet succeeded, after having
tried for more than 11 years, thanks on the one hand to the
existence of a Cambodian National Resistance under the
leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and on the other to
the firm support of the member nations of ASEAN and other
countries espousing the values of peace and justice.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Vietnamese lesson, well learned by Iraq, gives one
food for thought: The commander in chief of the Royal Thai
Army, during his visit to inspect troops in the eastern
region, has clearly warned them against a "possible
intervention of foreign troops from Cambodia," referring to
the recent Iraqi invasion. On this subject, the deputy prime
minister of Singapore has used language even more firm and
has launched an unequivocal warning. The other nations of the
world, especially those of middle and small size, without
mentioning them, should not be far from sharing the fear.
   Unfortunately, the U.S. and Western Europe (the Common
Market) are heading for a dialogue with Vietnam and a
resumption of aid to this country, which would signify the
acceptance by the Western nations of the Vietnamese fait
accompli in Cambodia. A de facto recognition by the Western
nations and the Western press of the Phnom Penh regime set up
by Vietnamese tanks and carried out through the various forms
of Vietnamese presence would prove to Iraq and others that
acts of aggression will pay off as long as one has the
audacity and patience.
   Is it not a bitter lesson for us, the little and
middle-size states, and equally for those who are friends of
the West?

   Chase Bid to Raise
   Capital in Japan
   Runs Into Snags

   TOKYO -- Investment bankers trying to raise $100 million
in fresh capital for Chase Manhattan Corp. are colliding with
a flood of fund-raising efforts by Japanese banks.
   The U.S. bank holding company is trying to privately place
$100 million in subordinated debt with Japanese leasing
companies, people familiar with the effort said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jayme Garcia Dos Santos, Chase Manhattan Bank's senior
vice president in Tokyo, confirmed that an investment bank
"has offered to raise the money for the {Chase Manhattan}
corporation." A report on the capital-raising effort appeared
in Friday's American Banker. Mr. Garcia said the investment
firm, identified by others as CS First Boston Inc., had been
"sounding the market to make a firm proposal."
   Officials at CS First Boston could not be reached for
comment.
   At least one leasing company initially was interested in
putting up the money and bankers said the company was hoping
to sell the paper to other leasing companies.
   But the other companies apparently showed less enthusiasm
for the deal because it comes in the midst of a huge rush by
Japanese banks to place subordinated debt of their own. "It's
not a hot prospect," one U.S. banker said.
   All international banks are facing pressure to bolster
their capital bases by March 1993, when new international
regulations come into effect requiring banks to maintain
capital roughly equivalent to 8% of their assets. For Chase,
new capital would help it expand beyond that level, since it
currently has a 9.02% ratio.
   Until this year, a booming stock market and a booming,
cash-spinning economy made raising capital an easy task for
Japanese banks. The stock market has since fallen sharply,
though, not only removing a major source of funds from the
banks but wiping out much of the capital they held in the
form of stock.
   As a result, big Japanese banks have been looking
elsewhere for capital. Since July, nearly a dozen banks
either have planned or completed large issues of subordinated
loans.
   Subordinated debt pays higher interest rates than straight
loans and, because it gives its creditors last claim in a
bankruptcy, it can be counted under international standards
as capital.
   Japan's life-insurance and leasing companies have been
buying most of the paper. But their appetite for it is
waning, and one banker said he would be "extremely surprised"
if CS First Boston is able to place subordinated debt for an
American bank such as Chase.
   Chase is finding subordinated paper difficult to arrange.
Another subordinated issue by the bank group in the U.S.
recently was repriced to yield more than 13%, up sharply from
its original yield of 9.66%.

   Your Aug. 10 article "Plaintiffs Strike a Blow for
Shifting Blame for Accidents Caused by Their Own Acts" was
interesting and informative.
   For several years legislative efforts have been made in a
number of states (including my state of Wisconsin) to enact
so-called "Common Knowledge Defense" laws. Reportedly, those
initiatives enjoyed the financial backing of the alcohol and
tobacco industries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Simply stated: If it's "common knowledge" that using a
product can be harmful and a person uses it anyway, the
person is negligent for his or her own safety and is barred
from suing the manufacturer. Without identifying it, the
"Shifting Blame" article covered the subject quite well.
   However, missing from it was the added element of whether
the product is addictive. In the case of alcohol and tobacco,
how important is the fact that children in this country --
from a very early age -- are subjected to daily
"glamorization" of harmful products in print, billboard,
scoreboard and electronic media ads. Is a sub-teenage child,
"hooked" on an addictive substance, responsible for possible
consequences that may be 20, 30 or 40 years in the future?
Where does the "blame" lie?

   Aetna Life Prepares to Play Major Role
   In Managed-Care Health Insurance

   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. is positioning itself to become
"a major player" in the emerging field of managed-care health
insurance, Charles Bell, senior vice president, said.
   The Hartford, Conn., insurer has spent $400 million in the
past five years to develop its managed-care operations. It
now has 2.8 million members in its network of 29 health
maintenance organizations and 125 preferred provider groups.
Aetna ranks second behind Cigna Corp. among the publicly held
insurers that have decided to establish themselves as
significant providers of managed health-care services to
corporations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since the beginning of the year, Aetna has been working to
cement its position in the managed-care field. In January,
Aetna bought Voluntary Hospitals of America's 50% stake in
Partners National Health Plans, a network of HMOs the two
companies began developing in 1985.
   In July, Aetna won Citibank's group health insurance
account. The New York-based bank chose Aetna as the single
insurer for its 53,000 domestic employees and some 1,000
employees abroad. Citibank is one of Aetna's largest
managed-care clients so far. Several major corporations, such
as American Express Co. and Apple Computer Inc., already use
the insurer's HMO network.
   Late last month, Aetna consolidated all its
employee-benefit programs. These include HMO and preferred
provider group, or PPO, networks; traditional fee-for-service
plans; utilization-review systems, and various mental and
substance-abuse programs under the Aetna Health Plans name.
The new name will make it easier to market these various
benefit plans, Mr. Bell, who is in charge of Aetna's managed
health-care operations, said in an interview.
   With a new name and its managed-care network in place,
Aetna is concentrating on refining and improving its
operations, Mr. Bell said.
   Work has started on a new computer system for its 29 HMOs
to ensure that all the plans are accessing patient
information and processing claims in the same manner. This
new system was needed because Aetna acquired about two-thirds
of the HMOs, each with its own way of carrying out these
basic tasks. Aetna said the new system will be completed by
next year.
   During the coming year, Aetna will consolidate its three
utilization-review programs -- one for HMOs, another for PPOs
and a third for indemnity plans -- into a single system.
   Also next year, the insurer will develop
"point-of-service" benefit plans. These plans offer workers
the flexibility of using a preferred provider network, while
combining some of the utilization-control features of an HMO,
Mr. Bell said. Each employee is assigned to a primary-care
physician, who will coordinate all medical care the patient
receives.
   Employees who chose health-care providers within the Aetna
network in certain cities will be reimbursed 100%, while
those who go outside the network will pay deductibles and
some percentage of their health-care costs. Mr. Bell said
these "point-of-service" plans will be set up in at least the
60 largest metropolitan areas by the end of 1991.
   Although he acknowledged that Aetna's HMO business lost
money during the first six months of 1990, Mr. Bell declined
to make a specific forecast for the remainder of the year.
"Given our losses for the first half, it doesn't take a
rocket scientist to figure out that we'll be in the red this
year," he said. But he also said he expects a "major
improvement" in the company's HMO business next year. "We'd
like to get to a break-even position," he said.

   Philadelphia Mart Extends Currency Trade

   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange extended its trading
session to move close to 24-hour trading of foreign currency
options.
   The new hours that began last night will allow traders
around the world to execute trades on foreign currency
options on the exchange for a total of 18 hours a day, or 19
hours during the standard-time portion of the year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Rizzello, senior vice president of the Philadelphia
exchange, says that by going to the longer hours, exchange
officials "hope to bring some of the over-the-counter
currency option business done in Tokyo and in other Far
Eastern financial centers to the exchange."
   The exchange's foreign currency option session now starts
each night, Sunday through Thursday, at 7 p.m. and goes to 11
p.m. The exchange then closes until 12:30 a.m. to reflect the
hour-and-a-half lunch break that Tokyo traders take. Trading
then continues, without interruption, until 2:30 p.m. Once
daylight savings time ends, the evening session will begin at
6 p.m. go to 10 p.m. and then resume at 11:30 p.m.
   Previously, the daylight savings time session would halt
between 11 p.m. and 4.30 a.m.
   "I don't expect to see a huge increase in volume
initially, but as our customers gain knowledge of this avenue
of trading, they will begin to make use of it," says Jack
Regan, a vice president in the derivative products group at
LIT America Inc. in New York. LIT already has a 24-hour
trading desk to service mainly institutional customers around
the world. It trades around the clock by directing orders to
dealers and exchanges in the U.S., Europe and Asia, depending
on the hour.
   Mr. Regan adds that he eventually expects all the major
markets to offer 24-hour trading.
   This is the third time the Philadelphia exchange has
extended its trading hours. In September 1987, the exchange
introduced an evening session to accommodate increasing
demand for foreign currency options from the Far East. In
January 1989, the exchange added an early morning session
starting at 4:30 a.m. to attract European business.
   On its foreign currency trading floor, the exchange trades
options on cash currencies for the Australian dollar, British
pound, Canadian dollar, German mark, European Currency Unit,
French franc, yen and Swiss franc. Total dollar volume daily
on these contracts represents about $2 billion in underlying
value.
   Currency options give their holders the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell currencies at a specific price on
or before a certain date.
   Nicholas Giordano, president and chief executive of the
Philadelphia exchange, said the extended hours that began
last night are intended primarily to reach market users in
Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and other financial
centers in the Pacific Rim.
   Jeffrey Mondschein, managing director for Continental Bank
in Chicago, says he welcomes the longer hours offered by the
exchange. "I run a night desk here until midnight currently,"
he says. "Anything that provides additional liquidity during
the night time hours may be useful." Mr. Mondschein expects
exchanges with extended hours to become more useful to
professional traders who must lay off risk during
non-daylight hours.
   According to the Philadelphia exchange's Mr. Rizzello, the
exchange has considered going to a 24-hour trading day but
sees two significant problems with doing so.
   First, the exchange still needs a period of time to clear
or process trades that have been executed. But Mr. Rizzello
notes, "Someday, there will be `real-time' processing of
trades and that will make 24-hour trading much easier." Mr.
Rizzello also points out there are some hours -- late
afternoon in the Eastern time zone -- when there does not
appear to be very much business being done anywhere in the
world, so it makes little sense for the exchange to be open
then.
   Mr. Rizzello admits that it will take time to develop
substantial business during the longer hours, but he points
out that during periods of active trading, the extended hours
pay off. "On Sunday night after the October 1989 {stock
market} crash, we did 38,000 contracts before the day session
began." He also notes that the exchange is now studying the
possibility of trading options on both German and French
stock indexes during the extended hours.
   "While other exchanges are talking about 24-hour trading,"
says Mr. Giordano, the exchange president, "we are doing it."

   Barry Rubin, in "Arafat's Iraq Debacle," editorial page,
Aug. 24, failed to mention the debacle for those
organizations such as the Peace Now movement that have
pursued the idea of a negotiated "peace process" with the
PLO.
   In its wildest dreams Israel could never hope to meet the
positions held by Kuwait with respect to Iraq and the PLO.
These include internationally recognized boundaries, full
trade relations, no refugee problems, recognition by the
U.N., a practically demilitarized posture (armed forces
1/50th the size of Iraq's) and the same cultural and
religious background. Yet the response to these positions by
Iraq, supported by the PLO, was swift and complete
obliteration of a nation at peace.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since Iraq is within missile, chemical and nuclear range
of Israel, the lesson for Israel is clear: No amount of
peace-loving posturing will bring any security. Rather,
Israel should remain as strong as possible and continue its
policy of offering to negotiate with any Arab organization or
nation that does not have a charter calling for Israel's
destruction.

   KENOVA, W.Va. -- Frances Cisco never used to fear anyone
in this small town. That changed in June as she drove along a
dark road with her 22-year-old daughter.
   Suddenly, a black car raced up alongside them, trying
twice to force them off the road. "I was afraid he was going
to shoot us," says Mrs. Cisco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Finally, the black car veered off into a deserted parking
lot. Mrs. Cisco circled back, got the license plate number,
reported it to police -- and then decided to drop the matter.
"I didn't want to cause any more strife in the community than
there was already," she says.
   The focus of the tension is Ashland Oil Inc.'s refinery in
Catlettsburg, Ky., just across the Big Sandy River from this
town of about 4,000. The refinery, looking like a giant
Erector set with hissing pipes and smoky stacks, has been a
smelly fixture in the valley since the 1920s. It refines
about 2% of the nation's gasoline and is the region's biggest
employer.
   But in May, four area residents won a $10.3 million
nuisance judgment against Ashland after presenting evidence
that its soot had stripped paint off cars, corroded aluminum
siding and ruined family picnics. It was one of several such
suits filed against Ashland in various regional courts asking
some $3 billion in damages.
   The suits, and especially the stunning victory, have split
families, friends and even churches, turning a community
where the hottest topic used to be high-school football into
an ugly battleground.
   On one side are company supporters who fear a loss of
jobs; on the other are residents concerned about health in
the valley. Following the judgment, one resident hung a metal
sign along a thoroughfare proclaiming the town's support for
Ashland.
   Pearl Vonderheide, whose limbs are covered with itchy
sores she claims stem from Ashland's pollution, demanded that
the sign be removed. The mayor intervened and had it taken
down. Now it decorates the supporter's front porch.
   "This is like a civil war," declares Diana Bowen, who says
her involvement in a suit against Ashland has strained her
marriage. Her husband fears that the repercussions could cost
him his job as a laborer in nearby Ceredo. Says Dave Peyton,
a local columnist: "It's a war of words, and it's done more
damage than the court decision. It's a sore that won't heal."
   Ashland has fueled the tensions, broadly hinting that the
verdict, if upheld on appeal, could prompt area industry to
pull up stakes. "Any company that has smoke or odor is liable
for a lawsuit," says Albert Parnell, outside counsel for the
company, which employs about 1,800 people at the refinery. He
says nuisance laws weren't intended to provide people with
smokeless and odorless environments.
   Some litigants have received harassing and threatening
phone calls. Cars and trucks parked outside their homes have
been vandalized. Many, like Mrs. Cisco, complain that they
have been snooped on, snubbed at local stores and gatherings
and threatened. Her incident with the black car occurred as
she returned from videotaping emissions at the refinery.
   A Kentucky air-quality investigator, whose deposition was
used in the recent trial, found a note on his car after a
family outing warning that a bomb might be inside.
   Scores of businesses have sided with Ashland. "Most people
feel the judgment was unfair," says Bob Clyse, a car dealer
in nearby Ironton, Ohio. "Ashland is critical to our area for
employment."
   Ashland supporters have begun wearing bright red T-shirts
emblazoned with "I support Ashland." They've also waved signs
at rallies that say "Poor Health? See a doctor, not a
lawyer]"
   For years, residents lived peacefully with each other --
and pollution -- in Kenova, whose main street includes a
barbershop, pizzeria, post office, funeral home and a few
other stores. Many here have roots dating back generations,
and few ever thought of living elsewhere.
   The area is surrounded by industry, ranging from an
Aristech Chemical Corp. facility to a coke plant operated by
Armco Steel. Railroad cars rumble through town, blanketing
streets with coal dust. On the waterfront, Ashland barges
spit forth fumes as they take on oil for their treks up and
down the Ohio River.
   As a child growing up in Kenova, Mrs. Cisco recalls that
townsfolk often joked that they wouldn't suffer from creaky
joints in old age: The oil seemed so omnipresent, sprayed on
the streets or squeezed out of wash hung outdoors, that
they'd be well lubricated.
   Complaints about the refinery soot started surfacing in
1983. That's when Ashland began processing cheaper, smellier
crude oil with higher contents of sulfur and trace metals.
The company then added special equipment to increase the
amount of gasoline that could be extracted from such crude.
   But the equipment, which Ashland claims is unique in the
domestic oil refining industry and was partly supposed to
filter emissions, had lots of operating problems. Among other
things, the vacuum cleaner-like bags constantly ripped.
Ashland insisted that the dust was harmless.
   Ashland Chairman John R. Hall has said that the refinery
had emission problems in the past, but that such emissions
wouldn't hurt anyone's health. In a 1989 speech, he tried to
demonstrate the safety of the powder residents say makes them
sick. He not only spread some of the gritty brown substance
on his forehead, he also dipped his fingers into a bottle and
tasted it in front of about 100 people. "We do not believe
our operations are adversely affecting the health of any
individual," he said.
   However, during the jury trial in county court in
Charleston, a chemist with the West Virginia air pollution
control commission testified that his tests showed the soot
was nearly as potent as Drano and could burn skin, corrode
metal and pit glass.
   It took Ashland until nearly 1988 to correct the problem
with its insufficient filtering. Kentucky air pollution
authorities also say citations against the refinery have
piled up since 1987; Ashland and the state are trying to
negotiate a settlement.
   "I want to reassure the community that our refinery is
operating safely and in compliance with all government
regulations," Mr. Hall said in a speech after the jury
verdict.
   The residents' lawsuit has led to deep family divisions.
Ronald Walker and his sister, Barbara Christian, haven't
spoken since her family filed a $24 million suit against
Ashland in October 1988. "I don't agree with her decision on
the suit," says Mr. Walker. The operator of a Kenova moving
company, he has instructed his own employees who have suits
against Ashland to avoid going into the homes of Ashland
employees. "I don't want to cause any friction," he says.
   Mrs. Christian, 46, says she's deeply hurt because her
brother hasn't looked at materials she has collected in
support of the family's suit, much less inquired about the
health of one of her sons. Now 18, the boy was once
hospitalized for four days with metals poisoning, which Mrs.
Christian says was due to refinery emissions.
   In February 1989, the boy's doctor said the family should
leave Kenova because of his health problems. They moved to
Huntington, six miles away.
   Mr. Walker admits that he didn't ask about her boy. "He's
been sick off and on for years," he says. "If it was a major
problem, he didn't show it." He also says he doesn't believe
that anyone's health or property has been hurt by refinery
soot. Kenova once was plagued by coal dust, he says. "We
learned to live with it. It was part of the community."
   The suits against Ashland, he says, are "get-rich schemes.
They're a ticket to the lottery. Once they get the money
they'll heal real fast."
   Many residents were shocked that the suit resulted in such
a hefty award. At least 80% of households in the town earn
less than $30,000 a year, and half make less than $20,000.
Donald Fuller, who was awarded $2.8 million by the Charleston
jury, was barraged with nasty phone calls, including one
death threat that he tape-recorded for police. Other callers
accused him of being on welfare.
   Mr. Fuller, who is 57 years old and has worked at the
refinery for 14 years, says he hasn't flaunted his new
wealth. The cash award is still only on paper anyway, he
says. "I'm a carpenter and go to work every day and come home
filthy. I'm just a working man."
   His litigation spawned a bitter feud with his brother,
Jerry, who lives next door and has worked at the refinery for
24 years. The brothers and members of their own families
rarely speak to one another.
   Jerry Fuller says he has been embarrassed by his brother's
suit. "You don't know what I've gone through because of my
brother," he says. "If Ashland loses, several thousand people
will be out of a job. That's all I'm worried about, and my
own future."
   He says he doesn't believe the allegations against Ashland
because he has never suffered any burns while mowing his
grass or ailments from eating vegetables from his garden.
   Jerry Fuller says that he and his wife have been harassed
by neighbors who also are battling with Ashland. He says
neighbors have put up "No Trespassing" signs on both sides of
his property.
   On the other side of the fence, Eloise Fuller, Donald's
wife, says of Jerry, "I stay in the house because of
pollution and him."
   Some area communities have passed resolutions endorsing
Ashland as a good corporate citizen. But when Kenova Mayor
Frank Heck recently pushed one through, a town council
meeting nearly erupted into fisticuffs. Floyd Sowards,
father-in-law of a woman awarded $2.8 million, suggested that
Mr. Heck was biased because his son works at Ashland. The
mayor's reply: "Thank God my son works for Ashland Oil
instead of trying to steal from them."
   Mr. Sowards, who says some people have called him a
"redneck radical," says the mayor had police escort him from
the meeting. In protest, a number of others in the audience
got up to leave. "The mayor came running down after me. The
police stood between us to keep us apart," Mr. Sowards says.
   For his part, Mr. Heck says he doesn't see anything wrong
with benefiting from Ashland's largess. The company recently
donated two used vehicles to the town's police department,
erected a new press box at a community facility and provided
$10,000 to clean up the town dump.
   Some area residents simply don't speak to neighbors for
fear of stirring up the pot. Beady Phillips, 70, recently got
a letter suggesting that he'll leave his wife and run off
with someone else if he ever collects on his suit against
Ashland. He says he shuns possible friendships these days.
"If you're friendly with someone, the first thing you know is
that they find out you're on a lawsuit and they work for
Ashland Oil and then things get mean," Mr. Phillips says.
   Adds Wilma Lawson, who says her seven-year-old son has
been taunted and pushed in mud puddles because of her
involvement in a suit against Ashland: "I'm really afraid
there's going to be bloodshed before it's all over."

   Rail Strike Cripples

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Producers of coal and
forest products in the province's rugged interior said
they'll be forced to halt operations soon unless a 13-day-old
strike by unionized rail workers ends.
   The walkout by 1,700 workers at provincially-owned B.C.
Rail Ltd. has crippled freight transport from dozens of pulp
and lumber mills along B.C. Rail's 980-mile main line and
halted shipments from two mines that jointly account for
about 40% of British Columbia's coal exports.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There have been no negotiations since the walkout began
Sept. 4, and no new talks are planned between the company and
representatives of its seven unions. A meeting is set for
this morning, however, between the warring sides and British
Columbia's minister of labor, who is empowered to force
workers back to their jobs.
   "At the present time {the government} is not considering
intervention," a spokeswoman said late Friday.
   Meanwhile, Quintette Coal Ltd. said it will start reducing
output and temporarily lay off most of the 1,450 workers at
its northeast British Columbia mine beginning Thursday unless
the contract dispute is settled. "We simply have no way of
getting our product to market, and that means that we have no
source of revenue," said the company, which sells its coal to
Japanese steel producers.
   Teck Corp., which owns 61% of the neighboring Bullmoose
coal mine, hasn't yet said what its plans are.
   Weldwood of Canada Ltd., a big lumber and pulp producer,
sees an "imminent" round of shutdowns and layoffs at several
of its mills, some of which already cut output because of the
strike, said Thomas Buell, chairman and chief executive. "The
impact is substantial. We're getting to a point where we
don't know if we'll be able to continue operating," he said.
   Like Weldwood, other big forest products concerns that
rely heavily on B.C. Rail's line through central British
Columbia are using trucks, where possible, to haul freight to
Canadian National Railways' line, which interconnects with
B.C. Rail's system. The hardest-hit producers include Canfor
Corp., Slocan Forest Products Ltd., West Fraser Timber Co.
and Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd., among others.
   "It's certainly created a difficult situation," said a
spokesman for Canfor. A survey of 17 affected sawmills showed
production is down anywhere from 10% to 95%, said Greg
Jadrzyck, spokesman for the Council of Forest Industries of
B.C., a trade group.
   B.C. Rail, which is losing about 4.5 million Canadian
dollars (US$3.8 million) a week due to the strike according
Roger Clarke, vice president, finance, has been running
advertisements in Vancouver newspapers outlining its position
on the dispute. The ads said B.C. Rail's annual union payroll
would jump 60% to C$123 million if it satisfied all of its
unions' demands.
   The ads prominently display the 23.5% one-year wage boost
initially sought by union negotiators, along with other
demands. "That was an opening figure" only, said Clyde
Mulhall, chairman of the Council of Trade Unions of B.C.
Rail, which comprises the company's seven unions.
   "The main issue here is contracting out" work to nonunion
personnel, Mr. Mulhall said. "We've told the company and
everybody that. If they're prepared to negotiate contracting
out, then we'd revert back to a more realistic increase" in
wages.
   The unions' previous three-year contract with B.C. Rail
expired June 30.

   PARIS -- French consumer prices rose 0.6% in August from
July and were up 3.5% from a year earlier, according to
preliminary estimates published Friday by the National
Statistics Institute.
   The 0.6% increase represents a sharp acceleration from
July's 0.3% gain. The upswing had been anticipated, however,
as a result of the pressure on oil prices following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.

   BRAINTREE, Mass. -- Massachusetts health officials
recommended against a planned hazardous waste incinerator in
a blow to Clean Harbors Inc.'s plans to build a $42 million
facility.
   In a nonbinding opinion, the Department of Public Health
said that the plan to build the facility in an industrial
area of heavily populated Braintree was unsuitable because of
concerns about respiratory problems for residents. The state
Secretary of Environmental Affairs is expected to rule on the
plant this week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   William Geary, vice president of public affairs for Clean
Harbors, said company studies indicated "there wouldn't be
any adverse health impact." He said the state health
department hasn't set limits establishing an acceptable risk
level. He added the company might be able to alter its plan
to meet health department worries by limiting either the
volume or the types of waste incinerated.
   Clean Harbors is a hazardous waste hauler and cleans up
oil and toxic waste spills. It operates an incinerator for
medical wastes at the Braintree site. The hazardous waste
incinerator would be Clean Harbors' first such venture and
would be the first hazardous waste facility in Massachusetts,
one of the biggest exporters of hazardous wastes.

   LONDON -- Britain's retail price index in August rose 1%
from July and 10.6% from a year earlier, the Central
Statistical Office said, citing seasonal food prices, the
highest since February 1986.
   The year-to-year increase, which exceeded market
expectations for a 10.3% rise, was the highest since the 11%
advance in February 1982, and outstripped the 10.4% gain in
March 1982.

<TEXT>
   The underlying level of inflation, which excludes mortgage
payments and community tax charges, was 7.9% in August,
compared with 7% in July. Certain mortgage costs and rising
fuel costs in Britain also contributed to the August advance
in inflation, the agency said. Fuel costs contributed 0.2
percentage point to the month-to-month rise. The end of
summer retail sales also contributed to the advance, as
retailers returned to higher-priced items.

   Weintraub Entertainment Group Files
   For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection

   LOS ANGELES -- Weintraub Entertainment Group, one of the
last of the high-flying, hard-falling independent
entertainment companies of the 1980s, said it filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.
   The action was taken after two banks couldn't reach
agreement with closely held WEG and bondholders about
disposition of the company's assets. Some bondholders then
threatened to file an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Flamboyant company chairman Jerry Weintraub raised $461
million in 1986, including distribution deals and credit
lines. He was helped by an alliance with Columbia Pictures
Entertainment, a track record of producing such hits as "The
Karate Kid," a gift for salesmanship and a friendship with
then-Vice President George Bush. But Mr. Weintraub was later
criticized for running the company with lavish overhead and
showing poor judgment in picking motion pictures. Debt
burdens created by purchasing a film library compounded his
problems.
   The company released eight films, the highest-profile of
which was "My Stepmother Is an Alien." None were markedly
successful. Since the spring of 1989, WEG has released only
one movie -- its last in the pipeline -- and has been largely
operating on revenue generated by its film library, which it
bought from Cannon Group in 1987 for about $85 million and
has been trying to sell. The last results made public were
losses of $41.9 million in 1988. Meanwhile Mr. Weintraub and
company president Kenneth Kleinberg have been trying to find
new sources of money in Japan and elsewhere. Last year, they
hired former junk-bond king Michael Milken to help with the
rescue project.
   Bondholders said they were concerned that the secured
creditors, Credit Lyonnais Group's Dutch subsidiary and to a
lesser extent Bank of America, would take possession of
assets worth the approximately $85 million owed to them and
there'd be nothing left over for bondholders. The company and
bondholders hope the film library is an asset which will
appreciate if the company can continue to operate. The
library contains more than 1,700 films, many of them British,
28 television series and a number of classic newsreels.
   Through Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., WEG placed about $81 million
in junk bonds, which paid 13% and were sold to institutions,
notably failed Miami, Fla.-based CenTrust Savings Bank, whose
chairman, David Paul, was a Weintraub director. The company
has missed two $5 million interest payments in recent months.
   A standstill agreement with the banks had helped allow WEG
to operate as long as it did, according to individuals close
to the negotiations. Employees have left the company in
droves since its heyday, and overhead has been cut. Mr.
Weintraub's initial contract called for a salary of $1.7
million a year. The banks were prepared to extend the
agreement, but only under terms unacceptable to bondholders,
and what one source described as "shuttle diplomacy" between
the two parties by the company was unsuccessful.
   According to individuals close to the situation, Credit
Lyonnais has the first security interest in the library and
Bank of America stands to take a loss on its loans.
   Sources also indicated that although majority shareholder
Mr. Weintraub would continue to be involved in the company,
he may step down as chairman. Discussions have occurred with
Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Brothers film unit, both on the
part of the company and Mr. Weintraub personally, but
executives wouldn't provide details.

   Skoda to Pick VW or
   Renault-Volvo for the Ride

   MLADA BOLESLAV, Czechoslovakia -- For the Czech car maker
Skoda Automobilovy Concern, it's nice to be wanted.
   Last week's announcement by Renault S.A. that AB Volvo has
joined its bid for Skoda shows just how heated the
competition has become for a piece of the state-owned
automobile company. To press their case, Volvo's chairman,
Pehr Gyllenhammar, and his Renault counterpart, Raymond Levy,
are currently in Prague during an official visit by French
President Francois Mitterrand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since January, no fewer than 24 companies have expressed
at least a passing interest in Skoda, with numerous
foreigners visiting its plant in this small industrial town
in northern Bohemia. Now, after months of courtship and
negotiating, the finalists are Renault-Volvo and Volkswagen
AG. Each hopes a venture with Skoda would provide a big edge
in Eastern Europe.
   For Renault and Volvo, already linked by a
cross-shareholding pact signed last February, the joint bid
offers a way to spread the investment costs. For Skoda, which
has 21,000 employees, the bid now offers the chance of a
partnership with both a European mass producer and a maker of
prestigious luxury cars.
   Volkswagen and Renault-Volvo will complete their
feasibility studies within a month, says Petr Dedek, Skoda's
45-year-old general director. By then Skoda will have been
converted into a joint stock company. "And that is when the
decision-making will begin," he says.
   Both Volkswagen and Renault, respectively Western Europe's
No. 1 and No. 6 auto makers in terms of market share, already
have tested their auto parts in Skoda cars. But the two are
keeping the financial terms of their proposal under wraps.
   Skoda, citing confidentiality agreements, also is avoiding
making any comment on specific proposals.
   Currently, Prague allows a foreign majority interest in a
joint venture with a domestic firm, but so far has been
undecided on the degree of direct ownership it will allow in
a Czechoslovak company. Skoda, shaping up as an early test
case, is to be given a special ruling.
   "It is a special case in terms of national prestige and
employment," says a finance ministry official, adding: "Skoda
is such an important company that it is politically
sensitive, and (the transaction) has to be decided by the
government, perhaps even parliament."
   While the decision may have to come from the government,
the winner probably will be the bidder going the furthest in
accommodating Mr. Dedek's priority of a costly modernization
program to preserve jobs.
   "We knew that the opening of markets didn't give us a
chance to survive independently for long," says Mr. Dedek,
who early on turned to the international accounting firm
Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. for help in tallying up assets and
finding a likely partner in the West.
   Total investment? "I hate to say it, but about $2
billion," says Mr. Dedek. He quickly adds that the return
won't be long in coming, though, asserting that "Eastern
Europe is starved for cars."
   To compete with Western cars, Mr. Dedek says Skoda
desperately needs a new series of more powerful engines. The
paint plant, dating from 1964, needs to be replaced by a
modern facility. Mr. Dedek is asking for new technology and
wants to add production capacity to increase annual output to
as much as 400,000 cars by the year 2000, compared with
183,000 currently. In addition, Skoda is insisting that its
Western partner bring Skoda cars into the partner's global
marketing, distribution and servicing network.
   Volkswagen, which rushed in its bid early, has the
advantage of its cross-border proximity to the Skoda plants
in the northwest corner of Czechoslovakia. Volkswagen already
plans to invest four billion marks ($2.5 billion) in a new
production facility in Zwickau, East Germany.
   Moreover, Skoda officials speak with admiration of
Volkswagen's experience with Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles
de Turismo S.A. of Spain. Volkswagen acquired the troubled
Spanish auto maker in 1986 and turned it around by selling
SEAT's Ibiza models through Volkswagen's own sales system.
   For Renault-Volvo, Skoda is an opportunity to pull even
with its West German competitor in Eastern Europe and to add
a line of low-cost cars to the pair's line-up of models.
   Of two dozen auto makers, including Japanese producers
that looked at Skoda, most dropped out immediately because of
Skoda's preference for linking up with another European mass
producer. Others withdrew after assessing the costs of a
Skoda modernization and the sheer size of Skoda's operation.
   One of those was the European operations of General Motors
Corp., which is looking to expand its production capacity in
Europe by 25% during the next decade. GM's West German unit,
Adam Opel AG, already has taken over a former East German
auto plant in Eisenach, where it is considering a $700
million investment in new capacity. But GM decided against
Skoda after a lengthy look.
   About 45 years after it was spun off from the Skoda
industrial works in Pilsen, Skoda still makes only the basic
Favorit, a five-door hatchback with a small 1300cc engine,
unveiled in 1988. Next month, the auto maker will introduce a
second car called the Forman, essentially a station-wagon
version of the Favorit.
   In 1989, Skoda sold 114,040 cars in Czechoslovakia, 51,350
in Western Europe and 17,624 in other Comecon countries,
including the Soviet Union.
   Sales last year totaled about 10 billion crowns, or about
$588 million.
   Skoda managers were quick to realize their vulnerability
after the collapse of the Iron Curtain, which had shielded
the firm from direct competition with Western producers. "In
November we knew that it was all over," Mr. Dedek says.
   Currently, Skoda charges Czechsolovaks 85,000 crowns
(about $5,000 at current commercial exchange rates) -- or two
years' wages for the average industrial worker -- for a
basic, no-frills Favorit. The car costs about 50,000 crowns
($2,941) to produce, and the state takes almost all the
35,000-crown profit, leaving Skoda with only 700 crowns a car
for reinvestment. In the West, Skoda charges about $7,740 for
a Favorit, about 55% more than its domestic price.
   Management estimates that if its 250 major suppliers start
charging in hard currency or at Western price levels, Skoda
may have to charge 200,000 crowns for a Favorit to turn a
profit. Increased energy costs, alone, could add another
5,000 crowns to the cost of producing a car, executives say.

   Prime Motor Inns Inc., unable to shake off its cash
problems, said it may file for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The financially strapped operator of hotels said that it
was having difficulty obtaining an additional loan from its
bank lenders, and that unless the loan and other relief is
granted, Prime will "seriously consider filing a petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11."

<TEXT>
   The threat of a Prime bankruptcy-law filing for protection
from creditors' lawsuits caught some securities analysts off
guard. "The company doesn't even talk to investors anymore,"
Caroline Levy, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,
said. "It looks very bad."
   Prime, based in Fairfield, N.J., said that although it
asked for and received from the bank lenders an extension on
the maturity date of loans to July 1991 from March 1991 and
the authority to retain part of proceeds from asset sales,
the banks were "reluctant" to extend any additional loans.
   Prime had requested an additional $25 million line of
credit, but Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. said it would consider
providing the loan only if this could be secured by certain
assets. The company, which had $328 million in bank debt
outstanding last year, has been able reduce bank debt to $110
million under a debt restructuring program that calls for the
selective sale of assets.
   Prime said that it will suspend payment of dividends on
its common shares and that it doesn't expect to make interest
payments on its convertible debentures.
   Two related limited partnerships said that if Prime were
to seek bankruptcy court protection, they also would be hurt.
   Prime Motor Inns Limited Partnership, which indirectly
owns 16 Holiday Inn motels leased to a Prime Motor Inns unit,
said a filing could result in smaller distributions to its
unit holders. And Ramada Assured Income Associates, which is
managed by two Prime Motor Inns units, said a filing could
result in smaller payout to unit holders.
   Prime's latest problems follow a tumultuous decline of
what was once one of the nation's largest hotel companies.
The company's motor inn business took a huge leap in 1986,
when Prime acquired the Howard Johnson motel chain, followed
by a further major acquisitions in the late 1980s.
   Last Friday, Prime shares closed at $1.375, down 37.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Volume
exceeded 1.6 million shares, making it was the fifth most
active issue on the Big Board. The stock, which traded as
high as $38 last year, has swooned in recent days; the shares
traded as high as $5 on Aug. 22 but fell to slightly more
than $2 early last week.
   Short-sellers also have put pressure on the stock. As of
Aug. 15, bearish investors had sold short about 6.2 million
Prime shares. The company has about 33 million shares
outstanding. A short-seller sells shares in anticipation of a
decline in price, and hopes to secure a profit by
repurchasing the shares at a lower price.
   Prime has been battered by a decline in its asset value
and by lower earnings, which fell to $209,000, or one cent a
share, in its third quarter ended March 31, from $18.2
million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The company last month said it would take a $150 million
pretax write-off on certain assets, which would result in a
loss for the fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended
June 30.
   Prime continued to shrink when it sold in July its Ramada
and Howard Johnson franchise system to Blackstone Capital
Partners, New York, for $170 million and its Rodeway
franchise system to Manor Care Inc., Silver Spring, Md., for
$14.9 million. That left Prime with about 136 hotels with
14,000 rooms, down from its heyday of more than 1,100
properties with 150,000 rooms.
   The company said it needed the proceeds to reduce bank
debt, which had increased to about $350 million as result of
Prime's expansion strategy.
   The expansion, however, came in a period of tight
financing and softness in the hotel and real estate markets.
Also, its financial woes were exacerbated by the inability of
FCD Hospitality Inc. to pay back its debt to Prime. Last
year, FCD borrowed $200 million from Prime to purchase
Servico, a hotel operator, from Southmark Corp.
   Following Friday's announcement, Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it lowered its ratings on Prime's convertible
subordinated debentures to Caa from Ba-3. Another credit
rating concern, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., said it downgraded
its rating on Prime's subordinated debt to single-C from
single-B-minus. A rating of C indicates that a default on the
debt is imminent, S&amp;P said.

   PRIME MOTOR INNS Inc. said bank lenders were considering
extending the maturity date of existing loans and allowing
the company to retain a part of proceeds from asset sales.
Yesterday's edition incorrectly said lenders had agreed to
the extension and to the sharing of proceeds.

   Moscow Protesters Demand Resignation
   Of Ryzhkov, Direct Presidential Election

   MOSCOW -- Tens of thousands gathered in central Moscow
yesterday evening demanding the resignation of Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov and his government and calling for direct
presidential elections.
   The demonstration was a show of strength for the fractured
political left, which called for a coalition of democratic
forces to replace the current government and to implement
radical economic changes that would lead to a market-based
economy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A string of politicians addressed the crowd from a high
balcony of the Moskva Hotel near Red Square. "We are in a
catastrophic situation in this country," said Sergei
Kavalyov, a member of the Russian parliament. "Our leadership
is not a leadership we elected, it's a leadership we
inherited."
   The crowd broke into frequent applause and shouts of
"Resignation] Down with Ryzhkov]" and held up placards with
slogans such as, "Communists] You wrecked the country and
robbed the people."
   (Separately, AP-Dow Jones News Service reported that Italy
agreed to give the beleaguered Soviet Union three trillion
lire ($2.56 billion) in extraordinary credits after Mr.
Gorbachev acknowledged his nation is in danger of bankruptcy.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis announced the
loans Saturday following his Kremlin meetings with Mr.
Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. On
Friday, Mr. Gorbachev described the Soviet international
economic position as "catastrophic." He also warned of
possible government insolvency on international markets. The
Soviet Union has been late paying its international bills,
and must cut its imports of medicine and consumer goods for
lack of hard currency.)
   Last night's demonstration wasn't huge by this year's
Moscow standards, but it occurred against a background of
political turmoil as the leadership struggles to select a
program for economic reform. At the core of the battle are
two programs -- one, a moderate reform proposal by the
Ryzhkov-led government, and the other a more radical program
drafted by a team led by Stanislav Shatalin and backed by
both Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and popular Russian
leader Boris Yeltsin.
   These two programs, and a compromise alternative that
makes some minor adjustments to the Shatalin plan, have been
sent to the parliaments of each republic and to the national
parliament. Last week, the Russian parliament passed the
Shatalin program, stepping up the pressure on Mr. Ryzhkov.
Mr. Yeltsin repeatedly has called for the prime minister to
resign.
   Mr. Gorbachev has so far hesitated to push his hand-picked
prime minister to resign, but he has said it might not be
effective to have Mr. Ryzhkov in charge of implementing a
program that he doesn't support. Last week, Mr. Ryzhkov
himself said that he cannot implement a program he doesn't
agree with.
   Details of the programs have trickled out over the past
weeks, but haven't been widely publicized in the Soviet
Union. Both programs say that a market economy is the only
way to help the Soviet Union out of its economic crisis. But
the programs differ in some fundamental ways.
   The Shatalin plan answers the growing passion for regional
sovereignty in the Soviet Union, stating that the central
government would exercise only those powers allowed it by the
15 republics. It would take 500 days to implement and would
start with fiscal austerity, widespread privatization and
decentralization of government. Free prices would be
introduced later. Mr. Ryzhkov argues that such a plan could
mean the end of statehood for a unified Soviet Union and will
lead to a steep drop in living standards. He advocates less
decentralization, more moderate de-monopolization, and
immediate price increases to be set by the government.
   Many people at last night's demonstration weren't exactly
clear on the contents of either plan, but they were sure that
they no longer trusted Mr. Ryzhkov's government to take any
action that would help them. Some hinted that the sudden
shortages of key items such as bread and cigarettes in Moscow
may have been orchestrated by anti-reformers determined to
stop perestroika. Such a conspiracy theory has been widely
discussed in Moscow in recent days.

   Government Wants to Change S&amp;L Sales
   That Gave $4.2 Billion in Tax Benefits
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- The government wants to alter roughly 200
controversial thrift sales that bestowed about $4.2 billion
in tax benefits on wealthy buyers in 1988, but it's unlikely
the cash-strapped savings and loan cleanup agency can take
action any time soon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, financier Ronald Perelman, who struck the
sweetest deal with $1.8 billion in tax benefits alone, also
secured the most ironclad transaction, with fewest government
options within the contract to reduce costs.
   For more than six hours Friday, former S&amp;L regulators
defended the sales before the House Banking Committee, saying
that the sales, conducted in an atmosphere of urgency in late
1988 before tax benefits were to expire, were the best they
could do in dire circumstances.
   Hundreds of thrifts were insolvent, and the S&amp;L insurance
fund was broke. To attract buyers for the institutions, the
regulators gave them high-interest bearing notes and other
assistance to compensate for the money-losing assets in the
sick thrifts. "When you have an imposed deadline, no cash and
doubtful credit, you are going to pay through the nose," said
William Seidman, the head of the Resolution Trust Corp.,
which runs the S&amp;L cleanup. "I would say the real question is
whether they should have undertaken the transactions at all."
   Now, regulators are combing through the agreements,
looking for ways to reduce costs without breaking the
contracts. Such options include paying off the notes, or
buying the thrift assets and managing them at lower costs.
   Mr. Seidman said that a study of the 1988 thrift deals by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will be released
tomorrow, but that he expects final costs to have risen to
$54 billion on a present value basis from $39 billion,
because of poor assumptions by the thrift regulators, as well
as declining values in real estate held by the thrifts. A
House Banking Committee study pegged the costs at $71
billion.
   Exercising those options requires huge piles of cash, up
front. Hence, Larry White, a former thrift regulator who
helped structure the deals, projected that the government
could save $6.4 billion over eight years by prepaying the
notes alone. But the RTC doesn't currently have the $25
billion required to buy back the notes in the first place.
The S&amp;L cleanup funding is part of the federal budget talks
between Congress and the Bush administration.
   Even if the cleanup agency had the liquidity, in the case
of Mr. Perelman it doesn't have the contractual right.
According to a House Banking Committee study, the Perelman
acquisition of five thrifts, now known as First Gibraltar,
Houston, received $2.3 billion in tax-free notes. The first
$865 million can't be prepaid for five years; as for the
rest, the holder is protected against loss in case of
repayment.
   Even so, a spokesman for MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings
Inc., Mr. Perelman's New York-based company, said he believed
some government costs might be trimmed from the transaction.
"Within the four corners of our deal, there is room for some
cost-savings," he said, but he didn't know by how much. "A
wholesale renegotiation isn't foreseeable," he said.
   Mr. Perelman is still buying up thrifts, even though the
S&amp;L cleanup law, passed last year, explicitly barred any of
the 1988 buyers from acquiring other thrifts with government
assistance. But that rule was scrapped because so few bidders
have sought the S&amp;Ls. Just Friday, First Gibraltar acquired
Sooner Federal Savings &amp; Loan, a $1.2 billion-asset Tulsa,
Okla., thrift. And previously it acquired $2.6 billion San
Antonio Savings Association. Both are operated separately
from First Gibraltar.
   Mr. Seidman said regulators are also trying to determine
if there is a legal basis for voiding thrift sales. So far,
they haven't found one, he said.
   Details of the transactions infuriated the committee.
Members complained that the Robert Bass Group was given the
exclusive right to bid for American Savings Bank, Stockton,
Calif., for more than six months, a decision Mr. White said
he regretted. The panel was also outraged that the wealthy
Caroline Hunt Trust Estate, Dallas, was released from an
agreement to keep its Southwest Savings Association, Dallas,
well-capitalized.
   "Frankly, these make the average citizen question very
seriously the intents and capabilities of the U.S.
government, if not its integrity," said Rep. Jim Leach (R.,
Iowa.)

   Souter's Position on Key Issues Remains
   An Enigma as Senate Hearings Progress

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Although Senate confirmation hearings for
David Souter may last two or three more days, there appears
to be little doubt that the New Hampshire judge is poised to
take a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.
   But his deft testimony has caused senators, liberal and
conservative interest groups, and lawyers to wonder where he
will sit on the high court's spectrum of legal views.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Based on his 10 hours of interrogation thus far, he
appears likely to fit in the court's ideological middle -- a
moderately conservative spot occupied most often by Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.
   On at least two issues -- when the government must
accommodate religious practices and how to decide what rights
the guarantee of "due process" protects -- Judge Souter
rejected the views of the court's most ardent conservative,
Justice Antonin Scalia, and said he prefers the approach of
Justice O'Connor.
   This may upset some conservatives, who hope Judge Souter
will be a staunch ally for Justice Scalia and Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist. During questioning Friday, conservative
Republican Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Gordon Humphrey
of New Hampshire seemed flustered when some of Judge Souter's
answers fell short of dogmatic conservative responses.
   Conservatives have been disappointed in the failure of a
solid majority to coalesce on issues such as abortion,
religious freedom and affirmative action. The court has moved
in a more conservative direction on these issues, usually by
5-4 margins, but the five-vote majority frequently has been
splintered, with Justice O'Connor and, sometimes, Justices
Anthony M. Kennedy and Byron R. White reaching the same
results but following different legal reasoning.
   The more solid four-vote liberal wing of Justices Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, long led
by Justice William J. Brennan Jr., was sometimes able to take
advantage of conservative differences to secure a fifth vote
for a majority. Justice Brennan's retirement on July 20,
creating the vacancy for which Judge Souter was nominated,
will make it much tougher for the liberal wing to obtain a
majority.
   But the question remains whether the conservative majority
will become any more cohesive once Judge Souter, a former New
Hampshire Supreme Court justice who turned 51 years old
today, joins their ranks.
   It is difficult to predict the performance of Supreme
Court justices, since most justices say it takes them five
years to really learn the job and since some of their views
have changed once they were on the bench. Based on his own
testimony, however, Judge Souter shed some light on his
approach to a few important legal issues.
   Last April, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, the high
court ruled that Oregon may prohibit the use of the
hallucinogenic drug, peyote, by the Native American Church.
State laws that are applicable to everyone don't violate the
First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom, even when
they prohibit a religious ritual, Justice Scalia wrote,
saying the state needn't justify such interference.
   In a separate opinion, Justice O'Connor said Justice
Scalia's decision "dramatically departs" from
long-established First Amendment decisions that require the
state to have a strong justification for interfering with
religious practices.
   Judge Souter, although emphasizing that he wasn't making a
commitment, said he preferred Justice O'Connor's approach.
   In another instance, Justice Scalia wrote in a 1989
decision that the 14th Amendment guarantee of "due process"
protects those individual liberties that are rooted in
American history when examined only in the narrowest terms.
In a separate opinion, Justice O'Connor rejected such a
narrow role for history and tradition in defining civil
liberties. In his testimony on Friday, Judge Souter, too,
rejected such a narrow approach.
   In other developments in the hearings, which continue
today:
   -- Judge Souter said he would have an open mind with no
"agenda" on the question of whether to overrule Roe vs. Wade,
the 1973 decision that recognized the right to abortion.
   -- Abortion-rights groups announced their opposition to
him, since they want a nominee committed to upholding the
right.
   -- Judge Souter said affirmative action is necessary,
although he was careful not to commit himself in the
continuing debate over how far it may properly go. When
discrimination has been proven, he said, it isn't enough to
stop it. "The appropriate response is to say, `Undo it.'"

   As Market for New Issues Sinks, Investors
   Are Flocking to IPOs of Oil-Service Firms

   NEW YORK -- As the market for new issues sinks, investors
are crowding into one of the few lifeboats left: new
offerings of oil-service companies.
   Fans of the stocks argue that even if oil prices ease next
year, these companies that provide geological research,
equipment and other services for oil drilling will still
outperform both the market and the major oil companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There is reason for investors to be finicky. Increased
exploration for oil around the world is tempting some
marginal, as well as strong, companies to raise money on Wall
Street.
   "You want to take a long, hard look at the companies
coming public now," says Miles J. Cohen, a portfolio manager
for Norwest Bank Minnesota, in Minneapolis. Smaller companies
could suffer in an industry increasingly dominated by such
giants as Baker Hughes Inc., Dresser Industries Inc.,
Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. "Unless they have a
particular niche, they'll have a tough time," says Mr. Cohen.
   But investors who haven't yet climbed on the energy
bandwagon may find some bargains among better-quality new
issues. "The trends are still going in your favor," advises
Anthony Socci, energy sector analyst for Dreyfus Corp., New
York.
   Barring sudden peace in the Mideast, oil prices are
expected to stay high enough to stimulate increased
exploration and production. By November, prices could climb
to $35 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, says
William H. Brown III, oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
However, as new supplies flow, prices could fall to the low
20s within a year, Mr. Brown predicts. That drop should hurt
the stocks of major oil companies more than oil-service
stocks, he adds.
   At worst, oil-service stocks could drop 10% to 15% over
the next two years if oil prices collapse, estimates James
Carroll, oil-service analyst for PaineWebber Inc. More
likely, he thinks oil stocks will rise 50% to 100% during
that period as companies scramble to keep up with new
exploration and production. That ascent "will be filled with
plenty of potholes" as stocks react to fluctuating oil
prices, he warns.
   New issues, some of them already priced at 10% to 15%
discounts to existing oil-service stocks, could become
cheaper as investment bankers try to please investors
frightened by the crumbling new issues market, Mr. Carroll
adds. "From the standpoint of the buyer, it's a wonderful
time to look at new deals," he says.
   Among the oil-service IPOs scheduled for a debut this fall
are:
                                                                                                       

   Grant-Norpac: At an expected $10 to $12 apiece,
Grant-Norpac's four million shares will be reasonably priced
based on the seismic company's estimated 1991 earnings of 80
cents to $1 a share, says Mr. Socci. None of the Houston
company's insiders are selling, which tells Mr. Socci "they
don't think this is the top" for the shares. Grant-Norpac
collects, processes and markets seismic data for land-based
oil exploration, and ranks number five among such companies.
More than 60% of revenue comes from overseas -- none in Iraq
or Kuwait. Risks include currency fluctuations and political
uncertainty. Underwriters are Salomon Brothers Inc. and
Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs.
                                                                                                       

   Moorco: At an indicated range of $10 to $12 a share,
Moorco's initial offering looks attractive to Robert Natale,
emerging-growth stock analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. The
Houston company makes fluid measurement and pressure control
products for the energy industry. Moorco estimates 1991
earnings at $1 a share, according to Mr. Natale, putting its
price-to-earnings multiple below that of a similar public
company, Daniel Industries. Moorco will offer four million
common shares as insiders sell two million; proceeds will be
used to redeem preferred shares and reduce debt. Underwriters
are PaineWebber Inc. and Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   Input/Output: Currently a subsidiary of Triton Energy
Corp., the Stafford, Texas, maker of seismic data acquisition
systems depends heavily on sales of its $2 million system. In
1990, 84% of revenue came from selling this system. Triton
will own 28% after an offering of 3.2 million shares by
Triton and 1.7 million shares by the company, at an indicated
range of $9 to $11 apiece. Mr. Natale is leery of the
reliance on one big-ticket item, saying there are too many
uncertainties for him. "You really have to be careful,"
agrees one West Coast money manager. "There's no way to know
if a company will lose or gain a contract." Underwriters are
PaineWebber and Salomon.
                                                                                                       

   Vetco Gray: The Houston maker of oil exploration and
production equipment is planning an initial offering of nine
million shares at an indicated $17 to $19 apiece to buy back
a controlling interest held by Bain Venture Capital. The
heavy insider selling by the venture capitalists "throws up a
caution flag" for Mr. Natale. "If this is such a good
investment, why are these people pulling $118 million out?"
he asks. Nonetheless, he says he advised investors to buy the
offering if shares can be had for $15. Combustion Engineering
will increase its 20% stake as a result of the offering.
Underwriters are Salomon and Shearson Lehman Brothers.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Over-the-counter stocks again fell prey to increased
tensions in the Mideast and worries about the economy.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.76 to 374.42, a 0.5%
loss, as volume eased to 103.5 million shares from 105.7
million shares Thursday. Declining shares overpowered
advancing stocks, 1,072 to 739; 196 stocks fell to new lows
and only 15 climbed to new highs.
   Adobe Systems, the day's third most active stock, fell 1
1/4 to 26 7/8 on 1.4 million shares, although the software
systems company reported that earnings for the third quarter
ended Aug. 31 rose to 45 cents a share from 41 cents a share
a year earlier.
   Without a one-time, $3 million royalty payment by a
vendor, Adobe's third-quarter earnings would have been about
38 cents to 41 cents a share, according to Shearson Lehman
Brothers analyst David S. Nelson. Mr. Nelson, who maintains a
"buy" opinion on Adobe, told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report he cut his estimates for the Mountain View, Calif.,
company's fourth-quarter and full-year earnings.
   Western Publishing Group fell 5/8 to 13 7/8 after the New
York publisher reported that earnings for the second quarter
ended Aug. 4 fell to four cents a share from six cents a
share a year earlier. The latest quarter included a one-time
charge of three cents a share for acquisition costs.
   Kentucky Medical Insurance eased 1/4 to 10 after falling
from a Sept. 7 close of 17 1/2. The Louisville provider of
medical liability insurance said it appeared that a large
stockholder was forced to sell shares to meet margin
requirements. Kentucky Medical said the stockholder isn't
related to the company or its principals.

   Eurocom Negotiating Revamping
   Of HDM International Network

   PARIS -- Eurocom S.A., the large French ad agency, is
negotiating a restructuring and possible breakup of the HDM
international ad agency network that it owns with Young &amp;
Rubicam Inc. of the U.S. and Japan's Dentsu Inc.
   "For some time we have been holding discussions on the
relative ownership of HDM," says John Cooper, Young &amp;
Rubicam's general counsel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far, however, the restructuring talks haven't produced
results.
   "Our joint venture agreement says that any changes require
unanimous agreement," explains Mr. Cooper. "We have discussed
all sorts of possibilities."
   Insiders familiar with the talks say they could lead to
each partner buying the others out in its own region. Eurocom
holds a majority of HDM in Europe, Young &amp; Rubicam holds a
majority in the U.S. and Dentsu holds a majority in Asia.
   HDM appears to be facing two kinds of problems. For
starters, Eurocom, which is the 43%-owned advertising
affiliate of French media giant Havas S.A., has changed its
international strategy since forming HDM in 1987. Instead of
pursuing alliances, it now wants to be an international
advertising power on its own.
   Last year, Eurocom created its own international network
by acquiring 60% control of London-based WCRS Group PLC's
advertising operations, whose assets include Della Femina
McNamee WCRS of the U.S. To compete with ad elephants such as
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. and WPP Group PLC, Eurocom feels it
must grow still bigger and more international.
   It wants to make HDM a more energetic world-wide agency,
by growing in the U.S. with or without Young &amp; Rubicam. "We
want Young &amp; Rubicam to make a push to buy new agencies or
otherwise make HDM bigger in the U.S.," says a Eurocom
official. "If this doesn't happen we must take another look
at things."
   So far, HDM's U.S. performance has been weak, and that is
its second big problem. According to Advertising Age, HDM's
1989 gross margin (a measure of revenue) was $231.4 million
in Europe, $106.1 million in Asia and Australia, and $30.2
million in the U.S.
   A Eurocom spokesman says it and Young &amp; Rubicam have
agreed on a deadline for improving HDM's U.S. results. If the
deadline isn't met, the spokesman says, they will "envisage a
change." The Eurocom official wouldn't specify the deadline.
   Young &amp; Rubicam says it is trying. "We have agreed with
them for some time that Young &amp; Rubicam will lend its efforts
to improving things in the U.S.," says Mr. Cooper. "That
means creating a larger agency." But he says, "The U.S.
market isn't easy." While Young &amp; Rubicam has looked for more
than a year for a U.S. acquisition for HDM, he says, "Nothing
is imminent."
   People involved in the talks say hopes of saving the joint
venture look bleak. One of them compares the talks to divorce
negotiations, and says a central sticking point is simply
money.
   Eurocom feels that, since it created most of HDM's
revenue, it shouldn't have to pay Young &amp; Rubicam or Dentsu
much to buy them out. Young &amp; Rubicam has told Eurocom that
it has made a big effort in the U.S., which is a tougher,
slower-growing market than Europe. Since any agreement must
be unanimous, the divorce talks are dragging on.
   Eurocom says it already is looking for U.S. acquisitions
itself, which it presumably could use to expand either HDM or
its own WCRS-based network, which it has renamed EWDB.
Advertising sources say that earlier this year, Eurocom
approached Saatchi &amp; Saatchi about buying its Backer
Spielvogel Bates subsidiary, based on the old Ted Bates
network.
   "BSB isn't for sale," says a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi spokesman.
"We are financially secure. We don't have to sell anything we
don't want to sell, and we don't want to sell BSB."
   HDM's roots are in a 20-year-old Asian cooperation
arrangement between Dentsu and Young &amp; Rubicam. Eurocom and
Young &amp; Rubicam then formed their own joint venture in 1985,
and in 1987 Dentsu was officially added, to create the
current structure.

   Hirst Leaves Saatchi
                                                                                                       

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. said W. Jonathan T. Hirst resigned
as president and chief executive officer of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Holdings (USA), the holding company for Saatchi's U.S.
interests.
   The company said only that Mr. Hirst, 41 years old, left
the company "to pursue other career interests." A spokesman
denied industry speculation that Mr. Hirst, a longtime
Saatchi executive who was appointed president just a year and
a half ago, was forced out in a cost-cutting move.
   He will be succeeded by Martin Tucker, 67, who was
formerly general counsel for the U.S. holding company. No one
has been named to succeed Mr. Tucker as general counsel.
   Mr. Hirst, who has worked on efforts to sell Saatchi's
consulting businesses, will continue to act as a consultant
to complete the previously announced sale of Gartner Group,
one of the firm's former consulting units.

   Tokyo stocks finished lower Friday as heavy futures and
options related selling because of the close of the September
futures contract met some resistance from investment trust
fund buying by the Big Four securities houses.
   Traders said a weak day in the Japanese government bond
market aggravated fears of interest rate increases, damping
sentiment.

<TEXT>
   London shares finished close to the day's lowest level as
the market was hurt by a poor session on Wall Street and a
discounted futures market.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues was down 177.62 points,
or 0.71%, at 24897.46. Volume on the first section was
estimated at 530 million shares, down from 565.9 million
Thursday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 691 to 294, while
144 issues were unchanged.
   In early trading Monday, the Nikkei index fell another
207.15 points to close the morning session at 24690.31.
   In Friday's trading, the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed in the first section fell 17 points, or 0.89%,
to 1895.68.
   The second section index fell 11.18 points, or 0.31%, to
3586.82. Volume in the section was estimated at seven million
shares, down from 7.5 million shares Thursday.
   Traders said there was a huge amount of sell orders at the
start of trading Friday as the market moved to settle
arbitrage positions.
   "There were 14.5 million sell orders at the opening. I
thought the market would fall 500 points," said one trader.
   However, the trader said new investment trust funds set up
by the Big Four securities firms "bought cash like crazy to
support the market."
   Although the volume of trading was relatively heavy
compared with recent levels, traders said dealings were
mostly lethargic following the early flurry of activity, with
institutional investors on the sidelines.
   Traders said the seven-basis point rise on the benchmark
Japanese government bond to 8.415% at the close of stock
trading depressed sentiment, aggravating fears of further
interest rate increases. A basis point is 1/100th of a
percentage point.
   Traders said most sectors suffered overall declines
Friday.
   But despite the drop, many traders said they see the
market poised to move higher in the near future.
   Amy Yip, sales manager with Baring Securities Ltd., said
the market could push higher to around 28000 points.
   "The market has been worrying about oil prices, the yen
and interest rates," Ms. Yip said. "The yen has turned
positive and the impact of higher oil on the Japanese economy
looks less negative than originally feared so you can say
that 1 1/2 of the factors have turned positive," Ms. Yip
said.
   Stephen Good, a sales representative with McIntosh
Securities, said the recent uptick in trading volume suggests
that a number of individual investors are returning to the
market.
   Mr. Good said the potential for one more discount rate
increase could weigh on the market for the near term but once
that is out of the way, the market should be set to recover
on the strength of Japanese economic fundamentals.
   Traders said expected buying at around 24000 points plus
the potential addition of more than 200 billion yen ($1.47
billion) in new investment trust funds could begin to send
the market higher.
   Traders said they expect growing interest in Japanese
investments will start with the bond market and spill over
into the stock market.
   However, some participants remain bearish about the
market's outlook.
   "There weren't a lot of institutional investors out there
buying" Friday, said one trader. "There were just four or
five big players supporting the market and they had to eat an
awful lot of stocks to keep it at this level. And there were
a lot of people eager to sell," the trader added.
   In London, traders said that with the escalation of
hostilities in the Middle East and Friday's disclosure of an
unexpectedly high 10.6% U.K. August inflation rate, caution
would prevail in the market for the near future.
   "It was an unhappy end to a lackluster week," one trader
said. Wall Street's decline during the course of London
trading generated selling pressure in the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 futures market, prompting falls in
the main market, traders said.
   Market makers retained control of price movements in a
"trendless market," one trader said, as only selective buying
occured.
   The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed down 33.3 points at
2093.8, falling steadily after a midmorning recovery pushed
the market to an intraday high of 2122.1.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 30.3 points to
1609.6; volume was 418 million shares, up from Thursday's
335.4 million shares.
   In the futures markets, the September FT-SE 100 index
contract traded at 2085, down from Thursday's close of 2137.
   Among the main movers in the market, chemicals
conglomerate ICI slipped 36 pence to 829 pence (68 cents to
$15.60) following a statement in Toronto on Thursday by the
chairman that was taken by some analysts to indicate a
slowdown in the company's earnings in the year ahead. The
company, however, said his remarks pertained to a general,
global economic slowdown.
   Thorn EMI gained 4 pence to 616 pence, helped by a buy
recommendation from securities house Kleinwort Benson.
   Brewing concern Bass fell 32 pence to 958 pence as
Barclays de Zoete Wedd cut the company's profit forecast.
Other brewing stocks fared poorly. Allied-Lyons fell 10 pence
to 465 pence and Grand Metropolitan dropped 7 pence to 564
pence.
   Rank Organisation fell 32 pence to 558 pence. One trader
said the fall followed news of a downgrading by a London
brokerage firm, while another trader said he detected selling
pressure from New York.
   Water stocks held firm. Thames Water added a penny to 227
pence. North West Water gained 3 pence to 223 pence.
   Enterprise Oil, down 15 pence to 650 pence, was hit by
continuing rumors that Elf Aquitaine might sell its stake in
the company. Other oil stocks, were mixed.
   Meanwhile, shares closed lower on all major European and
Asian markets. South African gold stocks closed narrowly
mixed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   Airlines Seek
   To Increase
   Their Fares

   CHICAGO -- Faced with record losses, the airline industry
is attempting to push through a second round of fare
increases since the Middle East conflict raised the cost of
jet fuel.
   If the latest fare increases stick, the public's cost of
flying will have jumped roughly 10% since Iraq invaded
oil-rich Kuwait Aug. 2.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Friday, a number of U.S. carriers began signaling that
they want to raise domestic fares starting Oct. 1. AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines unit, Continental Airlines, USAir
Group Inc. and America West Airlines said Friday they plan to
raise fares 4.2%.
   NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines has indicated it is
interested in going along with a second round of fare hikes.
While United Airlines hasn't disclosed what strategy it plans
to take, executives at the UAL Corp. unit don't believe fares
have increased enough to cover ballooning jet fuel costs, a
source said.
   As a result of the first fare increase, which amounted to
5.3% on Aug. 30, the cheapest round-trip fare between New
York and Chicago rose to $284 from $270. That fare will
increase to $296 if the airlines' new plan takes effect in
two weeks.
   The airline industry has scrambled to figure out ways to
handle the surge in jet fuel prices. So far, some carriers
have put a freeze on hiring, laid off thousands and reduced
flight schedules. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts are
slashing earnings projections.
   Although this second round of fare increases didn't gain
momentum until Friday, it started quietly two weeks ago. Pan
American World Airways laid plans to raise its fares 4.4%
starting Sept. 18. That prompted Alaska Air Group Inc. to
plan a 4.7% increase as of Oct. 1.
   Thursday, Delta Air Lines executives decided on a 4.2%
increase. Eastern Airlines matched the move while Pan Am
postponed its increase until Oct. 1. Eastern and Continental
are units of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., formerly
Texas Air Corp.
   The carriers would probably drop their plans if a major
player doesn't participate. Airlines rarely raise fares
unless all of their rivals indicate that they are doing the
same. In this case, airline executives seem to agree that
higher ticket prices are needed to offset their higher fuel
expenses.
   Most are reporting that the price of aviation fuel, the
industry's second-largest expense, has risen 30 cents a
gallon since the invasion to about 90 cents from 60 cents.
Industry experts predict airlines will post record losses for
the year ending in December. Economists and Wall Street
analysts are calculating that the industry will generate a
net loss of at least $1 billion.
   The sudden squeeze on major airlines is also beginning to
chill smaller carriers. Late last week, WestAir Holding Inc.,
a United commuter, said it is furloughing 74 pilots and axing
money-losing routes in the Northwest and California.
   In addition to raising domestic fares, U.S. carriers are
also lobbying the government to permit them to raise overseas
fares by 6% to 10%. Unlike domestic fares, international
ticket prices are regulated by bilateral agreements.
   Last Friday, analysts at the U.S. Transportation
Department's international rates and fares division gave
their secret recommendation to high-ranking department
officials. Jeffrey Shane, assistant secretary for policy and
international affairs, will study the staff recommendation
and make a final decision.
   The industry's effort to raise international passenger and
cargo fares was hammered out about two weeks ago in meetings
between U.S. and foreign members of the International Air
Transport Association, an industry group.
   The Transportation Department is also weighing a
little-known proposal by airlines to pass on to consumers the
cost of higher insurance rates prompted by the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait. This applies mostly to airlines that fly to the
Middle East. The trade group IATA wants to tag a so-called
war-risk surcharge onto fares. Carriers also want the power
to decide the length and amount of the surcharge.
   Although details of the staff opinion aren't available,
department insiders say that Transportation Department
Secretary Samuel Skinner is sympathetic to the reasoning of
the airlines. A decision is expected as early as this week.
   A few governments have already indicated their support for
the international fare increases. For example, Israel is
allowing its national carrier, El Al, to raise its overseas
fares by 10%.
   Amid rising fares and over-capacity, some airlines are
turning to short-term promotions to court customers who don't
have to travel for business. Northwest, for instance, is
sending its frequent flier members "Endless Summer" coupons
that let them travel round trip in the continental U.S. for
$169 if they book seven days in advance and comply with
certain rules such as staying over a Saturday night. These
fares must be bought by Oct. 1, the same day the higher fares
kick in.

   PARIS -- France's Finance Ministry, searching for a way to
hold down inflation figures, decided not to raise tobacco
prices, which were scheduled to increase 3%.
   The increase was part of a broad anti-smoking campaign
under which prices were set to go up another 15% sometime
next year.

   The tobacco monopoly still will get a wholesale-price
boost, but not till Jan. 1. But that day the government also
will cut the value-added tax on cigarettes, neatly offsetting
the wholesale boost. So consumer prices won't change.

   Aon's Corroon Bid Reflects Daring,
   Cool Calculation of Ryan, Its Chief

   CHICAGO -- Aon Corp.'s $840 million bid for Corroon &amp;
Black Corp. last week surprised a lot of people. It shouldn't
have, say those who know Aon's chairman, Patrick G. Ryan.
   "The history of Pat Ryan has been a series of
acquisitions," says Donald P. Jacobs, dean of Northwestern
University's Kellogg School of Management and an admirer of
the insurance executive who started his own car-insurance
agency with only a secretary and now runs a multinational
company with $9 billion in assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, Mr. Ryan isn't reluctant to chase bigger fish.
Corroon &amp; Black, an insurance broker with twice the business
of Aon's brokerage unit, was weighing a bid from Willis Faber
PLC of London, when Aon countered with its all-cash offer.
   If successful -- Corroon hasn't yet indicated its druthers
-- Mr. Ryan would achieve a business combination he admits to
having long "fantasized" about. Together, Aon's Rollins
Burdick Hunter Group unit and Corroon would become the
world's fourth-largest insurance brokerage, with annual
revenue approaching $1 billion.
   Although he calls such a marriage "a perfect fit," Mr.
Ryan conceded in an interview that "frankly, I didn't think
there'd be a possibility. But when we realized that Corroon
said they were willing to look at alternative offers, we
decided to look more carefully. Their size catapults us to
the level of involvement in this business that puts us many
years ahead of schedule."
   In the past, Aon and Corroon have been rivals not only in
competing for clients but also in seeking other companies to
buy. "When we bought Rollins Burdick we knew Corroon was
anxious to acquire it," Mr. Ryan said. "We missed out on the
opportunity to acquire three or four other excellent
brokerage firms we had identified as good fits and which
instead went with Corroon."
   Some analysts initially frowned at Aon's all-cash offer,
contending that many Corroon shareholders would prefer Willis
Faber's stock proposal because of capital-gains tax
considerations. But a source close to Aon says many of
Corroon's holders are tax-exempt funds, and notes that
Corroon's stock had fallen in price before Aon's bid, thus
reducing potential tax liabilities for others.
   Corroon closed last Friday at $36.125, off 12.5 cents for
the day but up $5.25 for the week. Aon closed at $32.625, up
75 cents for the day and down $2.50 for the week. Both stocks
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Mr. Ryan insists he's not interested in a fight over
Corroon -- "we're not hostile people" -- but colleagues,
noting Mr. Ryan's background is risk analysis, say they
wouldn't bet against him. "If there's going to be a fight, he
has a very high probability of winning," says Peter Crist,
managing partner of a Chicago executive search firm, Russell
Reynolds Associates.
   Aon's chief executive officer also is poker-faced. Even as
Aon was going after Corroon, its 53-year-old silver-haired
CEO hosted a two-hour luncheon of Chicago's blue-chip
Economic Club without disclosing his inner excitement. "I was
sitting there wondering how many phone calls were waiting for
me back at the office," Mr. Ryan now admits, but one of those
attending the luncheon says "he didn't even blink."
   Cool calculation is a Ryan trademark, one that has made
him among this city's wealthiest executives, sought after as
a director by both corporations and charities -- his boards
include First Chicago Corp., Commonwealth Edison Co. and the
Field Museum of Natural History, and viewed on Wall Street as
an innovator in what's often regarded as a staid industry.
   Mr. Ryan's business holdings also include a 20% interest
in the Chicago Bears football team, which he recently
acquired with another businessman.
   The son of a Wisconsin Ford dealer, Mr. Ryan got into the
insurance business after graduating from Northwestern, where
he played football and earned a degree in business. He
pioneered the idea of credit insurance for car buyers making
installment payments and parlayed that concept into a
multilined company, Ryan Insurance Group, that in 1982 merged
with what was then called Combined International Corp.
   At the time Combined, the province of W. Clement Stone,
the colorful, cigar-smoking motivational dynamo, was in need
not only of a successor to Mr. Stone but of a growth stimulus
as well. Mr. Ryan agreed to sell out to the much larger
Combined for a 13% equity position and a promise that he
would come in as chief.
   Changing the company's name to Aon, Gaelic for "oneness,"
Mr. Ryan soon set about ending what one analyst calls
Combined's "Stone Age." He slashed costs, thinned management
and continued his strategy of growth through internal
expansion and acquisition. In 1982 Aon added Rollins Burdick
Hunter. Four years later it bought Life Insurance Co. of
Virginia for $557 million.
   When Mr. Ryan's tenure began, Combined's annual net income
was $81.7 million, or $2.80 a share, with $2.4 billion in
assets. Last year Aon reported net income of $232.4 million,
or $3.54 a share, and assets of $9.1 billion.
   Because he is Aon's largest shareholder, Mr. Ryan is "much
more bottom-line and profit-oriented than most insurance
executives," says Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Herbert
Goodfriend.
   Indeed. Mr. Ryan's 8.7 million shares brought him
$11,938,152 in dividend income last year, dwarfing his salary
and bonus package of $789,292, according to Aon's proxy
statement.

   Ford's Canadian Workers Begin Strike;
   Union Threatens to End Contract Talks

   TORONTO -- Almost 13,000 employees at Ford Motor Co.'s
Canadian subsidiary began striking Saturday, and the union
has threatened to walk away from the bargaining table by
Wednesday if progress isn't made toward a contract
settlement.
   Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers
union, said the two sides were still "miles apart" over
economic issues such as wages, vacations and cost-of-living
allowances. "Another couple of days of this and we'll have to
discuss seriously recessing the talks," he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A breakdown in negotiations likely would drag out the
strike long enough to begin hobbling some of Ford's key U.S.
plants, which depend on parts, especially engines, made in
Canada. Ford has said it would need to begin closing some of
its U.S. operations within two weeks of a Canadian strike.
   Ford Canada spokesman James Hartford said a prolonged
strike could further hurt the company at a time of economic
slowdown and increasingly competitive markets. Ford Canada
has forecast sales in the current model year, which ends
Sept. 30, of 992,000 cars and 453,000 trucks, representing a
decline of 9% from the previous year.
   Mr. Hartford acknowledged that "considerable differences"
separated the two sides. Nevertheless he hinted that the
company could make a new contract offer to the union by early
this week.
   "We want this to be a short strike. Obviously the ball is
in our court," Mr. Hartford said.
   The union began negotiations Sept. 5 after selecting Ford
as a contract target. Since then, the company has made one
contract offer, which was swiftly rejected by the union. The
union claimed the company wasn't offering nearly enough
money. A counteroffer by the union was similarly turned down
by Ford.
   Any contract reached at Ford will serve as the basis for
subsequent negotiations with the Canadian subsidiaries of
General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. Contracts at each of
the Big Three auto makers, covering a total of 61,000 workers
in Canada, expired Friday.
   The strike, the first against Ford in North America since
1976, has shut nine Ford plants in Canada. The largest of
those affected is the company's St. Thomas, Ontario, assembly
plant, which is the sole source for the large Mercury Grand
Marquis and Ford Crown Victoria models.
   In addition, Ford's Windsor, Ontario, engine plant builds
the six-cylinder unit for the Lincoln Continental luxury car.
Company officials said the highly profitable Wixom, Mich.,
plant that builds the Continental likely would be the first
U.S. operation to be hurt by a lengthy strike in Canada.
   Another Ford plant, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, is the sole
provider of auto glass to four of the company's light-truck
assembly operations in the U.S. In all, about 80% of Ford's
Canadian output is exported to the U.S.

   Exemptions Allow Kuwait's Concerns
   In U.S. to Operate Despite Assets Freeze

   NEW YORK -- Six weeks after the government froze Kuwait's
U.S. assets to prevent Iraq from seizing them, Kuwaiti-owned
companies in the U.S. say operations are back to normal
thanks to exemptions granted by the Treasury Department.
   Customers and suppliers of Santa Fe International Corp.,
in Alhambra, Calif., initially expressed concern about
dealing with the Kuwaiti-owned oil drilling company following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, said Vice President John
Mika.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They wanted assurance that they were not violating any
freeze order by continuing their relationship with us," he
said.
   But the Treasury "cooperated quite well with us" in
granting the exemption, which allows the company to continue
writing checks, making payroll and otherwise operate
normally, he said.
   At Georgetown Industries Inc., a Kuwaiti-owned steel
company in Charlotte, N.C., "our business is very much
business as usual," said President Roger Regelbrugge. "We
have no other restrictions than that we are not supposed to
transfer assets to the government of Kuwait or to Iraq," he
said.
   Hilton Hotels Corp., whose Atlanta Hotel &amp; Tower is owned
by the Kuwaiti government, also has had no problems, said a
spokeswoman.
   Estimates of Kuwait's U.S. investments vary from under $10
billion to more than $50 billion because of the nation's
policy of secrecy.
   Kuwait's overall foreign assets last year totaled an
estimated $124 billion, according to DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc.
Much of that is in Europe, and includes such high-profile
investments as a 14% stake in Daimler-Benz AG, the German
auto, electronics and aerospace giant.
   Santa Fe International, which state-owned Kuwait Petroleum
Corp. bought for $2.5 billion in 1981, is believed to be the
Mideast nation's largest single U.S. holding.
   Other known Kuwaiti government assets in the U.S.,
according to the New York-based newsletter MidEast Report and
other sources, include:
   -- Occidental Geothermal Inc. of Los Angeles, which Kuwait
Petroleum bought for $350 million in 1984.
   -- About 12% of Corporate Property Investors, which owns
real estate in New York as well as a number of shopping malls
nationwide.
   -- An undetermined stake in First American Bankshares
Inc., a bank-holding company in Washington.
   -- 45% of the Phoenecian resort in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
which was controlled by scandal-plagued Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan Association until the federal government took over
Lincoln's share.
   -- 45% of the Crescent hotel in Phoenix.
   In addition, private Kuwaiti investors -- not subject to
the asset freeze -- hold an undetermined stake in Investcorp,
which owns Saks Fifth Avenue department stores and other
properties.
   MidEast Report estimates Kuwait's U.S. assets at $50
billion.
   Not even the Treasury Department, charged with enforcing
the asset freeze, has a complete accounting of Kuwait's U.S.
investments. The department began a list after Iraq's
invasion, but had not finished it as of last Friday, a
spokeswoman said.
   The Treasury wouldn't disclose which companies have been
granted exemptions. The spokeswoman said the exemptions were
designed "to allow the Kuwati government to conduct its
normal business in the smoothest way possible while assuring
that no benefits accrue to Iraq."
   The department also has issued general exemptions for
categories of companies, such as telephone and foreign
exchange companies that meet certain conditions.
   According to one measure by the Commerce Department,
Kuwait's direct investments in U.S. companies totaled $4.2
billion last year. That figure doesn't account for
investments made through intermediaries such as Kuwaiti
companies not based in Kuwait.
   Nor does it include investments in companies that result
in less than 10% of the voting stock, nor Kuwait's
"portfolio" accounts of stocks, bonds and other investments
being managed by U.S. investment houses.
   David T. Mizrahi, editor of MidEast Report, estimates 25%
of Kuwait's U.S. assets are held in portfolio accounts at
firms including J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc.
and Citicorp.
   By a broader measure last taken in 1988, the value of all
U.S. companies in which Kuwait held at least 10% control
totaled $10 billion.
   But since that Commerce Department figure includes the
full value of those companies no matter what the size of
Kuwait's stake, it most likely overstates Kuwait's
investment.
   Former Treasury Secretary G. William Miller helps manage
Kuwait's U.S. assets, MidEast Report says. Among Kuwait's
U.S. investment groups is the Wafra Investment Advisory Group
of New York, which invests Kuwaiti pension funds.
   Much of Kuwait's assets world-wide are managed by the
Kuwaiti Investment Office in London.

   Debate Brews Over Japan's Role
   In Supporting Military Efforts

   JAPAN MDEST
</CO>
<LP>
   TOKYO -- An intense debate is brewing here over whether
Japan should dispatch personnel to support multinational
military operations of the sort now aimed at Iraq.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in late August asked the
nation's powerful bureaucrats to draft legislation
authorizing the government to send unarmed personnel to
assist United Nations peacekeeping efforts in global trouble
spots.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But government and political leaders are sharply divided
over the shape of the proposed law, which some regard as a
violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of Japan's
anti-war Constitution. The debate is certain to grow even
hotter when the Diet, or parliament, is called back into
session, probably in October.
   Many officials believe Japan must play a more active role
in international crises if it is to assume a place on the
diplomatic stage commensurate with its economic might. "We
are now working through a rather agonizing {stage} of
transforming ourselves into a really internationally
responsible power, ready to do whatever is appropriate as a
country of this economic size and influence," said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   The proposed law would provide for teams of Japanese
personnel to perform such noncombat functions as
communications and transport for the multinational forces
defending Saudi Arabia. But such issues as lines of command
and whether to include unarmed members of Japan's
Self-Defense Forces, as the army is euphemistically called,
touch a raw nerve in a nation that for 45 years has sought to
extinguish the painful legacy of militarism that led to World
War II.
   Underlying the government's "agony" is a strong current in
Japanese public opinion that foreigners may find difficult to
comprehend. "Generally speaking, I think the population is
very nervous about the military raising its head again," said
Yukihiko Ikeda, a member of parliament from the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, and son of a former prime minister.
   Japanese who grew up before and during the war recall that
the Japanese army made its own foreign policy in the 1930s.
Sidestepping the elected parliament, it declared itself the
army of the emperor and marched into China.
   Under the postwar Constitution, which renounces war, the
Japanese military has had little influence. In recent debates
over Japan's role in the Persian Gulf, for example, officials
of the Japan Defense Agency and the uniformed Self-Defense
Forces have been notable for their absence. Even to this day,
hardly any graduates of Japan's most prestigious universities
make a career in the uniformed services.
   Should the laws or the Constitution be changed to give the
military an overseas role, its influence in bureaucratic
debates and position in society would presumably increase. "I
really wonder if the Americans who are pushing for a Japanese
military presence in the Gulf know what they are doing," said
one Japanese banker who is in his 40s. Said a Japanese
journalist of about the same age: "Don't you have an
expression in English about Pandora's Box?"
   No one suggests that the military would again march off on
its own as it did during the 1930s. But even an increase in
bureaucratic power would be frightening.
   During the debates over Japan's role in the Persian Gulf,
which most recently resulted in Friday's decision to provide
an additional $3 billion to support United Nations sanctions
against Iraq, the Japanese have been treated again to the
unedifying spectacle of individual bureaucracies fighting for
their own institutional interests rather than for the
national good.
   The Finance Ministry, for example, has seemed much more
obsessed with protecting the budget than in contributing to
the Gulf effort. The ministry's power over the purse gives it
considerable influence over the measures Japan has announced.
Japan's government system lacks a strong central executive
capable of overriding powerful individual ministries.
   One senior government source said the proposed
peacekeeping law is unlikely to permit uniformed members of
the Self-Defense Forces to participate in military-related
overseas operations. But some leaders argue for a system
under which Self-Defense Forces could be assigned to
peacekeeping teams answerable directly to the Japanese
Cabinet. Others are lobbying for changes in the law
regulating the Self-Defense Forces, so its members could be
dispatched by the Defense Agency itself.
   In any case, the number of people authorized for the teams
is likely to number in the thousands, the government source
said.
   For now, Japan hopes that its $4 billion in assistance,
which includes $1 billion in aid previously pledged for the
multinational forces, will quiet complaints from the U.S. and
Europe that Japan isn't doing enough to help protect the flow
of oil from the Middle East.
   U.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost, who has publicly urged
Japan to provide more help to the U.S. in the Gulf, welcomed
the large increase in Japan's support package. "This decision
clearly demonstrates that Japan is a full partner in the
ongoing efforts of the international community to work toward
a just and peaceful resolution of the crisis," Mr. Armacost
said.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The former deputy president of P.T.
Bank Duta has been detained by Indonesian police in
connection with investigations of major, unexplained losses
at the bank.
   The Indonesian government, in a bid to deal with the
scandal, appears to be pursuing two separate probes into
dealings at Bank Duta. The Bank is the fifth-largest in the
country. The investigations -- one by the central bank and
one by Attorney General Singgih -- are unlikely to be
completed quickly, observers say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Police, acting on orders of Mr. Singgih, detained Dicky
Iskandar Di Nata on Thursday, who was Bank Duta's deputy
president until he, other managers and the whole board of
supervisors were fired Sept. 4. Although no formal charge has
been placed against him, the 40-year-old Mr. Dicky can remain
in detention for some time under Indonesian law.
   Indonesian newspapers reported that authorities have
seized Mr. Dicky's assets and industry sources close to the
bank say that losses of about $300 million were accumulated.
   Bank Duta's own position has been secured, as the majority
shareholders -- three charity foundations chaired by
President Suharto -- have injected new capital to make good
the losses. But many questions remain about how the losses
were incurred and were kept from supervisors at the central
bank, Bank Indonesia, and minority shareholders of Bank Duta,
which sold shares on the Jakarta Stock Exchange last May.

   Disney to Stop
   Making Dramas
   For Television

   HOLLYWOOD -- Walt Disney Co. has quietly decided to cease
development of hourlong dramatic television shows, giving up
on a business which has been troubled since the mid-1980s.
   Disney will continue to produce half-hour comedies.
Indeed, it has been spending lavishly to attract comedy
writer/producers. It also will continue to produce "The
Magical World of Disney" for NBC as long as the network wants
it. Another new one-hour Disney show for NBC, "Hull High,"
premiered this year and will stay on the air if ratings
permit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Disney's drama development department will be
eliminated and its key executives reassigned, according to
individuals close to the company. The contracts of the
handful of writer/producers in the one-hour field who are
committed to Disney won't be renewed.
   At corporate meetings last week when six-month financial
analyses were studied, executives decided that producing
dramas was too expensive, given the paltry returns. The
situation has existed since 1986, when the bottom fell out of
the rerun syndication market for hourlong shows. Studios had
been taking big losses in producing one-hour shows because
they usually cost well more than $1 million per episode to
produce while the networks would pay only $600,000-$900,000
for the right to air them. Producers would hope to make back
these "deficits" by selling local stations the right to air
reruns, and sometimes it paid off: MCA Inc.'s "Magnum P.I."
reaped nearly $2 million per episode.
   But stations lost interest. The most lucrative reruns for
them are shows they can air weekdays between 4 p.m. and 8
p.m., and viewers seemed to gravitate to lighter fare, such
as game shows and comedies, during those hours. An
award-winning program like "Hill Street Blues" had little
value for station managers, and though producers would try to
cobble together a profit from foreign sales and cable deals,
few succeeded. The only recent drama show with some success
in syndication is Stephen J. Cannell Productions' "Hunter."
   But since shows need to air on the networks for five years
to have optimum syndication value, suppliers were faced with
having to gamble that the market would turn around
eventually, and they continued to produce dramas, slashing
costs and filming in locations outside Hollywood to try to
bring down deficits.
   Last week, Disney said "enough already," an executive
recounted. CBS had ordered a show called "N.Y.P.D. Mounted,"
which would have cost Disney about $1.3 million per episode
to make; CBS was offering just over $900,000. Disney
"refused" the order and the show will be taken over by Orion
Pictures Corp. Disney then decided to bail out entirely.
   Although some studios have been low-key about producing
dramas, like Paramount Communications Inc., Disney is the
first to formally abandon the practice. Disney hadn't even
had a chance to inform the networks before a report leaked to
the Los Angeles Times Saturday. And even though the networks
will always need drama shows for their schedules, they aren't
expected to complain too loudly because Disney, which didn't
have much television presence until recently, is spending so
much to become a force in comedy.

   The New York Mercantile Exchange's new futures contract
for natural gas is turning out to be the most successful
commodity-trading vehicle launched in seven years.
   "Most people in the futures industry have assumed that
growth will continue to come from the financial products.
This contract shows that the potential for growth is much
broader-based," says Thomas Russo, a former attorney at the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission and now a partner at
Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft in New York.

   The contract made its debut in early April, and after five
months daily volume averaged nearly 515 contracts and the
number of contracts outstanding exceeded 9,600. On Aug. 3,
the day after Iraq invaded Kuwait, a record 2,070 contracts
were traded.
   This performance compares favorably with crude oil
futures, which are now the most heavily traded commodity in
the country; only two U.S. futures markets are bigger, and
they are based on financial instruments -- U.S. Treasury
bonds and Eurodollars. Five months after crude oil futures
began trading in 1983, average daily volume was greater than
that for natural gas, 795 contracts, but fewer contracts --
about 6,300 -- were outstanding.
   Nobody expects the new natural gas contract to overtake
crude oil, whose average daily volume of more than 90,000
contracts shot up to more than 120,000 last month. (The
Treasury bond contract on the Chicago Board of Trade averages
more than 300,000 contracts a day, and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's Eurodollar contract averages more than 130,000.)
   One New York Merc official says he thinks that within five
years natural gas could become one of the five most actively
traded contracts in the world. But until then, several other
exchange officials say they'd be happy if natural gas matches
the activity in the Merc's heating oil contract, which this
year is averaging more than 24,000 contracts daily.
   Key to the contract's successful start is that the gas
industry likes the contract and is using it. In late August,
85% of those holding 25 or more contracts overnight were in
the natural gas business in one way or another, the Merc
says.
   "We use it regularly to hedge our positions and
commitments," says Douglas Schantz, vice president for gas
supply at Transco Energy Marketing Co., a Houston marketer
that acts as middleman between some producers and users.
Recently, he says, Transco Energy has been a selling hedger
-- that is, one that sells contracts short to protect
inventory or gas purchases against falling prices. (If the
company wanted to protect itself against rising prices, it
would buy futures.) Mr. Schantz notes that the company
routinely carries out both types of transactions depending
upon its hedging needs.
   Greg Kane, chief financial officer of a New Jersey
exploration and drilling company, says he never doubted the
contract would succeed because natural gas prices are
volatile: The price of the soonest-expiring contract has
swung 22% from high to low since futures trading began after
the winter heating season was over. "It's just a matter of
time before all major participants in the industry become
users of the contract," he predicts.
   And with petroleum supplies in question, a cold winter
could cause trading volume and volatility in the contract to
explode, Mr. Kane says. He considers the coming heating
season to be the ultimate test of the contract's viability.
   Lance Schneier, chairman and chief executive officer of
Access Energy Corp., a Dublin, Ohio, company that markets gas
to 4,500 customers in 30 states, has been a big booster of
the contract. His company offers several new products that
permit customers to fix their buying or selling prices based
on futures prices. In one arrangement, Access places a quote
screen in a customer's office. If the customer sees a price
for a futures month that he likes, he can arrange to buy or
sell from Access at that price plus some differential.
   "He can lock up one month's gas or as many months as he
wants based on what he sees on the screen," Mr. Schneier
says. When a customer makes a commitment, Access hedges the
position in the futures market.
   Some market observers were surprised that gas prices
didn't react much to Middle East tensions. But Mr. Schneier
points out, "Many customers with the ability to switch from
oil to gas started switching before the Iraqi invasion,
causing gas prices to increase in July." He adds that now
with a futures contract for gas, it's easy to see gas prices
move largely on their own. "Oil is an international commodity
while natural gas is a domestic one," he explains.
   The way this industry operates also affects prices, says
Jacob Ulrich, general manager for energy trading at the
Natural Gas Clearing House in Houston, the largest
independent U.S. marketer of natural gas, handling 2.3
billion cubic feet a day. He says his firm uses futures not
only to hedge but also to speculate "if we think futures look
cheap or dear."
   Mr. Ulrich points out that end-users of gas want to fix
the price of their gas needs as early in the heating season
as possible, while producers want to wait as late as they
can, hoping for a price bulge. At this point in the year,
"Most of the marketers of gas have made commitments to
deliver gas but they don't yet own sufficient gas to meet
their obligations," Mr. Ulrich says. "This could lead to a
very bullish situation for futures."
   But the other element of a successful futures contract --
active participation by speculators -- hasn't shown up in
natural gas. "Speculators want action, and the action is in
crude oil," says Robert Baker, energy futures analyst at
Prudential-Bache in New York. Fewer than 2% of those holding
positions of 25 contracts or more overnight are speculators,
according to the Merc. That figure understates speculative
participation because many short-term speculators, known as
"locals," close out their positions daily, and their trading
doesn't show up in position reports.
   "With the hedgers using the contract, we will ultimately
be interested in it," says Keith Campbell, president of
Campbell &amp; Co., a Baltimore commodity trading adviser with
$120 million under management. He says he prefers trading
contracts that have at least three years of price data, but
"if we see the right kind of price movement, we might trade
it sooner."
   Robert Tamiso, a New York adviser who manages about $15
million of private pool money, says he would consider trading
the contract after 120 days of trading data have built up,
which will occur by the end of September. "This is going to
be a successful contract for {speculators} and there is no
question we are going to be trading it," he says.

   N.V. Philips, Seeking to Improve Profits,
   Is Expected to Quit AT&amp;T Joint Venture

   NEW YORK -- Dutch electronics giant N.V. Philips, under
pressure to boost its sagging financial performance, plans to
leave its joint venture with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., according to people close to the venture.
   An AT&amp;T spokesman said reports last week of Philips's
pullout in the Dutch press "are pure speculation at this
point." But sources close to the Hilversum, Netherlands-based
venture, AT&amp;T Network Systems International, said Philips
will announce that it is selling its 15% stake in the company
within the next two weeks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Eindhoven, the Netherlands, a Philips spokesman
declined to comment.
   Meanwhile, Telefonica de Espana S.A. , Spain's national
telecommunications company, has announced plans to take a 6%
stake in the venture, which builds telephone exchanges and
transmission gear for public telephone companies.
   Telefonica will pay for its stake by swapping the 20%
interest it now holds in another AT&amp;T venture, AT&amp;T
Microelectronica Espana, which designs and builds electronic
devices.
   AT&amp;T currently owns 59% of AT&amp;T Network Systems
International while Italy's Stet Group owns 20%. After the
Philips pullout, AT&amp;T will own 74% of the company, although
it is expected to continue to seek European partners.
   AT&amp;T Network Systems International is AT&amp;T's primary
overseas equipment arm. It employs more than 5,000 people and
develops, manufactures and markets the 5ESS digital switch
and assorted transmission gear to foreign phone companies.
Sales in 1989 rose 10% to $600 million while profit jumped
58% to $15 million.
   "Philips's pullout wouldn't be surprising," said Charles
Nichols II, telecommunications analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. "AT&amp;T had hoped that Philips's presence in
electronics would give it an entre into new markets, but
Philips didn't have a big telecommunications presence in
Europe, so AT&amp;T had to go it alone. Plus, Philips is a
financial disaster right now," he added.
   Mr. Nichols said AT&amp;T will probably pay "$60 million to
$90 million max," or no more than one times revenue, for
Philips's remaining 15% stake. He said AT&amp;T remains
well-positioned against European competitors since Italy and
Spain, its major partners, are also two of Europe's
fastest-growing telecommunications markets, with combined
plans to spend more than $30 billion over the next five years
to modernize their phone networks.
   Philips is narrowing its focus to improve its performance.
Because of heavy restructuring costs, the Dutch company
expects a loss of about $1.1 billion for 1990.
   The sale of its stake in the joint venture wouldn't
involve Philips's other telecommunications operations, which
include making office switchboards, mobile phone equipment
and modems. But some analysts believe Philips eventually may
sell its entire telecommunications business, which employs
about 15,000 people.
   The partners, in any case, had drifted apart with AT&amp;T
having taken over most of the management of the venture more
than two years ago. Philips cut its stake to 40% from 50% in
1987 and last year cut it again to 15%, saying it wanted to
focus future investment on its core businesses.
   The venture, originally called AT&amp;T-Philips
Telecommunications, was announced with great fanfare in 1983.
But Western European politicians quickly warned that the
linkup between one of Europe's biggest electronics companies
and mighty AT&amp;T would have a disastrous impact on
competitors.
   However, although the joint venture has proved moderately
successful, competitors such as France's Alcatel N.V.,
Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson and West Germany's Siemens
AG have more than held their own.
   On Friday, AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen and Telefonica
Chairman Candido Velazquez opened a new AT&amp;T Network Systems
plant to build 5ESS switches, in Tres Cantos, Spain, about 10
miles north of Madrid.
   An AT&amp;T spokesman said it "will take the plant about a
year to get up to speed," by which time it is expected to
employ about 900 people.

   Ford Lowers Estimate
   Of Auto, Truck Sales

   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. lowered its estimate for overall
car and truck sales in 1990 amid growing gloom in the auto
industry about the state of the economy.
   Ford, which had forecast the U.S. market at 14.5 million
cars and trucks in 1990, dropped its estimate to 14.3 million
vehicles, said Harold A. Poling, the company's chairman and
chief executive officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Until recently, the industry had been planning for
improved sales in the year's second half, but Mr. Poling said
that now appears unlikely. "We'll have weakness in the fourth
quarter, so we won't have the pickup we hoped for," he said.
He predicted the sluggish sales climate would continue into
1991, but that sales would pick up in the 1991 second half.
General Motors Corp., meanwhile, said it was sticking to its
prediction of 14.5 million vehicles. Chrysler Corp., which
put the market at 14 million to 14.5 million vehicles in
June, has no new forecast, either. But a top Chrysler
official echoed Mr. Poling's worries Friday.
   "A possible downturn in the economy" is a "big concern to
us all," said Robert S. Miller, Chrysler's vice chairman.
   Detroit has reason to brace for a rough period. The jump
in oil prices, resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last
month, already seems to have had a chilling effect on the
U.S. economy. And there's evidence that is hurting car sales.
Overall sales of cars and trucks declined 17% in August from
a year earlier, although sales rebounded somewhat in the
first 10 days of September. The slow sales may translate into
production cuts by auto makers in the fourth quarter, which,
in turn, could drag down the national economy even further.
   When consumers "get nervous, they don't buy cars," said
John Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. "I think
Detroit is facing at least a year of decelerating sales."

   The Outlook:
   Consumers Are Likely
   To Start Cutting Back
   ----

   NEW YORK -- The consumer, many economists have been saying
for some time, has been carrying the burden of keeping the
economy's long expansion going.
   Now, with the Mideast crisis raising oil prices, the
consumer's burden is growing heavier. Other sectors of the
economy are, at best, stagnant.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturing is slipping, and capital-spending plans were
recently trimmed by U.S. companies for the second time this
year. Bruce Steinberg notes in Merrill Lynch's weekly
commentary that "the oil shock may lead to a further paring."
   Investment in housing also is weak. Most baby-boomers are
housed, fewer homes are being bought as sure-fire
investments, and many battered lenders are clamping down on
real-estate loans.
   Exports are chugging along fairly well but probably won't
increase much. The falling dollar should help a bit but may
be offset by a slide in the economies of some major trading
partners. Fearing inflation, they seem likely to curb
economic growth.
   And American governmental bodies at practically all levels
are too debt-burdened to expand their spending significantly.
                                                                                                       

   So, the pivotal role of consumers, who typically account
for two-thirds of economic activity, has gained in
importance. But the trouble is, as Mr. Steinberg notes,
"consumer spending was already in a no-growth recession
pattern before the oil-price shock."
                                                                                                       

   Even before Iraq seized Kuwait, surveys of consumer
sentiment had been showing some weakness. Afterward, the
numbers from both the Conference Board and the University of
Michigan's Survey Research Center plunged, as the chart
shows, and consumers may soon cut back (see accompanying
illustration -- WSJ Sept. 17, 1990).
   Consumers have ample reason to grow wary about spending.
Unemployment is rising, hitting a two-year high of 5.6% of
the civilian work force last month. Manufacturers continued
to cut payrolls, the service sector saw almost no employment
gains outside the health field, and job growth was weaker
than at any time since the last recession. Many people who
lost high-paying jobs in basic industry may be working again,
but only in lower-paying services.
   Consequently, personal income seems likely to start
sagging. In July, even before Iraq struck, consumer debt
expanded at a 7.4% annual rate, the fastest pace since
October. The apparent reason, a lag in debt repayments by
strapped consumers, was hardly reassuring. In addition, the
Federal Reserve is keeping monetary policy relatively tight.
In August, retail sales fell 0.6%.
   And now, economists at Merrill Lynch say, "The oil shock
intensifies existing problems, and we expect consumer
spending to be stagnant in coming months."
   However, they aren't talking disaster. They note that a
$30-a-barrel price for the Saudi benchmark crude is "still
well below the $39-a-barrel level reached in 1979. Indeed, in
real terms, crude oil prices would need to exceed $60 a
barrel to get up to the 1979 level."
                                                                                                       

   Economists at Regional Financial Associates Inc. say
"improved energy efficiency has reduced the vulnerability of
the U.S. economy." They observe that consumption has fallen
to an estimated 4.75 British thermal units per dollar of real
output from 5.25 BTUs in the early 1980s and 5.5 BTUs in the
early 1970s.
                                                                                                       

   The fact that the economy was stronger in 1973 and 1979
makes a difference, too. In those years, says Edward Yardeni,
director of economics at Prudential-Bache Securities, "many
companies were able to pass on the increased costs of
energy," and "the Fed responded to the surge of inflation by
raising interest rates to levels that caused a recession."
   This time, Mr. Yardeni adds, "intense domestic and
international competition, combined with slack demand,
suggest that most of the increase in energy costs will come
out of profits, rather than boost prices." But he warns that
"weak profits could dampen capital spending and trigger
layoffs" and that higher oil prices, by reducing consumers'
purchasing power, "have the same depressing impact on
consumer spending as a tax increase."
   Not surprisingly, most economists have grown more
pessimistic. The consensus of those surveyed monthly by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter,
expects inflation-adjusted gross national product to rise
only 1.1% this year, against a 1.3% forecast in August. For
next year, the predicted increase in real GNP has dwindled to
1.2% from 1.7% a month earlier.
   And in what the newsletter calls "a sharp reversal of
earlier views," 25 of the 50 Blue Chip forecasters now expect
a recession to begin this year. Clearly, they don't see
consumer spending performing any miracles in rescuing the
economy from the effects of higher oil prices or other
problems.

   IBM, Microsoft Expected to Announce
   A Realignment of Roles on OS/2 Work
   ----

<LP>
   International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
are expected to make an announcement soon that will try to
repair differences in their sometimes strained relationship
and clarify their stance on an important personal-computer
issue.
   Industry executives said the companies will realign some
responsibilities for the development of OS/2, an operating
system that both have said is crucial for the future of
personal computers. The software has been a bust thus far,
and the companies have apparently decided that part of the
problem lies in the confusion that can result from the
fragmentation that occurs when development is split among
various sites at two companies. So the companies have decided
to combine some of their work and will each take more
responsibility than the other for certain versions of OS/2.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The executives said the companies will also use the
announcement to try to demonstrate that their relationship
remains strong. While both had initially hung their hopes on
OS/2, in recent months Microsoft had begun pushing its
Windows software, which many in the industry see as a rival
to OS/2. IBM, meanwhile, had begun talking up a version of
OS/2 that it was developing on its own and that Microsoft
didn't appear to be interested in carrying. Now, however,
Microsoft appears likely to carry the OS/2 version that IBM
is pushing. IBM, likewise, insists that it doesn't see
Windows as a threat.
   Neither IBM, Armonk, N.Y., nor Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.,
would comment on whether they would announce anything this
week. However, Jim Cannavino, general manager of IBM's PC
business, said in an interview over the weekend that "we've
looked at ways to be more efficient several times. . . . We
continue to do that." He stressed that he didn't see any rift
developing with Microsoft. "We're working together as we have
in the past," he said.
   Both IBM and Microsoft are clearly worried because an
article in InfoWorld, a trade publication, will hit the
newsstands today saying that IBM is taking control of OS/2
development and that the two companies are, in essence,
headed for divorce court.
   That would be important not only for IBM and Microsoft but
for the whole personal-computer industry, because the
companies have paired to set many of the industry's
standards. A split would cause many software developers and
customers to slow down while they evaluate which company to
follow, and could open the way for companies that support
Unix, a rival operating system.
   "Customers want clear choices," said Philippe Kahn, chief
executive of Borland International, a software company with
links to both IBM and Microsoft. "If there's confusion,
they're just going to back off, and there will be later
acceptance of {OS/2}."
   A preliminary draft of the InfoWorld story, a final
version of which will appear in today's issue, cited sources
as saying IBM is "taking over virtually all OS/2 . . .
development," and quoted insiders calling OS/2 "virtually
dead" at Microsoft.
   InfoWorld's sources said communication between the IBM and
Microsoft technical staffs has stopped, and characterized
this week's expected announcement as formalizing the
IBM-Microsoft "rift."
   But Mr. Cannavino, while not denying an announcement
regarding OS/2, said firmly that the InfoWorld story "is just
not true." Asked specifically about redividing the
responsibilities for OS/2, Mr. Cannavino didn't rule out such
a move but said it wouldn't hurt IBM-Microsoft relations in
any case. "I wouldn't view that as significant from a
relationship point of view," he said.
   The two companies' interests are different enough that any
peace may be uneasy. Microsoft is in the business of selling
software, and it wins whether it sells Windows or OS/2. At
the moment, Windows is shaping up to be a big winner, likely
selling some two million copies this year, while OS/2 sells a
small fraction of that. So Microsoft can be expected to
continue to emphasize Windows at least for the near term.
IBM, however, is mainly in the business of selling
hardware-system software is a minuscule part of IBM's PC
business. IBM hopes to sell networks of dozens or hundreds of
PCs and feels that OS/2, not Windows, is the operating system
that customers will need to glue all those computers
together. So IBM will push its customers, and Microsoft,
toward OS/2.
   IBM and Microsoft did try to patch up their differences on
OS/2 once before, late last year. But all they produced was
an awkward compromise in which they recommended that
customers with a certain minimum amount of memory in their
personal computers use OS/2 while people with less memory use
Windows.

   AMSTERDAM -- Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson N.V. launched an
open-ended mutual fund to invest internationally in companies
involved in cleaning up the environment or preventing
pollution.
   The fund, Environment Growth Fund N.V., is likely to
attract initial investments totaling 50 million guilders
(US$28 million) to 100 million guilders, said Frans J.
Ballendux, head of capital management at Pierson, a merchant
banking arm of ABN Amro Holding N.V. Mr. Ballendux said he
believed the fund would have attracted far more investors had
it not been launched amid stock market turmoil.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The shares, to be listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange,
will be sold at 50 guilders each, and the offering period
ends Sept. 26. New shares will continue to be available after
that date, but investors who buy during the offering period
avoid the 1% stock market commission.
   The fund initially will focus on companies involved in
purification and waste management, Pierson said. As
opportunities arise, however, the fund aims to invest more in
companies providing systems and products that are "friendly"
to the environment.
   Mr. Ballendux said the U.S. offers the most opportunities
for buying environmental stocks at the moment but that Europe
offers bigger long-term potential, particularly given the
huge task of cleaning up pollution in Central Europe.

million in damages for bank actions that allegedly led to
Diversified's liquidation last year.

   International:
   Asahi Breweries to Buy Stake in Elders,
   Easing Cash Woes of Australian Parent

   Officials of Elders IXL Ltd. are toasting an alliance with
Asahi Breweries Ltd. of Japan that should make the
Australia-based beer maker a more-formidable competitor on
the world brewing scene.
   Elders's cash-strapped parent, Harlin Holdings Pty.,
announced late Friday that it has arranged to sell 19.9% of
its approximately 55% holding in Elders to Asahi in a cash
transaction valued at 960 million Australian dollars
(US$793.9 million). At A$2.15 a share, it is a substantial
premium to the A$1.56 at which Elders shares closed on Friday
in Australia. In response, investors bid up the stock eight
British pence to the equivalent of A$1.77 later in London
trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For Harlin, a closely held concern associated with Elders
chairman John Elliott, the sale dilutes its stake in Elders,
but eases its financial bind and buys it some time. For
Elders, it takes pressure off the company to dump assets to
raise cash for bailing out its parent and gives the world's
fourth-largest beer maker an entry into Japan. For
fast-growing Asahi, Japan's second-largest brewer, it marks a
bold step toward international expansion.
   Best known for its Foster's beer, Elders is in the midst
of a corporate overhaul that calls for the sale of its
interests in natural resources, agribusiness and finance. The
company also is to change its name to Foster's Brewing Group
Ltd.
   Harlin is saddled with about A$3 billion of debt incurred
in building its stake in Elders, which is its only asset.
Dividend income from its Elders shares hasn't been enough to
meet interest costs, so Harlin has had to borrow to fund the
shortfall.
   Assuming the transaction with Asahi is approved by Asahi's
board, regulators in Australia and Japan, and Harlin's
creditors, Harlin's stake in Elders will be cut to 35% from
about 55% now. Asahi's cash injection will reduce Harlin's
debt, but based on Elders's expected dividend payments,
Harlin still won't be able completely to cover interest
payments on its debt, Baring Securities (Australia) Ltd.
estimates.
   Before the Asahi transaction, analysts estimated that
Harlin faced an annual funding shortfall of about A$150
million. With the Asahi transaction, the amount could be
halved at most, they say. Moreover, at A$2.15 a share, Harlin
is showing a per-share loss of at least 15 Australian cents
on the sale because it paid an average of A$2.30 a share for
its 55% stake.
   Viktor Shvets, who tracks Elders for Baring Securities,
said that unless Harlin gets a break on its interest bill or
a windfall from Elders in the form of a capital return to
shareholders, the cash-strapped company may have to sell more
of its Elders stake.
   Mr. Elliott, however, dismisses that prospect. In a
telephone interview from Melbourne, he said: "There is no
need for us to sell any {more} shares." Indeed, if Harlin
exercises certain options it holds on Elders shares, its
stake could rise to 46% on a fully diluted basis.
   Mr. Elliott has been shopping for partners to help relieve
Harlin's financial bind, and there had been widespread
speculation that Molson Cos. of Canada, which has a joint
brewing operation with Elders in Canada and separately owns
about 6% of Harlin, would buy a stake in Elders. But a source
familiar with the situation said the proposed Asahi
transaction "supersedes" discussions with Molson.
   In Toronto, Hershell Ezrin, a Molson senior vice
president, said Molson was "delighted" with the Asahi
transaction and its contribution to solving Harlin's
liquidity problems. He also said Molson considers the
proposed move a "plus for Elders."
   Among Harlin's biggest bank creditors, analysts said, are
a syndicate led by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., owed
about A$1.6 billion, and Citibank, owed about A$400 million.
Broken Hill Pty. Co., the giant Australian mining, steel and
oil concern, also is owed about A$880 million in the form of
preference shares that come due in early 1993.
   Later this month, Elders is expected to report a loss for
the year ended June 30 stemming from huge write-downs on
investments. Consequently, some analysts expect Elders will
be forced to trim its annual dividend payout, thus
aggravating Harlin's cash troubles. Mr. Elliott declined to
comment.
   Asahi is expected to appoint two directors to Elders's
reconstituted board, which will have nine or 10 seats. Harlin
is expected to have three directors on the board. An Asahi
spokesman said both companies may brew each other's beer
under license. Asahi already brews Coors of the U.S. and
Lowenbrau of West Germany under license.
   Asahi has been trying to export its Super Dry brand, a hit
in Japan, to other markets, and tying up with Elders will
allow Asahi access to markets in Britain and Canada, as well
as Australia. In Japan, Asahi's sales have been soaring since
Super Dry hit the market three years ago. The company's sales
are expected to reach 750 billion yen ($5.51 billion) this
year, up from 650 billion yen last year.
   Still, Asahi's aggressive move into Elders surprised some
industry analysts in Japan. They said Asahi has been short of
cash after stepping up capital expenditures to increase
production capacity.

   Sprint to Supply
   Soviet Venture
   With Switches

   WASHINGTON -- US Sprint Communications Corp. said it
obtained U.S. government approval to supply a Soviet joint
venture with packet switches that can greatly improve
telecommunications services between the Soviet Union and
other countries.
   The imminent shipment of these switches was announced by
William Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of United
Telecommunications Inc., shortly after completing a visit to
the Soviet Union with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and
the chief executives of other U.S. companies. United
Telecommunications, of Westwood, Kan., is the parent of US
Sprint.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The export license that US Sprint expects to obtain as
early as this week will be the first license for
telecommunications equipment granted by the U.S. under the
new, relaxed regulations for shipping technology to the
Soviet Union, Mr. Esrey said.
   The Soviet venture, Telenet USSR, will be owned by a US
Sprint subsidiary, Sprint International, and the Soviet
Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the Larvian
Academy of Sciences, a Soviet research group.
   The Commerce Department doesn't discuss details of
individual license applications, but Mr. Mosbacher has
publicly supported technology tie-ups between the U.S.
companies represented in his traveling group and potential
Soviet partners.
   US Sprint appears to be leading the race among American
telecommunications companies to establish solid ties in the
Soviet Union. An earlier proposal by U S West Inc. to lay
down part of an international fiber-optic line across the
Soviet Union was rejected by U.S. authorities because of the
advanced nature of the technology.
   US Sprint's packet switches, however, appear to be within
the new standards for permissible exports to the Soviet
Union. The switches are used to route telephone calls and
control traffic in voice, facsimile and digitalized data
transmission. These eight-bit switches are one or two
generations behind the comparable systems in use in Western
countries, but are still good enough to sharply improve the
ability of Sprint's Soviet customers to communicate with
other countries, Mr. Esrey's aides said. The company declined
to discuss the value of its investment or to disclose how
many switches will be sold.
   US Sprint said its venture will operate through new,
dedicated satellite lines that will augment the
often-congested 32 international lines that currently exist
for Moscow-based businesses. Mr. Esrey said he expects the
venture to be in operation before the end of this year.

   NEW YORK -- J. Richard Zecher is returning full time to
his post as chairman of Chase Investor Management Corp., the
money management unit of Chase Manhattan Corp., the bank is
expected to announce today.
   Since late last year, the 50-year-old Mr. Zecher also had
been in charge of global risk management activities for the
bank.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Zecher, who holds a doctorate in economics, said he
agreed at that time to take on the task of pulling together
Chase's various risk management activities in such areas as
foreign exchange, commodities and sophisticated hedging
instruments for corporate clients, as long as the post wasn't
permanent. Risk management involves both trading for the
bank's own account as well as devising hedging programs for
customers seeking protection from volatility in financial and
commodity markets.
   "We had those in several different administrative parts of
the bank and we wanted them pulled together," said Mr.
Zecher. "But I didn't want to do that permanently so I
retained my chairmanship at CIMC and I'm returning there full
time now. It's a business I helped create and it's doing very
well." Chase Investor Management manages approximately $33.5
billion for pension funds and other institutional clients.
   Mr. Zecher said Mark B. Grier, 38 years old, currently
head of financial management for Chase's retail operations,
will succeed him as the bank's global risk management
executive. Mr. Grier previously was chief financial officer
at Lincoln First Bank in Rochester when Chase acquired that
bank.

   NEW YORK -- American Home Products Corp. is expected to
announce today that it acquired the rights to one of the more
promising experimental vaccines being tested for AIDS.
   The consumer products and pharmaceutical company, whose
Wyeth-Ayerst division is one of the country's largest drug
makers, has agreed to help MicroGeneSys Inc. develop its
VaxSyn HIV-1 product, according to officials at both
companies. VaxSyn is one of three AIDS vaccines under
especially intense study, and, of the three, has undergone
the most advanced human tests.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Officials at both companies declined to provide exact
financial details of the transaction. But an official at
closely held MicroGeneSys said that American Home made a
"substantial investment" in the small West Haven, Conn.,
company. American Home is also expected to make significant
payments to MicroGeneSys if the vaccine should clear certain
scientific hurdles over the next few years.
   The acquisition immediately makes American Home one of the
more important players among large U.S. drug makers seeking
therapies for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Previously, the company hadn't been involved in any
AIDS-related project of note. MicroGeneSys, which was formed
to develop an AIDS vaccine, now has a powerhouse drug company
behind it -- as do the other contending vaccine developers --
to fuel the heavy costs of human trials.
   Merck &amp; Co. has a similar arrangement with Repligen Corp.,
a Cambridge, Mass., company. A significant share of Genentech
Inc. of South San Francisco recently was acquired by
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. already
owns Oncogen of Seattle. Repligen, Genetech and Oncogen are
developing AIDS vaccines somewhat similar to the one created
by MicroGeneSys.
   "The arrangement gives us access to Wyeth's expertise in
moving the product through the (Food and Drug Administration)
approval process as well as necessary funding to carry out
the studies," said Franklin Volvovitz, chairman and president
of MicroGeneSys.
   Mr. Volvovitz said the company began searching for a
partner earlier this year when it realized that the small
company couldn't fund "all the studies to meet federal
government's demands" and that "the government wasn't going
to provide the funds we needed.
   The agreement with American Home comes just three months
after scientists at Johns Hopkins University medical school
reported the results of tests in which VaxSyn boosted the
ability of blood cells to seek out and kill cells infected
with the AIDS virus. The vaccine was given to healthy
volunteers, and their blood was then tested against the virus
in test-tube studies. Earlier in the year, researchers at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center reported that the product
boosted some aspects of the immune system of a handful of
AIDS patients.
   VaxSyn is a subunit vaccine that is made from one protein,
called gp160, on the surface of the AIDS virus. Scientists
believe this protein alone may stimulate the body's defense
to fight off the virus. MicroGeneSys is testing its product
both as a vaccine to prevent infection and as a treatment for
people already infected. VaxSyn was the first vaccine product
to gain FDA approval for human tests in 1987.
   In the past year, VaxSyn has gained increasing interest
among AIDS researchers, and it is the subject of several
reports expected to be released next month at an
International AIDS meeting in Florida.

Brook Street Bureau employment services units that formed
part of the original Blue Arrow group which bought
Milwaukee-based Manpower Inc. in 1987.

   Manpower will receive the payment in cash, though it has
promised to reinvest #2 million in variable-rate non-voting
preference shares. The exact consideration is subject to an
audit of the sold properties.
   Mitchell Fromstein, who headed Manpower at the time of
Blue Arrow's hostile bid and who last year gained control of
the merged companies in a board-room coup, has set about
restructuring the debt-burdened company. Along with the name
change, he has proposed reincorporating the company in the
U.S.
   Manpower said the sale reflects its desire to focus its
operations in the U.K. temporary help market under a single
brand name and eliminate competition among wholly owned units
of the company.

   NEW YORK -- PolyGram NV said it will have satisfactory
increases in net sales and a "successful" 1990 year.
   Speaking to the New York Society of Security Analysts,
PolyGram officials would not disclose their expectations for
1990 earnings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   David Fine, president and chief executive, told analysts
that he expects "very satisfactory increases in net sales"
for the year.
   Chief Financial Officer Jan Cook said "we look forward to
a successful full year for PolyGram."
   The Dutch music firm saw its earnings decline in the first
half of 1990 as it absorbed the costs of assimilating and
integrating Island International Ltd. and A &amp; M Records Inc.
Both record companies were acquired by PolyGram in 1989.
PolyGram is 80%-owned by N.V. Philips
   Fine said the acquisitions will help boost U.S. sales --
an area the company has targeted for much of its future
growth. He added the company's dominance in Europe will give
it an advantage in exploiting a growing East European music
market.

   Philippine's Economic Woes May Damp
   Demands for U.S. Military Withdrawal

   MANILA -- The first round of formal talks for a new treaty
covering U.S. military bases in the Philippines starts this
week amid an economic downturn that is expected to undercut
nationalist demands for a rapid U.S. withdrawal. Still, a
gradual reduction of the forces remains likely.
   Talks on the bases in May, which were described as
exploratory, came as the Cold War was collapsing, prompting
predictions that the U.S. wouldn't be averse to relinquishing
the bases. But more recently, the U.S. military buildup in
the Persian Gulf and an accelerating slide in the Philippine
economy have altered the context of the talks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say these changing conditions have increased both
sides' interest in reaching a new agreement that would
provide for a gradual reduction of U.S. forces, with the
possibility that the forces would continue to use Philippine
facilities on a commercial basis.
   The negotiations between panels headed by Philippine
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus and U.S. special envoy
Richard L. Armitage, a former assistant secretary of defense,
are expected to begin tomorrow in Manila. The talks will
focus on time and money: how long Manila will permit U.S.
forces to remain and how much Washington will pay for the
privilege.
   The current agreement, signed in 1966, expires in
September 1991, and Manila has already given formal notice
that U.S. troops should withdraw by that date unless a new
treaty is signed. There are about 16,000 U.S. troops in the
Philippines, the third-largest U.S. military contingent in
Asia after those in Japan and South Korea.
   For the U.S., the Gulf crisis has highlighted the
importance of maintaining a network of foreign bases despite
the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and sharply
diminished perceptions of a Soviet threat. "It's pretty
obvious that the Americans have tried to depreciate the value
of the bases in the Philippines," says Filipe Miranda, a
professor of political science at the University of the
Philippines. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2,
however, there has been increased recognition in the U.S.
"that the value of the bases is quite great," he adds.
   Recent massive U.S. deployments to Saudi Arabia didn't
pass through the Pacific, but moved from the East Coast.
Nonetheless, U.S. bases in the Philippines are being used to
supply the Gulf forces, a role that is likely to expand if
the Mideast standoff continues, U.S. sources say. More
generally, analysts say Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has
increased awareness in both Manila and Washington of the
greater potential for regional threats to peace since the end
of the Cold War.
   U.S. officials say they want to retain the bases as long
as possible under an agreement acceptable to both sides, but
they acknowledge that nationalist sentiment makes an
indefinite U.S. military presence highly unlikely. "There are
legitimate nationalist instincts," says a U.S. official. "The
challenge of the talks is to merge our interests with
Philippine nationalism."
   Adds an Asian diplomat: "An indefinite stay is already
out. The only thing to be decided is the {transition}
period."
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Subcomittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, said a week ago
that he talked with U.S. negotiators before their departure
for Manila and believed they would propose a 10-year
extension that would include a gradual U.S. phaseout.
   However, a source close to the U.S. Embassy in Manila says
the U.S. negotiating team won't offer a withdrawal, even on a
10-year timetable.
   For the Philippines, the Gulf crisis is only the latest in
a string of natural and man-made disasters that have battered
the economy in the past year, making it more dependent on
benefits that derive from Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval
Station and four smaller U.S. military facilities.
   Reeling from a sixth coup attempt last December, drought,
typhoons, an earthquake and floods, the government of
President Corazon Aquino has repeatedly been forced to reduce
its 1990 growth targets. Gross national product is now
officially projected to expand 3.8% this year, well below the
6% growth in output of goods and services that government
planners say is necessary to alleviate poverty and provide
jobs for a swelling population. Even so, private analysts say
the government's GNP figures are still overly optimistic.
   The Mideast crisis has dealt the Philippines a double
blow, bringing higher oil prices while cutting remittances
from the estimated 65,000 Filipinos who were working in Iraq
and Kuwait at the time of the invasion. Workers returning
from the Gulf will only exacerbate unemployment. This
economic squeeze has fortified the arguments that the
Philippines can't afford to turn out the Americans.
   Under a 1988 accord, President Ronald Reagan agreed to ask
Congress for a total of $962 million as payment to Manila for
use of the bases during the two years ending in September
1991. Congress appropriated only $385 million for 1990, $96
million short of one year's payment, and Manila and
Washington are currently engaged in a dispute over the
discrepancy. Still, the U.S. payment represents a substantial
cash infusion for the strapped Aquino government.
   More significant for the economy are business and
employment spinoffs from the bases, which U.S. officials
estimate at about $1 billion a year, or roughly 3% of
Philippine GNP. The bases employ 78,000 Filipinos, a payroll
second only to that of the Philippine government.
   To counter concerns about economic dependence on the
bases-and perhaps to strengthen the Philippines' negotiating
position-the government's Bases Council has proposed that
Clark be converted into an international airport and cargo
facility and that Subic Bay become a commercial ship-repair
facility, with the U.S. Navy as a major client.
   The Bases Council has suggested that the conversion be
financed by shifting Philippine military camps from Manila to
Clark and selling the prime real estate they now occupy in
the capital for an estimated 50 billion pesos ($2.07
billion). Even supporters of the conversion plan, however,
acknowledge that it couldn't be implemented before the
current agreement expires next year.
   Nationalist sentiment against the bases remains strong,
particularly among the political elite. Analysts question
whether any treaty providing for an extended U.S. presence
could win two-thirds endorsement from the 23-member
Philippine Senate, as required by the country's constitution.
   Philippine negotiators have refused to divulge their
objectives in the negotiations, insisting that it is up to
the U.S. to present proposals. Economics will clearly be on
their minds, however.
   Alfredo Bengzon, the panel's vice chairman, said recently
that the Philippine negotiators would examine U.S. proposals
from three perspectives: "First, the aspect of what is
politically acceptable to us. Second, from the aspect of what
is economically bearable. And third, from the aspect of what
serves the needs of both the Philippines and the United
States."

   Nestle S.A. of Switzerland, a foods concern, said its
first-half net income declined 4.7% to 975 million Swiss
francs ($747.7 million) from 1.02 billion francs a year
earlier. Analysts had expected an increase.
   Consolidated cash flow rose 7.9% 1.98 billion francs.
Trading profit rose 9.8% to 2.21 billion francs. Consolidated
profit before taxes rose 12% to 1.8 billion francs. Net
income declined mainly because of an increase in taxes to 752
million francs from 611 million francs, and the negative
influence of currency rates, Nestle said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nestle previously posted a first-half decline in group
sales to 22.7 billion francs from 22.8 billion francs.
   Nestle also said its outlook for the year is unclear,
owing to uncertainties about the political and economic
situation internationally and currency developments. Some
analysts had forecast an annual earnings rise of 3% to 10%
from 2.41 billion francs in 1989, but now view a decline of
5% as probable, mainly because of currency fluctuations and
higher-than-expected taxes.

   Can Sue Over Retaliatory Firings

   An appeals court in Illinois has ruled that in-house
lawyers can sue companies that have fired them in retaliation
for giving unwanted advice.
   The ruling, by the Appellate Court of Illinois, is
believed to be among the first to give staff lawyers the
right to sue employers for retaliatory discharge. The case
had been closely watched by in-house lawyers and legal ethics
experts because courts in Illinois and Texas had ruled that
in-house lawyers could not sue employers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The case involves Roger J. Balla, an in-house lawyer fired
in 1985 by Gambro Inc., a distributor of kidney dialysis
equipment. Before he was fired, Mr. Balla had told the
company that a shipment of dialyzers was "misbranded and/or
adulterated," according to the court opinion.
   A lower court ruled that Mr. Balla could not pursue his
retaliatory discharge claim against Gambro, now based in
Lakewood, Colo., its German parent and Swedish affiliate. But
the appeals court said that Mr. Balla could pursue his claim,
even though other courts had refused to allow in-house
attorneys to sue on such grounds "fearing that the attorneys
would breach their fiduciary duty by disclosing their
client's confidential information."
   "The sanctity of the attorney-client privilege is not an
absolute bar to disclosure," the court ruled, when "public
policies" or "serious bodily harm" are at stake.
   Mr. Balla's suit against Gambro will be heard by a lower
court.
   Arthur Sternberg, the Chicago lawyer who represents
Gambro, said his client will seek to appeal. He said the
decision makes in-house lawyers "second-class citizens"
because it will encourage companies to limit their "use of
in-house attorneys to more mundane types of tasks rather than
putting them in sensitive situations." He said the dialyzers
were "not defective in any way."
   Alan O. Amos, the Chicago lawyer for Mr. Balla, said the
decision shows that in-house lawyers have "the same rights
that any other employee would have under the same
circumstances." He said the decision will discourage
companies from hiding behind the attorney-client privilege.
   The American Corporate Counsel Association (ACCA), a trade
group, has taken the position that in-house lawyers should
not be able to sue their employers, according to board member
Lawrence A. Salibra. But ACCA will consider the issue again
at its annual meeting in November, said Mr. Salibra, senior
counsel at Alcan Aluminium Corp.

   SEC DROPS BID for spot on Drexel creditors' committee.
   Instead, the Securities and Exchange Commission has
aligned itself with a court-sanctioned group of
securities-litigation claimants suing Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc.
   The SEC moved to join the creditors' committee soon after
Drexel filed for bankruptcy-law protection on Feb. 13. The
SEC is owed $150 million as part of Drexel's settlement of
charges against the company last year. Although that claim
makes the SEC one of Drexel's largest creditors, the motion
sparked controversy because of a dispute over whether
bankruptcy law allowed a regulatory agency to serve in that
role.
   Now, however, the SEC says its interests are better
represented through the newly formed securities litigation
claimants group. The group will negotiate with Drexel and the
creditors' committee over how to provide for litigation
claims in the company's bankruptcy reorganization plan. More
than 400 suits are pending against Drexel.
   The group includes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which is expected to file a huge claim against Drexel
stemming from the failure of several savings and loans. The
group also represents investors who have filed class-action
suits against Drexel and Michael Milken, the company's former
junk-bond chief. The group, which isn't an official
bankruptcy committee, was approved in a court order by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III last month.
   Richard Kirby, the SEC's senior litigation counsel, said
the agency joined the litigation group because of the
importance of addressing the eventual claims that Drexel will
have to pay. The SEC's $150 million claim is meant to be
distributed to investors who were hurt by alleged wrongdoing
by Drexel. In a reorganization plan for Drexel, the money
could be combined with other payments by Drexel to set up a
fund for litigation claimants.
   "This case can't progress toward a feasible reorganization
plan" until an estimate is reached on the litigation claims,
Mr. Kirby said.
   In court filings, Drexel and the creditors' committee
agreed to negotiate with the litigation group to develop a
process for estimating the claims. They also said they will
include the group in negotiating a reorganization proposal.

   CRAVATH HAS LOST General Development Corp. as a client.
   Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore, a New York law firm, and the
troubled Miami real-estate developer said the parting of ways
was mutual and had been planned since the spring. In the 13
months ended April 30, the company paid Cravath $4.8 million,
the law firm said.
   General Development was indicted in March on federal
felony charges of defrauding thousands of home buyers and was
subsequently placed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings.
Some critics, including Miami Beach attorney Paul Steinberg,
who represents certain General Development shareholders,
assert that Cravath ought to be held liable for advising
General Development that its marketing practices were legal
and sound.
   Meanwhile, two General Development directors said they
will call for an independent review of Cravath's legal
representation to assess whether the law firm acted
responsibly. The directors -- Chairman Charles J. Simons and
Chesterfield Smith -- said they are not alleging impropriety,
but rather feel an independent investigation is a sound
fiduciary move in light of criticism of Cravath.
   Ronald Rolfe, a Cravath partner, said "We think Cravath
has no liability or potential liability at all." Paul Dodyk,
who was Cravath's lead counsel for the company, declined to
comment.
   Mr. Smith, whose Miami law firm, Holland &amp; Knight, is
slated to succeed Cravath as lead counsel, said "it is in the
interest of all concerned to ascertain if the allegations are
substantial or insubstantial." The company's board hasn't yet
formally considered an independent inquiry, which would
review the roles of all involved parties -- not just Cravath,
Mr. Simons said.
   General Development had a close relationship with Cravath;
its former chairman, David F. Brown, who is facing federal
fraud charges, was a former associate at the firm and then
became general counsel to City Investing, a Cravath client,
before going to General Development.
   Cravath will continue representing the company in three
matters, it said.

   STATE JUDGE REJECTS ethics charges against a chemical
firm's lawyers.
   Travelers Indemnity Co. of Hartford had alleged that
lawyers for Stauffer Chemical Co. tried to prevent potential
witnesses from testifying in a suit concerning who should pay
for a cleanup of toxic waste.
   The company named in the suit is now a unit of ICI
Americas Inc., of Wilmington, Del., and is called Stauffer
Management Co. A company currently called Stauffer Chemical
Co. is not involved.
   The Travelers Corp. unit, a plaintiff, alleged Stauffer
lawyers violated ethics rules when they sent letters urging
former employees to call Stauffer lawyers at the Wilmington
law firm of Morris, Nichols, Arsht &amp; Tunnell, the Washington
law firm of Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart, or the Philadelphia law
firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius if they were contacted by the
insurance companies.
   In a ruling last week, Judge Vincent J. Poppiti of
Wilmington wrote that Travelers failed to prove that the
letters prevented the insurer from obtaining information that
would otherwise be available. He said he would refer the
matter to counsel for a lawyers' disciplinary board.
Stauffer's lawyers declined to comment.
   In a separate order, Judge Poppiti wrote that Jeffrey A.
Januzzo and Pamela G. Ostrager, lawyers at the New York firm
of Coudert Brothers, which is representing Travelers, had
misled him about the practices of investigators working on
behalf of the insurer. Stauffer had alleged that the
investigators failed to properly identify themselves to
former employees. The judge terminated the lawyers' right to
appear before the court.
   The Coudert lawyers declined to comment. In a prepared
statement, Mark Lebow, head of Coudert's litigation
department, said, "Two of the most respected ethics experts
in this country, Professor Stephen Gillers of New York
University and Professor Geoffrey Hazard of Yale University,
filed affidavits with the Delaware court attesting that the
conduct of the Coudert Brothers lawyers was ethical." A
Travelers spokesperson said they would appeal.
   Judge Poppiti also ordered Travelers to turn over to
Stauffer any statements obtained from former Stauffer
employees and said they would not be admissible at the trial,
set for February 1991.

   PENNY-STOCK INVESTIGATION NETS three more F.D. Roberts
officers.
   Three former owners of F.D. Roberts Securities Inc. last
week pleaded guilty to federal felony charges in connection
with their roles in a high-pressure penny-stock scam.
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Newark obtained guilty pleas
from Fred Galiardo, former F.D. Roberts board chairman; Alan
Lieb, former vice president in charge of trading and a
director; and John Perfetti, a former vice president in
charge of trading and a director. The three are among the 25
F.D. Roberts brokers and officers who have either pleaded
guilty or been convicted on charges stemming from the
two-year federal investigation.
   The three pleaded guilty to federal racketeering,
securities, mail fraud and wire fraud charges. Mr. Galiardo
and Mr. Lieb face maximums of 20 years in prison and fines
equal to twice their gain or their victims' loss and
restitution. Mr. Perfetti faces 10 years in prison and a
maximum of $100 million in fines.
   James Galdieri, Mr. Lieb's attorney, said that his client
"accepts full responsibility for his wrong act." A lawyer for
Mr. Perfetti declined to comment. Mr. Galiardo's lawyer could
not be reached.

   Sales of `Scatter' Ad Time
   Go Slow for TV Networks

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- For the first time in years, the major
television networks have their hands full of unsold ad time
in the so-called scatter market for the fourth quarter, a
sign broadcasters aren't going to escape the cutbacks
plaguing other media.
   The scatter market consists of ad time left over from the
"upfront" selling season, the period each summer when
advertisers commit big chunks of money to reserve ad time for
the fall season. Ads in the scatter market, which generally
sell at higher prices, usually get snatched up as soon as the
upfront buying ends. All ad time for the fall season -- both
upfront and scatter -- has historically been locked up by the
end of August.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But August is long gone, and ad agency media directors are
astounded at the availability of advertising time across the
schedule, including daytime TV, late-night and sports
programming. There is even available ad time on some of the
most-promising and highly rated primetime programs. The
amount of time varies within the schedule of each network,
but most executives say there is still ad time for sale even
in the desirable period just before Christmas.
   "It's been a long time since the fourth quarter has been a
buyer's market," says Lou Shultz, executive vice president
and director of media services at Lintas: USA. Adds Gene
DeWitt, president of DeWitt Media in New York: "It's highly
unusual that, at this late date, you can buy almost anything
you want. You can almost drive a truck through the
availabilities."
   Mr. DeWitt and other media executives say the ad time
isn't being bought because advertisers are concerned about
their own profitability amid a shaky economy and fears of the
effects of the crisis in the Middle East. "We're seeing
clients commit their ad dollars almost one at a time," Mr.
DeWitt says.
   The upfront market this year was expected to be a great
deal healthier than last year, when advertisers committed
about $4.2 billion. This year, however, sales turned out to
be relatively flat, although ABC and Fox Broadcasting Co.,
the News Corp. unit, registered gains at the expense of
rivals NBC and CBS.
   Media experts see the ailing scatter market as the latest
in a long string of blows the media business has weathered
this year. Although experts say they have seen countless
advertisers cut their magazine, newspaper and outdoor ad
budgets, a number thought broadcast television, with its
appeal as the preferred medium to reach a vast audience with
one shot, would escape the cuts.
   "It's unusual, but I guess it's not all that surprising,"
says Richard Kostyra, executive vice president and director
of media services at J. Walter Thompson. "You read the
headlines these days and you know that everything's being
affected."
   Network executives, not surprisingly, aren't too eager to
talk about their high inventories of ad time. H. Weller
"Jake" Keever, executive vice president of sales at ABC, a
unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., would say only, "We hope by
mid-November that clients will release their budgets."
Executives close to ABC say the network's October market is
pretty well sold, but that its November and December
schedules are riddled with openings.
   Executives at CBS Inc. weren't available for comment. But
at NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., executives confirmed
sales of scatter ad time are off to a slow start there, too.
They blamed the uncertain economy and anxious advertisers for
the sales lag.
   "We've had a little bit of a late year," say Larry
Hoffner, executive vice president of network sales at NBC.
"We're hopeful at this point. It's still early for the
mid-November to Christmas push."
   But media executives say that, based on previous years'
experience, it is not early. What's more, the executives say
the availabilities in some parts of the schedule are so wide
open that the networks are offering some ads in the scatter
market at the cheaper upfront rates.
   "If an advertiser has flexibility, he could cut some very
good deals," says Bill Croasdale, executive vice president
and director of national broadcast at Backer Spielvogel
Bates. "In some isolated cases, you might even be able to
beat the upfront prices."
   Scatter prices are traditionally higher than upfront
prices in part because advertisers are penalized for waiting
until late in the selling season to make buys. But the
scatter market is popular among advertisers that don't want
to make a long-term commitment or among those interested in
launching a new product on short notice.
   If the price-cutting is good news for advertisers, it's
devastating news for the networks. NBC's Mr. Hoffner, though,
says he believes the market for scatter will still be strong,
if not right away. He says he believes the negotiation
processes in buying ad time have become more complex and have
as a result changed the timing of the ad-selling seasons.
   Still, media experts warn that advertisers seeing these
cheaper scatter rates may question their future upfront
buying strategies if the situation continues into next year.
   "If the softness continues, advertisers clearly will
reduce their upfront commitment," says Mr. Kostyra of J.
Walter Thompson. The upfront commitments will still be major,
he says, because the networks only offer "guarantees" of the
number of viewers on upfront buys. "But I think advertisers
will retain a larger portion {than they did before} for the
scatter."

   Major Arms Sale to Saudis
   Recommended by Pentagon

   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is recommending arms sales to
Saudi Arabia that could eventually total as much as $20
billion, a Bush administration official said.
   The official stressed, however, these military sales
essentially are in two distinct categories: those that answer
Saudi Arabia's immediate security needs and those that would
help safeguard its long-term interests.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The official rejected the notion that this was a single
transaction. "It isn't one big package," and he stressed that
"the size of some sales will depend on how the situation (in
the Persian Gulf) unfolds."
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait, the U.S. has so far
agreed to sell Saudi Arabia 24 F-15 jet fighters at a cost of
about $2.3 billion. These are expected to come out of U.S.
inventory and should be delivered quite quickly, the
administration official said.
   Future sales to Saudi Arabia are expected to include such
items as Apache helicopters, M-1 tanks, Bradley Fighting
Vehicles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Patriot air
defense systems.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials reacted with concern to
the prospects of a large U.S. arms sale to the Saudis. "We
object to this kind of arms deal and find it a threat," said
one official. The potential volume, number and sophistication
of the weapons under consideration could "affect the
qualitative edge" the Israeli forces rely on to deter an Arab
attack.

   Kuwaitis Rush
   To Saudi Arabia
   As Border Opens

   DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia -- As many as 3,000 Kuwaiti refugees
streamed into northern Saudi Arabia over the weekend, and
thousands more reportedly were heading for the border in
makeshift caravans after Iraq suddenly allowed free passage
for some residents from occupied Kuwait.
   The border crossing at Al Khafji, the traditional seaside
transit point between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, was reopened
without warning on Saturday and again early yesterday
morning, Saudi officials said. Some of the Kuwaiti refugees
said they rushed to the border after hearing broadcasts on
Voice of America that the gate had been opened.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The flow of refugees had slowed to a trickle in the past
few weeks as Iraqi soldiers stepped up efforts to catch
Kuwaiti families fleeing across the desert. Saudi officials
said they expect the border crossing to be reopened at least
for part of today, though they haven't received any official
word.
   Yesterday's about-face by Iraq threatens to complicate the
situation for both the Saudi government and exiled Kuwaiti
leaders, especially if large numbers of refugees continue
pouring into the northeastern corner of this country.
Concerned about the potential for terrorists or spies to
infiltrate Saudi Arabia, military and government officials
quickly enacted procedures to carefully interrogate all the
refugees -- some of whom said their passport and other
identification papers were taken by Iraqi soldiers.
   Other refugees, according to Saudi officials, recounted
stories of Iraqi troops taking their jewelry, video equipment
and other valuables before allowing them to cross into Saudi
Arabia.
   Saudi officials said that thousands of vehicles from
Kuwait were headed toward the border yesterday evening, when
the Iraqis closed the border as quickly as they had opened it
more than 12 hours before.
   It's too early to tell whether Iraq's moves are part of a
broader strategy to try to gain international support, but
some Saudi officials are concerned that the outflow of people
could weaken the resistance movement in Kuwait.
   By allowing disaffected Kuwaitis to escape, this theory
goes, Saddam Hussein may be setting the stage to install more
of his people into key business posts and other jobs in the
occupied country. Moreover, Saudi officials fear that some of
the refugees could be entering to help provoke dissent among
Saudi Arabia's large Shiite minority, which fills many of the
jobs in the oil fields.
   Saudi border guards said that some of the Kuwaiti families
were allowed to leave, but their servants and other non-Arab
domestic helpers weren't allowed to cross into Saudi Arabia.
   Some 250,000 Kuwaiti refugees previously escaped to Saudi
Arabia, and taking care of another large influx could stress
Saudi facilities. "We simply don't know why the border is
suddenly open, or how long it will stay open," one senior
Saudi military official said. "But we are taking precautions
to protect ourselves."

   Sears Launches
   New Steps in Bid
   To Reduce Costs

   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. launched a new round of
cost cuts, eliminating the jobs of four key executives and
offering cash incentives to 600 administrative staff
employees to leave their jobs.
   A spokesman said Sears is reviewing another 1,400
administrative jobs at its headquarters here and may offer
"reorganization incentives" to some of those employees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The steps signal that Chairman Edward A. Brennan is trying
to reduce costs this year as he had indicated when he took
day-to-day control of the faltering Sears merchandise group
last month. Just a year ago, Sears completed a massive
reorganization of the unit, but sales have been sluggish and
profits have fallen since then.
   Sears officials wouldn't comment on how much they expect
to save, but analysts said they don't expect the figure to be
substantial. Instead, the analysts viewed the moves as
largely symbolic. "I'm glad to see they understand their cost
problem is as much a management problem as anything else,"
said Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities.
   The posts of two merchandising senior executive vice
presidents were eliminated and two other senior executives
retired and weren't replaced. In addition, two top
merchandising executives, Thomas E. Morris, 43, and Jerry A.
Hand, 50, resigned unexpectedly.
   The two executives whose jobs were cut, Matthew A. Howard
and Eric D. Saunders, aren't leaving Sears. They assumed the
responsibilities of Messrs. Morris and Hand, who had overseen
marketing and home fashions, respectively. Neither Mr. Morris
nor Mr. Hand could be reached for comment.
   Sears said only that the two men resigned to "pursue other
interests." But Mr. Brennan was understood to have carefully
reviewed all of the executives' performances, suggesting that
he was especially disappointed with the company's advertising
programs. Mr. Howard's new title, senior vice president of
marketing, also signals that Sears considers him more of a
heavyweight than Mr. Morris.
   Mr. Morris presided over last year's launch of Sears's
"everyday low pricing policy," which failed to stimulate
sales or reduce expenses, as expected. Moreover, the launch
was accompanied by an advertising blitz that some insiders
now acknowledge probably confused consumers. Sears touted the
program as "a sale that never ends."
   Mr. Morris's resignation comes at a time when three ad
agencies are understood to be putting together pitches for
the big Sears ad account. The Ogilvy &amp; Mather unit of WPP
Group PLC currently handles the account and has been assured
by Sears that it isn't conducting a review. The Sears
spokesman said Mr. Morris's departure doesn't signal a change
in agencies.
   The retiring executives are Con S. Massey, 53, senior vice
president for human resources and administration, and Vern L.
Page, 60, vice president for catalog merchandising.
   Sears said it is combining four of its merchandise group
and corporate headquarters administrative departments. They
are personnel, planning, law and public affairs. Now under
review are the company's finance departments and other
administrative functions.
   Managers who take the cash incentive will receive two
week's salary for every year of service. Non-managers will
get a week's salary for every year of service.

   BETHESDA, Md. -- Scientists at the National Institutes of
Health began the first human-gene therapy experiment, taking
a step that many hope will change the face of medicine.
   A four-year-old girl suffering from a genetic disorder
called ADA deficiency, a rare and devastating malfunction of
the immune system, was given an infusion of cells containing
copies of a gene she lacks. She is missing the ADA gene,
which manufactures an enzyme that clears wastes from the
body. Scientists hope the adenosine deaminase genes they have
inserted into the unidentified girl's bloodstream will begin
producing the missing enzyme and rebuild her immune system.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It will be several months before the doctors, French
Anderson of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and
Michael Blaese and Kenneth Culver of the National Cancer
Institute, know whether, or how well, the experiment works.
But the initial infusion went well, scientists and the girl's
father said.
   The doctors will monitor the patient, as well as several
other children who will have similar infusions later, to
learn how long the cells containing copies of the ADA gene
will survive in the girl's bloodstream and how much her
immune system improves.
   An NIH panel cleared the path-breaking therapy in late
July after lengthy review and the Food and Drug
Administration gave its approval just hours before the
infusion Friday.
   Gene therapy may ultimately help treat or cure a wide
range of diseases and disorders, including cancer, cystic
fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, certain types of arthritis and
some mental disorders.

   MIT Appeal on Magnet Lab
   Is Dismissed by Foundation

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Directors of the National Science
Foundation dismissed Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
appeal of the decision to establish the new national magnet
center at Florida State University.
   The NSF's selection of the Florida school last month
shocked MIT, which has been home to the world's leading
magnet laboratory, and chagrined many scientists who worry
that access to top notch laboratory facilities in the U.S.
will be lost for several years while Florida State builds up
its lab.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   MIT said that its Francis Bitter National Magnet
Laboratory, the national laboratory since 1960, will have to
be closed. NSF is providing $6 million in annual funding
through next year. But with the laboratory going to Florida,
researchers are likely to drift away from MIT and may
postpone long-term projects until the new lab is established.
   MIT has orchestrated a major letterwriting campaign by
scientists who use the laboratory and has been sharply
critical of the NSF for choosing Florida State, which will be
building a laboratory from scratch. However, the state of
Florida has committed $58 million to building the center and
NSF officials questioned the commitment of MIT to the project
in picking Florida.
   Friday, the NSF board of directors reaffirmed its earlier
decision saying it will "best maintain the long-term health
and vitality," of magnet research.

   Post Wins Reprieve Pending Union Vote

   But New York Tabloid
   Represents a Dying Breed

   NEW YORK -- The New York Post just may live to see
tomorrow, but the newspaper has come to represent a dying
breed.
   Post owner Peter Kalikow gave the paper a reprieve late
Friday, allowing the Newspaper Guild to vote on a
salary-slashing proposal that calls for a four-day work week
and 20% cut in pay. The Guild, which represents reporters,
editors, and advertising staff, is expected to approve the
proposal, under pressure, if only to save the jobs of other
union members.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kalikow, who has lost $80 million on the Post in two
and a half years, vows to close the paper immediately if the
proposal is not ratified tonight at a 6 p.m. meeting.
   The 189-year-old Post has lived by the sword and it could
die by the sword. Its trademark brand of journalism is rarely
seen anymore in American newspapers: a rough-and-tumble,
street-wise style, that mirrors both the passions and
prejudices of a polyglot New York readership. Headline
classics such as "Headless Body In Topless Bar," "Shark Eats
Man Alive," and "Best Sex I Ever Had" have played well in New
York.
   New Yorkers may yet see more of these hard-to-forget
headlines. But industry consultants, analysts, and even other
tabloid publishers, say the Post's incendiary, blood-and-guts
brand of tabloid newspaper has quickly become an anachronism.
   Even in the hands of its current editor, the
tough-talking, glib Jerry Nachman, a Brooklyn native who
virtually personifies a city tabloid editor, the Post's
circulation has sunk to desperate lows. Circulation once
soared under then-owner Rupert Murdoch in the 1980s.
Bolstered by readers sweepstakes and tantalizing crime
stories, Post circulation reached 962,000 in 1983; for the
six months ended March 31, Post circulation has dropped 6%
from a year earlier to 504,000. Circulation at New York's
"upscale market" papers, New York Newsday and the New York
Times, both moved up in the same period.
   Considered a mass-market crowd pleaser, tabloid-style
journalism has rarely been a winner in the last two decades.
Mr. Murdoch tried it in Chicago with the Sun-Times, gaining
readers but losing advertisers. The Toronto Sun Publishing
Corp. bought and transformed the Houston Post into a racy tab
in the early 1980s, after which the Post lost valuable market
share to the cross-town rival Houston Chronicle. In both
cities, new owners were faced with toning down the racy
style, usually to regain lost advertisers.
   In St. Louis, Ingersoll Publications Co. created a new
tabloid in the fall of 1989. Less sensational than most,
Ingersoll's St. Louis Sun played up crime, hired combative
columnists, and kept a conservative political stance, all a
counterpoint to Pulitzer Publishing Co.'s St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, the entrenched broadsheet. The Sun set after
only seven months due to high delivery cost, lackluster
street sales, and lack of consistent advertising from St.
Louis' most prestigious advertisers.
   "Demographic shifts are against papers like the Post,"
said James Dolan, a former Sun-Times executive and now a
media investment banker with Jordan Group. "The people most
likely to read a newspaper today are least likely to be
interested in what tabloids have to offer. The traditional
tabloid reader gets what he wants from TV."
   Even if the Post were winning over legions of new readers,
it would present a dilemma, according to John Morton,
newspaper industry analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan. While
Mr. Murdoch boosted circulation with games like Wingo, the
Post's share of the New York advertising market remains low.
"If you are losing money on every copy sold, the more you
sell the more you lose because of increased paper and
distribution costs," said Mr. Morton.
   Mr. Kalikow hired magazine editor Jane Amsterdam in 1988
to raise the paper's "journalistic standards and practices."
She played down the sensational sex stories and played up
investigative pieces. For a brief time, uptown department
stores took ads in the Post. But after run-ins with Mr.
Kalikow over editorial direction, Ms. Amsterdam left a year
later, succeeded by Mr. Nachman.
   "The problem is the ad market has targeted a whole other
group of reader," said Ms. Amsterdam.
   Tabloids are by no means dead, but they are being updated
for baby boomers.
   Times Mirror Co.'s New York Newsday straddles the line
between gritty street news and full coverage of the arts and
magazine-length feature stories. In Pawtucket, R.I., Robert
Jelenic, chief executive of Journal Register Co., which
includes the U.S. papers once belonging to Ralph Ingersoll,
plans a tabloid-style remake of the Evening Times, but with a
difference.
   "You can't get by today just on pretty girls on page 3 and
crime stories," said Mr. Jelenic. "You must have opinionated
columnists, good reporters, and you gotta break stories."
   Under Mr. Nachman, the Post has done its share of that,
breaking some of the biggest stories of the year in New York
City. In an interview Saturday, however, Mr. Nachman said "it
won't be easy" publishing the Post with reporters and editors
on four-day work weeks.
   Mr. Nachman vows not to be the last editor of the New York
Post. "The Post is like the Vietcong," he said. "You shoot
them . . . but they get back up and spray you with machine
gun fire . . . . the Post has a history of overcoming all
sorts of baroque obstacles."

   BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- In what amounts to a major triumph
for a Texas hot dog vendor and her elderly, handicapped work
force, a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. unit that had come under fire
for ordering the vendor off its properties said it has
reversed its position and will allow the vendor to stay.
   After Wal-Mart's Sam's Wholesale Clubs unit ordered
Scarlett Rabalais's Hot Diggity Dogs company to remove its
stands from in front of 21 Sam's stores in Texas, the local
press covered the eviction's implications for Ms. Rabalais's
largely elderly and handicapped work force. Eager to stop the
bad publicity, Sam's officials invited Ms. Rabalais to
Bentonville last week to discuss the problem.

   LONDON -- The Soviet Union is importing gasoline for the
first time in at least eight years, European oil-industry
sources said. The move coincides with other efforts by Moscow
to import goods in short supply, including billions of
cigarettes from the U.S.
   One oil-industry official said that it was difficult to
tell how much gasoline the Soviet Union was acquiring, but
that he had heard estimates it bought as much as 500,000 tons
so far this month from suppliers throughout Western Europe.
</LP>

   The industry sources said the purchases might result from
problems in the Soviet refining industry, or from cutbacks in
imported crude oil. One official said Soviet imports of
Libyan oil may have fallen sharply lately, depriving Soviet
refineries of a key feedstock. It wasn't clear if Moscow
would continue buying gasoline.

   LOS ANGELES -- Jonathan D. Krane, 38, resigned as chairman
and chief executive officer of Management Company
Entertainment Group Inc. under pressure from board members
and creditors.
   Mr. Krane, who founded the independent movie production
company three years ago, was the subject of a front-page
article in this newspaper last Thursday. MCEG is in default
of more than $100 million in debt and its largest creditors
include the GE Capital unit of General Electric Co. and
Virgin Group Ltd., a U.K. company headed by Richard Bramson.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy court judge granted MCEG a 10-day
extension Friday to respond to a creditor petition seeking to
force the company's movie unit into involuntary liquidation.
MCEG is continuing to negotiate a proposed reorganization
plan with creditors and potential investors that it hopes
will save it from the jaws of bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   Under Mr. Krane's resignation agreement, people close to
the situation said Mr. Krane will receive one year's salary,
or $504,000, and a $100,000 producer fee for the completion
of "Look Who's Talking Too," the sequel. Mr. Krane has been
producing that movie for Tri-Star Pictures Inc., a unit of
Sony Corp. MCEG also absolved Mr. Krane of a $200,000 debt to
the company. Mr. Krane couldn't be reached for comment.
   MCEG said Raymond H. Godfrey Jr., president and chief
operating officer, will temporarily assume the additional
post of chief executive officer. Mr. Godfrey said that MCEG
intends to enter into a "management consulting agreement"
with an investor group headed by Norman Levy, a former vice
chairman of News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.
   Under one scenario, the investor group, which includes
Michael Tarr, a film maker, and Donald Tractenberg, a former
vice president of finance at Fox, would bring $10 million
into the company to complete six unfinished movies. Mr.
Godfrey said the proposed restructuring plan would include
additional infusions of capital from GE Capital and Virgin
Group. He also said GE Capital will make a loan of $3 million
today to provide working capital.
   MCEG was scheduled to meet with its bondholders today at
PaineWebber Inc. in New York to discuss the restructuring.
   When MCEG went public in August of 1987, Mr. Krane
received $500,000 in cash, 2.5 million common shares and
preferred shares redeemable for $1 million in 1992in exchange
for his talent management company. However, under his
resignation agreement, sources said MCEG has an option to buy
all of Mr. Krane's preferred shares for $100 instead of $1
million.
   MCEG common shares, which traded as high as $4.375 last
year, closed Friday at 40.625 cents in over-the-counter
trading.

   Data General Corp. said it settled two shareholder
lawsuits, agreeing to pay the plaintiff classes a total of $6
million.
   The five-year-old suits, Malanka vs. Data General and
Lewis vs. de Castro, had charged that Data General executives
including Edson de Castro, then president and chief executive
officer, had sold stock before announcing negative news about
the company.

   Neither Data General, a minicomputer maker in Westboro,
Mass., nor the executives admitted any liability. Data
General said insurance will cover a portion of the
settlement.
   Data General also said it was sued in U.S. District Court
in Boston in another shareholder suit charging the company
made misleading statements about its business earlier this
year. The company said it believes the suit is without merit.

   Japan's Auto Workers Seek
   Longer New-Model Cycles

   TOKYO -- Japan's auto workers, complaining about too much
overtime, want the industry to stretch out its four-year
cycle for introducing new car models.
   Japanese auto makers say the unions haven't approached
them directly on the issue, but some are nervous anyway. "One
of the advantages of Japanese auto makers in the global
competition is the speed of development," said a Honda Motor
Co. official, adding that Japan's "competitive edge might be
dulled" if the cycle is lengthened. In Europe and the U.S.,
the cycle runs six to eight years, industry officials say.

   Teruhito Tokumoto, president of the Confederation of Japan
Automobile Workers' Union, Japan's biggest auto industry
labor group, recently proposed a review of the four-year
cycle, citing a new government policy to reduce average
annual working hours to below 1,800 by 1992. Workers in the
auto industry averaged 2,275 hours last year, the Labor
Ministry says, more than any other manufacturing sector.
   An analyst at Yamaichi Securities Co. says the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry might have approached Toyota
Motor Corp., the leading Japanese auto maker, about
shortening hours. Some industry officials support the idea,
because fierce competition may already have shortened the
car-model cycle to less than four years.

   Economy Hurt by Oil Prices, Data Show

   Producer Prices in August
   Soared 1.3%; Retail Sales
   Industrial Output Fell

   WASHINGTON -- Rising oil prices are clearly taking a toll
on the economy, boosting inflation and crimping consumer
spending, new government figures indicate.
   Releasing its first data on the nation's inflation,
spending and production since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, the government said producer prices soared 1.3% in
August, while retail sales dropped 0.6% and industrial output
slipped 0.2%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The figures bore out the fears of many analysts that the
surge in oil prices brought on by the Persian Gulf turmoil
would threaten the already weak economy by pinching
Americans' purchasing power and piling a new burden on
businesses.
   An increasing number of economists now believe a recession
in the near future is inescapable. "Look at what happened in
August: employment declined, consumer spending declined,
industrial production declined," said Donald Ratajczak,
director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State
University. "At some point when it looks and smells and acts
like a duck, then what is it?"
   The jump in the Labor Department's producer price index,
which measures the prices factories, farmers and other
producers receive for goods, was fueled mostly by energy
prices, which catapulted 9.6% during the month. But even
excluding energy the index rose a substantial 0.5%, amounting
to a 6% annual rate.
   Gasoline prices leaped 16.9% while prices of home heating
oil soared 38.8%. Crude petroleum prices skyrocketed 62.5%,
the largest monthly increase ever recorded. That pushed up an
index measuring prices of unfinished goods a startling 9.3%
in August, the steepest rise since August 1973, when the
government ended a price freeze.
   Many economists believe the problems of inflation stemming
from the oil crisis are only beginning.
   "We know the inflation effect isn't over," said James
Annable, chief economist at First National Bank of Chicago,
predicting that it will take three or four months before the
jump in crude oil prices works its way through to the gas
pump, heating bill and other consumer energy costs. "So the
rest of the year is going to be dominated by the oil price
increase and feeding through to other products."
   Already, Mr. Ratajczak noted, makers of petroleum-based
chemical products have announced increases in the prices of
their products. Nevertheless, he and other analysts predicted
that many businesses will have a hard time passing higher
energy costs on to their customers, given the weak economy.
   Airlines are already finding that out. Many postponed
plans to raise fares to cover huge rises in their fuel bills
in the face of softening consumer demand.
   The drop in retail sales came despite a huge 6.4% rise in
the amount of money taken in by gasoline stations during the
month. While higher gasoline prices pushed up sales totals at
filling stations, business for most other types of merchants
declined. Sales of car dealers plummeted 4.3%.
Department-store sales slipped 0.2%. Hardware and
building-supply stores dropped 2.4%. Restaurant sales fell
0.7%. Sales of furniture stores increased, however, climbing
0.7%.
   "American consumers cut back sharply in August as their
confidence about economic conditions plunged," said Donald
Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New
York.
   The drop in industrial production last month reflected
small declines in the output of a wide array of industries,
including cars, computers and clothing. As a result, the
operating rates of factories, mines and utilities fell to
83.1% of capacity in August from 83.5% in July.
   The string of reports highlight the difficulty confronting
the Federal Reserve. The central bank is under pressure to
lower interest rates to jump-start the ailing economy. But
officials are wary of allowing rates to fall while inflation
remains a problem.
   Few analysts expect inflation to spiral out of control as
it did following the oil shock of the late 1970s. Global
competition is likely to force companies to keep a firm grip
on prices and wages, Mr. Annable predicted.
   Still, the oil price jolt "probably but not certainly will
push the economy over the edge into a mild recession," said
Charles Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution
in Washington who was chairman of the White House Council of
Economic Advisers during the Carter administration.
   Figures in all three reports were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.

   RTC, Ignoring Federal Judge's Ruling,
   Will Declare Kansas Thrift Insolvent

   The Resolution Trust Corp., ignoring a federal judge's
findings, said it will recognize new losses at Franklin
Savings Association and declare the Kansas thrift insolvent
with negative capital of $8 million.
   The new writedowns are contained in a financial statement
to be filed today with the Office of Thrift Supervision in
Topeka, Kan., and may spark another round of litigation
between Franklin's owners and thrift regulators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A new court fight, coming on the heels of a judge's ruling
that Franklin properly posted positive capital, could also
involve the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, whose audit
forms the basis of the financial statement to be filed by the
RTC.
   Franklin officials have been questioning the impartiality
of Price Waterhouse since obtaining internal OTS memoranda
about the retention of the accounting firm in the course of
its lawsuit challenging the OTS's seizure of the thrift. "PW
{Price Waterhouse} is best qualified to do the audit and
shares our views on the hedge accounting issue," an OTS
official said in one memorandum urging the RTC to retain the
accounting firm. "It is in everyone's best interest to have
PW do the audit."
   Franklin was placed in conservatorship by the OTS and its
management duties turned over to the RTC last Feb. 16 after
the thrift refused to immediately recognize about $119
million in losses on futures contracts. Those contracts were
held as a hedge against losses in the $10.26 billion of
mortgage-backed securities that dominated Franklin's
portfolio of assets.
   Price Waterhouse couldn't be reached for comment after the
RTC released its preliminary findings late Friday. An RTC
spokesman said the agency conducted a review of Franklin's
financial status independent of the accounting firm.
   In its lawsuit against the OTS, Franklin's management
successfully contended that the agency had applied different
accounting methods to Franklin's unorthodox business
practices than the ones that had previously been approved by
thrift regulators. Franklin's methods, endorsed by its
accounting firm, Deloitte Touche, allowed the thrift to delay
recognition of certain losses on its hedging positions, among
other things.
   Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels of
Topeka ruled that the OTS had been "arbitrary and capricious"
in its decision to place Franklin in conservatorship.
   Judge Saffels's order was temporarily stayed by an appeals
court in Denver the next day, putting the RTC back in control
of Franklin. The OTS has appealed Judge Saffels's decision.
   The RTC said the financial statement to be filed today
reflects the RTC's assessment of Franklin's condition for the
fiscal year ending June 30. While not nearly as devastating
as the OTS's declaration that Franklin's capital stood at
negative $44.3 million in mid-February, the RTC statement is
nonetheless disputed by Franklin's chairman, Ernest M.
Fleischer.
   "For RTC to publish a statement that reflects a negative
{capital} is either a misapplication of accounting
methodology or gross mismanagement by the RTC or a
combination of both," Mr. Fleischer said.
   The RTC found, among other things, that Franklin should
have recorded an additional $196 million in hedging losses
for the year ended June 30, 1989.
   The RTC also said Franklin should recognize $50 million in
losses from six bond issues for which the RTC stopped paying
interest on June 8. Some bondholders have challenged the RTC
in court, and the agency said a successful challenge will
result in additional losses of $142 million.

   Purchase of Rail Operations

   CSX Corp. moved closer to acquiring the rail operations of
RF&amp;P Corp.
   CSX, a Richmond, Va., freight transportation company,
agreed to a proposal under which it would acquire RF&amp;P's rail
operations in exchange for CSX's 62.7% voting position in
RF&amp;P.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Virginia Retirement System, which initiated the
transaction, would acquire CSX's remaining shares in RF&amp;P for
$35 each. Virginia Retirement System, the second-largest
independent RF&amp;P holder, owns about 28% of the combined
voting and nonvoting shares.
   CSX said the proposed transaction would result in RF&amp;P's
retaining all of its real estate while transferring to CSX
only its railroad operations in a tax-free transaction. RF&amp;P
owns the 113-mile Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac
Railroad, which links the northern and southern parts of
CSX's rail system.
   The transaction is subject to approval by RF&amp;P's board,
the board of CSX, and Virginia Retirement System trustees.
   This past spring, CSX offered to pay one share of its
common or $34.50 cash -- a total of $385 million -- for each
RF&amp;P share it didn't already own. But CSX withdrew the offer
amid opposition from RF&amp;P holders who deemed the bid too low.

   CSX Corp. said the Virginia Retirement System proposed an
exchange of a portion of CSX's RF&amp;P Corp. dividend
obligations for the stock of an RF&amp;P subsidiary that holds
the RF&amp;P railroad. The Virginia Retirement System also
proposed that it purchase CSX's remaining RF&amp;P dividend
obligations and its RF&amp;P voting shares at $35 a share. In
yesterday's edition, terms of the transaction were misstated.

   CLEVELAND -- Plaintiffs won a $13.5 million libel suit in
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court against the Cleveland
Plain Dealer.
   Former promoters of a car race called the Budweiser
Cleveland Grand Prix alleged that they were defamed by
stories in the newspaper in 1984, and followed up in 1985 and
1986. The plaintiffs sought $16 million in damages, including
$10 million in punitive damages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The $13.5 million verdict included $4.5 million in
compensatory damages and $9 million in punitive damages.
   A secretary for the paper's top news officials said the
Plain Dealer hadn't yet prepared a statement about the
verdict. Lawyers who represented the newspaper couldn't be
reached for comment.
   The articles said that Charles K. Newcomb and James H.
Foster had paid themselves nearly $1 million from race
proceeds for management fees, salaries, commissions, legal
and accounting fees, and equipment rental fees in violation
of the lease they had with the city, according to a story in
Thursday's Plain Dealer.
   Messrs. Newcomb and Foster and their company, C. K.
Newcomb &amp; Associates of Cleveland, sold the race to
businessman and former race car driver Roger Penske in 1985.
At that point the Plain Dealer became a co-sponsor.
   Plain Dealer lawyers had argued the articles were correct,
the newspaper reported. The Plain Dealer is part of the
Newhouse chain, which is owned by Advance Publications Inc.

   THE U.S. IS EXPORTING more gasoline, even as debate
continues over the adequacy of the nation's future petroleum
supplies. Higher foreign gas prices are spurring the trend,
which could result in continued high costs for U.S. motorists
and tight wholesale supplies in the coming months. Those
factors in turn could create new policy problems for the
federal government.

   Economy -- Tracking the Economy:
   Mideast Oil Crisis Is Expected to Hurt
   Price and Trade Data Due This Week

   NEW YORK -- The biggest blow from the oil crisis hits the
consumer price index this week but the turmoil will also
eventually interrupt recent progress on the trade deficit.
   The July trade data, due out tomorrow, won't be affected
by the Mideast oil crisis that began in August. Even so, the
July deficit is expected to widen because of higher oil
imports that month. The week's other major indicators include
July business inventories and August housing starts and
permits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'd hoped to see 1990 as the year that the trade deficit
improved. But that hope's gone. It's fizzled," said Richard
Trainer, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, New York.
Helped along by a weak dollar this year, the important
oil-related proportion of the trade deficit fell to about 9%
in June from about 15% in January, he said. But Mr. Trainer
expects the oil portion to breach 15% again by September or
October.
   The July trade deficit is expected to expand to $7.3
billion from June's $5.1 billion gap, according to MMS
International Inc., a unit of McGraw-Hill, New York. Samuel
Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc., Chicago, said
he plans to add $1 billion onto the August trade deficit and
$2 billion onto September's gap due to inflated oil prices.
August won't feel the full impact, economists said, partly
because of the interruption of supplies.
   Any help the trade deficit may get from a weak dollar will
be offset for some time by the sharp jump in the cost of
imported oil, said Mr. Kahan. He noted the U.S. imports
around eight million barrels of oil a day; the cost
difference between July's price and August's price was about
$8 a barrel.
   As for the dollar, Mr. Kahan calculates that every 10%
depreciation of the greenback translates into a 10% increase
in exports -- but only after a two-year flow-through period.
So, "in the near term, the oil crisis is going to cause only
a widening" of the trade deficit, he said.
   Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, New York, agrees that the oil crisis "is
pretty much a cut-and-dried negative" for the trade balance.
Still, he notes that "we've made a lot of progress in
non-petroleum components of the trade deficit, too. I don't
think people should forget that."
   Most consumers will probably focus on their pocketbooks
tomorrow when the much-awaited consumer price index discloses
the initial hit from higher energy prices. The consensus view
calls for an increase of 0.8%, double July's 0.4% increase.
Excluding food and energy components, the August CPI is
expected to rise 0.4%.
   More weak readings on the underlying economy are expected
in Wednesday's report on August housing starts. The combined
impact of the oil-induced shock to consumer confidence plus a
renewed upturn in mortgage rates should add up to the seventh
consecutive monthly drop in starts, noted Stephen Roach,
economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., New York. July business
inventories, due out today, are expected to increase 0.5% in
what some economists worry is yet another reflection of poor
sales levels.

   YES WE WILL; NO WE WON'T: The Conference Board's chief
economist trimmed its economic growth outlook for the rest of
the year, but said the economy will escape recession despite
the oil crisis. But many of the nation's corporate
controllers disagree. Half the nation's corporate controllers
expect a recession this year and 75% of them believe it will
last through 1991, according to a survey by the National
Association of Accountants. The controllers said higher
short- and long-term interest rates remain their top concern.

   WASHINGTON -- Congress should enact legislation to assure
that the U.S. government securities market has adequate
investor protection and that bond-price data are publicly
available on a timely basis to those willing to pay for it,
the General Accounting Office said.
   The congressional watchdog agency urged Congress to give
the Treasury authority to adopt rules to upgrade the sales
practices of government securities brokers and dealers and to
require interdealer brokers in the market to make transaction
information available to market participants on a real-time
basis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Public Securities Association, a bond trade group
whose members include all 41 primary dealers in U.S.
government securities, said it is working on an initiative
that "will obviate the need for Congress to mandate price
dissemination through federal regulation." The joint venture,
which involves primary dealers and most interdealer brokers,
"will begin disseminating prices in early 1991 on a 24-hour
global real-time basis," the association said.
   The GAO recommended that Congress extend the Treasury's
rule-making authority over the government market. This
authority, granted in the 1986 Government Securities Act, is
scheduled to expire next year. GAO also urged Congress to
extend Securities Investor Protection Corp. coverage to
customer accounts in specialized government securities
dealers.
   Acting Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Basham, in a
letter attached to the GAO report, supported the
recommendation that Congress order public access to broker
screen information. He didn't address the sales-practices
question.

   NEW YORK -- It was not in the stars.
   Hearst Corp. and Burda Publications of West Germany said
they would fold Jupiter, the "upscale" astrology magazine
they jointly published.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jupiter first appeared on newsstands last December but
sales after two issues were disappointing. As is typical of
Hearst, most new magazines are launched first on newsstands
to see if circulation gradually builds before increasing
publishing frequency.
   Jack Heistand, vice president of marketing at Hearst
Magazines, said Hearst and Burda had spent a "modest amount"
on the first two issues, but that Jupiter's "newsstand sales
didn't pass the hurdle rate we set for it." He said the
astrology magazine would probably not be attempted again.
   Burda currently publishes a monthly version of Jupiter in
West Germany. Astrology magazines and booklets are among the
best-selling publications at supermarket checkout counters.
   Hearst continues to test two other magazines on
newsstands, American Home and Countryside. However, another
new magazine, Auto Times Weekly, has been suspended for one
year, because of what Mr. Heistand called "the current soft
auto market." Auto Times Weekly was a mass-market, weekly
tabloid published jointly by Hearst and Axel Springer Verlag.

Democrats will get a "surcharge" on tax rates for the rich,"
but also get to say how much revenue this will "raise"
(lose).
   To add insult to injury, Republicans will tell us they

   Trade Outlook: IMF Official Stresses
   Urgency in Uruguay Round Talks

   WASHINGTON -- A slowdown in world economic growth rates
and the situation created by the crisis in the Middle East
"make it all the more urgent" that the Uruguay Round of world
trade negotiations be successfully completed by late this
year, according to Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund.
   With finance ministers, central bankers and other
officials of industrial nations and developing countries
scheduled to gather in Washington late this week for the
joint annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, top
officials of both international agencies will be stressing
this issue, along with the need for other actions to offset
higher world oil prices and the "second-round" economic
impact of the Middle East crisis on developing nations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If the concept of international community has any
meaning," says Mr. Camdessus, then the industrial countries
must intensify their efforts to achieve higher economic
growth rates than can be achieved without triggering an
acceleration of inflation.
   "In the trade area," the IMF official adds, "it is
essential that they open their markets further and strive for
more liberal trade and payments systems. Indeed, the recent
slowdown in world growth, together with the situation created
by the situation in the Middle East, make it all the more
urgent that the Uruguay Round negotiations be concluded
successfully."
   Mr. Camdessus made his comments at a meeting of a United
Nations group in Paris last week, where he also said the
current world economic outlook points to a further slowing of
growth rates and higher inflation rates during 1990 and 1991
in industrial countries and a worsening of the export
prospects for developing countries as a result of weaker
demand for their products in world markets.
   The IMF, in its annual report approved by its executive
directors who represent the 151 member nations of the
international agency, also said "stronger efforts are
urgently needed to counter protectionism and to foster a more
open trading system with transparent, predictable and
nondiscriminatory rules in order to sustain" an expansion of
world trade and provide markets for exports from the indebted
developing countries.
   ---
   EXPORT GROWTH: Both the IMF and the World Bank, in their
annual reports, noted that world trade, measured either by
volume or value terms, expanded by about 7.5% last year, down
from an unusually high 9% increase a year earlier. But
exports of developing countries as a group failed to achieve
such big gains.
   The World Bank said 1989 was the first year since 1985
that exports of developing countries as a group didn't expand
at a higher rate than the world average, and it noted that
shipments of manufactured goods by the major Asian exporters
"fell sharply" last year.
   Market shares for exports have been shifting, the IMF
said.
   "The volume of goods exported by the U.S. increased by
10.5% in 1989, the best performance among the major
industrial countries," the IMF said, adding that this raised
the U.S. share of total world trade, excluding oil, to 13.5%
from a low of 11.5% in 1987.
   Japan's share of world exports in 1989, the IMF said,
declined to 10% from a peak of 11.5% in 1986, while West
Germany, displaced by the U.S. as the top world exporter of
manufactured goods, held "steady" with about a 12.5% share of
nonoil exports in 1989.
   ---
   MAJOR WORLD EXPORTERS: According to the World Bank, 23
countries rank among the leading exporters; they accounted
for about 78.2% of all exports in 1989.
   The World Bank ranking, in order, of the major exporters
in terms of their market-shares for all types of exports last
year, is: U.S., West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy,
Canada, Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Belgium-Luxembourg,
South Korea, China, Sweden, Switzerland, Singapore, Spain,
Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Austria, East Germany, Saudi
Arabia, and Denmark.
   The World Bank didn't include data on exports of Taiwan or
Hong Kong, both of which probably would have made the list if
their shares of world exports had been computed.
   ---
   CZECHOSLOVAKIAN TRADE: Legislation to reduce U.S. tariff
rates for imports from Czechoslovakia was expected to glide
through the U.S. Congress without much difficulty before the
final 1990 Capitol Hill adjournment next month.
   But the White House plan to extend similar
most-favored-nation treatment to imports from the Soviet
Union apparently won't be considered by the U.S. Congress
until next year.
   In Moscow, U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said
last week that Soviet officials told him that it would take
four to eight weeks for the Supreme Soviet legislative body
to complete action on a proposed law to liberalize Soviet
emigration policies.
   ---
   AIRBUS SUBSIDIES: U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills is
leading a high-ranking delegation of U.S. corporation
executives, bankers, labor leaders and farm group officials
to Geneva early this week to size up the prospects for
completing the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations
later this year.
   Mrs. Hills also plans to visit Brussels and Rome before
returning to Washington at the end of the week.
   During the Brussels visit, Mrs. Hills probably will also
hold talks with European Community Commissioner Frans
Andriessen on a proposed agreement that would limit
development subsidies provided to Airbus Industrie, the
western European commercial aircraft-building consortium, by
the governments of West Germany, Britain, France and Spain.
   U.S. and EC sources say prospects are improving that such
an agreement can be reached by the end of this month.
   ---
   PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN THIRD WORLD: The International
Finance Corp., a World Bank affiliate that started off on a
small scale way back in 1956 to help finance manufacturing
plants and other private business ventures in developing
nations has become a relatively "big-money" operation.
   In the year ending last June 30, for example, the IFC made
about $2.2 billion in such investments and it persuaded
international commercial banks to provide about $622 million
of that amount through participations in the IFC-approved
loans and equity investments.
   Now the IFC is looking for its 135-member countries to
agree late this year on a $1 billion IFC capital increase
that would allow the World Bank affiliate to step up its own
borrowings in private capital markets and keep expanding its
operations over the next five years.
   ---
   COUNTERTRADE: A former senior U.S. Export-Import Bank
official who arranges private countertrade deals between U.S.
companies and others abroad, is trying to persuade U.S.
trade-policy officials to be more supportive of such
transactions.
   Matt Schaffer, of D.M. Schaffer Corp., based in
Washington, says Japanese trading companies have long used
countertrade arrangements that customarily involve payment in
goods, rather than money, for exports.
   Generally, countertrade opponents argue that trading
exports for other goods, ranging from bathtubs to canned
hams, is a burdensome and inefficient way of engaging in
international trade.
   Countertrade used to be a big thing in eastern European
countries, almost as a matter of necessity, but economic
reforms now under way in that part of the world are steering
away from countertrade transactions and U.S. trade-policy
officials have applauded this trend.

   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov is warning that the
Soviet Union will have to cut imports of medicine and
consumer goods sharply; there's no money to pay for them.
Tent cities are popping up in downtown Moscow, part protests,
part Gorbovilles. Rude inspectors at Soviet airports used to
meticulously examine currency exchange forms; now they often
don't bother -- Marlboros, not rubles, have become the
currency of choice. Black markets are taking over goods
distribution.
   In short, the downward spiral of the Soviet Union is
visible everywhere. One prominent Russian academic publicly
calls Gorbachev "our Hitler." That vicious description, while
unfair, reflects broad and deep-seated public bitterness.
Separate articles last week in the Moscow News and literary
Gazette discussed the possibility of a military coup against
the government to restore order.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gorbachev has followed through on an agreement he made
recently with Boris Yeltsin, throwing his weight behind the
free market reform plan of Stanislav Shatalin. Mr. Shatalin's
plan is a vast improvement on the timid plan written by Mr.
Ryzhkov, which Mr. Gorbachev had heretofore supported. But we
suspect that Mr. Gorbachev did not shift because be's been
spending his evenings reading Adam Smith. In his desperation,
he is willing to back any plan that might help him hold the
crumbling Soviet empire together.
   More important than what the Shatalin plan has to say
about privatization and price reform is the provision that
allows each republic to set its own economic policy. This is
what Mr. Yeltsin and the other republic heads wanted. The
Russian parliament endorsed the Shatalin plan 213-1. As long
as Mr. Gorbachev gives them what they want, they won't have
to set about destroying him. He and the central government
survive another day.
   Mr. Ryzhkov argued that giving the republics independent
economic policy would lead to disintegration. He's probably
right, Mr. Gorbachev can no longer afford to think of the
long term. Even the Shatalin plan has a time schedule of 500
days, an eternity for a system facing imminent collapse.
   Mr. Gorbahev may now be convinced that reform from the
center is impossible. After five years of power, he has shown
himself incapable of producing the necessary transformation.
There is an ineluctable momentum in the Soviet Union toward
decentralized authority. After 70 years of central control,
Soviet peoples want the reverse. This is not only happening
politically but in enterprises and institutions. It brings
disorder and redundancy, as Russians freely admit, but in a
sea of chaos people want control over their own little
islands.
   There simply is no longer an apparatus with the authority
to privatize property on an all-Union level. There is
certainly no authority sophisticated enough to carry out a
privatization scheme that meets various political goals, such
as social equity and fair distribution of property. The
republic governments, where many of the politicians of the
future are already in place, at least have a chance. But
privatization may eventually become simply an ad hoc process
carried out at local levels.
   The shift to the Shatalin plan should cause the West to
rethink its government-to-government transfer programs. If
republics are to become the major economic actors, Westerners
will have to make contacts at that level, and not with the
increasingly redundant central officials. Many in the West
have feared that contact with local officials would be seen
in Moscow as an effort to undermine Mr. Gorbachev. But now
that Mr. Gorbachev himself has signed on to the idea of local
economic independence, he has no grounds to object.
   There have been many Soviet five-year plans since the
Bolshevik revolution. The Shatalin plan may well be the final
economic plan with the word Soviet Union attached. Maybe this
will be the first one to work, or maybe the whirlpool toward
anarchy will swallow it up.

   Bush's Desire to Peacefully Restrain
   Iraq's Weapons Program May Be Elusive

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration says stringent
international controls could peacefully curb Iraq's
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons programs, even if
Saddam Hussein remains in power.
   But judging from recent experience, that may be a pipe
dream.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Baghdad already has the facilities to continue producing
massive quantities of its own biological and chemical
weapons, and it has sophisticated missiles to deliver them,
experts say. More worrisome, the nuclear nonproliferation
treaty can't significantly restrict Saddam Hussein's quest
for nuclear weapons: under the treaty, which Iraq has signed,
he can continue Iraq's nuclear research effort.
   These stark realities fuel the debate over whether the
U.S. can achieve its goals in the Persian Gulf unless it
topples Saddam Hussein.
   So far, the Bush administration hasn't reached its own
conclusion. In his address to a joint session of Congress
last week, the president said only that one long-term U.S.
objective in the Persian Gulf would be "to curb the
proliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic missiles
and, above all, nuclear technologies."
   Lately, the administration seems to be hoping it can
achieve its goal short of eliminating the Iraqi dictator. But
many experts say containment won't work. They note that with
international help, Iraq has built a nearly self-sufficient
defense industry. West German companies built its
chemical-weapons facilities. French companies helped it
construct an electronics plant that makes computer chips and
circuit boards used in air-defense equipment. A Chilean
company designed an Iraqi factory that makes cluster bombs.
   Similarly, Iraq has sophisticated missile technology. In
December, it surprised U.S. and other intelligence services
by launching a rocket capable of putting a satellite in
orbit. And according to a report last week, Iraq successfully
tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile loaded with
chemical weapons.
   "All of our experience over the last decade suggests you
simply cannot effectively control the ability of a country to
obtain technology if they really want to get it," says W.
Seth Carus, research fellow at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, a private group.
   The U.S. itself lacks the means to block the flow of
militarily sensitive technology to regional powers. Under
current rules, the Pentagon only has the authority to monitor
certain potentially troublesome exports to communist nations.
But now that the communist bloc has dissolved, it is nations
such as Iraq that pose the greatest threat. Last week, the
Senate passed a measure giving the Pentagon more authority,
but the measure must be reconciled with a House bill.
   Concerning nuclear facilities, Leonard Spector, an expert
on nuclear proliferation issues at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, says the current treaty isn't enough to
safeguard the world against a maverick like Saddam Hussein.
   Non-nuclear countries that have signed the treaty, such as
Iraq, pledge not to develop nuclear weapons. But the treaty
allows them to do nuclear work that ostensibly is for
peaceful purposes. So, Saddam Hussein could continue his
nuclear research program without violating the treaty until
he is just weeks from being able to produce a bomb.
   Mr. Spector says the U.S. prefers additional agreements,
such as one it has with South Korea, that say certain kinds
of nuclear facilities -- such as enrichment plants or large
research reactors -- won't be built even though permitted by
the treaty.
   Last week, Secretary of State James Baker seemed to be
suggesting similar arrangements could be applied in the
Middle East. He told North Atlantic Treaty Organization
allies that the major powers and Mideast nations "need to
consider intrusive, internationally sanctioned measures and
procedures to diminish the threat of Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction."
   But how could "intrusive" measures be peacefully used on
Saddam Hussein? "It seems to me that if Saddam Hussein
withdraws from Kuwait, we're going to be stuck with a
situation where we would wish for more than the treaty, but
won't be able to get it," says Mr. Spector.
   As a result, some experts are concluding reluctantly that
there is only one way to deal effectively with Iraq's nuclear
capabilities. "Given their record on important treaties, we
cannot be sure that their word means they will honor their
obligations," says congressional aide Peter Galbraith, a

   TOKYO -- U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators continued
talks over the weekend in an effort to settle a dispute over
whether Allied-Signal Inc. is being denied fair access to the
Japanese market for its amorphous metals material.
   Although the deadline for settling the issue without
formal action by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
was technically Saturday, Allied won't be able to activate
its petition until Monday morning in Washington.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. official familiar with the talks indicated that,
while there hadn't been any fundamental breakthroughs as of
Sunday morning, there had been enough movement to continue
talking. He rated the chances for an eleventh-hour agreement
as "an even call."
   Allied, based in Morristown, N.J., filed a complaint last
March charging that Japanese electric utilities were delaying
commercial introduction of amorphous-metal electrical
transformers until Japanese steelmakers could find a way
around Allied's Japanese patent protection for the material.
At the request of U.S. trade officials, Allied later
suspended the complaint until Sept. 15 to allow time for the
issue to be settled without formal action.
   Under U.S. trade law, reactivation of the petition could
lead to retaliatory action against Japanese imports to the
U.S. next year.

   Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, a West German engineering and
machinery concern, posted first-half net income of five
million marks ($3.2 million), reversing a year-earlier loss
of 30 million marks.
   World-wide group sales advanced 10% to 1.88 billion marks
from 1.7 billion marks. Year-earlier figures were adjusted
downward to account for shedding operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Amid a far-reaching corporate restructuring, Kloeckner's
return to profitability was apparently aided by the disposal
of some unprofitable businesses in the past 12 months. On the
basis of continuing operations, the company said its five
million-mark profit compared with a year-earlier loss of 18
million marks.
   Kloeckner's order backlog at June 30 increased 22% to 2.08
billion marks.
   For 1990, Kloeckner said it expects "better operating
earnings" than the year-earlier 44 million marks, before
taxes and extraordinary charges, and expressed confidence
about posting net. In 1989, after charges of 194.1 million
marks, the company had a net loss of 170 million marks on
4.06 billion marks of world-wide sales.

   U.S. Pays Record Export Subsidies to Bolster
   Grain Sales to Counter European Competition

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The government has begun paying record
export subsidies to boost U.S. grain sales overseas, but most
analysts say it still won't be enough to shore up sagging
wheat markets.
   The Agriculture Department is going to unprecedented
lengths to counter the competitive challenge of the European
Community at a time of bumper grain crops, swelling
stockpiles and shrinking import demand. For the first time,
so-called export bonuses under the government's Export
Enhancement Program topped $50 a ton last week as Agriculture
Department officials sought to match lavish export subsidies
being offered by the French and other European exporters --
and to protect U.S. market share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You're looking at record levels," said one official. "I
think we're well into new territory."
   The department, partly in response to political pressure
from the Wheat Belt to do whatever it can to prop up wheat
prices, subsidized the sale of more than 500,000 tons of
wheat last week. Export bonuses on a 100,000-ton sale of hard
red winter wheat to Tunisia averaged a whopping $49.23 a ton,
while bonuses on a 12,000-ton wheat sale to West African
nations averaged a record $54.01 a ton.
   Under the Export Enhancement Program, exporters sell U.S.
wheat and other commodities at the world-market price and
collect bonuses in the form of surplus, government-owned
commodities. The bonuses make up the difference between
higher U.S. prices and the world-market prices.
   But several commodity analysts said such bursts of small-
and medium-sized sales will give the depressed futures
markets only a short-term psychological boost. Some faulted
the Agriculture Department for not making aggressive use of
export bonuses sooner.
   "They were very slow in waking up to the fact that it's a
buyer's market," said Katharina Zimmer, a Merrill Lynch
analyst in New York. "They're now doing what they should have
done long ago."
   Until recently, added Anne Frick, a Prudential-Bache
Securities analyst in New York, the bonuses "haven't been
large enough to compete with the EC."
   The gloomy consensus is that it will take a big sale to
shore up the wheat market, and none appears to be imminent.
   "If we did make a relatively large sale -- one million or
two million tons -- that would trigger a rally of 20 cents a
bushel," said Ms. Zimmer. "The price would fall back some,
but it would put a floor under the market."
   This fall, the Soviet Union is expected to resume buying
grain in large quantities. The Soviets have expressed
interest in obtaining $2 billion in U.S. credit, and the Bush
administration has indicated a willingness to extend
export-credit guarantees. Technically, the Soviet Union is
eligible for credit, but the administration has taken the
political stance that Moscow must liberalize Soviet
immigration law to qualify for most-favored-nation status.
   Most analysts believe credit won't be forthcoming for at
least one month, and there isn't any guarantee the Soviets
will use it for wheat purchases. Ms. Zimmer said, "They're
already looking at a lovely wheat crop." Instead, they may be
more interested in buying corn and soybean meal as well as
certain processed foods that would help mollify disgruntled
consumers.
   Lately, the Soviets "haven't been buying anything except
ready-to-eat items that they need to avoid revolution or
anarchy," said John Schnittker, a Washington-based
agricultural consultant. Two such items: chicken legs and
cigarettes.
   The prospect of bumper crops throughout the Northern
Hemisphere and the loss of the Iraqi market due to the
Persian Gulf crisis have battered wheat prices. But
department officials take sharp issue with criticism that
they have "used the EEP program very meekly."
   "We have had {export} initiatives out there," said a
senior official. "It's more a factor of good crops and lower
buying." He said he expects the latest batch of subsidized
sales to be "very beneficial to the export picture at a time
when there hasn't been all that much export activity."
   Meanwhile, a farm-policy showdown is shaping up between
the Bush administration and lawmakers from grain-growing
states. Rep. Dan Glickman, chairman of a House Agriculture
subcommittee, intends to hold hearings, beginning today, on
the possibility of using export bonuses to boost the sale of
wheat flour and other processed foods, and on how much land
wheat farmers should take out of production in 1991.
   The Senate has adopted a bill requiring farmers to idle
15% of their wheat acreage. Mr. Glickman (D., Kan.) has
proposed a similar measure, but it would give farmers the
option of collecting payments for idling an additional 5%.
The administration has consistently opposed acreage
reductions of this size, arguing that they encourage farmers
overseas to plant more.
   Prudential-Bache's Ms. Frick, said that a 15% reduction,
if enacted, "would give the market a slight short-term boost;
it wouldn't fix the problem."
   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Precious Metals
                                                                                                       

   Gold prices firmed slightly Friday on heightened Persian
Gulf tensions; the nervousness is expected to continue this
week.
   Traders bought contracts after it was reported that Iraqi
soldiers had broken into a number of foreign embassies in
Kuwait City and that a U.S. naval vessel fired a warning shot
before boarding an Iraqi ship.
   December gold rose only $2.20 an ounce to $391; while
silver and platinum declined. The lack of significant
response to the Middle Eastern developments was due to
traders' ambivalence, one analyst said.
   "There have been a number of weekends when traders have
gone away expecting that fighting would break out in the
Persian Gulf and it hasn't," he said. "This has made for
Monday price declines."
   On the other hand, he noted, the situation is explosive
and any developments are likely to boost prices rather than
weaken them. That's why a moderate demand for gold futures
contracts developed, he said. A major factor hampering a
strong rally, he added, is the lack of demand for gold
bullion.
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   Headline-driven oil markets got a flurry of new headlines
over the weekend as war in the Persian Gulf seemed more
imminent than ever. The United Nations security council
unanimously condemned Iraq's raids against French, Canadian,
Dutch, and Belgian embassy compounds in Kuwait. President
Bush appeared on Iraqi television to say that country stands
"on the brink of war" because of its Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   In response, the Iraqis called the U.S. leader a liar and
vowed to fight him and his allies, many of whom increased
military and financial support of the U.S. stand against Iraq
following the embassy assaults. Secretary of State James
Baker returned to Washington after raising some $14 billion
for use in the Middle East crisis.
   The heightened Gulf tensions will doubtlessly continue to
push crude oil futures skyward, as they have for the past six
weeks. Trading early in the week should reveal whether a
recent slackening in petroleum product futures prices is
continuing. Some traders had attributed the weakness to
technical factors, but others took note of recent reports
from the U.S. Energy Department and the American Petroleum
Institute that showed increases in petroleum product
inventories. The weekly report from the API, due tomorrow,
will be scrutinized for more evidence that product stocks are
growing.

   Livestock and Meats
                                                                                                       

   A surge in hog and pork belly futures prices last week
makes analysts optimistic about pork's prospects this week,
with strong cash prices for pork likely to continue to
support futures prices. Analysts said cash prices rose
because of competitive bidding among meatpackers for supplies
for slaughter. A larger-than-expected movement of pork
bellies out of cold storage also exerted upward pressure on
prices.
   Also affecting the market last week were rumblings that
the U.S. may be planning a food aid package to the Soviet
Union, and analysts said such speculation may remain in the
market this week. "Traders are trying to make something out
of the meeting between President Bush and {Soviet President
Mikhail} Gorbachev," one analyst said. "Personally, I think
they had other things to talk about than food aid."

   Awards Contracts
   For Oil Platform

   OTTAWA -- A group of oil companies led by Mobil Oil Canada
Ltd. awarded $1.4 billion of contracts to international
engineering groups to build a giant production platform for
the Hibernia oil field off Canada's east coast.
   The concrete platform will be located in an area known as
Iceberg Alley and will be designed to withstand a direct
iceberg hit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The contracts were awarded Friday after Mobil and its
partners signed an agreement with the governments of Canada
and Newfoundland to undertake the $4.5 billion Hibernia
development.
   Doris Engineering of France, head of a group of companies,
received a $1.1 billion contract to construct the production
platform. A Canadian-European joint-venture led by SNC Group
Inc. of Montreal was awarded a $309.8 million contract for
engineering work.
   Canadian Energy Minister Jake Epp predicted Hibernia's
development would spur the development of other eastern
offshore oil fields including the Terra Nova, White Rose and
Ben Nevis fields.
   Hibernia, located off Newfoundland, contains between an
estimated 525 million and 650 million barrels of light, waxy
crude oil, most of which is expected to be shipped to oil
refineries in the U.S. Northeast. Production is expected to
begin in 1996 and continue for about 20 years. During the
peak production period in 1998, Hibernia is projected to
produce 110,000 barrels of oil a day.
   Mobil Oil Canada has a 28.1% stake in Hibernia. Its
partners include Gulf Canada Resources Inc., which is
controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family, with 25%;
government-owned Petro-Canada with 25%; and Chevron Canada
Resources Ltd., a unit of San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.,
with 21.9%. Mobil Oil Canada is a unit of New York-based
Mobil Corp.
   Some industry analysts claimed the Hibernia project
wouldn't be economic without the heavy financial support of
the Canadian and Newfoundland governments.
   The Canadian government agreed to contribute $2.3 billion
in cash and loan guarantees toward Hibernia's development
costs. It also agreed to provide the consortium with
interest-free loans if oil prices fall below $25 a barrel. In
addition, the government said it would provide loans to cover
part of any capital cost overruns. It also agreed to forgo
any government revenues generated by Hibernia until the
consortium repays all of its outstanding loans.
   The Newfoundland government agreed to forgo some sales and
income taxes on the project.
   John O'Connor, president of Mobil Oil Canada, said
Canada's investment into Hibernia "is sound." He predicted
Canada "will get its loans back and more besides."
   Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said that in addition to
Hibernia, there is a "significant level of excitement" about
Terra Nova's prospects.
   Petro-Canada is expected to submit early next year its
plans to develop the Terra Nova field. The field, which is
located about 25 miles south of Hibernia, is estimated to
contain 300 million barrels of crude.
   Husky Oil Ltd. says it plans to drill a further three or
four delineation wells in the White Rose field, which is
expected to contain between 200 million and 300 million
barrels. Currently there is one well being drilled in the
eastern offshore region.

   Some Light for Municipal Bond Investors

   Municipal bond investors are about to take a small step
out of the dark ages.
   These investors have long complained that they can't get
up-to-date financial information about state and local
governments whose bonds they buy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now Norwest Bank Corp., the big Minneapolis banking
concern that is trustee to nearly $20 billion of municipal
bonds, says it will for the first time provide limited
amounts of "market-sensitive" information to the financial
markets about the issuers whose bonds it oversees.
   Stockholders have long enjoyed a regular stream of
quarterly financial reports from corporations and quick
announcements of market-moving information, such as takeovers
or lawsuits that could affect the company's stock price.
   By contrast, municipal bondholders get skimpy and sporadic
financial information, especially for smaller issuers that
tap the debt market infrequently. It isn't uncommon for
investors first to learn that a municipal borrower is facing
trouble on the day its bonds default.
   The information Norwest will disclose isn't massive, nor
is it comprehensive. The bank said it will inform the markets
in the event a default occurs or when certain financial
measures, such as capital adequacy ratios, fall below
required levels. This is the same information that it
currently sends to small groups of existing bondholders.
   However, Norwest said it isn't ready to provide the
information that the markets considers most crucial: notice
that an issuer is drawing on insurance or letters of credit
to make principal and interest payments, dipping into reserve
funds to make payments or consistently making late payments.
These are considered potential default tip-offs.
   The banking concern said it will provide the information
through an electronic wire service operated by a unit of J.J.
Kenny &amp; Co. In the future, Norwest said, it will release the
disclosures to other electronic services, including one being
developed by the quasi-federal Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board.
   "We appreciate the fact that the marketplace needs
information to operate efficiently," said Tom Kraack, vice
president who heads the corporate trust department at
Norwest. "We just see it, pure and simple, as a
customer-service issue." He said the bank won't offer the
most sensitive information until certain legal issues are
made clearer, specifically the legal liability of trustees
providing information to the markets that concerns other
entities.
   "It's too risky for a trustee to move beyond that which is
explicitly allowable" within certain indentures, said Mr.
Kraack.
   But even this limited move has some people angry. The
National Association of Bond Lawyers said it may not be the
role of trustees like Norwest to provide information to the
entire market.
   Even the city of Minneapolis, one of Norwest's biggest
customers, is a bit upset. "Philosophically, it's the wrong
thing to do. The information belongs to the issuer, not the
trustee," said John Gunyou, finance director for the city of
Minneapolis. Mr. Gunyou said he is considering finding a new
trustee. `We're their largest customer and they never talked
to us about this."
   Mr. Gunyou says he's not against full disclosure. In fact,
he's an MSRB member and is working with the group to
establish the new electronic disclosure system.
   Among other things, Mr. Gunyou and the MSRB are irritated
that Norwest decided to act now, rather than wait the extra
months -- or even years -- it will take for the MSRB to have
its system up and running. The MSRB, along with the American
Bankers Association, which represents trustees, are
developing guidelines for trustees to use in sending default
and predefault information to the secondary or resale market
via the MSRB system. But the debate over the guidelines could
drag on for some time.
   The squabbling between the MSRB, municipal bond issuers
and bond trustees shows just how far away the municipal
market is from forging municipal-bond disclosure regulations,
even after years of debate.
   The current call for more municipal bond disclosure grew
out of the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation
of the 1983 default by the Washington Public Power Supply
System on $2.25 billion of tax-exempt bonds. It was the
largest municipal bond default ever and stunned many
investors, who considered the bonds ultra-safe and who had no
idea until it was too late that the WPPSS was having
financial problems.
   Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
new disclosure rules for new municipal issues. But the rules
didn't fully address the problem of disclosure to the
secondary market about issuers after an initial offering.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Jitters about the Persian Gulf, higher oil prices and
discomforting economic reports pushed prices of government
bonds lower. But investors continued to buy Treasury bills
and short-term notes, keeping prices of those securities
firm.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond was quoted late Friday at 97
4/32, down 19/32 from Thursday, to yield about 9.02%. The
twoyear note was at 100 5/32, down 1/32, to yield about
8.02%.
   Prices fell as soon as the market opened Friday. While
dealers and investors were preparing for a torrent of
potentially market-moving economic data at 8:30 a.m. EDT,
reports hit the wires that Iraqi troops had stormed the
residences of several Western ambassadors to Kuwait and had
taken prisoner a French military attache, who has since been
released.
   The government then released data showing that the
producer price index, a measure of inflation, jumped 1.3%
last month, while retail sales fell 0.6%. Later, a Federal
Reserve report revealed that industrial output fell 0.2% in
August and capacity utilization slipped 0.4 percentage point
to 83.1%.
   Although the news of weakening economic growth often would
boost bonds, concerns about the possibility of war in the
Middle East and higher inflation, which erodes the value of
bonds, overshadowed the bullish data.
   In the municipal bond market, yields on general obligation
bonds issued by Philadelphia topped 9% as prices were knocked
lower in response to the city's financial woes.
   "I have seen trades at yields as high as 9.50%" for
Philadelphia GOs, said Alan Schankel, first vice president
and manager of the municipal bond department at Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc.
   The latest blow to the city came at midday Friday when
Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating on
Philadelphia's long-term bonds to single-B from Ba. That's
the lowest rating of any major U.S. city.
   Prior to the Moody's rating action, traders had quoted
Philadelphia 8 1/4% bonds due 2009 at yields of about 8.80%.
   Philadelphia bonds also were hurt by other factors, such
as the loss of a letter of credit backing from Swiss Bank
Corp., which caused the city to postpone a $375 million
short-term note sale.

   Stock investors only have eyes for oil.
   Ever since Saddam Hussein lit a fuse under the Middle East
tinderbox on Aug. 2, the oil market has been shoving stocks
around. Mainly down, as was the case again Friday: The Dow
Jones Industrial Average sank 18.56 points to 2564.11, while
the October crude oil futures contract rose 69 cents to
$31.76 a barrel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since the invasion of Kuwait six weeks ago, the industrial
average has moved counter to oil prices on 22 of 30 trading
days. Of those moves, the industrial average fell -- and oil
rose -- more than half the time, or 14 days. On the days when
the predominant pattern didn't hold, changes in both the
industrial average and oil prices were mostly small.
   In a sense, oil simply has become the latest obsession of
stock investors, who love to seize upon an economic indicator
or some other windsock to point the direction they should run
in. Over the past year, the stock market has on occasion been
dominated for days and even weeks by bond yields, the monthly
employment report and inflation indexes, among other things.
   "Wall Street tries to make things very simple," says Al
Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards. "It's a
one-note street. But if one makes the mistake of following
that one note, you miss many critical factors. Admittedly, as
with oil, the myopic view often works -- but only on a very
short-term basis."
   But to credit the market monomaniacs with certain good
judgment, oil prices dovetail closely with the major issues
on investors' minds: inflation, economic growth or recession,
and corporate profits.
   "Inflation is the single most negative variable for
financial instruments," says A.C. Moore, research director at
Argus Research, "and the price of oil is the single most
important element. It affects pricing for everything.
Secondly, oil-price increases translate into diminished
demand throughout the economy. There's lots of justification
for being fixated on oil. It's not a phantom worry."
   Trouble is, when the obsession of the month is expressed
in a price, such as oil, the stock market tends to be yanked
around by those investors who are most sensitive to price --
namely, speculators. The impact of rising oil prices is felt
first in that part of the stock market that is most like a
commodity-stock-index futures.
   With buy and sell programs, jumps in energy prices are
telegraphed to the New York Stock Exchange through the
Chicago futures markets. "Nobody is going to pull or make a
bid based on the price of oil; but it is affecting the
{futures} market, which causes programs" in stocks, says
Michael LaBranche IV, managing partner at a Big Board
specialist company, LaBranche &amp; Co.
   Some advisers suggest investors try to take advantage of
the volatility. "When good companies get sold with the bad,
an investor can use that as a chance to buy or add to a
position," says Mr. Moore of Argus. He likes energy stocks
and shares of growth companies with large interests overseas,
such as the 48% of revenue and profit that Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing gets from foreign operations.
   Joseph J. McAlinden, director of equity research at Dillon
Read, also recommends playing the market's daily ups and
downs in pursuit of a longer-term strategy. He thinks
inflation is going to reaccelerate significantly, partly
because of oil prices but also because he predicts a much
looser monetary policy in the months ahead.
   This scenario is bad for the bond market and a mixed bag
for the stock market, he says. Companies that do well in
inflationary periods will see their stocks rise, and vice
versa. "Overall," he asserts, "the stock market will get
pulled higher over the next three to six months," led by
energy, basic industries such as metals and stocks of
companies that benefit from increased capital spending.
   Specifically, Mr. McAlinden likes Oryx Energy, a Dallas
company with significant oil interests in the North Atlantic,
and Burlington Resources, a natural-gas play.
Capital-spending stocks he favors: CBI Industries, an Oak
Brook, Ill., company that builds pressurized tanks for gas
and oil, and Motorola, which is big in semiconductors and
cellular telephones. Among natural-resource concerns, he
recommends Amax, a metals producer.
   If you believe in these plays, he says, buy them on days
when inflation fears subside; and sit on your hands on days
when oil prices -- and inflation fears -- rise.
   Ellen Harris, chief domestic investment officer of
PaineWebber mutual funds, suggests investors look at stocks
whose ability to earn fatter profits aren't vulnerable to oil
shocks. A favorite is Waste Management, and biotechnology
stocks such as Chiron and Genetics Institute. "Their growth
isn't affected by the events going on" in the Middle East,
she says.
   Fred Moran, president of Moran Asset Management, thinks
investors should insulate themselves against recession in the
U.S. as well as against the oil shock. He is avoiding
cyclical groups such as airlines, autos and retailers and
buying stocks of companies that generate sales no matter how
slow the economy, such as cellular telephone and cable
television concerns.
   "When there was a recession in Dallas and Houston,
cellular prospered as well there as anywhere in the country,"
he says. "Telecommunications grows even in a recession, or if
oil prices are high." Among his favorites are McCaw Cellular,
Associated Communications and Jones Intercable.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Evidence of growing tensions in the Persian Gulf and
sluggishness in the U.S. economy weighed down the stock
market and prices closed broadly lower.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 18.56 to 2564.11,
with 1,008 issues declining and 472 advancing.
   Among broader market indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index dropped 1.82 to 316.83, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index slipped 1.01 to 174.15 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index fell 1.78 to 293.61.
   Some 133,390,000 shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange -- the highest total since Aug. 27 -- but the
pattern of lackluster activity since the end of last month
remained intact as many institutions stayed out of the
market.
   For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a
decline of 55.44 points, or 2.1%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index each dropped 2%, while the Big
Board's composite index fell 1.9%.
   Prices headed lower from the opening bell as the market
responded to the report on August producer prices, which rose
sharply as expected, and other data on the economy's
performance last month that proved mildly disappointing.
   The producer price index jumped 1.3% last month, well
within market forecasts, as a result of the steep increase in
energy prices following Iraqi's invasion of Kuwait. But
despite sharply higher sales at gasoline stations, retail
sales fell 0.6% in August; additionally, industrial
production fell 0.2% and capacity utilization dropped to
83.1% in August from 83.5% in July.
   A sell-off in Digital Equipment gained momentum, with the
stock falling to its lowest level in about five years.
Digital, the most active Big Board issue, dropped 2 7/8 to 56
3/8 on trading of 2.2 million shares. Digital traded as low
as 54 3/8.
   The latest round of selling took place after Cowen &amp; Co.
slashed its estimate of the company's fiscal 1991 earnings by
$2.85 a share, to $4.15. Analyst Richard S. Chu told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report the sharp revision
reflects increasing concerns about the economic outlook and
about Digital's current midrange computer line. Several
analysts had lowered earnings estimates earlier last week as
the company made downbeat presentations at two investment
conferences.
   LSI Logic tumbled 1 to 6 7/8 after Prudential-Bache
Securities cut its earnings estimates for this year and next
by 10 cents a share to 50 cents and $1.20, respectively. But
a number of other technology issues bucked the market's
slide; Compaq Computer gained 7/8 to 44 1/8, Cray Research
went up 1/4 to 35 3/8, Texas Instruments climbed 1 to 28 1/4
and Motorola rose 1 5/8 to 63.
   Deere fell 2 3/8 to 51 1/8 and Tenneco dropped 1 7/8 to 52
1/8. Oppenheimer &amp; Co. cut 1991 earnings estimates on the two
concerns and removed the stocks from its list of recommended
issues. Additionally, Wertheim Schroder lowered its forecast
of Deere's 1991 earnings from $6.35 a share to a range of $5
to $6.35.
   Westinghouse Electric fell 1 5/8 to 29 7/8 on 1.1 million
shares. PaineWebber lowered the stock's investment rating
from "attractive" to "neutral" and cut its 1991 earnings
estimate by 10 cents a share, to $3.60, to reflect the
company's new forecast of a recession beginning later this
year.
   Energy stocks closed mixed as oil prices reacted to the
Mideast developments. Exxon gained 5/8 to 51 3/8, Chevron
fell 1/8 to 75 7/8, Texaco rose 1/8 to 65 1/2, Mobil eased
1/8 to 65 1/2 and Atlantic Richfield added 1 1/8 to 139 7/8.
   The precious metals sector, benefiting from higher gold
prices, fared even better.
   Battle Mountain Gold added 3/8 to 10 5/8, Placer Dome
gained 1/2 to 17 1/8, Homestake Mining climbed 3/8 to 19 7/8
and American Barrick Resources rose 1/2 to 21 3/8.
   Chemical Banking fell 5/8 to 20 1/4 as 1.7 million shares
changed hands. Speculation has surfaced recently that the
company may be about to close its operations in Switzerland;
Chemical has declined to comment on those rumors.
   Prime Motor Inns declined 3/8 to 1 3/8 on 1.7 million
shares. The company said it asked its bank lenders to
restructure its debt and to provide an additional $25 million
in loans, adding that it could file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection if an agreement can't be reached.
Prime Motor Inns L.P., from which the company leases several
hotels, fell 7/8 to 3 1/4.
   Olin dropped 2 7/8 to 37 1/8. The company said it expects
to post earnings of about $5 a share this year, below both
analysts' estimates and the company's previous forecasts.
   Manpower rose 5/8 to 11 1/8. The company agreed to sell
five British-based units to Brook Opportunities, a new
company, for about $200 million and will also receive a 15%
stake in Brook.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
0.56 to 321.45, bringing its loss for the week to 0.7%.
   Energy Service, the most active Amex issue, rose 1/8 to 3
5/8. The company, together with R.D. Smith &amp; Co., agreed to
sell 33 oil drilling rigs belonging to Penrod Corp. for $14.9
million to Diamond M Holding.
   Ackerley Communications rose 1/2 to 3 1/4. Business Week
magazine reported that one money manager, Starmont Capital's
Michael Seyfert, is estimating the company's net asset value
at $15 a share, while portfolio manager Harvey Sandler puts
the figure at more than $20 a share.

   SEC Alarmed by Accounting Standards
   Industry Adopted for Financial Concerns

   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
expressed dismay at new standards the accounting industry has
adopted for financial institutions, and the agency urged that
the standards be tightened sharply.
   At issue is the way financial institutions, mostly banks
and thrifts, account for debt securities they hold for
investment. Under current accounting rules, such securities
are marked at their historic cost, while debt securities held
for short periods and used as trading assets are marked to
the market price.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SEC, in a letter to an accounting industry panel, said
the current method has "repeatedly proven to be irrelevant to
valuing investment portfolios." The agency said all debt
instruments should be marked to the market price.
   The letter -- from Edmund Coulson, the SEC's chief
accountant, and Robert Bayless, chief accountant of the SEC
corporation finance division -- follows an effort last week
by the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to change
the current rules. The committee voted Thursday to force
banks to disclose in notes to financial statements
information about the amortized cost and market value of
their investment holdings.
   The SEC wasn't satisfied with the vote, which represented
a significant pullback from earlier committee proposals that
would have required financial institutions to report in
financial statements themselves any changes in the portfolio
value of debt held as investments. The committee's original
plan drew protests from accountants and bankers, who argued
that marking all debt securities to market would cause wide
swings in earnings reports.
   The SEC dismisses that view. "Any volatility is a product
of a financial institution's investment portfolio," the
agency said in its letter. "Accounting standards ought not to
conceal the reality they are established to portray."
   Mr. Coulson said in an interview that AICPA's move was "an
interim measure" but "not the final answer."
   The SEC letter argues that the panel shouldn't "seek to
redefine the distinctions between `trading' and `investment'
securities, but to recognize that these distinctions cannot
justify permitting a reporting company to overvalue assets"
with a specific value.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden made similar comments earlier
last week to the Senate Banking Committee. He said Friday
that he is worried that some banks' financial statements
should carry the caution "once upon a time" at the top of the
page.
   Mr. Breeden cited the thrift crisis as a clear
illustration of the flaws of the current accounting system.
In an interview, he explained that in 1980, when Congress was
considering proposals to deregulate the thrift industry, S&amp;Ls
were showing a positive net worth of $36.2 billion. But on a
mark-to-market basis, their net worth was actually "somewhere
between minus $78 billion and minus $118 billion," according
to later research.
   The failure of thrifts to reflect their true value
accurately, Mr. Breeden said, "was a significant factor in
delaying the understanding by the public of the actual
condition of the thrift industry."

   GOP Proposes
   Limit Covering
   Tax Deductions

   WASHINGTON -- Republicans proposed a limit on all tax
deductions for taxpayers making more than $200,000 annually,
in their continuing effort to persuade Democrats to accept a
cut in the capital-gains tax rates, according to top
congressional aides.
   The Republicans made the counteroffer during budget talks
yesterday after rejecting the Democrats' bid to pair the
capital-gains tax cut with higher income taxes on the rich.
Though Democratic leaders have repeatedly suggested the
trade-off, the proposal marked the first time they had done
so formally during the four-month-old budget summit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tax issue, which has loomed large over the
deficit-reduction talks, has intensified as fiscal deadlines
approach. Without a budget package to reduce the fiscal 1991
deficit, projected at more than $250 billion,
across-the-board cuts of at least $85 billion would take
effect after the fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
   President Bush and GOP negotiators have insisted that
capital-gains taxes be reduced, while adamantly opposing any
offsetting increase in income-tax rates. To date, Republicans
have said they want to leave the relative burdens on rich and
poor about where they are today, but Democrats have pressed
their drive to use the deficit-reduction package as a vehicle
for a more progressive tax code -- that is, one that would
require upper-income Americans to pay more.
   The Republican proposal would set the limits on deductions
for families earning more than $200,000 at levels sufficient
to bring more than $20 billion into the Treasury over a
five-year period. That sum would offset the estimated
five-year revenue loss from the GOP capital-gains proposal.
   Earlier this summer, Republicans proposed limiting the
deductions the wealthy can take for state and local taxes to
$10,000, a change that would affect mostly the rich in
certain states, such as California and New York. The GOP's
new approach would cover all of the deductions, including
those for mortgage interest and charitable donations. The
congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that
almost everyone who earns more than $200,000 annually takes
deductions, while less than one-quarter of those making under
$50,000 take advantage of the deductions.
   Democrats have made similar proposals in the past. Rep.
Don Pease (D., Ohio), a member of the tax-writing Ways and
Means Committee, has circulated a plan that would trim all
deductions for families with incomes above $100,000 annually
and single people with incomes above $50,000.
   In yesterday's budget talks at Andrews Air Force Base,
where participants have secluded themselves for more than a
week, Democrats made their conditional offer to accept
reduced capital-gains taxes in return for higher income tax
rates to a small group of negotiators who were meeting to
thrash out tax issues, the congressional aides said.
   "This is the crunch point," one of the aides said.
"Without this combination, these talks are going nowhere."
   The Republicans are seeking to cut the maximum
capital-gains rate to 15% from 33%. Under the Democratic
version, the top capital-gains tax rate would effectively be
23.1%, an aide said.
   In return for the tax cut, Democrats proposed to raise the
top marginal income tax rate to 35%. In doing so, that would
end an anomaly in the tax code that allows the wealthiest
Americans to pay a top marginal rate of 28%, while some less
well-off taxpayers pay a top rate of 33%. Democrats also
proposed to raise the alternative minimum tax for individuals
-- paid by upper-income individuals who would otherwise avoid
taxes under the regular tax system -- to 25% from 21%.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D., Wash.), who one of the
congressional aides said was present when the Democratic
offer was made, gave some hint of the proposal earlier
yesterday on NBC's "Meet the Press." He said that Democrats
would agree to cut capital-gains taxes only "if there were a
balancing burden-sharing by high-income, wealthy taxpayers."
   "We have to have a balance," agreed Senate Republican
Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who also was on "Meet the
Press." "We have to have progressivity, and I think we're
going to have it."
   By his comment, Sen. Dole turned up the pressure on his
fellow GOP negotiators to support, in exchange for any
capital-gains tax cut, some offsetting changes that would
shift more of the tax burden to the wealthy.
   The issue of progressivity gained prominence at the talks
last Friday after published reports, in this newspaper and
others, that analyses showed the administration's tax ideas
would benefit those taxpayers with annual incomes above
$50,000, and add to the burden for those making less. In
contrast, the Democrats' proposals would increase the tax
liability for those making more than $20,000 a year, and
lighten the burden for those with incomes below that amount.
   Publication of those conclusions from the bipartisan Joint
Committee on Taxation infuriated Republicans, who already are
sensitive to Democrats' election-year drive to paint the GOP
as the party of the rich. GOP negotiators took to the Senate
floor to accuse Democrats of leaking the analyses for
political gain.
   Sen. Dole, his voice quaking with rage, stopped just short
of saying the talks should be aborted. "If capital-gains
rates is the issue, we ought to solve it today, or nothing
else happens, period," he said Friday. "If everything blows
up, Democrats go, `Oh well, it blew up because Republicans
are trying to protect the rich.' We're not trying to protect
anyone. We're trying to do a very difficult job, in
cooperation with our Democratic colleagues. Of course, it's
not going to work if this garbage keeps piling up day after
day."
   Meanwhile, negotiators who are working on spending cuts
lost ground in yesterday's sessions, according to a top
congressional aide. Proposed savings of $128 billion over
five years in federal benefit programs has eroded to about
$90 billion as negotiators backed away from committing to
certain cuts in Medicare and other programs. Summit
participants have set a goal of $50 billion in budget cuts in
fiscal 1991 and $500 billion over the next five years.
   Negotiators have been considering proposals to make
Medicare beneficiaries pay substantially more for their
health insurance and to curb cost-of-living adjustments for
federal retirement programs. Also at issue are competing
schemes to alter the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   Sen. Dole said negotiators have set yet another deadline
-- midnight tonight. Past deadlines have come and gone
without success. Others close to the talks, however,
suggested it may take more time to complete what negotiator
Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) is calling "the blueprint for
federal spending for the next five years."
   Endorsing a suggestion that people close to the talks say
was first made by Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, yesterday on ABC's "This Week with
David Brinkley," urged that the Senate and House postpone any
floor votes until negotiators reach a compromise.

   Digital Equipment Stock Drop Isn't Over,
   Analysts Say, Despite Strong Fundamentals

   BOSTON -- Digital Equipment stock plummeted 2 7/8 Friday
to 56 3/8, its lowest point since 1985, but few analysts are
willing to bet it has hit bottom.
   On the surface, there is much to recommend the world's
second biggest computer maker at these levels. After all,
many analysts were boosting the stock in May when it hit a
12-month high of 95. Digital is likely to survive any
industry shakeout. It has about $17 a share in cash, a
sterling balance sheet and a current price far below the
$66-a-share book value long seen as a floor for the stock.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But with a deteriorating economy hurting sales world-wide
and a huge work force being pared only slowly, Digital's
outlook remains somber. Analysts slashed earnings estimates
last week. For the fiscal first quarter, ending Sept. 30,
many expect Digital to incur its second consecutive quarterly
loss.
   Moreover, there is growing doubt that Digital will
initiate cash dividends at its November annual meeting.
Digital's president and founder, Kenneth H. Olsen, indicated
last year that he had dropped his 33-year opposition to
paying dividends. A dividend would allow purchase of the
shares by institutions that are prohibited from buying stocks
without dividends. But now the chances of a dividend are
"very slim," says Jay P. Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds, who
was bullish on the stock most of the year.
   Analyst John Adams of Adams Harkness &amp; Hill notes that
Digital is pushing employees to leave under a voluntary
severance plan; he thinks a dividend is unlikely when
employees are being asked for sacrifices. Citing Digital's
reluctance to breach its no-layoff tradition, he says, "you
have to empathize with Ken Olsen. He is virtually the only
industrial saint around."
   Analysts expect Digital to start a new stock buy-back
program soon to bolster the shares. In April it began a
five-million-share buy-back for 4.1% of its stock.
Institutional traders said Digital finished that buy-back
last week, perhaps contributing to the stock's decline.
   Patricia Laupheimer at Shearson Lehman Brothers cut her
profit estimate last Monday after a Digital spokesman
"described 75% to 80% of their markets as sluggish." She
notes that some big, slow-growth computer stocks currently
trade at multiples of 10 or less times earnings while Digital
remains above that level, compared with Street estimates.
   For fiscal 1991, ending June 30, many analysts have cut
their estimates to $4 to $5 a share from a mean $6.22
estimate a few weeks ago. Last year's share earnings were
only 59 cents after a big restructuring charge, down from
$8.45 the year before. "The problem is you don't know what
earnings are going to be," says Steven Milunovich of First
Boston. "In the near term, there's not a lot of reason to be
optimistic."
   Many investors remain disenchanted by Digital's
cost-cutting efforts. Last spring the Maynard, Mass., company
began its first voluntary severance program with employment
at a record 125,800 persons. By next June, officials have
said, employment will be down to about 119,000.
   Nevertheless, analysts say Digital remains overstaffed
compared with competitors. Stephen Smith, a PaineWebber
analyst who recommends the stock long term, calculates that
if Digital's overhead and research and development levels
were similar to International Business Machines Corp., the
world's largest computer maker, and Hewlett-Packard Co.,
"that would add $8 a share to earnings. They hired too many
people in the boom days."
   John Levinson of Goldman Sachs, who has been bearish on
Digital and other makers of midrange computers for years,
says that its $103,000 revenue per employee, a measure of
productivity, is less than half that of Sun Microsystems, the
leader in the workstation market that Digital is trying to
crack. "I believe DEC has many more restructuring costs
ahead," he says.
   Skittish as most analysts are about Digital, they sound
like wild-eyed optimists compared with Marc Schulman of UBS
Securities. A longtime Digital watcher, he was recommending
the stock two months ago because he predicted accelerating
earnings momentum. Now he thinks the company will have a net
loss of $1 a share in the current quarter and only break even
for the full year because of weak revenue.
   Mr. Schulman thinks Digital may have a 1% revenue decline
from last year's $12.94 billion, even though the new VAX 9000
mainframe computer may add $1 billion in sales. Last year's
paltry 1.6% revenue gain came when the U.S. economy was
"muddling along" and Europe was strong, he says. Today, "the
U.S. economy is worse than before. The European economy is
worse than before and the degree to which users are willing
to buy minicomputers is worse than before."

   The global scramble for cash is leaving the U.S. with a
foreign "investment gap" that analysts warn will lead to a
weaker dollar, higher U.S. interest rates and a slower
American economy.
   If first-half trends continue, foreigners will invest $40
billion in the U.S. by year-end, down 72% from the $141.7
billion of U.S. stocks, bonds and "real assets" -- real
estate and companies -- they added to their holdings last
year, according to Salomon Brothers Inc. At the same time,
American investors are purchasing assets abroad at an annual
rate of $62 billion, up 16% from the $53.6 billion they
bought in 1989.

   This investment gap already has contributed to the
dollar's decline. From its highest point in the past 12
months, the dollar has dropped 20% against the mark, 18%
against the pound and 14% against the yen. And it ominously
suggests the dollar will drop further.
   "The danger is that if the markets began to form the view
that the U.S. authorities are happy to let the dollar fall,
then the fall could easily turn into a rout," Mark Cliffe,
chief economist for Nomura Research Institute in London,
warned clients on Friday. A plunging dollar, he added, would
have "damaging implications . . . for U.S. financial
markets," including stocks and bonds.
   Analysts say the dollar's recent weakness indicates that
foreigners are still shying away from U.S. markets.
   In fact, long-term capital outflows (investments of a year
or more) from the U.S. currently exceed capital inflows. The
only other time this has happened since 1982 was during the
October 1987 global stock market crash, says Nicholas P.
Sargen, an international economist at Salomon Brothers.
   A continuing dollar decline, he and other analysts add,
could keep U.S. interest rates from falling more than they
otherwise would, and possibly even push them higher. Higher
rates would, by themselves, tend to buoy the dollar. But they
would cause bond prices to fall, and if they slow the U.S.
economy into a recession, they probably would push down stock
prices, too.
   Foreigners have already become net sellers of U.S. stocks
after being net buyers last year; their net purchases of U.S.
bonds are off 48%, and their acquisitions of real assets are
down 71%. Meanwhile, Americans bought a record net $10.9
billion of foreign stocks and bonds in the second quarter.
And on an annual basis, their purchases of foreign bonds are
nearly four times last year's amount.
   If this trend persists, Salomon Brothers predicts that $22
billion of investment money will leave the U.S. this year,
compared with a 1989 net inflow of $88.1 billion. And
prospects for a reversal aren't good.
   "I don't see a quick turnaround to this pattern," says Mr.
Sargen. "With interest rates higher abroad, why would
foreigners want to keep buying U.S. bonds?" And while "the
dollar is cheap, our assets are unattractive to overseas
investors because our interest rates are too low and our
investment prospects stink."
   In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at
1.5710 marks and 136.95 yen, compared with 1.5677 marks and
136.20 yen late Thursday. The British pound rose to $1.8930
from $1.8825.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
136.53 yen, up from 136.52 yen at the close there Friday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5583
marks, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.5695 marks.
   A weak dollar helps to lower the U.S. trade deficit by
reducing American export prices while making imports more
expensive. But it also exacerbates U.S. inflation, both
through the higher import prices and the opportunity they
offer U.S. manufacturers to boost domestic prices.
   Behind the foreigners' retreat from U.S. markets and the
growing appeal of foreign securities to Americans are rising
interest rates abroad, the expectation of lower U.S. rates, a
falling dollar and a softening U.S. economy.
   On a semi-annual compound yield basis, 10-year U.S.
Treasury bonds currently yield 8.85%. That compares with
11.81% for equivalent British bonds, 8.83% for West German
and 7.70% for Japanese bonds. On Friday, the yield on the
benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond set a new high for
the year.
   Yields abroad are even more attractive on an
inflation-adjusted basis. That's because inflation in West
Germany and Japan is about 3% compared with nearly 5% in the
U.S.
   "The narrowing of interest-rate differentials is making
domestic {Japanese} paper more attractive, especially
considering exchange-rate risks," says Michiya Matsukawa,
Tokyo-based chairman of Nikko Research Center Ltd. and a
former vice minister of finance. He adds that with higher
yields available at home, Japan's big life insurance
companies are finding it more profitable to lend domestically
rather than invest abroad. Indeed, in the first six months,
Japanese investors sold a net $8.9 billion of U.S. stocks and
bonds, according to the Ministry of Finance.
   Yet interest rates aren't the whole story. U.S. and
foreign investors have been drawn to European and smaller
Asian economies and stock markets. German companies, for
instance, began investing in East Germany and the rest of
Eastern Europe, once the countries were free of Communist
rule.
   The long-term investment gap is a serious problem for the
U.S. -- and the dollar -- because it means that foreigners
now must finance not only the U.S. current-account deficit,
but also the anticipated long-term capital outflows. The
current account includes trade in goods and services plus
certain financial transfers. The U.S. balance of payments
comprises the current account, plus long-term and short-term
capital flows (investments with maturities of less than one
year). By definition, the payments account must be in
balance, like a check book.
   For years, net foreign investment in the U.S. has helped
finance the current-account deficit. Last year, for example,
the $88.1 billion of long-term capital inflows reduced the
$110 billion current-account deficit to $21.9 billion. The
rest was financed by private short-term capital inflows,
commercial bank lending or foreign central banks.
   This year, however, the current-account deficit, which had
been shrinking, should widen again, mainly because of higher
oil imports. And because long-term capital inflows have in
fact become net outflows at an annual rate of $22 billion,
the gap that foreigners must finance becomes even wider.
   The question is how and at what cost that gap will be
financed, especially since nearly everyone predicts a weaker
dollar, which will further turn international investors away
from American markets.
   "We have a situation where the foreign official sector has
to make up the difference; or the dollar will have to come
down to a point where investors buy, either because they
think it has bottomed out or because U.S. real assets look so
cheap," says Robert T. McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank
Ltd. in New York. Noting that foreign official institutions
-- mostly central banks -- helped fill the gap in the second
quarter by buying a net $6 billion of U.S. government
securities, he expects them to continue buying. But not until
the dollar tumbles some more.
   David Horner, senior financial strategist at Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co., predicts that the dollar could fall to 1.42 marks and
132 yen in coming months. "I just don't see a case for the
dollar bouncing," he says. Mr. Sargen of Salomon Brothers
forecasts that in the first part of 1991, the U.S. currency
will be trading between 1.40 and 1.50 marks and could even
drop to the 120-130 yen range. That would put the dollar
below its post-World War II low of 1.5385 marks, set on Aug.
27, and near its record low of 120.25 yen, set on Jan. 5,
1988.
   "The wild card is the uncertainty surrounding the Mideast
crisis," says Mr. Sargen. He and others warn that if war
breaks out, the dollar could rebound as investors flee to it
as a haven.
   The dollar is vulnerable because the Federal Reserve is
expected to ease monetary policy shortly, either because of
an accord to reduce the budget deficit or to counter
recessionary trends in the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, many
analysts expect Germany and Japan to tighten monetary policy
to counter domestic inflationary pressures.
   "Japanese investors are incredulous that the Fed could
even be considering an easing move at a time when every other
major central bank is considering tightening," says David M.
Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a unit of
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. He adds that foreign investors
believe that the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond must
rise a full percentage point or more from its current 9%
level to be attractive.
   "The implication is that U.S. long-term rates must move
significantly higher to remain competitive for a limited
amount of global capital in the midst of a recession," says
Mr. Jones. He believes that with a slowing economy, domestic
U.S. investors will fill part of the gap, keeping long-term
rates at current levels. Still, he concedes, that will do
little to help revive the economy.
   "In the past, whenever the Fed eased in a recession,
long-term rates came down in line with short-term rates,"
says Mr. Jones. "But this time, they may not budge or
conceivably could even go higher."
   Mr. McGee of Tokai Bank expects foreign central banks to
step in. He notes that the finance ministers and central bank
heads of the seven major industrial countries are scheduled
to meet next weekend, and adds: "They are going to have to
reach agreement about under what conditions they would
seriously become buyers" of dollars to keep the currency from
plummeting. He believes central banks will intervene once the
dollar falls below 1.50 marks and 130 yen, which he expects
to occur before year-end.
   Separately, on the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday,
gold for current delivery settled at $385.10 an ounce, up
$2.20. Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$386.45 an ounce.

   LUBBOCK, Texas -- Unit holders of Furr's/Bishop's
Cafeterias L.P. would become stockholders of a public company
if they accept an exchange offer by general partner Cavalcade
&amp; Co. Inc., in yet another conversion of a master limited
partnership to corporate ownership.
   Furr's/Bishop's 20,000 public limited partners would
receive 75 cents in cash, six-tenths of a share of $9
convertible preferred stock, and one-fourth of a share of
common stock for each partnership unit they own. Cavalcade
Chairman Michael J. Levenson beneficial owner of 41% of the
partnership, would exchange his units for common stock
representing 61% of the new publicly held Furr's/Bishops.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Public unit holders would have the right to sell 56% of
their common-share holdings back to the company at $5 per
share aproximately four months after the exchange.
Approximately six months after the exchange, the preferred
shares can be exchanged for $10.88 in common equities in
Furr's/Bishops.
   Mr. Levenson's stake in Furr's/Bishop's would increase to
72% if all of the common stock is sold back. He would be
diluted to 52% if all of the preferred shares are converted
to common. Mr. Levenson declined to put a value on his offer
for the public units, which closed Friday in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading unchanged at $5.375.
   Apache, NRM, Devon Energy already have abandoned MLPs in
favor of share ownership. Existing MLPs were grandfathered
for 10 years in a 1987 law that wiped out their tax
advantages. On Wall Street, MLP prices almost always
reflected yield calculations of their distributions.
   Furr's/Bishop's paid out $22 million in the 12 months
ending June 30. Mr. Levenson said Furr's/Cavalcade would have
paid $7.2 million in dividends for the period had it been
owned by preferred and common shareholders.
   Furr's/Bishop's wants to use retained profits for
expansion and renovation, Mr. Levenson said. "Partnerships
served their purpose," Mr. Levenson said. "Tax laws change
and markets change. We feel we need the money for other
purposes."

   WASHINGTON -- The head of the American Insurance
Association told a House subcommittee that the state
insurance regulatory system may be unable to handle the
problem of insurance company insolvencies in the future.
   "The limitations of 50 separate entities attempting to
regulate a business that often operates in a national or
international arena may necessitate some federal
involvement," Robert E. Vagley, president of the trade group
for property and casualty insurance companies, told the House
Energy and Commerce Committee panel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The hearing was held in connection with the subcommittee's
investigation of insurance company insolvencies.
   Mr. Vagley said the AIA is considering several proposals
to complement state insurance regulations, including federal
minimum standards and the creation of a self-regulatory
organization.
   The trade group official said the most serious problem
connected with state regulation of insurance companies "is
the lack of will on the part of state regulators to take
action against troubled insurers."
   He added, however, that the insurance insolvencies
detailed in a February report by the oversight subcommittee
"were not representative of the thousands of well-managed
companies that characterize the property-casualty insurance
industry."
   Mr. Vagley also objected to comparisons between the
insurance industry's problems and the thrift crisis.
   "Whereas regulation of the savings and loan industry was
liberalized to permit operations to become more risky,
regulators of the insurance industry have enacted stricter
solvency standards over the past decade," Mr. Vagley said.
"Having said that, it is important to note that insurance
regulation for solvency can and should be improved," he said.
   Meanwhile, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the
subcommittee, repeated his call for more stringent regulation
of the insurance industry, warning that it could be headed
for "a solvency crisis rivaling the savings and loan
debacle."
   Mr. Dingell said the panel's investigation shows that the
current system for preventing insurance insolvency "is
failing to meet the needs of the public and the insurance
industry in several crucial areas."
   "Our goal is to combine the industry's expertise with the
appropriate governmental authority to see that proper
solvency regulation is implemented before a national crisis
develops," Mr. Dingell said.

   Sought By Ferruzzi

   CHICAGO -- A federal court turned down Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A.'s request for a restraining order to
prevent the Chicago Board of Trade from undertaking
disciplinary proceedings against the Italian concern.
   The CBOT said its Business Conduct Committee will decide
next week, as scheduled, on charges that the Milan grain
merchant attempted to manipulate the soybean market in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ferruzzi said it was "disappointed" by the ruling but
noted that the petition was only "the first step" in seeking
judicial redress of what it called the CBOT's "unfair
treatment."
   Ferruzzi had filed two suits. One alleged that the CBOT
violated antitrust and commodities law when it issued a 1989
order that forced soybean traders to close out their
positions. That order forced Ferruzzi to liquidate a
potentially lucrative long, or buying, market position in
soybean futures, whose value had climbed because of a
drought.
   Ferruzzi claimed the exchange issued the order not in
response to a market emergency, but to protect companies
affiliated with CBOT board members from suffering big losses
because they were holding short, or selling, positions.
   The second suit alleged that the CBOT, because of a
conflict of interest, shouldn't be allowed to render judgment
on Ferruzzi involving the 1989 soybean-market activities. It
was the latter suit that asked the court to block the
disciplinary hearing which was ruled on; the litigation
alleging the CBOT acted wrongfully remains pending.
   The CBOT has denied any wrongdoing.
   In a prepared statement Friday, the CBOT said it is
"pleased that the federal court has reaffirmed the exchange's
responsibility and right to conduct investigations of
violations of its rules and to take disciplinary action in
defense of the integrity of our markets."

of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., said it will eliminate about
675 more jobs this year, or 14% of its 4,908-member
non-nuclear work force.
   The belt-tightening move is part of a process begun in
1988 and accelerated in June, when the company undertook an
intensive review designed to make it leaner and more
competitive with other energy suppliers.

   The cutbacks affect 60 managers and supervisors, 315
clerical and professional workers, and 300 union employees,
the company said. About 400 positions have already been
eliminated this year, mainly through an early-retirement
program.
   The utility said none of the 2,840 employees at its Palo
Verde nuclear power plant will be affected by the latest
reductions.
   Two vice presidents, Russ Hulse, 62 years old, and Chuck
Jarman, 54, are retiring, the utility said. Another vice
president, Dave Ellis, 51, has resigned. The departures
reduce the number of company officers to 13 from 16.
   Mark De Michele, president and chief executive officer,
said a major objective is "to reduce our pending
rate-increase request before the Arizona Corporation
Commission," which regulates utilities. Details of the
revised filing won't be available until later this year, he
said.
   "All of this is driven by increased competition and the
flattening in the Arizona economy," said a spokesman for the
utility. "It has nothing to do with Pinnacle West and
PacifiCorp."
   The two-year-old restructuring program began before
PacifiCorp, a utility holding company based in Portland,
Ore., launched its effort last year to acquire Arizona Public
Service or Pinnacle West. Earlier this month, PacifiCorp
dropped its pursuit in exchange for seasonal power swaps with
Arizona Public Service.

   WASHINGTON -- The administration stepped up its opposition
to legislation that would tighten the fuel-economy rules on
cars, releasing studies claiming that the measure would cause
increases in deaths and injuries.
   At a news conference, Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner called the bill, sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan (D.,
Nev.), a "highway fatality bill" and said he would recommend
President Bush veto the legislation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Skinner's meeting with reporters came after proponents
won a key procedural vote by a bigger margin than expected.
The Senate voted 68-23 to end a filibuster that had kept the
bill from being debated. The bill, which has gained momentum
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and subsequent embargo of
Iraqi oil, could come up for a vote late this week or early
next week.
   The legislation would require auto makers to increase the
fuel efficiency of their fleets by 20% in the model year 1995
and 40% by 2001.
   Mr. Skinner said existing technology won't allow
manufacturers to meet the requirements of the legislation
without a significant decrease in the size of American cars.
According to two studies done by the Transportation
Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
the Bryan legislation would require an 850-pound reduction in
the average weight of passenger cars. This, the study
asserted, would lead to an additional 600 to 1,140 deaths and
2,900 to 5,300 injuries a year.
   Sen. Bryan and others continue to contend, however, that
it is very possible for the goals of his legislation to be
met using currently available technology.
   A similar bill, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Boxer (D.,
Calif.), is pending before the House Energy and Commerce
Committee.

   In another move to head off a possible union buy-out bid,
Greyhound Lines Inc. asked the federal judge hearing its
Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy case to subordinate any
back-pay claims from striking Amalgamated Transit Union
members to the claims of all other creditors in the case.
   Greyhound made the request in a lawsuit filed with the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Corpus Christi, Texas, on Friday.
The suit alleges that the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound
Local Unions, the ATU bargaining unit, used violence in an
attempt to acquire the GLI Holding Co. unit at a price less
than fair market value or to drive it into bankruptcy.
Greyhound said the purpose of the suit was to "prevent the
union and its membership from profiting from their
misconduct."

<TEXT>
   "I am appalled and amazed that they would have the
temerity to make such assertions," said ATU General Counsel
Earle Putnam. Union officials have repeatedly denied
responsibility for the widespread violence against the
company since the ATU strike began on March 2. Greyhound
blames the attacks for the losses that forced it to file for
Chapter 11 protection.

   UAL Unions May Abandon Current Bid
   As Alliance With Coniston Is Terminated

   A group of United Airlines unions is likely to abandon its
most recent $201-a-share, $4.38 billion offer to acquire UAL
Corp. and has begun considering making a new lower offer,
according to people familiar with the group.
   However, the board of Chicago-based UAL may balk at a
lower bid, setting the stage for a possible new confrontation
with the pilots' union, which has been trying to gain control
of the carrier for three years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The union group signaled its intentions late Friday with
the disclosure that it had terminated an alliance with New
York money manager Coniston Partners, UAL's largest
shareholder with an 11.8% stake.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group said it took the step "in light of current market
conditions, and in order to maximize the {group's}
flexibility . . . to pursue any appropriate transaction for
the acquisition of UAL."
   Ending the accord with Coniston relieves the union group
of the legal obligation, imposed on members of any group
owning 5% or more of a company's stock, to make prompt
disclosures of changes in its plans.
   Severing the alliance also gives Coniston the freedom to
pursue a plan of its own to boost the price of UAL stock.
Coniston acquired its 2.5 million shares at an average
disclosed cost of $161 a share, and has a paper loss of $155
million.
   The next union offer seems likely to fall in a range of
$135 and $175 a share, a premium of 36% to 77% over the
current price. UAL stock closed Friday at $99, down $1.75, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The new
offer may include a stake of as much as 25% to be held by
existing UAL stockholders, with the unions keeping control.
   A source close to the group says the unions may use
financing from some of the suppliers who offered to help
finance the last bid. One proposal came from Airbus
Industrie, an aircraft maker owned by a European consortium.
   But any new offer is also likely to face both opposition
from the UAL board and skepticism from UAL stock holders.
This would be the fifth pilot-sponsored attempt since 1987 to
gain control of United.
   A $300-a-share, $6.79 billion offer led by pilots and UAL
management collapsed in October, triggering a mini-crash of
the entire stock market. And an April 9 offer of $201 a share
by pilots, mechanics and flight attendants -- but without
management -- faltered after several big banks balked at
participating, and fuel prices soared after Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
   When the UAL board in August granted the unions a
two-month extension -- until Oct. 9 -- to obtain financing
for its current bid, it said any new version would have to
provide "commensurate value" with the $201-a-share pricetag.
   "The board may say, we're not interested in any of this.
Let's get back to work," said one person familiar with the
situation. "We're running out of alternatives to
confrontation," said another.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, who faces the loss of his job
if the union effort succeeds, has shown signs of trying to
regain the initiative among UAL employees by promoting the
airline's recent accomplishments. He has highlighted United's
expansion into Europe, and its retaking the No. 1 rank among
U.S. airlines in passenger traffic for the last three months.
Such an effort could be designed to exploit dissension in the
employee ranks over any new bid.
   UAL management has also been pressing the UAL board for
permission to make a $10 billion new-aircraft order for
expansion. The union group managed to block the order early
this summer on the grounds it would have undercut the group's
efforts to get supplier financing. Mr. Wolf has denied any
intention of trying to thwart the union bid.
   If the UAL board rejects a new union bid, the unions,
which have been working without a contract, could respond by
threatening labor strife. But Coniston, which forced the
board to accept the last union offer by threatening a proxy
fight, has lost some clout. Three months ago Coniston
announced plans to disband, citing as one reason the reduced
availability of financing for deals like this one.
   In addition, in its latest attempt to gain bank financing,
the union group enlisted several parties who may be reluctant
to join a hostile bid. They include Gerald Greenwald, former
vice chairman of Chrysler Corp., the unions'
chairman-designate of UAL, and outside directors such as
Richard Monroe, a former top executive of Time Warner Inc.
Also, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., which joined the union advisers,
doesn't usually advise hostile bidders.
