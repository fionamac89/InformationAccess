   SAN FRANCISCO -- In the government's latest public service
announcement about AIDS, a young man and woman exchange
feverish kisses on a sofa until a television announcer
suddenly interrupts them.
   The announcer declares that even a healthy-looking person
can be infected with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
The young woman hits the remote control button to silence the
intruder. But the set keeps turning on until they're
thoroughly turned off. "The person you're with right now
could have HIV. . . . Talk to your partner," the announcer
concludes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That TV spot is one of a half-dozen created by WPP Group
PLC's Ogilvy &amp; Mather unit for the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control in a new phase of the federal TV campaign. The thrust
of the spots is to familiarize all Americans with the term
HIV -- the formal name of the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome -- and to prompt viewers to do
their own AIDS personal risk assessment.
   The ads, while pointed in their message of AIDS risk, are
solidly mainstream in tone. No needles are shown and not a
hint of gay eroticism sways their firm Middle American
stance. This orientation, a source of criticism from gay
activists in the past, is designed to make them palatable to
the networks in prime-time slots.
   "Television executives are in business to make money,"
says Gary Noble, assistant surgeon general and head of CDC's
AIDS Program. He spoke at a news preview co-sponsored by the
American Medical Association before the start of the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS.
   "We want to get all Americans to think about risk in their
lives, whether they've ever shared a needle or had sex with
someone at risk, or whether their partners ever have done
so," Dr. Noble says.
   The commercial, nicknamed "Sofa," isn't limited to one
ethnic group. It's available in both English and Spanish
versions, and it stars dark-haired actors with looks that
make the visual crossover from white to Hispanic. Black faces
are much in evidence throughout other spots.
   In a spot entitled "HIV Positives," the camera ranges
across a number of sound bites of people of all ages and
colors saying: "It's not going to happen to me." Then real
people infected with HIV, not actors, talk about themselves.
Christina, a girl on a beach, says, "I was really shocked
when I found out." A black woman says, "I got it from my
husband. I didn't know he used drugs." The speakers are
ordinary folks with whom the greatest possible number of
viewers can identify. The spot ends by admonishing, "If you
think you're tired of hearing about it, listen to some people
who are really sick of it."
   "We're trying to get their attention, but fear isn't the
goal," Dr. Noble says. Test audiences reacted negatively to
spots that were too frightening or accusatory.
   CDC plans to purchase air time in two pilot cities this
month, and follow the campaign with questionnaires, Dr. Nobel
adds. So far, he says, test audiences in Memphis, Tenn., and
Springfield, Ill., demonstrated 70% recall of the content of
the announcements. But knowledge isn't enough, he concedes.
"You have to change attitudes."
   Because the average incubation period from infection to
AIDS diagnosis is 10 years, there's also a spot designed to
tell men at risk that "testing positive isn't immediately the
end of the world," Dr. Noble says. Presumably appealing to
gays and other single men, a young mustached man named Gary
recalls his anxiety at being tested. Armed with the knowledge
that he's positive, he says, he's taking care of himself and
planning a return to school. "Life seems more important now,"
he says. But there's no male "significant other" in sight.
Thus, it's unclear how much the principal risk group will
respond to such a pitch.
   Dr. Noble said the $1.8 million campaign is scheduled to
begin airing by 8,500 network affiliate stations in mid-July.

   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Arrow Automotive Industries Inc. said
its board voted to end discussions on a possible sale of the
company and elected Jim Osment to succeed Harry Holzwasser as
chief executive officer.
   Mr. Osment also is president of Arrow, and formerly served
as its chief operating officer. Mr. Holzwasser will continue
in the post of chairman.

   The company said it was terminating its engagement of
Tucker, Anthony Inc., which was hired in March to pursue
strategic and financing alternatives, including a possible
sale. The hiring of Tucker was linked to the expiration of
secured financing arrangements at that time. Arrow announced
that it obtained replacement financing earlier this month.

   Controlling 61.6% Stake in Ansbacher,
   British Merchant Bank, Is Up for Sale
   ----

   Another venerable British financial institution is on the
block.
   Henry Ansbacher Holdings PLC said a combined, controlling
61.6% stake in the merchant bank is being offered by Pargesa
Holding S.A. of Switzerland, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A. of
Belgium and Banque Internationale a Luxembourg S.A. The 115.1
million-share holding, valued at #89.8 million ($153.5
million), is intended to be sold to a single buyer, Ansbacher
officials said. Under British takeover rules, any single
buyer of the Ansbacher stake also would have to make an offer
to holders of the remaining 38.4%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The announcement marks the latest in a series of offerings
of big stakes in British financial firms, as investors
reorganize their holdings following recent years of upheaval
in the City, London's financial district.
   In the biggest such shuffling, Willis Faber PLC, an
insurance services company, last year put up for sale its
substantial stake in Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, igniting a
bidding contest that ended with a friendly takeover of Morgan
Grenfell by Deutsche Bank of West Germany. In a smaller deal,
Bank of Yokohama Ltd. of Japan bought a controlling stake in
the merchant bank Guinness Mahon Holdings PLC. Several
British fund-management concerns have been taken over by
larger Continental European players in recent years.
   Some smaller investors that have stuck their toes in the
London markets are retrenching, as returns haven't reached
expectations. Meanwhile, bigger financial companies still are
acquiring British businesses in preparation for a unified
European Community financial market in 1992. Companies taking
a look at the Ansbacher stake are likely to include some
Continental European banks.
   The 61.6% stake "is more likely to go to a single buyer,"
Richard Fenhalls, Ansbacher's executive chairman, said. "Any
single buyer is likely to be a banking group who wants to
expand its presence in London prior to 1992."
   For Pargesa, the planned sale is the latest sign of
changed priorities, since groups led by Albert Frere, a
Belgian financier, and Paul Desmarais Sr., chairman of Power
Corp. of Canada, tightened their control over the
Geneva-based holding company last February.
   Pargesa has been trying to simplify its structure and
extricate itself from a series of financial investments in
the 1980s that have turned out to be strategic dead ends. The
company recently agreed to sell its stake in Cie. Financiere
de Paribas's Swiss unit back to the French investment banking
concern, and has been retrenching to its core financial
activities in Continental Europe.
   When it acquired control of Ansbacher in 1984, Pargesa was
trying to build itself up as a global merchant-banking
powerhouse. Since then, Pargesa has scaled its ambitions
down, and Mr. Frere, the financier, has indicated he wishes
to concentrate on investments in Continental Europe. A
Pargesa spokesman said the concern has become less wedded to
the idea of holding stakes for the long term.
   Pargesa's 1989 profit dropped to 4.6 million Swiss francs
($3.2 million) from a record 160.2 million francs in 1988.
The drop reflected a 200 million-franc write-off of Pargesa's
indirect stake in Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., the U.S.
securities firm, which collapsed in February. For 1990,
Pargesa has forecast its net income will rebound to exceed
the 1988 level.
   Mr. Fenhalls, the Ansbacher official, said that neither
the British publisher Robert Maxwell, whose interests own a
9.94% Ansbacher stake, nor the Kuwaiti financial investment
company Wafra Intervest Corp., which controls 11.6%, is
likely to enter the bidding fray.
   But it wasn't clear which names will be attracted to
Ansbacher's particular mix of businesses, which include
international banking, merchant banking and a highflying
media-merger practice. Chris Wheeler, a London-based analyst
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said initial interest may
come from the "same names" that previously looked at British
financial acquisitions, including several Japanese and French
banks. But it was far from clear which institution will find
Ansbacher a strategic fit.
   On London's stock exchange late yesterday, Ansbacher
shares closed at 78 pence, unchanged.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South Africa's trade surplus
widened to 1.08 billion rand ($404.9 million) in May from 333
million rand a year earlier and from 969 million rand in
April, the government's Customs and Excise Office said.
   The figures aren't seasonally adjusted, but export and
import data are adjusted to bring them in line with the
requirements for compiling the nation's balance of payments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   May exports totaled 4.69 billion rand, compared with 4.46
billion rand a year earlier, and imports amounted to 3.6
billion rand, compared with 4.13 billion rand.
   In the first five months of this year, exports amounted to
23.71 billion rand, compared with 21.93 billion rand a year
earlier, and imports totaled 17.62 billion rand, compared
with 17.8 billion rand.
   The trade figures include South Africa's exports of gold
bullion, the country's principal source of foreign exchange
earnings. Imports include the country's purchases of oil and
other petroleum products, despite the longstanding embargo of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

   ST. LOUIS -- May Department Stores Co. said its Venture
discount store unit filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public
offering of about 14% of Venture's common stock.
   May said the offering will help set a price for the
remaining Venture shares, which it intends to spin off to its
own shareholders after the public offering. May previously
said it was spinning off the discount store unit to
concentrate on its department store operations. Before the
offering, May said Venture will pay it a dividend of $305
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the
announcement "furthers the likelihood" that May will use the
dividend to buy back its stock. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, May closed at $55.75, down 75
cents.
   The offering of 2.3 million shares, which Venture said it
intends to sell for between $16 and $18 a share, also will
help strengthen Venture's capitalization at a time when the
discount-store industry is in flux. Ames Department Stores
Inc., a big discount chain, is closing stores and
reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   Venture said in the filing that it intends to step up the
pace of its new-store openings. It plans four stores in the
current fiscal year, five next year and eight in each of the
following two years.
   The lead underwriter for the offering, which is expected
to close in July, is Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.

   Chrysler's Search for Broader Alliances
   Intensifies Amid Strong Internal Debate
   ----

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is stepping up its
search for broader alliances amid strong internal debate over
how dependent the company should become on potential
partners.
   Currently, Chrysler is holding "intensified" talks with
Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, says a Chrysler executive familiar with
the situation. The direction of those talks could become
clear within the next month, Chrysler officials say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Fiat talks currently are at a "more advanced and
potentially more substantive stage" than past discussions
between the two companies, said a top Chrysler official, who
asked not to be named. However, he added, it's far from
certain that broader ties between the two companies actually
will result.
   Fiat officials are discouraging speculation that the
discussions will result in their making a sizeable equity
investment in the No. 3 U.S. auto maker. More likely, they
say, is a deal in which Fiat helps Chrysler develop new
models. In return, Fiat might get Chrysler's
pollution-control technology, or perhaps the right to
distribute Chrysler's Jeeps and minivans in Europe.
   Reports that Chrysler and Fiat may be drawing closer
sparked heavy trading in Chrysler's stock yesterday. The
shares closed in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at
$16.50, up 37.5 cents.
   News of the Chrysler-Fiat talks comes in the wake of two
developments that could add impetus to the discussions. Last
week, Chrysler canceled a joint vehicle-development project
with Renault S.A., a clear signal that Chrysler has soured on
the possibility of stronger ties with the French auto maker.
Also, Wall Street is becoming increasingly worried about
Chrysler's financial strength.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. last week lowered its credit
rating for Chrysler. S&amp;P said the auto maker is "particularly
affected" by the increasingly competitive North American auto
market and a "weakening of earnings and cash flow" caused by
softer demand for vehicles. The S&amp;P move followed by one day
Moody's Investors Service Inc. plans to review for a possible
downgrade $22.8 billion of Chrysler debt.
   In its action, S&amp;P also expressed concerns about
Chrysler's ability to handle plans to spend $15 billion in
the next five years on new products as well as to service its
$18 billion in long-term debt and unfunded pension
liabilities. Those factors, S&amp;P noted, seem to outweigh the
near-term benefits Chrysler will get from its ongoing $1.5
billion cost-cutting program.
   With stronger ties to other auto makers, Chrysler can
defray the high costs of developing new products and spread
its limited resources to update a broader array of vehicles.
Chrysler's new-product development has lagged in recent
years, and its market share has dropped as a result.
   However, the risk of alliances is that they might leave
Chrysler too dependent on other companies for its products.
Some executives argue that Chrysler shouldn't be so quick to
relinquish the ability to produce its own vehicles in the
future to solve immediate problems.
   The executive apparently most concerned about this risk is
Robert A. Lutz, president of Chrysler Motors, the company's
major unit. Mr. Lutz has repeatedly said he wants Chrysler to
develop a new small car on its own. The cost-savings of joint
product development, he argues, often are overstated.
   Nonetheless, one possible result of the Chrysler-Fiat
talks is just the opposite scenario. Rather than developing a
small car to replace the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance
in the mid-1990s, Chrysler would build the car off a chassis
that Fiat uses for its Tipo subcompact.
   Another possibility is that Chrysler will turn to Fiat as
a partner for the proposed Jeep JJ that Chrysler was
developing with Renault until last week. The small
sport-utility vehicle was being designed to compete with
vehicles such as the Suzuki Sidekick; but the market for
those vehicles has slipped lately, and it's unlikely that
Chrysler can pull off the project alone.
   Chrysler's existing ventures with other auto makers
include an agreement with Fiat to market Alfa Romeo cars in
the U.S. through Chrysler dealerships.
   In the past 18 months, Chrysler has agreed to form a joint
venture with General Motors Corp. to produce transmission
parts and signed a deal to market midsized cars built in
Canada by Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea. Chrysler has also
started building cars in a new plant in Normal, Ill., with
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan.
   Chrysler has longstanding marketing and
product-development agreements with Mitsubishi, 12.1%-owned
by the U.S. auto maker.

   TAMPA, Fla. -- Silk Greenhouse Inc. posted a loss for its
first quarter ended April 30 and said it has reduced its work
force by several hundred employees.
   The company also said its chief financial officer and two
outside directors resigned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The setbacks sent Silk stock tumbling to $2.125 a share,
down $1.125, in national over-the-counter trading.
   The company -- which sells artificial trees, flowers and
plants -- said its loss totaled $5.7 million, or 60 cents a
share. That compares with earnings of $360,000, or four cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 74% to $27.5 million from
$15.8 million.
   The company cited significant increases in all major
categories of expenses.
   To cut costs, the company said several hundred workers had
been released, both through attrition and dismissals. Eighty
employees were idled at corporate headquarters.
   Chairman and President Jere L. Bradwell said salaries of
several top executives, including his own, had been sharply
reduced. The company declined to elaborate on its loss, the
staff cuts or its outlook.
   Silk also said John Stokely, its chief financial officer,
who had joined the company only last month, had resigned for
personal reasons. Moreover, two outside directors resigned,
also for personal reasons.

   On the Western Waterfront, a Powerful Case for Commerce

   In a rumble on the docks, you'd want "Eze" (as in easy)
Burts on your side. He's tanker-sized at 6-foot-4 with
shoulders built for heavy lifting. In fact, however, Ezunial
Burts has a desk job at the Port of Los Angeles. The big
desk. He's in charge of the facility, which claims now to be
the nation's leading commercial harbor.
   The Port of New York can still cite statistics to
challenge that ranking -- it depends on what you measure --
but there's little question that Los Angeles and neighboring
Long Beach are eclipsing East Coast locations. Trade patterns
favor the Pacific, and deregulation and other factors have
made LA the loading dock for much of the country. According
to Mr. Burts, as many goods are transshipped out of Southern
California as stay to service its huge and growing market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To varying degrees, the story is similar in Portland,
Tacoma, Seattle and Oakland. Nowhere is the American payoff
from world trade more evident than at the thriving West Coast
ports, whose cargo tonnage should triple over the next 30
years, according to one commissioned study.
   That kind of growth requires billions of investment
dollars and makes someone like the Port of Los Angeles
director unusual in these times -- a public-sector builder.
In years past, a Robert Moses in New York might remake a
city. Nowadays tax money is spent elsewhere and great sums
aren't available for infrastructure, and the objections of a
few -- who once were overwhelmed, rightly or wrongly -- are
enough to stop a big project. Yet Mr. Burts's capital
spending exceeds $100 million a year, and he says that must
increase if his harbor, man-made early in this century, is to
remain world-class.
   He can deal on that scale because the port is its own
revenue base, in effect a $156 million-a-year corporation
quasi-independent of City Hall. And Mr. Burts, while paying
due homage to "public responsibility" and acting in a
deliberate style that can be seen as politically calculating,
says he runs his agency like an enterprise. Customers are
prized, and the director goes seeking them around the world.
   At home, he does face community pressures. The bordering
working-class town of Wilmington suffers the underside of
port life, such as truck traffic and toxic spills, and Mr.
Burts has been a target of the reaction. In general, however,
the port has made great environmental strides and the water
is relatively clean. A plan to expand the Los Angeles and
Long Beach facilities massively by the year 2020 has stirred
objections to landfills, but is aimed at moving hazardous
material away from the shoreline. Likewise, a rail corridor
linking the ports with the central LA freight yards is being
built to handle 60 to 90 mile-long stacked-container trains a
day at grade separations so as not to clog roads.
   If this universe puts Mr. Burts, at age 43, in the top
ranks of black U.S. executives, he can thank his political
stars. A couple of years after majoring in public
administration at his hometown college, California's Fresno
State, he won an urban fellowship from the National League of
Cities that brought him into the orbit of Tom Bradley, soon
to be elected Los Angeles mayor. For more than a decade, he
assumed increasingly powerful staff posts under Mr. Bradley,
until being named to head the port in 1984. Two years later,
he won a dogfight with another longtime Bradley ally who had
dominated the port from his seat on the Harbor Commission.
   In his fashion, Mr. Burts downplays the early difficulties
in a post that typically had gone to someone from shipping.
He says he exemplified a "changing of the guard" at ports,
hospitals and other specialized institutions, as generalists
skilled in management broke a more parochial mold. He also
reflects a dramatic coloration of the port's leadership in
recent years, as its officials increasingly mirror the makeup
of a polyglot city.
   The port's growth spurt, of course, predates Mr. Burts's
tenure. It is a highlight of Mayor Bradley's 17-year reign.
Traffic began to take off in 1976 and is up 150% since.
Aggressiveness is one reason. "We have 14 offices around the
globe" for marketing, says Mr. Burts. "We're not sitting here
in Los Angeles waiting for cargo to come." Often, that
entails putting manufacturers in touch with markets.
   With shipping companies now permitted to link formally
with ground carriers, the nature of the players changes. "A
steamship line that used to just operate on the water can now
tell a customer, a Hong Kong manufacturing plant or one in
Taiwan, that {it} will take this cargo and deliver it to the
doorstep of a consumer in Iowa," says Mr. Burts. The port,
using offices in New York or Chicago, will step in to find
back-haul loads for the overland trip back to LA.
   Those kinds of connections, added to the Panama Canal's
political and structural problems, have made West Coast
ports, especially Los Angeles, a preferred gateway for
Pacific Basin goods going east. And what is exported? Mostly
raw materials -- coal, cotton, scrap metal, petroleum coke,
waste paper. Although the volume is as great as that
imported, the valuation is less. The Los Angeles Customs
District's trade deficit has been shrinking along with the
rest of the country's, however, and Mr. Burts says that local
manufacturers of electronics, aerospace equipment, clothing
and furniture ship overseas.
   Although use of cargo containers has been the shipping
story of the past generation, allowing the Port of Los
Angeles's expansion to occur while the number of dock hands
fell (to 20,000), Mr. Burts wants to diversify while
expanding in case trade shifts. Already, the port boasts of
repairing some Navy ships more cheaply than the Long Beach
Naval Shipyard, a target for closure by the Defense
Department.
   If that's a form of contracting out, could the port itself
be ripe for privatization? While acknowledging that's
occurring in Britain and New Zealand, Mr. Burts maintains
that with most of its operations leased out to shippers
anyway, the Port of Los Angeles is lean as it is. (Its
payroll has risen by only a third since 1976, to nearly 800.)
And its bond rating is strong. "When ports begin to get
strapped for cash, they start thinking about" privatization,
he says. "That has fortunately not been a serious issue at
this port. We think that the system that we have is one that
works well for us now, and for the next couple of decades I
don't see it changing."
   One thing Western ports would like to change is the
wage-and-hour provisions of their contract with the
longshoremen, which is up this summer. In a 24-hour-aday
business, it doesn't help to have downtime on the docks.
Nevertheless, Mr. Burts, perhaps mindful of the mess a strike
shutting down the whole coast would cause, has only praise
for labor.
   A record-holding quarter-miler while a student athlete,
Mr. Burts has settled into the somewhat slower and
less-celebrated arena of port management. Held to a $133,500
salary, he sees a shift to the more lucrative private sector
sometime in his future. For now, though, he occupies a
Promethean perch, a ready symbol and spokesman for the
benefits of free trade.

   Enterprise -- Fast Track:
   RPM Bases Success on Keeping Owners of Firms It Buys
   ---
   Formula Allows the Entrepreneurs
   To Retain Much of Their Autonomy

   MEDINA, Ohio -- Many entrepreneurs dread selling their
businesses. They swap tales of business owners who sold their
companies, stayed on to run the enterprise for the buyer --
and then left in a huff as the new owners made life
miserable.
   But RPM Inc., a holding company here, has grown fast by
buying companies, retaining the former owners -- and keeping
them happy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the past 24 years, RPM Chairman Thomas Sullivan enticed
25 business owners to sell their companies to him and run
them as divisions of his holding company. More surprisingly,
all of the former independent operators stayed, largely
because RPM let them retain much of their autonomy. The
owners who departed later did so only to retire.
   "I've sold them six companies and the principals are all
still there," says Connecticut business broker James Siebert.
"Usually, the principals get their money and leave."
   Adds Tony Rose, president of PCI Industries Inc., a
Riviera Beach, Fla., firm RPM acquired in 1986: "There's very
little interference. Four years after buying my company, it's
been just as they said."
   Not all of Mr. Sullivan's acquisitions worked out. Over
the years, RPM divested five firms, mostly small paint
manufacturers competing with larger concerns.
   In addition, some of the businesses RPM still owns have
legal problems. For instance, RPM's Mameco International Inc.
is negotiating with the Environmental Protection Agency to
clean up a liquid-waste site in Ohio. In a lawsuit filed in
the past year in circuit court in Brevard County, Fla., iron
workers at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station claimed injuries
from exposure to the company's paint products. RPM denied the
allegations.
   But overall, RPM's strategy of growing through
acquisitions has worked well. For the fiscal year ended May
31, 1989, RPM reported earnings of $24.2 million, nearly five
times the $5.1 million a decade earlier. Sales advanced to
$376.1 million from $101 million. Both earnings and sales
have risen for 42 consecutive years.
   RPM says retaining former owners has been central to this
success. Keeping an independent entrepreneur happy and
productive as an employee at a larger company isn't always
easy. But RPM shows how it can be done again and again.
   Mr. Sullivan negotiated RPM's first acquisition in 1966,
while a young manager at RPM, then a small chemical company
founded by his father, Frank. Thomas Sullivan and James
Karman, now RPM's president, took a traditional approach to
the troubled acquisition. Eager to revive the company, a
predecessor to RPM's Bondex International Inc., "we went to
St. Louis and fired literally everybody in the office,"
recalls Mr. Sullivan, now 53 years old. "I came back and told
my father what we did, and all hell broke loose." Some key
employees were rehired.
   Frank Sullivan told his son that acquisitions work best
when management comes with them. When the son succeeded his
father as chairman in 1971, he began buying dozens of small,
well-managed specialty-chemical companies. Most produce
mundane though profitable products, like waterproof sealants
and roofing materials.
   In courting owners, Mr. Sullivan negotiates acquisitions
personally, no matter how small they are. "You always have to
remember, regardless of its size, that an entrepreneur's
company is the most important thing in the world to him," he
says.
   When RPM finds a company it wants to buy, Mr. Sullivan
sometimes waits for years until its owner is ready to deal.
He met at least a dozen times from 1981 to 1984 with
Cleveland's Euclid Chemical Co. before its owner, Larry
Korach, decided to sell. When Mr. Korach did sell the
company, however, his son Jeff says he was so impressed with
Mr. Sullivan that he turned down a higher offer from a Swiss
firm.
   Even when acquisitions fall through unexpectedly, Mr.
Sullivan persists. In October 1987, after months of
negotiations that appeared to be going smoothly, the owners
of Baltimore's Chemical Specialties Mfg. Corp. broke off the
talks with RPM over terms of an escrow agreement. Robert
Hughes, one of the company's owners, doubted he'd ever hear
from RPM again.
   To Mr. Hughes's surprise, Mr. Sullivan wrote a letter that
December in an effort to reopen negotiations. He even sent
the entrepreneur a box of candy. The next year, Chemical
Specialties belonged to RPM.
   Keeping his entrepreneurs happy after they've signed on is
another task Mr. Sullivan emphasizes. He does it by
delivering on his promise of nearly total autonomy. Reports
of this independence naturally help attract other
acquisitions.
   Rather than relocate or merge the companies it acquires,
RPM almost always leaves them in place. As in many
acquisition arrangements, the former owners get a share of
their former firms' earnings.
   Decision-making, too, is highly decentralized, as the
meager growth of RPM's 14-person headquarters staff makes
clear. Since 1976, despite the purchase of over a dozen
firms, just two people were added.
   As operating-division presidents, RPM's entrepreneurs must
produce annual plans that headquarters refines and approves.
The process, beginning with a meeting in Florida, can be
tedious for previously freewheeling owners. But "once the
plan is written, we don't talk about these things again," Mr.
Karman says.
   RPM headquarters on occasion goes along even with things
that aren't in the plan. One time, for instance, Frank Pabis
decided to double production capacity of his Mohawk Finishing
Products Inc., the Amsterdam, N.Y., company that RPM acquired
in 1971. Mr. Pabis, who died in 1981, began constructing two
buildings at a cost of $1.5 million. The trouble was, says
Glenn Hornberger, Mohawk's current president, "he never
mentioned it to RPM."
   Mr. Karman learned about the plan when, during a phone
call to Mr. Pabis, he heard the rumbling of bulldozers in the
background. "We need two more buildings and we're building
them," Mr. Hornberger recalls his boss saying in response to
Mr. Karman's startled inquiry. "What do you want me to do?
Tear them down?"
   Mr. Sullivan reports that both are still standing today.

   What Am I Bid for Fifth Avenue?

   From David Dinkins's New York to George Deukmejian's
California, cities and states are worried over budget
imbalances. But they should worry no more. Through the
application of one of the most successful fund-raising
techniques of private charity, localities could wipe out
their budget shortfalls practically overnight.
   The technique is "memorialization" or memorial giving --
the practice of naming things for big givers. Depending on
their generosity or that of their kith and kin, those
memorialized can achieve varying degrees of immortality by
having their names attached to things ranging from an entire
college, medical center or cultural complex to a stained
glass window, hospital bed, pew or tree.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   During the Metropolitan Opera's $100 million Centennial
Endowment Campaign in 1979-1984, $2,500 could buy immortality
in the form of a brass nameplate screwed onto the back of one
of the Met auditorium's 4,033 chairs. (I have sat behind the
chair embellished with the name Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.)
   Why should this technique be restricted to private life?
Memorial giving could be a bonanza for financially strapped
cities and states. In New York City, for example, tens,
perhaps even hundreds, of millions of dollars could probably
be raised just by naming or renaming the 300 to 400 buildings
owned or leased by the city for housing its municipal
departments and agencies. The top price tags would most
likely be attached to the gorgeous Georgian City Hall, the
imposing Municipal Building and the marvelously baroque Hall
of Records, but a nice price could be had for the 984 largely
unnamed public schools, the 228 unnamed fire houses and the
75 unnamed police stations.
   New York also has 1,472 parks, playgrounds and public
spaces. Many of these parks are only a few acres in size, and
so well within the purse of persons of quite modest means.
The bigger parks -- such as Central and Prospect Parks --
could either be sold in one go to some wealthy
publicity-hungry purchaser or carved into pieces to permit
individuals to buy a single baseball diamond or pond, or even
park bench.
   The biggest windfall, however, would probably come from
New York's 6,402 miles of streets. The City Council already
authorizes about two dozen name changes a year. New names can
be suggested for almost any reason, but most usually they are
enacted to honor people or places or events that have had a
certain significance in the community. Thus, West 106th
Street is also Duke Ellington Boulevard, the Lincoln Center
complex contains a Richard Tucker Square and a block of
Christopher Street in lower Manhattan was recently renamed
Stonewall Place to mark the site of a landmark gay rights
uprising. Every New Yorker has heard of Bruckner Boulevard
and the Major Deegan Expressway, although few of them have
the foggiest idea who either man was. (Henry Bruckner was a
former congressman and Bronx borough president, who died in
1942; William F. Deegan was a former tenement house
commissioner.)
   Present practices are all very well and could of course
continue. But if a city is renaming its streets anyway, it
seems foolish to miss the opportunity to make money out of
it, with the contributions called for determined by the
prominence of the street, its location and the number of
blocks of it desired. Again for the small giver, there would
be the opportunity to participate through a suitably
inscribed memorial manhole cover.
   To be sure, there may be opposition to some name changes,
as there was when Sixth Avenue's name was switched to the
Avenue of the Americas. The Fifth Avenue Association, for
one, is not likely to be happy about the prospect of renaming
Fifth Avenue. But this is small-minded. Given the choice of
being hit with higher taxes to make up local government
deficits, or changing their stationery to read "Rockefeller
Road," "Annenberg Avenue," or "Sony Street," most New
Yorkers, like most Americans, would surely vote their pocket
books.

   It was with sadness that I read your "Chilling Tale" (page
one, May 7) about GE's disaster with the rotary compressor.
It's tragic that such a valiant effort to upgrade
manufacturing in the U.S. failed because of a layered
corporate structure that told the boss what he wanted to
hear.
   It also is astounding to learn that GE was the inventor of
the rotary compressor for appliances and in 1986 "designed a
revolutionary rotary compressor for refrigerators." When I
joined Frigidaire in 1955, it had been using the rotary
compressor exclusively in its "Fridges" for many, many years.
In 1967 we brought the new RI compressor into production
without a hiccup. This new unit had many technological
advances.

<TEXT>
   In those days, as today, it was customary for appliance
manufacturers to exchange factory visits. These exchanges of
ideas and technology have been a significant factor in
keeping America the world leader in major-appliance
manufacturing. Where else can you buy a 21-cubic-foot Frost
Proof Fridge for $687 when the first 1957 15-cubic-foot
models sold for $700?

   Thank you for the fine article on General Electric. Having
worked in both the refrigeration department and the corporate
manufacturing staff of GE, I can say you caught the flavor of
GE's operating style: Act as if there are no problems and do
not, above all, give the boss any bad news.
   This fiasco is, I am told by many GE graduates, a repeat
of a very similar problem in the early 1950s. The parts of

   We were surprised to read that in December 1987, Tecumseh
Products Co. "had quit" the domestic refrigeration-compressor
business. GE must have been equally surprised by this
statement as we were an on-line supplier of compressors to
its Decatur, Ala., plant at that time.
   Throughout our history, the G.E. Motor Group has been a
key vendor to Tecumseh Products and continues to supply us
with motors for all types of compressors. Tecumseh is alive,
well and working hard to satisfy industry demand for
energy-efficient compressors.

   The GE refrigerator-compressor fiasco is a symptom of Jack
Welch's management style. In the 27 years I worked at GE and
at the countless technical meetings I attended, there was no
mention of Reginald Jones or Ralph Cordiner when they were
GE's CEOs. Decisions were made on technical and economic
merits. Mr. Welch's name and his "vision" now predominate
meetings, as if he were the guru of turbine-generators. No
wonder the Louisville management did not have the courage to
confront Mr. Welch with any negative news.
   Mr. Welch's 1987 vision for Schenectady's
turbine-generator business was emphasis on customer service
while concurrently nuking the Turbine Technology Laboratory
and hundreds of experienced engineers. These were the
engineers and scientists who provided the product
reliability, engineering, quality control, research and
development, manufacturing support and true customer-service
support to the business. We are now working feverishly to
contain the damage caused by Mr. Welch's actions because no
manager had the courage to tell him that his vision for the
business was flawed.

   Powder metal is not a new material as you implied. Powder
metallurgy (P/M) parts have been used in appliances and
automobiles for more than 50 years. The average passenger car
contains about 21 pounds of P/M parts in critical
applications in the automatic transmission and engine, a
four-wheel-drive light truck about 30 pounds. Powder
metallurgy is probably one of the fastest-growing sectors
within the world-wide metalworking industry, because of
unique parts properties and production efficiencies.
   Our investigation of the circumstances surrounding the
design of the new compressor leads us to believe that the
real culprit was an unfortunate overall design and inadequate
field testing. We also have learned that the lubricant failed
at a low temperature, causing subsequent part failures. To
the best of our knowledge, the same compressor, used in air
conditioners, currently contains two powder metallurgy parts
that are performing without any problems.
   In the design and manufacture of any product, the proper
selection, specifying and testing of any material are
critical. In this particular application, an incorrect P/ M
material in combination with the wrong lubricant seems to
have caused the failure.

   ORLANDO, Fla. -- Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. named a
new chief financial officer and new presidents for three of
its publishing companies.
   Gary J. Arnold, senior vice president and secretary, said
the moves are designed to get a "new team in place" for John
S. Herrington, who was recently named chairman of the
publishing and insurance concern, and Peter Jovanovich, who
was recently named chairman of the board's executive
committee.

   Harcourt has been struggling under debt linked to its 1987
recapitalization. Along with the personnel changes, Harcourt
said, it is consolidating its corporate finance department
with its publishing finance department to cut costs.
   Robert E. Evanson, 53 years old, was named chief financial
officer. He succeeds John Berardi, who left the company to
pursue outside opportunities. Mr. Evanson most recently
directed Harcourt's university, professional and
international publishing.
   Marcus L. Boggs, 42, was named president of Harcourt's
Academic Press Inc., an international publisher of books and
scholarly journals for the natural, physical and social
sciences, filling a vacancy. Mr. Boggs had been executive
editor, humanities and social sciences, in Harcourt's college
department.
   Bill M. Barnett, 59, was named president of the college
division of Harcourt's subsidiary, Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston
Inc., in Fort Worth, Texas, succeeding David Dusthimer. Mr.
Barnett had been president of Harcourt's college department.
   Robert A. Pawlik, 49, was appointed president of
Harcourt's college department, based in San Diego, which
specializes in the fields of accounting, English, history,
political science, computer science, mathematics and social
sciences. Mr. Pawlik had been national sales manager in the
college department.
   Mr. Arnold, the senior vice president, said the company
doesn't anticipate any changes in management at its other
major publishing arm, the elementary and high-school textbook
division. That division has done poorly in the past 18
months, after failing to meet changing demands from
educators. Last year, Harcourt took an $88 million write-down
to cover obsolete inventory in the division.

   Mandela Legend Grows to Superhuman Proportions

   ANC Leader's Appeal is Grounded
   On Great Charisma, Unusual Stamina

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- Nelson Mandela has been
trying to climb down from the pedestal of his legend since
the moment he stepped out of prison in February. "I am no
prophet," he told reporters a few days after his release,
"and it is not at all correct to elevate a human being to the
position of a god."
   But, as he begins his first visit to the U.S. tomorrow,
Mr. Mandela's pedestal is, if anything, a bit higher.
Wherever the 71-year-old African National Congress leader
goes, barnstorming around the world in his campaign to keep
the pressure on the South African government, curious
multitudes strain to see, touch and hear him. He may not be a
god, but Nelson Mandela, blessed with a double-helping of
charisma, is certainly an extraordinary idol.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Traveling with Mandela," marvels Joe Slovo, an ANC
colleague, "is like traveling with Elvis."
   Since his release from 27 years in prison, Mr. Mandela has
covered more ground than the Pope, sweeping through Africa,
Europe and now North America. His travels have shown that he
is a human being after all. He gets tired often, suffers from
jet-lag and, during a recent pit-stop in Johannesburg, was
hospitalized for a week of rest and a minor bladder
operation. And, like all human beings, he has ruffled some
feathers. His embrace of Yasser Arafat, the Palestine
Liberation Organization chief, irked the world's Jewish
community; his tribute to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's
"commitment to human rights" raised eyebrows in the West; his
early talk of nationalization dismayed the business
community.
   Still, in the crucial battle for international acclaim
being waged by all sides in South Africa, the Mandela legend
-- the unbowed prisoner refusing to compromise his principles
-- prevails. While Mr. Mandela's presence is desperately
needed at home to calm the storms of changing South Africa,
the ANC also needs him abroad to counter Pretoria's recent
diplomatic offensive.
   Last month, South African President F.W. de Klerk traveled
through Europe and won high praise for his reforms, which
include releasing Mr. Mandela, unbanning the ANC and other
opposition groups, lifting much of the state of emergency and
moving toward negotiations on a new constitution based on
black-white power sharing. It was a triumphant tour for a
government so long shunned by the rest of the world, and Mr.
de Klerk returned home confident the Europeans were ready to
review their economic sanctions against South Africa.
   But Mr. de Klerk is no Elvis. Last week, Mr. Mandela
campaigned through Europe -- a mass rally here, tea with
royalty there -- and with his refrain, "I still have no
vote," effectively recaptured the ground Mr. de Klerk had
won. (Mr. de Klerk has decided not to challenge Mr. Mandela
in the U.S., postponing a visit once scheduled for this
month.) Mr. Mandela argues that to lift sanctions now, while
the essence of apartheid remains, would be like "a stab in
the back." And who, say his colleagues at the ANC, would do
such a thing to a man who has sacrificed three decades of his
life fighting for racial equality?
   "Mr. Mandela is a type of man one doesn't get very often,"
says Ahmed Kathrada, who was sentenced to life imprisonment
along with Mr. Mandela in 1964 and now is the ANC's publicity
director. "He's an exceptional leader, with ability,
charisma, courage and sacrifice."
   Despite the tremendous pressure on his tours -- in the
U.S., he will go from a ticker-tape parade to a meeting with
President Bush to a joint session of Congress to mass rallies
across the country -- Mr. Mandela is relaxed, as if he has
been shaking hands and kissing babies for the past 27 years
instead of sitting in jail. When he walks into a room, his
face lights up, offering winks and smiles to all those
present. In his speeches, one minute he may quote nursery
rhymes, the next Shakespeare. He has kind words for his
adversary, Mr. de Klerk, and even offers encouragement. He
shows no trace of bitterness.
   His trademark is a right fist raised over his head,
symbolizing the victories thus far of the anti-apartheid
forces. But on this trip, behind the scenes, his hand is
often open and outstretched, soliciting contributions for the
ANC's work in South Africa.
   At home, Mr. Mandela's colleagues are just as busy as he
is. "In jail at least we could get some sleep," says Walter
Sisulu, Mr. Mandela's 77-year-old colleague who was also
sentenced in 1964.
   Mr. Sisulu is heading the efforts to re-establish the ANC
as a legal political party inside South Africa, where it had
been banned for the past 30 years. To compete with the ruling
National Party, the ANC is scurrying to set up branch offices
across the country, establish a communications and publicity
network and begin grassroots canvassing.
   It isn't easy, says Mr. Sisulu. "I'm dissatisfied with our
progress," he admits. "We're not getting down to the masses."
   As a result, the ANC leadership finds itself reacting to
events more often than shaping them. There are repeated calls
to stop the violence in black townships, yet it goes on. The
students are told to go back to school to end the black
education crisis, but then the teachers go on strike over a
lack of books and overcrowded classrooms. The government is
pressing the ANC to come to consensus more quickly, so the
negotiation process can proceed.
   In addition, the released prisoners face the problem of
adjusting to the 1990s. The telephone in his office buzzes
and Mr. Sisulu fumbles to hit the right button. Mr. Kathrada,
who is 60, says he tried to use a cordless telephone at his
home and then in frustration unplugged it and put it in a
closet. He is still battling with his newfangled Gillette
razor, and still trying to solve the mysteries of his pager
and the office fax. He's leaving the computers to the younger
generation of ANC activitists.
   "When we went to prison, computers were the size of a
room," says Mr. Kathrada.
   In an odd way, though, both men say prison helped them and
Mr. Mandela prepare for their present hectic lives. For one
thing, they were able to exercise often; Mr. Mandela
exercised for two hours every day. For another, the prison
diet of porridge and meat kept them trim. "No junk food,"
says Mr. Kathrada. Then, too, in the last several years of
prison there was regular access to newspapers, and plenty of
time to read them.
   But nothing was able to prepare them for the sustained
reception following their release. "I thought that within two
or three weeks the euphoria would be over and we'd be able to
establish ourselves into some sort of normal routine," says
Mr. Kathrada.
   The others worry about Mr. Mandela's stamina and health,
and he worries about them. But after nearly three decades in
prison, none of them is going to slow down now.
   Mr. Kathrada laughs as he recalls flying to Cape Town with
Mr. Mandela on a jam-packed South African Airways plane. Both
of them were looking forward to two hours of quiet work in
preparation for a meeting later that day with Mr. de Klerk.
Shortly after takeoff, though, several children approached
Mr. Mandela for his autograph. He happily obliged, only to
find a line of children backing up through the plane.
   "Nelson had a chat with each child," says Mr. Kathrada. "I
was trying to tell him, `Just sign your name,' but he wasn't
satisfied with that. He had to write a little message,
including the name of the child." It went on like this until
20 minutes before landing when the pilot invited Mr. Mandela
into the cockpit.
   Mr. Kathrada rolls his eyes. They never did get to their
work.

   Among the many commencement ceremonies Hodding Carter III
has attended ("Commencement Speaking: Bloviating to the Bored
and Boorish," Viewpoint, May 10), mine was not one of them.
This is too bad for Mr. Carter, for if he had, his cynicism
might be tempered just a bit.
   I graduated in May 1982 from Gonzaga University, a small
Jesuit university in Spokane, Wash. The commencement address
was given by William Bennett, then chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities. His address was a typical
Bennett performance; very straightforward and to the point.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The point was common-sense advice on how to approach your
first job. The overall theme was plunge yourself into your
work, get to know every aspect of your job, get excited about
even the most mundane tasks, and become a true asset to your
company. It is based on the belief that good things happen to
people who work hard for the sake of a company. This was
well-timed advice that I've tried to follow throughout my
career.
   To Mr. Bennett's credit, he did not use the event as a
platform to announce a new policy or political opinion. But
rather, he used it simply to address the graduates. Perhaps
if more speakers followed William Bennett's role, Hodding
Carter would be less apt to scrap the entire tradition.

   TORONTO -- Inco Ltd. said its Indonesian subsidiary
expects to pay total dividends this year of about $125
million, or 50 cents a share, assuming nickel prices remain
around their current levels.
   It would be the first dividend payment by P.T.
International Nickel Indonesia after a recent offering to the
public of 20% of the company's shares. However, the dividend
forecast is below that projected in the offering prospectus
in April.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Inco, the Western world's largest nickel
producer, said the parent company would be entitled to
receive 58% of the dividend, based upon its equity holding.
He said the bulk of the P.T. Inco payment would be made as an
interim dividend in October.
   Inco also has received proceeds of $240 million from the
P.T. Inco share offering, which it expects to result in a
second-quarter gain for Inco of $125 million. Another 20% of
P.T. Inco is owned by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. of Japan,
with the remaining 2% held by various Japanese interests.
   In April, P.T. Inco said it expected to pay dividends for
1990 of $160 million, or 64 cents a share, and said it
expected net income this year of $110 million. It didn't make
a new earnings forecast.
   Since then, P.T. Inco has lowered its 1990 production
estimate to 70 million pounds from 80 million pounds of
nickel matte, which contains about 80% nickel, because of
various operating problems. It also lowered its expectations
for nickel prices.
   Inco said the average cash nickel price on the London
Metal Exchange for the first five months of 1990 was $3.72 a
pound, compared with an average of $5.82 a pound for all of
1989.
   It said every $1 change in the exchange's average price
for a year alters P.T. Inco's earnings by $50 million, or 20
cents a share, and its dividend payments by $60 million, or
25 cents a share.
   Last year, P.T. Inco had earnings of $182 million, or 74
cents a share, on revenue of $305 million.

   Prudential-Bache
   Canada Unit Plans
   To Sell Retail Line

   TORONTO -- Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd. said it
agreed to sell its retail brokerage business to Burns Fry
Ltd., becoming the second U.S.-owned investment dealer this
year to retreat from the Canadian securities market.
   The Canadian unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America
said it expects to shift most of its other Canadian
operations, including its corporate finance, institutional
sales and capital markets divisions, to New York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Forecasts showed us that the retail business {in Canada}
will not become robust until at least this time next year,"
said George McGough, president and chief executive of
Prudential-Bache Canada. Terms of the sale to Burns Fry
weren't disclosed.
   In the three years that Prudential-Bache Canada has
operated as a full-service broker, it hasn't reported a
profit. Exact losses haven't been disclosed but a company
executive said that even if retail activity picked up next
year, it would take until the end of 1992 for the company to
make "a real profit."
   Mr. McGough said no decisions have been made on the future
of the Canadian unit, which will retain only about 35 of its
700 employees.
   About 400 of the employees will be offered positions with
Burns Fry, all of them retail brokers and support staff.
About 200 others will be laid off. Burns Fry executives said
they will interview some Prudential-Bache Canada traders and
research analysts for other positions.
   In January, Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., then the largest
U.S. investment dealer in Canada, agreed to sell its retail
brokerage operations to Toronto-based Wood Gundy Inc. for an
undisclosed sum, citing the closer links between banks and
brokerage firms as a reason for their move.
   Prudential-Bache Canada executives didn't liken their
decision to that of Merrill Lynch Canada, a unit of Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. "This was a purely business move," Mr. McGough
said.
   Canada's retail brokerage business still hasn't recovered
from the 1987 stock market crash. Only one-third of Toronto
Stock Exchange member firms reported profits for the first
quarter of 1990, the exchange said last week.
   Michael Fusco, president of Dean Witter Reynolds Canada
Inc., now the only U.S. securities firm offering retail
services in Canada, said he sees Canada as continuing to
offer many opportunities for companies with a clear strategic
focus.
   "We're purely and simply a retail firm, with only a small
involvement in capital markets and other areas," Mr. Fusco
said. He declined to say whether Dean Witter Canada, which
also has reported losses, will show a profit this year. But
he said the firm's results to date are "on plan." Dean Witter
is a unit of Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.
   Burns Fry executives said they aren't worried about the
effects of the current slump on retail brokers. "In five to
10 years, there is no area of the industry that should grow
faster than individual-client services," said Terry Cooper,
executive vice president of the Toronto-based investment
dealer.
   The Prudential-Bache transaction will put Burns Fry, which
is 30%-owned by Security Pacific Corp. of Seattle, into the
ranks of Canada's largest retail investment dealers. Burns
Fry said it will have at least 1,900 employees, including 500
retail brokers, following the acquisition of Prudential-Bache
Canada's operations.
   In New York, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Chairman
George Ball told employees in an internal memo that the
firm's revenue, based on first-quarter results, project to
$1.27 billion for 1990, 11% above 1989 revenue of $1.14
billion, when the firm sustained a net loss of about $51
million.
   Revenues are rising partly because of an influx of brokers
after Prudential-Bache's takeover of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc.'s brokerage network last summer. However,
revenue per broker is down from $223,986 last year to a pace
of $202,232 for 1990, apparently reflecting lower production
from the McKinnon brokers, the memo states.

   They Better Send In the Clowns,

   If Mikhail Gorbachev thinks he's on a tightrope trying to
keep the Soviet Union together, he should try uniting the
Great Circus BimBom From Russia.
   About 10 of the Soviet circus's aerialists, known as the
Flying Stankeevs, are in Las Vegas, Nev., at the Landmark
Hotel. Thirty-plus acrobats are fishing and swimming at a
West Virginia ski resort, while more than 60 illusionists and
musicians are holed up at an Atlanta Travelodge motel.
Meanwhile, the circus's 13 horses, 12 soccer-playing Boxer
dogs, five bears, five chimps, three lions and a cart-pulling
goose are in New York.

   The supposed two-year U.S. goodwill tour fell apart in
April, when Kuwaiti financial backers did a disappearing act
following an opening performance in Hershey, Pa. It's been a
zoo ever since.
   Unpaid bus drivers and truckers quit but kept equipment as
ransom. The broke BimBom was evicted from a handful of
motels. And now promoters and Americans who have befriended
the troupe can't agree on getting the show on the road.
   Andrew Truman, a circus tour director, says a two-year
contract has been lined up in Las Vegas, which is why the
aerialists are there. But Laurie McLeod, a circus truck
driver in Atlanta, where the group split up, says the
performers there, who are wary about the Las Vegas
arrangements, are adamant about not going to Nevada. Instead,
they're trying to work out a contract, possibly in Kentucky.
   Mr. Truman says the Atlanta contingent has no choice:
"It's Vegas or Moscow." He says the circus's Russian sponsor,
who controls the terms of the troupe's American stay, has an
agreement with Nevada investors to begin performances in
July, albeit under a different name: the Great Russian
Circus. Evidently the Nevada investors decided to drop BimBom
-- the name of a Russian entertainer -- after clowning radio
stations called it the Bimbo circus.
   Meanwhile, the West Virginia performers have been told
nearly daily by the Nevada group to have their bags packed
for Las Vegas.
   "They were supposed to leave on four different occasions.
Something always comes up," says Steven Drumheller, marketing
director for the Silver Creek Ski Resort, who heard of their
plight and invited circus members to West Virginia.
   He doesn't mind, he says, but the lodge is running out of
donated food. And feeding people nicknamed "Grizzly" costs
more than peanuts.

   TORONTO -- "We've never had any cash," says Corona Corp.'s
Ned Goodman. "When you get into a situation where your
opposition is dealing with cash, you've got to become more
creative."
   Creative financing is the Corona chairman's hallmark.
Mainly by issuing new securities and trading them for assets,
he has built Toronto-based Corona into one of North America's
10 biggest gold mining companies. Through a special class of
shares, he and a few friends have solid control with only
7.6% of the equity. His penchant for complex deals and
ultimate control has given rise to what analysts call the
"Ned Factor," a sort of bewilderment discount that they say
sometimes affects the share prices of his companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite this, Corona shareholders have done better over
the years than those of most other Canadian gold companies.
   Now Mr. Goodman, 52 years old, has proposed a typically
complex series of transactions, entirely paid for with paper,
that could win Corona control of two companies that own
Canada's hottest new gold property. The Eskay Creek property
in British Columbia has estimated reserves of 4.8 million
ounces, worth about US$1.66 billion at current prices.
   But Corona, and Mr. Goodman's paper-shuffling style, are
challenged by a 230 million Canadian dollar (US$196 million),
all-cash offer by Placer Dome Inc. for one of the target
companies, Stikine Resources Ltd. Most analysts agree that
Mr. Goodman's paper probably has more long-term value than
Placer Dome's cash, and Corona also has locked up a huge
block of shares in Stikine. But recent declines in the price
of gold, along with the Ned Factor, have pushed down the
price of Corona's shares and, therefore, the value of its
planned offer. The contest won't be over until Vancouver,
British Columbia-based Placer Dome's bid expires today.
   Mr. Goodman's style has deep roots. Born in Montreal, he
was trained as a geologist and later moved into investment
counseling. He became involved with a sleepy copper producer
called Campbell Chibougamau Mines Ltd. After a 1979 proxy
fight, Mr. Goodman took over as chairman and went on a
shopping binge in the resource sector.
   By 1985, Campbell had run up lots of debt, and Mr. Goodman
was outnumbered when the board decided to sell the company's
interest in Royex Gold Mining Corp. He quit the Campbell
board and bought the Royex stake in a transaction that even
Mr. Goodman says was complex.
   "I said that I'd never put myself in a position again of
working for a company where someone else is going to make the
decisions," Mr. Goodman says.
   Royex's main asset was its holding in International Corona
Resources Ltd., which in turn held a controlling stake in
Royex. Over the next three years, Royex acquired major
interests in other resource outfits, financing the deals in
part by transferring investments between units.
   "We were getting an awful lot of criticism because we had
a complicated company. I didn't like it either. (But) we had
no choice," Mr. Goodman says. To simplify matters, he merged
Royex with four related companies to form Corona in 1988.
   In his latest proposal, Mr. Goodman plans to spin off
Corona's gold assets into a separately listed company. Some
shares of the new company, to be called Corona Gold Corp.,
will be distributed to current Corona holders. He also has
offered a combination of Corona and Corona Gold shares to the
owners of Eskay Creek, Stikine and Prime Resources Group
Inc., which would then be merged with Corona Gold.
   Mr. Goodman says the Corona restructuring, which would
leave the parent holding a mixed basket of resource
interests, is meant to still the "moans and groans" of
holders who disapproved of the company's branching out from
precious metals.
   But the restructuring plan hasn't satisfied all of Mr.
Goodman's critics, who complain that he freely spends
Corona's Class A shares, which carry one vote apiece, while
leaving intact the number of Class B shares, which have 100
votes apiece and are largely held by Mr. Goodman and four
other directors.
   A study of Corona's past share price performance indicates
that backing Mr. Goodman has been wise. Barry Allan, an
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd.,
calculates that an investor buying a Royex share in January
1987, when Mr. Goodman became Royex's chairman, would have
seen a 3.4% appreciation in his money. This compares with a
9.9% drop in the Toronto Stock Exchange gold index over the
same period and a decline of 15% in the price of gold
bullion.
   Nevertheless, "there are a lot of people who don't want to
have anything to do with the guy (Mr. Goodman). I sometimes
wonder whether people are afraid of him because he's two
steps ahead of them," says John Embry, a vice president of
Toronto-based Royal Bank Investment Management, which holds
about 4% of the Corona Class A shares.
   Although he backs Mr. Goodman's proposals to acquire Eskay
Creek and restructure Corona, Mr. Embry says he remains
concerned Corona will continue to control the new gold unit
with a 50.2% holding.
   Mr. Goodman plans to remain at the helm of the Corona
parent, which will concentrate on building up its interests
in base metals, oil and gas, industrial minerals and
financial services. Meantime, Corona Gold, if it succeeds in
its plan to merge with the current owners of Eskay Creek,
will focus on developing that ore body. Mr. Goodman estimates
the addition of Eskay Creek would boost Corona's production
to about 1.2 million ounces of gold in 1994 from 700,000
ounces expected this year.

   That (Non-)Problem, the Budget Deficit

   The furor raging in Washington over the federal budget
deficit is good for scare headlines and political
sloganeering. But the budget summit in which President Bush
is now participating has nothing to do with economic reality.
It offers no proper justification for raising taxes or, for
that matter, cutting spending, to reduce the deficit.
   One reason the matter is urgent, we are told, is that the
need to bail out the Savings and Loans is making the deficit
worse. The S&amp;Ls may well have made some bad loans and
financed private spending that was not worthwhile. Or they
may have made long-term loans at rates of interest that have
turned out to be too low. In either event the market value of
their assets is insufficient to pay off their depositors and
other creditors. But all that is water over the dam, or more
accurately, money down the drain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If $180 billion of currency were to get washed away in the
sewage system -- or burned in a fire -- we would not think of
raising taxes to reimburse the losers. At that point it is
purely a paper matter. We would authorize the printing of
more money. That would in no way be inflationary; we would
merely be replacing the money that had been destroyed.
   Failing to replace that money would, to the contrary, be
most deflationary. It would almost certainly bring on a
financial crisis and very likely a sharp recession. And
taxing the public to get the money to reimburse the losers
would only compound the problem; the wealth of money-losers
would be restored at the expense of the rest of us.
   Yet this is exactly the situation with the S&amp;Ls. The
bailouts do not add to the money of depositors. They merely
keep them from losing their money -- that is, prevent the
quantity of money from being reduced. By keeping their
depositors and other creditors whole we are preventing cash
and other financial assets from going down the drain.
Refinancing or replacing those collapsing financial assets
does not add to the nation's spending or spending power.
   The government is not commanding new resources, as it
would when it builds missiles or roads. This is rather a
financial operation, like the pouring in of reserves and
liquidity to the banking system that Alan Greenspan and the
Fed undertook to stop the stock market crash of October 1987;
it may merely entail more, and more long-term, financial
intervention. Raising taxes to pay for this now is no more in
order than it would have been to bail out stock dealers
caught in the financial squeeze then.
   It may be pointed out that loan guarantees or deposit
insurance indirectly finance real spending just as they might
if treasury expenditures were made up front. In a sense, the
explicit and implicit deposit insurance or guarantees raised
the budget deficit at the time the S&amp;Ls made the loans that
ultimately turned bad. There might have been budget footnotes
over these past years mentioning these additional
expenditures and offering a measure of "the deficit"
including them.
   But the fact is the expenditures were made then. They then
financed the now half-empty office buildings or homes worth
only a fraction of their construction costs. Current
government borrowing to finance the purchase of S&amp;L assets
only makes explicit an element of deficit or debt that was
implicit earlier in the commitment of backing to S&amp;L
liabilities -- the deposits or money of S&amp;L creditors.
Whatever problems of fairness and equity it may impose, and
whatever may be indicated in the way of new arrangements to
prevent bad private loan practices in the future, the S&amp;L
bailout has nothing to do with the current budget deficit.
   Regarding the current deficit, and deficits more
generally, the simple fact is that deficits add to debt. They
do so for an individual or a business. They do so for
governments. The question for all is how fast debt is growing
and for what purpose.
   In a growing economy with more people and more product and
income, debt generally grows. It has in fact been growing
very rapidly for the private sector. One sensible first rule
of thumb is to keep that growth balanced -- that is, to keep
debt growing no faster than income.
   For the federal government that means keeping the debt
from growing faster than the national income, or gross
national product. This would keep the ratio of debt to
income, currently about 42% or three-sevenths, constant. That
ratio has of course been lower but it has also been much
higher, well over 100% just after World War II, with no
disastrous consequences. And it is not particularly high
compared to other countries.
   But the national income and GNP are growing at just about
7% per year. Maintaining a constant debt-GNP ratio would thus
require that the debt grow at 7% a year. With a federal debt
held by the public approaching $2.3 trillion (and a GNP
around $5.5 trillion) that implies an increase in the debt of
$161 billion.
   The deficit, assets sales and accounting gimmicks aside,
is exactly equal to the increase in the debt. We would keep
our debt in line with our income then by running a deficit of
$161 billion -- or 3% of GNP -- which is a bit more than the
deficit we have been running and is not exceeded by even more
alarmist projections of the deficit. In a meaningful economic
sense, not the sense of Gramm-Rudman, the federal budget is
now in balance, precisely the kind of balance that would be
welcomed by any business trying to travel a road of balanced
growth.
   The really serious problem is not now the size of the
government deficit but, as with most individuals or
businesses, what the borrowing is being used to finance. If
an individual borrows to finance gambling losses in Las Vegas
that is clearly bad. If a family borrows to invest in a new
home or the children's college education, most of us think
that is good. And if business borrows to invest in productive
new plant and equipment, not many of us would be critical.
   It should be the same for government at all levels. It is
past time for Mr. Bush and Congress to put behind foolish
posturing over mismeasured deficits and to face up to our
real needs. These are to assure a prosperous economy now and
the real investment, public and private, on which our
prosperity depends.

   U.S. Call to Open Japan Trade Market
   May Bring Crackdown on Foreign Firms

   TOKYO -- Some Americans fear that Japan won't live up to
promises it has made in trade talks. Others fear that it
will.
   The U.S., in negotiations slated to end by early next
month, is pushing Japan to better arm its relatively weak
trustbusters, hoping to smash collusive practices that
allegedly block newcomers from the Japanese market. The good
news is that Japan's Fair Trade Commission is cracking more
heads. The bad news is that foreign firms are prime targets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On June 11, the trade commission issued a report on some
large gaps in prices among Tokyo, New York, London, Paris and
Frankfurt that concluded that U.S. and European importers and
their agents are keeping prices up and forcing their Japanese
retailers to do the same. The commission said it will use the
report to issue new guidelines and will "deal strictly" with
abuses discovered.
   This month, the commission raided 14 Japanese offices of
Master Foods K.K., a subsidiary of Mars Inc., McLean, Va. The
Japanese government is investigating charges that the U.S.
firm threatened to cut off supplies of pet food to retailers
and wholesalers offering discounts. Master Foods, in a letter
to its distributors, denied the charges.
   Last October, the trade commission searched the files of
Apple Computer Co. and its Japanese distributor, Canon Sales
Co., amid allegations there had been pressure put on four
computer magazines to suspend ads from independent importers
selling PCs at a discount. The case is still under
investigation, and Apple has denied the charges.
   Some Americans think the moves are intentional. "There's
very definitely a tribal mentality," says William Best,
director of the Tokyo office of A.T. Kearney International
Inc., a U.S. consulting company. "There's still very much an
interest in trying to place the blame on the outsider."
   "There's nothing like that," counters Tsutomu Yamada,
deputy director of the Fair Trade Commission's general
affairs division. He says the commission is conducting more
investigations in general and that "just by chance" some
foreign firms get caught in the dragnet. Most of the
commission's investigations aren't publicized, and Mr. Yamada
declined to say what percentage involve foreign-based
companies.
   In the year ended March 31, the commission handled 270
cases, 50% more than the year before. Three days after the
Master Foods case, the group launched a potentially
far-reaching investigation into Japan's cement industry for
allegedly setting up an illegal cartel. Also, as part of its
U.S.-instigated reforms, the commission is setting up a
special section to handle complaints from foreign firms.
   On the books, Japan's antitrust laws are officially the
same as in the U.S., but the application is different. From
1985 to 1988, according to a U.S. Justice Department study,
the U.S. government found fault in 30% of the cases it
investigated, while the Japanese government took action in
only 5% of its cases. The average fine in the U.S. was eight
times as large as in Japan.
   Japan's relatively lax antitrust enforcement is one of
several issues under discussion in the Structural Impediments
Initiative, the term given to current bilateral negotiations
on how to trim the $49 billion U.S.-Japanese trade imbalance.
   A fundamental U.S. philosophy in the talks is that prices
are higher in Japan than in the rest of the industrialized
world. In the U.S. view, this proves that Japan's is
essentially a less competitive market.
   The Japanese, however, are increasingly sensitive to
assertions they are anything but a normal free-market
economy. Last September, shortly after the talks began, the
Japanese government produced a study concluding that prices
were higher in the U.S. than in Japan. The U.S. poked holes
in the methodology, and the two sides did a joint study.
Two-thirds of the 122 goods examined cost more in Japan. Of
those, half cost 50% more.
   In January, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry released its own study, which concluded that the
average profit-to-sales ratio of foreign companies in Japan
in 1988 was 6.8%, compared with 2.8% for Japanese firms.
   Some foreign government and business officials concede
that they use higher markups in Japan. In Japan,
"distributors, dealers, shops have always said that if an
imported product is the same price as Japanese products, it
will not sell," says Luciano Cohen, chairman of the Council
of the European Business Community in Japan. "They tell you
the price should be higher if you want to sell it."
   U.S. officials complain that the Japanese reports are
distorted, focusing on an unrepresentative sampling of
foreign companies, mainly importers of name brands and luxury
goods.

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- As the Excalibur hotel-casino lowers
its drawbridge to the public for the first time today,
executives are hoping a horde of 50,000 or so will storm its
battlements.
   With 4,032 rooms, the hotel is the biggest ever built,
with a casino the size of four football fields and the
world's largest restaurant to boot.

<TEXT>
   How does Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., the Excalibur's
owner, plan to upstage the premiere of the Mirage just up the
Strip, when prize fights and celebrities galore introduced
gamblers to a towering man-made volcano and white tigers? Or
the opening of Donald Trump's billion-dollar Taj Mahal in
Atlantic City?
   "We'll just open the doors and let 'em in," says Glenn
Schaeffer, Circus's chief financial officer. "They won't come
to hear the speeches."
   That understated approach reflects the success of a
company that has made its mark by catering to the family
market in Las Vegas, targeting relatively low-rollers. And
unlike Donald Trump or the Mirage's Steve Wynn, William
Bennett, the Excalibur's mastermind and the chairman of
Circus Circus, is unlikely to be recognized by the casino's
clients.
   Circus's reputation rides on the performance of the $290
million Excalibur. Wall Street has run up the company's stock
about 23% since March on the widespread expectation that the
new casino will pay off big. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Circus shares closed unchanged
at $61.25.
   While some competitors must generate more than $1 million
a day to break even, Excalibur's $200,000 break-even point is
designed to produce steady cash flow almost immediately, Mr.
Schaeffer says.
   But even though the keep-it-simple approach of today's
opening cuts down on complications -- and eliminates millions
of dollars of the "complimentaries" other casinos lavish on
high rollers -- Excalibur's launch is a huge undertaking even
for the most experienced managers.
   Circus executives spent months troubleshooting everything
from the electrical and computer systems to the rolls of
quarters for the casino. Excalibur requires a cast of 4,400
employees, including jousting "knights" for two nightly
dinner shows -- not to mention a stable of horses. It has
2,600 slot machines, 100 table games, 12 restaurants and
retail stores, a "medieval" village with carnival-style
games, two motion-simulation theaters, crafts and strolling
entertainers.
   On the eve of the grand opening, Circus executives were
still troubleshooting.
   Over the weekend, the whine of sanders meshed with
piped-in chamber music as construction workers, managers,
casino staffers and others hustled to finish last-minute
touch-ups. In the porte-cochere, workers refinished walls
with ersatz stonework and hung banners to make the area look
less austere. "It looked fine on paper, but it just didn't
bring the castle experience to the front door," Richard P.
Banis, Circus's president, says as he surveys some 11th-hour
remodeling.
   Inside the four-level megacasino, a few evenings of
practice runs unearthed a rash of last-minute glitches. "You
never know how these things are going to run until you fill
them up," says Bill Paulos, Excalibur's general manager,
shortly after emerging from an hours-long meeting spent
analyzing the previous night's dry run. Once a casino opens,
he notes, it stays open indefinitely, 24 hours a day, with no
down time for repairs outside the public's sight.
   Minor problems pop up. Keys don't fit properly in doors,
which could send scads of guests back down to the front desk
as hundreds of others are trying to check in. A retail
point-of-purchase system goes haywire, victim of a damaged
wire. Doors open the wrong way. "Those things we can fix
pretty easily," Mr. Paulos says.
   But king-sized openings invite king-sized problems.
   At the Taj Mahal's opening in April, the torrent of coins
coursing through the casino literally broke the bank,
triggering a modified meltdown of the slot-accounting system
that left rows of machines shut down for weeks. The count
rooms, where the coins are tallied and stored, were bursting
at the seams. Balky machines gobbled up gamblers' currency,
then refused to spit out coins in exchange.
   At the Mirage, the glitches were less visible to the
public and thus less disruptive. But within 15 minutes of the
ribbon cutting in November, security guards had to swoop in
to control traffic at the doors because tens of thousands had
already packed the entire floor. Gamblers bought up so much
coin so quickly that the casino was caught short. The
computerized bar system went on the blink.
   Circus executives say they've learned from their own and
others' experiences that deciding what to leave out can be
almost as important as what is included in a new project. Mr.
Paulos says the company is staying away from new, untested
machines, such as change counters and computerized restaurant
order systems. Instead of relying on technology to handle the
huge demand for change at the opening, Excalibur is using a
fleet of armored trucks to help sell change out in the
parking lots.
   Although Excalibur is a step up from Circus' other themed
properties, it's not too big a step. Room service, for
example, is limited. Circus executives know that its
customers don't expect caviar, lavish suites or huge lines of
credit in exchange for an average $45 room rate and a meal
ticket of less than $5. "Eating in the rooms isn't part of
what we're doing here," Mr. Schaeffer says.
   So far, the formula has worked. With Excalibur's opening,
Circus Circus will operate roughly 10,200 Nevada hotel rooms
and about 435,000 square feet of casino space. The company
has scratched its way to the industry's top ranks by
producing hefty profit margins, strong earnings, return on
equity and steady expansion that make it the envy of
competitors. For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 1990, Circus
reported net income of $75 million, or $2.60 a share, on
revenue of $522.4 million.
   Like many analysts, Circus's competitors also expect the
Excalibur to do well. Steve Wynn, chairman of Golden Nugget,
owner of the Mirage, sees success for the new venture. Mr.
Bennett, Circus's chairman, has "a terrific feel for the K
mart end of the business," says Mr. Wynn.
   Mr. Bennett says he thinks Excalibur may increase Las
Vegas's visitor count by perhaps 5%. Although the company is
already looking to the future, Mr. Bennett says Circus is at
least two years away from "anything that requires a lot of
cash," such as a new project. In that time, Excalibur may
help Circus slash its $500 million in debt in half. But for
today, all eyes are on the castle.
   "The good news is that it should be a real success," says
John Rohs, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., who has
upped his earnings estimates for Circus. But Excalibur "could
have a more pronounced impact on Circus Circus Las Vegas,"
possibly drawing patrons from the company's huge
circus-themed property a few miles up the Strip.
   One thing that the best plans can't eliminate are
last-minute anxiety attacks. Mr. Banis confesses somewhat
sheepishly that he has had nightmares. "You know," he says,
"what if you throw a party and no one comes?"

   Earth First] Group
   Manages to Offend
   Nearly Everybody

   Militant Environmentalists
   Are Either Perpetrators
   Or Victims of a Bombing

   OAKLAND, Calif. -- To the genteel American conservation
movement, Earth First] is a burden and an embarrassment.
   The Sierra Club and National Wildlife Federation have
denounced its members as the moral equivalent of outlaws. A
former U.S. interior secretary has described the organizaton
as "a bunch of kooks." By police reckoning it is an extremist
and even violent group whose idea of saving the planet
includes spiking trees to make logging hazardous, and
destroying power lines and road-building equipment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But would the group go as far as to plant bombs? The
Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law-enforcement
authorities are expected to offer their views about this
question on Friday, when they give the results of an
investigation of a pipe-bomb explosion that injured two Earth
First] members here last month. The question: Did someone try
to kill them, or are they merely incompetent bomb makers?
   The investigation has put the controversial organization
into the limelight. Earth First] claims to be a kind of
confederacy of perhaps 5,000 "eco-warriors." Its founding was
inspired 10 years ago by the late Edward Abbey's novel "The
Monkey Wrench Gang." The 1975 book romanticized
environmentalists who fictionally liberated the deserts by
destroying billboards, roads and bulldozers while plotting to
free the Colorado River by blowing up the Glen Canyon Dam. In
1981, Earth First] draped a 300-foot banner, painted to
resemble a crack, over the dam. The authorities weren't
amused.
   In 1983, Dave Foreman, an Earth First] founder, lay on a
logging road in Oregon and wouldn't yield to a pickup driven
by a lumberjack. The driver kept going, and dragged Mr.
Foreman, clutching the pickup's front bumper, for a hundred
yards. Within the past year, Earth Firsters have chained
themselves to road-building machinery in Arizona to block a
telescope project that endangers a rare mountain squirrel,
created "human blockades" of logging roads in Australia, and
sat for days in the tops of Northern California redwood trees
attempting to keep them from being felled.
   In Arizona, federal authorities last year arrested three
Earth First] activists, charging that they had used cutting
torches to destroy power lines in a field test of a grander
scheme aimed at disabling nuclear power plants in Arizona and
California. Mr. Foreman, though he wasn't arrested at the
scene, was charged with conspiracy for allegedly helping plan
the scheme. All have denied the charges and rejected
government offers to plea-bargain.
   Earth First] insists that it is peaceful. "We believe in
confrontation, yes, but violence, no," says Mike Roselle, a
founder. He says Earth First] people are the targets, not the
instigators, of violence.
   Indeed, the car bombing on May 24 injured two Earth First]
leaders -- Judi Bari, a 40-year-old mother of two, and Darryl
Cherney, a 33-year-old musician. They were driving through a
quiet Oakland neighborhood when a pipe bomb in the backseat
of Ms. Bari's Subaru exploded.
   She was seriously injured; Mr. Cherney suffered a gash
over the eye. Oakland police, however, whisked the two into
custody -- Ms. Bari to the hospital, where she is recovering,
Mr. Cherney into jail -- on suspicion of transporting the
bomb for some terrorist purpose. After a flurry of statements
indicating the two would quickly be charged, police backed
down and asked for more time. Mr. Cherney was released from
jail.
   The activists insist they were targeted for death, perhaps
by greedy timber or other commercial interests, or by
right-wing off-road-vehicle ideologues angry over Earth
First] efforts to keep vehicles out of Western deserts. They
say that in recent months they have received at least 50
death threats.
   On Friday, the FBI and other authorities are scheduled to
put up or shut up. They are to announce the results of their
investigation, dealing among other things with whether the
pair was involved in the bombing of a Cloverdale, Calif.,
sawmill in early May.
   The evidence already disclosed in the Oakland car bombing
seems circumstancial, if damaging: The bomb appears to have
been lying unconcealed on the car seat when it exploded, for
example, and nails used to assemble it seem similar to nails
found elsewhere in the car.
   "Ridiculous]" Mr. Cherney says of the authorities'
suspicions. "We were a band on the way to a gig." A former
English teacher in Brooklyn as well as a musician, he manages
a grim joke: "We now call ourselves the Exploding Subarus."
But he adds in deadly seriousness: "Somebody tried to kill
us."
   Their friends and supporters shudder to think otherwise.
"If they {Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari} did this, it's all over,"
says a friend of Ms. Bari. "It will be devastating to the
cause."
   Many of the death threats appear related to Earth First]
efforts to organize a summer-long demonstration against
Northern California timber companies that are clear-cutting
the last of the state's privately owned virgin redwood
forests. The protest has stirred deep hostility in the
redwood corridors of Mendocino and Humboldt Counties. The two
activists have said that when the bomb exploded they were
headed for a musical fund-raiser -- he is a vocalist and
guitarist, she a fiddler -- for their "Redwood Summer"
project.
   With help from another militant environmental group,
Greenpeace, Earth First] has hired a detective to investigate
the bombing. Earth First] has a list of suspects, including
disgruntled loggers and the police themselves. Another is the
"Committee for the Death of Earth First," which is the
signature on recent anonymous letters threatening to "hunt
down" Earth First] women.
   The FBI still considers Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari as
suspects. But, says Duke Diedrich, a spokesman for the bureau
in San Francisco, "We haven't ruled out any possibility and
our investigation is very widespread."
   Earth First] has no faith in the bureau. Mr. Foreman has
obtained FBI wiretap transcripts in which an undercover agent
is heard telling other agents that the real importance of
arresting Mr. Foreman is "to send a message" to militant
environmentalists, adding, "That's all we're really doing."
Later, realizing his microphone is still on, the agent says,
"We don't need that on tape. Hoo boy]"
   While the FBI denies trying to unfairly discredit Earth
First], Mr. Foreman's lawyer, Garry Spence (who also
represents Imelda Marcos in her federal racketeering trial)
promises to make the agent's "message" the central issue in
Mr. Foreman's trial on charges of destroying power lines,
scheduled for September.
   Friends of Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari say they can't believe
that either is capable of building or exploding a bomb.
   Mr. Cherney says his childhood friends know he was
something of a "chicken," deathly afraid of firecrackers.
Friends describe Ms. Bari, who couldn't be interviewed in the
hospital for this story, as a union organizer and
"hell-raiser," but one with a self-deprecating sense of humor
whose credo is nonviolence. Oakland police have produced a
photograph of her with a submachine gun, but Mr. Cherney says
it was taken as a prank for the cover of a satirical record
album she and he recorded some time ago. It was titled, "They
Don't Make Hippies Like They Used To."
   Mr. Cherney says Earth First] often lands in trouble
because it uses hyperbole and satire as a weapon and a
catharsis. To write of pouring sand in the gasoline tank of a
bulldozer, he says, isn't the same as doing it -- even though
it still pleases the writer and offends the authorities, he
says.
   Some think this philosophy explains statements by Ms.
Bari, who last March joined other Earth First] members in
Ukiah, Calif., in slipping past crowds to hang a sign on a
huge mechanical logger that read: "This Thing Kills Jobs and
Forests." A few weeks later, the machine was destroyed by a
mysterious fire. Ms. Bari told the Earth First] Journal, the
organization's newsletter: "Either this thing is a $700,000
lemon, or there are some heroic people out there in the
woods."
   Did Ms. Bari have anything to do with the fire? "It wasn't
me," she said. "I was home in bed with five witnesses."

   Urged to Stick
   To Commodities

   LONDON -- African nations should concentrate on production
of commodities rather than industrialize, a United Nations
study said.
   Reversing previous policy recommendations that advised
stricken African countries to reduce their dependence on
commodities, the report said it would cost billions of
dollars and be "extremely difficult" for the countries to
diversify into manufacturing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We studied the problem for a year, and despite world
commodity price trends there just isn't any alternative,"
said Malcolm Fraser, a former Australian prime minister who
chaired the UN Secretary-General's Expert Group on African
Commodities.
   The study said African nations "must use commodity
production and trade as a motor for expansion." Commodity
production and distribution should be privatized or
decentralized, it said, adding that local and foreign
investment would improve transport, storage, agricultural
research and education facilities.
   Producers would help counter commodity gluts by allowing
local prices to fluctuate in line with international quotes
and by cooperating with other African nations and consumers,
the report said. Meanwhile, the U.S. and European countries
should reduce barriers to African produce, Mr. Fraser added.
   Africa's population will grow to about 740 million in 10
years from 550 million at present, the report said. Yet debts
have surged to about $220 billion from $108 billion in 1980
and economic growth has fallen. Africa is more dependent on
commodities as export income than any other region, the
report said, and raw materials normally account for about 90%
of the total.
   In 1988, commodities earned $18 billion for Africa, the
study said, but adjusted for inflation that was 26% lower
than in 1980 and 35% below 1970. The decline reflects lower
price levels and a much smaller international market share.

   Easing of Technology Export Controls
   May Boost Arms Smuggling in Mideast

   WASHINGTON -- The recent relaxation of Western controls on
technology exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe may
make it easier for countries in the Middle East to obtain
goods crucial to the production and use of nuclear weapons,
according to critics of the move.
   The items involved include krytrons and spark gaps,
electronic switching devices that were at the center of a
major flap in March when U.S. and British customs officers
arrested six members of an Iraqi ring. The six allegedly were
attempting to put packages containing the parts on a London
plane bound for Iraq.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The change in export rules, according to a spokeswoman for
the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration,
would allow shipment of various previously restricted items
to "certain reliable Eastern European countries like Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia." The U.S., she said, hopes to
negotiate safeguard procedures "by which those countries
closely monitor the end use of such items."
   But critics of the move charge that the relaxation could
accelerate the nuclear arms race in the Middle East. "This
means that Iraq can order U.S. bomb triggers through front
companies in Eastern Europe without breaking any laws,"
asserted Gary Milhollin, head of the Wisconsin Project on
Nuclear Arms Control, a Washington research firm.
   The Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls (COCOM), approved the deletion of 30
categories of technology from its export-control list two
weeks ago. At least six of the categories, according to Mr.
Milhollin, were previously banned because they could be used
to make nuclear weapons or guided missiles to carry them.
   "This points to the need for Cocom to start looking at
North-South proliferation," said Rep. Samuel Gejdenson (D.,
Conn.), chairman of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that
oversees international economic policy. "The real national
security risk we now face is Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya."
   The congressman added that he welcomes increased trade
with the East bloc as long as it doesn't create security
risks elsewhere.
   Iraq has established front businesses in Europe to shop
for controlled military technology, following the example of
Pakistan, which used a network of phony West German-based
companies during the 1980's to buy a large amount of
nuclear-weapons technology illegally.
   While West Germany and other Western European nations now
insist that these avenues are closed, allowing the technology
to flow into Eastern Europe will create more of them,
according to Mr. Milhollin. He told a Senate Foreign
Relations Committee panel last week that "these cash-starved
and capital-poor regimes do not have functioning
export-control systems. There will be a great risk that their
companies will break the conditions of sale even if
conditions are imposed."
   The technology involved in the changes includes spin
forming machines, which can be used to make high-speed
centrifuges for uranium enrichment, sophisticated
oscilloscopes, telemetry equipment and assemblies of quartz
crystals, all of which were previously controlled because
they could be used to develop missile-guidance systems.
   U.S. controls banning direct sale to proliferation-prone
countries remain in effect, according to the Commerce
Department.
   The best-known item removed from the 17-nation Cocom's
controls is probably krytrons, fast switching devices that
have featured in previous U.S. criminal cases against
Pakistani agents who tried to smuggle them out of the country
and an Israeli agent who succeeded.
   Krytrons are used in a variety of commercial devices,
including copying machines, but more sophisticated versions
have been used in the trigger mechanisms of U.S. nuclear
weapons, which require exact timing of electronically
triggered explosive charges.
   Donald M. Kerr, president of EG&amp;G Inc. of Wellesley,
Mass., the only U.S. manufacturer of krytrons, says he
applauds the Cocom decision because krytrons have widespread
commercial uses. "To recognize that this is 50-year-old
technology seems to be sensible," he said. Linking the
technology to nuclear-bomb making, he asserted, is "akin to
saying if you have a cigarette lighter, from that you might
get a car."

   Backers of Capital-Gains Tax Cut Beat Bushes
   To Locate Recruits for Their Lobbying Army

   HOUSTON -- Sarah Hull battles traffic for an hour to reach
a run-down shopping center next to a Dairy Queen. Her
mission: to enlist a new warrior in the fight for a lower
capital-gains tax.
   Ms. Hull, 28 years old, is a Washington-based operative
for the National Venture Capital Association. Her quarry this
day is a balding businessman named Reese Terry Jr. whose
small company, Cyberonics Inc., is housed in a tiny
storefront here. Stepping out of the scorching heat, Ms. Hull
wanders back to Mr. Terry's cramped office and hands him a
black folder filled with documents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are conducting a grass-roots campaign to lower the
capital-gains tax," she tells him. "Texas is important."
   Back in Washington, a constituent's word is said to be
worth that of five lobbyists. But on this issue, it may be
worth 15. Few tax changes are harder to sell at the
grass-roots level than a capital-gains cut, since the direct
benefits would overwhelmingly go to the richest Americans.
According to congressional tax experts, about two-thirds of
the benefits would go to the 1.3% of taxpayers with incomes
of $200,000 or more a year, and about 83% of the benefits
would go to the approximately 5% of taxpayers who have
incomes of $100,000 a year or more.
   That makes Ms. Hull's job especially challenging and, for
her employers, particularly important. Over the past year,
the Arlington, Va.-based National Venture Capital Association
has spent a quarter of a million dollars on the grass-roots
effort. Since February, Ms. Hull and an associate at the
public-relations firm of Robinson, Lake, Lerer &amp; Montgomery
have scoured a dozen states to find and train homespun
capital-gains advocates like Mr. Terry.
   Their prime targets are, like him, founders of young,
fast-growing companies who have struggled to scrape together
enough capital to make a go of it, and for whom a lower
capital-gains tax could be translated into the creation of
more jobs. From a politician's viewpoint, this is a
relatively compelling story -- more compelling, at least,
than self-interested pleas from the money men who pay Ms.
Hull to push for a capital-gains cut.
   "It sure as hell beats running up to the halls {of
Congress} and squeezing arms and throwing fat checks at
them," contends Daniel Kingsley, executive director of the
venture capital association. The group says it has pieced
together a network of about 250 entrepreneurs, and intends to
use them, as the need arises, to send letters to Washington,
to write opinion pieces for local newspapers, and to meet
with key lawmakers when they return to their districts.
   "We are trying to put a face on the issue," Ms. Hull
explains.
   Her efforts already have paid off. On March 20 she mailed
an urgent request to her recruits to write to Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski of the House Ways and Means Committee. A model
letter she enclosed asserted that without a capital-gains cut
"the entrepreneurial engine driving our economy won't just
stall; it'll be running on empty." In response, business
executives from Connecticut to California used the identical
phrase in letters to the Illinois Democrat.
   President Bush has made cutting the capital-gains tax a
priority. But the Ways and Means Committee, which originates
tax legislation, probably won't consider the change until
congressional leaders and the White House agree on a broad
deficit-reduction plan in budget talks currently under way.
   Here in Houston, meanwhile, Ms. Hull meets with success in
rounding up future capital-gains proselytizers from among the
business executives she meets. Mr. Terry readily agrees to
help. So does James Pritchett, president of Trinity Computer
Systems Inc., a maker of computer software for hospitals. "Be
happy to," he says over coffee in his conference room when
she asks him if he would visit a local newspaper's editorial
board.
   Ms. Hull also encourages Mr. Pritchett to help lobby the
main focus of her trip here, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas),
chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. "We
want to get a letter to Bentsen from you," she says, bluntly.
She also wants the executive to meet with the senator.
"That's something down the road we might want to organize,"
she says.
   "Any encouragement you can give will be helpful," she
adds. "It's much more convincing when it comes from a
business person in the district."
   In the course of the trip, Ms. Hull does meet with some
venture capitalists, but mostly she is referred to hands-on
managers who are more politically persuasive. She lunches at
the wood-paneled Century Club on the top floor of the First
Interstate Bank building here with David Hull, a principal of
Criterion Investments Inc. A natty venture capitalist in
pinstripes, Mr. Hull (who is no relation to Ms. Hull)
suggests she visit the MIT Forum, in which start-up companies
present their business plans for critique. "That's an
audience that's easy to sell," he counsels.
   "It's much more effective to push {the lobbying effort to
cut the capital-gains tax} down to the entrepreneurial
level," Mr. Hull suggests. "Then you can equate it to jobs."
   Ms. Hull endeavors to make it as easy as possible for the
entrepreneurs to lobby. The documents in the folder that she
provides them constitute a complete modern-day lobbying kit.
They include a sample letter to lawmakers that argues for a
lower capital-gains tax, with a place to "insert your own
story about your company." Another document lists "talking
points" that the executives can use to make the case for
capital gains, including this debatable statement: "Lower
taxes on capital gains will offer all Americans the benefits
of a productive and more competitive economy."
   The kit -- and Ms. Hull in person -- suggests that the
business executives can write an editorial for the local
newspaper advocating lower capital-gains taxes. Samples of
such articles written by other business executives are
included. Ms. Hull tells the executives that they needn't
worry too much about the wording, though, because she can
give them plenty of help; her company in Washington has three
ghostwriters on its staff for the purpose.
   Not everyone thinks that manufactured sentiment of the
kind Ms. Hull fosters is particularly effective -- including
some of the lawmakers she hopes to influence. "It takes the
spontaneity out of the process, and that is one of the things
that has the biggest impact," complains Democratic Rep.
Michael Andrews of Houston, one of the lawmakers Ms. Hull
mentions as wanting to reach.
   Sen. Bentsen also doubts that he will be swayed. "You can
very quickly determine the difference between grass roots and
Astroturf," he says. "It surely doesn't have the same
impact."
   Neither lawmaker, though, needs much persuading. Sen.
Bentsen has been working with the Bush administration to
develop a package of investment incentives that is likely to
include a capital-gains cut. And Rep. Andrews is one of the
six Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee who
unswervingly support the tax change. Earlier this year, Ms.
Hull's venture capital association even presented him an
award, which is in the shape of a golden egg.
   For this very reason, one of the executives Ms. Hull
visits, Stuart Schube of Acorn Ventures Inc., says he
probably won't write letters about capital gains to his local
lawmakers. "The bulk of the congressmen and senators in Texas
already understand it," he tells her. "You really ought to
check."

   Was Shut Down in 1989,

   WASHINGTON -- Security Pacific National Bank suddenly
closed its Third World debt-trading unit in April 1989 after
it had been in business for little more than a year.
   At the time, the closure of the unit, which was based in
New York, puzzled and surprised traders in the booming market
for Latin American and East European credits. But now new
information is coming to light that may help explain the
move.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to a report Sunday in the Independent, a London
newspaper, Antonio Angotti, the head of the Security Pacific
debt-trading unit, directed trades to be carried out that
involved selling loans at below prevailing market prices to
Fintech Inc., a small broker specializing in Mexican debt,
and that in one case involved a larger than usual commission.
Security Pacific National Bank is a unit of Security Pacific
Corp.
   The debt-trading unit was shut down after Mr. Angotti's
three colleagues at the unit -- Stephen Maitland-Lewis,
George Buxton and William Cisneros -- prepared an 80-page
report detailing these trading patterns. According to former
bank officials, they sent it to Security Pacific's then
Chairman Richard Flamson III in March 1989. Reached by
telephone, each of the trio declined to respond to questions.
   Mr. Angotti, who is now a White House fellow working at
the U.S. Treasury, declined to respond to questions and
directed telephone calls to his New York lawyer, Rita Hauser.
She said: "A total investigation was made. It went on for
many months. The bank concluded Mr. Angotti had done nothing
wrong." She added, "We entered into an agreement with the
bank," but didn't elaborate.
   Security Pacific issued a statement saying: "That very
small sovereign debt unit was set up for the purpose of
selling Security Pacific's less developed country debt --
then about $1.8 billion. Over the next 12 to 15 months the
unit did sell $1.3 billion. We were interested in selling it
down as quickly as was prudently possible. We think we did a
pretty good job. There was an audit which found nothing
untoward."
   According to the London newspaper, Security Pacific sold
$120.47 million of Mexican public debt to Fintech through
Swiss Bank Corp. on May 18, 1988, at 53 cents for each dollar
of face value. Fintech sold at least half that debt shortly
afterwards for 53.75 cents on the dollar, reaping a large
profit. Swiss Bank Corp. served as a guarantor of the Fintech
purchase, apparently because Fintech was a small broker.
   The transaction attracted the attention of New York debt
traders because it was very large for a secondary loan market
transaction. Generally, such trades total $20 million or
less.
   Reached by telephone, Jaime Montelegre, one of the two
owner-managers of Fintech, declined to comment on the
transaction. A Swiss Bank trader didn't return telephone
calls.
   During the short life of Security Pacific's debt-trading
unit, several New York debt traders at a number of Wall
Street firms remarked on how it seemed to concentrate its
debt sales on Fintech, which until that time had been a
relatively specialized and little-known broker.
   According to the Independent, when Security Pacific sold
about $3.3 million of Uruguayan central bank debt at 60.25
cents for each dollar of face value, Mr. Angotti directed one
of his colleagues, George Buxton, to send out payment
instructions directing that 2.25 cents on the dollar of the
money -- or $73,211.53 -- be sent to a Cayman Islands account
at Nederlandsche Middenstandsbank, account number a/c ABA-421
a/c 195340.
   That would be higher than standard commissions, and NMB
apparently wasn't otherwise involved in the transaction.
Peter Geraghty, who runs NMB's Third World debt-trading
operation, said, "To the best of my knowledge, NMB never did
any Uruguayan transactions with Security Pacific." As for the
account number, Mr. Geraghty, says that is the standard New
York clearing account through which all his bank's
international payments go.
   Richard Keller, who heads Security Pacific's Latin
American business and who was Mr. Angotti's boss, said: "We
undertook the better part of $1.3 billion of transactions. We
have been very explicit about what was undertaken, and we
have now shut down our trading unit."
   Mr. Keller said that "all the transactions that we
reviewed were appropriate," and added that the bank's
internal review of the case "was a standard audit undertaken
by internal investigators."
   As reported, the Federal Reserve is looking into some
suspected irregularities and improprieties in the so-called
secondary loan market, which is mostly based in New York but
also operates out of London. It isn't known whether the
Security Pacific case is part of that investigation.

   Merck to Cut
   Some Prices
   For California

   Merck &amp; Co. said it will cut prices for many prescription
drugs used by Medicaid patients in California, a move
expected to nudge other drug companies to offer discounts,
too.
   Officials from Merck and California said the company
agreed to lower prices about 8% to 12%, saving the state's
MediCal program about $2.8 million a year. Medi-Cal spends
about $30 million a year to reimburse pharmacies for Merck
drugs prescribed for Medicaid patients by physicians in the
state.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The officials said that in exchange for the price
reductions California will remove four of Merck's more
expensive drugs from a restricted list, which meant that the
state wasn't willing to pay for their use by Medicaid
patients. In particular, the state said it will begin paying
for prescriptions of Mevacor, a big-selling drug for lowering
cholesterol.
   Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., set off a stir in the
pharmaceutical industry in April when it announced that it
would offer state Medicaid programs its "best price" for
drugs if the states wouldn't restrict the use of Merck drugs.
Merck has provided discounts of about 10% to Veterans'
Administration hospitals and other military organizations,
but hadn't offered the same markdowns to states.
   Other drug companies offer even steeper discounts to the
VA, and matching Merck's "best price" offer to Medicaid
programs could involve deep price cuts for them. To date, no
other drug maker has publicly offered to reduce prices for
the state programs, although a spokesman for California's
Medi-Cal program said the state was negotiating a similar
arrangement with another company it declined to identify. The
state spends $570 million a year for prescription medicines
for Medicaid patients, about 16% of the $3.5 billion all
states spend on reimbursement for drug prescriptions.
   Several industry officials said Merck's offer is a clever
bit of marketing. Merck has an especially large list of
relatively new drugs that have premium price tags, one reason
why some states restrict their use and encourage doctors to
use less expensive medicines for Medicaid recipients.
   While the savings from Merck's discounts aren't large in
relation to total spending for medicines, California and
other states hope that other drug companies will be forced to
match the offer in order to get their drugs off restricted
lists, too. Merck said Utah and North Carolina have agreed to
take price discounts of about $100,000 each and it is
negotiating its discount offer with several other states.

   Law Firm Claims Intimidation by Ashland

   The Charleston, W.Va., law firm that successfully
represented four people in a $10.3 million environmental suit
against Ashland Oil Inc. alleges that the company has since
encouraged acts of intimidation against the plaintiffs.
   "We are going to show Ashland that they can't intimidate
people here," said P. Rodney Jackson, a plaintiffs' lawyer
with DiTrapano &amp; Jackson, who filed an amended suit against
the oil refiner in Kanawha Circuit Court in Charleston.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That suit didn't include the allegations of encouraging
intimidation; they will be filed later this week as part of a
related complaint, Mr. Jackson said.
   Ron Wallace, director of employee relations at the
company's Ashland Petroleum unit, concedes he helped form an
employee group that now numbers 4,000 to look into litigation
that could be brought against the plaintiffs. But both he and
Ashland deny any hand in trying to physically intimidate
plaintiffs, as Mr. Jackson alleges. Mr. Jackson claims the
company is causing acts of intimidation by making people
afraid of losing their jobs.
   "We feel that we're the injured parties here and that the
plaintiffs haven't been injured in any meaningful way at
all," said Mr. Wallace. Ashland is 23%-owned by its
employees.
   Ashland asked the Kanawha Circuit Court to overturn the
$10.3 million verdict or to grant the company a new trial. In
the trial, the plaintiffs -- residents of the area near the
refinery -- convinced the jury that the quality of their
lives had been impaired by pollution from the plant.
   The company alleged that 297 errors occurred during the
trial, among them, that jurors were allowed to hear
misleading evidence, garbled or incorrect jury instructions
and an inflammatory closing argument. In addition, the
company alleged that one of the jurors had been represented
in an unrelated personal-injury case by the plaintiffs' law
firm and that the juror should have disclosed the
relationship.
   Calling the trial "unfair" and the award "ridiculous," Mr.
Wallace said the verdict against Ashland could result in job
cutbacks and other economic hardships in the tri-state area
around Catlettsburg, Ky., where Ashland operates a refinery.
He claimed Ashland's plant there doesn't pollute any more
than other big employers in the region and that employees of
other companies also could lose jobs if other pollution suits
are filed.
   Ashland, through a spokesman, said it was aware of a
report about vandalism and intimidation published in Monday's
Charleston Gazette newspaper. But the spokesman said the
company hadn't verified the report and didn't necessarily
believe it. "Quite frankly, we're repulsed by these things if
they, in fact, had occurred."
   The story said a pickup truck and automobile had been
vandalized at two plaintiffs' homes in separate incidents and
that a woman plantiff had received a phone call in which she
was warned she wouldn't receive any of the money that she had
won in the trial against Ashland.
   In the plaintiffs' amended suit, Mr. Jackson's firm added
680 new complainants to the 500 originally listed. The
amended complaint seeks more than $2 billion. The case
against Ashland is being heard five plaintiffs at a time.

   HONG KONG practices of some U.S. law firms prove
disappointing.
   More than a dozen U.S. law firms have flocked to Hong Kong
over the years, setting up regional bases in the hopes of
capitalizing on the country's central location and new
economic opportunities in Southeast Asia. But many firms are
still grappling with how to best take advantage of those
opportunities -- and some have concluded that Hong Kong
doesn't seem to be the answer.
   "There is no question that the projection for economic
growth in Asia is substantial. But U.S. law firms haven't had
the kind of action they had anticipated," says Ward Bower of
Altman &amp; Weil, a legal management consulting firm in Newtown
Square, Pa.
   The latest firm to give up on Hong Kong is the New York
law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, which
has decided to close its five-lawyer Hong Kong office,
effective July 31. The firm's regional presence will be
consolidated in offices in Beijing and Tokyo. "We took a
realistic look at the environment we were dealing with and
reached a conclusion we felt was in our long-term interests,"
says Lewis A. Kaplan, a Paul Weiss partner.
   In recent years, Shearman &amp; Sterling and Simpson Thacher &amp;
Bartlett, two New York-based firms, have also closed branches
in Hong Kong.
   Separately, Graham &amp; James, a 360-lawyer firm, is forming
an association with 90-solicitor Deacons, one of Hong Kong's
largest law firms, effective Aug. 1. Under the association,
believed to be the first between a U.S. law firm and a Hong
Kong law firm, Graham &amp; James will close its Hong Kong
outpost and relocate to the Deacons office. The two firms'
Beijing offices will be combined, and Deacons lawyers in
Tokyo and New York will join Graham &amp; James's offices in
those cities.
   Under the present rules, U.S. lawyers are not allowed to
practice Hong Kong law and must refer work to local firms.
"There's only so much {foreign lawyers} can do. You're
limited in terms of economics and professional practice with
how far you can go. This {association} allows us to provide
the entire package of legal services to the client," says J.
Michael Cavanaugh, managing partner of Graham &amp; James.
   Political and economic troubles in China have also hurt
many of the U.S. firms, according to lawyers who have
practiced in Hong Kong. "There weren't the kind of big deals
and joint ventures coming out of China that everyone
expected," says John Kramer, the former head of Shearman's
Hong Kong office.
   Most of the firms say it is still too early to anticipate
what will happen after 1997, when China resumes sovereignty
over Hong Kong. But at least one firm is optimistic about the
future.
   Last October, New York-based Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
&amp; Flom opened an office there. "We think there is great
potential in the Far East," says Peter Mullen, Skadden's
executive partner. But he adds that following China's
suppression of student-led demonstrations last year, the firm
scuttled plans to open an office in Beijing.

   KAYE SCHOLER considers merger with bankruptcy boutique
Levin &amp; Weintraub.
   Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, a 355-lawyer New
York law firm, and the 14-lawyer New York bankruptcy firm
Levin &amp; Weintraub, Crames &amp; Edelman will decide by the end of
next week whether to merge their practices, according to
lawyers involved in the merger discussions.
   In recent months, Levin &amp; Weintraub has reportedly
approached several large firms about the possibility of
merging. The firm's clients, many of them debtor companies
involved in bankruptcy-law proceedings or restructuring,
include Manville Corp. of Denver, which has emerged from such
proceedings, and Dallas-based LTV Corp. The merger talks were
first reported in the New York Law Journal.
   Over the past five years, many bankruptcy firms have
merged with larger, more diversified firms. Because
bankruptcy problems are increasing in size and complexity,
boutiques must farm out much of a client's work to larger law
firms, bankruptcy lawyers say. "A bankruptcy case today
almost always has as its root something more than just
money," said Nathan Feinstein of Piper &amp; Marbury, who chairs
the American Bar Association's Business Bankruptcy Committee.
   Although the merger would substantially expand Kaye
Scholer's existing bankruptcy work, some of the firm's 106
partners harbor doubts about the proposal, because it would
involve granting partnerships to five lawyers from Levin &amp;
Weintraub, according to an individual close to the deal. He
said the firm has a tradition of not bringing in large
numbers of lateral partners.
   Kaye Scholer represents a number of large institutional
creditors, and some of the firm's lawyers are also concerned
that absorbing Levin's debtor clients might harm the firm's
image among its creditor clients, the individual said.
   Approval of the merger requires a two-thirds majority vote
by Kaye Scholer partners, according to another individual
familiar with Kaye Scholer's acquisition activity. The vote
will take place later this week, the individual said.

   PUNITIVE DAMAGES should be allocated to a "public
purpose," some lawyers propose.
   Defense lawyers have complained that punitive damages --
which are intended to punish the defendant and deter future
wrongdoing -- provide an unfair windfall to the plaintiff.
   If punitive damages are permitted at all, some defense
lawyers argue, these damages should be used to serve some
public purpose rather than to enrich the plaintiff. The
plaintiff should be allowed to receive only compensatory
damages, these lawyers say.
   Some 70 defense and plaintiff lawyers, along with
academics, journalists, insurance representatives and
industry officials, debated the pros and cons of such a
proposal last month at a meeting of the Seventy-Eight
American Assembly, a symposium gathered at Columbia
University to stimulate discussion on developments in tort
law. Debate split sharply between the plaintiff and the
defense bars, with many academics siding with defense
lawyers.
   "A corporation, if it does commit a wrongful act, should
not be punished over and over again for the same offense,"
says Leslie Cheek III, senior vice president for public
affairs at Crum &amp; Forster Inc. in Washington, D.C. Instead,
says Mr. Cheek, a company should be required to pay a large
punitive damage award only the first time it is found liable
for an offense. And the money, he says, should not go to the
plaintiff.
   "The idea is you make it a public atonement; you maximize
the publicity associated with that kind of conduct," says Mr.
Cheek, who participated in the symposium. Such a system would
still serve as a valuable deterrent against future misconduct
without exposing defendants to double jeopardy or driving
them into insolvency, he adds.
   How the punitive award would be spent might be determined
by the judge, by agreement of the parties or by some other
method.
   Plaintiffs' lawyers maintained that the idea would put an
end to punitive damage award. "You may as well say no more
punitive damages as say that punitive awards should go to a
public interest, because no {plaintiff} will go after them,"
says plaintiff's lawyer Paul D. Rheingold, in New York, who
was also a participant at the symposium. "Their hidden agenda
is to eliminate punitive damages."

   Publishing:
   Papers Take Alternative Path to Success

   As publisher of the Chicago Reader, an alternative weekly
newspaper, Robert A. Roth refuses to read daily papers. He's
afraid their stodgy ways might be infectious.
   Circulation and advertising revenue is slipping at the
nation's metropolitan daily newspapers, but alternative
papers are growing in number and generally posting higher
revenue. The 68 papers that belong to the Association of
Alternative Newsweeklies now reap $100 million-plus in
combined revenue, and their 3.5 million total circulation
includes an enviable share of the coveted 18- to 35-year-old
market, the very group that daily newspapers are having the
most trouble attracting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Roth's Reader, with its lengthy and sometimes
investigative cover stories, comprehensive arts coverage and
listings and fat classified section, is an industry leader.
Averaging 148 pages an issue, it took in $9.4 million in ad
revenue in 1989, its 18th year, up from $6.2 million in 1985.
   Though the alternative press started out as a reaction to
what it perceived as the political conservatism of
establishment papers in the late 1960s, the concept has
translated into a marketing gold mine for publishers who have
stuck with their papers. Alternative papers are proving
attractive to mainstream advertisers -- such as hardware,
stereo and shoe chains -- that are cutting back on mass
marketing through such major media outlets as metropolitan
dailies and television.
   "When the advertising people came up with the word `niche
marketing,' I had a name for who I was all along," says
Stephen M. Mindich, publisher of the Boston Phoenix. Mr.
Mindich's Phoenix Media Communications Group Inc., which also
includes printing operations, an FM radio station in Boston
and a paper in Providence, R.I., had revenue of $17 million
last year. The company plans to spread its niche expertise
next to two UHF television stations in New England.
   Almost all alternative weeklies are free to readers --
generally college-educated and often professional or
managerial types -- and derive their revenue from
advertising. Bicycle and futon stores and kitchen boutiques
with $200 mixers are staple ad clients. But national tobacco
and alcohol merchandisers are starting to see advantages in
"guerrilla buys" in alternative papers, says George Simpson
of Calet Hirsch &amp; Spector Inc., a New York ad agency. Late
last year, Mr. Simpson began buying ad space for PepsiCo
Inc.'s Stolichnaya vodka in the San Francisco Bay Guardian.
So far this year, he says, the ads have helped to boost sales
for the high-priced liquor by 30% in San Francisco.
   Still, "national advertising is never going to be the
bread and butter" of the alternative press, says Susan
Belair, national ad director for the Ruxton Group, which
represents the Chicago Reader and 10 other papers. National
ads are running 2% higher than last year in Ruxton papers,
but they still account for less than 5% of total ad revenue,
she says. Ms. Belair notes, though, that alternative papers
exclude from their national figures movie, music and other
entertainment ads, which account for up to 20% of revenue.
   A surprisingly small number of alternative papers fail.
Some, including the Independent, in Durham, N.C., are
struggling. The New Times, in Syracuse, N.Y., was sold and
became a more traditional community newspaper, and the L.A.
Reader has been losing money for years.
   Though stalwarts of the genre such as the Boston Phoenix
and the San Francisco Bay Guardian sprang up and grew in
cities known for their extensive youth cultures, alternative
papers today are profitable in such unlikely locales as
Chico, Calif., Lafayette, La., and Salt Lake City. Several
cities now have more than one paper, with six in the Bay Area
alone.
   The alternative weeklies group admitted seven new papers
this year and had applications from seven more. One newcomer,
Albie Del Favero, started the Nashville Scene as an
alternative paper two years ago when his investor group
bought a majority interest in a local shopper. After raising
"a little under $500,000" in funding, he recruited a reporter
from the daily Nashville Banner to be his editor and partner.
Other hiring had to be done on a shoestring; for a while the
Scene's photographer was a homeless person.
   Averaging about 32 pages an issue, the paper has since
built a circulation of 60,000. A cover story on allegations
of plagiarism at the Nashville Tennessean prompted the daily
to go public with its investigation, which led to the firing
of one editor and the reprimanding of another. "A lot of
daily newspapers are getting more and more into boosterism,"
Mr. Del Favero says. "We leave that to the Chamber of
Commerce. We're critics."
   Mr. Del Favero projects that his paper's revenue will hit
about $900,000 this year and $2 million to $2.5 million
within five years. Like its larger counterparts, the Scene's
classified advertising is an engine for both revenue and
circulation. Personal ads make it a bulletin board for young
people. "People will stop me at parties," says Bruce Dobie,
the paper's editor, "and say, `Oh, you're the paper with the
great personals.'"
   Some papers are adding "audio personals," featuring the
actual voices of lonely hearts through tapes on a 900-line
telephone service, and they can barely handle demand. The San
Diego Reader (which licenses its name from the Chicago paper)
started running audio personals in November and now averages
400 a week.
   The rising fortunes of alternative papers are stimulating
interest in acquisitions. New Times Inc. in Phoenix, Ariz.,
has been considering buying the Philadelphia City Paper. New
Times bought Denver's Westword in 1983 and spent about $1.4
million to start Miami New Times in 1987. The company's
papers, led by its flagship Phoenix New Times, now gross $14
million a year; the Miami paper became profitable after only
17 months.
   The Chicago Sun-Times, New Times Inc. and the Village
Voice each tried to buy the Chicago Reader over the past few
years, but the paper's owners, who started out in 1971 with
less than $4,000, refused offers of up to $26.5 million. (The
Village Voice, which predates and doesn't belong to the
alternative weeklies association, differs from the group's
members in that it has 100% paid circulation and a strong
national identity.)
   Outsiders also are seeing the lucrative side of the
alternative papers. Russ Smith and a partner sold their
Baltimore City Paper to Scranton Times Co., Scranton, Pa., in
1987 for $3.5 million. The paper's revenue has risen since,
says publisher Donald Farley, but he won't say when the
parent company will earn its investment back. Mr. Smith used
his windfall to start the New York Press in New York City.
   Alternative papers haven't retreated from the
anti-establishment editorial approaches of their early years.
The L.A. Weekly has done "how-to" guides on environmental
activism and stories on what Nicaraguan support groups on the
West Coast can do now that that country isn't so chicly
radical. The Washington City Paper has doggedly followed
political corruption and real-estate machinations in the
nation's capital.
   But the weeklies are taken more seriously now. For the
past four years, the Arizona Press Club's award for
newsperson of the year has gone to staff members of the
Phoenix New Times, including an award for the paper's 1987
probe of the murder of Don Bolles, a reporter for the Arizona
Republic. The Boston Phoenix was the only paper in New
England to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize last year.
Cartoonists Lynda J. Barry, whose work appears in Esquire,
Mother Jones and other magazines, and Matt Groening, of "The
Simpsons," started with alternative papers and still do
weekly strips for them.
   "The alternative press has been onto something that daily
papers have been very slow to understand," says Ken Doctor,
associate editor for features at KnightRidder Inc.'s St. Paul
Pioneer-Press. A former editor and publisher of the
alternative Willamette Valley Observer in Eugene, Ore., Mr.
Doctor works with Knight-Ridder's 25/43 Project trying to woo
young people back to daily newspapers. "The big dailies
laughed at what they considered throwaway sheets," Mr. Doctor
says. "Now there isn't one that doesn't have a Friday
(entertainment) section or isn't trying to customize its
product."

   Trinity Computers Miscalculate

   BELLEFONTE, Pa. -- In the converted red-brick armory here
that Trinity Investment Management Corp. calls its "money
factory," the stock-pickers seem to be losing their knack.
   The pickers, in this case, are computers. For years the
machines have done a marvelous job, crunching through reams
of data on 400 mostly large companies to pinpoint the 75 or
so stocks that find their way into the $4.9 billion of
portfolios Trinity manages. But now, the firm's performance
is weakening, a few clients are leaving, and the human money
managers are trying to explain what went wrong.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Trinity was one of the first money managers to rely almost
exclusively on computer models rather than portfolio managers
to make investment decisions. High-tech equipment handles
most of the task for Trinity's 110 clients, a diverse group
that runs the gamut from Texaco Inc. to the St. Louis-based
Daughters of Charity.
   Since it began managing money in 1981, Trinity has
outpaced the overall stock market by an average of about two
percentage points annually, climbing to the top ranks of U.S.
investment advisers. But Trinity's money factory faltered
badly this past year. The same computer-generated,
"quantitative" investment techniques that had often beaten
the market in the past produced a gain of 13.4%, less than
half the 31.7% rise of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   What went wrong? The computers did the job they were
supposed to do, but they were following an investment thesis
that fell out of favor in the market. What the computers were
programmed to buy was the kind of stocks that had been
winners in the past: stocks with high dividend yields trading
at low multiples of corporate earnings.
   About 11 percentage points of last year's 18-point lag
behind the S&amp;P 500 can be attributed to the value style of
investing programmed into Trinity's computers, the firm says.
And so Trinity, far from being inoculated against failure by
its highly statistical approach, got hurt just like more
traditional "value" investors including John Neff, who runs
the $8 billion Windsor Fund.
   "What we do is no different than what John Neff does, but
we can do it faster and more accurately," says 69-year-old
Stanford Calderwood, Trinity's chief executive officer. Mr.
Calderwood -- who turned to investment management in the
early 1970s after working as a newspaperman, a Polaroid Corp.
marketing chief, and a rainmaker for public television's
"Masterpiece Theatre" -- seems stoic about Trinity's 1989
results. "Statistically," he says, "we shouldn't catch
another 1989 for another 20 years."
   Yet Trinity for the first time has been losing clients
because of its investment results. Six left the firm in the
first quarter on performance grounds; three more departed for
unrelated reasons. Three new clients joined in the quarter
and one loyal client recently added $40 million to its
account. Even so, Trinity had $500 million less in client
money at the end of the first quarter than a year earlier.
And more recently Exxon Corp., which won't comment, pulled a
large account from Trinity, investment professionals say.
   Trinity still has an impressive client list. "From our
standpoint, the bad performance in one year is not enough to
want to make a change," says George Keane, president of
Fairfield, Conn.-based Common Fund, which picks money
managers for hundreds of college endowments. "I've had some
discussions with Stan {Calderwood}, and I know it has been
very distressing to him to be so much out of step with the
market."
   Trinity says it continues to put full faith in its
computer models. "If the model tells you to buy it, you buy
it, and if the model tells you to sell it, you sell it, so
you don't get hung up on individual stocks," says Mr.
Calderwood.
   He and his partner, Eric Levin, built Trinity around that
philosophy. After becoming an expert typist as a Navy
cryptographer in World War II, Mr. Calderwood worked as a
reporter for the Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader and United
Press International. In 1953, he joined Polaroid, moving up
to oversee its marketing and advertising. He lacked the
scientific credentials to rise higher and quit in 1970. Next
he served briefly as president of Boston's public television
station WGBH, where he made "Masterpiece Theatre" a
programming fixture and, after striking out with perhaps 20
companies, persuaded Mobil Corp. to pay for the series.
   Mr. Calderwood then entered investment management with a
firm whose clients included the Yale University endowment.
Mr. Calderwood, intrigued by the as yet untapped potential of
computers to sort through stocks, met Mr. Levin, then a
Pennsylvania State University doctoral student who had
designed a model to scan company earnings looking for
undervalued stocks. Mr. Calderwood became majority owner of
Trinity, Mr. Levin's fledgling company, with the idea of
selling their investment research to others. But when a
British investor asked Trinity to put its theories into
practice, the firm began managing money itself.
   Mr. Calderwood, rarely seen without a bow tie, is the
firm's Mr. Outside, dealing with clients from his Boston
office and writing extensively on investment topics. The
39-year-old Mr. Levin, who favors blue jeans and cowboy
boots, set up the money factory 11 miles from the Penn State
campus, where he serves as Mr. Inside overseeing the
investment operation.
   "Stan was what was needed to take Eric from a researcher
to a money manager," says Kenneth G. Mertz II, chief
investment officer of Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement
System, Trinity's largest client with about $300 million
invested with the firm. As for the firm's investment style,
Mr. Mertz says, "One of their problems is that they are
extemely early in their valuations."
   For example, Trinity was hurt in 1989 by its holdings of
retail and office equipment stocks in the fourth quarter, but
both groups rebounded in the first quarter. Mr. Mertz notes
that Trinity's style causes its portfolio to be volatile,
with big performance swings above and below market averages.
So although the firm lagged in 1989, Trinity topped the S&amp;P
500 by 10 percentage points in 1988.
   Trying to cater to clients worried about such swings,
Trinity says it will offer an alternative portfolio strategy
that should smooth year-to-year results. A third of Trinity's
clients eventually may switch to the less-volatile strategy,
Mr. Calderwood predicts.
   But while the portfolio mix might change, the investment
decisions will still be driven by the iron logic of computers
and not by the emotions of humans. "Everybody wants to
believe there is an investment genius, that there is some art
form to it," says Mr. Calderwood. "I don't believe it."

   Finance Firms Furnish
   Bigger Share of Loans

   AS REGULATORS pressure banks to retreat from deals loaded
with debt, small business is relying on less-regulated
business-finance firms for a growing share of borrowings.
   Financing from these outfits is costlier and sometimes
more conservative than before. But as Jon Melzer, managing
director of Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc., a New York investment
bank, says, "In some cases, it's going to be the only game in
town."
   Finance companies, such as General Electric Capital Corp.,
have always been a major source of funding for smaller deals.
Now, they are supplying not only unsecured, subordinated
loans but also more of the senior loans that typically were
provided by banks.
   In March, for instance, Westinghouse Credit Corp. provided
$20 million in senior and subordinated loans, plus $6 million
in working capital, for a management buy-out of Allied Steel
&amp; Tractor Products Inc. in Ohio.
   However, with competition falling, finance companies are
charging higher fees and interest than banks -- 25 to 50
basis points more on some senior loans -- or demanding larger
equity stakes in the deals that they fund.
   The finance companies say they are finding themselves with
almost as much business as they can handle, thus they also
are rejecting the riskier deals. That means requiring
borrowers to put up more equity before giving them loans and
steering clear of transactions where borrowers must sell
assets to service debt.
   "Clearly, the banks have backed off and that has opened
the market for those of us that aren't as rigorously
regulated," says Michael Litwin at Fuji Bank Ltd.'s Heller
Financial Inc. unit in Chicago. But "we only do deals we
think make economic sense."

   Copter Operators to Lose
   Some Lucrative Work
                                                                                                       

   HELICOPTER operators in California say the state is about
to become one of their biggest competitors.
   For years, a handful of helicopter operators have helped
the state fight forest fires, with some getting nearly $1
million a year from it. But the California Department of
Forests and Fire Protection is planning to acquire 20
Vietnam-vintage Army helicopters to do the job itself.
   Art Trask, manager of the department's helicopter program,
says the plan will save money, even when he includes the
$575,000 he expects it will cost to refurbish each aircraft.
He also says the state's safety record is better than that of
private contractors.
   The state has used old military choppers to fight fires
since 1981. The plan would nearly double its helicopter fleet
and, private operators claim, completely displace them. Steve
Sullivan says his San Jose firm in 1981 lost two of three
state firefighting contracts, which once accounted for half
of Aris Helicopter's annual revenue. "We survived," he says,
"but it was a pretty severe blow."
   The copter operators say California's plan contradicts
federal policy that discourages government competition with
the private sector. And the Helicopter Association
International estimates refurbishing the helicopters will run
closer to $850,000 a chopper.
   Says Frank Jensen, the trade group's president: "We
believe the government should govern and the private sector
should provide the products and services."
                                                                                                       

   Solutions to Pollution
   Can Get Owners a Grant
                                                                                                       

   THE U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is putting aside
its stick -- and offering a carrot for ideas on solving
pollution problems.
   The agency's Office of Asbestos and Small Business
Ombudsman promises to award grants of up to $25,000 to
small-business owners submitting the best plans for
developing little-known techniques for preventing pollution
or reducing waste. The agency has $800,000 to hand out. It
has worked with 16 small-business trade groups, which have
offered pointers on making the program work and plan to
promote it among their members.
   Firms have already expressed interest in applying for the
grants. Terry Printing Inc., a Janesville, Wis., printer, is
experimenting with soybean oil as a less-troublesome
substitute for petroleum oil in ink. Rampart Industries Inc.,
a Detroit metal-finishing and electroplating firm, is trying
a process that eliminates the pollutant sodium cyanide as a
catalyst in cadmium plating.
   The deadline for submissions is July 1. Grant recipients
will be announced starting in November.
                                                                                                       

   Video Releases Stretch
   Entrepreneurs' Ad Dollars
                                                                                                       

   SMALL FIRMS are turning to video news releases for
prime-time visibility.
   They are taking a cue from bigger companies, which have
already been using corporate video releases to describe a
product or service. Getting into the act can be even more
beneficial to small firms, which must make tighter ad budgets
go as far as possible.
   The releases, usually 60 to 90 seconds long, resemble news
coverage and are run by some TV stations seeking inexpensive
news and entertainment material.
   Arbitration Forums Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y., used a video
release featuring a client, an accident victim, describing
the benefits of arbitration over litigation. About 225
stations across the U.S. broadcast it, a company spokesman
says. Resulting in over 1,250 queries, the videocast "was one
of the best marketing investments we've made," he says.
   The releases, which usually cost $20,000 to $25,000 to
produce, are going to increase in importance for small
companies, says Michael Friedman of DWJ Associates Inc., a
New York communications firm. "It is the cheapest way to get
TV exposure without paying Super Bowl prices."

   Freshman Congressman Peter Smith of Vermont is outraged
that there has been no real investigation of the role
government officials played in creating the S&amp;L scandal. So
he introduced a resolution calling for an independent counsel
to look into the matter. Congress has tried to exempt itself
from the independent-counsel law, but Rep. Smith says it must
be included. "No sitting Member or former Member should be
able to escape scrutiny," he told us. Feeling the heat from
outraged constituents, more than 150 House Members have
signed on to Mr. Smith's idea. We're hardly among the
independent-counsel law's supporters, but it would almost be
worth the price of admission to see one of these
locked-on-target prosecutors go cruising through Congress's
participation in the S&amp;L scandal.

   Trump Shuttle
   Plans to Cut Some
   Weekend Flights

AIRLINES (AIR)

<LP>
   In a move signifying the continued weakness in the once
lucrative Northeast shuttle market, the Trump Shuttle is
quietly planning to cut more than 25% of its flights on
Saturday and four other round-trips  on Sunday.
   The change, which takes effect July 1, will likely
inconvenience hundreds of travelers. The airline isn't
planning any formal announcement, even though shuttle service
has been operated on an hourly basis for years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I assume we'll have some people showing up for canceled
flights," says Bruce Nobles, president of the Trump Shuttle.
But Mr. Nobles said the airline may compensate these people
with extra frequent-flier mileage points or some other bonus.
   So far, Trump's arch rival in the shuttle market, Pan Am
Corp., hasn't matched the change. Harris Herman, president of
the Pan Am Shuttle, said he was considering some schedule
adjustments, but added he didn't want to confuse the public.
The airlines have traditionally matched each other's fare
changes.
   Together, the two carriers carry about four million
passengers a year between New York and Washington and New
York and Boston in what had been considered one of the
industry's most prized routes. Fares are high -- $119 one-way
-- and the passenger clientele is among the industry's
richest.
   But since acquiring the shuttle from Eastern Airlines last
year for $365 million, real estate mogul Donald Trump has
watched the carrier struggle -- primarily because business
travel has slacked off in the Northeast. As reported, the
Trump Shuttle lost at least $85 million since starting up.
Much of the loss was from debt service, and the carrier
earned over $2 million from operations last April, according
to documents obtained by this newspaper. But Trump officials
concede the carrier's passenger loads have been below
expectations.
   In response, the shuttle recently laid off about 70
employees and cut back a few frills, such as its concierge
desk. Now it is planning to cancel four daily round-trips  in
both the Boston-New York and Washington-New York market on
Saturday, as well as two other flights in each market Sunday.
Those two days are easily the slowest ones for the shuttle
and Mr. Nobles said he was trying to "match capacity with
demand." He said the move wouldn't lead to more layoffs,
because the carrier would use the planes for more charter
flights.

   Meech Lake Pact
   Is Unlikely to Meet
   Friday's Deadline

   OTTAWA -- Prospects now appear dim for ratification of
Canada's proposed Meech Lake constitutional accord by
midnight Friday, a legal deadline.
   The Meech Lake accord is a package of constitutional
amendments that were drafted to deal with Quebec's demands
for greater autonomy. Political polls in Quebec indicate
strong support for Quebec separation from Canada if the Meech
Lake accord doesn't receive the necessary ratification by all
provincial legislatures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed amendments have run into strong opposition in
Manitoba and Newfoundland, which haven't yet ratified them.
   In Manitoba, a native Indian legislator, Elijah Harper,
yesterday blocked for the fifth time in a week efforts by the
Manitoba government to introduce a Meech Lake ratification
bill in the Manitoba Legislature.
   The Manitoba government can introduce the bill in the
legislature tomorrow without Mr. Harper's consent. But
political analysts said Mr. Harper, an Indian chief, could
use other procedural measures to delay consideration of the
bill beyond the Friday midnight ratification deadline.
   The Manitoba Assembly of Chiefs, which is advising Mr.
Harper, said their quarrel wasn't with Quebec, but with a
process of constitutional negotiations that hasn't addressed
their longstanding demands for greater self-government.
   The Manitoba chiefs yesterday rejected as inadequate new
federal government proposals to deal with their
constitutional concerns after the Meech Lake accord is
ratified.
   Phil Fontaine, leader of the Manitoba Assembly of Chiefs,
said in Winnipeg: "Our position is absolutely firm. We will
do all we can to ensure the demise of the Meech Lake accord."
The proposed amendments, which were negotiated three years
ago at Meech Lake, Quebec, would recognize Quebec as a
"distinct society" within Canada and grant new powers to all
provinces.
   Newfoundland's Legislature is to vote on a Meech Lake
accord ratification bill later this week. But Newfoundland
Premier Clyde Wells said he may cancel the vote if Manitoba's
Legislature isn't able to make a ruling. The outcome of a
vote by the Newfoundland Legislature is uncertain. The other
eight provinces have ratified the amendments.
   To extend the ratification deadline beyond Friday midnight
would require legislative action by all provincial
legislatures. Quebec has so far refused to consider any
extension.
   The political uncertainties have unsettled Canadian
financial markets. The Canadian dollar declined by 0.25 of a
U.S. cent yesterday to close at 85.13 U.S. cents in Toronto.
   Aron Gampel, Bank of Nova Scotia economist, warned of
further Canadian dollar weakness if the Meech Lake accord
fails. He said such weakness would delay but not eliminate
the prospect of a decline in Canada's comparatively high
interest rates.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney sent his top constitutional
adviser, Sen. Lowell Murray, to Winnipeg to try to get the
native leaders to drop their opposition to the constitutional
plan. But Chief Fontaine said the federal proposals didn't
contain "anything new. So there was no way that the chiefs
could accept that."
   Sen. Murray said he was "disappointed but not surprised"
by the Manitoba chiefs rejection of the federal government
proposals. He didn't indicate that the federal government was
planning any further initiatives to deal with the impasse.
   Provincial government leaders of Newfoundland, Manitoba
and New Brunswick agreed to submit the constitutional plan
for ratification by their legislatures after a week of
negotiations in Ottawa earlier this month. New Brunswick
ratified the accord Friday, becoming the eighth province to
do so.

   CMS Venture
   To Lease Back
   Midland Plant

   DEARBORN, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said the Midland
Cogeneration Venture, of which it is a 49% owner, completed a
$2.3 billion sale-leaseback transaction involving its
Midland, Mich., power facility and separately formed a
partnership to pursue a potential expansion of the plant.
   CMS said the new partnership, also 49%-owned by a CMS
unit, will pursue a potential expansion of the venture's
Midland, Mich., power plant to supply electricity to the
Midwestern U.S. and Canada. The original Midland Cogeneration
Venture partnership was formed by CMS to salvage a nuclear
power plant that was abandoned by CMS's predecessor company,
Consumers Power Co., and turn it into a gas-fired plant
producing both electricity and steam.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new partnership will seek to develop a market for
power that could be generated by the second of two turbine
generators left over from the failed nuclear plant, a CMS
spokesman said.
   CMS said the 25-year sale-leaseback agreement completed
Saturday and involving the first phase of the Midland project
was the largest such transaction ever in the U.S. The deal,
which had been held up by objections from Michigan utility
regulators, gives 65% of the Midland power plant to a
consortium of investors called Deerpath Group and 35% to a
unit of CMS.
   But CMS isn't just a part owner of the plant. It will
continue to hold a 49% interest in the joint venture that
will lease back and operate the plant from the new owners,
the CMS spokesman said.
   CMS valued its proceeds from the transaction at $1.8
billion, including $1.2 billion in notes, rights to another
$300 million in notes that are contingent upon successful
appeals of regulatory decisions and the value of its
ownership and leaseholder stakes in the facility itself.
   CMS is awaiting a decision from a Michigan appeals court
on how it may use proceeds from the Midland transaction.
State regulators contend the company should spend the money
only on the regulated utility operations of its Consumers
Power unit. CMS says it should be free to use the money for
other purposes.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, CMS shares closed at $30.875, down 25 cents.

   NEW YORK -- Technical factors achieved what economic
fundamentals haven't for weeks now: The dollar was pushed out
of its narrow trading bands against the mark. The U.S.
currency ended lower against all other major currencies
except the Canadian dollar.
   In trading late in the morning in New York, the dollar on
its way down crossed a line at 1.6830 marks where complex
charts told currency traders to sell it. Traders gave
differing reasons for the dollar's move to that point. Some
cited manipulations of a speculator, others pointed to the
preceding drop in U.S. stock prices, while still others
pointed to rumors suggesting the European Monetary System
will soon be realigned and that European central bankers want
to dump the Louvre Accord.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What happened afterward isn't in doubt.
   "It dropped like a stone," said Robert Ryan, foreign
exchange manager for Bank of New York. "People got caught the
wrong way, and they panicked."
   As they did so, the currency price passed levels -- at
1.6770 marks, for instance -- where stop-loss orders to sell
dollar were tripped.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6758
marks, down from 1.6875 marks late Friday in New York. The
U.S. currency also was changing hands at 153.66 yen, down
from 153.90 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.7145, up from
$1.7095.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 153.70 yen
soon after opening at 153.45 yen; it closed Monday in Tokyo
at 153.88 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at
about 1.6755 marks, down from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.6855
marks.
   Monday's plunge shook many dealers who had grown
complacent during the quiet morning hours. After some
volatility on Friday, said Alexis Egan, corporate foreign
exchange trader for Banque Indosuez, "people were comfortable
with the dollar settling back into its range {of 1.68 to 1.70
marks}. A big move was the last thing people expected, and it
took everyone by surprise."
   It also left participants looking for a "story" -- what
started it all. "People not willing to accept technical
answers look around for fundamentals," said David Gilmore,
foreign exchange analyst for McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei.
   Mr. Gilmore said he doubted fundamentals provoked the
plunge, but he wouldn't discount another explanation. A
speculative player, knowing the market wanted to buy dollars
until 1.6810-30 marks and sell dollars thereafter, may have
decided to take advantage of the thin, non-aggressive
dealings to swing the price there by selling large amounts of
dollars, he said.
   "So they go for it," Mr. Gilmore said. "They don't need a
story if they can get {the dollar} through support, and
there's nothing underneath it."
   The most likely fundamental to have precipitated the
decline is a late morning decline on the New York Stock
Exchange. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down 20
points in late morning trading, ended 53.71 points lower.
   The decline in the Dow contributed to "a soft sense that
things are going wrong {in the U.S.}," suggested Mr. Ryan of
Bank of New York.
   With recent indicators suggesting a slowing U.S. economy,
dollar traders have recently begun to take more seriously
such worries as higher estimates of the cost of the
savings-and-loan bailout and missed debt payments Friday by
Donald Trump.
   But Banque Indosuez's Ms. Egan, a self-described "chart
person," said she doubts fundamentals played a role in
yesterday's retreat. "There wasn't a tremendous amount of
interest in pushing the dollar lower," Ms. Egan said, noting
that the support it found at 1.6720-30 marks was only "soft."
   The dollar still could fall below its bottom yesterday in
the days ahead, Ms. Egan said. The market is technically
poised for a dollar rebound after the decline, she said --
"If everyone is short dollar, you can't go shorter" -- but
the fundamentals for the dollar are mixed.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $349.30 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $348.15 an ounce.

   Nelson Mandela survived 27 years in a South African
prison. It remains to be seen whether he can survive a
two-week visit with the American media. Mr. Mandela's visit
to the United States is scheduled to receive saturation TV
coverage, and by its end, there's little doubt that Mr.
Mandela will sit in the eyes of many millions of Americans as
a man of courage and moral stature. We're more than a little
worried, however, that the bright lights are going to wash
out most of the complex political issues that swirl around
this man and his country.
   Mr. Mandela arrives in the U.S. tomorrow and will address
a joint session of Congress next week. While most such events
will focus on Mr. Mandela as a symbol of determined
resistance to apartheid, he is in fact the leader of an
organization, the African National Congress, that is itself
divided over the means appropriate to dismantle apartheid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Back in South Africa, militant blacks accuse the ANC's
leaders of "selling out" by pursuing negotiations with the de
Klerk government. Mr. Mandela can speak for himself, but
often his statements and actions suggest a man either
unwilling to disown the violent terrorist tactics of many in
his party or unable to disengage from their authority.
   For instance, he will visit the U.S. fresh from trips on
which he repeatedly praised Moammar Gadhafi, Fidel Castro and
Yasser Arafat. This Thursday, Mr. Mandela is scheduled to
share a platform in New York with the three Puerto Rican
nationalists who spent 25 years in prison for the 1954
shooting of five Members of Congress inside the House
chamber. Organizer Jaime Estades says this "shouldn't alarm
anybody. Mandela is an ex-political prisoner who is meeting
with other political prisoners." Having been invited to
address a joint session of Congress, why does Mr. Mandela
feel obliged to show solidarity with people who shot up
Congress more than 30 years ago?
   When Mr. Mandela was released in February, we expressed
the hope that he would realize that a free South Africa can
be won without continuing the "armed struggle" that has
killed many innocent civilians. Zambia's President Kenneth
Kaunda, host for the ANC's main bases, and Archbishop Desmond
Tutu have called on the ANC to suspend its guerrilla actions.
But Mr. Mandela insists that the ANC won't renounce violence
as part of power-sharing talks.
   Mr. Mandela has met the PLO's Yasser Arafat three times,
more than with any other foreign leader. Mr. Mandela says,
"We are in the same trench struggling against the same enemy:
the twin Tel Aviv and Pretoria regimes, apartheid, racism,
colonialism and neocolonialism."
   Visiting Angola in April, Mr. Mandela singled out Fidel
Castro's Cuba as an "inspiration" and praised "its love for
human rights and liberty."
   Last month, Mr. Mandela went to Libya, where he said
dictator Moammar Gadhafi and he were "comrades in arms." Mr.
Mandela condemned the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya.
   While Mr. Mandela is able to spend time and praise on
Messrs. Castro, Arafat and Gadhafi, he canceled a scheduled
meeting in his own country with Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, at
which the two men were to discuss the bloody warfare between
their followers. Three days before the meeting, the ANC
leadership reportedly persuaded him not to meet with the
pro-Western head of seven million Zulus.
   Mr. Buthelezi is a nephew of the ANC's founder, and was a
loyal ANC member until the mid-1970s when he broke with the
group over its bombing of civilian targets. When asked about
Mr. Buthelezi in Rome last week, Mr. Mandela said the mere
mention of his name was "unfortunate." Mr. Buthelezi is
"totally isolated."
   On the ground in South Africa, the ANC is a different
entity than the one often praised in the West. The ANC is
particularly hostile to objective coverage in the black media
of its actions. Thami Mazwai, an editor of the country's
largest black newspaper, the Sowetan, recently told of how
black newspapers had been threatened by the ANC and other
groups unhappy with coverage of "necklace" murders and
classroom boycotts. He and a Sowetan photographer were
recently cornered by activists intent, he said, on murdering
the two. Bystanders intervened. A regional president of the
ANC recently told reporters that the group "expects most, if
not all, members of the media to become card-carrying members
of the ANC."
   Mr. Mandela leads a group that may soon hold
responsibility for the fate of millions of South Africans. If
he is serious about bringing peace to the country, someone
should ask him how it is in the best interests of his fellow
South Africans for him to visit Colonel Gadhafi as a comrade
while refusing even to talk to Mr. Buthelezi, the leader of
his country's largest tribe.

   Reality of Trading

   NEW YORK -- Despite a flurry of efforts to make 24-hour
trading a reality, investors probably won't see the full
scope of this high-tech future for years.
   A new system for U.S. night trading of options and stocks
was announced by the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, the CBOE's Cincinnati Stock Exchange
and Reuters Holdings PLC of Britain. Mainly for options, the
system could one day also handle hundreds of stocks including
those listed on the New York Stock Exchange. But the new
partners said it could be two to three years before the
system is up and running.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange's own plans for
24-hour trading could also be years down the road, despite
the Big Board's recent acceleration of movement in the area
and its prediction that a minimal amount of after-hours
trading could start as soon as this winter.
   There are two global electronic systems that will be
starting up in the near future, however. The National
Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq
over-the-counter trading system, on Sept. 1 is launching
Nasdaq International, which will offer computer-screen
trading of 400 to 500 stocks starting at 3:30 a.m. Eastern
time, before traditional U.S. trading hours. Also, the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters may have the Globex
after-hours trading system for futures running as soon as
November.
   Still, the day when stocks, futures and options all are
traded in the U.S. away from exchanges' traditional trading
hours won't be here for perhaps several years.
   "We see a world impatient for change, impatient for the
21st century to begin," James R. Jones, chairman of the
American exchange, said in announcing the Amex/CBOE venture.
   Leo Melamed, head of the Chicago Merc, said in an
interview that investors interested in such systems must be
patient. "If we're talking about (24-hour trading) in its
full scope -- securities, options and futures -- well, I
wouldn't want to speculate how long it'll take to get them
all on."
   R. Steven Wunsch, an expert on electronic trading systems
who formerly worked at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., said, "It's
even questionable whether people need to trade continuously
in the daytime, much less the nighttime." Like other experts,
Mr. Wunsch said he's unsure about the size of the potential
audience for after-hours trading.
   Of course, the pace of change could be quickened by more
joint ventures between the exchanges.
   Indeed, Mr. Melamed and the chairman of the CBOE, Duke
Chapman, both said there are preliminary discussions about
one day merging the Amex/CBOE system with Globex, especially
since both systems are being run through Reuters. Such a
merger would potentially create a dominant after-hours
network for stocks, futures and options and give any Big
Board system a run for its money.
   A combined system, especially if it includes additional
exchanges, would offer investors "the total flexibility of
options, stock-index options as well as futures and futures
options," Mr. Melamed said, adding that he's excited by the
"magnetism of volume attraction that such a system would have
world-wide."
   The proposed CBOE/Amex system would operate between 6 p.m.
and 6 a.m. Eastern time. The exchanges and Reuters have a 12
1/2-year agreement, they said, which was approved by the
boards of the CBOE, American and Cincinnati exchanges in the
past two weeks. Regulatory approval by the Securities and
Exchange Commission is still required.
   Even before any of these modern systems blow their first
fuse, their backers are posturing about whose system is best.
   For example, in an unexpected development, the Amex/CBOE
partners said that they had, through Reuters, invited the Big
Board "several times" to join their new system and that they
hoped the invitation would be accepted. The Amex/CBOE
partners clearly enjoyed the implication that the mighty Big
Board would fall in line behind them.
   Big Board officials responded with thinly veiled sarcasm.
"We'd like to invite them to join our off-hours trading
system," said the Big Board's spokesman, Richard Torrenzano.
"It would seem unnecessary for them to build a redundant
system" to the Big Board's trading operation, which can
handle "on an average day all the trading capacity of all the
stock exchanges of the world," he said.
   The Big Board has been talking about 24-hour trading for
about two years. "We could move more expediently than anyone
else in this process" if investor demand is there, said Mr.
Torrenzano.

   World Cup: Hooligans and Mad Cows

   Milan -- Researchers in Great Britain have discovered that
during the World Cup, suicides drop by about 15%. But
scientists in West Germany have determined that heart attacks
are likely to rise. And so it goes during the monthlong
extravaganza; soccer fans take the good with the bad. For
example, millions of partisans from all over the world
continue to root for their teams, even though a Kenyan witch
doctor named Abubakar Omar Shariff already has announced that
Italy will win the tournament.
   The Italians are taking nothing for granted, however, and
have been showing a stern face of late. Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti has said that the people responsible for bungling
World Cup preparations should be thrown off a cliff, the same
one that was used to execute traitors in classical times. The
Italian team doctor has forbidden his players to eat butter
during the tourney, instructing them to increase their pasta
intake. "It's important not to tire out the digestive
system," he says. Host cities have banned the sale of all
alcoholic beverages during game days. And the pope had to cut
short a visit to the parish of San Remigio in Rome because a
match was starting. "The pope must not even try to compete
with the national duty to be in front of the television," he
pontificated.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Italians have been so distracted by the games that
they have entirely neglected what would otherwise be the
story of the hour. A man in Naples is filing a claim with an
insurance company, arguing that because another driver hit
his parked car, his girlfriend got pregnant. The crunch
apparently distracted him during lovemaking: "We were minding
our own business when we were hit by the other car and that's
when my girlfriend became pregnant."
   It's the British, though, who have had the worst few
weeks. First, British beef was banned on most of the
continent. It's not clear how you can tell, but apparently a
lot of British cows have gone crazy. The Europeans fear that
by eating British beef they will get Mad Cow disease
themselves. In the U.S., crazy cows would be
de-institutionalized and classified as "homeless," but in the
U.K. they get their heads chopped off, are piled into big
mounds, and get charbroiled.
   British soccer fans have not had it quite that bad, but
almost. Innocent non-hooligans have been attacked by local
fans, and are having trouble gaining admittance to bars and
restaurants.
   In Europe, even hooligans have bureaucracies. British
police keep files on about 500 known hooligans; those that
set foot on Italian soil are being kept under surveillance
during their stay. But the West Germans have caused the bulk
of the trouble. In Milan some of them went on a mini-rampage
the afternoon of their game against Yugoslavia. Fortunately,
on the subway train to the game that evening, I was wedged in
next to a preppy hooligan, and therefore felt pretty safe. He
had a blue cravat tucked into a sharply pressed Oxford shirt,
covered by a gray, V-neck cardigan. Around his neck there was
a brass horn that would allow him to urge on his team in
three different octaves.
   If the German fans want to look intimidating, they are
going to have to stop wearing those weenie hats. Many a
rough-hewn face was topped by a soft creampuff of a bonnet in
the shape of failed souffle. Perhaps it is a legacy of
central planning, but the Yugoslavs only sported one type of
hat, a simple baseball cap with Yugoslavia written on the
front, serviceable for many occasions.
   There was almost no drinking around the stadium, though
there was trash everywhere, and not a garbage receptacle to
be seen. The scalpers were given relatively free reign. Each
transaction was monitored by dozens of onlookers, trying to
track the market-clearing prices as they fluctuated
throughout the afternoon. I was offered a single ticket for a
price, expressed in Italy's exponential currency, of 15 times
10 raised to the fourth power, or about $125.
   Each fan was probed by the police at the entrance to the
stadium, in a manner too personal to describe here. The
inspection was of intense interest to prospective smugglers,
most of whom realized their own efforts to sneak contraband
into the stadium would be foiled. If a fan was carrying a
flag on a wooden dowel rod, it was replaced with a harmless
cardboard version.
   The German fans are known for being extremely optimistic,
and they often begin celebrating their team's victory before
the game starts. Fully two hours before play commenced, they
already were singing their lungs out and jumping up and down,
an exertion that was to continue almost without break over
the next four hours. Fortunately, the Milan stadium has
passed its safety inspections, unlike many others, including
Rome's.
   For the American, World Cup soccer offers several bizarre
spectacles. In the first place, no player ever just falls
down. He writhes on the ground in ostentatious agony for a
good 30 seconds until the trainer scrambles out and all eyes
are upon him. Then, those apparently shredded ligaments are
miraculously healed, and the player rises with a manly
grimace.
   The player who suffers the most mental agony is the
goalie, who is perpetually disgusted with his players. Either
he is exasperated by their inability to run faster up the
field when he is about to kick the ball, or he is sickened by
their lack of defensive hustle. Sometimes he seems as if he
is about to storm off the field in a fit of rage.
   Americans also will find that European football generates
a less rationalistic style of television commentator.
American football requires an engineer's skill for
diagramming complex schemata. But soccer is more like music,
and the commentators talk about the flow of the game, and the
imagination and creativity of the players.
   As for the American team, it emerged with its
self-respect, after only being beaten rather than dismembered
by the Italian team. All the same, Americans have not shown
much interest in their team, as all the empty hotel rooms in
Florence, where the U.S. plays, demonstrate. It now seems
like a giant mistake to hold the World Cup in the U.S. in
1994. That will merely make life inconvenient for the
billions who do care about soccer. On the other hand, maybe
the U.S. will pass some anti-hooligan laws in 1994 and apply
them to the Detroit Pistons.

   The mayor of Leningrad, Anatoli Sobchak, made a succinct
comment on last week's Supreme Soviet decrees authorizing
President Gorbachev to move quickly toward economic
restructuring. "I think we'll get to see where Mikhail
Sergeievich stands," said the MP from Leningrad. "Does he
believe in radical economic reform?"
   Mr. Gorbachev has been talking a lot about market
economics. On his U.S. tour he arranged a visit with Milton
Friedman in Palo Alto. But he now is armed with parliamentary
backing -- or so it seems -- for three drastic pro-market
steps. They are denationalization of state-owned property,
the installation of anti-monopoly rules and the creation of a
new banking system and stock exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At first glance it looks like a breathtaking mandate,
coming from a legislative body that has been as timid as Mr.
Gorbachev about effective free-market measures. Presumably,
the Parliament was frightened at the public outrage and panic
buying generated when the government's economic plan,
stressing price increases, was put forth by Prime Minister
Ryzhkov last month. Most likely, the Parliament believes that
the Soviet economy is nearing collapse, which is probably
true.
   President Gorbachev is being authorized to transfer
control of huge amounts of property from the central
bureaucracy to the individual republics, including the
Russian federation headed by his rival Boris Yeltsin.
Property ownership gives communist governments much of their
political power through ownership of the buildings where
people live and the factories where they work. Now, that is
supposedly to be passed to lower levels of government.
Denationalization of 60% of state property within three years
is said to be envisioned.
   It is by no means certain that the republics will be more
eager than the central government has been to privatize
property. One thing is certain. If such transfers are made,
the Soviet Union will be taking a big step toward
decentralization. That process already is under way on an ad
hoc basis as a result of declarations of independence in the
Baltic and southern republics, not to mention Russia itself.
Giving control of property to those republics demanding
outright independence may appease them for a while, but Mr.
Gorbachev will wonder for how long.
   As to anti-monopoly legislation, what can that mean? Will
Mr. Gorbachev start privatizing industry, doing it in such a
way as to create competing companies in each industry?
Presumably the creation of a stock market envisions something
like that, but you have to privatize first before a stock
market makes any sense. And is that new banking system to be
privatized as well?
   A lot of this, it seems, will be up to Mr. Gorbachev. But
will he have the stomach for it? For that matter, there is
the question of how one goes about conducting a massive
transfer of titles to property in a place like the Soviet
Union. Reflexively, the central bureaucracy will be tempted
to stall and play games when confronted with this enormous
task.
   But perhaps all that will be irrelevant. Backed by the
sense of legislative intent in the Supreme Soviet, don't be
surprised if the republic and local authorities start taking
over whatever is within their immediate reach. Some already
are.
   Mr. Gorbachev has a choice. He can either dismantle the
Soviet empire or watch it dismantle itself. Little wonder he
hasn't been feeling well of late.

   $2 Billion in Liabilities

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. may require LTV Corp. to reassume
liability for more than $2 billion in employee pension plans
that the company stopped funding in 1987.
   The ruling strongly reaffirms the authority of the
troubled pension agency, which is operating with a $1 billion
deficit, to protect the federal pension-insurance program
that it administers. An adverse high court ruling could have
increased the deficit to $7.8 billion if other companies
followed LTV's lead of filing for protection under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code and stopped funding of pension
plans, agency officials warned Congress last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling "does send a strong message to all companies,"
said James Lockhart, the agency's executive director, that
they must fund plans adequately and not dump them, "unless
there's a real need."
   The ruling is also likely to impede LTV's efforts to
complete a reorganization plan and emerge from Chapter 11. An
LTV spokesman said the situation "still has not changed -- we
couldn't afford the plans then, and we can't afford them
today."
   The high court decision, written by Justice Harry
Blackmun, focused on the complex -- but not unusual --
situation in which a company stops funding pension plans,
either because of a Chapter 11 filing or some other inability
to keep up with the growing liability, and then institutes
new pension plans to accommodate union demands.
   When a company stops funding pension plans, the pension
agency, which would become liable for the shortfall, has
authority to terminate the plans so that the liability
doesn't continue mounting.
   But the agency has adopted a policy that prohibits
companies from instituting what the agency calls "follow-on"
plans that effectively reinstitute the same benefits in new
plans after shifting the old liability to the agency. The
agency views such plans as an abuse of the insurance program
and responds by ordering companies to restore the old plans
and the liability that goes with them.
   That was the scenario that evolved between the agency and
LTV. But agency officials have warned that they could face
similar problems with other steel companies, and with
companies in the auto and airline industries as well. Agency
officials have declined to name the other companies. Mr.
Lockhart said the agency is currently negotiating with "a
handful of companies that want to terminate their pension
plans" and that most "would have liked to have had some sort
of follow-on plan."
   Yesterday, agency general counsel Carol Connor Flowe said
the high court ruling was "extraordinary" in how far it
supported the agency, even ruling that it need only consider
the policies of federal pension law and not of bankruptcy law
in deciding whether to make companies liable for abandoned
plans.
   LTV filed for reorganization in federal bankruptcy court
in 1986, partly because the three pension plans run for
employees of its LTV Steel Co. subsidiary were underfunded by
$2.3 billion, including $2.1 billion in benefits insured by
the agency.
   In January 1987, as LTV Steel continued to operate while
in bankruptcy court, the agency terminated the three pension
plans to avoid continued underfunding. Agency insurance
assumed the liabilities for benefits owed under the plans.
   A few months later, under pressure from the United
Steelworkers of America, LTV instituted a program to provide
retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans.
The agency, however, viewed the new plan as an abuse of
federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability
from LTV to federal insurance. In September 1987, the agency
ordered LTV to reassume liability and funding for the three
original plans.
   LTV challenged the order, and a federal district court
ruled in June 1988 that the agency improperly ordered LTV to
reassume the plans' operations. In May 1989, a federal
appeals court in New York agreed that the agency exceeded its
legal authority.
   Yesterday, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court
ruling. Justice John Stevens dissented.
   The agency's Mr. Lockhart said LTV has suggested it may
try to terminate the three plans again, but the agency
doesn't think the steelmaker can do that legally. Moreover,
Mr. Lockhart said, "We're convinced that it has the viability
to afford these plans." The agency will continue to insure
the three plans in the event that problems arise, he said.
   The pension agency said the ruling will benefit 60,000 LTV
retirees and 40,000 active workers. Agency officials said LTV
must assume liability both for the $2.1 billion and for
hundreds of millions of dollars more that hasn't been paid
since 1987.
   In response to the Supreme Court decision, LTV issued only
a terse statement saying it will continue searching for a
solution that recognizes its inability to fund the plans. In
practical terms, that means negotiating with the agency to
seek partial funding.
   Alternatively, the LTV spokesman said, the company could
terminate the plans again. Still, he said, LTV is taking the
position that negotiations will succeed and that the court
decision "is an unfortunate bend in the road, but it's only a
bend -- it's not a dead end."
   LTV's creditors, meanwhile, took a less philosophical
view. The ruling means the agency's claims will take
precedence over theirs. "It comes as bad news for creditors,
that's for sure," said Larry Handelsman, an attorney for the
unsecured creditors' committee. Any funding of the pension
plans, he said, "comes directly from the pockets of the
creditors." (PBGC vs. LTV Corp.)

   You've seen it on TV] The "seminar" on making millions in
real estate. The "talk show" about a miraculous anti-aging
cure. The "investigative report" about the healing powers of
bee pollen.
   You may be seeing less of it starting now. After an
explosion of "infomercials" during the laissez-faire Reagan
years, the Federal Trade Commission has launched a crackdown.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In several recent cases against infomercials -- including
one touting a diet aid that had the former president's son,
Michael Reagan, as host -- the FTC has set out guidelines for
the first time. Among other things, the new rules make it
virtually impossible for some of the dicier infomercials,
hawking miracle cures and diet claims, to get on the air.
   Since 1985, when the first "infomercials" were broadcast,
the half-hour and hour-long commercials for often
dubious-sounding products have exploded. Shown late at night,
they look like bad versions of "Donahue." They promise cures
for baldness and arthritis, aging and impotence. As their
hosts, they have fading celebrities like former "Carol
Burnett Show" regular Lyle Waggoner (for an impotence cure)
and onetime "Man from U.N.C.L.E." star Robert Vaughn (a
baldness elixir).
   The FTC has served notice on the ad community by not
prosecuting the fly-by-night companies that make many of the
offending products. Instead, the FTC is prosecuting the
infomercials' producers, which create the programs and often
fill the orders as well, and who have deeper pockets.
   Taking on the production companies "may be a more
effective means of law enforcement than pulling dandelions,
going after each of the little companies out there," says
Joel Winston, assistant director of the division of
advertising practices at the FTC. He adds: "There's real
concern that infomercials are being used to push bogus
products. There is more than the usual share of fraudulent
advertising through these infomercials."
   The FTC has brought just a half dozen cases against
infomercials. Its breakthrough case came in April, in an
action against Twin Star Productions of Scottsdale, Ariz.
Twin Star had been airing three infomercials for various
products, including a spiel by Mr. Reagan for a patch worn on
the wrist that was supposed to be a diet suppressant. Other
informercials were for a baldness cure and a male impotence
cure; the latter message was in the form of a talk show with
Mr. Waggoner as host.
   The FTC claimed that the products' claims were false and
unsubstantiated and that the 30-minute infomercials misled
people into thinking they were consumer programs, not paid
ads. Twin Star signed a consent decree under which it agreed
to pay $1.5 million and not to air the infomercials again.
   As part of the consent agreement, which has been open to
public comment and isn't yet official, the FTC set out the
guidelines for infomercials. Among other things, it demands
"reliable scientific evidence" before a product can make any
performance or safety claims. It requires infomercials of 15
minutes or longer to include disclosures saying the program
is a paid commercial. The disclosures must run at the
beginning and end of the program, as well as before ordering
instructions are given.
   Twin Star's chairman and president, Jerald Steer, says the
company believes it "didn't do anything wrong" and "it wasn't
fair for us to be singled out by the FTC." But, he says, he
is "glad . . . because now we have some rules to follow. The
problem with the FTC and the infomercial business is there
were no rules."
   Already, there are signs that the FTC, through its Twin
Star and several previous actions, is putting a damper on
some of the more dubious infomercials. Mr. Steer, for one,
says that while he used to accept claims made by doctors
selling products through infomercials, "I would no longer run
that today without doing our own studies." Twin Star does
still run infomercials for products like the "Stainarator"
spot remover and "Joe Namath's Power Band" exercise equipment
but puts the "paid commercial" disclaimer on them.
   TV Inc., a Largo, Fla., infomercial producer, has gone a
step further. It will no longer create infomercials for
"anything that has to be ingested," whether that be diet
pills or health foods, says William M. Thompson, president.
"There's too much baggage. If you have health and nutrition
claims, you'd better come up with {ironclad} studies. This
isn't kid stuff."
   Mr. Thompson should know; he, too, has felt the wrath of
the FTC. TV Inc. recently settled a case involving an
infomercial for Mountain High Bee Pollen, which claimed to
provide relief for everything from allergies to aging to
arthritis. After being charged with deceptive advertising
last year, TV Inc. agreed to send a letter to purchasers
telling them the program was a commercial and that its claims
were unsubstantiated.
   Mr. Thompson says he had "no problem" with the FTC, and
that he will no longer deal with the bee pollen company. TV
Inc. now also uses "paid commercial" disclaimers and
investigates the background of people trying to sell things
through its infomercials.
   In an interview, the FTC's Mr. Winston suggests some other
infomercial practices the FTC looks askance at. It frowns on
infomercials that masquerade as programming by taking
"commercial breaks." It also sees a red light when
infomercials are set up as "investigative" reports; Mr.
Winston dubs those "the most clearly deceptive." But
infomercial producers and sponsors interviewed say they don't
see any need to change those practices until they hear a
directive from the FTC.
   To the casual viewer, it might not seem as if much has
changed despite the FTC's involvement. Real estate and
baldness cure infomercials still rule the airwaves. In
congressional hearings about infomercials earlier this month,
even the Association of National Advertisers, a trade group,
lashed out against infomercials and asked that the FTC hold
"producers and advertisers . . . to the same high standards
for truthful, nondeceptive advertising as would be required
for any other advertising format."
   But TV Inc.'s Mr. Thompson says viewers just don't realize
how selective infomercial producers really are. Just consider
the products his company has turned down, he says. Among
them: A Palestinian group wanted to sell "Freedom stones" --
the rocks they throw at Israelis -- for $19.95 each, while a
woman wanted to sell a no-fail diet that she explained she
learned from extraterrestrials.

   Exception to Patent-Infringement Law
   Is Applied by Justices to Medical Devices

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that a company may
test-market a medical device on which another firm holds a
patent if the effort is part of an attempt to obtain federal
clearance to develop similar devices.
   The court determined, 6-2, that a federal law creating an
exception to patent-infringement claims to allow information
to be gathered about drugs also applies to medical devices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decision was a victory for Medtronic Inc. of
Minneapolis, which was sued for infringement by Eli Lilly &amp;
Co. of Indianapolis. More broadly, it is a substantial defeat
for older, established medical-technology developers with
long-held patents, allowing more leeway and flexibility to
newer, upstart companies.
   Older concerns, such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. warned in friend-of-the-court briefs
that such a decision would "curtail innovation" by
manufacturers of medical devices. But the attorneys general
of 19 states and the American Association of Retired Persons
filed briefs saying such a ruling would enhance competition
in design and marketing of medical technology.
   The decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, required
the court to interpret a 1984 technical amendment to the
federal law that regulates food, pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics. The amendment said it isn't patent infringement to
use or sell a "patented invention" of another company if the
purpose is "reasonably related" to obtaining data to submit
to the FDA.
   The FDA must approve all new drugs and medical devices.
The amendment was intended to allow competitors to enter the
commercial market as soon as a patent expires, rather than
waiting until then to start the test marketing.
   Lilly sued Medtronic for infringement of its patent for a
pacemaker that regulates tachyarrhythmia, or a too-fast
heartbeat. Medtronic cited the 1984 amendment, asserting that
it is manufacturing its own implantable heartbeat regulator
for clinical testing to provide data to the FDA.
   Lilly argued, and a federal district court in Philadelphia
agreed, that the amendment applied only to drugs and wasn't a
defense to patent-infringement claims on medical devices. In
1988, a federal jury awarded $26.6 million to Lilly for
patent infringement.
   But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
which handles all patent appeals, ruled in March 1989 that
Congress didn't intend to limit the provision to drugs. The
appeals court sent the case back to the district court to
decide whether Medtronic's use of the devices was solely for
the purpose of gathering FDA clinical data. But Eli Lilly
appealed to the high court, putting the issue of Medtronic's
purpose on hold.
   Yesterday, the high court sent the case back to the court
to decide the validity of Medtronic's claim that it was
marketing the implantable heart regulator to gather
information for its FDA application.
   Justices Anthony Kennedy and Byron White dissented, saying
Congress intended to limit the 1984 amendment to drugs.
Justice Sandra O'Connor didn't participate in the case. (Eli
Lilly &amp; Co. vs. Medtronic Inc.)
                                                                                                       

   Suing Thrift Regulators
                                                                                                       

   The justices agreed to decide whether federal law allows
lawsuits for damages for the actions of federal bank
regulators that allegedly cause losses to former thrift
directors. The high court agreed to hear an appeal by the
Justice Department in a dispute with Thomas Gaubert, a former
Democratic fund-raiser and onetime chairman of Independent
American Savings Association of Irving, Texas.
   A federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled in October
1989 that Mr. Gaubert may sue the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which Congress
has since replaced with the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Mr. Gaubert charged that he lost $25 million in property,
which bank regulators required him to contribute to bolster
the thrift's assets. The contribution was part of an
agreement in which Mr. Gaubert gave up control of the Texas
thrift in exchange for regulators' dropping an inquiry into
his role in an Iowa thrift.
   While under the control of federal regulators, the Texas
thrift's value dropped from $75 million to a negative balance
of $400 million, wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert's
property.
   Mr. Gaubert, along with four other former officers of
Independent American, was sued last month by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. for approving investments that the
FDIC said caused about $50 million in losses at the Texas
thrift. Last year, Mr. Gaubert was acquitted of bank fraud
charges brought by the Justice Department in connection with
the Iowa thrift.
   The case before the Supreme Court involves the Federal
Tort Claims Act, which allows lawsuits for damages against
the government. The Justice Department argues that the
lawsuit is barred by a legal exception to the act unless
government employees were performing "discretionary"
functions. But the appeals court ruled that the actions of
federal regulators with regard to Independent American were
"operational" in nature and weren't covered by the exception
for discretionary functions. (U.S. vs. Gaubert).
                                                                                                       

   Apple Computer Case
                                                                                                       

   The justices refused to hear an appeal by disgruntled
shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. who filed a
securities-fraud lawsuit after Apple's stock dropped 75% in
1983. The lawsuit contended that the company and its
directors made misleading statements about the sales
prospects for the Lisa computer and companion Twiggy disk
drive. In 1987, a federal judge dismissed the class action
without a trial, finding no evidence of a securities-law
violation.
   In September 1989, a federal appeals court in San
Francisco affirmed the dismissal of most of the lawsuit. The
appeals court ruled that Apple's directors didn't
intentionally mislead investors about Lisa's outlook, because
the directors reasonably thought the prospects for success
were good. Moreover, the appeals court said that Apple's
optimistic statements about Lisa were offset by gloomy
forecasts and criticisms that reached the market through the
news media.
   The appeals court ordered a trial on one issue of whether
Apple officials made misleading statements because they knew
of technical problems with the disk drive that would affect
production of the computer. That part of the case may now
proceed. (Schneider vs. Apple Computer Inc.)

   MARBLE HALL, South Africa -- It is a typical winter's day
in the cotton fields of South Africa: Sunny. Warm.
Apocalyptic.
   Over at the home of Neville Mallinson, who owns 37 Bibles
and a Shell service station, talk of Armageddon fills the
living room air. The host offers a pot of tea and commences
to recite the cataclysmic prophecies in the Book of
Revelation, from memory, as if they were the multiplication
tables. Black majority rule, he concludes, is the evil coming
to devour white South Africa. "If they {the blacks} kill each
other over a papaw or banana," he says, "then what will be
left of us?"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A few blocks away, Stefanie van den Heever pours pineapple
wine while her husband, Chris, plots the preservation of
white civilization in Africa. A bust of Cicero looks on from
the parlor. "We have fought and paid in blood for our
fatherland," Mr. van den Heever says. "We won't give up the
land of our birth. Never."
   At the Amarula Restaurant, the only diner in town, mayor
and cotton farmer Willie Scheepers attacks his double rump
steak and relates the lesson of Piet Retief, a distant
relative on his mother's side. Mr. Retief and his band of
Afrikaner pioneers were massacred by the Zulus during peace
talks with Dingane, the Zulu king, in 1838. As a gesture of
good faith, the Afrikaners had left their weapons behind.
   "That won't happen again," assures the mayor. He plops his
wife's purse on the table and pulls out a pistol. "She knows
how to use my R-1, too," he says. The R-1 is a standard South
African army rifle.
   Fear and loathing stalk South Africa's conservative
heartland these days. The whirlwind of change that has swept
the country in the past few months has inflamed the passions
of the white right. Pride. Prejudice. Defiance. Desperation.
First came the unbanning of the African National Congress,
then the release of ANC leader Nelson Mandela, then the
beginning of power-sharing talks with the blacks. Now, Mr.
Mandela is triumphantly circling the world, arriving in New
York tomorrow to a ticker-tape parade. As the walls close in
on white-minority rule and the cozy privileges of apartheid,
right-wing emotions, so raw and intense, threaten the "new"
South Africa with a level of racial violence unknown even in
the old one.
   From the wheat fields of the western Transvaal comes the
crackle of guns at a practice session of the Boere Commando,
a group of white vigilantes who would rather go down shooting
than submit to the black majority. From the mining towns of
the Orange Free State come the thundering threats of a "holy
war" by the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. From the
Vortrekker Monument in Pretoria, the sacred shrine of
Afrikanerdom, comes the pounding of 100,000 feet stomping
defiantly at a mass rally called by the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party. A banner held aloft at the gathering
proclaims, "White nationhood is greater than death." From all
across the "platteland" comes the rebellious message: Stop
the reforms, or else.
   President F.W. de Klerk, who began the reforms when he
took over the leadership of the ruling National Party last
year, dismisses threats of resistance and revolt as
"irresponsible, undemocratic and dangerous" and vows not to
be deterred. Yet alarm is spreading through government at the
virulence of the white backlash to Mr. de Klerk's dismantling
of apartheid, the system of racial segregation that his party
created and that he once resolutely defended. Even the ANC,
which has been waging a guerrilla war against white rule for
30 years, recoils at the depth of right-wing emotions. Since
its unbanning, the ANC has been trying to reach out to
whites, including some of the more conservative
organizations, telling them that they have nothing to fear
from majority rule. Mr. Mandela encourages whites to support
Mr. de Klerk's reforms.
   But, says Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's director of foreign
affairs, "Some whites believe they have a divine mission to
destroy the ANC. . . . The closer we get to change in South
Africa, one presumes, the more desperate they will become."
   Yet Mr. de Klerk, himself an Afrikaner, is reluctant to
order a crackdown, fearing that such a move, such as
disarming radical right-wingers, could spark a tribal war
among the whites, setting Afrikaner against Afrikaner. For
the right wing is no mere lunatic fringe, but a significant
slice of the white population -- farmers, miners, factory
foremen, civil servants, policemen, soldiers. For 42 years,
apartheid has been their security blanket. Today, they defy
anyone to take it away.
   "They are our burden, for we have made them what they
are," says Beyers Naude, who has been trying to convert his
fellow whites for the past four decades, first as a maverick
minister in the Dutch Reformed Church and now as a member of
the ANC's negotiating team. "The ideology of apartheid has
been ingrained so deeply, in their outlook, actions and
entire beings. We just can't drop them now. The entire white
community has a responsibility to convince them of their
foolishness."
   The elderly preacher sighs. "It is a tedious process," he
says. "But the only alternative is bloodshed."
   It is harvest time in Marble Hall, the cotton capital of
South Africa. So much fluff has fallen from the wagons on the
way to the gins that the roads seem to be paved in cotton.
Everything is white.
   Marble Hall, located on the plains northeast of Pretoria,
is a bastion of the Conservative Party, the defender of
apartheid and white self-determination. About 3,500 whites
live in Marble Hall, almost all of them Afrikaners. Many are
descended from the Afrikaner pioneers who battled the Zulus
and British for a place they could call their own.
English-speakers are considered "uitlanders," foreigners.
Blacks come into town during the day to work or shop, and by
nightfall they are on their way back to the homelands of
Lebowa and kwaNdebele. This is the ordained neatness of
apartheid.
   There are two cotton gins in town, and a marble mine a few
miles out. (The marble was discovered before the farmers
learned to grow cotton, hence the name, Marble Hall.) Church
spires and grain silos rise above the trees. The houses are
solid brick, the streets are neatly paved, the lawns always
green. The only theater in town is a drive-in. Saturdays are
for rugby. Sundays are for church.
   Marble Hall once was a National Party town -- as was
nearly every white town in the country -- when the National
Party was still the defender of white supremacy. But the
coming change was evident when Willie Scheepers Sr., the
mayor's father, switched his allegiance.
   "I've been National Party from the day I first opened my
eyes," he says. His wife and sons began leaving the party in
1983 when it started tinkering with apartheid by allowing
Indians and coloreds -- people of mixed race -- into
parliament, albeit in separate chambers. For a while, Mr.
Scheepers wouldn't talk politics to any of them. He did vote
for his son when he ran for the city council on the
Conservative Party ticket. But he rooted for the
Nationalists.
   Then, one night last year, he was watching the television
news when he heard a report about Mr. de Klerk's return from
a trip to Europe. "There he was at the airport," Mr.
Scheepers recalls, "and someone asks him about the Group
Areas Act {which segregates neighborhoods}. Well, de Klerk
says it is no longer a factor in South Africa, that it is
almost gone." That did it. The Conservative Party had another
member.
   "All my adult life, I've had a Group Areas Act," says Mr.
Scheepers, who is 69 years old. "It is the white peoples'
guarantee."
   He picks up the National Party's election manifesto of
1988, which he keeps under a lace doily on the coffee table.
Right there, on page two, it says the party's policy "is that
each group {race} should have its own residential areas,
schools, homes for senior citizens. . . ." The Act is still
on the books, but the very notion that the government is now
thinking of scrapping it is treachery enough.
   "They've been lying to us," says Mr. Scheepers, a retired
farmer. He wonders how anyone can trust the government now
when it promises to protect white minority rights in the new
constitution.
   He feels betrayed, bewildered, angry. "My nationalism is
still the same. My belief in God is still the same. My love
of country is still the same," he says. "I haven't changed.
They've changed."
   Since 1948, when it first came to power, the National
Party, along with the Dutch Reformed Church, has told whites
that they have a divine right to rule the country. They
institutionalized racism, made it legal, created an apartheid
theology. It's in the Bible, they said.
   Now, although the government may have decided to negotiate
a new constitution with Mr. Mandela and the church has
repudiated apartheid, to many right-wingers he is still the
same antichrist the government and the church always said he
was. It's right there in the Book of Revelation, they say.
   Around Marble Hall, Mr. de Klerk is commonly viewed as a
traitor and Johan Heyns, the head of the Dutch Reformed
Church, a Communist. In the past two years, nearly 200 adults
have joined the new Afrikaans Protestant Church, which broke
away from the local Dutch Reformed congregation when it began
preaching about integrating the races. Last week construction
began on a new APC church, which will seat 450.
   Over at the van den Heever house, Mr. van den Heever
offers a refill of pineapple wine. "By the way," he says,
smiling broadly, "the most popular video in South Africa
today is the release of Mandela. You just play it backwards."
   The Conservative Party would like to run all the recent
reforms in reverse. It is challenging the government to call
a new general election, claiming that the National Party
doesn't have a mandate for its reforms. But the government
wouldn't dare call an election now -- and it doesn't need to
until 1994 -- because the Conservatives, at this moment,
might well win a majority. In the parliamentary election nine
months ago, before the reforms kicked in, the Conservatives
won 31% of the white vote. Such is the current disaffection
with the National Party.
   Plan B for the Conservatives is to press their demand for
a white homeland, a chunk of South Africa where whites will
be in the majority and they can rule themselves without
interference. The Conservatives may eventually bring that
demand to the negotiations on a new constitution. "But we
won't go into negotiations to discuss our exit from power,"
says Mr. van den Heever, one of the party's strategists. "No
way."
   Both the government and the ANC, however, say the idea of
a white homeland is nonsense and unworthy of negotiation.
But, says Mr. van den Heever, "We know what we want. In some
ways we may look stupid, but, God knows, we aren't."
   One thing they believe with certainty is that
power-sharing with the blacks won't work. "You can't simply
take some power from the whites and give it to the blacks.
They won't be satisfied until they have it all," Mr. van den
Heever says. "The biggest problem facing us is that the black
man doesn't have the discipline to rule himself. . . . Look
at Africa. They just don't get on with it."
   The right-wingers frequently look to the black-ruled
countries north of the Limpopo River and cringe in horror and
fear at the poverty, corruption and tribal warfare. The
lesson they draw is that black rule will similarly impoverish
South Africa.
   "We don't want to be brought down to their standards,"
Mayor Scheepers says.
   Adds Mr. Mallinson: "It's easy to say we'll give South
Africa to Mandela. It's OK if he keeps it up to standards and
my wife and children don't get raped. We just don't want to
be ruled by a bunch of hooligans."
   On the other side of town, beyond the cotton gins and the
citrus groves, Phil and Cornelia De Wet watch the walls close
in from their tobacco farm. They came to South Africa, the
land of their grandparents, in 1963, having left Kenya after
black independence there. In years since, they have watched
the southward migration of whites from Rhodesia (now
Zimbabwe), Mozambique and Angola, as black governments came
to power in those countries. Now, there is no place left to
go. For the whites of Africa, this is the last stop.
   "Life on the farms is getting impossible," says Mr. De
Wet. The other week, his van was stolen from the garage; not
long before, a tractor was taken from the shed. Taxes are
soaring -- mainly, he reckons, to subsidize the black
development. And the blacks are talking ever more loudly
about land redistribution.
   "They'll push us so far and then no more," he says.
   "It's do or die," says his wife.
   The other day, their teen-age son came home from school
with a curious question: Dad, will you capitulate? Replied
the father: "No, I'll fight and die." The son smiled proudly.
   "When I came here from Kenya, I started from scratch,"
says Mr. De Wet. "When the ANC takes over, they'll
nationalize my land, and I'll have nothing again. Well, they
can have it. But, by golly, I'll take a few of them with me."
   He wipes his face, weathered from years in the African
sun. "Mark my words," he says.

   Workplace Panel
   Is Urging Changes
   In Schools, on Job

   WASHINGTON -- Major changes in high-school education and
workplace organization are needed to emphasize higher skills
and greater worker authority over how jobs are done, a work
skills commission said.
   The Commission on the Skills of the American Workplace
said that if both education and work systems aren't revised,
the U.S. will continue losing competitive ground to foreign
nations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most U.S. employers have so far done reasonably well in
meeting foreign competition by using fewer, low-paid workers,
with low skills, the report said. But the focus must switch
to using better-educated, better-trained employees, with more
control over their work, or at least 70% of workers "will see
their dreams slip away," the commission said.
   The commission was formed by the National Center on
Education and the Economy, Rochester, N.Y., which was spun
off from Carnegie Corp. two years ago. Since 1986, the group
has issued reports urging restructuring of U.S. schools and
greater flexibility in federal funding of education for
disadvantaged youths.
   One company that already follows the high-skill, employee
"empowerment" approach is International Business Machines
Corp., the report said. When managers at IBM's Austin, Texas,
factory that supplies circuit boards for personal computers
said they could save $60 million by buying boards elsewhere,
IBM had other ideas.
   Because it pursues a full-employment, no-layoff policy,
managers instead cut costs by upgrading worker skills, the
report said. They organized workers into teams, giving each
responsibility for its own inspection, repairs and materials
ordering. Workers who had performed such indirect tasks were
assigned to production teams, and far fewer indirect
employees were needed.
   Job classifications were changed, reorganizing
manufacturing slots into categories with rising skill
requirements, the report said. Education and training
programs were launched; the plant now spends more than 5% of
its payroll to teach workers.
   According to the report, IBM says that the $60 million gap
has been closed. Productivity is up by more than 200%,
quality is five times better, and the inventory has been cut
40%. Production has risen 600%, and the plant employs more
people than ever.
   The Austin experience is a good example of what IBM has
been doing in the U.S. and abroad, Walton Burdick, senior
vice president for personnel, said in an interview. In both
manufacturing and service jobs, the aim is to "unleash more
of {workers'} innovative and creative" powers, he said.
   With more employee involvement in workplace functions such
as ordering supplies, setting schedules, keeping quality
records, maintenance and problem-solving, morale is higher
and productivity climbs, Mr. Burdick said.
   By contrast, the commission said "the vast majority" of
U.S. employers aren't moving to "high performance" work
organization, which requires educated workers, nor investing
to train employees. Fully $27 billion of the $30 billion in
annual training outlays is spent by 15,000 companies, only
0.5% of all U.S. companies, and fewer than 200 of these
employers -- large companies with significant professional
and managerial staff -- spend more than 2% of their payroll
on formal training, the report said.
   The commission is headed by Ira Magaziner, a consultant in
Providence, R.I., and by William Brock and Ray Marshall,
former U.S. labor secretaries. The study involved
interviewing 400 U.S. companies and comparing school and
workplace programs in six foreign nations with those in six
states. The commission recommended:
   -- A new high-level educational performance standard
should be set for high schools, and made a requirement to be
met by age 16.
   -- States should assure that nearly all students obtain a
certificate that they've met this standard. With federal aid,
they should also create alternative learning programs for
those who cannot reach the initial standard in regular
schools, and use youth centers to enroll school dropouts.
Youths shouldn't be allowed to work before age 18 unless
they've achieved the certificate or are enrolled in a program
toward it.
   -- A thorough system of technical and professional
education should be instituted for non-college-bound high
school graduates. Specific occupational skills should be
combined with general education.
   "Because we have failed to forge a relationship between
how well a student does in school and what kind of job he or
she can get, we have turned our high schools into little more
than holding tanks for non-college-bound students," Mr.
Marshall said.
   -- Employers should be given incentives and assistance to
invest in further education and training of their workers,
and to pursue workplace methods aimed at high productivity.
All companies would have to contribute at least 1% for
education and training.
   -- Employment and training boards should be set up by the
federal government and states, to help employers define their
worker skill needs, give workers access to training and help
local governments and others plan effective labor-market
programs.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices plunged in thin trading,
suggesting to some analysts that the market has sopped up as
much cash as portfolio managers are willing to commit before
the quarter ends.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.71 points to
close at 2882.18. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell
three-eighths of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 of face
amount, in weak trading. The dollar sagged against most major
currencies amid rumors of a European move to let the dollar
weaken.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Institutional investors weren't big stock sellers, but the
steep drop suggested investors are less enthralled with
certain assumptions that have helped drive the market to
records -- particularly expectations of improving corporate
earnings and falling interest rates.
   "The amount and intensity of selling did not warrant a
50-point decline," says market strategist Laszlo Birinyi, of
Birinyi Associates Inc. By his calculations, only about $21.2
million flowed out of the New York Stock Exchange in trades
of less than 10,000 shares, which Mr. Birinyi doesn't
consider a strong signal of an impending market decline.
Selling pressure didn't push prices lower so much as did the
absence of buyers, he says.
   One unabashedly bearish market strategist, Abby Joseph
Cohen of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research, isn't surprised the
buyers stayed home. "People simply have run out of reasons to
buy," she says.
   But while Mrs. Cohen thinks the drop is merely a foretaste
of as much as a 25% drop in stock prices, Mr. Birinyi sees
the market making no major moves either up or down for a
while; but then it will head higher on the next piece of good
news.
   To detect changes in the direction of the market, Mr.
Birinyi watches money flow in and out of the Big Board. He
focuses on the dollar amounts of "non-block" trades under
10,000 shares each. He thinks such trades tend to set prices,
making them a more accurate measure of price moves.
   After Jan. 2 of this year, for example, when the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was heading lower, the net money flow into
the market was flat at first and then turned sharply higher
just before the market itself started rising. The money
inflows, and the industrials, have been rising fairly
steadily ever since.
   The time to watch for a market downturn, Mr. Birinyi says,
is when the Dow Jones industrials keep rising while money
starts flowing out of the market. That hasn't happened yet,
he says.
   James Solloway, chief economist at Argus Research, saw the
decline as "some residual disappointments to last week's
news." Hopes that the Federal Reserve Board may ease interest
rates soon are fading because of strength in the industrial
sector, he says, and some companies signaled disappointing
earnings.
   The drop in bond prices also appeared to be continuing
fallout from this past week's economic news. The dollar fell
on unconfirmed rumors that some European central banks wanted
to abandon a 1987 stabilization agreement.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices plunged in anemic trading of 133.5 million
shares on the Big Board.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.46%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6758 marks and 153.66 yen, compared with
1.6875 marks and 153.90 yen Friday.

   First Executive's
   Chief Officer Spars
   With House Panel

   WASHINGTON -- First Executive Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive officer, Fred Carr, sparred for three hours with a
House panel in what apparently was an effort by lawmakers to
get him on the record for future testimony by junk-bond king
Michael Milken.
   Mr. Carr was grilled about his relationships with Mr.
Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier who
this year pleaded guilty to six felony counts. Oversight and
Investigations Subcommittee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich)
also asked Mr. Carr a series of specific questions about
First Executive's relationship with convicted arbitrager Ivan
Boesky and others.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Messrs. Milken and Boesky are likely to appear before the
subcommittee later this year in its probe of the junk-bond
industry.
   But Mr. Carr, adding phrases such as "I'm not certain but
. . ." or "I believe," parried the assaults and offered
repeated arguments for junk bonds and First Executive's
investment strategy. "I believe that in the long-term . . .
our investment strategy will be proven to be sound," he said.
First Executive holds billions of dollars of junk bonds and
has aggressively built its business using the high-yield,
high-risk securities.
   The responses didn't appear to sit well with Rep. Dingell,
who wanted specific answers to questions about First
Executive's relationship to First Stratford Corp., a
Delaware-based reinsurance company that is partly owned by
Mr. Milken. First Executive owns 46% of First Stratford, as
does a company controlled by Mr. Milken.
   Mr. Carr told the panel that he remembered no conversation
later than 1981 with Mr. Milken about reinsurance, which
allows insurance companies to transfer risk to a third party.
"Don't people wonder who they're getting in bed with?" Mr.
Dingell asked, adding that First Stratford holders must be
"remarkably trusting and happy people."
   Then Mr. Dingell led Mr. Carr through a series of
questions about Fischbach Corp., Stone Container Corp. and
Harris Graphics Corp. All three have been linked to Mr.
Boesky and Mr. Milken, and First Executive has invested in
the three companies. Mr. Carr patiently answered the queries,
contending in part that "I have never received any assurances
or guarantees from Mr. Milken" on any of the deals.
   Mr. Carr insisted that Mr. Milken was never involved in
any investment decisions of First Executive. Instead, Mr.
Carr explained that the company invested in junk bonds
because of their higher returns that more than compensated
for a higher default rate.
   Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said "there seems to be two
worlds at First Executive -- one for {executives} and the
other for policyholders." He cited a contract that Mr. Carr
recently received that includes a provision that would pay
the executive $6 million if he leaves because of a change of
control within three years.

   U.S. Concerns Won't Need
   Licenses for Shipments
   Beginning in Early July

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department announced that
starting in early July it will allow U.S. exporters to ship
all but the most sensitive high-technology goods to major
U.S. allies without first obtaining licenses.
   Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said the change will obviate 20,000 export
licenses a year and help speed up deliveries of $30 billion
in annual shipments to America's best high-tech customers.
"This means giving U.S. businesses an even better chance to
compete in the international marketplace," he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new rule will free exports of most computers,
semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, precision instruments,
telecommunications equipment and other high-technology
products from licensing requirements.
   The department said it will maintain existing licensing
requirements for shipments of some critical items, such as
supercomputers, X-ray lithography systems, certain underwater
sensing equipment and cryptographic devices. The new rule,
nonetheless, brings the U.S. and the 16 affected allied
countries a step closer to creating what their authorities
call a "license-free zone" within their borders. All the
countries belong to the Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls, which oversees joint efforts to
keep sensitive technology out of the hands of potential
adversaries.
   The relaxation in licensing requirements is designed to
eliminate a disadvantage U.S. exporters face in trade within
Cocom; currently, they have to plow through more paper work
than their competitors in Japan or Western Europe.
   The rule doesn't eliminate all paper work; exporters still
will be required to maintain some records in case authorities
decide they need it. But the department said it might end
even the remaining restrictions within a year if all the
Cocom members agree to raise their standards for enforcing
export controls to a common level. Mr. Kloske said Cocom has
set an April 30, 1991, deadline for completing this task.
   The Commerce Department action comes on the heels of
Cocom's decision earlier this month to release previously
controlled Western technology to the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe. Despite that relaxation, the U.S. is trying to get
the other Cocom members to agree to uniform licensing
requirements for shipping the most strategically sensitive
goods among Cocom members. The Commerce Department commended
Japan, Canada, Norway and Australia for agreeing to follow
the U.S. lead.
   The U.S. still requires licenses for shipments of certain
items even to Cocom destinations because they are considered
high-risk targets for illegal acquisition by the Soviet Union
or by Third World countries with clandestine programs to
build nuclear devices or ballistic missiles. Moreover, the
department said it will maintain existing controls on
shipments of chemical and biological weapons. Also unchanged
is the current U.S. practice of requiring buyers in other
Cocom countries to apply for re-export licenses before
shipping licensed U.S. products to other countries.

   AMSOUTH Bancorp. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
lowered its debt ratings on this banking company. The rating
agency also said it downgraded its rating of AmSouth Bank --
the Birmingham, Ala., company's lead bank -- for long-term
deposits. The changes affect about $123 million in long-term
debt. The rating service said the changes reflect uncertainty
about the performance of AmSouth's commercial real estate
portfolio. Moody's said, however, that the performance, asset
quality and capital support of the company's core businesses
should continue to support AmSouth's dominant position in
Alabama. The following ratings were lowered: AmSouth Bancorp.
floating-rate notes to single-A-2 from single-A-1;
subordinated capital notes to single-A-3 from single-A-2. The
Prime-1 rating of the company for commercial paper was

   SALANT Corp. -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered
its rating on $75 million of this apparel company's senior
subordinated notes to D from triple-C-plus. The rating
concern cited Salant's obligation to suspend interest
payments on the public debt until the company cures a default
on $10.8 million of bank debt. Last week, Salant, which
emerged from bankruptcy court three years ago, said it may
again make a Chapter 11 filing, among other options; under
Chapter 11, a company operates with protection from
creditors' lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay
or settle debts. Salant, which owns Manhattan Industries Inc.
and Denton Mills Inc., last week said that, in addition to
defaulting on the payment of interest and principal, it had
failed to comply with certain covenants in its credit
agreements with its bank lenders. And Salant said it wasn't
able to make an interest payment of $1.9 million on a
different issue of senior subordinated notes. That issue
isn't rated, an S&amp;P spokeswoman said.

   SOUTHTRUST Corp. (Birmingham, Ala.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its long-term debt ratings for
this bank holding company and the rating for commercial
paper. Moody's also said the rating for long-term deposits of
SouthTrust Bank of Alabama, a subsidiary, was downgraded. The
changes affect about $105 million of long-term debt. The
rating service said the moves reflect the potential for
deterioration in SouthTrust's commercial real estate
portfolio. Moody's noted, however, that SouthTrust remains
profitable and well-capitalized. The following ratings are
affected: For SouthTrust Corp. -- senior debentures, to
single-A-3 from single-A-1; subordinated capital notes, to
Baa-1 from single-A-2; and commercial paper, to Prime-2 from
Prime-1. For SouthTrust Bank of Alabama -- long-term deposits
to single-A-1 from double-A-3. The Prime-1 rating of the bank
for short-term obligations is unchanged.

   UNITED MERCHANTS &amp; MANUFACTURERS Inc. (New York) --
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it downgraded its rating on this

Friday on its 13 3/4% senior subordinated notes, due 2000;
the debt outstanding totals $116 million. The company is
seeking to restructure its debt. Barring operating
improvements and a meaningful debt restructuring, United
Merchants' long-term viability is questionable, S&amp;P, a rating
concern, said.

   Dancing princesses who live at the bottom of a well. A
house with no floors, where guests must travel by rope from
room to room. A city that has freed itself from the laws of
gravity and circles the earth at leisure. They may sound
vaguely like fairy tales we've heard before, but they are
brand-new, used with startling effectiveness by Jeanette
Winterson in her new novel, "Sexing the Cherry" (Atlantic
Monthly Press, 167 pages, $19.95).
   Ms. Winterson is a young British writer whose last novel,
"Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit" (1985), was about a lesbian
orphan who is raised by fundamentalists. Provocative material
and an interest in fruit seem to be this author's
specialties. For provocation, "Sexing the Cherry" has plenty
of feminist revisionism and sexual violence; as for fruit, it
has descriptions of the first grafted cherry tree and the
first pineapple ever seen in England.

   We are in London, in the year 1630, "a foul place, full of
pestilence and rot." A foundling is fished out of the rancid
Thames by a woman of freak-show proportions, with caves in
her face large enough to house fleas. She lives with "fifty
dogs and no company but her own," for she has a habit of
causing grave reproductive damage to any man who gets near
her. Yet the Dog-Woman, as she is known, raises the child she
has named Jordan very tenderly. At age 10 Jordan meets John
Tradescant, gardener to the king, who takes the boy as his
apprentice to design a great garden for the queen.
   These are tough times for royalty, though, for this is the
era of the Civil War, when a Parliament full of Puritans and
their leader, Oliver Cromwell, are fighting to overthrow the
king. Eventually, in 1649, King Charles is put on trial and
condemned to death. Jordan, now 19, escapes with Tradescant
to sail around the world in search of exotic plants.
   Meanwhile the Dog-Woman resolves to avenge the king's
murder. She goes around London killing Puritans and
collecting their teeth and eyeballs in a sack. The
Dog-Woman's fellow Royalists are dismayed by this literal
interpretation of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth," but she remains unperturbed, saying that "bodies mean
nothing to me, dead or alive. I would cry for my dogs and my
boy but the rest may vanish as they please."
   During Jordan's travels, he stays as a guest in a
mysterious house with no floors. There he glimpses a dancer
escaping from her window by moonlight on a thin rope. Jordan
sets out in search of the dancer, disguising himself as a
woman, and tracks down her 11 sisters, dancing princesses who
tell him stories about the various ways they killed their
husbands. At last Jordan finds the 12th dancer on an island
that exists "sideways in time," and he spends a month with
her before joining Tradescant again.
   In 1661 Jordan returns to London, bringing with him the
first pineapple ever to reach England. Tradescant is dead,
and so is Cromwell; Charles II has taken power. Jordan leaves
again to discover more uncharted territory, more exotic
fruits. Then, suddenly, we slip "sideways in time," to London
in 1990, where Jordan and the Dog-Woman are reincarnated as
contemporary Londoners.
   Here the novel abruptly loses its convoluted charm,
turning into a glum lecture about modern-day political
corruption, the nuclear threat and environmental hazards.
Then, ending with a bitter portent of apocalypse, it skips
back once more to the 17th-century to recall the ravaging of
London by plague and fire in 1666.
   In its combination of history and myth, "Sexing the
Cherry" covers a lot of ground in its 150-odd pages. But Ms.
Winterson is using history and myth for her own very
deliberate purposes. Those dancing princesses who murder
their husbands, that Dog-Woman who dismembers the members of
Parliament, the hero who dresses as a woman: It's clear that
this novel is a feminist power fantasy dressed up as a fairy
tale. Ms. Winterson's deceptively simple prose has echoes of
many literary forebears, all radical innovators in their
time: Dante, Rabelais, Defoe, Swift, Calvino, Garcia Marquez.
But all of these writers were male, and Ms. Winterson's
objective is to claim their territory on behalf of womankind.
Hers is a work of feminist imperialism that manages somehow
to be alarmingly destructive and enchantingly creative at the
same time.
   On another level altogether is the American writer Laurie
Colwin's new novel, "Goodbye Without Leaving" (Poseidon, 253
pages, $18.95). If Ms. Winterson's book strives for the
proportions of an epic, Ms. Colwin's is the prose equivalent
of light verse. Geraldine Coleshares, an aimless graduate
student, lands her dream job: as the only white backup singer
for Vernon and Ruby Shakely and the Shakettes. But her glory
days don't last long. Before she knows it, she is married to
a nice lawyer and about to have a baby.
   Geraldine has only two emotions: astonishment at her
sudden maturity and gushy love for her husband and newborn
son. Beyond this, neither she nor any of the other characters
seem to have much life at all. This is because Ms. Colwin
offers lots of slick observations about their experience, but
never adequately describes the experience itself. Some titles
from Ms. Colwin's previous novels give hints of the cheerful
banality to be found in her new book: "Happy All the Time,"
"Family Happiness," "Another Marvelous Thing." "Goodbye
Without Leaving" is as fatuously benign as "Sexing the
Cherry" is subversive and powerful.

   Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's Stories From India Reissued
   ----
   By Merle Rubin

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A18

<LP>
   Talking about contemporary writers, Dame Rebecca West once
mentioned that one of her favorites was "that Polish woman
with the Indian name who lives in New York."
   Well, that in a nutshell pretty much describes Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala, whose 10 novels Simon &amp; Schuster has now finished
reprinting in paperback. A more prolix biographer might also
add that she was born in 1927 to Polish Jewish parents, came
to England as a refugee in 1939, attended London University,
and then moved in 1951 to India with her husband, the Indian
architect C.S.H. Jhabvala, before heading for New York 24
years later.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Along the way, she won the Booker Prize for her novel
"Heat and Dust," and an Academy Award for "A Room With a
View," one of the numerous intelligent screen adaptations
she's written for her good friends, the producer-director
team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory.
   From her first novel, "Amrita" (1955), a tale of forbidden
love, to her most recent, "Three Continents" (1987), a
satiric look at wealthy Westerners and their guru, India has
furnished the background and inspiration for all but one of
Ms. Jhabvala's novels. ("The Search of Love and Beauty" was
set in America.)
   Unlike many other Westerners fascinated with India,
however, Ms. Jhabvala claims she never was drawn there by its
mysticism. "If I hadn't married an Indian," she once wrote,
"I don't think I would ever have come here." A social realist
in the tradition of Jane Austen, Thackeray and Henry James
(whose "The Bostonians" she adapted for the screen), Ms.
Jhabvala turns a cooly rational eye on mysticism and
materialism alike, mocking the follies and pretensions of her
characters while maintaining a strong undercurrent of empathy
with their plights.
   All this is evident in the last three novels now available
in paperback: They fully display the characteristic strengths
of her style and vision. "The Nature of Passion" (1956), her
second novel, is a classic story of generational conflict.
Lalaji, a rich New Delhi contractor, wants only the best for
his children. Three of them are settled, and his docile
middle daughter is content -- nay, downright eager -- to be
married off in the traditional, parent-arranged fashion. But
the youngest son and daughter are defiantly, petulantly
modern. The rashness of youth, however, is no match for the
wisdom and patience of maturity, and everything works out,
perhaps a little too neatly, in this nonetheless satisfying
novel.
   The cultural and generational conflicts safely contained
in "The Nature of Passion" take a more dangerous turn in Ms.
Jhabvala's next novel, "Esmond in India" (1958). Two Indian
families, bound by ties of friendship (and a shared history
of participation in the civil-disobedience campaign that led
to Indian independence) hope to repair the slight breach that
occurred when the daughter of one refused to marry the son of
the other. She chose instead to marry an Englishman, Esmond
Stillwood. An expert on Indian literature, Stillwood has come
to loathe his beautiful, uneducated Indian wife and almost
everything about India, including the way that his little son
seems more and more Indian every day.
   But this does not diminish his appeal in the eyes of
Shakuntala, sister of the man spurned by Esmond's unhappy
wife. A modern, college-educated young woman, Shakuntala sees
in Esmond all the romance and poetry of the West. This is a
subtler, more disturbing novel than its predecessor. The
characters are more carefully fleshed out, yet are all the
more inexorably entrapped by their own strong emotions and
powerful misconceptions.
   In "A Backward Place" (1965), her sixth novel, Ms.
Jhabvala focuses on European expatriates. Judy, the heroine,
is a lower-middle-class Englishwoman whose marriage to Bal, a
handsome unemployed Indian actor, has provided a way out of
her drab background. She, Bal and their two children share
cramped quarters with his extended family, and while she
struggles to make ends meet, working as a secretary, he hangs
out at coffeehouses, dreaming of stardom. Etta, an
acid-tongued Hungarian, urges Judy to leave this "backward
place," while pseudo-artistic Clarissa enthuses mindlessly
over all things Indian.
   The contrasting pretensions of Judy's two friends make for
delicious high (and occasionally broad) comedy that balances
the pathos, not only of Judy's plight, but even of Etta's and
Clarissa's: Being more self-deluded, they actually are more
"trapped" in "a backward place" than the seemingly less
fortunate Judy.
   Writing in the tradition of British social comedy, Ms.
Jhabvala -- like Henry James -- has expanded its range beyond
the country village, the suburb, the drawing rooms of a
clearly established social order, and demonstrated its
continuing viability and vitality amid a larger, less stable
world of crumbling social structures, displaced people, and
the fairly constant human tendency to delude ourselves.

   MCLEAN, Va. -- GTE Spacenet and a Mexican
telecommunications firm agreed to jointly provide data, voice
and broadcast communications services via satellite between
the U.S. and Mexico.
   The services are separate from those provided by
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or
Intelsat, a satellite-services provider owned by about 119
countries, excluding the Soviet Union and its allies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   GTE Spacenet said, however, that Intelsat has approved
this new agreement, signed with Telecomunicaciones de Mexico.
GTE Spacenet is a unit of GTE Corp., the Stamford, Conn.,
telecommunications, lighting and precision-materials company.
   The operation with the Mexican firm will allow a company
with a private communications network to extend the network
into Mexico, allowing the company to send messages directly
from office to office, said Raymond Marks, GTE Spacenet's
vice president of marketing and business development. In
contrast, Intelsat transmits a company's messages to a
Mexican Intelsat station, which then transmits the message to
the company's local office.
   Additionally, Mr. Marks said that Intelsat hasn't been
able to provide uniform levels of service for all regions of
both countries.
   The new service doesn't directly compete with Intelsat,
which largely routes public transmissions, such as consumer
phone calls and network TV.

   Industrial Stocks Close 53.71 Lower
   As Hopes Dim for Drop in Rates

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Stock prices posted their steepest declines in
almost five months as a dimming of hopes for lower interest
rates and flurries of futures-related selling took their toll
on the market.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 53.71 to 2882.18
as blue-chip issues ran into selling in the aftermath of
Friday's quarterly expiration of stock-index futures and
options.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With the help of buying stemming from the expiration, the
industrial average ended last week by setting its 11th
all-time high since mid-May. But the average followed up that
performance by posting its sharpest point loss since Jan. 22,
when it skidded 77.45 points.
   "The market was certainly overdue for a little bit of a
break," said Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. Selling among investors looking to take profits
after the earlier runup helped set the decline in motion,
traders said.
   Index-arbitrage sell programs, involving the sale of
baskets of stocks and the purchase of index-futures contracts
to profit from price differences between the two, battered
the market several times during the session. A late flurry of
arbitrage selling helped send prices skidding to session lows
at the close.
   Declining stocks routed advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange by 1,230 to 353. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
skidded 6.03 to 356.88, while the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 2.93 to 194.93 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index lost 5.15 to 332.50.
   Trading activity, which swelled Friday as a result of the
quarterly expiration, slowed to a sluggish pace. Just
133,470,000 shares were traded on the Big Board, compared
with 205,130,000 Friday.
   Investors who had been anticipating a move by the Federal
Reserve to ease monetary policy began backing away from that
view Friday after the report on May industrial production,
which went up 0.6%, proved better than expected.
   Further weakness in the bond market, where Treasury issues
had fallen sharply Friday in the wake of the production
report and other economic data, was also cited as a factor
hurting stocks. In late trading yesterday, Treasury notes and
bonds were posting losses of as much as 3/8 point, or $3.75
per $1,000 face amount.
   At record levels, the stock market wasn't prepared to
weather that kind of disappointment, analysts said. "This
market has been driven by sentiment more than anything else,"
said Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Another problem at this point, Mr. Clough said, is that
investors appear to have become focused more sharply on
growth stocks amid nervousness about corporate earnings, to
the detriment of the overall market.
   "The market's tendency has been to chase a few stocks to
levels which are, by historical measures, pretty high," he
said, adding that his firm's comparison of earnings and
dividend yields on stocks to the yield on the benchmark
30-year Treasury bonds shows that stocks had become 15% to
20% overvalued.
   Boeing, a blue-chip issue that has been a favorite among
investors recently because of strong commercial orders for
its planes, fell 1 1/8 to 59 on Big Board composite volume of
1.2 million shares. Among other actively traded blue chips,
International Business Machines lost 1 5/8 to 118 3/4, Philip
Morris dropped 1 1/4 to 42 3/4, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph slid 7/8 to 41 7/8 and General Electric fell 1 to
69 1/8.
   Compaq Computer plunged 4 3/8 to 123 5/8 amid the
company's introduction of new laptop and desktop computers,
which had been expected. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., citing the
stock's previous advance to its price target of $125 to $130
a share, removed it from the firm's recommended list.
   Chrysler rose 3/8 to 15 1/2 on 1.1 million shares on a
published report that the auto maker and Fiat of Italy may be
pursuing an alliance, ranging from a broad international
marketing deal to a merger. Chrysler declined to comment.
   Selling accelerated in Southeast Banking, the Big Board's
most active issue, which fell 3/4 to 10 1/2 as 1.6 million
shares changed hands. The stock had tumbled 2 5/8 points
Friday after the company projected losses for the second
quarter and year and reduced its dividend.
   Global Marine dropped 1/2 to 4 3/8 on 1.5 million shares.
Norsk Vikingolje, a Norwegian investment and oil-drilling
concern, disclosed that it had lowered its stake in the
company by about one-third, to 4.4%.
   Also, Barron's magazine reported that Michael Katz, a
money manager who specializes in selling stocks short,
considers Global Marine to be one of his three current
favorites for short sales. The others are Stone Container,
which fell 1 3/4 to 17 3/4, and Cablevision Systems, whose
Class A shares dropped 1 to 29 1/8.
   Plum Creek Timber plunged 2 5/8 to 25 1/4 after this
newspaper reported that the partnership's logging practices
-- including the felling of forests at a faster pace than
they can be regenerated -- have become a source of
controversy in the Pacific Northwest.
   UAL lost 2 1/8 to 155 5/8. This paper reported that the
26,000 non-union workers at UAL, the owner of United
Airlines, may oppose the planned buy-out by its three major
unions.
   Businessland fell 1/2 to 8 1/4 after dismissing its top
two marketing and sales executives, a move that reflects
management's concern with the company's performance in the
two areas.
   Scott Paper gained 1 to 47 as analysts responded favorably
to news of the company's plans to acquire a 51% stake in the
sanitary tissue operations of Feldmuhle, a West German
concern, through a joint venture. George Adler, an analyst at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham, said the venture is "important
strategically."
   Medtronic, which won a round before the Supreme Court in a
patent-infringement dispute with Eli Lilly, rose 1/8 to 79
3/8. The court ruled a company may defend itself against
infringement charges by showing that it used a patented
medical device solely to gather data for the Food and Drug
Administration. Lilly slid 1 1/2 to 76 1/2.
   Carter-Wallace added 1/2 to 53 after a favorable report in
Barron's, which noted that the company has been stepping up
its research effort and keeping an eye out for acquisitions
while maintaining strong financial performance.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 3.27
to 360.76. Volume totaled 11,010,000 shares.
   Home Shopping Network slid 1/2 to 8 1/4. The company
posted net income of four cents a share for its fiscal third
quarter, compared with a year-ago loss; analysts had expected
slightly better results.

   Announces Layoffs

   NEW YORK -- Bankers Trust New York Corp. said it laid off
75 employees in its flagship bank's corporate finance
department, reflecting the slump in mergers and acquisitions.
   The layoffs, which represent about 10% of the corporate
finance department's professional staff, cut across all lines
of business and include not just New York, but also regional
offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles, said
Ralph L. MacDonald Jr., managing director and head of the
corporate finance department. He said the staff reductions
will save about $10 million annually.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Additionally, Mr. MacDonald said Bankers Trust created two
new units -- a corporate finance group and a banking and
finance group -- to advise corporate clients on methods of
restructuring and financing. The corporate finance group will
act as advisers to senior corporate clients on such matters
as strategic restructuring and mergers, while the banking and
finance group concentrates on specific methods for financing
corporate clients.
   Mr. MacDonald said the changes and layoffs "recognize that
the volume and form of corporate finance restructuring will
be driven primarily by strategic rather than financial
considerations in . . . the '90s." Although total volume of
such transactions clearly has slowed, he said global
competition will continue to force companies here and abroad
to become more efficient.
   "Financial institutions that will be successful in this
new environment will be characterized by both leaner staffing
and a greater emphasis on relationships with senior corporate
managers," he said. He conceded that Bankers Trust hadn't
done as much to cement relationships with corporate clients
as it might have and that the reorganization is aimed at
increasing the company's commitment to its corporate clients.
   Bankers Trust isn't alone in trying to cope with reduced
restructuring and merger activity. Most investment banks and
money center banks that participated in the merger mania of
the late 1980s, building expensive teams of talented
dealmakers, now are struggling for pieces of a much smaller
pie. According to Securities Data Co., the value of domestic
mergers and acquisitions in the first quarter of 1990 totaled
$49.7 billion, less than half the $102.6 billion in deals
announced in the first quarter of 1989.

   Each State Can Limit Re-Election to Congress

   The grass-roots campaign to limit congressional terms
would have a better chance of deserved success if it shifted
its focus from trying to obtain a constitutional amendment to
persuading individual states to limit the number of
consecutive terms a senator or representative from that state
can serve in Congress. Contrary to popular misconception, it
already is in each state's power to take this unilateral
action to restore responsive democracy to its own
congressional elections.
   In recent elections, a trend has been established; in the
1988 elections, 98.5% of all House and 85.7% of all Senate
incumbents who chose to run again were re-elected. As a
result, congressional incumbents increasingly run unopposed.
This year four U.S. senators have no major-party opponent. As
a practical matter nowadays, once an individual enters
Congress, he obtains a lifetime appointment and is insulated
from the electorate. Recent polls show that voters are more
than 2-to-1 in favor of limiting congressional tenure by law.
(Not surprisingly, members of Congress are more than 2-to-1
opposed to the idea.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Responding to this erosion of competitive democracy by
Congress, a movement has begun in many states to adopt a
constitutional amendment to limit the tenure of U.S. senators
and representatives to 12 years. The goal is admirable, but
getting an amendment passed would be very difficult. Since
members of Congress obviously will not propose an amendment
to fire themselves every 12 years, two-thirds of the states
would have to call for a constitutional convention to write
the amendment without congressional approval, and then
three-quarters of the states would have to approve it.
Obviously, these supermajorities are hard to achieve in
theory, and in practice the Constitution has never been
amended in this manner.
   However, a little-known alternative already exists in the
Constitution and is now being promoted by Terry Considine, a
Colorado state senator. Article I, Section 4, reprinted
nearby, has never been used by the states to limit the right
of a congressional incumbent to stand for re-election, which
may be the reason that some mistakenly assume that such
limitations can be enacted only by constitutional amendment
(see accompanying blurb -- WSJ June 19, 1990). But this
provision has been extensively used by the states to regulate
congressional elections, and its breadth has been clearly
established by an extensive array of Supreme Court cases.
   State laws regulating elections have been challenged on
the grounds that they violate either of two constitutional
rights. That is, if they violate either the First Amendment
guarantee of freedom of speech or the 14th Amendment
guarantee of equal protection, then the election regulations
are open to attack. State election laws have fallen on these
grounds when they are shown to be tools of racism,
suppressive of minority political views, discriminatory
against poor people, or just contrary to a fair and open
democracy.
   Therefore, state election laws have been defeated that
require voters to pay poll taxes, pass literacy tests, or own
property. Also, various schemes for drawing election
districts have been defeated on these grounds, including
districting that fails the "one-person-one-vote" test, and
at-large districting for city councils. Also, efforts to
restrict candidates, as opposed to voters, have been defeated
where they require filing fees for candidates, since that
prejudices poor candidates.
   More to the point, however, state laws restricting
candidates from standing for election have withstood
constitutional challenge under the First and 14th amendments.
The Supreme Court has ruled that independent and minor-party
candidates can be kept off the ballot under certain
circumstances, and that minimum residency requirements for
candidates are permissible. Most important, in a 1982 Supreme
Court case, Clements v. Fashing, it was held that individuals
can be prevented from running for office if they are
incumbents in certain other elected offices.
   The facts of Clements are a bit different than restricting
incumbents in Congress from running for re-election, but the
case establishes the constitutional analysis for
anti-incumbent laws. In Clements, Texas laws prohibited
incumbents in certain state offices from running for certain
other state offices. An incumbent challenged the laws on the
grounds that they violated the First and 14th amendments.
   The Supreme Court upheld the state laws. It believed that
the voters' freedom of speech was not denied because they
could vote for another candidate of the same mind, and that
the candidate's freedom of speech was not denied because he
could speak, vote and act politically in any way, except
running for the proscribed offices at that time. On the
equal-protection issue, the court believed that the state had
a legitimate interest in regulating the integrity of its
elections and representation, and that no heightened scrutiny
was required because no fundamental right was denied. That
is, the court believed there is no inherent individual right
in the Constitution to stand as a candidate.
   The best legal attack on state limits to congressional
elections appears to be by Article I, Sections 2 and 3 of the
Constitution. These two sections set out qualifications for
representatives and senators, respectively. State laws
restricting candidates for congressional elections have been
attacked from time to time on the ground that they actually
set out additional qualifications for such candidates,
improperly adding to these two sections of the Constitution.
State courts have sometimes agreed with such arguments, but
the leading federal cases reject the argument.
   In 1974, in Storer v. Brown, the Supreme Court upheld a
California law that prohibited independent candidates in
congressional races who had changed to independent status
from a party affiliation within 11 months of the election.
This was found not to be a void additional qualification
because a valid state interest was pursued. In explaining
this state interest, the court said that "there must be a
substantial regulation {by the states} of elections if they
are to be fair and honest" and that the states' regulation
under the Constitution of "the times, places, and manner" of
their congressional elections may include "the qualifications
of candidates." This is necessary to pursue "the various
routes {of candidates} to the ballot."
   Furthermore, this electoral process, if properly regulated
must have competition of ideas, parties and individual
candidates. It is only by this process that "the winner in
the general election . . . {earns} sufficient support to
govern effectively." Obviously, where the incumbent is the
pre-ordained winner in congressional elections, there is no
such competition, earned support and effective government.
   The ruling in Storer as applied in a 1974 case in federal
district court in Pennsylvania to keep a congressional
incumbent off the general ballot. In Williams v. Tucker, a
House incumbent was defeated for re-election in a party
primary, and then was prevented by state law from running on
the general ballot for re-election as an independent. The
court found that states can restrict access of congressional
incumbents to the ballot, by using one-year waiting periods
before running for re-election, in order to pursue the Storer
state interest in an effective election process.
   Two later federal cases get even more to the point in
reviewing state laws that prohibit certain incumbents from
running for Congress. In the 1980 case, Signorelli v. Evans,
the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York found that a New York
law requiring any state judge to resign before running for
Congress was not an additional qualification because of the
state interest in protecting the integrity of its own
representation. In the 1983 case, Joyner v. Mofford, the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Arizona upheld a law that provided that
no state-office incumbent could run for Congress. This was
found not to be an additional qualification because the state
incumbent was not barred from running for Congress (he only
had to resign from his current state office to run, or he
could just wait for the next congressional election). The
Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal.
   The thrust of these cases is that the actions of a
democratically elected state government will not be
frustrated by the "no additional qualifications" clauses, if
the state limits candidates for its congressional races in a
way that does not offend freedom of speech or equal
protection and that pursues some state interest.
   A state law restricting an incumbent in Congress from
merely succeeding himself in that office after a number of
years would pass these tests.
   The cases about Article I, Section 4 and state regulation
of congressional elections present a consistent philosophy.
To paraphrase Harvard law professor Lawrence Tribe in his
book on constitutional law, candidate restrictions are not
reviewed as strictly as voter registration restrictions,
because most candidate restrictions are designed largely to
protect the electorate from its own shortsightedness.
Furthermore, the capacity to displace incumbents seeking
re-election in favor of the new representatives of a recently
coalesced majority is essential to a democratic system.
   Few prospects are more antithetical to rule by the people
than a temporary majority entrenching itself by cleverly
manipulating the system through which voters, in theory, can
register their dissatisfaction by choosing new leaders.
Hence, the rigor of judicial review of election laws is
proportional to their potential for insulating the current
leadership from attack. Thus, courts have reviewed rather
summarily laws that specify requirements for individual
candidates. Indeed, limits on re-election to Congress would
specifically promote these democratic principles.
   If a state unilaterally limits the tenure of its
congressional delegation, Congress may be able under the
Constitution to override this restriction by a majority vote
of both houses of Congress. However, to do this, a majority
of the members of Congress would have to go on record as
putting their own self-interest before a provision favored by
two-thirds of their constituency. A clearer statement of
"Congress vs. the People" could not be made.

   TORONTO -- Rio Algom Ltd. said it acquired an 8% stake in
Uranium Resources Inc. "with a view to the possibility" of
acquiring all of the company.
   Rio Algom, which last year broke off talks to acquire
Dallas-based Uranium Resources for $2.55 a share, said it
bought 2.1 million Uranium Resources shares for $1.50 each,
or a total of about $3.1 million, from Elders Resources
Finance Inc., a New York-based unit of Elders Resources Ltd.
of New Zealand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rio Algom said it also paid Elders Resources $2.5 million,
or 35 cents each, for warrants to acquire an additional 7.1
million Uranium Resources shares. The warrants, if exercised,
would give Rio Algom a fully diluted stake of about 25% in
Uranium Resources. The warrants are exercisable at $1.25 each
until March 1992.
   A Rio Algom spokesman said the company held further
acquisition talks with Uranium Resources management last
month but that these also were unsuccessful. He said Rio
Algom offered a lower price this time of between $1.50 and
$2.55 for each Uranium Resources share.
   Uranium Resources said it considers the value of the
company to be "substantially greater" than what Rio Algom was
offering. "We have elected not to pursue further discussions
with Rio at this time because of the apparently wide
discrepancy in values placed on the company," a company
statement said.
   Rio Algom, which is 52%-owned by RTZ Corp. of Britain,
said it may seek further meetings with Uranium Resources
management to discuss acquiring the company.

   MORE RESETTLEMENT IN BURMA

   The Burmese government plans to resettle former
insurgents, homeless villagers and destitute people along the
nation's embattled border with Thailand.
   Rangoon radio said $2 million had been earmarked for
resettlement projects in the Karen and Mon border states
during 1990-91. "The government is pushing hard to develop
these areas to reduce their dependency on smuggling as well
as to neutralize the insurgents," said one Western diplomat
in Rangoon.
   People in the resettlement plan came "from insurgent
groups who have surrendered to the authorities after
regretting their mistakes, villagers who have left their
homeland because of threats from insurgents, and destitutes,"
the radio said. They would be given free food and lodging for
two months and up to $1,076 worth of wood, bamboo and thatch
grass to build their own homes.
   Thousands of Burmese have been forcibly resettled to new
towns from densely populated areas of Rangoon and Mandalay.
Diplomats said the resettlements may have been aimed at
breaking up potential centers of anti-government unrest.
                                                                                                       

   FIGHTING MEXICO'S POLLUTION
                                                                                                       

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari that Tokyo would provide
$786 million to help Mexico fight air pollution, foreign
ministry officials said. "Japan's assistance will be great
news for the Mexican public and should impress them greatly,"
Mr. Salinas was quoted as saying. Mr. Salinas is in Tokyo for
talks with government and business leaders. Japan had already
pledged aid for Mexico's anti-pollution projects but had made
no commitment to a specific sum.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA'S NEW LOAN POLICY
                                                                                                       

   China's central bank will nearly double its planned loan
outlay this year to help pull the economy out of its current
slump, the People's Daily said. The People's Bank of China
will provide 55 billion yuan ($11.65 billion) in credit this
year, up from its original plan of 30 billion yuan, the
official daily newspaper said. Beijing clamped down on credit
in late 1988 as part of an austerity policy aimed at reducing
inflation and cooling off the overheated economy. The
measures succeeded in lowering inflation from about 30% in
early 1989 to about 4% today but also triggered a sharp
decline in economic growth.
                                                                                                       

   HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS IN SWEDEN
                                                                                                       

   Sweden's Social Welfare Board proposed giving homosexuals
living together almost the same rights as married couples.
The board said cohabiting homosexuals should be able to
register their partnerships formally. "We want to show that
homosexual relationships are accepted by society," a board
official said, adding: "We are hoping that this will lead to
long and monogamous relationships and limit AIDS." The
proposal, which could become law by July 1, 1992, wouldn't
give homosexuals living together the right to adopt children,
the board said.

   Saudi Arabia has sent experts to Los Angeles to advise the
city on water desalination, the Saudi Press Agency SPA
reported. SPA said Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was "greatly
impressed" by Saudi Arabia's advanced technology in producing
drinking water from the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea when he
visited a Saudi exhibition now touring the U.S.

   Hungary is enjoying a boom in tourists from outside the
East bloc. The state news agency MTI said that 4.2 million
visitors from hard-currency areas had entered Hungary in the
first four months of this year -- 70% more than in the same
period of 1989. In a separate report, MTI predicted a sharp
drop in the number of Hungarian tourists traveling to East
Germany because of the monetary union of the two Germanys set
for July 1.
                                                                                                       

   REPRIMAND IN JAPAN
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has reprimanded one
of his aides for engaging in stock deals last year.
   The aide, Mitsuo Ando, said, "I was told by Mr. Kaifu,
`Having been my secretary for a long time, surely you know my
feelings {about stock deals}.'" Mr. Ando said he was harshly
reprimanded for the transaction, which was a purchase of
8,000 shares in Meitech, a company that hires out computer
engineers.
   Mr. Ando said the shares cost nearly 30 million yen
($195,000). When Ando bought Meitech shares, the stock was
traded at 3,700 yen per share. Now the shares cost 6,200 yen.
   Members of Mr. Kaifu's cabinet and other high-ranking
parliamentary officials agreed to refrain from dealing in
stocks, real estate and golf-course memberships after a
scandal involving questionable deals in the stock of the
Recruit Co. information-services conglomerate. That
restriction apparently also now applies to top politicians'
aides.

   The Nobel Foundation rejected a proposal for the creation
of a Nobel environmental prize. "We fear an inflation of
prizes would seriously diminish the value of those already
existing," said Stig Ramel, the foundation's chairman. . . .
The state-owned Hluhluwe Game Park in South Africa's eastern
Natal Province sold a breeding herd of five endangered black
rhinoceroses to a private conservationist for $846,000,
officials said.

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- After a worse-than-expected fiscal
third-quarter loss, National Semiconductor Corp. said it
returned to profitability in its fourth quarter on the
strength of record quarterly revenue. For the period ended
May 27, the company posted net income of $4.7 million, or two
cents a share, on revenue of $456.3 million.
   In the year-earlier period, the semiconductor maker had
net of $77.1 million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of
$419.1 million. Year-earlier net included a gain of $174.9
million on the sale of assets. For the year, National
Semiconductor posted a loss of $25 million, or 34 cents a
share, on record revenue of $1.68 billion. In its previous
year, the company had a loss of $23.2 million, or 32 cents a
share, on revenue of $1.65 billion. The previous year's net
included a gain of $220 million on sale of assets.

   National Semiconductor has been hit hard by slumping
prices and margins for its memory chips and customized
semiconductors, conditions that have plagued the industry in
general. The company posted losses for the first and third
quarters of the year just ended after a string of quarterly
losses in fiscal 1989.
   As for the current quarter, National Semiconductor said
that although its first period is a "seasonally slow" time,
the company was "encouraged" by record bookings in its fourth
quarter. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, National Semiconductor closed at $7.125, down 50

   LOS ANGELES -- A manager for a now-defunct aerospace parts
supplier, McHaffie Inc., was sentenced to 20 weekends in
prison and three years' probation for his role in a scheme to
falsify test results on millions of nuts and bolts that are
supposed to hold together aircraft engines.
   Two co-workers, however, had their sentencing postponed.
That's so U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima would have more
time to sort out who was responsible for starting the 10-year
scam, which prosecutors described yesterday as the
longest-running defense procurement fraud ever uncovered. All
three men and the company pleaded guilty in April.

<TEXT>
   The man sentenced, 37-year-old William Whitham, formerly
the shop-floor manager at Sylmar, Calif.-based McHaffie, was
"the least culpable" of the defendants, according to Stephen
Mansfield, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case.
   Sentencing for the company's president, Norman McHaffie,
and quality-control supervisor James Hicks was delayed until
July 2; each, Mr. Mansfield said, is trying to blame the
other for initiating the crime.
   Mr. McHaffie faces as long as 15 years in prison and a
$750,000 fine, while Mr. Hicks could be sentenced to up to 10
years in prison and fined $500,000. The company faces a
maximum penalty of $1.5 million.

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, handing a major setback
to the Securities and Exchange Commission, let stand an
appeals court ruling that said the SEC lacks the authority to
approve trading of new stock "basket" products.
   The high court's action is the third major federal court
decision in recent weeks to undercut the securities
regulator. The two earlier rulings struck down part of the
SEC arsenal against insider trading and an agency rule
mandating equal shareholder voting in most cases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal by the
American and Philadelphia stock exchanges, which introduced
the products last year, and the Chicago Board Options
Exchange. That leaves intact a ruling in August by a federal
appeals court in Chicago that the new "index participations"
should have been subject to regulation by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, not the SEC. The appeals court
said that the products had characteristics of both securities
and futures and that the law makes such instruments subject
to exclusive CFTC authority.
   The Supreme Court's move places additional weight on
legislation proposed by the Bush administration that would
amend the exclusivity rule to allow exchanges to bring new
products to either regulator for approval. But that
legislation has a tough road through both houses of Congress
and is far from certain.
   Index participations, informally called IPs, allow
investors to trade a broad cross-section of the stock market.
The issue gets cloudier there because the products combine
elements of stocks, futures and even mutual funds. The
futures markets maintain that the baskets are disguised
stock-index futures contracts, which allow investors to bet
on the movement of a basket of stocks without owning the
securities. Stock-index futures fall under the jurisdiction
of the CFTC.
   The securities exchanges contend that the products are
closer to options, which give the holder the right but not
the obligation to buy or sell the underlying security.
Options are regulated by the SEC.
   The products would allow individual investors to play
program-trading strategies that traditionally might have been
out of their financial reach. By pegging the products to the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index or a similar barometer,
investors who couldn't afford to trade hundreds of stocks
could make or hedge market bets.
   Unlike a futures contract, which expire with no value at
the end of its life, IPs contracts generally would force
investors to trade out of the product, roll over the contract
or take delivery of the basket of stocks.
   The appeals court ruling forced the exchanges to shut down
IPs trading after just a few months -- and about $74 million
in face value of the contracts. That decision infuriated the
SEC, and Chairman Richard Breeden has decried the ruling as
forcing new products "into the courthouse before they can be
sold in the marketplace."
   Brandon Becker, the SEC's associate director for market
regulation, said the agency was "disappointed" by the Supreme
Court decision. "We thought it was a securities product that
would better trade under securities regulation and
oversight," he said. "We continue to think that's
appropriate." He added that the Philadelphia exchange has
applied for SEC approval of an amended IPs product, and that
the agency's review is pending.
   CFTC officials said they offered to expedite approval of
the products last year. But the exchanges refused to bring
the products to the CFTC for approval, the agency said. A
CFTC spokesman yesterday said the offer for expedited
approval stands. "It's the chairman's {Wendy Gramm's} call,
but we feel there is no reason for it to be any different,"
the spokesman said.
   Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia exchange,
said the Supreme Court decision "is a major step backward in
the regulation and development of innovative new products" on
Wall Street. He said it underscores the "crazy-quilt pattern
of regulation of the securities industry" and will hurt small
investors looking for new products that help them compete
with large institutional investors.
   In their joint Supreme Court appeal, the Amex and CBOE
argued that the appeals court decision would mean that IPs
could only be traded with sponsorship of a commodity board of
trade. The exchanges also warned that CFTC regulation would
afford less protection than investors would receive under
federal and state securities laws, and that more buying on
credit would be allowed, contrary to the intent of Congress.
   An Amex spokesman only said yesterday that the exchange
supports the administration-backed bill that would permit
securities exchanges to trade IPs and other products.
   The Justice Department, caught between the competing
interests of two regulatory agencies, sided with the CFTC. In
its brief, the department acknowledged the SEC view that "the
development of some new financial products will be chilled by
the imprecision of the {appeals court's} analysis governing
whether a product is a futures contract." But the department
said it's up to Congress, not the courts, to address that
problem.

   Heard on the Street:
   Wendy's Stock Sizzles Mainly Due to Rumors
   Of PepsiCo Interest, but Skepticism Abounds

   The stock of Wendy's International lately has been hotter
than its burgers.
   Shares of the nation's fourth-largest hamburger chain have
surged 48% in heavy trading since the beginning of May. They
closed yesterday at 6 7/8, unchanged, on a day when most
other issues on the New York Stock Exchange declined. Last
Thursday, the stock hit a two-year peak of 7 1/2 as volume
exploded to more than three million shares, outstripping in a
single day Wendy's total volume for the entire month of
February.

<TEXT>
   The main spark for the commotion has been a rumor that
PepsiCo wants to buy Wendy's. Both companies have declined to
comment on the rumor, but some knowledgeable people find it
hard to swallow.
   Other factors also are fueling the rise. Profit, which has
been puny for the past three years, is improving under James
W. Near, the company's new chief executive. Shearson Lehman
recently recommended the stock. And more than a dozen
corporate insiders have purchased Wendy's shares this year
(although most of them bought only modest amounts).
   Despite the favorable signs, quite a few money managers
and analysts think that buyers have gorged themselves
excessively on the stock and are headed for a stomachache. At
6 7/8, they point out, Wendy's is selling for 24 times the
past 12 months' earnings from operations.
   That's a rich multiple even for a highly successful
company. Wendy's has been an also-ran in the highly
competitive hamburger wars. In size, it trails McDonald's,
Burger King and Hardee's. In profitability it lags behind
many competitors, with a return on equity of less than 7% in
each of the past three years.
   To be sure, earnings finally are trending up. Some people
forecast profit of as much as 40 cents a share this year, up
from 32 cents last year (seven cents of which reflected an
accounting change and a one-time gain).
   But some analysts look at Wendy's operating results and
ask, in the words of the chain's old slogan: "Where's the
beef?" Much of this year's improvement comes from cutting
back on last year's massive use of discount coupons, says
John Rohs of Wertheim Schroeder. By July or August,
year-over-year comparisons won't any longer show much benefit
from that change, he says.
   Cost-cutting also is playing a big part in this year's
improved results. Though analysts praise Mr. Near for
shrinking expenses adroitly, few view the tactic as one that
can be spun into a long string of sharp earnings gains.
   As for the PepsiCo rumor, it's "ridiculous," says analyst
Caroline Levy of Shearson. (She likes the stock, anyway.)
"Pepsi's strategy is to buy the segment leader," she says.
"If they can't have McDonald's, they'd rather not be there."
   Wendy's stock is simply "going crazy on takeover rumors,"
says Roger Lipton, analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann. "This
happens periodically. Every time {founder} Dave Thomas plays
golf with one of the top guys at PepsiCo, the stock trades
two million shares a day. My own suspicion is that a deal's
unlikely. PepsiCo has said time and time again that their
strategy is to own the No. 1 player in a segment." PepsiCo is
already big in the fast-food business; it controls Kentucky
Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
   A PepsiCo spokesman, while declining to comment on Wendy's
specifically or a hamburger-chain acquisition in general,
said: "We're very comfortable with the businesses we've got."
He added that PepsiCo is in "the enviable position of not
needing to make acquisitions for growth."
   Shearson's Ms. Levy likes Wendy's stock regardless of
takeover possibilities, mostly because she thinks profit
margins will continue to improve. She says Wendy's is
"starting to see the benefits of programs put into place in
the last two to three years," including a 500-person
reduction in headquarters staff and better training programs
to cut employee turnover.
   Michael Esposito, a managing director at BEM Capital in
New York, has been buying the shares and considers them cheap
at 6 to 6 1/2, regardless of any possible takeover. He thinks
Mr. Near, a former franchisee, is "an operations expert" who
is bringing Wendy's back on track after years of
"helter-skelter growth."
   But Ladenburg's Mr. Lipton says he's "neutral to
skeptical." Even granting the optimists their projection of
45 cents a share in earnings for 1991, he says, the stock is
selling for 15 times next year's earnings. For that kind of
money, he says, "You can buy companies that are in control of
their destiny. . . . You can buy the cream of the crop in
this industry."

   CORPORATE JOB TRAINING expands, but it's still inadequate.
   That view is widely held. Most U.S. companies don't see
the link between "continuous training and continuous
improvement," says Harry Hutson, a Dennison Manufacturing
official. They ought to spend 5% of funds on training, he
says, but most spend well under 2%. Dennison and Marriott
Corp. note pressure, amid a worker pinch, to put a new hire
on the job right away, untrained.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rogers Corp. President Norman Greenman says U.S. firms lag
behind nations such as Germany in training. Dennison, Rogers,
Analysis &amp; Technology Inc. and Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing beef up their training programs. Motorola will
boost its $60 million training tab, to give 40 hours of
job-related courses a year to its 100,000 employees.
   Motorola will emphasize retraining. A software engineer's
"half-life" is three to five years, a spokeswoman says.
                                                                                                       

   SEAFIRST BECOMES the first large bank to bargain
collectively.
   After a 12-year battle since the United Food and
Commercial Workers won a union representation vote, the
Seattle-based BankAmerica unit is finally negotiating; but
tough issues such as wages haven't been tackled yet. The
union says calls flood its Local 1182 for organizing help at
other banks such as Security Pacific and Wells Fargo, where
it says workers feel underpaid, overworked and dehumanized.
   With banks less than 3% unionized, the industry is
"absolutely ripe" for organizing, the UFCW says, so the
Seafirst contract will loom large. After the Supreme Court
denied a Seafirst claim that the 1978 UFCW election win
wasn't valid, the bank questioned the union's continuity. A
lower court rejected that argument last December.
                                                                                                       

   AS THE ARMY SHRINKS, the civilian market will tighten for
job seekers.
   A 25% cut may be due for the 764,000-person army, arising
from plans to scale back defense programs. The Air Force,
down 50,000 since 1987, may slash another 90,000; less
proficient pilots or aircraft-repair workers won't be hired,
as standards are boosted, says a spokesman. The services want
to use attrition, the least painful, but any fast cuts could
mean discharges.
   Troop levels and the military's civilian workers already
have eased 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively, from last year.
Finding work will be "difficult," especially for men trained
in special military skills, says AFL-CIO economist John
Zalusky. The American Federation of Government Employees says
workers hit by base closings should be retrained or placed in
vacant military jobs elsewhere.
   But a Pentagon study shows more jobs were created than
lost when bases, closed in the past, became civilian airports
or industrial parks.
                                                                                                       

   ON THE ROAD AGAIN: Forty-one percent of 684 responding
members of the American Productivity &amp; Quality Center make
one to 10 business trips a year, and 27% travel between 11
and 20 times. More than half say that over 80% of the trips
are necessary. The champion: a public-sector manager who
makes 150 trips annually.
                                                                                                       

   HEALTH CARE JOBS will grow the most in the 1990s, a Labor
Department outlook handbook and a poll of 100 executives by
consultant Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas agree. Paralegals
will rise 75%, the largest single-job percentage climb, the
handbook says. Challenger's survey ranks entry-level,
computer and customer-service jobs behind health work, in
expected growth.
                                                                                                       

   PUBLIC RELATIONS contributes to profits, 52 chief
executives surveyed by an International Association of
Business Communicators research group said. They gave PR a
235% return-on-investment rating. More-modest PR chiefs gave
themselves a 205% ROI rating, in the six-year, $400,000
study.
                                                                                                       

   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS: a new corporate cost-cutting target.
   Avon Products' drug claims, less controlled than hospital
bills, soared 75% in 1989, despite use of mail-order
discounts for workers on long-term care. AT&amp;T spent $25
million for retiree drugs in 1988, more than for active
employees. It mulls mail-order plans and prescription cards
for discounts at certain pharmacies, aiming to replace a
"Cadillac" plan with a "Buick."
   Many employer drug-benefit costs climbed as much as 30% in
the past year, says consultant Towers Perrin; it urges moves
such as special drug-use reviews and requiring switches to
cheaper generic drugs. Concurrent Computer trims workers'
share of the health-cost burden if they opt out of the drug
plan. Commercial Metals will better monitor employee claims
and look into discount plans.
   Motors Management, a New Jersey auto-dealer chain, says it
will absorb the rising costs until it "gets too painful."
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Lenore Miller is elected president of the
Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, the largest
woman-led North American union. . . . Unionists mail and
hand-deliver their trash to offices of Los Angeles-based JMB
Realty, to support a janitors' strike against a Denmark-based
contractor that cleans several JMB-owned buildings, and even
get into a fracas with police. . . . Don't go too far: The
Kamber Group, a labor PR firm, runs a "partial pro bono"
campaign to promote the 25th anniversary of two anti-poverty
programs.

   Tokyo stock prices finished lower in thin dealings as lack
of any fresh news kept investors off the trading floor.
   Meanwhile, London stock prices finished near intraday
minimums in dull trading, after a slow start and a poor early
showing on Wall Street.

   In Tokyo, after closing the morning session with a
moderate gain, the Nikkei Index sagged toward the end of the
day on a few rounds of minor selling by arbitragers, traders
said. The Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 161.60 points,
closing at 32376.80.
   "There was no incentive at all to trade," said Masami
Okuma, a senior trader at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International.
"All kinds of investors fully remained on the sidelines," he
said.
   While the first section lacked the energy to boost
large-capital shares, investors, including institutions,
continued to hunt for high-priced, small-capital shares with
bright earnings prospects, traders said, pushing up stocks on
the second section as well as those on the Osaka and Nagoya
stock exchanges.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index fell
318.56 points to 32058.24.
   On Monday, an estimated 300 million shares changed hands
on the first section, down from 460.3 million shares Friday.
Decliners outnumbered advancers 632-300, while 190 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section dropped 15.29 points, or 0.64%, to 2381.03.
   The second section index gained 24.99 points, or 0.60%, to
4178.59. Volume in the section was estimated at 36 million
shares, in line with 35.3 million shares Friday.
   Trading volume on the first section has been constantly
thinning, from more than one billion stocks traded May 28 to
yesterday's 300 million shares.
   "Basically it's all because of {domestic} interest rates,"
which haven't shown a sign of declining, said an official at
Yamaichi Securities.
   To many participants' disappointment, U.S. economic
indicators disclosed Friday didn't help to provide any hint
for direction of either U.S. interest rates or the dollar,
traders said.
   Another set of U.S. indicators is due later this week,
including final first-quarter gross national product data on
Thursday, but those reports are unlikely to be of much help
in giving the currency market any direction, traders said. As
a result, participants expect institutional investors to
continue to hold off from active trading ahead of German
monetary union, now two weeks away, the traders said.
   A few sectors that received what little buying there was
yesterday were pharmaceutical and environment
protection-related stocks.
   Pharmaceuticals gained ahead of the annual conference of
the cancer academy beginning July 3.
   Yoshihiro Nomura, an phamaceutical industrial analyst at
Nomura Research Institute, said the market is moving on
expectations of some new products and testing results
scheduled to be introduced at the conference.
   However, none of the products or results are at a stage to
make sales or profitability forecasts, the analyst said.
   Dainippon Pharmaceutical, which advanced strongly this
past week on the potential earnings prospects of the
company's anti-cancer agent continued to be bought yesterday.
But active profit-taking in the afternoon pushed the stock
down from its intraday high of 3460 yen ($22.47) to close at
3240 yen, up 30 yen from Friday's close.
   Also heavily traded was Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, which
added 10 yen to 3040 yen, down from an intraday high of 3110
yen. Mochida rose 50 yen to 4000 yen, while Taisho gained 40
yen to 2390 yen.
   Chiyoda Corp., which holds a strong market share in
anti-air pollution equipment, gained 80 yen to 2660 yen. Toyo
Seikan Kaisha advanced 240 yen to 4120 yen on the strong
earning prospects for its beverage cans with safety fliptops.
   London shares were marked down early in the session, as
the beginning of the week, a lack of major corporate news,
and the upcoming Royal Ascot race meeting kept fresh interest
at a minimum.
   Later in the session, London stocks continued to be
pressured by a drop on Wall Street.
   Furthermore, market professionals suggested that
institutional equity investors were beginning to assess the
negative influence that may arise from membership in the
exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System,
after last week's euphoria over the beneficial consequences
of entry.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
21.8 points to 2370.5, slightly better than the intraday
minimum of 2367.4. The index reached a high of 2394.5 near
the start of trading.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index dropped 14 points to
1911.9. Volume was a mild 403.4 million shares after
inclusion of a 120 million-share program trade of second-line
stocks, little changed from Friday's 400.2 million shares.
   Among issues, BAA, the airports management concern, rose 7
pence to 423 pence (12 cents to $7.23) after announcing a 29%
rise in pretax profit for the year and the appointment of
Jaguar's chairman, John Egan, as the company's new chief
executive.
   Dealers said the banking sector was generally weaker
following news and speculation about banks' exposure to the
troubled British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings.
   Barclays, which said it has made a #100 million provision
against exposure to the financial services concern, fell 6
pence to 387 pence, Midland dropped 3 pence to 297 pence, and
National Westminster Bank shed 9 pence to 334 pence. Lloyds,
which has said it is selling its business interest in
Portugal to Banco Bilbao de Vizcaya, fell 2 pence to 287
pence.
   There were also worries in the banking sector that some
U.K. banks might be exposed to losses stemming from loans to
Donald Trump, dealers said.
   Elsewhere, Reuters declined 13 pence to #12.81 on
profit-taking, after the stock advanced 7.6% this past week,
dealers said. Additionally, along with the American Stock
Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the
Cincinnati Stock Exchange, the British company announced a
definitive agreement to develop a world-wide after-hours
electronic system to trade listed equities, equity options
and other products.
   Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Frankfurt; lower in
Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich and Madrid; mixed in Brussels and
Stockholm; and unchanged in Milan. South African gold stocks
closed marginally higher.
   Also, stocks closed lower in Seoul, mixed in Wellington,
and higher in Singapore, Sydney, Taipei and Manila. Hong Kong
was closed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,

   Credit Ratings:
   Occidental's Debt,
   Preferred Ratings
   Lowered by S&amp;P

   LOS ANGELES -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered its
ratings on $8.2 billion of Occidental Petroleum Corp. debt
and preferred stock, citing high fixed costs, heavy dividend
demands and expected weak earnings.
   The New York ratings firm said Occidental's senior debt
and preferred stock were downgraded to triple-B-minus from
triple-B.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition to Occidental's securities, the downgraded
senior debt includes similar ratings for Occidental's Oxy USA
Inc., Occidental International Finance N.V., Oxy
Petrochemicals Inc. (formerly Cain Chemical Inc.), and United
Energy Resources Inc. units. Preferred stock downgraded
included that of Oxy Petrochemicals and Natural Gas Pipelines
of America.
   Also downgraded was Occidental's subordinated debt, which
was lowered to double-B-plus from triple-B-minus. The rating
on the company's commercial paper was dropped to A-3 from
A-2.
   Standard &amp; Poor's said the downgrades "reflect
expectations that Occidental's weak earnings and cash flow
protection measures will continue {to be} substandard for the
foreseeable future."
   Occidental declined to comment on the downgrades, which
were announced after the close of trading. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the company's common stock closed
at $26.50 a share, off 50 cents, paralleling declines in oil
issues and the overall market.
   Analysts have for some time noted that Occidental, an oil,
chemicals and agricultural products concern, has paid
substantially more annually in dividends than it makes in
profit. Last year, for instance, cash dividend payments
totaled $679 million against net income of $285 million, or
$1.03 a share. Revenue last year totaled $20.07 billion.
   S&amp;P noted "high fixed charges stemming from aggressive
debt levels and a very high common dividend payout," which,
it said, "precludes meaningful improvement to the balance
sheet."
   The rating concern said asset sales probably will be
required to supplement internally generated funds in meeting
Occidental's capital-spending requirements. It said
Occidental's financial flexibility is enhanced by a large,
diversified asset base.
   However, the rating concern said that "absent
larger-than-expected asset sales, material debt reduction is
unlikely" and that debt as a proportion of overall capital is
likely to remain at about 55% or more. According to a recent
calculation, Occidental's debt represented about 58% of the
company's total capital, compared with an average of about
46% for the industry.

   Japan's Buying of U.S. Securities
   May Add Stability, Not Volatility

   TOKYO -- It's 9:25 on a Friday night, but here at Norin
Chukin Bank, about 50 Japanese men in shirt sleeves are
staring into computer terminals, preparing to alter the
course of U.S. interest rates.
   In five minutes, the monthly employment numbers will be
announced in Washington. If the employment figure is too big,
the Japanese traders will suspect inflation is on the rise
and sell U.S. Treasury bonds. That, multiplied by similar
actions in dozens of other trading rooms across the city,
could drive up interest rates for the U.S. government, U.S.
home buyers and U.S. corporations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More than ever before, U.S. interest rates are made in
Japan. Large financial institutions here have become such
huge players in American markets that Wall Street analysts
constantly fret over whether "the Japanese" will participate
in a coming Treasury auction or whether they will divert
their money to Europe.
   Some analysts argue this dependence has made American
markets more volatile. Single Japanese institutions control
huge blocks of money, and can, if they choose, pull out
quickly. Such scare scenarios, however, are largely
overstated. Fears that this year's drop in the Tokyo stock
market would spill over to Wall Street proved unfounded. And
a closer look at the recent role of Japanese money in
American markets suggests that, if anything, the Japanese
have had a stabilizing influence.
   For one thing, Japanese investors are by nature
conservative and reluctant to make rapid moves. Also, they,
as well as other investors, still view the U.S. as a safe
investment haven. "The world's mattress is right here in our
markets, and I don't see anything on the horizon that will
change that," says Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   Moreover, many large Japanese institutions still respond
to the wishes of the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance.
In times of disruption in the U.S. market, such as October
1987 and October 1989, a few judiciously-placed phone calls
from the ministry can prove enormously helpful. "Most people
in this business are guessing that the Ministry helped the
U.S. market on Black Monday by requesting insurance funds and
trust banks to buy and support the market," says Ryuji
Konishi, general manager of financial engineering at the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
   Still, U.S. dependence on Japanese money remains
unsettling. Analysts say that a collapse of Japan's
staggeringly high land prices, for instance, could force
Japanese investors to bring their money home, with
devastating effects on the U.S. economy. Similarly, a
shattering earthquake in Tokyo, like the one in 1923, would
have "a major impact on the U.S.," according to a study by
Tokai Bank.
   "It's kind of scary for the U.S. to depend on Japan for
its capital," says Akio Mikuni, president of a bond-rating
firm in Tokyo. "It's quite dangerous for U.S. financing."

   NCNB Corp., in a move to bolster its mortgage-service
operations, said it agreed to acquire a large portfolio from
Dallas-based Fundamental Mortgage Corp., a unit of San
Jacinto Savings Association, Houston. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The agreement calls for NCNB, a banking company based in
Charlotte, N.C., to purchase Fundamental's mortgage-servicing
agreements with a principal balance outstanding of as much as
$10.4 billion, as well as Fundamental's loan-servicing
facility in Louisville, Ky., with about 300 employees.

   NCNB said the proposed purchase would triple the size of
its NCNB Mortgage Corp., which now manages $4.8 billion in
mortgage-servicing agreements. The agreement, which is
subject to due diligence by both companies and approvals by
directors of the companies and regulators, is expected to be
completed by the end of the third quarter.

   NEW YORK -- Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. formed a joint venture
with two Soviet companies, allowing the accounting and
professional-services firm to audit balance sheets of Soviet
concerns and of ventures between Western and U.S.S.R.
companies.
   The venture will be owned 70% by Arthur Andersen, 25% by
Promstroybank of the U.S.S.R., and 5% by an engineering
company, NPO Dinamo Moscow. Arthur Andersen said it is the
first of the major international accounting and consulting
firms to be registered to do audits in the Soviet Union.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move follows by a few days the announcement by KPMG
Peat Marwick, also a major accounting and consulting firm,
that it expects to have the first Chinese joint accounting
venture approved by the Beijing government.
   Arthur Andersen's venture will be "servicing international
companies going into the Soviet Union and helping current
Soviet enterprises structure and restructure to get ready for
the global environment," said Paul W. Hoffman, a partner in
Arthur Andersen's office here.
   The venture marks Arthur Andersen's return to the Soviet
Union. "We were there from the first days of detente in the
early '70s, when we were expecting more U.S. investment," Mr.
Hoffman said. But "things got very quiet in the late '70s,"
particularly after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and the
firm left in 1983, Mr. Hoffman said.

   Guare Comedy Premieres; Weill-Lerner Revival

   "Six Degrees of Separation" (Lincoln Center Theater) is
based on an actual hoax played on several affluent families
in New York City some years ago. In each case, a distraught
young man showed up at the door one evening, claiming he was
a friend of the families' conveniently absent children. Also,
he was the son of Sidney Poitier and had just been mugged.
The good Samaritans took him in for the night, only to find
out later that it was they who had been taken in -- their
children had never heard of him.
   Using this odd incident as a starting point, John Guare
has fashioned a sage and moving comedy about class, privacy,
homosexuality, racism and conflicts between parents and
children. Not only is it enormous fun, its intellectual
pleasures are dazzling, with imagery that bounces
effortlessly from pop culture to erudition, "Cats" to
"Catcher in the Rye," Kandinsky to the Sistine Chapel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As the houseguest Paul, James McDaniel is exuberant and
engaging. He's the type of man who usually preys on women,
adapting his charm to suit his particular quarry. He's a
seducer, but his aim is to give happiness; he is oblivious to
the pain he inflicts. Anthony Trollope would have called him
a bounder. Paul doesn't rob or molest his hosts; on the
contrary, he's out to please them. He cooks dinner, regales
them with celebrity stories about his "father," and leads
them in an erudite discussion on the power of the
imagination. As he later says to one woman who let him into
her home, "You let me use all the parts of myself that
night."
   Stockard Channing gives a luminous performance as Ouisa,
one of Paul's hostesses. There's an appealing touch of
self-mockery about her. She's a refined upper-class WASP who
doesn't take herself, her ambitious art-dealer husband or her
bratty Ivy League children too seriously. When someone says
something too earnest, she'll roll her eyes, give a little
moue and crack a joke. She despairs that she and her friends
have turned Paul into "an anecdote to dine out on or dine in
on" and is obsessed with finding out what became of him --
and in doing so, taps into her long-dormant imaginative life.
There's more than a touch of the do-gooder about her, but
that is complicated by her motherly feelings toward Paul and
even by a hint of sexual attraction.
   While the basic shape of "Six Degrees of Separation" is
that of a fast-paced drawing-room comedy, with witticisms
flying, there are occasional shifts to more somber tones that
are mostly successful. (The biggest exception is a suicide
that Paul inspires.)
   The title of the play comes from someone's theory that
every person is linked to every other person by a chain of
just six people. The point? The world's Pauls and Ouisas will
find it worth the effort to follow the chain to one another.
Corny as this may sound, there's not a kernel of corn in
evidence here. This inspiring and uplifting play is one of
the sweetest successes of recent years.
   Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, one of Broadway's more notable
failures is being revived by the American Musical Theater
Festival at the Walnut Street Theatre. The 1948 show "Love
Life" didn't produce any tunes folks sing in the shower or in
a drive cross-country. So why revive it? The main reason is
that it's a historical curiosity: the only collaboration
between Kurt Weill and Alan Jay Lerner.
   Weill's music may have been more sophisticated in
"Threepenny Opera" and Lerner's lyrics sassier in "My Fair
Lady" and "Gigi," but the 20 numbers here are by no means
trivial. One, "Here I'll Stay," is absolutely lovely -- a
lyrical celebration of the pleasures of home. Another, "I
Remember It Well," is an early version of the wickedly funny
song of the same title that Lerner re-did for "Gigi" (with
more singable music by Frederick Loewe). There are a couple
of big bluesy numbers that Weill derived from the pop music
of the day.
   "Love Life" is interesting historically, too, in that it's
the progenitor of the "concept" musical, later exemplified by
"Cabaret" and "Chorus Line" and seen on Broadway today in
Tommy Tune's "Grand Hotel -- The Musical." In "Love Life," a
skimpy plot alternates with flamboyant vaudeville
song-and-dance numbers that more or less pick up on what's
happening in the story. This approach was so new to audiences
of the day that Lerner and Weill wrote an article in the New
York Times trying to explain what their show was all about.
It should be remembered that the musical that won the Tony
that season was Cole Porter's witty "Kiss Me Kate," with a
storyline stolen from the master plotter of "Taming of the
Shrew -- The Play."
   In the Lerner-Weill context, the last happy couple in
American history must have been George and Martha Washington.
"Love Life's" "plot" tracks the unhappy marriage of a generic
American husband and wife, Susan and Samuel Cooper, from 1792
to 1948. Starting with the pernicious Industrial Revolution,
which lured Dad away from his home workshop and to the
factory, men have been hell-bent on making money. By the time
the Gilded Age comes along, women are contaminated too and
demand their share of time away from home. After the Second
World War, Mom finally gets her chance at earning some filthy
lucre, and the invention of the television creates the first
strain of couch potatoes. Divorce results.
   Richard Muenz and Debbie Shapiro, as the Coopers, are
accomplished musical-comedy performers with lusty, richly
modulated voices. Ms. Shapiro won a Tony last year for her
performance in "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" and Mr. Muenz is
fresh from a charming role in the off-Broadway hit "Closer
Than Ever." The third lead, Neal Ben-Ari, lacks pizzazz as
the emcee, a soulful precursor of "Cabaret's" master of
ceremonies.
   Before the final curtain falls, the Coopers effect a wary
reconciliation. But since late 20th-century audiences know
about the battle of the sexes awaiting Sam and Sue in the
1960s it's hard to consider this a happy ending.
   In New York, the battle of the sexes, '80s-style, is on
view in a slight off-Broadway comedy, "Elliott Loves"
(Promenade Theater). It was written by Jules Feiffer and
directed by Mike Nichols -- who last teamed up in the film
"Carnal Knowledge."
   The play has a promising opening. Elliott (Anthony Heald),
a middle-aged nervous lover, delivers a wistful, funny
monologue about the woman he's recently fallen for. One
minute he has "the desire to run away from her, and the next
minute the desire to be with her for the rest of my life."
Speaking of sex, he says: "You take the forbidden aspect out
. . . and it's as erotic as golf."
   Elliott introduces his girlfriend (Christine Baranski) to
his high school buddies, who haven't advanced emotionally
beyond their prom days. The boys now are in their 40s and all
have girl trouble, which they prattle on about while Elliott
sulks in the corner. One's a divorced alcoholic. Another,
also divorced, once got so angry at his then-wife that he
drove her BMW over a cliff. The third, still tenuously
married, still finds pornography as gripping as he did in
high school.
   As for the girlfriend, her character is a hopeless
mishmash. She starts off as a hilarious neurotic (which Ms.
Baranski plays for all it's worth), then turns condescending
and bossy, and in the final scene somehow ends up alternately
spewing vitriol and platitudes. Elliott's character is
equally perplexing. There's no examination of why he is
unable to wrap up love, sex and marriage in a single package.
   The acerbic one-liners that dot the play, while often
amusing, don't satisfy even the appetite for frothy comedy.
It's like plunging into a bowl of whipped cream and searching
in vain for the chocolate cake and ice cream.

   Mitsubishi Corp. said it is considering setting up a
joint-venture company with Chrysler Corp. in Ontario to
produce medium-sized passenger cars, but the Japanese trading
company emphasized that no decisions have been made.
   A Mitsubishi spokesman said the proposed venture, which
has been under discussion for the past year, would be in
charge of the stamping plants for production of LH cars, a
series of models that Chrysler, based in Highland Park,
Mich., plans to start producing in 1992. Success with the
models is important for Chrysler, which is seeking to reverse
its slipping competitiveness in the North American market.
Though Chrysler has long-established ties in the U.S. with
Mitsubishi Motors Co., the auto maker in the Mitsubishi
group, the Canadian venture would be pursued separately, the
spokesman said.

   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest economic newspaper,

cars in North America, and that total investment in it would
reach $105 million.

   NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
launched its automated system for trading securities in the
private-placement market.
   Securities firms and other institutions have been waiting
for the NASD to hook up the system, known as Portal, ever
since regulators in April passed rules making it easier to
sell and trade privately placed securities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Portal, short for Private Offerings, Resales and Trading
through Automated Linkages, will be able to handle any bond
or stock traded under the new regulations, the NASD said. The
system automates trading in the estimated $200 billion
private-placement market by allowing use of personal
computers and Nasdaq terminals to trade. Nasdaq is the NASD's
automated quotations sytem.
   Twenty major U.S. and European securities firms,
accounting for about 80% of the activity in privately placed
stocks and bonds, have signed up for the new trading system,
the NASD said. Four financial institutions, representing
pension and investment funds world-wide, also have been
approved as qualified buyers, it said. And 60 more
institutions are expected to join soon, according to the
NASD.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission in April
unanimously approved Rule 144a, allowing large market players
to trade among themselves in the private-placement market
without going back to the registration and disclosure
process. Only institutions that own $100 million or more in
securities can buy private placements under the rule.

   Your Money Matters:
   Is It Wise to Run With Bad-News Bulls?

   Some stock-market investors just love bad news.
   There's nothing they like better than a chance to grab up
stock in a promising company after some piece of bad news has
hammered the price down to what they consider a bargain
level.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And the current volatile market is giving them plenty of
opportunities. "In this `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' market,
everyone is poised with their finger on the sell button,"
says Kurt Brouwer, partner in Brouwer &amp; Janachowski, a San
Francisco investment-management firm.
   But making money in the stock market by buying on bad news
takes keen analysis and access to information. Most
professionals don't think it's a good approach for
individuals.
   "It's a very dangerous game for small investors, because
you must know the stock and the company extremely well," says
Alan Westin, president of Westin Capital Corp., a Los Angeles
investment firm.
   The idea is to buy "on a discrete, one-time-only bad piece
of news instead of the first indication of a long-term
illness," says John Markese, research director of the
American Association of Individual Investors. "It's hard to
tell the difference, and the approach of automatically buying
on the bad news has gotten a lot of people into trouble."
   Still, when used with care, the bad-news strategy has been
successful for many investors. "If you stick with industry
leaders that have achieved strong growth records in the past
and have run into a temporary problem, you can do well," says
Jim Collins, chairman of Insight Capital Management, a
Moraga, Calif., money manager that specializes in growth
stocks.
   The secret, says Mr. Brouwer, is lots of homework. "You
must study the company, look at the annual reports and check
the consistency of their earnings," he says. "If you're
looking to do this with a computer software company, go to a
software store and find out what they think of the products."
   Peggy Schmeltz, a Bowling Green, Ohio, investor, does this
kind of in-depth homework. "I keep a card file on 200 good
growth stocks, and I record all their prices and
price-earnings ratios," she says. "Whenever I see a price
drop, I look into how far it dropped and why." If the market
has overreacted, she'll buy.
   Among her successes: Union Carbide Corp., which she bought
in July 1985, a little over six months after the poison-gas
disaster at its subsidiary's plant in Bhopal, India. Concerns
about the company's liability drove the stock down sharply.
Mrs. Schmeltz says she bought it at $45 and sold in December
of that year at $70.
   Buying on the bad news is a different game from buying a
turnaround situation when a company is on the verge of going
into bankruptcy court. Many investors reaped huge profits
after buying Chrysler Corp. in the early 1980s when the auto
maker was seeking a loan guarantee from the government. Under
Lee Iacocca, Chrysler recovered in the following months, and
some investors made gains of as much as 400% on their stock
purchases.
   That's a much tougher call than buying on the bad news.
The bad-news strategy "doesn't target companies whose
viability is in doubt," says David Dreman, president of
Dreman Value Management, New York, who uses the bad-news
approach in his strategy of buying undervalued stocks.
   "We don't buy companies with too much debt," he says.
"This isn't a play on whether the company will survive a
financial crisis. We buy good companies with solid long-term
prospects who have temporary bad news."
   Two recent examples show how bad-news plays can lead to
profits.
   Consider Oracle Systems Corp., a maker of data base
management software. With a compound annual profit growth
rate of 121% a year from 1985 to 1989, the company was a
darling of Wall Street, with a stock price above $25 a share.
   Then, on March 27, the company reported flat fiscal
third-quarter earnings of 18 cents a share, seven cents below
what analysts had been expecting. Officials said the
lackluster earnings were an anomaly, blaming them on an
internal foul-up that put $15 million of software contracts
into the fourth quarter instead of the third.
   On March 28, Oracle's stock plunged to $17.375 a share --
a one-day loss of 31% on volume of 21 million shares, the
highest single-day volume ever for an over-the-counter stock.
Some analysts told their clients to sell because they were
concerned about Oracle's earnings growth rate and its control
of operations.
   Mr. Collins of Insight Capital says he went in the next
day, buying some shares at $18. Over the next four weeks, he
bought more shares at prices ranging from $14.75 to $19 each.
"Oracle is a leader in its field, and the consensus of the
pros was that they expected its earnings growth rate to be
30% to 40% a year for 1990 and 1991," Mr. Collins says. "When
you find a leader hit hard, you have a good play." Oracle
Systems has since recovered to $22.50.
   Nordstrom Inc., a Seattle-based retail department store
chain in the midst of a national expansion, is another Wall
Street favorite that took a recent hit. Because of a long
record of strong earnings and sales growth, the stock opened
the year at $38.75. But in late April, a spate of news about
the company's battle with a union and inventory problems
drove the stock down to $27.
   Abbott Keller, investment strategist for Concord
Management Co., a San Mateo, Calif., money-management firm,
says concerns over the company's labor problems were
"overstated." In addition, he says, a first-quarter earnings
report that showed a 42% decline in per-share earnings wasn't
indicative of a slowing of the company's growth rate. "With
any retail chain, you don't know about the year until the
fourth quarter," he says. "People make a big deal out of the
first- and second-quarter earnings, but they don't count
much."
   Nordstrom stock has since rebounded to $34.25.
   But the bad-news strategy can backfire if the bad news
turns out to be the first of many negatives for a company.
Such was the case, says Mr. Westin, with First Executive
Corp., a Los Angeles insurance holding company with a large
junk bond portfolio. A year ago, the company's stock was
selling for $16 a share. But by last September, problems in
the junk bond market had driven the price down to $10.
   "We were told by some analysts that all the bad news was
out, and that even if the company marked down the junk bond
portfolio by 50%, the stock was still selling below its book
value," says Mr. Westin. "But I wasn't willing to bet this
was a one-time thing."
   More bad news came later. First Executive announced a
year-end charge of $515 million for bond defaults and
projected a "substantial loss" for 1989. Later, the
fourth-quarter loss alone totaled $835 million. In May, First
Executive said it paid out $1.33 billion in the first quarter
to holders surrendering insurance policies and annuities. The
stock closed yesterday at $2.5625 a share.

   NEW YORK -- Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. received
permission from the Federal Communications Commission to
transmit its phone lists to other companies, paving the way
for a new directory service from American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.
   The service, which AT&amp;T calls Find America, had been
awaiting FCC clearance since January. Southwestern Bell will
offer the service to its local business customers under the
name Southwestern Bell DirectLine Custom.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The service is designed to allow corporate customers using
special software to gain electronic access to phone company
customer lists using a computer instead of an operator as an
intermediary. The idea is to spur productivity and lower
directory assistance charges.
   An AT&amp;T spokesman said the company has verbal agreements
with the other six regional Bell companies as well as
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone Co. to
provide their listings. This should enable AT&amp;T to offer
nationwide listings by the end of the year, the spokesman
said.

   Foxboro Co. toughened its anti-takeover shareholder rights
plan less than a week after the company disclosed receiving
several takeover offers in response to its solicitation of
possible buyers.
   The toughening of the plan raised speculation that
Foxboro, a maker of industrial process controls, doesn't like
one or more of the suitors or offers it has in hand. The
company, based in Foxboro, Mass., hasn't named the suitors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Foxboro shares fell $1.25 to close at $34.875.
   Under the amended plan, holders of Foxboro common would
get rights to purchase preferred shares at half the market
value after a party acquires 15% of Foxboro's common or after
a party deemed by Foxboro to be "adverse" acquires 10% of the
shares. Previously, holders could exercise the rights when
someone acquired 30% of Foxboro's shares.

   ARMONK N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp. said
it developed a method that allows computers to recognize
overlapping handwritten letters, a step on the road toward
computers that understand script handwriting.
   Such machines, dubbed note-pad computers, are being touted
as the next big thing in computing, because they would allow
people who are intimidated by technology to write with a
penlike instrument on a computer screen, which can be an
easier way to communicate than typing strings of complicated
commands.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, lightweight, portable note-pad computers
would open up new applications -- inventory-taking, for
example, or use by salespeople, secretaries and journalists.
   Several note-pad computers are already being marketed,
most notably by Tandy Corp.'s Grid Systems unit. But these
early stabs at handwriting recognition require users to print
clearly and to leave adequate spacing between letters. IBM
said its advance, which it presented at an industry
conference in Atlantic City, N.J., points the way toward
eliminating these restrictions.
   "This is another nice step in a continual progression to
the point where a computer can recognize whatever you slap
down on its screen," said Vern Raburn, chairman of Slate
Corp., a Scottsdale, Ariz., company developing software for
note-pad computers.

   Great Western Financial Corp. said it agreed to acquire
$700 million in Florida retail deposits from Carteret Savings
Bank, Morristown, N.J.
   Great Western will pay $26.5 million, or about 3.7 cents
on the dollar, for the deposits. The price includes the
purchase of certain Carteret branch offices in Palm Beach and
Broward counties, Fla.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Great Western, a Beverly Hills, Calif., savings and loan
concern, said the acquisition will increase its Florida
deposit base by 40% and substantially boost its presence in
Palm Beach County, one of the fastest-growing areas of the
nation.
   Carteret, a unit of AmBase Corp., said the sale is a "key
element" in its plan to streamline its retail banking and
concentrate on New Jersey markets.
   The proposed acquisition is considerably smaller than an
earlier Great Western plan to acquire about $2.4 billion in
deposits of CenTrust Bank, another New Jersey concern with
substantial Florida holdings. That deal, which called for a
cash payment of $150 million, or six cents for each dollar on
deposit, collapsed when CenTrust was seized by federal
regulators after running up huge junk-bond losses.

   To Contribute
   To Trump Loan

   Three New Jersey banks have tentatively agreed to
contribute about $15 million toward a $60 million loan
guarantee to Donald Trump, people involved in the
negotiations said.
   The agreement, reached in talks yesterday, would remove
one major obstacle to the loan package agreed to by Mr.
Trump's major creditors last week. The New Jersey banks are
said to be divisions of First Fidelity Bancorp, National
Westminster Bank and Midlantic National Bank. The banks
couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even with the New Jersey banks aboard, the developer's
loan package still faces obstacles in winning banks'
approval: Neither Chase Manhattan Corp. nor Citicorp are
believed to have persuaded other creditors who have purchased
portions of their loans to go along with the plan.
   Mr. Trump has been in intense discussions with his major
creditors for about three weeks after evidence mounted that
the cash flow from his properties would not be enough to
cover interest on about $2 billion in bank loans in the
coming year.
   He missed $73 million in payments to Trump's Castle
bondholders and to Manufacturers Hanover Corp. If Mr. Trump's
bondholders are not paid by 12:01 a.m. EDT, June 27, they
will have the right to foreclose on the casino, which could
trigger defaults on many of Mr. Trump's other properties.
   Under the tentative agreement reached with Mr. Trump's
creditors, the banks would suspend interest payments and give
Mr. Trump a little more than $60 million. In exchange, Mr.
Trump would put up the bulk of his empire as collateral and
agree to an orderly sale of many of his assets.
   The banks are, in effect, betting that the $60 million
will be enough to tide Mr. Trump over, and allow him to avoid
selling his trophies at fire-sale prices. Mr. Trump owns
three Atlantic City casinos, the Trump Shuttle, the Plaza
Hotel in Manhattan, and various other real estate properties.
   Mr. Trump's four major New York creditors are units of
Bankers Trust Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp.

   WASHINGTON -- Museum curators have opened a new front in
the Cold War. An exhibit coming to the Smithsonian's Air and

   Deployment of the once nuclear-tipped missiles generated a

part of a touring exhibit that will later open at the Central
Armed Forces Museum in Moscow under the banner "Do Veri, No

from both sides are busy verifying the destruction of 888 of
the missiles under the terms of the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear

Wall that was the backdrop for much of the Cold War drama in
the 1960s. It is heading for a West German museum, as plans
are under way to make much of the rest of the wall a mere
memory.

   The Airbus Industrie consortium said Turkish Airlines
ordered five Airbus A-340s and took options on five
additional aircraft in a bid to modernize its fleet.
   The first aircraft will be delivered in spring 1993.
Airbus doesn't disclose the value of contracts received, but
the most recently available listed price for the A-340 is
about $91 million.

   Turkish Airlines also ordered CFM International engines,
valued at as much as $300 million, to power the Airbus
Industrie A-340 planes. CFM, based in Evendale, Ohio, is a
joint venture of Snecma, the Paris aircraft-engine
manufacturer, and General Electric Co., of Fairfield, Conn.
   Airbus is a consortium of Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British
Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.
   Airbus said Turkish Airlines will use the new planes on
its nonstop service to the U.S. and Asia. The airline already
operates 13 A-340s.

   London's Stock Exchange
   May Cut Staff 10% in '90

   LONDON -- London's stock exchange may cut its work force
this year by a further 10%, or about 260 jobs, as part of a
continuing effort to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
   Releasing its annual report, the exchange said staff
totals have fallen to about 2,600 from 3,000 in recent years.
"We have clearly set targets to reduce that number further
over the coming year," the exchange said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Peter Rawlins, chief executive officer, declined at a news
conference to give specific targets, though he conceded an
additional reduction "on the order" of 10% is conceivable. He
said the exchange will try to achieve the cutbacks without
layoffs.
   Mr. Rawlins said the exchange ended the year with a
#453,000 ($774,403) pretax profit after rebates to member
firms. The small surplus "very much reflects the essentially
break-even position to which we are aiming the finances of
the exchange," he said. After taxes, the exchange swung to a
#603,000 loss, compared with an #11.3 million surplus a year
earlier.
   Meanwhile, the exchange's chairman, Andrew Hugh Smith,
said he plans to meet with counterparts from other European
Community exchanges in Brussels on July 3 to discuss recent
efforts toward a common informationsharing and stock trading
system for Europe. These efforts have prompted acrimony among
various EC member states, but officials said they are
continuing to try to achieve a compromise to move their unity
campaign forward.

   Credit Markets:
   Treasurys Lose More Ground as Anxiety Grows
   Over Prospect of Heavier Government Borrowing

   NEW YORK -- Investors continued to back away from Treasury
bonds, which fell about 3/8 point, or $3.75 for each $1,000
face amount.
   Traders said the sell-off in Treasurys was a continuation
from Friday when bond prices fell sharply in reaction to
stronger-than-expected May industrial production data.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Investors are expecting the U.S. government to step up its
debt issuance this summer, and that's one reason why they're
turning cautious on the market, said Joseph Liro, economist
at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co.
   "For the third quarter, we're talking awesome numbers for
Treasury borrowing," said Mr. Liro. "Counting Resolution
Trust Corp., it looks like $65 to $70 billion for the third
quarter alone," he said. The RTC is the government agency
overseeing the bailout of the thrift industry.
   Government demand for debt is growing due to expenses
associated with the savings and loan bailout, and to weak
corporate tax payments, Mr. Liro said. Next week, the first
signs of swelling U.S. debt offerings could be seen in the
Treasury market. Mr. Liro expects the Treasury to announce a
record $11 billion 2-year note offering, and $8.5 billion
4-year note offering. Mr. Liro also expects the Treasury's
weekly bill auctions to swell from about $17.2 currently to
$18 billion sometime later in the third quarter.
   The thrift bailout has created new uncertainty about the
size of the government's credit demands, traders say.
Expectations of higher Treasury-bill issuance have narrowed a
traditional money market gauge known as the
Treasury-Eurodollar or TED spread.
   Typically, Eurodollars, or dollar deposits in banks
abroad, trade at higher interest rates than Treasury bills
because they are viewed as less secure. But lately, the
spread between Eurodollars and Treasurys has narrowed as
investors have anticpated higher Treasury-bill rates to
accomodate larger federal borrowing.
   The TED spread has narrowed to about 0.79 percentage point
recently from its usual spread of about 1.2 percentage points
to 1.5 percentage points, Mr. Liro notes. (The TED spread is
based on trading in futures contracts for both Treasury bills
and Eurodollars.)
   What's ironic about the narrowing of this financial market
indicator is that usually it widens in times of financial
distress as investors flock to Treasury bills, commonly
viewed as the safest of all investments. A so-called flight
to quality in Treasury bills usually pushes their rates
lower.
   Lately, credit market traders have marvelled at investor
complacency over the deteriorating credit quality of several
banks, corporations, and, of course, Donald Trump.
   "Normally, you would expect to see people buy Treasury
bills because if Trump goes under it's an example of how
overextended people are," said Steven Kordas, assistant vice
president of proprietary trading at Carroll McEntee &amp;
McGinley. "People are very complacent because the government
is bailing out everybody."
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Overall, junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with
low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended the
session 1/4 to 3/8 point lower.
   Among the notable losers were junk bonds of Trump Taj
Mahal Funding Inc. and related casino bonds issued by real
estate developer Donald Trump.
   Trump Taj's 14% first-mortgage bonds, due in 1998, dropped
2 1/8 points to end at 51 7/8 on the American Stock Exchange.
   Trump Castle Funding Inc. 13.75% first-mortgage bonds, due
in 1997, shed 2 points to end at 53.
   But junk bond traders said activity in Trump debt was
relatively light and calm. One reason might be is that
holders of bonds on which Mr. Trump has defaulted are at the
front of the creditors' line. Mr. Trump is in 10-day grace
period to meet interest payments on the bonds.
   "If he defaults, we own it; we'll take over the
buildings," said Edward D'Alelio, managing director at Putnam
High Yield Funds, which owns some of the Trump Castle bonds.
   Meanwhile, junk bonds of Trump Plaza Funding Inc.,
considered the crown jewel of the Trump empire, continued to
show strength.
   Trump Plaza's 12 7/8% first-mortgage bonds, due in 1998,
ended at 83, up a couple points from Friday's closing level.
Trump Plaza is in the best financial shape of all Mr. Trump's
casinos, traders said. Investors, they added, are speculating
that Mr. Trump may be forced to sell Trump Plaza.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   U.S. Treasury securities fell slightly in light trading.
   Analysts and traders attributed the selling to a continued
negative sentiment following Friday's bond market rout and
jitters about upcoming supply. The 30-year bond fell 13/32 to
103 2/32 compared with 103 15/32 Friday. The yield rose to
8.46% from 8.42% late Friday. Prices on the 10-year note fell
to 102 15/32, down from 102 23/32 on Friday. The yield on the
10-year rose to 8.48% from 8.45% Friday.
   At the government's weekly Treasury bill auction, the
average discount rate for three-month bills was set at 7.74%,
while the average rate for six-month bills was set at 7.64%.
The rates were slightly higher to unchanged from last week's
auction when they were 7.73% and 7.64%, respectively.
   Here are the details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   British government bonds, or gilts, ended sharply lower on
a deterioration in the government's budget position and other
data suggesting building inflationary pressures.
   Among benchmarks, the Treasury's 11.75% issue due
2003/2007 was down one point at 101 5/8 to yield 11.51%. The
Treasury 12% bond due 1995 was off 14/32 at 99 5/8 to yield
12.11%.
   French Treasurys finished slightly lower after a quiet
session.
   The West German bond market was also quiet. The actively
traded 7.75% 10-year note due February 2000 was quoted at
92.70 to 92.85, down slightly from Friday's levels.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Lacking any impetus to move prices higher, tax-exempt
issues ended 1/8 to 1/4 point lower in sluggish dealings.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were off 1/8, at 98 1/4
to yield 7.33%.
   Looking ahead on the municipal new-issue calendar, today
Minnesota will sell $200 million of general-obligation bonds
via competitive bid.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended with losses of
1/4 point or less, after barely moving from early levels as
participants brace for an influx of new supply.
   Among actively traded mortgage securities issues,
Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities for
July delivery were down 7/32 at 99 2/32, while the 10%
securites were down 1/4 at 101 14/ 32.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities for July
delivery were off 5/32 at 98 11/32 and the 10% securities
were down 1/8 at 100 13/32.
   Fannie Mae July 9.5% securities were 5/32 lower, and the
10% securities were lower by 1/8 at 100 29/32.

   IRVINE, Calif. -- Gradco Systems Inc. reported a $28.7
million loss for its fourth quarter, reflecting one-time
write-downs related mostly to the company's closure of U.S.
manufacturing facilities and the loss of Xerox Corp. as a
major customer.
   The maker of paper-handling equipment for copiers and
printing machinery said the latest period's loss amounted to
$3.79 a share. A year earlier, Gradco had profit of $1.8
million, or 27 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue plunged 36% in the latest period to $18.5 million
from $28.9 million.
   Separately, Gradco said that, as a result of a newly
completed private sale of a 27% stake in the company's
Japanese subsidiary, Gradco will record a one-time gain of
$18 million, or $2.35 a share, for its first quarter, ending
June 30.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used mostly to retire
parent company debt and to provide working capital for the
subsidiary. The sale was made to a group of Japanese
institutional investors and is intended to position the
subsidiary for a public stock sale in Japan, Gradco said.
   Gradco's announcement was made after the close of trading.
The stock ended the day yesterday at $11 a share, up 50
cents, in national over-the-counter trading.
   The company said the revenue decline and much of the loss
on operations was due to the withdrawal of Xerox last year as
the company's largest customer. Officials said that last year
Xerox began production of a line of sorting equipment for
Xerox copiers.
   Gradco said that on Friday it filed litigation in federal
court in Los Angeles alleging that Xerox is infringing on
Gradco patents. The suit asks damages and seeks an injunction
barring production.
   Company officials said Gradco's sales to Xerox fell to $6
million in the year ended March 31 from $27 million in fiscal
1989.
   Gradco said its loss for fiscal 1990 totaled $28.1
million, or $4.02 a share, including $23 million in one-time
charges. It had net income of $5.6 million, or 88 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue slid 22% to $89.5 million in
the latest year from $115.1 million.

   RENO, Nev. -- Porsche Cars North America Inc. said it is
raising the prices of its 1991 cars, following a recent
rebound in sales. The price increase will be the company's
first in two years.
   The price of the least expensive Porsche will rise 3.5%,
to $43,350 from $41,900 a year ago. The most expensive model,
the new 911 Turbo, will sell for $95,000, compared with
$74,545 for this year's top-of-the-line Porsche models.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move by the U.S. unit of Porsche Enterprises Inc.
comes as its sales have rebounded after dropping 69% between
1986 and 1989. Sales of Porsche's luxury sports cars are up
19% for the first five months of this year.
   Separately, the U.S. sales arm of Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG said it will begin selling its entry-level 318is model
later this month at a base price of $21,500. BMW said the car
would be targeted at the growing near-luxury market.
   BMW is trying to break a slump that saw its U.S. sales
fall from a 1986 peak of 96,759 cars to 64,881 in 1989. BMW
sales for the first five months of 1990 were down 10.2%.
   "{The 318is} will certainly bring us buyers who weren't in
our market range, but it's not in direct response to
competition," said a BMW spokesman. He said the auto maker
expects to sell 7,000 of the model this year.

   NEW YORK -- American Express Co. and the Dance Theater of
Harlem announced a four-year partnership to help the
world-renowned but financially struggling dance company with
a $1 million grant and card-holder promotions.
   The dance company and American Express Travel Related
Services Co., a unit of American Express, said they plan to
jointly market the company's performances to American Express
gold card holders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After the unexpected cancellation of some European
engagements last fall, the company was forced to cancel its
winter season here and lay off its dancers for six months to
cope with a $1.7 million operating deficit. With the new
support, the company plans to resume operations on Oct. 1,
with a possible tour to Cairo this fall.
   To aid the company's expensive touring effort, American
Express said it will help find supporters for the Dance
Theater wherever it goes. "To obtain local sponsors is very
very important," an American Express spokesman said. "We will
be able to do it for them on a global basis."
   Last week DTH also received a $1 million emergency grant
from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. The grant is in
two parts, with $600,000 earmarked to reduce debts and
$400,000 for dancer salaries and operations. Last year DTH's
total payroll was $3.3 million for a staff of 140.

   Healthco set June 25 as the record date for a shareholder
consent solicitation that Gemini is making in an effort to
gain control of Healthco's board of directors. New York-based
Gemini owns just under 10% of Healthco's shares.
   Healthco said it hoped shareholders wouldn't make a
decision on the consent solicitation until it completes its
value-improvement moves. In order to elect its slate of five
candidates for Healthco's board, Gemini must obtain consents
from a majority of shareholders within 60 days from the
solicitation record date.
   Healthco said shareholders would have an opportunity to
review its value-improvement program at the annual meeting,
scheduled for Sept. 6.

   NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc. said it agreed to
sell a unit that is the general partner of American Real
Estate Partners L.P. to a Sterik Co. affiliate for $40
million.
   The general partner, American Property Investors, owns
more than 10% of American Real Estate Partners, a publicly
traded master limited partnership. AREP manages a portfolio
of more than 320 real estate properties. Sterik, based in
Auburndale, Mass., and its affiliates own more than 180
properties with a fair market value of about $500 million.
Meshulam Riklis, a financier whose Rapid American Corp. has
interests in a variety of companies, is one of Sterik's
general partners.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sale by Integrated, which is operating under Chapter
11 protection from creditors, is subject to Bankruptcy Court
approval. It is also subject to higher and better offers.
   But the agreement to sell American Property Investors may
be complicated by a lawsuit filed last month by investors in
AREP seeking to prevent any sale of the partnership without
their approval.
   The suit by Oppenheimer &amp; Bigelow Income Fund I and Edge
Partners L.P., which hold a total of about 107,000 units in
AREP, is pending in Delaware state court. It also seeks a
unit-holder list from Integrated as a possible step in
converting the partnership to a real estate investment trust,
as well as access to the books and records of the
partnership.
   Curtis Trinko, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they
intend to "move forward to obtain court relief to block" the
sale to Sterik. Mr. Trinko said the investors are considering
asking the bankruptcy court to allow some kind of vote on the
sale by the AREP limited partners.
   But Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated chairman, said he had
been advised that the partnership agreements don't require
investor approval for the sale of the general partner. He
said he didn't think the suit would delay the sale.
   Joseph Dempsey Jr., managing general partner of Sterik,
said the company would go ahead with the purchase "regardless
of the suit." Sterik has financing for the purchase.

   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered its
ratings on nearly $900 million outstanding of Western Union
Corp.'s senior secured notes, senior unsecured and
subordinated debt and preferred stock.
   The credit-rating concern downgraded Western Union's
senior secured notes, senior unsecured and subordinated debt,
and preferred stock to single-D from, respectively,
triple-C-plus, triple-C-minus and single-C. The action
affects about $642 million of debt and $254 million
liquidation value of preferred.

   Western Union, a telecommunications and financial services
company, failed to make interest payments Friday on $500
million of 19 1/4% senior secured extendible reset notes due
1992 and senior unsecured 16% notes due 1991.
   The company is seeking to restructure its debt, saying it
can't meet debt payments from current cash flow. S&amp;P said a
restructuring would greatly reduce cash debt service and
eliminate accrued dividend arrearages on the preferred.
Western Union said it hopes to complete such a restucturing
by mid-July.

   Commodities:
   Corn and Soybean Futures Contract Prices Spurt
   In Wake of Heavy Rains in Midwest at Weekend

   CHICAGO -- Prices of corn and soybean futures contracts
rose in the wake of heavy weekend rains in the Midwest.
   Analysts said the rains prevented farmers from completing
their rain-delayed planting of the soybean crop. The rains
also washed out some fields and further soaked already
waterlogged corn fields.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rally follows the steep price declines that occurred
late last week, which were brought on by profit-taking. On
Thursday and Friday, the prices of some soybean futures
contracts dropped a total of about 20 cents a bushel.
   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, the
soybean contract for July delivery rose 10 cents a bushel to
settle at $5.96 a bushel.
   The price of the corn contract for July delivery rose 3.5
cents a bushel to settle at $2.865 a bushel.
   Today, traders will study government reports released late
yesterday that showed that planting of the soybean crop is
only 79% complete nationwide. Usually, soybean planting is
88% finished by this time of the year. Corn planting wraps up
around the first of June.
   Robert Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain &amp; Livestock
Corp., Chicago, said the Agriculture Department's reports
generally fell in line with analysts' expectations.
   Sowing of soybeans is lagging particularly in Illinois,
where only 78% of the crop is planted. Normally, the soybean
planting season is finished in that state by this time of the
year.
   Because of planting delays caused by the unusually wet
spring, most crop analysts have already shaved their original
projections for a corn harvest exceeding 8.1 billion bushels.
Estimates now range from 7.4 billion to 7.8 billion bushels.
   Some traders have been expecting to see a sudden shift in
the weather this summer to hot and dry conditions. But there
isn't any sign of it yet. After the close of trading
yesterday, the National Weather Service's six to 10-day
forecast for the Midwest predicted below-normal temperatures
and normal precipitation.
   Prices of wheat futures contracts settled mixed. According
to Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., Chicago, China is interested in buying 500,000
metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat for shipment in October.
   Under a program designed to boost U.S. grain exports, the
Agriculture Department compensates exporters that ship U.S.
wheat to certain countries such as China and the Soviet
Union.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: The price of crude oil for delivery during July
fell below the important psychological level of $16 a barrel,
finishing yesterday at $15.94 as overproduction and hearty
supply continue to plague that market. The price for the OPEC
basket of crudes fell last week to $14.24, far below the $18
level cartel members had pledged to support at recent
meetings. And there doesn't appear to be any signs that
either Kuwait or the United Arab Emirates plans to reduce
production to quotas assigned them. Both have for months
flagrantly pumped far more than their alloted quotas. "Only
Saudi Arabia {of the major producers in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries} is holding back on their
output," said Nauman Barakat, first vice president, futures,
for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose. The July contract ended with
a gain of 2.10 cents a pound at $1.1390 after trading as high
as $1.1540. Prices were initially strong on unconfirmed
reports that the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea was
experiencing labor difficulties. One analyst said there
didn't appear to be any published reports but that talk of
the labor problems circulated in London and then in New York.
When the July price rose above $1.1250, fresh buying orders
were triggered, and a quick rally developed to the high of
the day. Also helping prices rise, the analyst said, were
reports that Asarco Inc.'s negotiations with the union
representing its workers had slowed over local issues. The
current contract runs out June 30. The analyst said there was
no known major risk of a strike taking place. Two other major
U.S. mining companies with contracts that also end on June 30
have recently come to agreement, greatly minimizing the
potential for any supply disruptions. Asarco also is expected
to reach agreement soon. A spokesman for Asarco said the
negotiations had been dwelling a little longer than expected
on local issues but said he had no other comment.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices again declined. The July
contract was off 3.20 cents a pound to $1.7630, for a two-day
loss of 13.85 cents. Prices traded over a 9.70-cent range, as
low as $1.70 and as high as $1.7970. At the low, the decline
represented a two-day loss of 20.15 cents. An analyst said
the selling continued from Friday, when a report circulated
that Brazilian juice processors would cut their price. The
report was later denied by the processors, but the selling
continued yesterday mostly on a technical basis, the analyst
said. However, he noted, good support developed at the $1.70
level, and the July contract recovered some of its losses.

   LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Corp. said it replaced
part of its financing package for its $1.2 billion tender
offer for MGM/UA Communications Co. and is talking with
MGM/UA about another delay in the offer closing.
   Pathe Communication's $20-a-share offer, already delayed
several times, is set to expire Friday. The original offer in
March specified a final deadline of June 23. Pathe wouldn't
say how much of an extension is now under consideration.
MGM/UA officials couldn't be reached for comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week, Pathe disclosed that it is raising about $368
million for the offer from a mix of European asset sales and
bank loans. SASEA Holding, a Swiss company of which one of
Pathe's co-chairmen is managing director, had been expected
to raise about $52 million from sales of some or all of its
Banca Agricola Milanese stock. The stock sales weren't
completed, Pathe said.
   Pathe said that SASEA has instead raised about $46 million
from the sale of some or all of its stock in Finarte
Respamio, an Italian finance company. Pathe said the balance
of the $52 million will come from sales of marketable
securities of its parent company, Comfinance S.A. Comfinance
and its European affiliates hold 88% of Pathe's stock.
   Pathe also said that talks are continuing with Time Warner
Inc. concerning Time Warner's agreement to provide $650
million toward the transaction in exchange for certain film
distribution rights and a security interest in the United
Artists film library.

   Stocks Post Fourth-Biggest Loss of Year,
   Tumbling With Exchange-Listed Shares

   Over-the-counter stocks posted their fourth-largest loss
this year as they tumbled with exchange-listed shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 6.76, or 1.45%, to 460.79,
compared with a 1.83% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. That's the largest decline since a 7.39-point drop
Jan. 30. Declining shares more than doubled advancing stocks,
1,424 to 582, as volume slipped to 157.6 million shares from
168.5 million shares Friday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The day's fall in share prices was orderly and marked by a
lack of buyers, rather than a rush of sellers, traders
agreed. "There was no panic selling," said E.E. "Buzzy"
Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc., a New York
dealer for other market professionals. Investors sold stocks
across-the-board and when they did buy, "they were very
particular," Mr. Geduld said.
   Professional dealers were active in the market, according
to William A. Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons. "The dealers are selling to take advantage of the
momentum," Mr. Rothe suggested, adding that other investors
seemed to be cautious about their next moves.
   At least one OTC trader said he found some signs of
encouragement in yesterday's fall. "I think the fact that
more people are bearish is bullish for the market," said
Richard Bruno, director of OTC trading for PaineWebber. Mr.
Bruno added that he doesn't expect the market's decline to be
prolonged.
   Software Toolworks was the day's most active stock,
dropping 4 7/8 to 19 on nearly 3.5 million shares. A negative
article in Barron's flagged a number of concerns about the
high-flying stock.
   The growing Chatsworth, Calif., software company has seen
its stock price triple in the first five months of 1990,
after tripling in 1989 from a low of $2.50 a share, amid the
prospect the company will sell Nintendo-related products.
Barron's cited the maturation and increasing competitiveness
of the Nintendo market; Software Toolwork's lackluster
outlook; insiders' plans to cash out nearly 30% of their
holdings through a secondary offering; the company's history
of growing by acquisition rather than through operating
acumen, and its possible use of aggressive accounting
practices.
   However, Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood analyst Robert F.
Kleiber advised his clients that the article painted an
"unfair picture" of the company and recommended investors buy
the stock on weakness, according to a detailed rebuttal of
the Barron's piece he sent to clients.
   Potential mergers or buy-outs sparked surges in Healthco
International, which jumped 2 1/2 to 18, and Fiserv, which
rose 2 7/8 to 29 3/8.
   After hiring an investment banker last month, Healthco, a
Boston distributor of dental supplies and equipment, said its
board decided to explore all possible alternatives, including
a possible merger or acquisition. Healthco also said there
have been recent expressions of interest in a transaction
involving the company, but didn't elaborate. The company
scheduled a shareholders meeting for Sept. 6.
   Last month, Gemini Partners L.P., which holds a 9.96%
stake in Healthco, said it intended to seek control of the
company by nominating a slate of candidates to replace the
current board.
   Fiserv, a Milwaukee provider of data processing services,
said it has been approached by a company it wouldn't identify
about a possible corporate combination. The two companies had
preliminary discussions, but Fiserv said it couldn't predict
the outcome of the talks.
   American Steel &amp; Wire was among the day's percentage
gainers with a one-point gain to 7 1/4. Friday afternoon, the
Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio, maker of steel rods and wire declared
a special cash dividend of $3.25 a share, payable June 29.
The company also said it closed on $95 million of new credit
facilities.
   On the other hand, a number of issues were pummeled after
companies reported negative earnings news.
   Silk Greenhouse slid 1 1/8, or 34.6%, to a new 52-week low
of 2 1/8 following a series of adverse news. The Tampa, Fla.,
operator of artificial flower stores reported a loss of 60
cents a share for the first quarter ended April 30, down from
net income of four cents a share a year earlier, reflecting
"substantial" increases in expenses. To curb those costs, the
company said it cut "several hundred" employees from its work
force over the past few months.
   Silk Greenhouse also announced that Chief Financial
Officer John Stokely, who joined the company in May, resigned
on June 8 and that two of its outside directors have resigned
since April 30. No replacements were named. Chairman and
President Jere Bradwell said salaries of certain senior
management, including his own, had been "reduced
significantly." Silk Greenhouse had traded as high as 10 1/8
this year and 24 1/4 within the past 52 weeks.
   IFR Systems plunged 3 1/4 to 9 1/2, or 25.4%. The Wichita,
Kan., maker of communications testing equipment predicted a
decline in profitability for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1991. The company said fiscal 1990 earnings should be in line
with estimates. However, next year's profits will be
pressured by changes in the timing of deliveries under its
Sincgars Army contract, higher production costs for initial
deliveries under the contract, and an acceleration in
research and development and related manufacturing expenses.
   J&amp;J Snack Foods tumbled 2 1/8 to 7 7/8, a 21% decline,
after the Pennsauken, N.J., maker of frozen snack foods said
late Friday it expects earnings for the third quarter ending
June 30 will be lower than the 21 cents a share earned a year
earlier, although sales will be higher. J&amp;J said higher costs
and disappointing retail supermarket sales have hurt
earnings.
   First Commerce dropped 2 1/8 to 19 after the New
Orleans-based bank holding company said late Friday it
expects earnings for the second quarter to be 35 cents to 40
cents a share, down from 58 cents a share a year earlier. The
bank also said it expects provisions for loan losses will be
about $12 million for the second quarter, up from $8 million
in the first quarter and $5 million in the year-earlier
period.
   CSP fell 1 to 5 5/8 after the Billerica, Mass., maker of
array processors and related computer software and hardware
processors reported net income for the third quarter ended
May 31 of a penny a share, down from eight cents a share a
year earlier.
   Multibank Financial eased 3/4 to 11 1/4 after the Dedham,
Mass., commercial bank said late Friday that about $30
million of additions to its loan-loss reserves for the second
quarter ending in June will result in a loss of $11 million
for the second quarter and a loss of $8.1 million for the
first six months of 1990. Multibank reported net income of
$7.4 million, or 79 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter and of $14.1 million, or $1.51 a share, for the first
six months of 1989.

per-share earnings for that period.

   Has 7 `Major Problems,'

   WASHINGTON -- Bush administration officials plan to
recommend a veto of legislation that would overhaul federal
housing programs, partly because the bill would allow new
federally financed housing construction.
   A draft of a statement threatening a veto outlined seven
"major problems" the administration has with the National
Affordable Housing Act. The draft, being prepared by housing
and budget officials, said the bill's Housing Opportunity
Partnerships would create a "costly, poorly targeted new
housing construction program" that wouldn't meet the needs of
the poor. The bill's sponsor said it emphasizes that housing
rehabilitation is a priority but permits new construction
where necessary.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp previously has voiced
objections to the bill, but this would be the first time the
administration issued a veto threat on the bill.
   Mary Brunette, a top assistant to Secretary Kemp, said the
administration is "certainly prepared to offer a veto" if
there is no resolution of certain issues, including what
administration officials consider inadequate funding for Mr.
Kemp's plan to encourage home ownership by low-income
families.
   Administration officials also object to the bill because,
according to the draft statement, it would: require
one-for-one replacement of public housing units that are
sold; include "excessive funding" for Farmers Home
Administration new rural housing construction direct loans;
and defer mortgage payments for very low-income borrowers.
   The officials also complained that the bill exceeds the
administration's housing budget for the Agriculture and
Housing and Urban Development departments by $5 billion for
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   If the bill "were presented to the president in its
current form, his senior advisers would recommend that the
bill be vetoed," reads the draft statement.
   The administration apparently decided to send a veto
threat to the Senate after Mr. Kemp and White House Budget
Director Richard Darman met with the bill's sponsor,
California Democrat Alan Cranston, yesterday morning.
   During a midday news conference, Sen. Cranston was
optimistic that differences between the Senate and the
administration would be resolved. He said Mr. Kemp
specifically indicated the administration wasn't threatening
a veto at that time. Negotiations among the budget office,
HUD and Senate staff members yesterday afternoon, however,
did little to resolve the disagreements. An administration
official said the bill is seriously deficient.
   Donald Campbell, staff director of the Senate's Housing
subcommittee, said a letter sent to Mr. Cranston from Mr.
Kemp last week indicates the administration has a "gross
misunderstanding" of what the bill would do.

   Fan-Disk Crack
   Tied to Jet Crash
   Passed Inspection

   WASHINGTON -- The National Transportation Safety Board
said it believes the fan-disk fatigue crack that led to the
crash of a United Airlines jet in Iowa was "of a detectable
size" at the time of a major inspection before last July's
accident.
   But the board said it hasn't determined whether the crack
went undiscovered because the inspection was improperly done
or the inspection method was inadequate. In any case, it
called on the Federal Aviation Administration to develop
improved inspection methods -- perhaps involving electrical
current -- for detecting surface cracks in the fan disks of
General Electric Co.'s CF6-6 engines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Anthony Broderick, associate FAA administrator for
certification and regulation, said that he hadn't seen the
NTSB recommendation but that agency engineers will examine
it. "Certainly, we can always improve our inspection
techniques," he said. But Mr. Broderick added that he
believes it's an open question whether the crack was
detectable. "As in many accidents, technical people could
debate this for a long time," he said.
   The safety board hasn't yet issued its final report on the
July 19 crash of a DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, that killed 112
people on board. Investigators have already concluded that a
crack resulting from a metal impurity caused the fan disk to
fly apart. Shrapnel-like pieces sliced through the plane's
hydraulic lines, making the plane almost uncontrollable. The
aircraft crashed during an emergency landing.
   The standard procedure for detecting surface cracks is
called a fluorescent penetrant inspection. The disk is
covered with a fluorescent liquid, then washed off, dusted
with a chemical developer and examined under fluorescent
light. Cracks typically show up as a result of absorbing and
retaining the liquid.
   In an inspection that took place 760 flights before the
accident, the NTSB said, United used this procedure, but
didn't discover the crack.
   "The safety board's investigation has revealed evidence
suggesting that, at the time of this fluorescent penetrant
inspection, the crack was of a detectable size," NTSB
Chairman James Kolstad said in a letter to FAA Administrator
James Busey.
   But Rob Doughty, a spokesman for United, said the airline
hasn't any reason to believe that the crack was detectable at
the time of the inspection. He said he hadn't seen the NTSB
letter.
   After the accident, the FAA ordered ultrasonic inspections
on the engines like the ones that were on the plane that
crashed. But the board, in its letter yesterday, said it was
concerned that the ultrasonic inspection wouldn't detect
surface cracks. It said the FAA should develop a method using
electrical currents, called an eddy current inspection, to
detect surface cracks.
   In a separate action, the board recommended that the FAA
beef up its equipment for detecting wind-shear, a sharp
change in wind speed and direction that can be extremely
dangerous during aircraft takeoffs and landings.

   Darman Steps Up Pressure on Congress
   For Budget Accord in Next Two Weeks

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Budget Director Richard Darman stepped up
pressure on Congress to cut a budget deal with the White
House in the next two weeks.
   Mr. Darman said he expected serious talks between the
administration and Congress to begin as early as tomorrow,
including a discussion of taxes. He stressed the importance
of reaching an agreement before Congress leaves for its July
Fourth holiday, saying that's probably "necessary to get a
deal done in a sensible fashion."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Darman also said it is important to put the agreement
into legislation before Congress leaves for its August
recess. "That is a real midnight hour," he said in response
to questions at a lunch with reporters.
   In addition, the budget director said failure to enact a
budget agreement by mid-October would lead to automatic
spending cuts of $80 billion. The Gramm-Rudman budget law
mandates across-the-board cuts, called a sequester, if
deficit targets aren't met. "The sequester size this time
around is so large," he said, "that it cannot be managed by
tinkering with economic assumptions or technical
assumptions." Although large, the $80 billion figure is
smaller than some previous estimates Mr. Darman has
mentioned.
   Democrats, including House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri who heads the talks, also have been
saying that the next two weeks are crucial. After a month of
meetings without any progress toward a deficit-reduction
package, they say the wisdom of agreeing to closed-door,
bipartisan negotiations will be in doubt unless there is
discernible progress soon.
   But Democratic leaders also say it now is up to the
president to propose a solution to the problem that Mr.
Darman outlines, and they show no willingness to let the
president off the hook. "It isn't enough for the president to
fire a starting pistol and then step back and provide no
other leadership or impetus," said Sen. Wyche Fowler (D.,
Ga.), who is Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell's
delegate to the talks. "The president hasn't prepared the
public for the strong medicine that he is asking us to
produce."
   He added, "Mr. Darman has the pulpit and he's got all the
choir books. When he wants to pass out his proposals to the
choir, then we'll see if we can find a tune that we can all
sing on."
   Some Democrats also dismissed Mr. Darman's deadline. "I
don't think if we fail to get an agreement before July Fourth
that this whole coach turns into a pumpkin," said Sen. James
Sasser (D., Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
"We're still going to be around here. We've got sufficient
time after that to work toward an agreement."
   Mr. Darman wouldn't say whether the administration would
put forward a deficit-cutting proposal this week, as the
Democrats have requested. "We've taken that issue under
advisement and don't either have an answer at the moment or
wish to make a big issue of it," he said.
   But he predicted that one of three things will occur this
week: the administration puts a proposal on the table,
negotiators "invent a mechanism to get things on the table .
. . without authorship" or "people say, having failed at
those two things, `Let's break up.'"
   The government has until mid-October to complete action on
a budget package before the Gramm-Rudman budget law's harsh
automatic spending cuts. But Mr. Darman and congressional
leaders appear anxious to complete a budget agreement well
before then.
   Mr. Darman argued that completing a deal before August is
important because Congress will have to vote for an increase
in the national debt limit before lawmakers leave for their
August recess. Debt-limit increases are always controversial
and in the past have been vehicles for troublesome
budget-related legislation.
   In addition, the administration and members of Congress
worry that if they wait until September, lawmakers may be
focused on the November elections and unwilling to approve
the tough spending cuts and tax increases necessary to close
the budget gap.
   The budget director also said he planned to speed up the
release of the details of across-the-board cuts "to help
people focus on that." He said he would put the details out
July 15, rather than Aug. 25, as required by the budget law.
   While some conservatives have argued that the
administration should let automatic spending cuts take effect
in October, Mr. Darman made it clear that that's not an
acceptable alternative. He said a $60 billion sequester would
force the Bureau of Prisons, for instance, to furlough 5,600
prisoners and would increase current prison overcrowding
"from 68% to 84%." And he said the cuts would lead to
reductions in air-traffic control personnel, resulting in an
"increase in the delays to travelers by 400% to 600%."
   Asked whether there's a possibility of reaching a
big-enough budget pact without raising taxes, Mr. Darman
said, "There is on paper. Whether there is as a negotiating
matter remains to be determined."

   Motorola Faces
   Ban on Selling
   Leading Chip

<LP>
   In a decision that poses a grave threat to Motorola Inc.
and several U.S. computer makers, a federal judge in Texas
has decided to impose an earlier ruling that ordered Motorola
to stop selling its most successful computer chip.
   The decision harks back to a ruling made in March, in
which a federal district judge in Austin, Texas, ordered
Motorola to stop selling its 68030 chip because it infringed
on patents held by Japan's Hitachi Ltd. The ruling also found
Hitachi in violation of certain Motorola patents. The judge
then issued a stay of the injunction, allowing Motorola and
Hitachi to keep selling their chips.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The judge yesterday disclosed his intent to lift the stay,
Motorola and Hitachi officials said. The judge hadn't yet
signed the order yesterday but is scheduled to do so today, a
Hitachi official said.
   If enforced, the decision could be disastrous for
Motorola, which would be forced immediately to stop selling
its flagship 68030 microprocessor chip, used in powerful
computers made by such companies as Apple Computer Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. The 68030 chip is the "brains" of many of
Apple's Macintosh machines.
   Motorola officials said in a written statement that it
will file an emergency appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals
to stay the injunction. The ruling "might temporarily prevent
the company from selling its market-leading 68030," the
statement said. Motorola is "confident" that the appeals
court will "promptly stay the lower court's decision, pending
appeal."
   A Hitachi official said that "Hitachi is continuing to
meet {with Motorola} in an effort to reach a negotiated
settlement" with Motorola. "We want to do all we can toward
reaching a settlement," he said.
   Hitachi has little to lose. The giant conglomerate, which
requested the lifting of the stay, won't be hurt much by the
injunction because it sells few of the chips in the U.S. that
were found to be violating Motorola patents. "There will be
very little effect on Hitachi," the Hitachi official said. In
fact, many U.S. chip executives say Hitachi has the upper
hand in any negotiations and may be using the injunction to
get more favorable treatment from Motorola.
   The ruling could also hurt Apple and others that use the
chip, which only Motorola makes. Companies in March said they
had several months' worth of stockpiles of the vital chip,
but some warned Motorola that they would be angered by a
cutoff of supply. An Apple spokesman said the company
couldn't comment on yesterday's news until it had seen a copy
of the formal ruling.
   A Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said the company wouldn't be
affected because it has a license to use the Hitachi patent
and to commission chip makers to make semiconductors for
Hewlett-Packard that use the patent.
   The ruling is the latest twist in an 18-month
trans-Pacific patent battle, started by Motorola, in which
Motorola and Hitachi have launched a barrage of suits and
countersuits. The March ruling, in which the judge chided the
companies for not agreeing out of court, backfired against
Motorola, shocked the computer industry and even caused one
user of the chip to guard its stockpiles with extra security
guards.
   Motorola also said yesterday that the U.S. Patent Office
agreed last week to reexamine Hitachi's patent, which
Motorola claims is invalid on the basis of a 1966 patent. The
patent office has found that "a substantial new question
about {the} Hitachi patent has been raised which has a direct
bearing on the outcome of this case," the Motorola statement
said.

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said it sued eight
corporations, including Westinghouse Electric Corp. and
Potlatch Corp., for allegedly polluting the coastal waters
off Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif.
   Named in the suit, along with Pittsburgh-based
Westinghouse and San Francisco-based Potlatch, were Montrose
Chemical Corp., Wilmington, Del.; ICI Inc., a unit of
Imperial Chemical Industries PLC of Britain; the Stauffer
Chemical unit of Rhone-Poulenc Inc.; Chris-Craft Industries
Inc., New York; Simpson Paper Co., San Francisco; and a
property owner named Atkemix 37 Inc., said the department's
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The NOAA alleged that the companies dumped the pesticide
DDT and hazardous chemicals known as polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs, from factories into sewers that emptied
into Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors and onto the Palos
Verdes Shelf off the Southern California coast.
   The contamination dates to the 1940s, the NOAA said, and
has injured fish, marine mammals and seabirds. For example,
the agency said that bottlenose dolphins and California sea
lions have higher concentrations of DDT and PCBs than any
other marine animals it has studied.
   The NOAA said the companies could be required to pay tens
of millions of dollars to restore the coastal waters and
habitat. Restoration could include removal or treatment of
underwater sediments, restocking fish or installing
artificial reefs.
   Mark Eames, an NOAA attorney, said that five of the
companies -- ICI, Chris-Craft, Montrose, Stauffer and Atkemix
-- were involved in a DDT-manufacturing plant near Torrance,
Calif., that closed in 1982. Westinghouse operates an
electric-equipment repair facility in Compton, Calif., that
Mr. Eames said releases PCBs. Simpson runs a paper-recycling
plant in Pomona, Calif., that he said also produces PCBs.
Simpson bought the plant from Potlatch.
   In January, the NOAA informed the companies cited, as well
as several others, that it might sue them. The agency said it
hadn't yet decided whether to sue the Los Angeles County
sanitation districts, which operate the sewers that carried
the chemicals. The NOAA was joined in the lawsuit by the
Interior Department and the state of California.
   Mr. Eames said this is the third action it has brought for
allegedly polluting coastal waters and harming fish and
wildlife. The first suit, involving the New Bedford, Mass.,
harbor, was brought in 1983; the second, involving Seattle,
was brought this year. Neither has been resolved.
   Montrose, Simpson Paper, Chris-Craft and Potlatch couldn't
immediately be reached for comment.
   Westinghouse previously said it was unable to "react or
comment" on the allegations because the company "doesn't know
what they (NOAA) are talking about." A Rhone-Poulenc
spokesman said earlier that none of the company's operations
caused any of the alleged pollution. She said the NOAA may be
confused because different pieces of Stauffer Chemical have
been acquired by various companies in recent years. The piece
bought by Rhone-Poulenc is now known as Rhone-Poulenc Basic
Chemicals and is based in Shelton, Conn.
   A spokesman for ICI previously said that the company was
still reviewing the NOAA allegations and couldn't comment.

   Discount Department Stores Struggle
   Against Rivals That Strike Aisle by Aisle

   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Discount department stores are
feeling the sting of a formidable rival, the "category
killer," and Henry Beckersley is one shopper who understands
why.
   Out to buy a new color television, Mr. Beckersley first
went to the Ames discount department store here. Even though
Ames had just seven different models, he found a 20-inch RCA
he liked for $339. But when he couldn't find a salesperson to
demonstrate it, he went to a nearby Highland Superstore.
Specializing in electronics, Highland offered more than 200
models, including the same RCA -- this time for $228. And a
salesman was happy to explain the features.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I didn't know Highland was such a good deal," he says
loading the television into his car. "Next time, I know."
   More and more, once-loyal customers of discount department
stores are spending their money at specialty discounters, or
what the industry calls "category killers." Where traditional
discounters such as Ames Department Stores Inc., K mart
Corp., Caldor Inc. and others sell a huge range of goods,
category killers focus on one area of product, such as toys,
electronics or books, offering wider selections and steeper
price cuts. These specialty discounters include companies
such as Crown Books Corp., Toys "R" Us Inc., Staples Inc., a
stationery discounter, and Streamers, a discount party-supply
chain.
   "The competition's crazy," laments John Dunphey, manager
at a Caldor discount department store here. "Executives from
all these chains are in our store every week checking out our
prices; we're in theirs, too, doing the same thing."
   Not too long ago, discount department stores were among
the fastest growing retailers. Now, many are fiscally
tottering. Within the past 13 months, Ames, Maxway, Gee Bee,
a division of Glosser Bros., Heck's Inc., Alco and
Yellowfront Stores Inc. all have filed for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Three others,
Gold Circle, Mars Department Stores and Times Square Stores,
no longer exist at all.
   Analysts say traditional discounters are caught in a
Darwinian struggle, and only a few will survive. A few years
ago, the three largest discounters owned 40% of the cut-price
market, says David Poneman, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co. Today those Big Three -- Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., K mart and Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target stores -- do
60% of the estimated $90 billion discount department-store
business. The three chains accounted for most of the
industry's $10 billion sales gain in 1989. The 11% sales
increase pales in comparison to the high double-digit jumps
that the industry saw a decade ago.
   "I think 10 years down the road there will only be three
or four discount chains left in the business," predicts Peter
Monash, head of Monash &amp; Associates, a retail research firm
in Columbus, Ohio.
   The Big Three discounters appear to be holding their own
against the specialty discounters. Wal-Mart, with nearly $26
billion in sales last year, uses its buying clout and new
technology for inventory tracking and bookkeeping to run one
of the leanest discount operations. The Bentonville, Ark.,
retailer is also helped by the fact that most of its stores
are in smaller and less competitive cities. Minneapolis-based
Target has managed to promote an image as a "better"
discounter, attracting a slightly more upscale customer. K
mart, based in Troy, Mich., operates in tougher urban markets
and has been touched more by the competition. Sales in stores
more than one year old have lagged behind inflation.
   Overall, some industry watchers say the discount
department store as a genre may have outlived the simpler era
for which it was built. When they came into being in the
1950s, chains were structured for housewives, who bought most
of the household supplies, says Leo Shapiro, chairman of Leo
Shapiro &amp; Associates, a retailing researcher in Chicago.
"Once a week she drove down in the family station wagon to
the general merchandise discount store knowing she could get
baby clothes in one aisle and hammers two aisles down.
   "Today, with everyone pressed for time," Mr. Shapiro says,
"family members shop for themselves." And they often head out
in search of one particular item, not a range of household
goods. "If they want to buy toys, they go to Toys "R" Us; if
they want to buy paper plates they go to Streamers," Mr.
Shapiro says.
   Defecting customers point to a number of drawbacks with
general merchandise discounters: Small selections in any one
category, disheveled displays, hard-to-find salespeople, long
checkout lines. But price is probably the biggest
consideration. With a few exceptions, category killers have
lower prices than discount department stores because buying a
lot of one kind of product gives them more clout with
manufacturers and distributors.
   The specialty-discounter challenge to traditional
discounters is apparent here in Framingham, where some 100
stores are sprawled across four adjacent malls.
   CVS, Melville Corp.'s drug-store chain, sells a roll of
35mm, 24 exposure Kodak film for $2.49, compared with $3.19
at Bradlees, $3.59 at Ames, $3.49 at Caldor. Similarly, a
shopper can buy a 24-ounce bottle of Listerine at CVS for
$2.88, compared with $3.49 to $3.99 elsewhere. At Lechmere
Inc., a discount appliance, housewares and sporting goods
store, a Hoover Tempo vacuum cleaner sells for $124.98; the
same model at Bradlees costs $139.
   The other day Jon Andrade was stalking the aisles at
Bradlees here, looking for "Pet Sematary," a Stephen King
best seller. He stalked right out. The paperback was
available only as part of an $18.95 four-book gift package. A
few minutes away at Lauriat's Bookstore, he snapped up the
novel for $3.69. Mr. Andrade says he now knows: "When buying
books, go to a bookstore. It's cheaper and quicker."
   John and Micah Oberling of Framingham, hunting for a baby
bath at a Bradlees discount store, gave up because it had
only one kind. Across the street, they found what they wanted
at Toys "R" Us, which had three choices -- all costing less.
   Some discounters are trying to adapt to new shopping
styles. A few have experimented with housing a store within a
store, trying to cash in on the specialty-store idea. Some
include home-office sections or supermarkets. In addition to
its grocery section, Wal-Mart operates Sam's Wholesale Club,
a chain of warehouse-like stores in which merchandise often
is left in shipping crates. K mart has bought a few category
killers, such as Sports Authority, a sporting goods
specialist.
   On the other hand, Zayre Corp. two years ago dropped out
of the discount department store business, selling its chain
to Ames. Now, it has turned its attention solely to the
specialty store business. ("It was the smartest move the
company ever made," comments Kurt Barnard, publisher of
Retail Marketing Report, a New York-based newsletter.)
   Not everyone is ready to kiss off discount stores, though.
"I think the general discount department store and the
specialty discount store can co-exist peacefully," notes
Edward Comeau, an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "It's a
question of finding niches" -- and handling them well.
   Caldor, a former May Department Stores Co. subsidiary
taken private by a management group, says it is conceding the
big-ticket items to specialty discounters, and concentrating
on clothing, knickknacks, home products and small appliances,
the way Target stores do. Marc Balmuth, president of the
chain, based in Norwalk, Conn., says: "Toys "R" Us, and
Staples does $60 a ticket. If you're coming in to pick up a
few things for the house, Caldor will be the neighborhood
store to shop in."
   With this mentality -- and a $750,000 face lift -- the
Caldor store in Framingham hopes to increase sales to about
$15 million this year. The store has been doing about $11
million in annual sales, about $3 million dollars less than a
typical Caldor store.
   Traditional discounters also are trying to get out of the
bind they got into with schizophrenic pricing. Constant sale
days led many to switch to "everyday low prices," yet many
continue to run special promotions. In the end, the consumer
has wound up confused.
   Caught in a fierce contest with a growing crop of nearby
specialty stores, the Ames store in Milford, N.H., attempted
to combine "everyday low prices" with specially advertised
promotions. The result: sales declined 18%, when they had
been expected to increase 10%.
   Richard Cristo, the store's manager, isn't optimistic
things will change. "Let's face it, {specialty discounters}
have got a lot better pricing and greater variety," he says,
adding: "The other day I got a letter from my niece. She
tells me, `you're in the wrong business, get out.' You know,
she's right. I don't see an element of security in what I'm
doing."

   Novell Plans to Tighten Security Features
   To Protect Computer Users From Snoops

   Novell Inc. plans to toughen the security features of its
network software products, responding to growing concerns
that personal computer networks are vulnerable to disruption
by electronic intruders.
   The Provo, Utah, company already offers limited security
features in its current networking products, which are widely
used by industry. But it is starting to incorporate into
Netware, its main software family, a more sophisticated
approach to security called public-key encryption. The method
enables many people to encrypt messages in such a way that
only one person can decipher them. It also allows one person
to send an encrypted message that numerous recipients can
understand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To improve the security features of its products, Novell
said yesterday that on Friday it signed a license agreement
covering public-key technology from RSA Data Security Inc., a
closely held Redwood City, Calif., concern. RSA is generally
believed to sell the most efficient public-key software, and
it controls a key U.S. patent underlying its products.
   "We considered doing this on our own . . . for about 10
minutes," said Richard King, Novell's vice president of
software development. "There are some things you can roll
your own on, but not this."
   Mr. King said Novell would release its first product using
public-key techniques by the end of July. The product, called
Netware NameService, is designed to shorten the time it takes
for personal-computer users to access central computers on
the network where shared files and sensitive data are stored.
Novell's products now require a user to punch in a new
password for each server they wish to log onto. NameService
will make a single password work for all the network's
central computers.
   Novell is the first important supplier of networking
software to embrace public-key cryptography, which has been a
controversial subject since its creation by a group of
academic researchers in the late 1970s.
   Because it can afford security against intrusion normally
reserved for highly-sensitive government operations,
public-key has been an irritant to the National Security
Agency, which has complained that spread of public-key
cryptography will make it harder for the agency to monitor
secret transmissions. U.S. law allows the sale of public-key
products but restricts their export.
   Supporters say public-key can reduce the threat of
computer network disruptions by limiting the spread of rogue
programs, and making it possible for recipients of electronic
messages to be sure they have received an authentic
communication.
   "Right now there's nothing in the way of privacy or
authentication" for users of many PC networks, said Ralph
Merkle, a researcher at Xerox Corp.
   Nevertheless, some security specialists are skeptical
about the commercial prospects for products using public-key
techniques, such as the ones planned by Novell. "Significant
customer demand for (improved security) has just not appeared
yet," said Donn Parker, an electronic security consultant at
SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif. Mr. Parker predicted
it would take several years for public-key demand to mature.
   Novell, however, hopes its aggressive stand on security
will give its products an advantage. "It's a feature that
will stand out," said Mr. King. "It shows people we're really
concerned about the integrity of their systems."
   While the use of public-key remains small compared with
traditional "one-way" cryptography, it is catching on with
high-technology firms. Last year, Digital Equipment Corp.
signed a licensing deal with RSA Data and Lotus Development
Corp. introduced a software package called Notes that partly
relies on RSA Data's techniques.

   NORTH PLATTE, Neb. -- This isolated town of 25,000 people,
located between the clay and sand hills of central Nebraska,
is in a way the heart of America: It's the site of one of the
world's largest railroad yards, where the big freight trains
from the east and west coasts meet.
   But even here in the heartland, a mini-invasion of
Japanese is under way. Japanese investors bought a cattle
ranch in nearby Brady last year, touching off a ruckus that
still hasn't abated.
   "I know how them Orientals think," says William Thanel,
standing inside his gas station. "When we lose this land, you
can't buy it back from them. It will go from generation to
generation. You'll never get it back."
   "Pretty soon they're going to be taking us over," agrees
Helen Higginbotham, as she pours a cup of coffee at Roger's
diner. "That's what I'm worried about."
   Like fast-growing kudzu vines, Japanese money is spreading
across America, buying up tens of billions of dollars in
Treasury bonds and sewage-treatment plants, skyscrapers and
ski resorts, grain elevators and golf courses. Japanese
investment in U.S. real estate has increased sevenfold since
1985, while investment in manufacturing leaped to $12 billion
from $3 billion in the same period.
   The purchases have included high-profile "trophies," such
as Columbia Pictures and a controlling interest in
Rockefeller Center, and show little sign of slowing. Unlike
the short-lived, oil-fueled Arab investment boom of the
1970s, this one is driven by more fundamental causes. High
savings rates in Japan have left the newly wealthy Japanese
with huge quantities of money to spread around the globe. Low
American savings rates, combined with huge budget deficits,
have left the U.S. dependent on those funds.
   Moreover, the dollar's steep decline in the last five
years has turned the U.S. into a bargain basement for the
Japanese. Relatively low land and food prices and even wages
make the U.S. seem almost like a Third World nation in
comparison to Japan. Susumu Ohara, a Japanese newspaper
executive in New York, says he arranges to get menus with no
prices when treating guests from Tokyo at one of New York's
most expensive Japanese restaurants. If his guests saw the
prices, he says, they would think him a cheapskate.
   This deluge of Japanese money heightens the economic
uncertainties gnawing at America. For decades, Americans have
been investing heavily overseas and assuring concerned
foreigners that they would benefit from the investments. Now
that the shoe is on the other foot, Americans don't like it
at all. In a recent nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll, 69% of registered voters said the Japanese already
invest "too much" in the United States. In North Carolina, a
group called "Help Save America for Our Kids' Future" sends
out mailings claiming that "Japanism" has replaced communism
as the major threat to the country.
   Will Japanese money change the face of America, and will
the U.S. thereby lose control over its own destiny and its
influence abroad? That, more than the trade deficit, will be
the issue at the center of U.S.-Japan relations for the next
decade.
   There is little question that the nation's future would be
more secure if it could rely on its own capital. But as long
as Americans save so little, that option is closed. "Better
American capital than Japanese capital," says Harvard
economist Lawrence Summers, "but better Japanese capital than
no capital at all."
   Less clear is whether Japanese investment is more
worrisome than other foreign capital. Economists tend to
assume business people and investors around the globe are
motivated by the same consideration of the bottom line. But
some close observers of Japan insist the Japanese have
developed a different, more threatening breed of capitalism
-- one driven as much by national goals as individual profit.
   "The Japanese have a much stronger sense of `we' and
`they' than Americans" and they are "importing their
insularity into the U.S," says Ivan Hall, a professor at
Gakushuin University in Tokyo. American employees of Japanese
companies, for example, complain their opportunities for
advancement are slim. And American companies say Japanese
firms here favor suppliers from Japan over those in the U.S.
In addition, some observers worry that Japanese companies
work to keep knowledge-intensive, high-paying jobs at home
while situating lower-skilled jobs in the U.S. The observers
also fear that during a global downturn, the Japanese might
shift the burden of unemployment to the U.S. and away from
their own country.
   In the end, warns C. Tait Ratcliffe, a Tokyo-based
American economist and consultant, "Japan could adopt a sort
of industrial policy for the U.S. through its investments,"
deciding "which industries are appropriate for America."
   Many economists argue that Japanese investment is a
blessing, holding down interest rates and creating jobs.
Moreover, some commentators say that in the new global
market, ownership no longer matters. Harvard professor Robert
Reich argues that it is much healthier to have Sony
television sets made in the U.S. than Zenith televisions made
in Mexico.
   But as the Journal/NBC poll shows, most ordinary Americans
don't accept that sanguine view. "If you think ownership
doesn't matter," says Chalmers Johnson, a Japan specialist at
the University of California at San Diego, "you are not
playing the capitalism game any more."
   Here in rural Nebraska, ownership does still matter, and
ownership by the Japanese sparks a special ire. "The Japanese
are highly visible, highly successful, and everybody is
envious of their wealth," says Don Bratten, a local
stockbroker. Sentiment is so strong that, after the Japanese
purchased the ranch in Brady, the local district attorney
dusted off a 100-year-old law barring sale of farm land to
"aliens" and filed a suit, now pending, demanding that the
ranch be sold to the state.
   George Kuroki sees an element of racism in the dispute.
"That law has been ignored for 100 years," says Mr. Kuroki, a
third-generation Japanese-American whose family came to this
area decades ago. At age 83, he has lived and worked as a
farmer here all his life, but still decorates his house with
Japanese prints and designs. "Why, because a Japanese
national buys it, do they bring it up?" he asks of the old
law.
   There is also a feeling in North Platte and elsewhere in
the U.S. that the Japanese play by different rules. "All they
are going to do with this land is raise beef and ship it to
Japan," complains Robert Hill, a railroad worker. "They need
to participate more in our society."
   Do the Japanese play by different rules? When Michigan
State University economist Mordechai Kreinin studied the
Australian operations of 62 multinational companies -- 42 of
them owned by U.S. or European interests, 20 by Japanese --
his findings were stark. Factories owned by American
companies, and to a slightly lesser extent European firms,
contained equipment made in America, Japan and a variety of
European countries, without a pronounced national pattern. By
contrast, the "overwhelming preponderance" of the equipment
used in Japanese-owned factories came from Japan, he wrote in
The World Economy, a British journal.
   "The Japanese are different," Mr. Kreinin says in an
interview. "When an American or European company buys
machinery to set up a plant, they take competitive bids. But
the Japanese go directly to Japan." He attributes this partly
to tradition, and partly to the so-called "keiretsu" --
large, loosely organized groups of companies in Japan that
own each other's stock and tend to buy from each other.
   American construction companies are among those that have
most keenly felt the impact of this tendency to Buy Japanese.
They complain that while American firms building facilities
in Japan generally use Japanese prime contractors, Japanese
companies here don't reciprocate; instead, they generally use
Japanese contractors.
   It's the same story in the auto-parts business. Even
though Japanese auto makers now produce more than a million
vehicles a year in the U.S., most of the parts still come
from Japanese manufacturers. Japanese auto makers have
repeatedly promised to buy U.S. parts, and some of them now
have set numerical targets for U.S. purchases. So far,
though, the targets are small and the progress slow.
   All told, according to Norman Glickman and Douglas
Woodward, authors of a recent book on foreign investment in
the U.S., Japanese-affiliated companies in the U.S. imported
$71.1 billion worth of goods in 1987 while exporting only
$20.8 billion of goods. The difference -- about $50 billion
-- was about the size of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan
that year.
   Mr. Kreinin's Australian study found that, in addition to
preferring Japanese suppliers, Japanese multinationals are
far more likely to rely on managers from home. Most Western
operations he examined were managed entirely by Australians.
Only one of the 20 Japanese operations was wholly
Australian-run. Even when Australian managers were used, they
were often shadowed by Japanese "advisers" who exercised the
real power.
   Japanese government statistics partially support his
point. They show that 45% of the top officials and 85% of the
chief executives of Japanese companies' overseas subsidiaries
are Japanese. Only 20% of the top officials of foreign units
in Japan are sent by the home office.
   At a Chinese restaurant in Tokyo's Roppongi district, five
young Westerners who work in Japanese corporations also seem
to endorse Mr. Kreinin's finding. They are members of the
Kaisha Society, a group formed to allow foreigners in
Japanese companies to share their experiences.
   Alexander Muromcew is one of the group. He studied
Japanese in Japan during and after his undergraduate years at
Dartmouth College, and ultimately joined Mitsui &amp; Co., a big
Japanese trading company, in New York. But the energetic
young man quickly became discouraged. None of the top
executives of the company, and fewer than 10% of the general
managers, were Americans. After he was sent to Tokyo, he
says, the company union explained to him just how different
his employment status was from that of his Japanese
colleagues. He found that he was on a separate track to
nowhere.
   Mr. Muromcew says Mitsui is trying to improve conditions
for foreigners, but he decided not to hold his breath: Last
week, he left the company. His advice to Americans who face
the prospect of working for Japanese companies in the U.S.:
"You're going to be discriminated against. Do you want to be
a second-class citizen in your own country?"
   In Tokyo, a Mitsui spokesman says the company is working
hard to increase the number of foreign managers in its employ
and to give overseas employees more opportunity to rise in
the company.
   Peter Douglas, a Briton and another member of the Kaisha
Society, is more upbeat. He admires Japanese business
practices and enjoys Tokyo. But even he doesn't see much of a
future for foreign managers. "You can learn good techniques
in a Japanese company, but they don't promote foreigners."
   Japanese companies say one problem they face in moving
ambitious foreigners up the ladder is finding people who
speak their language well enough. Moreover, even foreigners
proficient in the language may find the keenly formal
corporate culture in Japanese companies difficult to grasp. A
booklet handed to new employees by Dai-ichi Life Insurance
Co., for instance, includes complicated instructions on how
to stand with superiors on an elevator, how to behave during
golf games and how to express one's will without being too
direct. There's even a section entitled, "Funeral: Most
Serious Business Scene."
   As for their operations in the U.S., certainly some
Japanese companies are trying to mollify their hosts. When
Americans complained that Japanese operations in the U.S.
didn't contribute much to local charities, Japan's government
began mulling a tax break for overseas philanthropy. And when
Americans complained that the Japanese hired too few
minorities and were insensitive to the concerns of blacks,
Keidanren, Japan's big business group, helped produce a
Japanese-television version of "Eyes on the Prize," a PBS
documentary on the civil-rights movement.
   In some cases, at least, the efforts seem to be paying
off. Elaine Jolissant, an engineer at a computer-peripherals
factory in Hillsboro, Ore., owned by Fujitsu Ltd., was
hesitant to work for a Japanese company, fearing that its
"culture isn't designed for women yet." She now insists it
was an unfounded worry. "It turned out to be exactly the
opposite," she says. "They were very kind and respectful
toward me just like everybody else."
   Fujitsu has no Americans in top management, but its
Hillsboro facility is run largely by non-Japanese. And while
the plant doesn't formally promise Japanese-style "lifetime"
jobs, employees there feel secure. By contrast, Mrs.
Jolissant says the American-owned company she left to take
the Fujitsu job closed its operations a year later and moved
them to Taiwan.
   Still, even in Hillsboro, concern about the Japanese is
apparent. A poll last year by William Watts, a Washington
consultant, found the town evenly split over whether foreign
investment is good or bad. And a visit to McMenamin's pub at
the edge of the town makes it clear that critics of Japan
aren't hard to find.
   "Right now, it's good for the economy," says Pete
Batchelor, drinking a beer. "But in the long run, I don't
know."
   "We ought to stick with American companies," adds his
drinking companion, Tom Simpson. "This is America."
   Try as they might to become better U.S. corporate
citizens, Japanese companies sometimes botch it. Calsonic
Manufacturing Corp., a Japanese auto parts supplier that has
a factory in Shelbyville, Tenn., donated $2 million to help
the town build grounds for its walking-horse shows, something
dear to the town's heart. There was just one hitch: Calsonic
set the dedication for Dec. 7 -- Pearl Harbor Day.
   Shelbyville veterans were outraged. "We beat the hell out
of the Japanese" in World War II, says Austin Shofner, a
Marine who was a Japanese prisoner of war for 11 months. "If
we had not, we'd be crawling on our bellies now." Mr.
Shofner, known around town as "the general," thought the
money shouldn't have been accepted.
   It was apparently Americans, not Japanese, who set the
date, and it was eventually changed. But by then, any good
will Calsonic had bought with its $2 million had evaporated.
   In the end, it will take more than good public relations
to assuage the concerns of Americans. To do that, Japanese
companies would have to begin acting more like their European
and American counterparts: More non-Japanese would have to be
given prominent positions in management and more non-Japanese
suppliers would have to be awarded business.
   Officials and experts in Japan say all this will
eventually happen, that Japanese companies simply need more
experience abroad. "This is just the first stage of
international investment," says Kenji Nagano, a senior staff
writer for the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the major business and
economic newspaper in Japan. "To survive, Japanese
multinationals will have to become more international."
   But Mr. Kreinin, the economist who studied Japanese
companies in Australia, has his doubts that the culprit is
mere inexperience. "I don't buy that argument," he says. "In
the case of Australia, there were some {Japanese} companies
that weren't all that new. Yet whenever they had expansion
possibilities, they went straight back to Japan" for managers
and suppliers.

   Flextronics Inc. said it expects to report a fiscal
fourth-quarter loss of $22 million on sales of about $41
million.
   Results for the quarter ended March 31 include costs
associated with the Fremont, Calif., company's recently
completed sale of a 55% stake in its Asian operations to an
investment group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year-earlier quarter, the disk-drive maker reported
a loss of $8.6 million on sales of $50.1 million.
   Flextronics said the asset sale will result in
"significant net profit" for the current quarter after
accounting for a onetime after-tax gain of about $13 million.
It didn't estimate the profit.

   Police vs. Labyrinth
   Of Search and Seizure

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A21

<LP>
   I appreciated the concerns expressed in your May 7
editorial "Crack, Murder and Miranda." As a police officer, I
have experienced firsthand the impact of the exclusionary
rule. Culpable defendants do indeed walk away laughing while
bewildered victims are left wondering why our courts are
known as part of the "justice system." I must disagree,
however, with your conclusion that law-enforcement officers
themselves should be victimized by "lawsuits, fines, pay cuts
and removal from the force" if they violate the labyrinthine
rules surrounding search and seizure.
   The body of law surrounding Fourth and Fifth Amendment
rights is voluminous and constantly evolving. The justices of
the Supreme Court rarely reach unanimity on any issue, and
many of the court's landmark search-and-seizure cases have
been decided by split votes of 5-4 or 6-3. Professional
police officers, however conscientious, find it difficult to
stay abreast of the latest decisions. If the most learned
jurists in our nation cannot agree what the law should be
after months of careful deliberation, can we expect a
policeman on a dark street at midnight to choose the right
course every time? Can we fine, sue or dismiss him if he
turns out to be wrong?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Police officers are sworn to protect the constitutional
rights of all people, including criminals. The vast majority
of officers would support sanctions against those few who
abuse their authority. They would also support a
simplification of the laws surrounding individual rights, so
that their decisions can be based on clear-cut precedents. If
an officer who errs in good faith is punished as the Journal
has suggested, the nation will quickly find itself without
anyone willing to fight in the front lines of the war on
drugs.

   First Boston Head
   Of Junk Bonds,
   Others Reassigned

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- First Boston Corp. replaced the head of its
junk-bond department and reassigned other executives amid a
deep slump in its bond financing business.
   The big securities firm named managing director William R.
Reid to head its junk-bond operations, succeeding David M.
Malcolm, who was reassigned to head the firm's real estate
group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Several other First Boston executives were also moved out
of the junk-bond group, which like most of Wall Street's
departments specializing in high-yield, high-risk bonds,
doesn't have much to do these days.
   Wesley Jones, a managing director, will move to the new
products group, according to people familiar with the firm.
Andrew Fisher, a vice president, is going to the
restructuring group. The moves are the latest signs of
turmoil at First Boston, which has been hit hard by the slump
in the $200 billion public junk-bond market.
   The firm hasn't led a junk-bond underwriting so far this
year. By contrast, in 1989's first half, it raised nearly
$1.4 billion through junk issues, generating $45 million in
fees, according to Securities Data Co. For all of 1989, First
Boston ranked No. 6 among junk-bond underwriters, with an 8%
market share. (Industrywide, Wall Street has raised just $1.1
billion from new junk-bond issues so far this year, a 93%
drop from the year-earlier period.)
   First Boston also has stumbled in refinancing some
temporary "bridge" loans it made to help corporate clients
finance takeovers. Earlier this year, the firm sold to CS
Holding more than half of a "hung" $450 million bridge loan
to Ohio Mattress Co. when First Boston couldn't easily sell
junk bonds in the market to refinance the loan.
   First Boston's parent, CS First Boston Inc., is
44.5%-owned by CS Holding, which owns the Swiss banking giant
Credit Suisse. First Boston earned just $11 million last
year.
   The executive shuffling comes amid a slump in First
Boston's overall bond-financing activities. This year through
Friday, the firm slumped to No. 5 from No. 2 in debt
underwriting, raising $12.4 billion through 61 issues for a
9.7% market share, according to Securities Data. Even with a
$1 billion financing deal yesterday, that's still a 16% drop
from the year-earlier level of $15.9 billion raised through
78 issues and a 12% market share.
   Mr. Malcolm, who joined First Boston in 1979 from Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co., declined through a spokesman to comment on his
new post. "It's premature to talk about anything," the
spokesman said. Mr. Malcolm, who will oversee the firm's
20-member real estate group, began his career at First Boston
by launching the firm's leasing operations. He was named
managing director in 1982 and has headed the junk-bond group
since December 1984.
   Mr. Malcolm, 43 years old, succeeds William Dickey, a
managing director, who will launch a new real estate division
in Los Angeles, the First Boston spokesman said. Mr. Dickey
will report to Mr. Malcolm; Mr. Malcolm will report to
Charles Murphy, co-head of investment banking.
   Mr. Reid, 34, who joined First Boston's junk-bond
department in 1985, was traveling and couldn't be reached for
comment. He joined the firm in 1980 from the Stanford
Graduate School of Business. After serving as an account
officer, he was named a director in 1987 and a managing
director in 1988.
   Messrs. Jones, Fisher and Dickey couldn't be reached.
   The recent moves aren't the only significant personnel
changes at First Boston lately. Earlier this month, the firm
lost David C. Batten, a managing director since 1978 who
played a major role in building First Boston's capital
markets business, to Blackstone Group.

   Oil Barge Runs

   A 465-foot barge carrying more than five million gallons
of heating oil ran aground near a Massachusetts tourist
haven, the second oil spill in that area in less than a week.
   Four of the barges's fuel tanks, with a total capacity of
1.2 million gallons, ruptured when the vessel foundered in
Buzzards Bay, Coast Guard officials said. But by late
yesterday only a minuscule amount of oil had leaked from the
vessel, they added. Because the damaged tanks were only
partly full, seawater, which is heavier than oil, rushed in
and forced the oil away from the ruptures, the officials
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There is no significant discharge yet," said Petty
Officer Elizabeth Brannan.
   Don Tuchman, an official with Mobil Corp., owner of the
oil cargo being carried by the barge, said: "Coast Guard
officials inform us they are optimistic that the oil spilled
can be easily cleaned up with no damage to beaches or sea
life."
   According to the Coast Guard, the barge's owner and
operator, Bouchard Transportation Co., has agreed to pay for
any cleanup. Within hours of the grounding cleanup contractor
Clean Harbor Inc. had put booms into the water downwind of
the barge. Other vessels were on their way to unload the oil.
   The Coast Guard said it doesn't yet know the cause of the
spill, but one official said poor visibility because of fog
appeared to play a major role.
   In the past two weeks, there have been two oil spills in
New York Harbor and a fire aboard a tanker spilled oil into
the Gulf of Mexico. Last week, the cruise ship Bermuda Star
ran aground in Buzzards Bay, only two miles from yesterday's
grounding, spilling about 7,500 gallons of residual fuel oil.

   BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Richard K. Donahue, a director, was
named president and chief operating officer of Nike Inc.,
assuming duties previously discharged by Philip H. Knight.
   The 52-year-old Mr. Knight remains chairman and chief
executive officer of the maker of athletic wear. He said he
will remain "as involved in Nike's operations" as he
currently is, while counting on Mr. Donahue to help manage
Nike's continuing growth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is not a change in Nike's management structure but a
supplement to it," Mr. Knight said. "We still have an
extremely strong core of officers who have brought the
company to where it is today. They will continue to do what
they have been doing, and so will I."
   Mr. Donahue, 62, is a trial lawyer and partner in Donahue
&amp; Donahue, a Lowell, Mass., law firm. He served as White
House congressional liaison in the Kennedy administration. A
Nike director since 1978, he has been credited with helping
direct the company's international expansion over the past
three years.
   Mr. Donahue's appointment marks the second time Mr. Knight
has decided to share some of his duties. In 1983, he
appointed Robert Woodell, a vice president of world-wide
marketing, to the posts of president and chief operating
officer. But Mr. Woodell relinquished the posts to Mr. Knight
a year later; the company, at the time, cited a clash of
management styles.
   Mr. Donahue, whatever else his talents, appears to have a
sense of humor. He is a father of 11 children and said he
couldn't turn down an opportunity to help run a company
associated with fitness and whose athletic shoes are promoted
by basketball superstar Michael Jordan.
   "I have worked everywhere from the White House down," Mr.
Donahue said, but "this is the only {job} that will actually
impress my kids."

   NWA Inc. Will Name Rentschler Today
   To Chief's Post, Industry Officials Say

<LP>
   NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, is expected to
name Frederick B. Rentschler as its new president and chief
executive officer today, industry officials said.
   Mr. Rentschler is currently president and chief executive
officer of Beatrice Co., the Chicago food company that
entered into a merger agreement with ConAgra Inc. two weeks
ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Rentschler, 50 years old, would succeed Frederic V.
Malek, a member of the investor group led by Alfred A.
Checchi that acquired NWA last year. Mr. Malek would stay on
as NWA's vice chairman.
   Mr. Rentschler's appointment means that the top three
management positions at NWA will be held by executives with
no previous airline experience. For seven months, the company
has been run by Mr. Checchi, Mr. Malek and Gary Wilson, all
former Marriott Corp. executives. Mr. Wilson's only other
airline experience was as an NWA director.
   Mr. Checchi has tapped other non-airline executives for
key roles. Only two of the five vice presidents he has hired
since become chairman last September have ever worked for an
airline.
   Mr. Checchi is said to have selected Mr. Rentschler
because of his strong consumer-marketing background.
Northwest is trying to shed a reputation for lackluster
service. The Checchi group has said its goal is to make
Northwest the airline of choice for business travelers, who
usually pay the highest fares.
   Toward that end, Northwest plans to spend $422 million
over the next five years improving its food, upgrading its
aircraft interiors and retraining its employees.
   Mr. Rentschler is credited with turning around the
Swift/Hunt-Wesson foods division of Esmark Inc. before
Beatrice acquired that company. He was forced out in a
management shake-up in 1984 after the Beatrice takeover. He
returned to Beatrice in 1986 after its acquisition by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the New York leveraged buy-out
firm.
   Mr. Rentschler's future was uncertain at Beatrice in light
of the merger with ConAgra, an Omaha, Neb., food concern.
However, officials familiar with the situation said Mr.
Rentschler's NWA appointment had been in the works for weeks.
   Mr. Rentschler couldn't be reached. NWA declined to
comment. Mr. Checchi is expected to announce Mr. Rentschler's
appointment today at a press conference in NWA's St. Paul,
Minn., headquarters.
   Whether Northwest suffers from its top management's lack
of airline expertise remains to be seen. A number of its vice
presidents and middle managers, including its operations and
marketing chiefs, have extensive airline experience.
   Although the Checchi team is getting high marks from the
NWA staff, some employees expressed concern about Mr. Malek's
outside activities. For the past several months, he split his
time between NWA and his duties as chief organizer of a
seven-nation economic summit planned for next month.
   Mr. Malek, a friend and adviser to President Bush, is
expected to play an increasing role in the Bush
administration. That factor led to his decision to step down
from day-to-day duties at Northwest, people familiar with the
decision said.
   Northwest, the result of a 1986 merger between Northwest
Orient Airlines and Republic Airlines, is the nation's fourth
largest carrier. It is the largest U.S. carrier to the North
Pacific, a region that produces about a third of its revenue.
It has spent the past three years expanding its European and
domestic routes as well.
   The Checchi group acquired NWA for $3.65 billion last
August. The airline had a first-quarter operating loss of
$89.8 million on revenue of $1.62 billion. It has forecast a
modest profit, its first since the takeover, for the second
quarter.
