   Dollar Is Mixed Amid Wild Rumors
   And Statements by Finance Officials

   NEW YORK -- The dollar was mixed yesterday as rumors of
war in the Persian Gulf competed for attention with policy
statements by monetary officals, leaving the market without
any clear direction.
   Toward the end of the New York session, the greenback was
higher against the yen and the Canadian dollar, but lower
against most continental European currencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 136.84
yen, up from 136.72 yen late Tuesday in New York. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 1.5650 marks, down from
1.5725 marks.
   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 137.65
yen, up from the 137.40 yen close there Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5660
marks, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5675 marks.
   Wednesday's thin trading session was described as
indecisive and frustrating, as most dealers tried to keep
their slates clean ahead of accounting for month-end and the
close of the Japanese first half, both on Sunday.
   Bank traders grumbled that the market fluttered every time
a finance official spoke at World Bank and International
Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. And they said dealings
were prey to rumormongers.
   The dollar had already lost ground to the yen late
yesterday after an unnamed German monetary official said the
yen should appreciate against the mark and Japanese Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said the yen should rise against
both the dollar and the mark.
   "You don't have to study economics, just wait for one of
them to speak," said Ty Tan, a New York dealer with Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank, of the officials.
   Yesterday, the dollar stabilized against the yen but fell
against the mark when Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
pledged to the IMF that the high costs of German unity won't
lead to "any concession as far as monetary stability is
concerned."
   Mark bonds already yield more than their U.S.
counterparts, attracting purchases of the German currency.
   Meanwhile, wild stories, all unfounded, began flying right
from the start of Tokyo trading. One asserted that Iraq had
bombed a Saudi pipeline, another that the Iraqi occupiers
were destroying Kuwait's oil infrastructure.
   The London and New York markets matched those rumors with
tales claiming that Egypt had invaded Iraq and that Iraq had
stormed U.S. embassies in Kuwait and Baghdad.
   Oil markets in Europe and the U.S. whispered that the U.S.
had shot down an Iraqi plane. Another story, told opposite
ways, said that Iraq had issued an ultimatum to the U.S. to
get out of Saudi Arabia or that the U.S. had issued Iraq an
ultimatum to leave Kuwait.
   "The market doesn't have its own idea of where the dollar
should be, so it waits for rumors or makes them up,"
commented Ralf Weidenhammer, manager of treasury and
foreign-exchange operations at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
   The rumors were given some credence yesterday because of
real fears of war. The United Nations Security Council voted
late Tuesday to impose an air embargo on Iraq. The decision
extends sea and land embargoes, but doesn't authorize UN
forces to shoot down planes violating the ban.
   Amid the gloom, the market proved unwilling to pick a
favorite currency and stick with it. With investors in a
bearish mood because of the drawn-out standoff in the Gulf
and high oil prices, all nations seem to have a cloud over
them.
   The Canadian dollar came under late pressure when Finance
Minister Michael Wilson told the Ottawa parliament that
domestic interest rates could continue their recent declines
"if there is a continuation of the easing of inflation and
the easing of economic conditions." Three-month Canadian
government bills currently yield about 12.5%.
   The Canadian currency was quoted in late New York trading
at 86.48 U.S. cents, down from 86.88 cents previously.
   The dollar ended European dealings mostly higher as the
threat of Persian Gulf hostilities bolstered the greenback.
   In Asian trading, the greenback ended mixed. The volatile
session saw wide swings in the yen and sterling. The U.S.
currency finished Wednesday in Tokyo at 136.84 yen, up from
136.72 yen late Tuesday.
   The dollar began lower on Mr. Hashimoto comment about
exchange rates but then rebounded when it failed to fall
below 136 yen.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $406.60 an ounce, up $4.20. Estimated
volume was a heavy six million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$407.25 an ounce.

   Your Sept. 20 editorial "A City Flounders" about my
mass-transit proposal does to facts what Cuisinart does to
onions, starting with the notion that I still chair the House
Budget Committee. I don't -- not since 1988.
   You think my provision is designed just to "support
Philadelphia's transit system." Actually, Pennsylvania has 38
transit authorities. All would benefit, which is why the idea
has drawn bipartisan support all around the state.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   You imply the provision is a response to Philadelphia's
fiscal woes. Wrong. For five years -- long before
Philadelphia's current crisis -- I've been urging
Pennsylvania and other states to establish a dedicated
funding source for mass transit. Every other state with a
major mass-transit system already has done so. That's why
Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner has called
dedicated state revenue an essential part of transit funding
-- and blasted Pennsylvania for lagging behind.
   Would my provision be a "pre-emption of state tax policy
by Congress?" Absolutely not. It purposely leaves the state
to decide how to come up with dedicated revenue. It doesn't
mandate a tax increase. Pennsylvania could make a multiyear
commitment from general revenue -- as New York has done -- or
use an existing fee such as vehicle registration.
   Actually, with dedicated revenue, transit authorities
would be much better off even if Pennsylvania didn't give
transit another nickel. They could then issue bonds against
what would be a guaranteed income stream and leverage their
funding resources up to 10 times. That's a move your readers
should understand -- even if it's too complicated for your
editorial writers.
   Finally, let's look at the wildest misstatement of all:
that this provision constitutes "blackmail . . . liberalism's
ultimate urban policy."
   What hypocrisy. Did you cry blackmail when Republicans
threatened to withhold federal funds to influence the
District of Columbia's abortion policy? What about the
provision in this same transportation spending bill that
withholds highway funds unless states suspend the licenses of
convicted drug offenders?
   I'm aware that editorials are opinion pieces -- but I wish
we could get back to the days when opinions were based on
fact.

   Movies:
   Hollywood Bans X in Movie Ratings

   NEW YORK -- The movie industry's ratings system, buckling
under an onslaught of internal criticism and charges that its
dreaded X rating smacks of censorship, will make major
changes in how it classifies films for their sexual and
violent content.
   The biggest change revealed yesterday by Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Association of America, is
the elimination of the X rating. It will be renamed NC-17,
meaning no children under age 17 will be admitted. In so
doing, Mr. Valenti seeks to do away with America's most
notorious scarlet letter, a seamy label that has come to be
associated with pornography.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The revised ratings system also will begin augmenting the
R rating, which requires children to be accompanied by a
parent or guardian, with brief descriptions specifying that a
film contains particularly graphic violence or explicit
sexuality. That change aims at parents who say the R category
has allowed a disturbing amount of violence to seep in and be
seen by kids in recent years.
   Mr. Valenti, who created the "voluntary" ratings system 22
years ago to enable the film industry to police itself and
avoid the creation of local censorship boards, had
steadfastly refused to overhaul it. But the system came under
heavy fire this year as 11 new films drew the X rating,
despite critical praise for their artistic content. Of 2,353
films rated in the previous five years, only seven ended up
with an X.
   Since the controversy erupted, a federal judge has
excoriated the system as "censorship from within," and said
it was "indefensible" to allow film makers to reap "huge
profits {by} pandering to the appetite for . . . hard
violence." Some 31 directors, including some of the most
famous names in Hollywood, have placed a full-page ad in
Variety saying "the taint of an X rating clearly results in
massive and arbitrary corporate censorship." Distributors
have even taken to criticizing the ratings process in their
ads on newspaper movie pages.
   When the system was first imposed, the X was seen merely
as an adult rating and it applied to such highly praised
works as "Clockwork Orange," "Last Tango in Paris" and the
Oscar-winning "Midnight Cowboy." But makers of blue movies,
who have never submitted their films to the ratings board,
quickly embraced the X. That is the fault of the Motion
Picture Association: the group trademarked the G, PG, PG-13,
and R ratings, but not the X.
   So the X came to mean unbridled, hardcore porn. Theaters
refused to show X fare. Newspapers and radio and television
stations barred ads for X films. The big studios avoided
releasing them.
   "The X became soiled by a lot of pictures that, to many
people, went beyond the pale," says Mr. Valenti. "Yes, I knew
it five years ago, but I didn't do anything about it."
   But it is far from clear whether Mr. Valenti's new system
will be successful. For one thing, it may open a new round of
fighting over whether tough films should get an R rating or
the new NC-17, now that the latter rating won't carry the
stigma of pornography. Studios may have a difficult time
persuading directors to edit their films to land an R rating
-- which would enable them to be shown to a broader audience
including teen-agers -- now that the shadow of the X will be
gone.
   Moreover, it's unclear how theaters, newspapers, radio and
television will react to the NC-17 rating once it takes hold.
Some might ban even that classification, since it is the
successor of X. "The real question is how will the exhibition
community react? If they start the same bans, it could be a
problem," says Thomas Rothman, senior vice president of
Samuel Goldwyn Co.
   But Mr. Valenti and his trade group had to do something.
The heat was turned up this year when Miramax Films Corp.
sued the Motion Picture Association over the X rating that
its review board had pasted on "Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down]" The
Spanish film by director Pedro Almodovar is the story of a
mental patient who abducts his favorite film star and ties
her up until she falls in love with him. The violence was far
more graphic in the R-rated "Total Recall," and the sex was
quite a bit steamier in the R-rated "Wild at Heart."
   Miramax lost its court bid, but not without a blistering
opinion on the ratings system from U.S. District Court Judge
Charles E. Ramos. Then the board issued an X for "Life Is
Cheap . . . but Toilet Paper is Expensive," a film directed
by Wayne Wang and distributed by a small company known as
Silverlight Entertainment. Silverlight's president, Mark
Lipsky, orchestrated the directors' full-page ad aimed at Mr.
Valenti and the association.
   The final straw occurred this month when, for the first
time this year, the ratings board issued an X to a major film
release from one of the Motion Picture Association's eight
members. "Henry and June," to be distributed by MCA Inc.'s
Universal studio, is the story of writer Henry Miller, his
wife and their common lover, a woman. Its infractions:
several scenes of lesbian love and one shot of a drawing of a
woman having an unnaturally affectionate relationship with an
octopus.
   Now, "Henry and June," instead of going through with an
appeal of the rating in the hopes of landing an R, will hit
theaters Oct. 5 as the first movie to carry the NC-17 rating.
The newly named category "is the right thing to do," says
Thomas Pollock, chairman of MCA's motion picture group. "I
had no choice before, because I was faced with an X, a
dishonorable rating."
   "My interest is in this film being able to be shown in
America uncut," rather than deleting scenes to get an R
rating, adds Philip Kaufman, the film's director. "It was a
good move on the part of Jack Valenti and the MPAA to make a
change. A little late? I suppose, but at least they did it."
   Russell Schwartz, executive vice president of Miramax,
said he is "very, very happy" with the renamed X. "I'm going
to send Jack Valenti some flowers, for a start." His
company's "Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down" and "The Cook, the Thief,
His Wife &amp; Her Lover" may end up getting the new rating. But
two other Miramax films -- last year's "Scandal" and the new
"Hardware," about a 21st Century robot that takes a severe
disliking to humans, already have been edited to get an R, in
essence falling to censorship, he concedes.
   The ratings changes, however, fall short of the solution
first demanded by Miramax and other critics, who had argued
that an entirely new category was needed. They called for an
A rating, for "adults only," that should fall between R and
the scandal-tinged X.
   Mr. Valenti refused to make that change. He is the single
most important force in the ratings tiff. He appoints the
ratings board's chairman and has a hand in approving its 10
members, who are parents who aren't employed in the movie
business. He also chairs the appeals board, consisting of a
dozen industry insiders, that sometimes overturns the ratings
board's decisions. And he is chairman of the policy review
committee that sets the rules that govern how the ratings
board functions. "I don't bow to pressure. The more pressure
I get, the less likely I am to respond," he says sternly.
   Lawyers had warned the Motion Picture Association that
setting up an A rating would force the ratings board to
decide the difference between artistic adults-only fare and
raunchy, pornographic releases. That would have left the
ratings system open to new legal challenges.
   The resulting NC-17 compromise has the support of the two
major entities that oversee the ratings, the eight-member
Motion Picture Association and the National Association of
Theater Owners. But Silverlight's Mr. Lipsky criticized the
plan, saying the NC-17 rating would allow a pornpeddler to
submit his film and get that classification rather than going
with an X.
   "It's a definite improvement," Mr. Lipsky says, "but it's
still a rating that opens its arms to `Debbie Does Dallas' at
the same time it helps `Life is Cheap' and `Tie Me Up]'"
   But Mr. Valenti dismisses such criticism. He says a
skin-flick distributor needs the X to represent "steamy,
erotic, the hottest thing since Adam and Eve." For that, he
adds, a rating of NC-17 just won't do.

              A Rash of Controversial Ratings
                                                                                                       

   From 1985 to 1989 the ratings board viewed more than 2,300
films and issued only 15 X ratings. But so far this year, 11
films have received an X, which usually hasn't been
overturned on appeal. Now the films may be given the new
rating of NC-17. Among them:

   BRUSSELS -- Shares of Rodamco N.V., a $4.5 billion
international property investment fund, sank 18% to 60
guilders ($33.86) on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
   A plunge in the stock price had been expected, in light of
a surprise announcement from the Rotterdam-based company
Monday that it was suspending its practice of purchasing its
own shares at book value. Trading in Rodamco was suspended
Monday and Tuesday, to give investors time to digest the
news. On Friday, Rodamco shares closed at 73.30 guilders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The policy change at Rodamco, one of the major funds in
the Robeco Group, means that it is no longer an open-end fund
-- one that issues new shares or redeems old ones in line
with market demand, keeping the price near the underlying
asset value. Shareholders who want to get out of the fund now
must accept the prevailing stock price.
   Rodamco said an outflow of funds this year, amounting to
more than 20% of the total, had forced it to suspend
repurchases in the interests of shareholders. Otherwise, it
would have had to borrow heavily or sell properties to pay
for redemptions.
   Robeco Group continues to repurchase shares in its Robeco
and Rolinco equity funds, as well as in its Rorento bond
fund. A spokesman said it was "very unlikely" that the
company would switch the policy for those funds.

   NCNB Will Post
   Much Lower Net;
   Loan Woes Cited

   NCNB Corp., struggling with weaker commercial real estate
markets in the Southeast, said it will increase its allowance
for loan losses and report sharply lower third-quarter
earnings.
   The Charlotte, N.C., bank holding company said it expects
to boost its allowance for loan losses by $65 million, to
about $590 million. With net loan charge-offs of about $75
million to $85 million, the provision for loan losses in the
third quarter should be about $145 million. That compares
with an $84 million provision in the second quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Including the weightier provision, third-quarter earnings
will plummet to $55 million to $65 million, or 50 cents to 60
cents a share, from the year-earlier $143.6 million, or $1.45
a share.
   Analysts were surprised by the size of the provision.
"People have been expecting some kind of softness, but the
magnitude has thrown them," said Henry Coffey, a bank analyst
at J.C. Bradford. Although NCNB will report earnings at about
half of what he projected, Mr. Coffey said that, amid a
difficult real estate environment, the company is "still
profitable, the dividend is safe, and the capital structure
is in good shape."
   The third-quarter earnings would be even worse, conceded
an NCNB spokesman, if not for the strong health of the
company's Texas operations.
   NCNB disclosed the news after the market closed. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
NCNB closed at $23.25, down $2.125.
   Several southeastern banks will be reporting lower
earnings in the third quarter, said Richard Stillinger, an
analyst at Keefe Bruyette. "The Southeast, by virtue of
having one of the stronger growth rates, is more vulnerable
to a pullback than, say, the Midwest."
   Hugh McColl, NCNB chairman, said the increased loan-loss
provision "reflects our awareness of weakening economic
conditions that have affected not only the real estate
markets, but lending activities in general."
   NCNB said its allowance for loan losses at Sept. 30 will
total $585 million to $600 million, or 1.6% to 1.65% of total
loans. That compares with an allowance of $525 million, or
1.46% of loans, at the end of the second quarter.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- News Corp.'s short-term borrowings
soared 34% in the year ended June 30 and Rupert Murdoch,
chief executive officer, has conceded that his international
media concern must trim the debt load.
   The annual report shows that interest-bearing debt jumped
to 10.53 billion Australian dollars (US$8.77 billion) in
fiscal 1990 from A$7.87 billion a year earlier. Short-term
debt (due within one year) soared to A$2.95 billion from
A$508.7 million. Longer-term borrowings rose to A$7.58
billion from A$7.36 billion. News Corp. also has A$1.41
billion in preference shares issued through units; including
these securities, debt totals A$11.94 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a speech to investors in New York on Monday, Mr.
Murdoch, who controls 45% of News Corp.'s shares, said the
company has "too much short-term debt" and is examining ways
to refinance the borrowings. Mainly, though, "We plan to get
our debt down with earnings from our assets" in the next few
years, he said.
   The company has been selling some assets in an effort to
damp the rise in debt. But it also is investing billions of
dollars in color printing presses for newspapers in Britain
and Australia, the Sky Television satellite-TV operation in
Britain, and the Fox Broadcasting Co. TV-programming service
in the U.S.

   NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence, which fell sharply in
August after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, remained at a
seven-year low in September.
   The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index
remained at 84.7 in September, the same level as the revised
August figure. The index had registered 101.7 in July. It was
in the 115-117 range in the first quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "With little or no progress in the Kuwait crisis, the
consumer's continued uncertainty is perhaps to be expected,"
said Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's
consumer research center. Mr. Linden added that consumers are
"increasingly concerned that inflation and interest rates
will be rising. Concerned consumers are cautious spenders."
   In the latest monthly survey conducted for the board by
National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, consumers
expressed slightly less confidence about current business
conditions and job availability. On the other hand,
expectations for six months ahead showed consumers expect
slightly better business conditions and employment prospects.
The survey uses 1985 as a base of 100 and covers 5,000
households throughout the U.S.
   The survey found 7.3% expect to buy an automobile within
six months, down from 7.5% in August; and 2.9% expect to buy
a home in the next six months, down from 3% last month.

   LONDON -- A team of West German and American scientists
has produced large quantities of a new form of carbon that
may occur naturally in space and could find important uses as
an industrial lubricant on earth.
   The new substance is dubbed "fullerite," after the late
architect and engineer R. Buckminster Fuller. Like his
geodesic domes, each molecule of the material is shaped like
a soccer ball.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Exact uses of the material won't be known for months, as
all its properties aren't yet known. But it's likely to join
a growing list of exotic, man-made materials finding uses in
engineering, aerospace and other fields.
   One possible application is as an industrial lubricant,
according to Alan Mackay, a crystallographer at London's
Birkbeck College, where Mr. Fuller once worked. In its
powdered graphite form, carbon is already used to reduce
grinding and wear in some high-precision machinery.
   The hollow ball-shaped molecules may also find uses in
chemistry, as submicroscopic capsules containing the
ingredients for chemical reactions.
   Very limited quantities of the unusual, 60-atom carbon
molecules were first produced in 1985 by researchers at the
University of Sussex. But the latest advance, reported in
today's issue of Nature, a British scientific journal, brings
the substance closer to commercial application.

   Calcium Slows Bone Loss for Women
   Past Menopause, Experiment Shows

   Women who are more than five years past menopause need to
take in at least 800 milligrams of calcium a day to keep
their bone loss at a minimum, an experiment with more than
300 women found.
   Researchers said that calcium-rich foods, such as dairy
products, were the best way to boost calcium consumption. But
the experiment also found that a patented form of calcium
that Procter &amp; Gamble Co. puts into its Citrus Hill Plus
Calcium orange and grapefruit juices might be a better source
of calcium supplement than calcium carbonate tablets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The experiment, reported in this week's New England
Journal of Medicine, was done by researchers at the
Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center
on Aging, located at Tufts University in Boston.
   The major portion of the $1 million-plus cost of the
experiment was borne by the Agriculture Department, said Bess
Dawson-Hughes, the nutrition scientist who headed the study.
But, Dr. Dawson-Hughes said, the scientists also sought and
received funding and supplies from Procter &amp; Gamble.
   Dr. Dawson-Hughes said the experiment was launched to find
out if increasing calcium intake would have any effect on the
loss of bone that women experience after menopause. This bone
loss can lead to osteoporosis, in which the weakened bones of
older women tend to fracture.
   The researchers recruited 361 women over age 50 from the
Boston area; half of the women regularly ate diets that
contained less than 400 milligrams of calcium a day, while
the other half regularly ate diets higher in calcium.
   The women were asked to take two white tablets a day while
continuing their regular diet. For a third of the women, the
tablets were placebos made of inert cellulose. For another
third the tablets were calcium carbonate, sometimes called
oyster shell calcium, which is the most common form of
calcium supplement. Among the dozens of brands of calcium
carbonate are Os-Cal from Marion Laboratories Inc., a unit of
Dow Chemical Co., and Caltrate from the Lederele division of
American Cyanamid Co.
   The remaining third of the women took tablets of calcium
citrate maleate, Procter &amp; Gamble's patented compound which
is available commercially only in the company's Citrus Hill
juices. The Procter &amp; Gamble product was included in the
experiment because earlier studies showed it is more readily
absorbed into the blood than calcium carbonate, Dr.
Dawson-Hughes said.
   The calcium supplements had little or no effect in many of
the women. Periodic measurements of the density of the spine,
forearm and hip bones, for example, showed that the bone loss
that occurs in the first five years after menopause wasn't
stemmed by the calcium supplements. Similarly, women who
regularly consumed more than 400 milligrams of calcium in
their daily diet showed little benefit of the calcium
tablets.
   But in women who were more than five years past menopause
and who were habitually eating a low-calcium diet, the
calcium tablets did slow the rate of bone loss, the
researchers said. Both types of calcium slowed the thinning
of the hip and forearm bones. But only the Procter &amp; Gamble
calcium slowed the loss of bone from the spine, they
reported.
   National nutrition surveys indicate that nearly half the
women in the U.S. consume less than 500 milligrams of calcium
daily compared with the recommended consumption of 800
milligrams.

"Our board of directors believes it is prudent and good
banking practice to conserve capital at this time in
recognition of the uncertain commercial real estate market
and associated risks that we, as well as other financial
institutions, are facing."
   In the first half, D&amp;N earned $2.8 million, or 76 cents a
share, up from $1.2 million, or 33 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   In other action at D&amp;N Financial's regular board meeting,
the corporation announced changes to the boards of the
corporation and its subsidiary, D&amp;N Savings Bank FSB. R.
Daniel Musser's recent resignation from the savings bank
board "due to other commitments" was accepted, and George

   NEW YORK -- As if rising oil prices weren't enough,
over-the-counter stocks had to fight a losing battle against
unsubstantiated rumors.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index gave up every bit and more of
Tuesday's 0.74% bounce as the price of oil rose more than $1
to surpass $39 a barrel on the November contract.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The index finished the day at 350.03, a loss of 4.75
points or 1.34%. The day was only slightly better at the New
York Stock Exchange where the Big Board composite index
dropped 1%.
   "We're a hostage to oil. Whatever oil does, we're doing
the opposite," says Steve Bliss, head of OTC trading at Mabon
Nugent &amp; Co.
   Barry Berman, head of equity trading at Robert W. Baird &amp;
Co, says trying to focus past so many negatives -- Iraq, the
federal budget, tight credit, economic weakness, inflation --
has given investors too many reason not to buy.
   "There is an absolute paralysis on the part of an awful
lot of portfolio managers who have been shellacked recently,"
says Jonathan Raclin, executive vice president for equity
sales, trading and research at Chicago Corp.
   Adding to the real worries yesterday were a series of
rumors that all proved untrue. Traders reported the market
was hurt by talk of: a coup in the Soviet Union; an ultimatum
from President Bush for Iraq to evacuate Kuwait; air battles
in the Middle East; and the storming of the U.S. embassy in
Kuwait. None of the rumors was substantiated.
   There were 1,255 declining OTC issues and just 654
advancers. Volume increased to 118.7 million shares from
Tuesday's 109.9 million shares.
   Already skittish, investors didn't tolerate any hint of
disappointing earnings, and Oracle Systems disappointed
investors for the second time in two weeks.
   The software maker began its downward spiral when it told
investors two weeks ago that earnings wouldn't meet prior
projections. When the market closed Tuesday, Oracle reported
that fiscal first quarter earnings were even lower than it
projected Sept. 7. The firm reported a net loss of 27 cents a
share, below the 20-cents-a-share loss it predicted two weeks
ago. A year ago, Oracle had net income of nine cents a share.
It was the day's most active issue, losing 1 1/8 to 6 1/4, a
18% drop to a new 52-week low.
   Selling abounded in just about every OTC sector. Banks,
insurance companies and other interest-rate sensitive stocks
sustained losses.
   Home Savings Bank's merger with H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. is
tied to the price of H.F. Ahmanson stock. Both companies said
the merger agreement is secure. But as H.F. Ahmanson shares
slid 1 1/8 to 13 1/8 on the Big Board, Home Savings Bank fell
2 1/4 to 12 1/2.
   There were plenty more losses in the banking sector.
Ameritrust was 1 1/4 lower to 11 7/8. CoreStates Financial
lost 1 3/8 to 26 1/2. Midlantic was off 1 to 7 7/8. Michigan
National closed at 22 3/4, down 1 1/4.
   Among insurance stocks, Cincinnati Financial continued to
fall off its peak. After holding its gains longer than most
in recent weeks, Cincinnati Financial shares have been
falling as investors take profits and amid concerns about the
value of its equity portfolio. Its shares closed 4 7/8 lower
at 73 1/4.
   Ohio Casualty shares fell 3 to 31. Provident Life eased
3/8 to 17 1/2. Safeco was down 3/8 to 27 7/8. St. Paul Cos.
slid 3/4 to 51.
   Kinetic Concepts dropped 5/8 to 2 1/2 after revealing it
will lay off 10% of its 1,500 workers and charge $6 million
to $7 million against third quarter earnings. With the seven
cents to eight cents a share charge, Kinetic Concepts
projects third quarter net income of two cents to three cents
a share, down from 12 cents a share a year ago.
   Meridian Bancorp shares fell 1 1/2 to 11 3/4 on its
announcement that it anticipates a net loss for the third
quarter between 86 cents and 96 cents a share, fully diluted.
Meridian said its dividend is secure. It blamed the loss on
increased reserves for possible loan losses and a charge for
the planned sale of its title insurance operations. In the
year-ago quarter, Meridian earned 56 cents a share, fully
diluted.
   A delay in Collagen's plans to spin off its Celltrix unit
will cut its first months profit in half, the company said
late Tuesday. Collagen indicated its first six months net
income is likely to be between 10 cents and 12 cents a share,
down from 23 cents a share in the period a year ago. The
biomedical company's shares dropped 2 to 16 7/8.
   Ashton-Tate said its board has authorized the repurchase
of up to one million of its 25.3 million common shares
outstanding. Ashton-Tate finished unchanged at 6 1/4.

   Midwest Shakes, Rattles, Rolls,
   But May Really Boogie on Dec. 3

   A scientist predicts that a major earthquake will strike
the Midwest in early December. Yesterday, the area was
rattled by its biggest quake in 14 years.
   Coincidence? Read on.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At 8:19 a.m. CDT yesterday, a moderate earthquake shook
parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri and
Tennessee. The quake, which measured about 4.7 on the Richter
scale, broke windowpanes, cracked plaster, and toppled a
chimney in southern Illinois.
   The quake was centered on the New Madrid fault, a 120-mile
jagged formation that runs from Illinois to Arkansas. In the
early 1800s, the area had some of the worst quakes ever on
this continent. Still active today, the New Madrid fault has
150 small earthquakes a year.
   But what rattled nerves more than usual yesterday is
what's known as "The Prediction," which for several months
has been the talk of cities and towns all along the
Mississippi Valley. Iben Browning, a New Mexico scientist and
business consultant, has said strong tidal forces around Dec.
3 will produce a greater-than-normal chance that the New
Madrid area will have at least a magnitude 7.0 quake -- about
as big as the one that devastated California's Bay Area last
October.
   Don't laugh: Mr. Browning predicted the Bay Area quake one
week before it happened, say people who heard him speak at
the time.
   The Dec. 3 forecast, which has been dismissed as absurd by
the country's top seismic experts, has nonetheless spurred
thousands of people to cram into earthquake-survival
seminars. Some schools and businesses plan to close in early
December.
   Was yesterday's quake a foreshock for the Big One?
"There's no way a seismologist can know," says Arch Johnston,
an earthquake expert at Memphis State University, which had
three secretaries tied up all yesterday morning answering
calls from media and concerned Memphians. Adds Gerald
Wierczorek, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey, "We
don't think there is necessarily any correlation with the
prediction." Mr. Browning couldn't be reached.
   The quake certainly didn't help already jittery nerves. In
St. Louis, a TV business reporter aired a special segment
yesterday on buying earthquake insurance. In New Madrid, Mo.,
the fault's namesake, a spokesman for the school district
says plans under consideration to close in early December are
all but locked up now.

   TULSA, Okla. -- T/SF Communications Corp. said it expects
to report a slight loss for 1990, based on losses in the
first six months and expectations that net income for the
second half will be the same as or only slightly better than
a year earlier.
   The communications company reported losses of $436,000 on
revenue of $22.6 million for the first six months of this
year. For all of 1989, the company reported net income of
$325,000 on revenue of $74.3 million.

   Separately, the company said its board authorized the
repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of its common stock in a
"Dutch auction." Under the plan, shareholders could offer to
sell their stock back to the company at a price specified by
the tendering shareholder, subject to the company's agreement
to the offered price.
   The company said its projections contradict those of some
analysts who had forecast better earnings for the second half
of this year.
   In a statement, Chairman G. Douglas Fox attributed the
expected results to continuing problems in the commercial
printing division of the company's shopper-newspaper
operation in New Jersey.
   "Continued softening of the economy in the Northeast is
contributing to our current problems in New Jersey and New
York," Mr. Fox said. "Our daily newspaper, information
services and trade journal divisions are doing well and will
likely complete the year with substantial improvement from
1989."

   New Operation
   To Repair Wrist
   Speeds Recovery

   For the thousands of people who suffer from the wrist
ailment known as carpal tunnel syndrome, resorting to surgery
often means more than a month off the job. But surgeons are
pioneering techniques to get patients back to work sooner.
   Carpal tunnel syndrome, a weakness and pain in the wrist
often linked to repetitive motion, has become one of the most
commonly recognized injuries of the workplace. And the
operation, a last recourse following the failure of other
therapy, has become an important part of the surgical
repertoire, though estimates of the number of operations
performed in the U.S. range widely. Some surgeons place the
annual number between 50,000 and 100,000.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the new techniques, which use fiberoptics and
video cameras, still provoke skepticism within the surgical
profession, they are sure to attract keen attention from
patients and their employers.
   At a surgeons' conference this week in Toronto, John M.
Agee presented the results of a carefully controlled study of
the new approach. Ninety-seven patients needing surgery on
one wrist were randomly assigned to surgeons using new or
traditional techniques at 10 medical centers. The result:
After the traditional surgery, the median return-to-work time
was 46.5 days; after the new way, only 25 days.
   For the group that underwent the new surgery, gripping and
pinching strength returned sooner. And according to patients'
subjective reports, pain and tenderness due to surgery eased
faster with the new approach.
   "The issue for society and for my patients is: When can
they go back to work and feed the family?" says Dr. Agee of
Sacramento, Calif., who has been in the forefront of testing
the high-tech methods.
   The issue isn't always that stark, because many people are
cushioned by workman's compensation or sick-time arrangements
with their employers. But there are other concerns, too, such
as how soon people can use their hands for such simple
functions as dressing and driving.
   Dr. Agee's report follows one earlier this year by James
C.Y. Chow, who has been developing his own new technique
using somewhat different methods. Dr. Chow, a professor at
Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in
Springfield, says that in his first 149 cases, 29% of the
patients returned to work within a week and 59% within two
weeks.
   Already manufacturers are teaming up with the doctors.
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. has sold about 100
equipment packages derived from the work of a California
research laboratory directed by Dr. Agee. Smith &amp; Nephew
Dyonics Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Smith &amp; Nephew PLC,
London, plans to market a package based on Dr. Chow's work
early next year.
   Yet many doctors caution that questions of effectiveness,
cost and safety remain. "As to whether it's a major advance,
the jury is still out," says Ronald L. Linscheid, president
of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.
   Recently, carpal tunnel syndrome has received intense
scrutiny as a work-related ailment, though it can also result
from pregnancy and diseases including arthritis. It is often
associated with jobs requiring repetitive motion, whether
along an assembly line or at a computer terminal.
   In August, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration issued guidelines to the meat-packing
industry meant to prevent such injuries, the first step in a
program OSHA plans to extend to other industries.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which extrapolates the
incidence of work-related injuries from employers' reports,
recorded 115,000 repetitive motion, or "repeated trauma,"
injuries for 1988. That was 48% of all recorded injuries, a
proportion that had grown steadily through the decade from
18% in 1981.
   The number of people who suffer from carpal tunnel
syndrome remains a mystery because the repeated trauma
category includes other injuries, such as noise-caused
deafness. But no one doubts that awareness of the syndrome,
which can lead people to seek medical treatment more quickly,
is rising.
   "It's just exploding," says Roger Stephens, an OSHA
specialist in ergonomics, or the science of adapting the
workplace to the worker.
   The carpal tunnel is a tiny channel within the wrist
through which tendons and a nerve, called the median nerve,
pass into the hand. If membranes around the tendons thicken,
pressure can build on the nerve and its blood supply, causing
pain and numbness and loss of strength in the hand. These
symptoms can often be allayed by stopping the activity that
aggravates them, by splinting the wrist or by taking
anti-inflammatory drugs.
   Still, a lot of people turn to surgery. The framework of
the carpal tunnel, though mostly bone, includes a section of
ligament. Severing it relieves the pressure.
   Traditionally, surgeons have made an incision across the
wrist and up the hand, one inch to three inches in length.
That exposes the ligament to plain view. By contrast, Drs.
Agee and Chow first insert into the wrist a tube known as an
endoscope, fitted with a lens and fiberoptic apparatus, and
then their cutting instruments. They find the ligament and
watch the movement of the instruments on a TV monitor. Dr.
Agee uses one small incision; Dr. Chow, two. In both
approaches the goal is to minimize damage to other tissues.
   Still, surgeons may hesitate to switch from the
traditional technique. Some want more evidence that the rate
of recurring symptoms isn't unusually high. Another issue is
cost, though surgeons and hospitals shouldn't have to raise
their bills sharply just to cover equipment purchases. 3M is
selling its package for $6,000, and only the blade, a $160
item, is disposable.
   The most sensitive issue may be the risk of using an
endoscope. Dr. Agee himself emphasizes the need for training
to prevent nicking of nerves and arteries, though he notes
that even the traditional technique hasn't been free of
accidents. A spokeswoman says 3M won't sell its equipment to
doctors unless they take a half-day course, including work on
cadavers.
   A. Lee Osterman, a hand surgeon at the University of
Pennsylvania, has tried both the Agee and Chow techiques. For
now, he is withholding judgment. But he says of the new way,
"I think patients are going to push us to use it, as long as
it isn't unacceptably dangerous."

   U.S. Says Students
   Often Lack Skills
   For College or Jobs

   WASHINGTON -- Fewer than 10% of the nation's high school
seniors have the skills necessary to perform demanding jobs
or do college work, according to an analysis of national test
results.
   A comparison of results on tests given to students in the
fourth, eighth and 12th grades shows that schools are doing a
worse job today of teaching so-called higher order skills in
reading, mathematics and science than they were 20 years ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For instance, the analysis said, on the latest tests given
by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which
measures what school children know, only 5% of high school
seniors could "synthesize and learn from specialized reading
materials." Only 6% can solve multistep math problems and use
basic algebra, and 8% showed on science tests that they can
"draw conclusions using detailed knowledge." In history, only
5% showed that they know and "can interpret relatively
detailed information and ideas."
   "These are skills we usually associate with the ability to
function in demanding jobs in the workplace or the capability
to do college work," said Emerson Elliot, the acting U.S.
commissioner of education statistics. A recent survey
reported that 75% of college faculty members believe that
students entering college lack basic skills.
   The new report, called "America's Challenge: Accelerating
Academic Achievement," is a collection of earlier test
results. Education Department officials said they issued the
report to help call attention to the nation's poor school
performance. Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos called the
report "a compendium of disappointment." Noting that the
report is being released a year after President Bush and the
nation's governors held an "education summit" that produced
an ambitious set of goals for the year 2000, Mr. Cavazos
said, "This report indicates that we have a long way to go."
   Officials noted that the causes of the problems aren't
new: too much TV and too little homework, too much passivity
in the classroom and too little parental interest in how the
children do in school. The survey said that 56% of U.S. high
school seniors read a total of 10 pages or less each day for
all their course work.
   The survey of 20 years of test results does contain some
good news that reflects the "back-to-basics movement" of the
past decade. More students are mastering fundamental skills
such as basic math problems with whole numbers, and the gap
between white students and black and Hispanic students is
narrowing. But "very few students demonstrated that they can
use their minds well," the report said. Many students avoid
or can't find challenging courses in science and other
subjects, the report said.
   Chester Finn, chairman of the panel that runs the national
assessment, said low college entrance requirements are partly
to blame. "If colleges don't require chemistry, kids won't
take chemistry," he said.

   Your Sept. 4 editorial "Salmon Survive Oil Spill" cites
this year's strong return of pink salmon to Prince William
Sound, Alaska, as conclusive evidence that last year's
massive oil spill by the tanker Exxon Valdez had little
impact on the area's salmon. Unfortunately, editorial writers
often reach conclusions that scientists wouldn't touch with a
10-foot pole.
   While the pink-salmon return is encouraging, the
scientists we talked to warned against drawing any
conclusions until more information is gathered. Those
scientists argued that we must first understand what role the
various parts of Prince William Sound's complex ecosystem
might have played in producing the large return.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For example, as televised news reports repeatedly showed,
the heavy crude oil killed vast numbers of sea birds and
marine mammals. It is these same populations of birds and
mammals that prey on salmon fry and smolts. Remove the
predators from the food chain and the prey flourish. Clearly,
if a greater number of juvenile salmon survive to adulthood,
then there are more adults to return to their spawning rivers
and streams.
   Your editorial appropriately argues against "the politics
of hysteria." Even more destructive, however, are public
apathy and misplaced confidence that could result from
simplistic -- and perhaps incorrect -- conclusions.

   You were factually so far off that I wonder what you were
thinking about. Salmon hatch way upriver, which was probably
not in water reached by the Exxon oil spill. And most salmon
stay out for more than a summer or even a year. Most of them
caught this year should have been out in the ocean when the
spill occurred. Although it is interesting that a large
number came back through the spill area after a good deal of
cleanup, the effect of the spill itself may not be gauged for
a few years, when the real Exxon salmon come back.
Nonetheless, your last paragraph was pretty much on the mark
-- as regards zero-risk environmentalists.
   Malcolm Landis
   Upland, Calif.
   ---
   Your editorial will cause your "credibility among informed
people," to borrow your phrase, to suffer a setback.
   The effect of last year's spill on the salmon population
will be most apparent in spring 1993, when the first of the
young fish subjected to the toxic environment should be
returning from their ocean sojourn. An uncertainty is
introduced here by the differing times certain salmon remain
in fresh water before transitioning to salt, so the effect
may show up sooner because the four-year cycle is roughly
common in all Pacific salmon. The question remains as to the
subsequent years' populations, and the long-term effect the
spill will have on young salmon making their way to the
ocean. Your article serves only to confirm the long-held
notion that maturing salmon, some of which are the four-year
fish making up the record 1990 harvest, spend the greater
part of their lives in the deep ocean, not in Prince William
Sound.
   The damage done by the spill may not be irreversible, but
as an ardent salmon fisherman I have seen the results of
devastating practices on salmon populations, and I know how
long and difficult it can be to restore them. The
environmentalists are right in being upset.

   Before you start crowing too loudly, you may wish to
consider the following: When drought or other high-stress
situations threaten the well-being of a pine tree, it
marshals all of its remaining energy to set a massive crop of
seed. This way, the endangered tree increases the odds that
at least its progeny will survive.
   Nature is rife with similar examples. They are not the
acts of healthy species, but of endangered ones.

   Gregory Peck (Letters, Sept. 12) tries to defend himself
against Paul A. Gigot's charge that People for the American
Way "paid Gregory Peck to smear Judge Bork." Not so, cries
the offended Mr. Peck. "It is not true that I was paid."
Well, half a defense is better than none, I suppose, and I
for one am quite willing to believe him.
   Indeed, Mr. Peck has been a tireless supporter of
left-wing causes for, by his own account, "more than 40
years." He has been among the most reliable of Hollywood's
corps of trained seals, ever ready to spout whatever, from
time to time, the left needs to have spouted. And so he was
in Judge Bork's case: His charges of racial intolerance,
solemnly intoned in that golden voice, were defamatory and
false -- a smear by any definition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Worse, his explanation of why he did it -- what flaws in
Judge Bork's makeup justified his assault? -- bears a
disquieting resemblance to the intemperate mouthings of Teddy
Kennedy, kicking off the smear-Bork campaign.
   Moreover, the moral sensibilities that Mr. Peck found
lacking in Judge Bork are precisely the kind of thing that
can have no proper part in judging, as David Souter recently
informed Sen. Kennedy and his colleagues on the Judiciary
Committee.
   So Mr. Peck adds ignorance to arrogance, which should
(but, regrettably, probably won't) detract from his
credibility the next time Norman Lear, or some other
puppeteer, calls upon him.

   I join Tim W. Ferguson in applauding Walter Minnick's
argument that our nation's efforts to achieve environmental
goals should be built on sound economic policy ("Business
World," Sept. 18). Economists know that protectionism
promotes inefficiency and waste. Environmentalists should
heed Mr. Minnick's warning that a domestic timber industry
propped up by trade restrictions and other government
subsidies won't "save" old forests -- or new forests -- for
long.
   Unfortunately, Mr. Ferguson has reported one very
important statistic incorrectly. U.S. forestry companies do
not rely on public lands for the bulk of their timber supply.
According to the Agriculture Department, the national forests
now account for 13%, and all other federal and state lands
account for 7%, of the annual wood harvested in the U.S.
Nevertheless, each year up to one-half of Forest Service
timber placed on the market is sold at prices that do not
recover the government's costs of growing and selling the
trees. In 1989, such below-cost timber sales cost federal
taxpayers at least $365 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This strange outcome reflects the fact that Forest Service
managers are rewarded for gross timber receipts, acres logged
and local jobs "created," not for habitat protected or
taxpayer dollars saved. Until these perverse incentives are
changed, the Forest Service will continue destroying the
environment and undercutting investments in private-sector
forestry.

   Defense in Museum Obscenity Case
   Faces Hard Task of Picking Jurors

   Defense lawyers in the first obscenity trial against a
U.S. museum may have a tough time picking a favorable jury
despite using state-of-the-art jury selection research.
   Based on some of the answers they got in three days of
questioning prospective jurors, the defense team faces an
uphill fight in the trial, expected to begin today or
tomorrow in Cincinnati municipal court.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director are
charged with criminal obscenity and displaying illegal images
of nude children. At issue are seven of 175 photographs
included in an exhibition by the late Robert Mapplethorpe
that was on display here from April 7 through May 26. If
convicted, the museum would face up to $10,000 in fines and
its director, Dennis Barrie, would face up to a year in jail
and a $2,000 fine.
   The case hinges on whether the jury finds, as prosecutors
contend, that five of Mr. Mapplethorpe's photographs,
depicting sadomasochistic and homoerotic images, are obscene
and whether two others, depicting nude children, violate
child pornography laws. As in any trial, the outcome will
largely depend on the jurors selected, but the choices will
weigh especially heavily in this case.
   The law defining obscenity rests on a three-pronged test
that can vary from community to community. Jurors will be
asked whether the average person, applying contemporary
community standards, would find that the work as a whole
appeals to prurient interests, and whether the work depicts
sexual practices in a patently offensive way. Even if the
jury finds those propositions to be true, it can convict only
if it also finds that the work, taken as a whole, lacks
serious literary or artistic value.
   H. Louis Sirkin, representing Mr. Barrie, has said he
generally wants jurors who feel at ease with themselves and
can be open-minded. Mr. Sirkin and his partner, Marc D.
Mezibov, said they hired a consultant to conduct a community
poll to help pinpoint which residents of Cincinnati and
surrounding Hamilton County would look upon Mr.
Mapplethorpe's work most openly. They declined to give any
details of what they found.
   Community polling, often complemented by pretrial mock
trials and the use of psychologists to help evaluate
prospective jurors, has become a widely accepted means of
helping lawyers in jury selection.
   Defense lawyers for Mr. Barrie and the arts center gave a
hint of what their survey found Monday when they asked
Hamilton County Municipal Judge David F. Albanese to limit
the trial's pool of prospective jurors to residents of
Cincinnati, arguing that rural and suburban Hamilton County
residents are too strongly predisposed against pornography to
serve as objective jurors. Judge Albanese, a former assistant
prosecutor for Hamilton County who is up for re-election in
1993, denied the motion.
   Finding jurors sympathetic to protecting homoerotic art
was likely to be difficult even if limited to city residents,
however. Works previously perceived by Cincinnati
law-enforcement officials as pornographic have included
"Hair," "Oh] Calcutta" and "Equus." When the Martin Scorcese
film "The Last Temptation of Christ" was released, theater
owners here skirted the controversy surrounding the film by
simply not showing it. There are no adult book and video
stores in Cincinnati and no nude dancing or X-rated cable
video programing.
   For the past three days, defense lawyers for Mr. Barrie
and the museum and Hamilton County chief prosecutor Frank
Prouty have been probing the backgrounds and values of
prospective jurors in an effort to select eight from a pool
of 50. The lawyers have been asking pointed and personal
questions about prospective jurors' attitudes toward
homosexuality, their interest in art, their receptivity to
ideas and forms of expression they may find offensive and the
extent to which they have stayed abreast of contemporary
events.
   Only three of the 50 prospective jurors had been to the
Mapplethorpe exhibit, and none was seated for the trial. Most
who were questioned had never heard of Mr. Mapplethorpe; few
said they visited galleries. One prospective juror said he
had been to only two movies in three years and wouldn't have
recognized the Center for Contemporary Art if he had driven
by it. A movie that would interest him, he said, "would be a
movie that showed true love, two people truly caring for each
other."
   Another said he preferred working, fishing and treasure
salvaging to anything else. "If somebody invited me to a
museum or something, I might go, but who's going to invite
me?" he said.
   The judge in the case has asked members of the press not
to name the jurors to shield them from harassment or
embarrassment.
   An earlier ruling by Judge Albanese could add
significantly to the challenge facing the defense. The judge
said the jury will not necessarily have to view the exhibit
as a whole in determining whether the individual pictures
named in the indictment are obscene. The ruling effectively
means that the art center and Mr. Barrie could be convicted
if the jury finds any one of Mr. Mapplethorpe's photos
obscene.
   The judge, however, is still expected to hear more expert
testimony that the entire Mapplethorpe retrospective should
be considered as a whole.

   CREDITORS COMMITTEES lose appeal over reimbursement for
expenses.
   The federal appeals court in Cincinnati became the first
such court in the nation to address the issue of whether
members of creditor committees in bankruptcies are entitled
to compensation for their expenses.
   The decision barring expense payments to creditor groups
is expected to hamper the participation of small creditors in
bankruptcy-law proceedings, lawyers said.
   The case involves George Worthington Co., a Mentor, Ohio,
hardware goods distributor that filed a voluntary petition
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code in 1986. The company, now called Worthington Group,
emerged from bankruptcy protection in 1988.
   The bankruptcy court appointed 12 members to a committee
of creditors that represented unsecured claims against
Worthington of over $13 million. The committee submitted
requests for reimbursement of expenses totaling $16,727. The
debtor did not object to the request.
   But in a 2-1 decision, the appeals panel upheld a lower
court decision denying the committee's request. The appeals
panel wrote that Congress had the ability to grant the
bankruptcy courts' authority to allow for reimbursement but
had failed to do so. If creditors fail to participate in
committees because they cannot recoup their expenses, the
court wrote, "then the remedy should be supplied by Congress,
not the court."
   A majority of courts have allowed reimbursement for
members' expenses out of the debtor's estate. But bankruptcy
lawyers say the uncertainty arises out of a change in the
bankruptcy act in 1978. Prior to that time, the rules allowed
for the recovery of administrative expenses. But the current
bankruptcy rules do not contain an express right to such
reimbursement by members of creditor committees.
   "The creditors in very large bankruptcies usually have
sufficient economic interest to absorb the expenses of
economic participation. But the decision means that creditors
with small claims won't be represented, even though the
number of claims may in the aggregate be quite large," says
Dennis O'Dea, a lawyer with the Chicago law firm Keck, Mahin
&amp; Cate and counsel to the Worthington creditors committee.
Mr. O'Dea said he plans to ask the court to rehear the case.
   But lawyers representing creditors say the case will have
repercussions in large bankruptcy cases as well. "In a large
and complex case, there are substantial expenses over an
extended period of time. Often members have to fly in from
various states around the country," says Ellen Werther, a
lawyer with the New York law firm Coudert Brothers who is
representing a committee of bondholders of Allied Stores
Corp. in the Allied and Federated Department Stores
bankruptcy cases pending in Cincinnati.
   Ms. Werther said the implications of the Worthington case
are expected to be discussed today at a hearing in the case.
The bankruptcy court hasn't determined whether it will
approve expenses for members of the creditor committees,
which are expected to run "in the tens of thousands of
dollars," according to Jonathan M. Jacobson, a Coudert
lawyer.

   SONY LOSES bid to halt fraud suit stemming from takeover
of Columbia.
   A federal judge in Manhattan rejected Sony Corp.'s motion
to dismiss a class-action lawsuit filed by former
shareholders of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. Sony
agreed to buy Columbia for $3.4 billion in September 1989.
   The shareholders allege that Sony violated securities laws
in the months before the takeover by making false and
misleading statements denying that merger negotiations were
under way. The shareholders claim that the denials, issued
through news releases to the media, artificially depressed
Columbia's stock price, causing the shareholders to sell
their stock at a loss.
   In federal court in Manhattan, Judge Leonard Sand ruled
that the allegations in the lawsuit were sufficient to allow
the case to continue.
   Sony had claimed that the plaintiffs hadn't shown that the
news releases were false and that the denials didn't have a
significant impact on the stock price. But Judge Sand ruled
that disclosure of any takeover negotiations might have
changed the way investors viewed the stock. Attorneys for
Sony couldn't be reached for comment.

   PETER TUFO leaves Brown &amp; Wood to join Lazard Freres &amp; Co.
   Mr. Tufo, who helped build Tufo &amp; Zuccotti into one of New
York City's most politically powerful law firms in the 1980s,
will become a senior adviser at the investment banking firm
Lazard Freres.
   The move follows by three years a merger of Tufo &amp;
Zuccotti into the law firm of Brown &amp; Wood. Last year, Mr.
Tufo's former partner, John Zuccotti, also made a career
change when he joined the real estate conglomerate Olympia &amp;
York USA as president.
   A Lazard spokesman said Mr. Tufo would be used as a
resource for the firm's legal, real estate and bankruptcy
work. In addition to his legal work, Mr. Tufo currently
serves as chairman of the New York State Thruway Authority.

   With that, Mr. Achkar ducks into the shade, eluding
further queries about politics.
   Labyrinthine logic comes naturally in this city of cramped
alleys and whispered thoughts. But rarely have Syria's
contortionist skills been tested so severely. By lining up
against arch-rival Saddam Hussein, President Hafez Assad has
put Syria in the same tent as old and bitter foes, the U.S.
and its moderate Arab allies. He has pitted Damascus against
a neighbor that espouses three pillars of Syrian ideology:
Arab unity, shared Arab wealth and the Palestinian cause. And
he has sent troops to the front of a potential war in which
most Syrians would rather be in the opposing trench.
   "For years, Assad has been the odd man out in the Arab
world," says a European ambassador in Damascus. "Now, he's
the odd man in."
   Syrians sympathetic to Iraq remain, for now, a very silent
majority. One reason is that Mr. Assad's iron-fisted regime
tolerates little dissent, and has put it down brutally in the
past.
   Another reason is that Mr. Assad still is hard-line on the
one issue that really counts to most Syrians. Asked about the
"current Mideast crisis," a restaurant cook named Kasim
Hasoun instinctively responds by talking about the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, not the Persian Gulf. "If the
Zionists don't leave our land, we will have another war, for
sure," he shouts, angrily mashing chick peas.
   Reminded that war soon may break out on Syria's other
flank, Mr. Hasoun shrugs. The Gulf conflict "is a side show,"
he says.
   Syrians' tunnel vision, and their broad support for Iraq,
bode poorly for Mr. Assad's flirtation with the U.S. and
moderate Arab states. If Syrian troops join battle against
Iraq, the now-muted anger with Mr. Assad could flare into
violence. If Israel is drawn into the Gulf conflict, Syria
almost certainly will switch sides. And if the U.S. shows no
signs of pressuring Israel to negotiate over the occupied
lands, Syrians' demonized image of America will quickly
re-emerge.
   At his home in a shady quarter of Damascus, Defense
Minister Mustafa Tlas serves up hot tea and frosty views of
Syria's odd bedfellowship with the U.S. in the Gulf.
"American troops don't know why they are in the desert," he
says. The only reason he sees is that "the U.S. seeks
supremacy in the world." Syrian troops, by contrast, are
"doing a holy job" by defending Saudi Arabia.
   To Gen. Tlas, as to many Syrians, the U.S. is "the great
engineer," set to tighten the screws on Israel as soon as the
Gulf conflict ends. If Israeli-held territory isn't liberated
through diplomacy, "we will take it," he says.
   Nor have Syrians softened their views on terrorism, the
main obstacle to closer ties with the U.S. The mere mention
of Ahmed Jebril, the Syria-based Palestinian who is thought
to have bombed Pan Am flight 103, enrages officials. "We know
the bombing was a Mossad operation," Gen. Tlas says,
referring to Israel's secret service. As proof he offers the
"fact" that 30 rabbis canceled their seats on the plane just
before takeoff, along with the foreign minister of South
Africa.
   Western investigators say that's ridiculous, but such
conspiratorial notions are rife in a capital that regards
itself as the only true champion of the Palestinian cause.
Damascus is headquarters to the "rejection front" of
Palestinian groups opposed to any negotiation with Israel.
Media criticism of Saddam Hussein pales beside the vitriol
aimed at Israeli leaders, who are referred to as "the Zionist
enemy" and often labeled in cartoons with swastikas.
   The wellspring of Syrian bile toward Israel is the Golan
Heights, a strategic highland that Israel has occupied since
the Six-Day War in 1967. The hilltops now bristle with radar
and eavesdropping equipment, underscoring the Syrian sense of
vulnerability; on a clear day, Israeli patrols can see
Damascus across about 40 miles of arid plains.
   Just as Israelis fear Damascus's old dream of a "Greater
Syria," encompassing Israel, Syrians believe that Tel Aviv
craves an "Eretz Israel" stretching from the Nile to the
Euphrates.
   The border town of Kuneitra, destroyed by Israeli troops,
has been left by Syria as a pile of twisted metal and
concrete, a monument to the Israeli occupation. "Destroyed by
the Zionists," says a sign on a gutted hospital, where
busloads of Iranian tourists visited on a recent day. Nearby
is a statue commemorating Suleiman Khater, a crazed Egyptian
who gunned down seven Israeli tourists in the Sinai in 1985
and later died in prison.
   "Even a madman can be a martyr and folk hero if he kills
Israelis," says Mamdou Adwan, a poet and playwright who has
published verse about the Egyptian.
   Mr. Adwan is the rare Syrian who criticizes Mr. Assad's
authoritarian rule. Last year he even signed a manifesto
praising the vilified British author Salman Rushdie. But
asked if he or any other dissident has ever questioned
Syria's stance toward Israel, or its spending 55% of its
budget on arms to achieve "strategic parity" with the Jewish
state, Mr. Adwan laughs. "On this issue," he says, "I doubt
any Syrian has ever had a dissenting thought."
   As with so much in Syria, though, contradictions abound.
Fanatically anti-Zionist, Damascus also is home to 3,000
Jews, many of them prospering. The traditional Jewish quarter
now is heavily populated by Palestinian refugees, who, in
1948, moved into homes vacated by Jews fleeing to Israel.
   "The only thing we don't do together with our Arab
neighbors is pray," says Nassim Hasbani, celebrating the
Jewish New Year at one of the city's 18 synagogues last week.
While it remains hard for Jewish families to emigrate, visa
restrictions are easing, particularly on unmarried women.
   Syria's 280,000 Palestinians, for whom Mr. Assad is a
self-styled liberator, are kept on an even tighter leash.
Distrusted for their support of Yasser Arafat, another
longtime foe of Mr. Assad's, they are denied Syrian passports
and cannot vote for, or serve in, Parliament. A visit to the
closely watched United Nations refugee camps -- fairly easy
in Jordan and Israeli-occupied lands -- requires 10 days'
advance notice in Syria so officials can approve.
   Split vision extends to America. Despite two decades as
the Soviets' main client in the region, Damascus is the most
Western of Arab capitals. Young women in sleeveless blouses
and short skirts, an outfit that would be judged indecent in
Cairo or Riyadh, shop at stores called "Hallo Baby" or eat
ice cream at a parlor called "Alaska." Nightclubs abound, as
do cinemas showing Western movies. Each day at dawn, the line
of Syrians applying for visas to the U.S. stretches around
the block.
   "While Syrians understand the strength of our relationship
with Israel," says U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian, "they
also look at the U.S. as the city on the hill, the
avant-garde nation which is equated with what is new."
   As evidence of warming relations, he points to the release
of some Western hostages held in Lebanon, the toning down of
anti-American propaganda and the ready access U.S. diplomats
have to Mr. Assad, most recently during a visit to Syria by
Secretary of State James Baker.
   "But nothing is swept under the rug, including the issue
of terrorism and human rights," the ambassador says of the
new dialogue. "We're not playing softball here."
   Nor are the Syrians. As part of a growing cultural
exchange between the two countries, the managing editor of
the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, Fayez alSayegh,
recently spent a month touring the U.S. Back in his office in
congested downtown Damascus, he puffs on a Marlboro and puts
the finishing touches on a piece about Montana.
   "The plains are a green dress, embroidered with flowers,"
he reads aloud. Gazing dreamily out at the traffic, he waxes
eloquent about American hospitality (so sincere]), American
airports (so modern]) and American submarine sandwiches (so
big]). "It is a great country," he concludes, "except that
everything in America is subject to the will of the Zionist
lobby."
   It is this abiding anger at U.S. support for Israel that
kindles Syrian support for Iraq, which foreign diplomats and
Syrians say appears to be strong among three-quarters of the
12 million population.
   While many Syrians regard Saddam Hussein as a reckless and
brutal man -- there is little of the adoration for the Iraqi
leader obvious in Jordan -- they respect the guts and power
he has displayed in confronting the U.S. The anti-sheik
strain of Iraqi invective also strikes a chord in Syria, a
poor country often visited by rich Gulf Arabs in search of
drink and sex.
   "Saddam's only mistake," says one student at Damascus
University, "is that he didn't take the whole Gulf while he
had the chance. No Syrian wants to die defending harem sheiks
and Western oil supplies." The pro-Iraq reports on Jordanian
TV picked up in Syria have further fueled Iraqi support,
especially by Palestinians.
   Many Syrians also support Saddam Hussein simply because he
is the foe of their own leader. While Damascus is filled with
stickers and signs proclaiming "We Love Assad" (with a heart
in place of the word "love"), few Syrians express any
affection for their president. An austere figure with a taste
for documentary films and vegetarian food, Mr. Assad has
brought stability to a land that experienced 12 coups in the
two decades before he consolidated power in 1970.
   But his regime runs first and foremost on fear. Among Arab
states, Syria's secret police network is second only to
Iraq's. The Assad regime's brutality became obvious in 1982,
when the crushing of Moslem fundamentalists led to the
destruction of the city of Hama and the massacre of 10,000 or
more of its inhabitants.
   "Since Hama," says a Syrian academic, "public opinion has
stayed very private." While there has been some pro-Iraq
graffiti in recent weeks, no one has yet found evidence to
support reports of riots in eastern Syria.
   Nonetheless, there are signs of insecurity in Damascus. A
BBC correspondent who reported the rumored riots was kicked
out of Syria the same day. Palestinian groups sympathetic to
Iraq have been barred from distributing their literature. The
regime also has launched a rare public-relations campaign,
dispatching party officials to the provinces to defend
Syria's stance.
   While Mr. Assad argues convincingly that Iraq's annexation
of Kuwait undercuts Arab opposition to Israeli occupation,
the essence of his position is a 20-year-old blood feud with
Saddam Hussein over leadership of the Baath Party, and of the
Arab world.
   In an apparent gesture to public opinion, the state-run
Syrian media, which for years derided Saddam Hussein as a
"butcher" and "henchman," has treated the Iraqi president
gingerly since the invasion of Kuwait. And in a major speech
on the Gulf this month, Mr. Assad didn't mention Saddam
Hussein by name, referring only to the blunders of "our
brothers in Iraq," which he said had forced foreign forces to
enter holy Arab soil "to the benefit of the Arab nations'
enemies and in the interests of Zionism, which continually
hatches conspiracies."
   For now, Syrians have no choice but to accept this fig
leaf for Mr. Assad's desire to finally extinguish Saddam
Hussein, which he failed to do by supporting Iran in the
Iran-Iraq war. Most Syrians regard the sending of troops to
the Gulf -- 4,000 so far, expected to grow to 20,000 -- as a
symbolic gesture, though it could quickly become more than
that if shooting breaks out.
   Many Syrians also welcome the economic rewards they may
reap as a result of Mr. Assad's stance. At a time when Soviet
support is slipping, the Gulf states are likely to come to
the rescue of Syria's troubled economy. The European
Community also is planning new loans, and if Syria ever gets
off the State Department list of states supporting terrorism,
it could receive U.S. aid as well. As a modest oil exporter,
Syria already has profited from higher oil prices.
   "If the population has the view that economic paradise is
around the corner, that will go a long way to salving public
opinion," says a Western diplomat. Inflation is over 50% and
decrepitude is obvious throughout Damascus. Ancient buses
lack hoods and belch black fumes; the phone system is a
crackly tangle of crossed lines; even the presidential palace
has dim bulbs and broken elevators.
   But hiking up the six flights of stairs to his office,
presidential adviser Assad Elias warns against thinking that
Syria can be bought or easily influenced. "If good comes to
Syria materially from this, fine," he says. "But the only
payoff we are looking for is something concrete from the U.S.
on the Arab-Israel conflict."
   Mr. Elias and other Syrians want an international
conference leading to Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
lands. But Mr. Adwan, the poet, doubts that even such an
event would soothe Syrians' wounded pride and frustrated
dreams of greatness.
   With typical Syrian indirection, he tells an ancient story
about a knight named al-Muhalel who fights a bloody 40-year
war to avenge the murder of his brother. Peacemakers come to
him and ask, "What is it you want to end this war? Gold?
Camels? Women?" He tells them to ask the daughter of his
murdered brother.
   Her answer: "I want my father."
   Mr. Adwan drains his glass of arrack and smiles wryly. "We
want what we can't have," he says. "We want poetic justice."

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. unveiled a
printer and printer software, the latest weapons in its
battle to crack markets traditionally served by personal
computers.
   Sun's new software, a $495 program called NeWSprint,
breaks ground for Sun, because it allows the company's
workstations to use a much broader range of printers than
before, including inexpensive dot-matrix machines and
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s popular ink-jet printers. Until now,
Sun workstations could "talk" only to printers with
sophisticated processing abilities built in.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The software is part of Sun's two-year strategy of
increasing its share of markets, such as corporate offices,
that mainly use personal computers tied into networks. Sun
has cut prices of some of its machines to less than $5,000,
bringing them to PC price ranges, and has persuaded software
houses, such as Lotus Development Corp., to adapt their PC
software to Sun's workstations.
   But without a printer-software package such as NeWSprint,
which includes fonts, or print typefaces, that are compatible
with Adobe Systems Inc.'s PostScript, Sun's machines couldn't
easily be integrated into many personal-computer networks.
"As far as driving revenue and profit, it's not meaningful,"
Cliff Friedman, an analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said. "But
as far as their two-year goal, it's critical."
   The new software is unique, because it places the
"intelligence" necessary for printing -- the processing of
typefaces and graphics, for example -- in the computer,
rather than in the printer. In a conventional scheme, the
laser printer contains the intelligence, which tends to slow
down the printing process.
   Sun's new Sparcprinter, priced at $2,695, prints twice as
fast as Sun's older, $6,400 LaserWriter. Analysts said that
the printer isn't a threat to more entrenched laser printer
makers, such as Hewlett-Packard, but that it will help Sun
dealers offer more attractively priced computer packages.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun shares
closed at $27.75, up 50 cents, on volume of more than 1.4
million shares.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Film:
   The Coen Brothers Get Serious
   ----
   By Julie Salamon

<LP>
   The first two films of Ethan and Joel Coen, "Blood Simple"
and "Raising Arizona," were high-spirited, unrestrained
pieces of whiz-kid virtuosity. The brothers (Joel directing,
Ethan producing) were like a modern-day vaudeville act. You
could almost hear the barker: "And now presenting . . . the
dynamic duo, up from Minneapolis and into Manhattan . . . the
Coen Brothers]"
   Though much praised by many critics and appreciated by
audiences as well, the Coens were criticized in some quarters
for making pictures that were too cartoonish, maybe for
having too much fun. So now they've decided to show that they
are serious fellows, that they are capable of making Art.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And their new movie, "Miller's Crossing," is artful
indeed. This elegiac gangster movie has some strong writing,
a somber beauty and very good performances all around. But
the Coens seem to have been intent on showing how restrained
they could be, and how deep. They've constructed their
gangsters the way a European who loves American movies (but
who in some fundamental way doesn't really understand them)
might: as brooding creatures with impenetrable psyches whose
every move contains some higher symbolism. In other words,
"Miller's Crossing" is a little pretentious.
   The story revolves around Tommy (Gabriel Byrne), the
enigmatic lieutenant of Leo, the powerful Irish boss in some
unnamed American city, in 1929. The fact that the city is
unnamed may be part of the film's problem. There is a lack of
specificity of detail that makes the picture too much of a
mood piece. There are too many reprises of the image of
Tommy's hat flying through the air, and too little
information about what's happening to whom, when.
   Tommy is a problematic main character because he operates
by keeping everything in. Mr. Byrne has a brooding intensity
but watching him watch everyone, and calculate what to do
next, becomes a little tedious (it doesn't help that Mr.
Byrne's strong Irish accent is somewhat difficult to follow
when he does speak).
   He and Leo have a falling out when Tommy tells Leo they're
involved with the same woman, only Tommy's sleeping with her
and Leo isn't. Tommy takes up with a rival gang, and ends up
setting off a major gang war. The story operates obliquely,
as a series of darkly poetic images that seem to hold a great
deal of significance though it isn't always easy to decipher
what the significance is.
   The woman, Verna, manages to be enigmatic and specific at
the same time. Played by the stage actress Marcia Gay Harden,
who shows enormous promise here in her first film role,
Verna's been hardboiled just the right number of minutes.
   It's Verna's brother Bernie, however, who's the real
catalyst of the action. He's called "shmatta," Yiddish for
rag, and he's the inconsequential little man who can detonate
a war. John Turturro, perpetrator of the amusing caricature
of a Jewish nightclub owner in Spike Lee's "Mo' Better
Blues," runs Bernie through the gamut -- from sniveler to
arrogant conniver, all to great effect.
   Albert Finney's Leo is a compelling figure; a quiet,
courtly man capable of great brutality. But Leo doesn't seem
to get a kick out of it. When he feels he has to inflict pain
it seems to pain him. It's an unpleasant but necessary part
of his job as the main man. Mr. Finney is masterful, as
always, and makes one wish there were more Leo and fewer
hats.

   The gossip columns reported the other day that Katharine
Hepburn didn't care for Clint Eastwood's new film, "White
Hunter, Black Heart." The picture is based on the 1953 Peter
Viertel novel that seemed very much to be the story of John
Huston and the making of "The African Queen," even though Mr.
Viertel said it wasn't.
   It's easy to see why Ms. Hepburn wouldn't like the movie,
since the representation by Marisa Berenson of an actress
called Kay Gibson who appeared to be modeled on Ms. Hepburn
is the weakest of imitations. In fact, we get the impression
that the camera rolled too early and didn't really film the
actors but instead shot the stand-ins used to set the lights
before the actual performers are brought on the set.
   The miscasting started at the top, with Mr. Eastwood
putting himself in the role of Pete Wilson, the compulsive,
arrogant John Huston-like director. Mr. Eastwood gets across
the director's bullheadedness but none of his legendary
charm. His Wilson's a stiff.
   Still, the film is an undeniably compelling portrait of
obsession. Mr. Eastwood's direction, though
characteristically dark, lays the story out with clarity and
intelligence. But the real power lies in the script, which
Mr. Viertel adapted from his book 30 years ago, and which
also was worked on by James Bridges and Burt Kennedy. The
language is tough, smart, sly and cruel. It would have been
great to see John Huston speaking it.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Peter Viertel accompanied John Huston to Africa
to work with him on the script of "The African Queen" about
two years before "White Hunter, Black Heart" was published.
That book, together with Ms. Hepburn's recent account of the
making of that film, are good preparation for the Huston
movie, which gets better and better with each viewing.

   DALLAS -- MCorp said it intends to terminate its pension
plan, which covers about 7,000 current and former employees.
   The bank holding company, reorganizing under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, said the pension plan has assets of
about $80 million, or about $10 million more than current
obligations.

   Termination of the pension plan is subject to approval of
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and the Internal Revenue
Service. If the termination is approved, MCorp expects to
begin making distributions in the second half of 1991, a
company spokesman said.

   Israel Steps Up Golan Heights Activity
   Following Threat by Saddam Hussein

   AYN ZIWAN, Israeli-Occupied Golan Heights -- Officially,
Israel is still maintaining its low-profile policy in the
Persian Gulf crisis, and life on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem
streets continues as usual. But when Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein threatened last Sunday to attack Israel if economic
sanctions "strangle" Iraq, Israeli politicians and soldiers
here redoubled their efforts to prepare.
   The stepped-up pace is readily apparent in the Golan
Heights, the closest point to Iraq's forces. Any Iraqi
missile or aircraft intended to strike Israel would likely
fly overhead. And any attack by ground forces would involve
the thousands of Israeli troops here. "We have to be ready
for anything," says an Israeli lieutenant colonel, pointing
to the area on a map. "We are doing everything we would
normally be doing, but more of it."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Israeli armored patrol vehicles zoom by in a non-stop
stream. The crews are beefing up the Israeli tank and
artillery bases that dot the Golan Heights like gas stations
along a U.S. highway. Across the valley that forms the
no-man's land, Syrian military activity, possibly involving
units that could be sent to bolster the Gulf multinational
force, is picking up as well.
   Military installations across Israel are increasing their
already-heightened level of alert based on Saddam Hussein's
latest threats. "After several weeks of quiet, his latest
threat was somewhat different. It got our attention," says an
Israeli military officer. Previously, Saddam Hussein
threatened to strike only if Iraq were attacked. In response,
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Israel's
Parliament: "We are preparing to forestall the threat,
prevent it (and if he does attack) to retaliate."
   Israeli officials confirm an increase in the number of
sorties flown by Israel's first line of defense, its F-15 and
F-16 fighter jets, since the Gulf crisis began. The air force
continues to bolster resources needed to fend off an Iraqi
air strike. Israel also has deployed an unspecified number of
its Hawk surface-to-air missile batteries along the Jordanian
border.
   Groups from the Israeli Defense Force's 55,000 air force
reservists have been called up to help augment the military
buildup. And Defense Ministry officials have warned that the
additional use of fuel, engines and resources is going to add
roughly $500 million, or roughly 10%, to Israel's annual
military budget, analysts say. That is already translating
into calls for more U.S. military aid.
   The Israelis have put military deployment off-limits to
foreign reporters recently, as they try to keep a low
profile. Israel and the U.S. think everyone's best interests
are served if Israel lies low.
   Says Avi Pazner, adviser to Prime Minister Shamir: "We are
trying to stay out of this. It isn't a conflict with us, but
Saddam Hussein will try to do anything in order to drag us
in. We have to be prepared for the worst, but not do anything
to bring it about."
   In coming weeks, it is likely to become clearer that
Israel faces a dilemma as it assesses its strategic options.
Because it doesn't want to anger the Arabs and jeopardize its
relations with America, it has limited military alternatives
to forestall Iraqi threats. However, Israel also realizes
that the deployment of the multinational force in the Gulf
offers an unprecedented opportunity to remove its current No.
1 enemy: Saddam Hussein.
   "Anything short of a major attempt to dismantle that
monster will leave the entire region, not just us, with a
major problem," says Joseph Alpher, deputy director of the
Jaffee Center for Stategic Studies at Tel Aviv University.
"Otherwise, we are sitting with a ticking time bomb."
   And Israel may be tempted to strike first against Saddam
Hussein if months from now the Gulf crisis appears to be
headed toward a resolution that would leave Iraq's forces
intact and few U.S. troops around. Israel proved with its
attack on an Iraqi nuclear installation in 1981 that is
prepared to strike first to avoid a threat later. "The bets
would be off if they (the multinational force) went home,"
says Mr. Alpher.
   Israeli military officials and analysts are concerned by
the threat of Iraq's missiles, but say these missiles pose
only a moderate threat. In order to reach Israel,
conventional warheads would have to weigh one ton or less --
enough to damage an office building, but not destroy it. Even
if the missiles have chemical warheads, Israeli officials
seem to think the damage could be limited to no more than a
thousand casualties.
   "There is a limited military risk" from a missile attack
but a huge strategic risk that such a move would embroil
Israel in a shooting war, says Gerald M. Steinberg, a
strategic specialist at Israel's Bar Ilan University. Mr.
Steinberg says the Israelis hope America's Desert Shield will
extend to Israel; a U.S. interception of an Iraqi attack
could keep Israel out of the conflict.
   Some Israeli military officials believe the U.S. would
know about a possible Iraqi attack even before Israel. Iraq's
liquidfueled rockets, which require as long as 24 hours to
prepare before launch, could be detected by U.S. spy
satellites and eliminated before they are fired.

   WASHINGTON -- A Senate committee approved a bill revising
the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, including a provision to alter a
monopoly bestowed by the federal government on the maker of
an anti-pneumonia drug for AIDS patients.
   The drug, pentamadine, is manufactured by Lyphomed, a unit
of Japan-based Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., whose U.S.
headquarters are in Deerfield, Ill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lyphomed doesn't have a patent for pentamadine. But under
the 1983 law, the company has exclusive rights to market the
drug to AIDS patients with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
and to HIV-positive patients with T-cell counts below 200.
The orphan-drug designation is designed to encourage drug
companies to market drugs for rare diseases.
   Under the bill, passed on a voice vote yesterday by the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Lyphomed would
retain exclusivity rights for the drug as long as its patient
population remained below 200,000. But if the population grew
beyond 200,000, Lyphomed would lose its exclusivity rights.
The number of HIV-positive patients who may require
pentamadine is believed to be approaching 200,000. The
committee's bill, which is identical to a version passed in
the House, is expected to move quickly through the full
Senate.
   Proposed changes initially sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman
(D., Calif.) would have eliminated three monopolies granted
to Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.; Genentech, San
Francisco; and Lyphomed. But after intense lobbying by Amgen
and Genentech, their products were exempted from the bill.
   Brian Tambi, president and chief operating officer of
Fujisawa's U.S. operations, said the company had been
"singled out in this bill," adding that pharmaceutical
companies in the future would be "extremely careful in
relying on government inducements and commitments."

   Why Some Blacks Fail

   Shelby Steele makes his living as an English professor,
but his skills are those of a thoughtful psychologist. This
combination of qualities -- the sharp insight and the
healer's sympathetic concern -- has helped him write one of
the best books about race that has appeared in America in the
past 25 years, "The Content of Our Character" (St. Martin's,
175 pages, $15.95).
   Many people see race as a political issue, a matter of
power and pressure, entitlements and law. Mr. Steele begins
from a very different place. He was driven to write this book
by what he saw as the emptiness of the political debate about
color. He touches -- often brilliantly -- on many of the
standard public concerns: affirmative action, the crisis of
black leadership, Marion Barry's drug trial, campus racial
problems. But for Mr. Steele, who is black, race relations
cannot be understood except by looking at what happens
between ordinary people in ordinary situations -- and at the
ways black and white people think about themselves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One of his essays grows out of an episode in a washroom in
which a black man guilt-trips his white friend into
overtipping the black attendant. Another chapter dissects the
fleeting fear Mr. Steele once felt that a white woman selling
newspapers might be rude to him. In fact, she was perfectly
polite, but he mines the moment for all it is worth,
painfully examining himself in order to diagnose others.
   All nine of his essays attempt to answer the same
question: Why, after more than 25 years of legal change and
ebbing prejudice, are so many black Americans worse off
today? Mr. Steele poses the question with a
characteristically delicate touch, scrupulously careful not
to overstate the case. Unlike many conservatives who write on
race, he makes poignantly clear that blacks still face plenty
of bias: He himself wears a tie and carries a briefcase to
ensure that no one mistakes him for a menial worker. Yet
unlike some liberal blacks, Mr. Steele also sees -- and
celebrates -- the enormous changes of recent decades. His
family leads an integrated, prosperous, middle-class life,
largely free of any truly hindering discrimination. But Mr.
Steele is determined to understand why many other blacks have
proved unable to take advantage of this freedom.
   His answer is a psychological one, slightly convoluted but
with a sharp ring of truth. In essence, he believes that the
new opportunity blacks face often proves so frightening that
many retreat into a kind of underachiever's sulk. Mr. Steele
does not exactly blame blacks for this; the sympathetic
therapist in him would not allow that. He just explains how
the self-defeating mechanism works: how centuries of
oppression have filled blacks with self-doubt, and how
integration sharpens this doubt by requiring that they
compete with whites. All too often, though, instead of trying
to succeed at school or work, blacks evade their fear of
failure -- what Mr. Steele calls their "inferiority anxiety"
-- by avoiding opportunities and withholding effort. Only
this, Mr. Steele believes, can explain blacks' low grades,
high dropout rate and limited business achievement.
   All of this would be troubling enough, but it is
disastrously compounded by a final twist: Blacks often
explain their failures by blaming whites. Instead of facing
their fears and self-defeating behavior, many pretend to
themselves that their only problem is white racism.
   A different kind of writer would call this pretense a lie
-- and an unusually poisonous lie at that -- but even here
Mr. Steele is more concerned than righteous, more
understanding than polemical. He is deeply pained by the many
blacks who have come to live by this distortion, wasting
their energy exaggerating the prejudice they face. They avoid
the challenges of integration, retreating at school and on
the job into self-segregated enclaves. Many even ostracize
successful blacks -- because their very success exposes the
lie that white racism is an insurmountable barrier.
   Mr. Steele's message for other blacks is simple: Take
responsibility for yourself. White handouts can only prolong
dependency. Blacks must turn away from the "illusion of
deliverance by others," he writes, for "no illusion weakens
us more." The future lies not in collective political action
or a race-based group identity but in ordinary individual
effort and achievement.
   These are simple, old-fashioned values, seemingly
innocuous enough, but in fact Mr. Steele's message is deeply
radical today. By questioning the notion of a race-based
group identity, he is challenging what has become most
blacks' primary belief: that assertive sense of racial
solidarity that underpins everything from the way many vote
to the way they dress and wear their hair. By suggesting that
racial consciousness may be less a strength than a trap, Mr.
Steele is urging blacks to rethink their lives. He also is
asking other Americans to reconsider key ideals -- to
question whether goals such as ethnic pride and "pluralism"
are not in fact more dangerous than we think.
   Already, in spite of himself, Mr. Steele is being drawn
into the political debate. Conservatives, thrilled by his
opposition to affirmative action, have rushed to claim him as
their own, while orthodox black leaders are scrambling to
discredit him. In fact, Mr. Steele has written a far better
book -- far more searching and more challenging -- than
either these self-styled friends or enemies give him credit
for. No one who reads it honestly and with an open mind will
ever think about race in quite the same way again.

   German Defense Minister Looks
   To Send Forces to Trouble Spots

   BONN -- West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
says a priority for the future united-German government must
be to rewrite the constitution to allow the nation to send
armed forces to aid in such places as the Persian Gulf.
   In an interview, the 62-year-old politician also confirmed
that Bonn is negotiating a hefty military aid package for
Turkey, in addition to West Germany's usual military
assistance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   West Germany has been criticized in the U.S. for dragging
its feet in supporting military operations in the Gulf. This
month, after weeks of domestic wrangling, Bonn committed
itself to a package totaling 3.3 billion marks ($2.1
billion), half to aid U.S. forces and the rest to be divided
as economic aid among Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, the three
nations hurt most by the economic blockade of Iraq. The new
military aid package for Turkey would be separate.
   But even such efforts to deflect criticism have begun to
backfire. The aid package for Turkey, which one West German
news report suggests could be valued at 6.5 billion marks, is
at least partly based on military hardware Bonn will inherit
from East Germany after unification Wednesday. Mr.
Stoltenberg dismisses criticism that Bonn is using the
dissolution of East Germany's military as a convenient source
of aid for other nations.
   Bonn was embarrassed this week by reports, later
confirmed, that much of the equipment it's giving to the U.S.
will also come from East German storehouses. The defense
minister says it isn't decided which goods will come from
East Germany, but he didn't rule out the possibility that as
much as half of the material provided to the U.S. will come
from that former communist nation.
   Mr. Stoltenberg is clearly unhappy with a constitutional
provision that forbids Bonn from sending troops outside the
area of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But he says
there isn't any way around it, short of a constitutional
amendment. "I think this is a weak point. It's
unsatisfactory," he says.
   The issue is too sensitive for the West Germans to tackle
when all thoughts are on unification and united-German
elections in December. Mr. Stoltenberg, a leading member of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, says he
expects a new parliament to deal with the subject early next
year. By then the issue may be moot.
   Mr. Stoltenberg says events in the Middle East have
already taken away much of the euphoria associated with the
end of Europe's East-West confrontation.
   "The Gulf crisis makes very clear . . . that we still have
dangerous centers of tension in the neighborhood of Europe,"
he says. "Islamic fundamentalism, Arabian nationalism, the
buildup of a modern military potential -- including, as we
believe, chemical and biological weapons -- this is a very
dangerous combination and underlines for us the paramount
importance of our Atlantic alliance for the future." Mr.
Stoltenberg says a unified Germany, at least under the
right-of-center Christian Democrats, will remain firmly in
the Western alliance.
   The question is what the alliance will look like. Mr.
Stoltenberg says tighter economic and political links should
make for a stronger "European pillar" in Western defenses.
Indeed, the West German defense minister is unequivocally
pro-U.S. "There is no progress without a strong link between
North America and Western Europe," he says.
   Still, both sides of the Atlantic are getting ready for
deep cuts in European forces. Conventional arms talks between
NATO and what's left of the East's Warsaw Pact are expected
to cut numbers across the board; Germany has pledged to trim
the size of its unified forces to 370,000 within four years.
   But foreign troops stationed on German soil will remain
part of the West's defense equation, says Mr. Stoltenberg.
"We are prepared for a substantial reduction of American
troops in Germany and Central Europe, and I think it will go
beyond those 60,000 who are set to go out in the next few
years," he says, referring to a U.S. plan to shrink the U.S.
presence to 190,000 troops, from the current 250,000.
   "But we believe it's very important, even at a lower
level, to keep substantial U.S. forces in Central Europe,"
says Mr. Stoltenberg, who estimates that total foreign troop
presence in Germany in five years could be 150,000 to
170,000, compared with more than 400,000 today. He opposes
any single nation removing all of its troops, a move he says
would send the wrong signal about the future of the alliance.
   But while he's a firm believer in the alliance, Mr.
Stoltenberg doesn't see NATO expanding to include any of the
new democracies of Eastern Europe. Instead, he foresees an
era in which these nations cooperate with the West on a wide
range of issues through the much looser structure of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a grouping
that brings together East and West European nations, the
U.S., and Canada. Military matters, such as the Middle East,
can be dealt with much more easily in the United Nations, he
says.

   TORONTO -- The Canadian Auto Workers union set a strike
deadline of midnight EDT on Oct. 10 to reach a new contract
covering about 36,000 employees of the Canadian subsidiary of
General Motors Corp.
   Contract negotiations got under way yesterday, three days
after union members ratified a new three-year pact with Ford
Motor Co.'s Canadian unit, ending a nine-day strike.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CAW president Robert White said he expects GM to accept
about the same economic terms as those agreed upon with Ford.
That pact gives workers wage gains of 3% in the first year
and 2% in the second and third years, plus protection against
inflation. The Ford contract also includes more time off the
job, a vacation bonus and an income security package that
would take effect in the event of layoffs.
   Frederick Curd, GM Canada's chief negotiator, called the
CAW's demands "expensive." He said, however, that GM could
accept the union's terms if the contract also provided a
"framework for improvements in {the company's} operational
efficiencies."
   Mr. Curd said he hasn't yet tabled specific proposals to
improve GM's "cost competitiveness" in Canada. But he
identified certain areas where the company would like to make
progress. These include changing the union's system of job
classifications to create a more flexible work force. He also
said he would ask the union to help address attendance
problems at GM's Canadian plants, where absenteeism runs
about 4% higher than at U.S. plants.
   The CAW's Mr. White said that, besides monetary issues,
the CAW would press for resolution of matters affecting
individual local union affiliates.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Alan Bond resigned as chairman and
director of the company he founded, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.,
in an apparent move to pave the way for the foundering
concern to be restructured.
   Peter Lucas, a Bond Corp. director and the company's chief
spokesman, was named chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bond in July foreshadowed his intention to step down
if European holders of certain Bond Corp.-related securities
would approve the proposed sale of the company's Australian
breweries. The breweries are one of the last remaining major
assets of a far-flung corporate empire that spanned property,
media and telecommunications, natural resources and brewing.
   Bond Corp. proposes to sell the breweries to its 58%-owned
unit Bell Resources Ltd., which in turn plans to sell half a
stake in the breweries to Lion Nathan Ltd., a New Zealand
brewer.
   The European investor group is expected to meet in London
Thursday, and some of those investors have been discussing a
plan to swap their debt for a stake in Bond Corp. If that
takes place, further changes in Bond Corp.'s management are
likely. As part of his commitment to the investor group, Mr.
Bond has said he will reduce his voting rights in Bond Corp.
to 25% from about 58% currently.
   A spokesman in London for the investor group wasn't
immediately available to comment.
   Even if the European investor group approves the
breweries' sale, it could still come unstuck unless a group
of investors that hold $510 million in debentures issued by
Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. in the U.S. agree to sell their
securities back to the company at a discount.
   Bond Corp. said several of its long-time executives also
resigned Wednesday. They include Tony Oates, who was in
charge of the company's finances, and Peter Mitchell, who
headed corporate development. The three men, though, plan to
stay on as consultants until the proposed breweries' sale and
shareholder restructuring are completed.
   As the company has run into financial trouble and
Australian securities regulators launched investigations into
its affairs, a number of directors have resigned.
   Some Bond Corp. watchers think the steps by Mr. Bond and
other executives to distance themselves from the company may
also be aimed at taking the steam out of a special
investigation into the company's affairs by Australia's
corporate watchdog. However, Charles Williams, deputy
chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission,
said the resignations won't affect the probe.

   WARNING FOR FRENCH INDUSTRY

   France's government is urging French industry to avoid
close ties to Japanese companies, France's Industry Minister
said.
   The minister, Roger Fauroux, said Britain's auto industry
now is almost totally dependent on Japanese partners and on
Japanese-owned factories. He said he once asked Nicholas
Ridley, before the British official resigned as trade
minister, what was left of the United Kingdom's auto
industry, and Mr. Ridley replied, "Zero, sir."
   "If Renault had invited the Japanese into its capital --
as did the British -- the French auto industry would have
gone the same way as the British. It would have disappeared,"
Mr. Fauroux said. Instead, Renault arranged a share-swap with
Sweden's AB Volvo.
   "If we worked with the Japanese we would turn out the same
way as the British auto industry: Zero, sir," Mr. Fauroux
said.
                                                                                                       

   ROMANIA'S RECREATION OFFER
                                                                                                       

   Washington is studying Bucharest's offer to turn Romanian
resorts into recreation centers for U.S., Canadian and
British forces in the Mideast. "We have taken the offer into
consideration and we are thinking it over," said a spokesman
at the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest. Under the offer, Romania
would provide 3,000 to 4,000 beds in luxury hotels and villas
free of charge to the troops and their families.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPE'S INEFFICIENT BANKING
                                                                                                       

   The European Community urged banks to make cash transfers
within the EC faster and cheaper for consumers and small
businesses. The EC said the present, haphazard system of
transferring money from one country to another is inefficient
and expensive. It cited examples of what consumers or small
businesses face when trying to pay or collect bills in
another country. In one, a Belgian resident who had recently
received a French check for 300 French francs ($57) was
charged a commission and fees by a Belgian bank equal to
nearly 25% of its value to process the check.
                                                                                                       

   LOG HOUSES FOR JAPAN
                                                                                                       

   Itoman &amp; Co., a Japanese trading house, said it is
starting a joint venture with Toocx Co., an Osaka
construction company, to market log houses. The new concern,
Itoman Canadian Logark Co., will be set up in Osaka on Oct.
1. The joint venture will import logs from Canada through a
subsidiary in Vancouver and assemble log houses in Japan for
sale; the logs will be prepared for assembly in Canada by
Canadian log builders in accordance with designs and
specifications sent from customers in Japan.
                                                                                                       

   HELP FOR SPAIN'S BEST HOTELS
                                                                                                       

   Spain may cut the value-added tax on four-star hotels in
the 1991 budget to help boost a flagging tourist trade.
Tourism, Communications and Transport Minister Jose
Barrionuevo said the government was considering an offer by
the hotel sector to freeze its prices in exchange for a
reduction in the 12% VAT rate. A reduction would affect about
380 hotels. Earlier, the minister had predicted that revenue
from tourism, which accounts for 40% of Spain's foreign
income, would fall by up to 10% in 1990.
                                                                                                       

   RICE FARMERS' RALLY
                                                                                                       

   More than 5,000 farmers from around Japan gathered in
Tokyo yesterday to demand that Japan not give in to foreign
requests that it end its ban on rice imports. The farmers,
many of them elderly, sat in the rain at a rally in a public
park and applauded speakers who insisted that the country
resist calls for it to allow rice imports. "Stop U.S. rice,"
said one banner hoisted by the crowd.
                                                                                                       

   GLOBAL PHONE STUDY
                                                                                                       

   A new study shows that people in Scandinavian countries
have among the lowest telephone bills in the developed world.
   Comparing costs for identical telecommunications services
around the world, the study by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development found that Icelandic and Danish
businesses pay the least -- 58% less than the average.
Spanish businesses pay the most, 45% above average.
   The OECD found little economic logic in the wide
differences. But generally in Western Europe, it is cheaper
to use the phone in a small or a northern country than in a
big or a southern one. And countries with high costs often
have phone companies with fat profits: In 1987, by OECD
formulas, Spain's Telefonica had a 23.5% profit margin,
compared with the developed-world average of 7.8%.
   High prices don't guarantee good service: In Spain, 17.6%
of international calls don't get through because of equipment
problems.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Power failures, lack of public transportation and a cash
shortage due to a prolonged bank strike frustrated Greeks
yesterday as the second 48-hour nationwide walkout within a
week got under way. The strike is in protest against economic
austerity and proposed legislation overhauling health and
pension plans. . . . A Norwegian multimillionaire made
front-page news in Oslo by paying income tax when he owed
none. Shipowner and investor Knut Utstein Kloster sent a
voluntary payment of $130,000 to the Oslo tax office.
"Everyone should pay tax," he told a newspaper.

   U.S. Asks `Substantial' Term for Milken,
   Beyond Boesky's Three-Year Sentence
   ----

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The government, as expected, urged a federal
judge to sentence Michael Milken to a "substantial" prison
term for six securities-related crimes to which he pleaded
guilty in April.
   The government specifically urged that Mr. Milken get more
than the three-year sentence received by Ivan F. Boesky, the
convicted former stock speculator who cooperated with the
government's investigation of insider trading and other
securities crimes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for Mr. Milken acknowledged that he
engaged in a dozen additional transactions -- to which he did
not plead guilty -- that furthered an illegal conspiracy with
Mr. Boesky.
   The admission came in response to an order from U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood that the attorneys provide
additional information about Mr. Milken's activities with Mr.
Boesky. Mr. Milken, the former junk-bond chief at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge
Wood on Monday.
   In a sentencing memo made public on Tuesday, Mr. Milken's
lawyers urged Judge Wood to sentence Mr. Milken to community
service, saying he was a decent and charitable man who was
remorseful about any wrongs he had committed.
   In contrast, the government's memo depicted Mr. Milken as
a man who systematically used his firm's junk-bond
department, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., to pursue his
illegal activity. According to the memo, the department
became "the means through which Milken rewarded his friends,
defeated his rivals and committed his crimes." Mr. Milken's
objectives, the government said, "were simple: power and
wealth."
   Although Mr. Milken's lawyers have said that he intends to
cooperate with the government after he is sentenced, the
government indicated that it has doubts about Mr. Milken's
willingness to do so.
   "Our confidence in Milken's intention to be truthful and
forthcoming has waned," the memo stated, because "nothing
about Milken's conduct to date suggests the contrition or
remorse that often predicts sincere cooperation by a
defendant."
   One of the crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty last
April involved a conspiracy to commit illegal trades with Mr.
Boesky that included transactions other than those to which
Mr. Milken pleaded guilty. But Mr. Milken never said what the
other trades were, and Judge Wood said on Monday that to
issue an appropriate sentence she needed to know more about
them.
   In response, Arthur Liman, the lead attorney for Mr.
Milken, wrote a letter to the judge listing additional
transactions.
   When he entered his plea last April, Mr. Milken said he
forced an unwilling Fischbach Corp. into the hands of
corporate raider Victor Posner by having Mr. Boesky take a
large and unlawfully secret position in the company's stock.
Mr. Milken also said he helped Mr. Boesky evade net-capital
rules and used Mr. Boesky to artificially support the price
of MCA Inc. common stock while Golden Nugget Inc., a Drexel
client, was selling its MCA shares.
   In the letter to Judge Wood, Mr. Liman said that Mr.
Milken had further assisted Mr. Boesky in evading net-capital
requirements by secretly agreeing to buy American
Broadcasting Cos. and Enserch Corp. securities from him in
early 1985, with the understanding that the securities would
be bought back later at no loss to Drexel.
   Mr. Liman also detailed securities trades in eight
different companies that were intended to enable Boesky to
recoup losses he had suffered on other illegal trades with
Mr. Milken. These compensatory trades, which occurred in
1985, involved securities of Leasco, First Texas, Valero
Energy Corp., MCI Communications Corp., Wickes Cos., Republic
Airlines, MSA Realty Corp. and MSA Shopping Corp.
   Mr. Liman also said that Mr. Milken had encouraged Mr.
Boesky to invest in securities of Diamond Shamrock Corp. and
Harris Graphics Corp., with the understanding that Drexel
would share in any of the profits Mr. Boesky derived.

   EMERGENCY ROOM "shopping" grows as inner-city residents
seek suburban care.
   Faced with long waits in overburdened city hospitals, some
people with non-traumatic illness travel to cleaner, quieter
ERs nearby. "The word in the ghetto is if you get injured,
don't call an ambulance. Call a taxi; get a friend to take
you," says David Langness of the Hospital Council of Southern
California. Frequent "ER gridlock" in Los Angeles hospitals
makes carpetbagging notable there. "But it's beginning to be
a national trend," Mr. Langness says. In Dallas, where ER
visits can last 12 to 20 hours, some patients head for
suburban Richardson Medical Center.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But health-care economics keep many patients in cities
like New York, where ERs must accept all walk-ins regardless
of ability to pay. That puts budgets under pressure at a time
when government aid is sliding and use of the ER for routine
care is rising. One help: walk-in clinics, like the one at
Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. Open 16 hours a day,
the clinic relieves the ER of many patients. In New Jersey,
where hospitals bill a percentage of uncompensated costs to
paying patients, a recent report backs a "fast track" system
to speed minor cases through the ER.
   Parkland Memorial's emergency room manages to collect only
about 17 cents of every dollar it's due.
                                                                                                       

   "SEATTLE BEIGE," a recycled paint, helps win a creative
government award.
   The Ford Foundation and Harvard University's 1990
Innovations in State and Local Government Awards include
Seattle's major recycling program; Iowa's efforts to save
family farms through better debt management; Ramsey County,
Minn.'s program to dispense welfare payments through
automated teller machines and the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey's Xport progam, which helps small companies to
export. The 10 awards, to be announced tomorrow, include
$100,000 grants.
   The Seattle program was born of necessity in 1987, when
environmental problems forced closing the city's two
landfills. Facing sharply higher disposal costs, it launched
a sweeping, recycling program. Now it runs 16 services
ranging from routine paper and glass pickup to turning junk
mail into fiberboard. It sells "Seattle beige," a blend of
old paints, for $5 a gallon.
                                                                                                       

   GO WEST and East, young draftsman. Architects look abroad
for projects.
   While development languishes in many U.S. cities,
architects envision building in Asia, and Eastern Europe.
Joseph A. Gonzalez, design partner in Skidmore, Owings &amp;
Merrill, Chicago, says his firm's business mix is about half
and half these days, compared with about 30% overseas and 70%
domestic five years ago. "In the next two to three years it
may flip over" with foreign work dominating, he says.
Skidmore, which put the Sears Tower and the John Hancock
Building on the map, points to Asia, notably Japan, Korea and
Indonesia.
   New York architect Alan Lapidus sees a future in
renovating the Old Country. With European unification
unfolding, he figures that in four years or so, "we would
have one-third to half our business overseas." First: tourist
accommodations. "Europe is under-hoteled," says Mr. Lapidus.
There's business in gutting and re-doing the "old, quaint and
crummy" hotels along with tastefully adding technology to the
grand, old classics. Next: the convention hotel.
   Poland's press agency reports 17 hotels on the drawing
board in Warsaw.
                                                                                                       

   SADDAM THERMOSTAT] Home heating-oil bills may jump 50% to
60% this winter, a future issue of Barnard's Retail Marketing
Report says. Homeowners who paid $1,000 last winter may pay
$1,500 or $1,600.
                                                                                                       

   CLASS NOTES OF '91: Boston University School of Law
reports that environmental law is the vogue -- class
registration soars 400% in six years; St. Lawrence University
in Canton, N.Y., sends parents audio cassettes describing
historic sites along the interstate heading to the rustic
campus; the University of Connecticut student credit union
offers bonus interest for A grades.
                                                                                                       

   PARK, SHOP, WORK, SHOP. A $37 million, 15-story parking
garage with stores, child care and shuttle service for
downtown workers is planned for Los Angeles. The idea: unlock
gridlock.

   NOTHING VENTURED, nothing developed, big drug firms find.
   Pharmaceutical companies increasingly provide capital for
fledgling biotechnology firms. Of the 262 alliances arranged
by drug concerns last year, 200 were related to biotech
research companies, according to accountants Ernst &amp; Young.
And, 75% of all biotechnology firms have an average of three
strategic partners -- mostly international pharmaceutical
firms.
   "The size and experience of the big pharmaceutical
companies is helping partners better focus on goals and
stepping up their development," notes New York venture
capitalist Walter Channing. Marion Merrell Dow, Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Eli Lilly, and Glaxo Holdings PLC, top the list of
biotech allies who offer both cash and research support. Last
month, Glaxo invested $20 million in three-year old Gilead
Sciences, Foster City, Calif., to develop anti-cancer drugs.
   Still, too much capital can discourage ventures by hurting
entrepreneurial incentive, Mr. Channing warns.

   Dear Mr. Gorbachev:
   Your economy is a shambles, everyone is afraid to lend
money to or invest in your People's Republic, government-run
services are costly and inefficient, your streets are filled
with potholes, there is political turmoil and anyone who can
leave your workers' paradise is packing their bags.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I sympathize -- we have the same situation here in
Philadelphia.
   A few weeks ago, the bond-rating agencies dropped
Philadelphia's debt rating to junk-bond status. Our Finance
Director says we'll run out of cash in 12 to 18 weeks. For
the past three weeks the city government has been unable to
sell $450 million worth of bonds needed to cover its deficit
-- the third in three years.
   Like yours, our government is the largest employer in our
region and controls a sizeable portion of the economy. In
order to pay for this, it confiscates a large chunk of the
citizens' wealth, and redistributes it, via a 5% gross wage
tax, ruinous property taxes, a "business privilege" tax, a
tax on gross business revenues, a 4.9% real estate transfer
tax and a host of others.
   Preliminary census figures released last week show that in
the past 10 years, Philadelphia has lost 9% of its population
to the surrounding suburbs. In 1940, six out of 10 people in
our region lived in the City of Philadelphia. Today, only
three out of 10 live in the city.
   The solutions offered by our mayor and the people who hope
to succeed him probably sound familiar to you: Philadelphia
needs to get more money from other governments; it needs "new
leadership" and "cooperation"; it must reform the system;
and, it must raise taxes and reduce services -- again. All
agree that the city's problems are not its own fault.
   I propose we adopt the proposals of free-marketeers in the
Soviet Union and begin by privatizing three of Philadelphia's
urban "collective farms": our sanitation department, our
school system and our mass transit agency.
   Philadelphia has the highest garbage collection costs of
any major city in the U.S., and we councilmembers get
complaints about the service constantly. In 1988, the city
government asked private enterprises if they could do a
better job. Two companies offered to collect the city's
garbage on time, at approximately half the price the city now
pays, saving $80 million a year. They backed their offers
with million-dollar performance bonds. The powerful garbage
collective here wouldn't let it happen.
   A few months ago, property taxes were raised again to
cover the $44 million deficit of the school system -- a
system in which only 28% of students passed a statewide test
of basic reading and math, and a system that operates some
schools in which not a single student passed. A system where
only 41% of the Class of '88 graduated, and where 37% of
Hispanic students drop out before their senior year. The
government school's test scores are much lower than those of
non-government schools that teach the same inner city
children. And the government schools operate at twice the
cost of the average non-government school. But when I suggest
that parents be given education vouchers so they can choose
among competing schools and decide where their education
dollars will be spent, I'm accused of being un-American]
   Even though SEPTA, Philadelphia's government-owned mass
transit agency, has the highest fares in the nation and
receives a $45 million annual subsidy from city taxpayers,
it's asking for even more money to cover its $30 million
deficit. SEPTA says if it doesn't get what it wants, it will
shut the system down or severely cut back service. Private
operators are ready to provide an alternative to the
government-operated system at savings of 40% to 60%, but they
aren't allowed to. Here in the Cradle of Liberty, it's
illegal to compete with government buses.
   All three of these government-operated monopolies are run
for the benefit of the managers and employees. Salaries are
not based on performance and budgets are determined by
political jockeying among committees with insufficient
information. Sound familiar? Large, central government
bureaucracies then force the citizens to buy poor quality
services in insufficient quantity at high prices. A lot of us
are excited to hear about your move to democracy, but
economic liberty is just as important.
   We used to understand the benefits of liberty here in
Philadelphia. As I walk to my office in City Hall, I pass an
old red-brick building with a bell in front of it. There are
always scores of tourists -- many from your part of the world
-- waiting in line to go inside this building and touch the
bell. They are just discovering something that many in
Philadelphia have forgotten. Not only is liberty right.
Liberty works.
   If events over there get you down, I invite you to come to
Philadelphia and touch the Liberty Bell with me. What it
stands for may help both of us solve our common problem.

   LONDON -- The tiny Baltic Futures Exchange plans to merge
with the London Futures and Options Exchange to regenerate
slack business.
   Volume on the Baltic Futures Exchange, which trades grain,
potatoes, freight futures and other commodities, is less than
a tenth of the four million to five million contracts traded
on what is informally called the London "Fox."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   London's commodity markets are the largest in Europe, but
are small when compared with those in New York and Chicago.
   "By merging with London Fox we will be able to develop our
existing contracts and expand into new areas," said Pat
Elmer, chairman of the Baltic Futures Exchange. London Fox
actively trades coffee, cocoa and sugar and has launched
several contracts on an automated trading system.
   Saxon Tate, chairman of London Fox, said the Baltic
contracts have "great potential." If members of both
exchanges approve the merger, the markets will have greater
resources for future development, he said.
   London Fox plans to launch an Arabica coffee futures
contract to trade alongside futures on the lower-quality
robusta coffee. It is also examining the possibility of
contracts in property and electricity futures, and is
considering links with Japanese futures markets, the exchange
said.

officer of Maxxam. He succeeds James V. Iaco Jr., 46, who
announced in June that he would resign because of the
company's relocation to Houston from Los Angeles, recently
completed. Mr. La Duc continues as Kaiser Aluminum's vice
president and chief financial officer.
   Maxxam is engaged in aluminum, forest products and real
estate operations.

   Ted Turner got to keep his Goodwill Games.
   The board of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. yesterday
voted unanimously to hold a third Goodwill Games in Leningrad
and Moscow in 1994, and to sell broadcast rights to about 20%
of the games to ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Terms
weren't disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting, based in Atlanta, will air the rest
of the games on its cable networks, and -- unlike this year's
event -- it won't charge cable operators any special
surcharges to carry the games.
   The first two quadrennial games, in Moscow in 1986 and in
Seattle this summer, had losses totaling $70 million, so
approval by the large cable operators that control Turner
Broadcasting's board wasn't certain. But executives close to
the company said Mr. Turner was insistent that the games go
on, and the cable operators on the board, who were no longer
being asked to shoulder special carriage fees, relented.
   Mr. Turner said in a statement, "We are confident {that
the games} will only grow in stature during the next decade."
   Jack Kelly, president of the Goodwill Games, said ABC will
broadcast, on three consecutive weekends, a total of 15 to 18
hours of the 21-day event. That leaves Turner Broadcasting
with about 70 hours of programming on weekdays and weekend
evenings. No decision has been made whether Turner
Broadcasting will show the games on its Turner Network
Television channel or its superstation WTBS.
   Mr. Kelly said ABC and Turner Broadcasting will share the
premier events, like track and basketball, and the
less-glamorous sports, like judo and team handball.
   Though Mr. Kelly said the ABC pact is still being worked
out, an executive close to both companies said ABC had
offered Turner Broadcasting $20 million, plus production
expenses, to air virtually the same package -- including
three Saturday evenings -- for the Seattle games. But Turner
Broadcasting's board rejected the offer, because it wanted to
keep the games as a cable-TV exclusive, this executive said.
   The change of heart seems to have been motivated by the
games' large losses. Mr. Kelly said exposure on ABC will help
give the games more publicity -- a critical problem this
year. He said the board asked for "very conservative"
financial estimates for the 1994 games, and he obliged: His
budget of $70 million to $80 million is about 20% smaller
than the one for this year's games.
   "We've put together a business plan that doesn't show
anywhere near" the past losses, Mr. Kelly said.
   For ABC, the Goodwill Games will provide sports
programming -- albeit briefly -- for the dog days of
midsummer, when, except for baseball, the networks don't have
much to highlight on weekend afternoons. And despite the
first two games' disappointing ratings, Dennis Swanson,
president of ABC Sports, said "We're excited about. . .
having an event of its caliber as part of our 1994
programming line-up."

   Par and Quad were fined earlier this year for illegal

   Money Fund Yields
   Rose Only Slightly
   In Latest Week

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
</IN>
<LP>
   Investors continued to put cash into taxable money-market
mutual funds as yields edged up fractionally.
   Assets of 483 taxable funds rose by $789.4 million in the
week ended Tuesday, to $402.1 billion, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The average seven-day
compound yield, which assumes reinvestment of dividends,
inched up to 7.75% from 7.74%, the Holliston, Mass.,
newsletter reported.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There's no indication yields are likely to change much
anytime soon. Average maturity of the funds' investments,
including Treasury bills, short-term corporate debt and bank
certificates of deposit, remained unchanged at a fairly long
46 days.
   Meanwhile, Dreyfus Corp. announced a change that will
slightly reduce the yield on its top-yielding Dreyfus
Worldwide Dollar fund. Effective Monday, Dreyfus said it will
begin allocating to the fund operating expenses equal to
0.05% of assets. In the latest week, the fund's seven-day
compound yield was 8.60%.
   Dreyfus had been absorbing all management fees and
operating expenses since Worldwide Dollar began operating in
February 1989 as a way of boosting yield. It has attracted
nearly $9 billion in assets in its 19 months of operations.
   Based on the latest data from Donoghue's, Dreyfus would
still be the top fund even if its yield were reduced by 0.05
percentage point. The No. 2 fund, Alger Money Market
Portfolio, had a seven-day compound yield of 8.51% in the
latest week. Six of the top 10 taxable funds, including
Alger, are absorbing all or part of their fees and expenses,
according to Donoghue's.
   Dreyfus advertising has stressed that it will continue to
absorb all "management" fees, equal to 0.5% of assets, at
least through June 1991. But it has also reserved the right
to gradually begin allocating "operating" expenses to the
fund. Current operating expenses of the fund, which include
such things as registration costs and custodial fees, are
equal to 0.24% of assets, according to Dreyfus.
   The average "expense ratio" for money funds, which
includes operating expenses and management fees, is 0.65% of
assets, said Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's. If fully
passed on to investors, Worldwide Dollar's expense ratio
would total 0.74%.
   The Donoghue's newsletter, which reports money fund yields
and assets weekly, said the average seven-day simple yield of
the taxable funds edged up to 7.47% from 7.46% in the latest
week. The average 30-day simple yield remained at 7.47% and
the average 30-day compound yield stayed at 7.75%. Total
assets for the week ended Sept. 18 were adjusted to $401.4
billion because of an inaccurate report from one fund last
week, Donoghue's said.
   Assets of the 234 tax-exempt money funds tracked by
Donoghue's fell by $449.4 million to $80.4 billion in the
latest week, while yields rose. The average seven-day
compound yield of the tax-free funds, for instance, jumped to
5.65% from 5.56%. The latest yield is equal to a taxable
yield of 7.85% for investors in the 28% tax bracket and 8.43%
for someone paying 33%.
   Average maturity of the tax-free funds' investments
shortened by two days to 57 days.

   Wall Street Parched as Stock Issues
   Dry Up Under Glare of Gulf Crisis

   NEW YORK -- The Mideast crisis has sabotaged one of Wall
Street's biggest moneymakers.
   The market for new stock issues, which had been one of the
hottest areas in the securities business before August, has
slowed to a trickle since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Previously, Wall Street firms had earned fat fees by buying
new stock from corporate issuers and reselling them to the
public.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The volume of new stock offerings has plunged 48%, to $3.2
billion thus far this quarter from $6.1 billion in the third
quarter of 1989. Initial public stock offerings have taken it
on the chin even harder, dropping 59% from the year earlier.
   The reason is simple: Economic uncertainty triggered by
skyrocketing oil prices has whacked the stock market, which
has fallen 18% from its record level shortly before the
invasion. Many corporations looking to sell stock therefore
are hanging back, hoping for higher prices when the dust
settles.
   "The uncertainty emanating from the Iraqi Mideast crisis
has caused gridlock in the equity marketplace," says Michael
Madden, co-head of investment banking at Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   The pullback in stock issues has hit Wall Street where it
hurts. Wall Street firms typically get fatter fees for
underwriting stock issues than for debt. So far this year,
according to Securities Data Co., investment banks have
earned an average fee of $2.7 million for underwriting stock
issues, and $3 million for each IPO -- far higher than the
$1.1 million average for corporate debt offerings.
   "This had been one of the few areas that produced the kind
of returns on capital you need in this business," said T.
Anthony Brooks, a managing director of First Boston Corp.
   Since the Iraqi invasion, 22 stock issues have been
postponed, while 34 have come to market, Securities Data
says. On Aug. 24, for instance, Sun Microsystems Inc. pulled
an offering of 7 million shares, or $217 million, after its
stock price sank from $31 to $25.375 a share. Sun chairman
Scott McNealy explained that market conditions "clearly have
deteriorated."
   A week after the invasion, May Department Stores Inc.
yanked a $34 million stock issue for its Venture Stores Inc.
unit, citing "market conditions." Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. shelved plans to sell shares in two $60 million funds
investing, respectively, in Spain and New Zealand. And last
week, King World Productions Inc. withdrew a $36 million
stock offering tied to a program development unit.
   There are other reasons that new stock offerings have
slowed. Wall Street executives say investors want to avoid
the shares of companies burdened by heavy debt loads, at a
time when scores of leveraged companies have developed
financial problems. Before the Mideast crisis, when the
market was still riding high, some companies that had
undergone leveraged buy-outs sold stock to the public in
socalled reverse LBOs. "Investors are getting particularly
concerned about credit quality," says Clayton Rhorbach, head
of equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   With oil prices soaring, investors still have an appetite
for stock issues related to the energy business. Salomon
Brothers Inc. last week led a $41 million stock offering for
Grant Norpac, an energy exploration services company. And
Orex Energy Co. plans to sell 7.3 million shares currently
owned by charitable trusts, worth about $333 million.
   Nearly one-third of all new stock issues this quarter have
been by companies in oil and natural resources, according to
Securities Data. Gold stocks, in particular, have gained from
oil-related inflation fears.
   Thomas Pratt, contributing editor of the IPO Reporter
newsletter, says that September shapes up as the slowest
month for new stock issues since November 1987, the month
that followed the stock market crash.
   And don't look for the picture to brighten any time soon.
The volume of new stock issues probably won't pick up until
the outlook for the economy and the outcome in the Mideast
become clearer.
   "The markets abhor uncertainty, and whatever you believe
about the Mideast, it's certainly uncertain, and therefore
the markets aren't receptive," says Denis Bovin, a managing
director at Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Wall Street is still holding out hope for the long term,
however, banking on the expected need for new equity by many
debt-burdened companies. But for now, Morgan Stanley's Mr.
Rohrbach says business remains slow.
   "Every morning my staff brings me a Street-wide offering
calendar, a sheet with all the deals announced, deals priced,
and their performance in the secondary market," he says.
"These days the sheet is almost empty."

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Litton Industries Inc. said it

interest accrued to Nov. 15.
   Litton said last month it planned to redeem the notes when
it announced a $1 billion offering of zero-coupon bonds. The
redemption will be funded with the $258 million net proceeds
from that offering and from internal cash, Litton said.
</LP>

   Litton, a diversified technology concern, said the notes
will be redeemed at company headquarters here or at the
Midwest Securities Exchange Clearing Corp. in New York.
Interest on the notes will cease to accrue after the
redemption date, Litton said.
   "The redemption will strengthen the company's balance
sheet and improve our positive cash flow," Litton said. A
notice of redemption will be mailed to noteholders within the
next few days, the company said.

   U.S. to Withdraw
   12% of Its Troops
   In Europe in '91

   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon, anticipating the signing of a
conventional arms-control treaty for Europe, said it will
withdraw 40,000 of the roughly 325,000 U.S. troops there
during the next fiscal year.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said, "We have to begin the
drawdown now to respond in an orderly way to changing
security requirements and declining defense budgets."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The roughly 12% cut, which involves 30,000 Army troops and
10,000 Air Force members, is likely to be only the first
required under the treaty that the U.S. hopes will be signed
as early as November. At one point, the U.S. pledged to
withdraw 100,000 troops under the pact and, now that the
Soviet Union is pulling all of its troops from Europe by
1994, the eventual U.S. cut is likely to be even larger than
100,000.
   The treaty won't directly require troop withdrawals.
Instead, it will require massive cuts in tanks and other
weapons, in effect, forcing the disbanding of units and the
withdrawal of their members.
   Under the troop-withdrawal plan announced yesterday, the
40,000 troops will be returned to the U.S., and their
European-based units will be disbanded. The Pentagon didn't
offer any details of the units involved but said that the
plan conforms to a list of European base closings announced
by Mr. Cheney last week, and that the plan is likely to
affect Germany the most.
   The Pentagon said that the withdrawals won't start before
January and that they will be phased in through the remainder
of the year that ends Sept. 30, 1991. That means no large
number of troops will be available for deployment to the
Persian Gulf during the current buildup.
   A Pentagon spokesman said the move is "unrelated" to the
Gulf operation, though the Pentagon isn't ruling out the
possibility that some of the troops might eventually be
assigned there.
   Completion of the treaty, on which the withdrawal is
based, is currently snagged over negotiating differences
between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Secretary of State James
Baker met yesterday in New York with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze in an effort to overcome the differences.
   "In the event that the treaty is delayed," a Pentagon
spokesman said, "we'll examine the implications for this"
withdrawal.

   To Post a Loss;

   Meridian Bancorp expects to report a third-quarter loss of
$35 million to $39 million, after boosting its loan-loss
reserves by $75 million and taking one-time charges for the
sale of several businesses.
   "Economic conditions have deteriorated and we felt it was
time to beef up our reserves and strengthen our capital
position," said Samuel A. McCullough, chairman and chief
executive officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In recent years, the Reading, Pa., bank company was intent
on diversifying its earnings base by moving into a variety of
non-banking businesses. But now with a softening economy and
troubled real estate markets, management has decided to sell
some of these operations that aren't profitable. The bank
will also leave businesses in which it doesn't have the
critical mass needed to compete with big major-city banks.
   Yesterday, Meridian put its title insurance business on
the block. It's also looking to sell its $300 million
credit-card portfolio and about $300 million of its indirect
auto loan receivables.
   For the time being, Meridian is holding to some of its
other non-banking operations, such as mortgage lending, asset
management, trust services, merchant banking and securities
brokerage. These operations had been reorganized into a
financial services group earlier this year.
   Meridian's management "decided it was time to bite the
bullet," said David Penn at Legg Mason Inc. "But it's not one
of the disaster cases. {Meridian} has capital and liquidity,
which is what the regulators are looking for."
   Meridian said the additional $75 million in reserves was
needed because certain loans in its commercial and
real-estate portfolios continued to weaken during the summer.
Nonperforming assets are expected to increase to about $135
million at the end of third quarter from $107.6 million at
June 30. Less than one-third of the nonperforming loans are
tied to real estate.
   Mr. McCullough stressed that the reserve addition wasn't
mandated by federal or state regulators, who concluded a
review of the bank's books during the second quarter.
   The bank said it would maintain its current 30-cent
quarterly dividend. Unless the sale of the credit card
portfolio and auto loans closes before year end, the bank
wouldn't earn enough to cover the payout, Mr. McCullough
said.
   Meridian estimated a third-quarter per-share loss of 86
cents to 96 cents. In the 1989 third quarter, the bank earned
$22.5 million, or 56 cents a share.
   The company's shares closed yesterday at $11.75, off
$1.50, in national over-the-counter trading.

   And Mutant Turtles
   Sound Like Surfers

   MALIBU, Calif. -- Thanks in part to the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles, surfspeak is washing across the nation like a
stoked tsunami. That's like, you know, a totally awesome
wave.
   Surfspeak derives largely from Standard English and is
very closely related to Californian. In fact, it has become a
sort of classical language, by Malibu standards, dating all
the way back to the ancient 1960s, when the Beach Boys were
really boys and Ventures was a rock band instead of things
that capitalists finance. Surfspeak has occasionally basked
in national favor and seems to have inspired much of what is
known as Valley Girl talk, thus extending its influence over
young people around the country.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now the language is beginning to receive scholarly
attention -- mainly from Trevor "Coconut" Cralle, 29 years
old, who may be the world's leading authority on it. In the
six years since he graduated with a degree in cultural
geography from the University of California at Berkeley, Mr.
Cralle has combed almost every known surfing spot on the West
Coast, Hawaii and Australia in search of the perfect wave and
the most esoteric slang.
   Mr. Cralle, who works as a writer-researcher for the
California Coastal Commission, has compiled his research into
a thick manuscript, "The Surfin'ary: A Dictionary of Surfing
Terms and Phrases," and is shopping it around to publishers.
"A lot of empirical research has gone into this," says Mr.
Cralle, who abandons his easygoing surfer-dude manner and
adopts an intense professorial tone when talking about his
book.
   Mr. Cralle has his own research methods. He goes surfing
and interviews his subjects between catching waves. "It's a
good way to get their confidence." he says. "They know I'm
not just some goob from the Valley" -- that is, the sprawling
San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. He also has
scrupulously culled every new slang word he can find from
articles in magazines, books and newspapers, and has
conducted interviews in surf shops.
   The Surfin'ary is designed to preserve and document a rich
subculture, Mr. Cralle says. But it may also have great
appeal for surfing wannabes or poser hodads or nons
(non-surfers) who want to sound like surfers while avoiding
sunburn and salt water and who have never tried to toe up on
a stick (to surf). Even people who don't know the difference
between a goofy foot (their left) and a natural (their right)
can talk like thrashers (surfing showoffs).
   Many of the Surfin'ary entries describe waves, women,
surfboards and geeks (originally, carnival side-show freaks
who bit the heads off live chickens) who can't surf. There
are also terms for less glamorous aspects of the beach-party
life style. Vomiting, for example, is "talking to the seals."
   Some terms have a religious cast. A great ride can be like
"going to church" or visiting "in the Pope's living room." A
great wave or an attractive woman can be "just like death."
   Mr. Cralle endeavors to catalog every usage, no matter how
obscure. Gremmies (short for gremlins) are either "trainee
surf mongrels on their way to full surf Nazi status" or
"selfish undesirable pest(s)" who are constantly causing
trouble for other surfers.
   Mr. Cralle defines hodad as "a surfer who rarely goes into
the water but still talks, acts and dresses as if he were a
minor god of the sport," or "a greasy hot rodder with long
hair and sideburns . . . an ill-mannered beach bum who
doesn't surf . . . generally anyone surfers don't like."
   Some Malibu surfspeak seems to have seeped through Topanga
Canyon to the San Fernando Valley to become Valley Girl talk,
popularized in 1982 by rock musician Frank Zappa and his
daughter, Moon Unit. "The Vals thought words like `gnarly,'
`rad' and `tubular' were cool, so they took them home," Mr.
Cralle says. All three words are strongly approbative
adjectives.
   The slang was exported to the rest of the world by
television, movies and records. Writers for the TV shows and
movies mostly live near the beach and they write down what
they hear, says Albert Lewin, a screenwriter who co-authored
the "The Thesaurus of Slang" with his wife, Esther.
   Music groups such as Surf Punks and The Surf MCs also have
spread the slang. Surf Punks, a Los Angeles band, includes a
glossary with every album. The Surf MCs, from Berkeley,
combines elements of rap and punk; the group's anthem is
"Surf or Die."
   Some words and expressions have moved the other way, from
the media into surfspeak. A male dweeb is often called a
"Fred" or a "Barney" and a female dweeb is "Wilma," after the
Flintstone characters. The Flintstones also have given
surfing "Yabbadabba doo]" an exclamation of exhilaration akin
to "Cowabunga]"
   Surfspeak keeps changing as it loses expressions to Valley
Girl and other forms of slang. Language helps true surfers
"identify the geeks," says Rick "Rocking Fig" Fugnetti, who
produces a surf report for a Los Angeles radio station. "But
once the Vals pick it up the lingo has to change."
   Says Erin Martin, a 17-year-old resident of Newport Beach:
"These Val guys are totally gross. They think they're real,
but you can tell they're Barneys." She says "dweeby types"
often "snog right up" to her when she's wearing her "floss,"
or thong-backed bikini.
   Robert L. Chapman, a retired professor at Drew University
and author of a dictionary of American slang, says that
"Southern California is the richest place for new slang,"
though much of it is ephemeral, lacking "the staying power of
black slang," for example. Surfspeak, says Prof. Chapman, is
like a skyrocket. "It goes up with a big noise, explodes in a
very colorful way and then poof, it dies."
   Yet a few terms, such as "gremmie," and "hodad" -- have
survived for more than a generation. "Hang 10" -- to curl
one's toes over the end of a surfboard -- is still used, but
not by most surfers; the boards they ride today are too short
to permit the stunt without the surfer losing balance.
   "Cowabunga]" is another old word. It began as the greeting
that Buffalo Bob and Chief Thunderthud exchanged in the
popular 1950s television program for children, "Howdy Doody,"
and was picked up as an exclamation by surfers, says Mr.
Cralle. It spread to the nation through the "Gidget" surfer
movies and, later the "Peanuts" comic strip. Now the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles have adopted it as their war cry and
enhanced its popularity.
   But surfers still use it, too. "Cowabunga -- it's a pretty
good word. It's powerful and enduring," Mr. Cralle says.
Certainly, he adds, "it'll outlast the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles."

   Mutual Funds:
   Fidelity Tries
   To Revitalize
   Its Junk Fund

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)
</IN>
<LP>
   Junk-bond funds may never be the same.
   In a move that is likely to be copied by other mutual fund
groups, Boston's Fidelity Investments is changing the
investment objective of its big, battered junk-bond fund, the
$1.1 billion Fidelity High Income Fund.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The fund's shareholders will get to vote on the change in
December. "The fund right now is oriented towards income,"
says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president. "The proposal
is to change the fund's objective to both income and capital
appreciation."
   Fidelity's proposal to change the investment objective of
its high-yield fund is the most radical attempt yet to stem
the exodus of shareholders from sagging junk funds. Under the
proposal, 65% of Fidelity High Income's assets would be
invested in junk bonds. But the other 35% would be invested
for capital appreciation, through the purchase of securities
such as bonds of bankrupt companies, zero-coupon bonds and
high-yielding stocks. The fund would be renamed Fidelity
Capital Income.
   The move by Fidelity High Income may presage changes at
other funds, says Lori Lucas, a fund analyst with Morningstar
Inc., a Chicago mutual fund research firm. "Everybody's
trying to change a vehicle that's no longer popular with the
general public," says Ms. Lucas, who reckons some funds may
follow the Fidelity route, seeking to shore up their share
price by pursuing capital appreciation.
   Other funds, she says, may take a different tack. "A lot
of these funds are going to become more general corporate
bond funds," she says.
   Ever since the junk-bond market fell apart last year,
junk-bond fund managers have been scrambling to shore up
their falling fund share prices. Many junk-bond fund managers
have been raising the quality of the bonds in their
portfolios. According to Ms. Lucas, AIM High Yield, American
Capital High Yield, Bull &amp; Bear High Yield and Phoenix High
Yield have all been upgrading the credit quality of the bonds
they hold.
   But William Veronda, manager of Financial Bond Shares-High
Yield, reckons a lack of enough good-quality, high-yield
bonds like Duracell Holdings Corp., Kroger Co. and First
Brands Corp. will force some of the larger junk-bond funds to
either buy investment-grade corporate bonds or dabble in
distressed bond issues.
   Even Mr. Veronda's fund, which is relatively small at $40
million in assets, has been affected. "We're padding our fund
with some high-grade bonds," says Mr. Veronda, though he
notes that the fund is still 90% invested in junk.
   However, Paul Suckow, director of fixed income at
Oppenheimer Management Corp., reckons that right now fund
managers should be buying into the high-yield sector, not
selling out. In 1988, the $600-million Oppenheimer High Yield
Fund moved a quarter of its assets into investment-grade
bonds. "We continued to hold that position in 1989, and only
recently have we lowered that percentage as we find
opportunities in the high-yield market," says Mr. Suckow.
"The people who are {moving into better-quality bonds} now
are too late. They should have done it two years ago."
   Fidelity's junk-bond fund, like its competitors',
continues to boast double-digit dividend yields. But over the
past year, those dividends have failed to compensate for
falling junk-bond prices. Fidelity High Income, one of the
largest junk-bond funds, is down 8.2% in the year ended Aug.
31, slightly worse than the average junk-bond fund tracked by
New York's Lipper Analytical Services.
   Fidelity High Income's assets have shrunk to $1.1 billion
from a peak of $2 billion in 1989, the result of declining
junk-bond prices and redemptions by unhappy investors. Other
funds, too, have been affected. According to the Investment
Company Institute, junk-fund assets stood at $26 billion at
the end of July, down from almost $35 billion a year earlier.
   Fidelity has "had a lot of disgruntled shareholders, just
like other fund groups," notes Eric Kobren, editor of
Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter on Fidelity based
in Wellesley, Mass. "People were yield chasers, and they paid
the price."
   On Tuesday, Fidelity closed the High Income Fund to new
investors until the December vote, though existing investors
can both add to their accounts and make redemptions.
Fidelity's Mr. Litvack says the fund was closed so that "the
people who have weathered the ups and downs of the fund over
the last few years" will be the ones to decide the fund's
fate.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission is shaking up the
world of accounting.
   The overhaul, so far, is a sedate one in a notoriously
sedate field. But it could radically change companies'
financial reports, and so the way companies are evaluated by
investors. Even small variations in accounting can translate
into big changes in stock prices, and some of the
contemplated rule changes aren't small.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This isn't evolutionary, it's revolutionary," comments
Christopher J. Steffen, chief financial officer at Honeywell
Inc.
   Right now, the SEC is focusing solely on debt securities
and certain types of loans held by banks and other financial
institutions. Next to be affected will probably be other
companies with significant financial assets. Finally, much of
corporate America, ranging from General Motors to a Silicon
Valley start-up, may feel pressure to revise the way it
accounts for assets.
   Although no one is suggesting that the SEC will revamp
financial statements altogether, it wants to force companies
to go a long way toward putting up-to-date values on assets
currently on their books at historical cost -- the original
purchase price. It has launched a campaign in Congress and
with the accounting profession to get fast action.
   "If accounting standards aren't adequate to give an
accurate picture of a firm's condition, they're not doing the
job they need to do," says SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden.
   The agency's focus on accounting is another indication of
its renewed scrutiny of corporate America, and its shift away
from targeting Wall Street stock-trading abuses. The SEC
recently adopted rules making it easier for companies to sell
debt directly to large institutions and is awaiting
congressional approval to toughen enforcement against
wrongdoing by corporate officials.
   Sweeping changes in corporate accounting won't come
easily. Many companies oppose, and are lobbying against, any
change that could raise costs, skew numbers or reduce
reported profits. Banks especially are leery of any change
that could make their balance sheets look worse. And SEC
officials themselves are wary of doing anything that might
make U.S. companies less competitive with foreign rivals, or
trigger, through accounting advantages, foreign takeovers of
U.S. companies.
   The SEC's chiefs aren't unanimous about how far they want
to go. "I'd be happy just to have small changes," says
Commissioner Philip Lochner Jr., who heads the agency's
accounting project. But Mr. Breeden, who increasingly
dominates the commission, seems determined to go forward with
significant changes.
   Although most of this work of revision has been going on
behind closed doors, Mr. Breeden recently went public with
his first target. Testifying before the Senate Banking
Committee, he said he wants to force banks and other
financial companies to alter the way they account for bonds
and other securities held for investment.
   Under federal law, the SEC has the mandate to determine
accounting principles for publicly traded companies. But it
has generally ceded that authority to private-sector
accounting bodies such as the Financial Accounting Standards
Board.
   Should the SEC decide to change the rules, it has a lot of
weapons at its disposal besides just pressuring accounting
bodies. For example, it has the power simply to change
accounting rules by voting a rule proposal at an open
meeting. After a period for public comment, the commission
could pass a final rule. Alternatively, the agency can issue
interpretative releases, telling public companies and the
accounting industry how it reads a specific rule and that
they should abide by that reading.
   Under today's standards, financial companies -- banks,
thrifts and insurance concerns -- holding stacks of
investment securities can make their own judgments on whether
to use historical accounting or current, "market" standards.
"Financial-institution balance sheets should have the words
`once upon a time' on top of them," Mr. Breeden says
scornfully. "They are a statement of history." Under the SEC
plan, recently rejected by an industry accounting panel, only
current values of a financial company's securities would be
listed on the balance sheet and reflected in quarterly
profit-and-loss statements.
   Some financial concerns already are sharpening their
pencils to current accounting and stepping away from
historical levels. Rouse Co., a real-estate developer based
in Columbia, Md., which began the switch in 1976, shows the
differences on the balance sheet in its annual report. At
year-end 1989, for example, the company's assets, largely
land and buildings, totaled $4.13 billion, nearly $2 billion
more than the assets would reflect on a cost basis. (The
company does the same on the liabilities side of the ledger.)
   "Initially, it came about as a result of the SEC
requesting that companies do replacement cost accounting,"
says David Tripp, Rouse's director of investor relations.
Rather than trying to estimate what it would cost to build a
new project, Rouse values its assets on what it would cost to
replace the income stream from them.
   Not surprisingly, Mr. Tripp notes, the company's stock has
tended to trade much closer to the value achieved by the
current-cost model. At the end of 1989, based on historical
cost, Rouse had shareholder equity of $52.9 million, or
roughly $1.11 a share, Mr. Tripp says. But under the
current-value model, shareholder equity was $1.73 billion, or
about $34.80 a share. Only recently, with the real-estate
slump, has the stock been trading at a deep discount to
current value, Mr. Tripp says.
   But James W. Otto, chief financial officer of Ameritrust
Corp., a Cleveland-based banking company, says marking assets
to current value "would be a very significant and costly
effort that wouldn't be useful. . . . It's an estimation of
the liquidation value of a company that is totally irrelevant
to a going concern."
   Moreover, Mr. Otto adds, "A majority of the assets and
liabilities don't have a ready market." Therefore, he argues,
"some very subjective assumptions" would be needed to arrive
at current values for those assets and liabilities.
   At the root of SEC's new zeal are lessons drawn from the
thrift crisis. Mr. Breeden cites 1978 numbers that show the
thrift industry with a positive net worth. But a harder look
-- using current instead of historical accounting -- shows
that the industry was already ailing, with a negative net
worth of as much as $118 billion.
   The SEC worries that the banking industry could slip into
a similar situation, with trouble disguised by accounting
anomalies. Many accounting-industry officials agree. "We need
to get accounting changes that reflect what has happened,"
says Arthur R. Wyatt, a principal of Arthur Andersen and the
head of the International Accounting Standards Committee.
"It's real, and it should be reported."
   The banking industry itself thinks that the SEC's push is
off-base. "You wouldn't want anything that would cause
portfolio managers to make business decisions based on
accounting rather than economic impacts," contends Roger
Trupin, a Citicorp representative to the big-business
accounting task force. And Dennis R. Beresford, FASB
chairman, adds that banks ask why they should have to mark
their assets at current prices without manufacturers having
to do that with inventories.
   In the past few weeks, the SEC's mission has taken on a
new urgency. Accounting rule makers who pride themselves on
the stately pace of the standard-setting process are shocked
by what they see as a government-inspired stampede. SEC
staffers are calling up the standard setters, who are
accustomed to taking months and years to deliberate on a
single issue, and demanding results now. And in a striking
departure, the SEC is not only dictating the timetable but
also letting rule makers know what answers it wants.
   Although the commission traditionally has relied heavily
on the private sector to write accounting standards, the FASB
often has been chided by business for taking too long to make
rules and for making them too complicated. Indeed, the FASB
is still working on a project, begun in 1986, on how to
handle financial instruments.
   "I don't think {Mr. Breeden} has to jam through" more
current accounting standards, says Pat McConnell, a Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. managing director who heads an analysts'
accounting panel. "The FASB is scared to death."
   Observers cite the way the SEC handled an
accounting-standards group's vote on the bank-debt question.
Just minutes before the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee was to debate the proposal, it was given a copy of
Mr. Breeden's previously delivered Senate testimony by an SEC
staffer -- a none-too-subtle reminder of the agency's stance.
Then, the day of the vote, the committee got a letter from
Edmund Coulson, the SEC's chief accountant, decrying
newspaper reports that the panel planned to soften proposed
tough new standards in the face of industry pressure.
   Still, the committee voted to introduce standards less
restrictive than the SEC wanted. Stepping up the pressure,
Mr. Breeden and Mr. Coulson have set up a meeting with the
panel's chairman, the FASB and others next Tuesday. Although
the SEC isn't assured of victory, tougher standards for banks
seem in the cards.
   That has the rest of corporate America wondering whether
it's next. One prominent corporate treasurer, Chrysler
Corp.'s Frederick Zuckerman, thinks that major companies
wouldn't have much problem switching accounting of liquid
assets to a current, market measure. "We all know what our
assets are worth," he says. But, he adds, trying to determine
the value of, say, inventory "is a bag of snakes."
   John Robbins, a managing partner at accounting firm
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., says, "You can do it on debt, you
can do it on something that trades. But what's the value of a
widget plant?"
   A major advantage of historical-cost accounting, he
argues, is that value is determined by competing interests --
a buyer and a seller agreeing on a price. Relying on a
company's current valuation requires appraisals. "There's
only one danger with doing an appraisal: Believing it," he
says. The wild real-estate appraisals emerging from the
devastated thrift industry have increased that anxiety.
   But that hasn't stopped some companies from relying more
heavily on internal systems of current accounting. "We may
not be accurate in our current cost estimates," says David G.
Harmer, FMC Corp.'s comptroller, "but we're a hell of a lot
closer than erroneous historical-cost basis. We know {those}
are understated."
   The Chicago-based industrial conglomerate could end up
working as a model for future accounting rules. It unveiled a
cost-based accounting system in the early 1980s, when its
managers wanted a better gauge of how their various
businesses -- defense equipment, food machinery, agricultural
chemicals, petroleum equipment -- were performing. FMC's
managers struggled to decide where to invest resources.
   As division managers worried about being held to unfairly
high standards, FMC set about valuing all the assets in its
units, using appraisals where necessary. Corporate computer
people rejiggered FMC's internal accounting so that the value
of plant and equipment could be updated by inflation indexes.
(It permits financial officials to strip out current costs to
get historical numbers for SEC-required data.)
   "It helps you focus on what your real performance is," Mr.
Harmer says.
   There's a bonus, too. Division managers are more likely to
update obsolete equipment with more efficient technology if
they know that the old equipment's value will be subtracted
from the totals under current accounting methods. Historical
measures would value the old equipment at zero, encouraging
executives to keep it.
   Mr. Harmer cites a metal-fabrication press, which bends
and shapes metal. To determine the replacement cost of a
press bought in 1982 for $522,000, the company would add 19%
-- the change in the wholesale price index over the seven
years -- to arrive at a replacement cost of $621,000. Since
the company assumes that the press has a 12-year life, it
then would deduct depreciation from both numbers, putting the
replacement value at $257,000. That's still 19% higher than
what accounting rules force the company to show on its books.
   "That's our starting point," Mr. Harmer says. "If managers
think the value is way off, they can challenge it."
   Real-estate values are determined by appraisals every two
to three years.
   Although FMC's numbers are more accurate, they also show
why many companies oppose the plan: FMC estimates that 1989
operating profit (before interest expense and taxes),
reported at $347 million, would have been 10% to 15% lower
using current-cost accounting.
   For other companies, the effects would vary. Many
capital-intensive, smokestack industries, such as autos,
steel or machine tools, would post sharply lower results, Mr.
Harmer suggests. But the impact would be substantially less
for high-tech companies and service concerns without a lot of
old plant and equipment.
   Mr. Harmer acknowledges that the current-cost accounting
is no panacea. Intangibles such as good will and training
pose insurmountable problems; the company uses standard
historical accounting for them.
   The SEC's Mr. Lochner sees that as just one stumbling
block. "What is the current value of Coca-Cola's trademarks?
Your guess is as good as theirs," he says. "But we all know
it's worth more than the $1 or so it's carried for on Coke's
books." (Actually, it's on the books at zero.)
   The SEC has been down this road before. John C. Burton, a
Columbia professor and former SEC chief accountant, recalls
that in 1974, when bank portfolios "were very much under
water," the Accounting Standards Executive Committee was
ready to shift those holdings to current prices. Mr. Burton
says he lined up the five commissioners to vote for the plan.
   Arthur Burns, then the Federal Reserve chairman, called
Mr. Burton to a special meeting to discuss the plan -- on
Christmas Eve. The Fed chief praised Mr. Burton, his former
student, as an accounting theorist. Then he informed Mr.
Burton that he "should advise the commissioners that they
were taking a grave risk with the economic future of the U.S.
in the interest of a somewhat dubious accounting principle."
   The next day, the commissioners withdrew their support for
the plan.

   TOKYO -- Sales at Japan's department stores and other
major retail stores in August rose 7.9% to 1.525 trillion yen
($11.15 billion) from a year earlier, the government said.
   The August growth followed a 9% year-to-year increase
posted in July. Though the pace of growth slowed, compared
with the second quarter, in which retail sales grew between
10% and 16%, "Retail sales are on a steady upward trend," an
official said. The pace of growth usually slows in August
because of seasonal factors.

   ST. LOUIS -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. said it decided to

million theme park and resort in Spain, but "only with the
equity involvement of international developers or partners."
   The brewing concern said last year it planned to build the
park, on Spain's Costa Brava, on its own. But earlier this
year, it said the plans had been placed "on hold," after
problems arose with municipal officials in the region.
Anheuser said yesterday that "progress has been made toward
an agreement" between the company and the two municipalities.

   In Madrid, Javier de la Rosa, best known in Spain for his
links with the Kuwait Investment Office, said he has offered
to lead a group of investors taking an 80% stake in a revised
project valued at 40 billion pesetas ($406.1 million). He
said through a spokesman that final details haven't been
settled, but that the plan is for Anheuser to remain in the
project with a 20% stake and act as a technical adviser. An
adviser to the Kuwait Investment Office and partner in its
Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras S.A., Mr. de la Rosa
controls 55% of the Barcelona amusement park known as
Tibidabo.
   An Anheuser spokesman said: "We haven't signed a
definitive partnership agreement with anyone. We have held
preliminary discussions with interested parties, and, as a
matter of corporate policy, we can't comment on any ongoing
discussions with any party."
   Anheuser said its total investment to date in the project
is $90 million, of which $50 million is in land. To complete
the site acquisition, the company said, could require an
additional $30 million.
   Under the initial plan, Anheuser envisioned spending an
additional $275 million in a possible second phase that would
begin after the turn of the century.

   Can Asian Games Wipe Out the Stain of Tiananmen?

   Beijing -- Among the myriad souvenirs of the 11th Asian
Games on sale here are pins showing the jolly panda Panpan
playing Asiad sports. As he moves, Panpan's eyes flash with a
battery-fed red light. Panpan rows, Panpan plays baseball --
and Panpan the sharpshooter wields a rifle. This makes
Beijing residents gasp at what they suppose is a Hong
Kong-produced satire: Panpan as a People's Liberation Army
soldier whose eyes, as the Chinese expression goes, "have
turned red with killing."
   Live pandas, however, seem to share the Beijing public's
generally dim view of the Asian Games, which opened Saturday
and run through Oct. 7. Several months ago, pop singer Hu Yue
sang the official Asian Games tune, "Raise High the Torch of
the Asiad," in the panda cage at Tianjin Zoo. As Ms. Hu
crooned on live television, China's cuddliest creature, who'd
been lying decoratively in the background, rolled almost
imperceptibly forward and sank its fangs into the singer's
leg. The song dissolved in a shriek and the broadcast was
abruptly cut. The Chinese leadership, which is staking more
than half a billion dollars and an incalculable amount of
face on the 16-day spectacle, isn't about to let some
bamboo-muncher spoil the show.

   China has been planning for the Asiad since winning the
bid for the Games in 1986. If all goes well during the Games,
Beijing figures it has a fighting chance of hosting the
Olympics in 2000, a gold-medal event in international
prestige. Since June 4 last year, the preparations have taken
on a fresh urgency. The leadership sees the Asiad as a chance
to undo some of the damage it inflicted on China's image when
it ordered the tanks into Tiananmen Square.
   As a public relations exercise, the Games are aimed at the
right target. Despite ideological differences, Asian
countries -- some of which are in no position to chastise
China on human-rights issues -- have made far fewer official
noises over the violent suppression of the 1989 protest
movement than the West. Despite initial rumblings last year,
not one of the 38 countries invited has boycotted the Games,
though the Olympic Council of Asia voted to exclude Iraq
because of its invasion of Kuwait. (Several American
publications reported that Jordan isn't participating, but
China's Xinhua News Agency could not confirm this.) South
Korea, which does not have diplomatic relations with China,
sent advisers to help work out the logistics. Even Taiwan,
which arguably has more reason to boycott the Games than
anyone else, is participating, sending more than 400 athletes
as its largest overseas athletic delegation ever.
   Beijing has been given a major facelift for the event. In
August, road workers finished resurfacing Changan Avenue to
obliterate the tank treads from last year's violence. In
keeping with the avenue's new look, only vehicles officially
deemed attractive are allowed to cruise along it; Jeeps and
two-seaters have been banned as too downmarket for Beijing's
premier boulevard.
   According to one of the half-dozen books of Asian Games
trivia available here, 2.31 million workers toiled to plant
500,000 trees and 200,000 flowers, and lay down 480,000
square yards of lawn in the new Asian Games Village and
around the stadiums of the northern suburbs alone. They also
cultivated an additional 1.89 million trees, 700,000 flowers
and 2.4 million square yards of lawn in the eight other key
districts.
   Workers also applied fresh paint to buildings and walls
along major arteries in the capital as well as those close to
competition sites. New walls hide homes too ramshackle for
fresh paint to improve.
   Where it's possible that athletes or visitors might stray
into residential buildings, they've been given a touch of
interior redecoration. In one apartment block, workers
spray-painted the entire stairwell white -- including the
windows, the floor and a few bicycles that happened to be
chained to the railings. Foreigners call the result a
Potemkin City. The Chinese expression is earthier: "donkey
turds," meaning something that's shiny on the outside but you
know what in the middle.
   If the people of Beijing do not seem impressed with all
the construction and planting, perhaps that's because they
have to pay for it. Having been told that China's economy is
not doing as well as hoped and that they will have to tighten
their belts, they are not amused that they have been forced
to buy Asiad bonds to help foot the Games' $530 million bill.
   They also have had to put up with a whole slew of
campaigns to beautify the human environment. Parents are
forbidden to carry their children on bicycle handlebars.
Squadrons of citizens have been pressed into "volunteer"
service as traffic controllers, and stiff fines are forcing
Mad Max bicyclists into line. Even toilet attendants have a
mission: Enforce the rule that no more than six mosquitoes
inhabit any public toilet. Police are empowered to fine not
only spitters and litterers but also shop attendants who
don't wear ties. Beijing's surly waiters have been instructed
to be friendly, an order that that does not appear to have
had much effect.
   As an additional measure of preventive social medicine,
mental patients and neighborhood bullies have been put safely
under lock and key. Itinerant provincials have been rounded
up and sent home. The Beijing Housing Service Corporation for
Diplomatic Missions also has put in its oar, issuing
directives asking foreign residents to put their cigarette
stubs in ashtrays, lock their doors when going out and watch
that their children do not play with fire.
   Drivers of the more than 2,500 vehicles commandeered for
official use during the Games had to take special classes in
such subjects as traffic safety and foreign languages. One
taxi driver assigned to the Games happily demonstrated his
method for mastering the latter: "How do you do?" is
remembered as "rats' stomachs have poison" (haodu youdu).
That, he explained, is how you greet people in Japanese.
   The authorities hope that as many as 200,000 tourists will
visit Beijing during the Games. Once they've got them, they
are hitting them up. The Far Eastern Economic Review
estimated that taxi fares would rise almost 70% during the
Games, while already pricey hotel tariffs would rise 35%.
Tourists might feel ripped off, but they should be safe. A
massive anti-crime campaign was launched earlier in the year.
According to Liu Fuzhu, head of the Supreme People's
Procurate, there were 210,000 arrests nationwide between
January and May, a large increase over last year. The law and
order campaign intensified over the summer; Amnesty
International noted with concern that "secret executions have
been extensive."
   The unusually wet summer weather has prompted speculation
that Beijing will be rocked by an earthquake during the
Games, a possibility officially denied in late August by Li
Qinghua, spokesman for the State Seismological Bureau. With
breezy confidence, Mr. Li assured Beijing residents that not
only would no earthquake strike, but that the weather during
the Games would be the finest of the whole year.
   The weather may be the least of the authorities' worries.
They seem to fear that the citizens of Beijing will try to
take their revenge for the massacre of 1989 on the Games of
1990, particularly since the Communist Party has so obviously
staked its prestige on the Asiad. The head of the Chinese
Asian Games committee is, after all, Mayor Chen Xitong,
widely identified with the violent suppression of the 1989
protest movement and subsequent purges. The word in Beijing
is that the workplaces responsible for the distribution of
tickets to the Games have to provide the police with the name
of each person given a ticket together with his or her seat
number. Even the holders of the 200,000 passes issued to
workers, athletes, guests and so on are subject to security
checks each time they enter one of the Games' sites.
   Security measures can prevent sabotage, but not mockery.
"Do you know what `Panpan' {literally `hope hope'} stands
for?" asks one typically cynical Beijing resident. "They hope
the foreigners come, and they hope they bring lots of money
with them."
   Which brings us to another Beijing joke: "What's the
spirit of the Asian Games? Live for today, for there will be
no tomorrow."

   Call it chemical attack, call it one of the biggest drug
deals in history. Both are true. On Sept. 13, Philip Morris
announced that it will supply the Soviet Union with more than
20 billion cigarettes by the end of 1991. A company news
release proudly described it as "the largest single export
order in the company's history." RJR Nabisco will send a
further 14 billion. After the first 20 billion cigarettes
from Philip Morris, the company will continue to supply
"significant quantities of cigarettes" between 1992 and 1995,
also technical assistance to help modernized Soviet cigarette
factories.
   Philip Morris declines to put a value on its share of the
drug deal. Robert Kaplan, a spokesman for the company,
refused to name a figure to my colleague Richard McKerrow,
though he did volunteer that "it's a very nice deal for us.
It firmly establishes us in the Soviet Union and Russian
Republic and gets us into the East European fold in a way we
haven't been before." The company has been selling in
hard-currency and duty-free Russian shops for 20 years but
never before have Marlboros and kindred brands been available
to local citizens. Asked about the ethics of encouraging
smoking in the Soviet Union, Mr. Kaplan said, "We're
answering a call for help, something we're quite happy to do.
We have a position that adults have a right to make decisions
about the risks of smoking."

   The U.S. shipments replace a shortfall in domestically
produced cigarettes in the Soviet Union, and in the estimate
(which he calls conservative) of Dr. John Seffrin, chairman
of the National Board of Directors of the American Cancer
Society, the 7,000 Russians who would have been killed by the
home product will now perish from the substitute U.S.
imports. More grimly, Dr. Richard Peto, director of Oxford
Unversity's Cancer Studies Unit, believes that "after the
full death rates from smoking appear in a country, then, for
every 34 billion cigarettes, about 34,000 will be killed by
their habit." Soviet youths find American commodities chic
and will no doubt delight in puffing their Marlboros during
the three-hour wait in line at the Moscow McDonalds. Dr.
Seffrin believes that the Morris/R.J. Reynolds sale "could
end up in the addiction of countless millions of children who
don't now smoke."
   The consequences of tobacco addiction in the Soviet Union
are already very bad. Out of a population of about 300
million there are 120 million smokers, according to Dr. David
Zaridze, vice director of All Union Cancer Research Center in
Moscow, who is attending a conference with Dr. Peto in
Oxford. Dr. Peto says that "if you look at the pattern of
deaths, smoking is having a larger impact in the Soviet Union
than in many other places." He estimates that roughly 30% of
all deaths in the U.S.S.R. in 1987 of people between ages 35
and 59 resulted from tobacco. In Mikhail Gorbachev's age
range -- 55 to 64 -- the male lung-cancer rate in Russia is
now about 25% higher than in the U.S.
   Bad though the situation is, Dr. Zaridze says there is
"room for things to get worse," and that sales by U.S.
tobacco companies "will not be helpful in fighting smoking in
the Soviet Union. Smoking an American cigarette is still a
positive image in the Soviet Union."
   The surge in tobacco-induced deaths in the Soviet Union
will be mirrored elsewhere in the world. Dr. Peto calculates
that if current trends continue, the number of these
tobacco-induced deaths world-wide will rise from a rate today
of 2.5 million a year to 10 million a year in the 2020s. This
past April, a consultative group mustered by the World Health
Organization and chaired by Dr. Peto reported that of these
prospective 10 million annual deaths, about seven million
will be in the developing world. This rate of 10 million
estimated for the second quarter of the 21st century means,
according to Dr. Peto, that "over 200 million of today's
children and teenagers will eventually be killed by tobacco."
   Faced with a decline in tobacco addiction in developed
countries (down 9% in the U.S. and 25% in the U.K. between
1970 and 1985, according to the British medical journal The
Lancet) giant cigarette cartels are targeting the Third
World, using their advertising clout and political muscle to
carve open new markets in such countries as Japan, Taiwan and
South Korea. In South Korea, smoking rates among teenage
girls quadrupled (1.6% to 8.7%) and among teen-age boys
nearly doubled (18% to 30%) after the entry of U.S. brands.
   Today the U.S. government is actively persecuting Thailand
for its resistance to foreign cigarette imports, according to
the Bangkok Post, and is preparing a list of Thai products
that will be embargoed until Thailand opens its market to
U.S. cigarettes and, more importantly, permits advertising of
same. The U.S. Trade Representative has taken the tobacco
companies' case to GATT.
   So here we have the macabre absurdity of the U.S.
government on the one hand actively promoting the export of a
drug -- tobacco -- certain to cause millions of deaths, while
on the other waging war against another drug peril, puny in
comparison.
   For a whiff of the double standard, consider two newspaper
headlines: July 19, in the Asheville Citizen Times, "Quayle:
Open Up New World Markets for Tobacco"; Aug. 9, in the Los
Angeles Times, "Quayle Appeals to Peru for Help in War on
Drugs." The vice president told Peruvians that "an
anti-narcotics program is critical. It's a must . . . You are
losing your children . . . just like we are losing our
children." Three weeks earlier, Mr. Quayle was telling North
Carolinians that while "the American public as a whole is
smoking less. . . . We ought to think about the exports" and
that while "we're not going to back away from what public
health officials say . . . we're not going to deny a country
an export from our country because of that policy." In April,
James Mason, assistant secretary to the Department of Health
and Human Services, called it "unconscionable" for tobacco
companies to be "peddling their poison abroad." A month
later, the White House prevented him from testifying on the
Hill about the health consequences of U.S. tobacco exports.
   Since the Russians invited the cigarette shipments it's
probably technically imprecise to call these imports chemical
warfare. But the effects will be the same, and indeed the
5,000 Kurds dead in Saddam Hussein's onslaught did not have
to pay for the poisons that slaughtered them and the
catastrophe was brutally finite, rather than continuing to
kill people far into the next century, filling hospitals year
after year with the sick and the dying.
   So much for the crusade against drugs. As any cynical
narcotrafficante would no doubt be happy to point out, all
America is actually doing is consolidating its position as
the biggest dealer in addictive and lethal substances on the
planet, waging war on all rivals, whether they take the form
of the Thai domestic tobacco industry or the Colombian
cocaine cartels.

   MADRID -- Spain's merchandise trade deficit on a customs
basis widened 1.8% to 2.244 trillion pesetas ($22.78 billion)
in the first eight months from 2.205 trillion pesetas a year
earlier, the Customs Directorate said.
   In August, the trade gap narrowed 25% to 216.6 billion
pesetas from 290.1 billion pesetas a year earlier. The
directorate said an 11% drop in imports in August to 523.9
billion pesetas from 589.6 billion pesetas a year earlier
helped shrink the monthly deficit.

   Education:
   Private Colleges Temper
   Their Increases in Tuition

   Tuition increases at private colleges moderated to 8% from
9% a year ago, a development that analysts tied to slackened
demand and schools' worries over allegations that they charge
too much.
   The slower rate of increase was too modest to be hailed as
the beginning of a broad trend. Public-school increases of 7%
were unchanged from a year ago. But some educators say
government and economic pressures could help keep increases
modest in Ivy League and other top-tier schools in coming
years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The average four-year private college raised tuition to
$9,391 from $8,663 this school year, the New York-based
College Board said in its annual tuition survey. The
admissions and testing group said private room-and-board
prices climbed 7% to $4,153. Four-year public tuition rose to
$1,809 from $1,696 for in-state residents, with
room-and-board up 5% to $3,161.
   "I think schools are beginning to pay attention to what's
going on out there in terms of application declines and
public pressure about prices," said Arthur Hauptman, a
college consultant who specializes in educational finance.
   Although no overall figures are available yet, many
colleges reported application declines for this year of 5% to
10%. This year's tuitions were also the first that were set
after the U.S. Justice Department announced a price-fixing
inquiry of about 55 private schools in August 1989.
   "In part, colleges are reacting to the Justice Department
investigation," said Peter Roberts, president of the College
Savings Bank, in Princeton N.J.
   Mr. Roberts, whose bank markets investments indexed to
tuition increases, says that the 55 schools under
investigation raised their tuitions by an average of only
7.8%, while 445 other schools in his data base went up by
8.4%. The group of 55 includes the eight Ivy League schools,
Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and other schools with above-average prices.
   After inflation, analysts noted, private tuition rose only
3.2% this year vs. about 4.5% a year ago. Even with this
slowdown, some top institutions are still charging rates that
exceed many Americans' annual incomes.
   The College Board listed tuition, room and board charges
of $20,820 at Yale University, $20,655 at Harvard University,
$20,498 at Princeton University and $20,210 at Stanford
University. These schools say they have added to their own
financial aid awards to offset rising prices for lower-income
students.
   David Breneman, a visiting professor at Harvard and former
president of Kalamazoo College, said that while the Justice
Department inquiry continues, it will have a moderating
effect on future increases at top schools. He said increases
in the 1980s of four to five percentage points above
consumer-price rises were an "aberration" that will be
corrected by economic forces such as consumer resistance.
   Other analysts were split in their predictions. Mr.
Roberts, whose products' success depends in part on rising
tuitions, said he expects "a return to increases of about
twice the consumer price index" as government support for
private schools slackens in coming years.
   But Mr. Hauptman said he sees a recession ahead, meaning
sharper increases at state schools, which rely heavily on
public subsidies and would suffer the most from government
spending cuts. Private colleges, however, may implement more
moderate increases, Mr. Hauptman said, because "they are more
market sensitive and have historically held the line" in
economic downturns.

   Consumers Here Pay Twice
   As Much as Canadians
   For Same Service Level

   U.S. consumers pay doctors more than twice as much as
their Canadian neighbors do for the same amount of health
services, a new study says.
   But researchers found that the higher fees for U.S.
doctors don't translate to comparably higher incomes because
they have higher overhead costs and a lighter workload than
Canadian physicians do.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The study, in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
adds to an emerging body of research that questions whether
the U.S. gets its money's worth from the world's most
expensive health-care system. Last spring, researchers
reported that death rates in U.S. and Canadian hospitals were
similar for a variety of procedures while expenditures for
hospital care were 25% to 50% higher.
   The new study, by Victor Fuchs, a Stanford University
health economist, doesn't directly address quality of care.
But it does challenge some standard assumptions about
differences between the two systems. Advocates for
overhauling the U.S. health-care system consider Canada an
important model.
   "The study will be very influential in the health policy
debate," says Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton
University. "And {we} will have continued research that tries
to get at the question, what are Canadians actually missing?"
   Overall, U.S. health expenditures are 38% higher per
capita than in Canada, based on 1985 government and insurance
industry health-care data, the study says. The researchers
focused only on money spent for physician services --
including doctor visits, fees for tests and surgery, nursing
support, equipment and office supplies -- to make their
comparisons.
   They found that the U.S. spent $347 per capita on
physician services, while Canada spent $202. For medical
tests and surgical procedures, the U.S. spent $193 per
capita, 2.8 times higher than the Canadian figure of $69. The
difference in expenditures for office and hospital visits was
much smaller: $154 in the U.S. and $133 in Canada. Physician
fees for all services were 2.4 times higher -- and up to 4.5
times higher for some procedures -- in the U.S.
   A spokesman for the American Medical Association said the
doctors' group hadn't had time to evaluate the report. The
AMA has generally opposed adopting a Canadian-style system in
the U.S., saying, among other things, that it won't translate
well to the larger and more diverse U.S. population.
   The Canadian system, funded principally from taxes, caps
physician fees and establishes a health-care budget. This
results in waiting lines for many elective procedures that
critics say amounts to rationing or restricting care.
   The study found that U.S. citizens get only about
three-quarters the amount of services per capita that
Canadians do -- a "striking refutation of the hypothesis that
lower spending in Canada is achieved by providing fewer
services," Mr. Fuchs, and a colleague, James S. Hahn, say in
their study.
   Canadian physicians provide about 1.5 times more patient
evaluation and management services -- such as physicals and
other routine care -- than U.S. doctors. This reflects the
fact that Canada has a much higher proportion of general
practitioners over specialists than the U.S., and that
Canadians are fully insured. More than 31 million Americans
lack health insurance and millions of others lack coverage
for primary care. Canadian specialists have a heavier
workload as well: The researchers estimated there are about
40% more "procedure-oriented physicians" in the U.S., but
that Canadians do about 20% more procedures per capita.
   Mr. Fuchs said that after adjusting for differences in
specialties, net income of U.S. doctors was 35% higher than
their colleagues in Canada, which he said accounted for only
a relatively "small portion" of higher physician fees.
Overhead for billing, a more cumbersome process in the U.S.
with dozens of private and public third-party payers, as well
as nursing staff, malpractice insurance and other
administrative costs also help explain why U.S. residents get
fewer services per dollar than Canadians.
   General practitioners and family physicians deliver
two-thirds of routine care in Canada, while internists,
pediatricians, psychiatrists and other specialists deliver
the rest. "In the U.S. the proportions are reversed," the
authors say. Whether this difference in "intensity of care"
means a difference in quality isn't clear.
   The researchers analyzed data for both nations for 1985. A
smaller sample, comparing Iowa and Manitoba, as well as an
update using 1987 data turned up some variations in
statistics, but confirmed the broader trends.

   To Derail Merger Plan

   Bear Stearns Cos. and other Wall Street takeover-stock
speculators are trying to use an obscure provision of
Delaware law to derail the proposed merger of insurance
brokers Corroon &amp; Black Corp. and Willis Faber PLC of London.
   The takeover-stock speculators, known as arbitragers, are
upset because Corroon &amp; Black rejected a $40-a-share cash
offer from Aon Corp. and intends to complete a stock-swap
merger with Willis Faber that currently is valued at about
$30.64 a share, or about $628.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "What they've done is wrong," says Robert Steinberg, a
senior managing director of Bear Stearns and co-head of its
arbitrage operation, referring to Corroon's rejection of the
Aon offer. "It's a terrible precedent," says Mr. Steinberg.
   But rather than simply selling the Corroon shares that
Bear Stearns owns, an approach Mr. Steinberg rejects as
"cowardly," the firm intends to seek an appraisal of the
value of Corroon shares in Delaware state court, a lengthy
procedure that sometimes yields a higher cash payment for
shares of a company involved in a merger.
   Mr. Steinberg declined to specify how many Corroon shares
Bear Stearns owns, but said the holding is "substantial." He
said Bear Stearns has sought appraisal rights in other merger
situations, which he declined to identify.
   In the case of the proposed Corroon-Willis Faber merger,
the issue of appraisal rights takes on added significance
because Willis Faber has reserved the right to walk away from
the deal if more than 9% of Corroon's shareholders file for
appraisal rights.
   Willis Faber could decide to complete the merger even if
more than 9% of Corroon's holders seek appraisal rights. But
if a significantly larger number of Corroon's holders seek
cash payment through the appraisal procedure, the proposed
tax-free treatment of the stock swap deal could be
endangered. It isn't clear exactly how many shareholders
could dissent without dooming a tax-free treatment.
   Robert Coffey, Corroon &amp; Black secretary, said the company
has received several appraisal requests from shareholders,
but he declined to say just how many the company has received
so far. He said the requests so far wouldn't block the
merger. "The notices are limited enough that we have
confidence in our ability to consummate the transaction," Mr.
Coffey said.
   A spokesman for Willis Faber declined to say what Willis
Faber will do if more than 9% of Corroon's holders seek
appraisal rights. "There is quite a lot of noise being made
about this at the moment," the spokesman said. "I think at
this stage we regard it as a rather hypothetical issue of the
moment . . . "
   Currently, other arbitragers don't hold out much hope that
the Corroon merger with Willis Faber will be blocked. Corroon
shares closed yesterday at $30 a share, up 37.5 cents in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Bear Stearns and other arbitragers are using the
appraisal-rights method of protesting the Corroon-Willis
Faber merger because they can't vote against the merger at a
Corroon shareholders meeting now scheduled for Oct. 4. Most
arbitragers bought their Corroon shares after Aon made its
proposal on Sept. 12, long after the Aug. 24 record date for
the Corroon holders meeting.
   To seek appraisal rights, shareholders must own their
shares at the time of the meeting and hold them until the
effective date of the merger. They also cannot vote in favor
of the merger.
   Bear Stearns, which sent out a report to its clients on
the Corroon merger earlier this week, argues that there's
little risk to seeking appraisal rights in this situation.
Holders can change their minds -- and take the Willis Faber
stock swap -- for as long as 60 days after the effective date
of the merger. And Bear Stearns argues that the $40 a share
cash proposal from Aon will serve as powerful evidence that a
higher price for Corroon shares is justified.
   The 9% limit on shareholders seeking appraisal rights was
significant under the original Corroon-Willis Faber merger
plan because a larger amount of dissenting shareholders would
kill an accounting treatment that the companies desired. But
Corroon's decision this week to pay a $2.50 a share special
dividend if the merger is approved has already doomed that
accounting treatment.
   Separately, two class-action shareholder lawsuits have
been filed against Corroon and its board since the company
rejected Aon's offer last week.
   Both lawsuits claim that by rejecting Aon's offer to
negotiate, Corroon breached its fiduciary duty to the
company's shareholders. The suit also alleges that since the
Aon offer was made after the proxy material was distributed
to shareholders, "they are victims of unfair dealing and
coercion" because they would be voting on the Willis Faber
merger without enough information.
   Corroon officials declined to comment on the lawsuits.

   CANBERRA, Australia -- August sales of new houses in
Australia rose 7.7% from July and 10% from a year earlier,
the Housing Industry Association, a trade group, said,
attributing the rebound to lower interest rates.
   The August sales were at the highest level in 17 months,
excluding a February miniboom caused by the introduction of
lower-interest, fixed-rate loans. Most of the increase in
August came from first-home buyers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The association said the "strong pickup" in sales since
June isn't reflected yet in official housing indicators.
Sales lead building approvals by two to three months, so
official approvals are likely to edge up in October and
November, and housing starts should rally in early 1991, the
group said.

   Franchising's Prospects Appear Bright, Specialist Says
   ---
   Patrick Boroian Expects Floodgates
   To Stay Open Even With a Recession
   ----

<LP>
   Franchising will keep booming, even though franchising
failures are more common than most people think. If a
recession develops, it will only increase the rush into
franchising.
   That is the forecast of Patrick J. Boroian, president of
Francorp Inc., a franchise development and consulting firm
based in Olympia Fields, Ill. An M.B.A. graduate of DePaul
University, Mr. Boroian became a management consultant and
specialist in franchising.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Typically, franchisers license their names and know-how to
investors, called franchisees, in exchange for initial fees,
ongoing royalties and, often, contracts to supply products
and services. Francorp's clients mostly are prospective
franchisers, whom the consulting concern helps to create and
market franchise programs.
   In a recent interview, Mr. Boroian talked mostly about
prospects for potential franchisees and franchisers.
                                                                                                       

   Q. If there is a recession, how will it affect
franchising?
   A. To the extent that it hurts retail sales, it obviously
will be negative. But paradoxically, it may have some
positive effects too. More companies won't have the capital
to expand with company-owned units, and that will make more
franchises available. And, of course, middle-management
personnel of more companies will be let go, and the sheer
number of prospects to buy franchises will rise.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Which sectors of franchising are especially attractive,
or unattractive, to investors right now?
   A. Some of the old-line industries that have franchised --
hotels, fast-food restaurants, car-rental agencies -- are
reaching near-saturation levels, and it's tough for
franchisees to make a good living. Investors don't perceive
those saturated industries as businesses of the future.
   On the other hand, some of the "information age"
franchises, business services and professional services are
doing well. We're also seeing aspects of distribution --
sales forces, delivery routes -- being franchised and doing
very well. Advantage Refreshments System in Los Angeles is a
distributor of vending machines that fired its entire sales
force and sold franchised sales territories. The result has
been higher sales and reduced overhead costs.
                                                                                                       

   Q. There's still a flood of offerings?
   A. Yes. That's largely because it is far less expensive to
franchise a business successfully today than it was, say, 10
years ago. Prior to 1975, there were 15 states that had
franchise registration requirements, and they were all
different. Franchising was generally a very expensive
proposition just from a legal point of view. Now uniform
disclosure documents are accepted in all the states. That
opened the floodgates for new franchises. The total cost for
becoming a franchiser can run as high as $200,000 or more,
but more often it can be done for $100,000 to $200,000.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Who are the new entrants?
   A. What we typically see is a small company that has built
up one or several outlets. They may or may not be performing
well financially.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Don't investors tend to shun unprofitable franchisers?
   A. Generally, yes. But 85% of the franchisers out there do
not provide an earnings claim. So the first few people who
buy into such a franchise are buying on faith. It's like
buying a stock that's relatively unknown: If you buy the
right one, it can go to the moon. But there's also a higher
chance of failure.
                                                                                                       

   Q. In general, how risky is it to become a franchisee?
   A. The Department of Commerce has said about 5% of
franchisees go out of business in any given year. What that
statistic doesn't reveal is the number of franchisees who
have failed, but who have been bought out, either by another
franchisee or by the franchiser. The real number of failures
every year is probably 10%.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How do you know if you are paying too much in
royalties?
   A. You're overpaying a royalty if it doesn't leave you a
competitive rate of return after all your expenses. But you
can't just look at the price. You can't just say 8% is too
high and 3% is too low. It depends what you're getting back
in support -- in advertising, new products, consulting
advice. In the temporary-help business, the franchiser takes
50% of gross profit. On the surface that sounds exorbitantly
high. But those franchisers finance the payrolls of the
franchisees.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How can investors tell if a franchise offering is
sizzle or steak?
   A. If an opportunity sounds good, you owe it to yourself
to visit the franchiser's headquarters and meet the
management. Also, by law you receive an offering circular,
containing a lot of detail about the franchise. That document
should be reviewed by a CPA and by a lawyer who looks at
fairness and enforceability. Most important, you should do
some due diligence and talk to some existing franchisees to
find out how they're doing.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How much capital is needed to become a franchisee?
   A. The cheapest franchises, which may be home-based, can
be as low as $10,000 -- total investment. You can go up as
high as $7 million or $10 million. Most franchises are in the
$50,000 to $250,000 range; the average is about $140,000.
Generally, up until the recent credit crunch, you could get
into a franchise with about 20% or 25% of that in cash.
Today, however, franchisees are needing to come up with about
40% in cash. The rest can be financed by a bank, providing
you're willing to give personal guarantees and pledge
personal assets as collateral.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Besides money, what does it take to be a successful
franchisee?
   A. Most franchisers require the full time and attention of
the franchisee. Obviously, that is not always practical;
someone who might buy five (hamburger) franchises for $1.5
million apiece isn't very likely to stand behind the counter
and flip burgers. In those cases, there are financial
partners and operating partners. But the operating partners
must make at least 10% of the investment with their own
money; that's what creates the motivation. If you look at
franchisee failures, many times they're due to an absentee
investor, someone who has the money but is not in the
trenches. You build a successful business a brick at a time,
a hamburger at a time.

   Left-wing gunslingers in El Salvador have found a new ally
to help wreck the country's already precarious economy. On
the agenda awaiting Procter &amp; Gamble shareholders in
Cincinnati on Oct. 9 is a proposal to stop the company from
buying Salvadoran coffee beans for its Folger's unit. James
Gamble, an heir to the P&amp;G fortune, blames Salvadoran
landowners for the continuing strife, and in alliance with a
few family members and another shareholder, has asked that
the company slam the producers with a boycott. The company
itself has let it be known that it does not wish to depart
from U.S. government policies. While Mr. Gamble can no doubt
afford to savor a pricier brew as he ponders his activist
agenda, we doubt he will be toasted by small Salvadoran
farmers and workers who would be hurt by the boycott.

   Washington just relived a famous scene from an Indiana
Jones movie. Shrouded in black, the bad guy brandished his
scimitar expertly, seemingly poised to do great damage to our
hero. Jones shrugged, pulled out his gun, and shot the
villain down. This is about what happened to stunned Members
of Congress on Tuesday when New Hampshire Sununu pulled out a
copy of the Anti-Deficiency Act.
   The White House Chief of Staff announced that if there is
no budget deal, President Bush is ready to veto any
continuing resolution and go directly to the Gramm-Rudman
budget cuts. There will be no melodramatic apocalyse for the
evening newscasts because Mr. Bush, under his authority in
the Anti-Deficiency Act, can manage the sequester to avoid
chaos.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As we wrote Tuesday, the Anti-Deficiency Act is the law
that says Congress must approve all government expenditures,
but with one huge exception: The President can order
expenditures "in cases of emergency involving the safety of
human life or the protection of property." This gives Mr.
Bush great discretion to keep paying essential government
workers even when Congress fails to write a budget.
   Mr. Sununu took to Capitol Hill a 12-page interpretation
of the Anti-Deficiency Act written by Jimmy Carter's Attorney
General, Benjamin Civiletti, in 1981. The end-is-nigh media
reports warn that Gramm-Rudman would mean havoc in the skies
from fewer air-traffic controllers, a vegetarian diet for
Americans from the furloughing of meat inspectors, the
rending of garments, and the weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Nonsense. As examples of where "life" or "property" are so at
risk that the President can keep people at their jobs, Mr.
Civiletti's memo cited air traffic and meat inspection.
   There is nothing in Gramm-Rudman that limits the
President's emergency powers under the pre-existing
Anti-Deficiency Act. White House budget officials are
probably now reviewing which workers are essential and which
can be sent home. The Reagan administration went through this
drill when it kept essential workers on even after vetoing
continuing resolutions. Military personnel, the FBI and
federal prison guards are clearly necessary to protect life
and property. Congressional staffers most likely come under a
different heading. Some things, of course, cannot be
protected: It's hard to imagine the threat to life or
property from closing down the office that sends out
Congress's franked mail.
   There are some other improvements Mr. Bush could make to
the distribution of cuts under Gramm-Rudman. Education, Labor
and the EPA are among the agencies scheduled for sequester
cuts of less than 5%. Maybe when a budget is eventually
passed these agencies can contribute to a fund to pay air
traffic controllers.
   The Monday deadline for Gramm-Rudman is where
separation-of-powers hits the rubber. "As the law is now
written, the nation must rely initially for the efficient
operation of government on the timely and responsible
functioning of the legislative process," Mr. Civiletti wrote
in his memo. "The Constitution and the Anti-Deficiency Act
itself leave the Executive leeway to perform essential
functions and make the government `workable.'"
   There is fine justice in the prospect of Congress losing
control over the budget because of its recidivist failure to
pass budgets within legal deadlines. Mr. Bush has every right
and even an obligation to use his Anti-Deficiency Act powers
to avoid any mindless sequester. Congress can agree to a
budget that guarantees spending cuts and creates incentives
for economic growth. Or it can watch Mr. Bush solve the
budget deficit on his own.

   Threatens to Kill
   Value-Added Tax

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian Senate is threatening to defeat the
government's proposed value-added tax, causing alarm in the
business community that has spent millions of dollars
preparing for the new levy.
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson told the House of Commons
yesterday that businessmen are saying there will be "chaos"
if the tax is scrapped.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sears Canada Inc., a Canadian subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck
&amp; Co., said it has ordered 3.5 million copies of its spring
catalog with prices based on the proposed tax taking effect
Jan. 1, as planned by the government. It has also purchased
about 1,000 new cash registers and reprogrammed other
equipment to cope with the levy.
   Coinamatic Group, which operates 70,000 coin-activated
laundry machines, said it has been converting its equipment
to take more quarters to cover the cost of the new tax. But
the company has suspended plans to raise its prices to cover
the cost of the value-added tax, pending the outcome of the
legislative battle, said Richard Adamson, the company's
financial vice president.
   The proposed tax was approved by the House of Commons last
April, but has encountered strong resistance from the
opposition Liberal Party in the Senate, an appointed chamber.
The Liberals hold 52 of the 104 Senate seats.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the Liberals are
threatening to undermine Canadian democracy, by frustrating
"the will of the duly elected representatives of the people,"
in the House of Commons.
   To try to get the tax bill through the Senate, he
threatened to use for the first time in Canadian history an
exceptional constitutional power that allows the government
to appoint eight additional senators.
   Such action would require the approval of Queen Elizabeth,
the British monarch who is Canada's titular head of state.
Buckingham Palace officials told the Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. that the Queen would approve the appointment of
additional senators if her approval was requested.
   Businesses, on government instruction, have been
collecting the proposed goods and services tax since Sept. 1
on any transactions that include 1991 business. The National
Arts Centre in Ottawa said that if the tax bill is defeated
it will have to reimburse customers who have paid the tax on
tickets for 1991 productions. "We're waiting like everybody
else to see if the tax is adopted," said box office manager
Robert Cousineau. "It is a bit stressful."
   The new tax, which is to cover most goods and services,
was designed to replace an outmoded 13.5% tax that is applied
at the manufacturers' level on a narrower range of products.
   Manufacturers of some products, including autos, have said
their prices will decline if the tax change occurs. To
encourage car buyers to purchase now instead of waiting for
the proposed tax change, Mercedes-Benz Canada Inc. is
offering a 3.5% price cut until Dec. 31.
   The uncertainty about the tax has been heightened by the
plans of the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia to
fight the proposed tax in the courts. The two provinces claim
the proposed tax is unconstitutional and infringes on
provincial rights. British Columbia also has threatened to
challenge in the court any move by the government to appoint
new government supporters to the Senate to get the tax bill
passed.

   CIGNA Corp. (Philadelphia) -- David W. Johnson was named a

   Ex-Disney Official,
   Mitsubishi Team Up
   For Theme Parks

   Mitsubishi International Corp. said it teamed up with a
former executive of Walt Disney Co. to develop theme parks
and related businesses in the U.S., Japan and elsewhere.
   Under terms of the agreement, Mitsubishi International, a
subsidiary of Japan-based Mitsubishi Corp., invested in Steve
Baker &amp; Associates. Steve Baker, based in Orlando, Fla., is
headed by the 42-year-old Mr. Baker, who left the Disney
company in 1988 after 22 years and owns 25% of the firm.
Financial terms weren't disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Mitsubishi isn't buying any assets and has no
theme parks on the drawing board as yet, it joins a growing
roster of Japanese concerns seeking a foothold in the U.S.
entertainment business. Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp.
is having discussions regarding a possible acquisition of MCA
Corp., which owns Universal Studios and theme parks, and Sony
Corp. bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and is
exploring the development of theme parks, among other things.
   Steve Baker &amp; Associates, a sponsorship and management
firm with nine employees, seven of whom are former Disney
executives, specializes in the theme park industry. The
company raises sponsorship revenue for entertainment and
leisure projects, such as Ocean Expo, a marineland water
park, under construction in Myrtle Beach, S.C., for Addcorp,
a theme park concern also based in Myrtle Beach.
   "Mitsubishi has been our client for 10 months and they
want us to introduce them to the theme park business," said
Mr. Baker, who previously served as operator of Disney's
Magic Kingdom theme park and ultimately became head of
corporate sponsorship for Disney's Epcot Center in Florida.
Mr. Baker developed and coordinated contracts for more than
40 American corporations represented at the Magic Kingdom and
Epcot.
   Mitsubishi International registers about $14 billion in
trade transactions annually, handling more than 25,000 items
from raw materials to advanced electronics.
   Although financial analysts said there is a possible glut
of theme parks, "it can be extremely healthy if you undertake
a project carefully," said Seth A. Schachner, assistant
manager of business development at Mitsubishi International.
   Harold Vogel, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said
although there is an "abundance" of theme parks, "a well
thought-out park with a good location can still be
successful." Mr. Vogel estimated that admission for large
amusement parks in the U.S. last year totaled about $130
million.
   Mr. Schachner said the companies are "developing a number
of projects," although he declined to be specific and said no
timetable was set.

   The War Against Wealth

<LP>
   In the perennial war against wealth that afflicts
capitalism, envy is always the engine. The prime goal is to
discredit the claim that the rich earn the right to reinvest
their earnings.
   Today in America, the acids of envy are lapping at the
foundations of the system, with confiscatory capital gains
taxes, new state surtaxes and an all-out government campaign
against so-called junk bonds. Driving the campaign to a
climax is the lust for a living sacrifice, to be achieved
through the defamation, discrediting and final imprisonment
of Michael Milken.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now as Milken approaches sentence for a series of subtle
regulatory infractions, major investment journalists and
government officials rush to paint him in lurid colors as a
mugger, mobster or racketeer. In the case against Milken as a
Ponzischemer whose junk bond market concealed massive rot at
the foundations, the prime exhibit is a study by High Yield
Associates of New York.
   Supposedly refuting Drexel Burnham claims of an annual
default rate of 1.5%, HYA computed the cumulative rate of
defaults and troubled exchanges for each class of Drexel
issues from 1977 to 1989. The picture seemed grim indeed. For
example, the 1977 class saw 43% defaulted or exchanged for
low value securities by 1988; the 1981 class saw a 54% rate
of defaults or troubled exchanges by 1989. Other years ran
from 10% by 1989 for the 1982 cohort to 23% by 1989 for the
1986 cohort.
   It is true that by combining large recent issuing years
with years of far smaller totals, the Drexel overall default
figure of 1.5% misrepresented the real risks of high-yield
securities. A more accurate, though very conservative,
indicator of Mr. Milken's performance is the average annual
rate of return for his junk securities through 1989.
Including post-Milken issues, that rate is 11.7%, well above
the 9.6% annual yield of long-term Treasury bonds.
   Not only did purchasers of junk bonds gain high average
yields but shareholders in issuing firms also thrived. A 1989
study by John Pound of Harvard and Lilli Gordon of the
Analysis Group showed that high yield issuers increased cash
flow, profits and dividends and on average doubled their
price-earnings ratios. Michael Jensen of Harvard estimates
that junk bonds and buy-outs benefited shareholders by a
total of some $400 billion.
   In other words, beyond all the defaults and troubled
exchanges, high yield securities fulfilled their promise of
above average yields. Indeed they offered real rates of
return far above government bonds during the inflationary
1970s or stocks since 1973. To say that high yield securities
are a scam because many default is like saying that
capitalism is a scam because an estimated half of all
business startups fail within five years.
   The Pound-Gordon-Jensen figures include the issues --
roughly 40% of the total -- done by firms other than Drexel.
Despite a hugely greater exposure and its catastrophe between
1986 and 1989, Drexel outpaced most other high yield issuers.
Drexel's average annual rate of return on junk between 1977
and 1989 was well above the average for the market. Its
overall rate of defaults and troubled exchanges for all junk
issued between 1977 to 1990 was 9.6%. The rates for its
prominent rivals were: Merrill Lynch, 19.3%; PaineWebber,
43.1%; and L.F. Rothschild, 44.7%.
   The real target of the more frenzied enemies of Mr.
Milken, however, is not the junk bond but the supposedly
decadent U.S. economy of the 1980s, ridden with debt, low
investment and low productivity. The business expansion of
the 1980s, however, exceeded the recoveries of the 1960s and
1970s in precisely the areas where junk bonds were
concentrated. Business fixed investment, for example, reached
an average of 12% of GNP, substantially higher than in the
1960s and 1970s recoveries, and capital equipment spending
averaged 8.4% of GNP, compared to 5.7% in the 1960s and 7.3%
in the 1970s. In remarkable contrast to critics' claims,
manufacturing rose slightly as a proportion of GNP and
manufacturing productivity growth at 3.9% exceeded the record
of 3.3% during the 1960s boom. U.S. industrial output rose
41.5% in the 1980s, and the U.S. increased its share of
global employment, exports and manufactures.
   All these gains jibe closely with the focus of junk bond
issues. As economist Glenn Yago documents in "Junk Bonds," to
be published this fall by Oxford University Press, junk bond
issuers accounted for some 82% of all the annual job growth
of all public companies between 1980 and 1986. Overall, junk
bond issuers created jobs four times faster than the economy
as a whole, achieved a one-third higher growth in
productivity, increased sales 50% faster and generated three
times faster growth in capital spending. Some 33.9% of all
issuers were manufacturing companies and between 1980 and
1986, they increased capital spending four times faster than
the manufacturing sector as a whole and accounted for nearly
40% of all the growth in capital spending among public
manufacturing firms.
   More important still was the critical role of junk bonds
in financing such crucial American businesses as fiber
optics, telecommunications and television. Drexel managed
multibillion dollar issues for Turner Broadcasting, MCI,
Tele-Communications Inc., McCaw Cellular, and many other
companies without firm collateral -- companies that could not
possibly have raised comparable sums anywhere else. These
firms, backed by Drexel, have been critical to U.S.
competitiveness in communications not only by their own
contributions but by providing markets for many U.S. high
tech suppliers.
   In addition, as documented in a study by John Paulus and
Stephen Waite of Morgan Stanley, high yield securities have
been critical to the computer industry. Between 1985 and
1989, some 80% of all computer industry finance came from
junk, including crucial issues during downturns for Compaq,
Silicon Graphics, Cray Research, Alliant, Convex and Evans &amp;
Sutherland, all among the elite in the business. The hard
disk drive industry, also an American forte, was saved from
ruin by junk, including $250 million for Seagate and large
issues for Connor, Maxtor and other major firms that won for
the U.S. more than 70% of the world market. Micro Technology
and VLSI Technology were among the recipients of the $500
million in high-yields that financed the microchip industry.
Junk alone, often supplied by Morgan Stanley when Drexel
foundered, enabled these firms to survive downturns without
selling out to foreigners.
   One of the most amazing canards of Mr. Milken's critics is
the notion that junk bonds somehow caused the savings &amp; loan
crisis. Only 5.3% of S&amp;Ls held any junk bonds at all and
their junk comprised less than 1% of all S&amp;L assets. But the
firms that did use these securities were among the most
successful of all thrifts until the draconian measures of
July 1989 forced them to mark down and sell most of their
holdings into a sinking market within 90 days.
   From the capital gains tax debate to the boycott of Korean
grocers in Harlem, from the assault on Chinese entrepreneurs
to the invasion of Kuwait, the war against wealth continues.
Fueled as usual by envy and ignorance, the current siege
against Mike Milken and junk bonds is a symbol of that
perpetual struggle at the heart of capitalism. But in
sacrificing him, the U.S. is succumbing to an obscurantist
disease that can ultimately cripple American competitiveness
and prosperity.

   Southland Says
   Bankruptcy Filing
   May Be Possibility

   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said it may seek bankruptcy
court protection if bondholders don't approve by Oct. 22 a
debt-swap offer needed to complete a $430 million bailout by
the company's Japanese partners.
   The bankruptcy threat came as part of an announcement that
the debt-swap offer, which was to expire at midnight Tuesday,
would be extended for a fourth time, to Oct. 22, as well as
sweetened in a way designed to attract minority holders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ito-Yokado Co., operator of the company's 7-Eleven stores
in Japan, also extended to Oct. 22 its offer to buy 70% of
Southland for $430 million, cash desperately needed by the
debt-laden convenience store operators.
   To complete the bailout, Southland needs tenders from
bondholders representing 95% of each of five classes of
notes. But Tuesday night it remained far short of that.
Approvals from one class, the 16.75% notes, remained as low
as 45.6%.
   To get around the 95% approval requirement, Southland said
it is considering filing a prepackaged bankruptcy plan. In
such a case, a company enters court with a reorganization
plan already approved by 50% of its bondholders representing
at least two-thirds of its debt. If the court approves the
plan, minority holdouts are legally bound to it.
   Southland predicted that it could complete a prepackaged
bankruptcy within six months. It also said that Ito-Yokado
"presently" was willing to consummate its bailout "within the
context of a prepackaged reorganization," if necessary.
   Southland said it amended the debt-swap offer to include a
cash-election option for holders of less than $300,000 of its
notes. The option gives such holders the right to trade their
existing notes for cash instead of new debt. For instance,
for each $1,000 principal amount of Southland 16.50% notes, a
holder could receive $227.87 in cash. Such holders would
still participate in the proposed transfer of 25% of
Southland common stock to bondholders. Observers say the cash
option is designed to bring hard-to-find minority holders out
of the woodwork.
   In July Southland, operator of about 6,700 7-Eleven and
other convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went into
default on debt taken on in its $4.9 billion 1987 leveraged
buy-out. Under its proposed bailout plan, Ito-Yokado would
get 75% of the company, bondholders would get 25% and the
founding Thompson family of Dallas would see its stake shrink
to 5%.

   We have a constructive suggestion for the budget summit
negotiators now deadlocked out at that converted bar at
Andrews Air Force Base: a change of venue. They should pick
up their talks and move them 100 miles down the road to
Richmond, Virginia. They can then call in Democratic Governor
L. Douglas Wilder and have him explain how he is coping with
his state's budget deficit without any tax increases.
   Governor Wilder became the nation's first black governor
in January after a campaign in which he promised economy in
government along with "no new taxes -- and I mean it." The
slowdown in Virginia's economy has put his promise to the
test. The state faces an unexpected $1.4 billion deficit out
of a $26 billion budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Wilder has risen to the challenge. He says new taxes
would only damage the state's long-term ability to create
jobs and expand economic opportunity to the poor. Instead, he
proposes to do what private businesses do every day -- trim
back on labor costs and cut expenditures to make limited
means and infinite ends meet.
   In a remarkable speech last month, Governor Wilder said he
will insist that the state follow some common-sense budget
principles: 1) "You spend your money wisely -- first on the
necessities of life, and then -- and only then -- on the
niceties." 2) "In the event of financial difficulty, you
tighten your belt." And 3) "You act responsibly, and you
don't spend beyond your means."
   Governor Wilder's plan calls for the state to balance its
budget by cutting 5.3% from projected state spending, or
about $1.4 billion. Even with the cuts, state spending still
will increase by 7.6% over the last budget. Larry Hunter,
deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
calls the Wilder plan "a combination of vision and
practicality that few in Washington seem capable of."
   Governor Wilder says his plan shouldn't surprise anyone.
It is taken from his campaign speeches in which he said the
state should "keep taxes down, and if at all possible, secure
tax cuts." The fact that state government grew 10% a year
during the 1980s means that Virginia now will have to "make
permanent, not temporary adjustments in its spending
patterns."
   Among these "adjustments" is a cut of $375 million in
state agencies. Spending on the poor and sick will be spared,
but other state agencies will have to rein in their
ambitions. A top target will be cuts in the central
bureaucracy running the state's educational system. With many
states doing business by mail and fax, the number of state
field offices will be frozen. A program in which driver's
license issuers visited rural residents in their homes will
end. The Department of World Trade, the Council on the Status
of Women, and the Council on Indians will have their
functions transferred to other agencies.
   There will be other savings. State employees will forgo a
pay raise next year. Some 1,100 state employees will be laid
off, but that number could be reduced by repealing a law
barring early retirement programs for state workers. Governor
Wilder also wants to encourage the privatization of such
government services as road-building. He has been an
enthusiastic backer of a proposed 18-mile private toll road
near Dulles Airport.
   If Congress and the White House could bring themselves to
make the same level of cuts as the Wilder plan does, federal
spending for fiscal 1991 would be reduced by more than $72
billion. That's the lion's share of the $85 billion in cuts
required by the Gramm-Rudman sequester, and would still mean
that federal spending would grow by $19 billion over the 1990
budget. The remaining $12 billion or so in needed budget cuts
could be made up with the capital-gains tax cut.
   Virginia Republicans say Governor Wilder is only holding
firm on taxes because he is running for a spot on the 1992
Democratic ticket. His record as a moderate makes that, at
best, a partial explanation. Even if true, it simply means
Governor Wilder has recognized that the public is fed up with
politics as usual and with incumbent officeholders who
promise to make tough choices but raise taxes instead. If his
common-sense fiscal approach succeeds it will be a lesson to
more timid politicians in both parties that putting the
bureaucracy on a diet makes for better government and smart
politics.

   NEW YORK -- Investors knocked down stock prices, spooked
by rising oil prices and a rout overnight in Japanese stocks.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25.99 to 2459.65 in
moderate trading. Longterm U.S. Treasury bond prices were
flat in light activity. The dollar was mixed, also in thin
trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even though oil prices overseas were lower before U.S.
stock markets opened yesterday, the mood among traders was
negative because of the sharp drop in Tokyo stocks. The
Nikkei index plunged 4.75% on Mideast jitters.
   The decline in U.S. stocks nearly wiped out Tuesday's
32.67 point gain in the Dow industrials. "Everyone is looking
to get out now," said Christopher Pedersen, director of
trading at Twenty-First Securities. "People are looking for
2200" on the Dow, he added.
   Mr. Pedersen said another depressant for stock investors
was a report in this paper suggesting that investors
shouldn't take it for granted that the Big Three auto makers'
current dividend levels are sacrosanct. "That's not very
comforting," he said.
   Another blow to stocks was a sharp reversal in oil prices
soon after trading began. Crude oil futures for November
delivery ended the day up $1.14 a barrel at $38.67, after
being down briefly as much as $1 from Tuesday's close. Peter
Beutel, oil futures analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group,
said the initial oil price decline -- following a drop the
previous day -- was halted by some investors who saw the dip
as a buying opportunity.
   Oil prices kept moving higher on U.S. Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney's comments to a gathering of economists that
the embargo may be pushing Iraq to the brink of lashing out
militarily. Also, a spate of unconfirmed war rumors ran
through oil trading pits -- including one that Iraq had given
the U.S. 48 hours to leave the Mideast.
   While current oil supplies appear adequate, Mr. Beutel
said that traders are justified in bidding prices as high as
they are, since war remains a strong possibility, and an
Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabian oil fields is likely if
hostilities break out. "Saudi oil can't be replaced," he
said. "The only people with spare capacity on that level are
Iraq and Kuwait."
   While bond price movements were shallow, said Raymond W.
Stone of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates, those
movements nevertheless followed the opposite path of oil-up
in the morning on lower oil prices, down in the afternoon on
higher oil.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 155.6 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues overwhelmed
advancers, 1,119 to 421.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 9.12%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency fell to 1.5650 marks from 1.5725 marks and rose
slightly to 136.84 yen from 136.72 yen Tuesday.

   Fear Overcomes Greed to Make
   For Loathing of Favored Stocks

   NEW YORK -- You know the stock market isn't in great shape
when money managers can't resist the urge to unload their
best stocks.
   For example, James LaTorre, vice president, investments,
at the Ivy Fund, is trimming his holdings of U.S. Surgical, a
fast-growing medical instrument concern. U.S. Surgical's
share price has nearly doubled in value this year. The stock
trades at about 40 times the company's annual per-share
earnings, compared with a ratio of about 14.5 and falling for
the overall market, and this makes Mr. LaTorre nervous.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Nothing goes straight up," he said. "The first negative
thing that comes across about the stock will send it
tanking."
   Fear is as familiar as greed on Wall Street, but it
doesn't often permeate so strongly the hallowed upper
echelons of favored growth stocks, especially blue chips. But
it is doing so now, as some of money managers' favorite
growth stocks of the year are being pummeled almost daily.
This is the result of money managers' getting out before
their worst fears materialize: safe-haven stocks being sucked
into the vortex of the market's downward spiral.
   "PepsiCo, and growth stocks like it, are the last to go,
but when they go, they'll go fast," Harvey Eisen, president
of SunAmerica Asset Management Corp., said. "This is really a
textbook 1973-1974 bear market."
   In that period nearly two decades ago, Mr. Eisen recalled,
a few growth stocks managed to hang above the sinking market
for a time. But eventually they fell mightily.
   "There are a thousand reasons why people are selling these
stocks" now, said Thomas Gallagher, managing director,
capital commitment, at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "But the main reason
is that we are in a bear market. And there's the feeling that
your first sale is your best sale."
   Growth stocks, Mr. LaTorre of Ivy Fund said, "are like
magnets," as they were earlier this year, when they were
leading the market higher and higher. Now, he said,
"Everybody is attracted to them in terms of selling," because
they are actively traded and easy to sell.
   When he was raising cash in August, Mr. LaTorre trimmed
his portfolio of Coca-Cola, Federal National Mortgage
Association and Aluminum Co. of America, among other issues,
even though he still likes these big stocks.
   "These were the `Nifty 50,' one-decision stocks, and now
the decision is, `Get me out,'" Jack Solomon, technical
analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said.
   Indeed, many of these stocks are falling faster than
second-tier issues. Aside from "recession resistant"
earnings, "unique products," "international franchises" and
"market niches" -- the buzz words bandied about in promoting
growth-stock investing this summer -- money managers are
finding that these issues are also full of volatility. These
are falling as speedily as they rose two months ago.
   For example, Lincoln Capital Management Co.'s U.S. Growth
Portfolio -- chock full of stocks such as Waste Management,
Merck and Reuters Holdings -- is down about 7% so far this
month, compared with a 4.2% decline in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index.
   J. David Mills, senior vice president at Boston Co.
Advisers, said the current decline in big stocks shows that
money managers are dumping relatively expensive shares and
buying cheaper stocks. "Anything that hasn't gone down is
vulnerable," he said.
   As the market rallied to a record high in July, many
smaller stocks lagged behind. Money managers jumped into
highgrowth stocks and shares of big
disposable-consumer-products makers, to buttress their
portfolios against a recession, which can ravage corporate
earnings. For the year through Tuesday, a group of 5,000
stocks tracked by Wilshire Associates Inc., minus the stocks
in the S&amp;P 500, is down 17.87%, compared with a 10.44%
decline in the S&amp;P.
   But this month, the stock market pillars have come
tumbling down. Escalating oil prices have cast the projected
inflation-adjusted returns of growth issues into doubt. And
higher energy prices have cut into spending, calling into
question earnings estimates at consumer-products companies.
   Medical-supply and household-products companies are about
the only industry groups showing a gain this year, aside from
energy and gold.
   If a prolonged bear market takes hold, though, "There is
no place to hide," Ronald Sloan, executive vice president at
Siebel Capital Management Inc., said. "The hardest thing to
do is sit on your hands and let the thing play out."
   The selling isn't expected to abate in the next few days,
because many money managers want to show their clients a
hefty cash position at the end of the current quarter.
   "So far, we need a couple of more things to happen to
split the stock market like a ripe watermelon," Mr. Eisen of
SunAmerica Asset Management said. In his view, this could
simply be sharply higher oil prices and double-digit yields
on long-term bonds; the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond
yesterday finished with a yield of 9.12%.
   Through such clouds, however, Mr. Eisen already is
anticipating finding silver linings. The market's current
decline is "setting the stage for one of the great
money-making opportunities," he said, because stocks will
fall to "preposterous" levels.
   When will it be time to buy? "You have to have lucidity,"
he acknowledged, "and when you are lying in the gutter
bleeding, it is hard to look" at stocks and say they have
finally fallen enough. All he knows is that, for the moment,
the market "is awful."

   Tecumseh Products Co. said it will have a third-quarter
loss of about $14 million to $16 million, after taking a
$19.2 million charge for an environmental cleanup near a
plant.
   The Tecumseh, Mich., maker of compressors, engines and
pumps said the per-share loss will be about $2.50 to $3.

   The charge, which comes to $3.51 a share, goes to clean up
PCB contamination in the Sheboygan River near a Tecumseh
die-casting plant. The plant used PCB, a suspected
carcinogen, as a fire retardant in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Tecumseh had net income of $27 million, or $4.94 a share,
in the first half of 1990.

   OTTAWA -- Canada and the U.S. have reached an agreement
aimed at reducing tensions between U.S. fishermen and
Canadian patrol boats.
   The clashes have occurred mainly in Georges Bank, a big
fishing ground in the Gulf of Maine, where some U.S.
fishermen who have been caught fishing in Canadian waters
have tried to outrun Canadian patrol boats. Disputes also
have occurred on the Pacific Coast, where Canadian fishermen
have been caught in U.S. waters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement requires each country to prohibit its
fishermen from violating the fisheries laws of the other
country.
   "Fishermen who violate fisheries laws in the other country
will no longer be able to escape enforcement action by
crossing back across the border into their own waters,"
Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said. The accord
also will reduce tensions along boundary areas, he said.

   Putting It `Together' Is New Xerox Theme

   The top brass at Xerox Corp. have convinced themselves
that the copier maker has been transformed into "the Document
Company." Now they have to convince the rest of the world.
   On Monday, Xerox will begin an advertising campaign that
attempts to broaden the company's image beyond the product
that is synonymous with its name. Some of the ads also will
pitch a product that hasn't been introduced yet, known
internally as "Xenith," that Xerox is betting its future on.
The new machine is a do-it-all contraption that combines
computing, scanning, faxing, copying and other capabilities
to create high-quality reports.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new ad campaign, with the theme "Putting It Together,"
features shots of office workers preparing and using such
documents. The Broadway show tune "Putting It Together," from
Stephen Sondheim's "Sunday in the Park with George" musical,
plays in the background of all the ads. The spots finish with
the line: "Xerox. The Document Company." The campaign is the
first developed for the company by Young &amp; Rubicam, the
agency that Xerox chose in July to replace Backer Spielvogel
Bates on its $25 million account.
   "We're aligning all the energy of the company to focus not
on our products, but on the product of our products, which is
a document," says Len Vickers, senior vice president of
world-wide marketing at Xerox. "The document is going to be a
big issue in the 1990s."
   But Xerox faces a stiff challenge in changing its image
from the familiar to the slightly more complex. Marketing
consultants say they aren't sure exactly what "The Document
Company" means. "Maybe a document is something more than just
a copy, but you really have to think hard to make a
meaningful distinction," says Clive Chajet, chairman and
chief executive officer of Lippincott &amp; Margulies Inc., an
image consultant.
   Xerox, though, insists that there's a difference, and that
the positioning is right on target. In a bid to help business
executives understand, Xerox is adopting almost a
bang-'em-over-the-head strategy by running many lengthy
60-second TV ads that pitch the process of putting together
documents "bit by bit . . . piece by piece," according to the
Sondheim lyrics.
   "The kind of executives we are talking to aren't walking
around thinking `I've got document problems,'" Mr. Vickers
says. "But they have business problems for which document
solutions are the answer," he adds.
   One newspaper ad asks the question: "How much are you
spending on documents that never get read?" The ad pitches
the importance of creating "business documents that are
inviting and involving . . . documents that truly reflect the
intelligence and uniqueness of your thinking."
   Some of the TV spots are more exotic. One features art
restorers at work fixing a fresco on the ceiling of an
Italian chapel. They're shown looking at maps of the original
work. In another ad, astronauts are shown heading out to the
launch pad while they check out last-minute documents and
schedules. In yet another, a weight lifter in a wheelchair
notes his progress on a weight-lifting chart on the wall.
   Eric Weber, vice chairman and creative director at Young &amp;
Rubicam, concedes that the perception of Xerox as just a
"copier maker" is still alive. "But just by saying `Putting
It Together,' we began dramatically changing that perception"
in consumer focus groups, he says. The company plans an
aggressive ad schedule, with TV, radio and print ads
scheduled throughout the fourth quarter.
   The new ads differ markedly from early Xerox ads, many of
which won accolades for their use of humor. One famous Xerox
pitchman was Brother Dominick, a monk who won the approval of
his superiors by making quick copies with a Xerox machine.
And yucks also abounded in a spot in which a nerdy football
player named Kolodny handed copies of a game plan to his
teammates on the field. Most recently, Xerox ran ads
centering on its Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
   There are hints, though, that Young &amp; Rubicam may
eventually lead Xerox back to its irreverent roots. One ad
still being shot features a group of corporate workers
toiling late on an important business proposal. But when it's
discovered that the firm's eccentric CEO will be giving the
presentation, the workers frantically use the Xerox equipment
to enlarge the type and make other adjustments. The next day,
the young workers watch through a two-way mirror as the CEO
does a commendable job.
   In any event, Xerox says it's committed to the "Putting It
Together" campaign for the long run. "It's a 10-year idea or
longer," Mr. Vickers says. "We're not going to change our
tune on this one. We've made our bet . . . and this is it."

   Ad Age Names Top 100

   Philip Morris retained its position as top U.S. advertiser
in 1989, with $2.07 billion in spending, according to a
report by Advertising Age magazine.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, at $1.79 billion, finished second to
Philip Morris for the third consecutive year. Sears, Roebuck
edged out General Motors for the No. 3 spot this year,
spending $1.43 billion. General Motors fell to No. 4, at
$1.35 billion.
   Total spending by the top 100 national advertisers, at
$33.9 billion, was up 6.4% from 1988. The rate of spending
growth slowed slightly from 1988, when spending increased
6.7% over the previous year.
   The top four advertisers -- the only ones to break the $1
billion spending mark -- accounted for nearly 20% of the top
100 total. Likewise, the top 100 spenders accounted for more
than three-fourths of total U.S. ad spending.
   Network TV remained the most popular ad medium, accounting
for 21.4% of the top 100's overall ad spending and growing
2.7% to $7.2 billion. But its dominance among national
measured media is being eroded by jumps in syndicated TV and
cable TV, which grew 43% and 27.4%, respectively.

portfolio through tough new credit procedures and policies.

   Mr. Taylor began his banking career in 1948 with American
Trust Co., eventually becoming chairman of the credit policy
committee at Wells Fargo &amp; Co., which acquired American. He
left Wells Fargo in 1983 to become chief credit officer of
BankAmerica's financially troubled Seafirst Bank unit.
   Mr. Taylor will be succeeded as head of credit policy by
executive vice president Michael E. Rossi, 45, now head of
Bank of America's commercial banking division. Following his
retirement, Mr. Taylor will continue as a director of both
Seafirst Corp. and Seafirst Bank, and as a credit-policy
consultant to BankAmerica.

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. named
Parks H. Dalton chairman and chief executive officer.
   Mr. Dalton, 60 years old, had been chairman emeritus of
the company. He succeeds J. Craighill Redwine, 49, who
resigned in late August.

   Interstate/Johnson, one of the largest brokerage firms in
the Southeast, has had several quarters of declining revenue
and widening losses. In the quarter ended June 30, the
company had a loss of $1.4 million, or 20 cents a share, on
revenue of $31.9 million. The loss included a $750,000 charge
related to litigation.
   At the time of Mr. Redwine's resignation, the company said
it was reviewing its businesses and options to develop a
"strategic direction."
   Mr. Dalton had been chief executive officer of Interstate
Securities from 1968 to 1986 and chairman through January
1988 before the company's merger with Johnson Lane. In

   Economy:
   Poverty Rate Eased Slightly Last Year
   As Gap Between Rich and Poor Widened

   WASHINGTON -- The percentage of Americans living in
poverty continued to decline in 1989, but the disparities
between rich and poor continued to widen, the Census Bureau
said.
   More than 31 million Americans, or 12.8% of the
population, lived in poverty last year, according to the
bureau -- a statistically insignificant drop from 13% in
1988, but a continuation of a six-year decline from 15.2% in
1983.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet the improvements have come during the longest
peacetime economic expansion in the country's history, and
some analysts believe progress should have been far greater.
   "After seven years of economic recovery, the poverty rate
was higher in 1989 than in any year of the 1970s, including
the deepest recession years of that decade," said Robert
Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a nonprofit organization that researches poverty
issues. In the recession year 1979, for example, the poverty
rate was 11.7%.
   "With the economy now running out of steam and a new
recession threatening, the poverty rate is likely to start
rising again," Mr. Greenstein said.
   The bureau's report also showed that the spoils of the
country's wealth were being shared less equitably than they
were the previous year and over the past few decades. The
richest fifth of American households held 46.8% of the
nation's income last year, compared with 46.3% in 1988, 44.2%
in 1979 and 43% in 1969.
   The poorest fifth of American households, meanwhile,
claimed 3.8% of the nation's income in 1989, unchanged from
1988, and a slightly smaller share than the 4.1% in both 1979
and 1969.
   The figures were based on a survey of 60,000 households.
The goverment's poverty threshold -- three times Agriculture
Department estimates of what a family spends on food -- was
$12,675 in 1989 compared with $12,091 in 1988.
   As in the past, far more black Americans than whites lived
in poverty. More than 30% of blacks fell below the poverty
line in 1989, a slight improvement from 31.3% in 1988, while
10% of whites were below the threshold, compared with 10.1%
in 1988. Hispanics also were disproportionately poor; 26.2%
lived in poverty last year, compared with 26.7% in 1988.
   Daniel Weinberg, the Census Bureau's chief of housing and
economic statistics, speculated that one reason black poverty
rates are so high is that "a large proportion of them live in
female-headed families."
   The department also said:
   -- After adjusting for inflation, median household income
rose 1.3% in 1989, to $28,910. Per-capita income grew 2.2% to
$14,060.
   -- Male earnings fell 1.8% last year, after adjusting for
inflation, while female earnings rose 1.8%.
   -- Four times as many children as elderly Americans lived
in poverty.

   Durable-Goods
   Orders Dropped
   0.8% in August

   Data on Personal Income,
   Spending Also Spur Fear
   Recession Is Imminent

   WASHINGTON -- In further signs that the economy
deteriorated in August, the government reported that orders
for heavy manufactured goods fell while growth in Americans'
personal incomes and spending failed to keep pace with
inflation.
   Orders to factories for durable goods -- so-called
big-ticket items such as cars and computers -- dropped 0.8%
in August despite a 12.4% jump in orders for defense
equipment, the Commerce Department said. Personal income
edged up only 0.3%, while personal spending grew 0.5%,
according to the department. After taking inflation into
account, spending was down 0.1%, and disposable personal
income was off 0.3%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The numbers are the latest in a string of bleak economic
statistics for August -- the month Iraq invaded Kuwait,
sending world oil prices soaring. Retail sales, industrial
production and housing construction all fell during the
month. The unemployment rate rose, and private industry
employment stayed flat.
   A growing number of economists believe the economy is on
the verge of a recession, if not already in one. For many,
yesterday's reports reinforced that view.
   "The decline in durable-goods orders provides further
confirmation that the recession began in August," said Gordon
Richardson, an economist at the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   Not only did factories suffer a decline in new orders, but
their backlog of unfilled orders decreased for the second
time in three months. "That cushion is beginning to shrink,
and that's a bit of a worrisome thing," said Samuel Kahan,
chief financial economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago.
   The government reported Tuesday that the economy slowed to
a near-standstill in the second quarter. That was before oil
prices soared, and many analysts fear the burden of higher
energy costs on businesses and consumers will push the
economy into a downturn after almost eight years of
expansion.
   But some economists were encouraged by the personal
spending figures, even though the 0.5% gain in August failed
to keep up with inflation and was smaller than July's 0.6%
rise and June's 1.2% increase.
   "The dire concerns people had was as soon as oil prices
started skyrocketing, consumers would pull back spending
immensely," Mr. Kahan said, citing surveys showing a plunge
in consumer confidence in the aftermath of Iraq's invasion.
"But actual spending seems to be holding up. It's not strong,
but it's holding up better than some of the doomsday-sayers
feared. I think the numbers are more consistent with an
economy that is virtually at zero."
   Because spending outstripped income growth, Americans'
saving rate dropped to 4.3% of disposable income -- the
lowest level in nearly a year. In July, the saving rate was
4.5%, and in June it was 4.6%.
   Overall, durable-goods orders totaled $127 billion in
August, compared with $128.05 billion the month before.
August's fall followed a 2.7% rise in orders in July, which
came after a 3.1% decline in June.
   Durable-goods orders generally have followed a jagged path
this year, rising one month only to fall the next. The
zigzags have left orders only 1.1% above where they stood a
year ago, according to the Commerce Department.
   In August, orders for transportation equipment rose 1.3%,
after jumping 4.5% in July and tumbling 6.3% in June, with
orders for cars, ships and tanks growing, and orders for
aircraft falling.
   Orders for primary metals dropped 1.7%, after rising 2.8%
in July. Orders for nonelectrical machinery -- a category
that includes computers -- plunged 6.1%, after growing 3.5%
in July. Orders for electrical machinery grew 2.6% on top of
a 1.5% gain in July.
   Capital goods orders outside of military equipment -- a
good barometer of business investment plans -- tumbled 11.2%,
after jumping 10.1% in July.
   Figures for the reports were adjusted for regular seasonal
fluctuations.
                                                                                                       

   Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on
personal income. The figures are at seasonally adjusted
annual rates in trillions of dollars.

Co. subsidiary, a maker of injection molded plastic and
rubber battery containers and accessories, and that it
engaged Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. to assist in the
sale.
   In 1989, Richardson had sales of $66.3 million. Witco had
sales of $798 million for the six months ended June 30. A
Witco spokesman said the Richardson business, part of an
acquisition made in the early 1980s, "doesn't fit our
strategic core businesses" and might be more appropriate for
a battery maker or injection molding company.

   Bid to Limit Terms of Office in California
   May Win Support of GOP Heavyweights

   SAN DIEGO -- Leading California Republicans are seriously
thinking about endorsing a ballot proposal that would limit
the time elected officials can spend in office.
   U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate for
governor, won't actually say he'll endorse such a proposal,
but he smiles knowingly when asked about it. "It's too early
to tell," he says. His aides privately suggest he'll do it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Outgoing GOP Gov. George Deukmejian is also getting ready
to take a stand. Insiders say he too will support a
term-limitation proposal as "a final slap" at Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, his Democratic nemesis during the
governor's eight years in office.
   If these leading Republicans climb aboard, it would give
added impetus to an idea that is beginning to sweep across
the country. Earlier this month Oklahoma voters, by a margin
of more than two to one, approved a constitutional amendment
barring future members of their Legislature from serving more
than 12 years in office. A similar proposal is on the
November ballot in Colorado.
   Speaker Brown, one of California's leading rainmakers, is
busily raising as much as $5 million for television ads aimed
at defeating the term-limitation idea. He argues that
"sleazy, cold-blooded special interests" are supporting the
initiatives because, if passed, lobbyists would dominate
"inexperienced rookie" officeholders. Mr. Brown has been an
assemblyman for 26 years and speaker for 10.
   There are actually two term-limitation proposals on the
Nov. 6 ballot and so far both parties have kept their
distance, mindful that if either proposal should be approved
by the voters, incumbents on both sides of the aisle would
face political extinction.
   There's no chance Democrats -- whose ticket is led this
year by their candidate for governor, former San Francisco
mayor Dianne Feinstein -- will support either proposal. They
have too much to lose. But for the Republicans, badly
outnumbered by Democratic officeholders, it's hard to resist.
They can't help but note that each of the term-limitation
proposals is drawing more than a 65% approval rating in the
public-opinion polls (but at a time when Speaker Brown's TV
ads have yet to go on the air).
   The proposal they're getting ready to support is called
Proposition 140, one of 28 complicated initiatives on the
ballot. It would limit statewide officeholders and state
senators to two consecutive four-year terms. Members of the
Assembly would be forced to step down after three two-year
terms. Their goodbyes would be final, for they could never
seek the same office again. "It's a lifetime ban," says
Speaker Brown. "You can get convicted of a felony and not
have a lifetime ban."
   The proposition, the brainchild of Los Angeles County
Supervisor Peter Schabarum, would also strip $70 million from
the state Legislature's $190 million budget and reduce the
members' pension benefits.
   The second proposal, Proposition 131, isn't quite so
Draconian. It would limit statewide officials to two
four-year terms, state senators to three four-year terms, and
members of the Assembly to six two-year terms. But
officeholders wouldn't have to give it all up forever under
131; after serving their maximum time, they could sit out a
term and then run again.
   Sen. Wilson and other leading GOP officials say they can't
support 131 because it introduces voluntary public funding
for candidates eligible to receive matching funds, and limits
spending by those who choose to accept public financing. It
also establishes a special prosecutor's office to investigate
campaign-law violations, a provision unnerving to some
politicians.
   Proposition 131 is the brainchild of Attorney General John
Van de Kamp, who lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary to
Ms. Feinstein, and is supported by consumer advocate Ralph
Nader and Common Cause, the self-styled citizens lobby.
   For Mr. Wilson, who has been running a tough, hard-hitting
campaign that has put his rival, Ms. Feinstein, on the
defensive, an endorsement of Proposition 140 would give his
effort a high-road, ethical tone that has been noticeably
missing so far. It would help blunt Ms. Feinstein's best
claim -- that she is the agent of change.
   Sen. Wilson likes the idea of embarrassing Speaker Brown.
He notes, with undisguised pleasure, that the TV pictures of
Mr. Brown arriving by limousine the other night at a Beverly
Hills hotel for a $10,000-a-table fund-raiser to defeat the
term-limitation proposals weren't pretty. "It did not
represent a good night for Willie," says Mr. Wilson.
   Mr. Brown's problem is coming up with a convincing
argument to defeat the initiatives. The polls suggest the
weakest argument is the one he's using -- that hardened
special-interest lobbyists would make mincemeat of rookie
legislators. The most compelling argument, the polls say, is
that the best way to get rid of offending politicians is to
vote them out of office. But defenders of the two initiatives
answer that by noting that incumbents won 97% of the Senate
and Assembly races they entered in 1988.
   Sen. Wilson's people also like the fact that the two
initiatives are diverting Speaker Brown and other leading
Democrats from taking a significant role in Ms. Feinstein's
campaign. "Willie's got to beat these two initiatives," says
George Gorton, Sen. Wilson's campaign manager. "It means
Dianne Feinstein's biggest hope is busy when she needs him
most."

   Quarterly Payout,
   Defers Deliveries

   USAir Group Inc. suspended its quarterly dividend and
deferred delivery of 16 new Boeing Co. jets for several years
in an effort to get its balance sheet and growth plans in
order.
   The Arlington, Va., airline holding company said its board
decided yesterday to suspend its quarterly three cents a
share dividend for "an indefinite period."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Industry analysts have expressed concern about USAir for
some weeks as its already-huge operating costs have swollen
in the wake of skyrocketing jet fuel costs, its
second-largest expense after labor.
   The company is considered more vulnerable to an economic
downturn because of existing operational and customer service
problems. Those largely resulted from difficulties merging
with Piedmont Aviation Inc. last year.
   In a statement, USAir Chairman Edwin I. Colodny said the
board decided to suspend the dividend "in light of the
company's recent financial performance and the poor outlook
for the nation's economy and its effect on air travel."
   Mr. Colodny said the company would be "conserving funds to
meet the company's ongoing capital needs."
   USAir yesterday also released details of how it plans to
cut its capital plans. USAir said it is delaying delivery of
14 Boeing 737s and two 767s that it was supposed to start
getting next year. The 737 is a narrow-body, mid-range plane.
The 767 is a wide-body, long-range plane.
   Of the 16 planes that it's deferring, USAir said it will
postpone delivery of one 767 to 1994 from 1992. The other 767
is being delayed to 1993 from 1992.
   Delivery of the 737s is also being delayed to 1993 and
1994 from 1991 and 1992.
   USAir executives foreshadowed the delivery delays several
weeks ago when they moved to cut the airline's capacity
growth to a maximum of 2% from 6%, as compared to this year,
and lay off 3,600 employees, or 7% of its work force of
54,000. Many employees say morale at the company has slumped
in recent days as a result of the moves.
   As a precursor to the capacity reduction, USAir in June
laid plans to postpone delivery of another dozen Boeing 737s
to 1995 from 1991 and 1992.
   The company yesterday indicated it is willing to commit to
more planes some years down the road. It said agreed with
Boeing to convert 10 existing options for 737s into firm
orders that would be delivered in 1994.
   Before the suspension of its dividend, USAir's payout was
already low relative to its rivals. UAL Corp., parent firm of
United Airlines has a quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share.
Even cash-strapped Pan Am Corp., which owns Pan American
World Airways, had a larger quarterly payment of 10 cents a
share.
   In his statement, Mr. Colodny acknowledged that the
company's dividend was "comparatively modest."
   Because its dividend is only three cents a share, it
doesn't appear as if the suspension will save the company a
lot of money. USAir had 44.5 million shares outstanding as of
June 30.
   USAir announced its actions after the close of trading
yesterday.In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, USAir shares closed at $16, down 50 cents.
   The company said it's also putting up for sale 28 old
Boeing 727-200 planes and 21 Boeing 737-200s between now and
1992. Those aircraft are considered fuel-guzzlers that would
cost USAir a lot of money to operate if fuel costs continue
to rise.
   In the weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait, industry observers
have said that they expect carriers such as USAir to shelve
their less-fuel efficient planes in an attempt to combat
rising fuel costs.
   A suspension of dividends wasn't one of the strategies,
however, that Wall Street analysts expected airlines to use
to combat their cost squeeze. Pan Am, for example, has
already taken the anticipated course of reducing capacity and
laying off employees.

   UAL Corp. and Pan Am Corp. don't pay quarterly dividends.
An earlier edition incorrectly cited quarterly dividend
figures that currently aren't being paid by the companies.

Strategic Petroleum Reserve to rein in surging crude prices.
Bush, who until recently had opposed tapping the supply,
called the draw-down a "test." The administration intends to

   Small Businesses
   Fight Untaxed Rivals

   SMALL BUSINESS, sick and tired of competition from
tax-exempt groups and government agencies, is turning to the
states for relief.
   Congress has wrestled for years with the issue of business
activity by universities, churches, hospitals, museums and
the like. But it hasn't been able to agree on what action to
take. Small businesses want to discourage tax-free
organizations from selling goods and services not directly
related to their charitable purpose at below-market prices.
Nonprofit groups have vigorously fought such a restraint.
   With no federal bills emerging, the Washington-based
Business Coalition for Fair Competition, a coalition of 31
small-business trade groups, is circulating a 27-page model
bill to state legislatures. Many legislatures will begin new
sessions in January. Arizona, Colorado and Iowa have enacted
laws to discourage activities by government agencies, but
their statutes lack enforcement powers and don't cover
nonprofit groups.
   The model bill would make it state policy for government
agencies to refrain from competing with small business, and
would set up a panel with authority to force agencies to end
anti-competitive practices. The bill would also force
nonprofit groups to pay business and property taxes when they
compete with for-profit concerns, and would limit their
commercial activities.
   "With nonprofit groups, it's a little stickier," says
Theresa Stanion, who is the coalition's director. "I don't
think we can get nonprofits out of commercial activities. We
just want them to pay their taxes."
                                                                                                       

   Financing Floats In
   For Fish Farming
                                                                                                       

   AQUACULTURE is going swimmingly, some investors and
venture capitalists believe.
   Enthusiasts see a bright future in the cultivation of
seafood and plants in ponds, tanks and coastal-water pens
because sea catches can't keep up with the world's appetite
for fish and crustaceans. And increasingly, hard-nosed
managers are entering a field previously dominated by rice
farmers and marine biologists.
   Binghamton, N.Y., businessman Ara Kradjian and several
partners invested $5.5 million to start Naiad Corp. of
Liverpool, Texas, this year. President Tom Farrell says Naiad
is talking to venture capitalists about a possible $2 million
infusion.
   "We're looking for a more market-driven approach" than the
typical farmers' cooperative, Mr. Farrell says.
   While farmers often just grow and sell their fish, Naiad
does everything, growing catfish (and, soon, redfish, striped
bass and tilapia), processing it and marketing it. It expects
to finish building ponds on 4,000 acres in 1991, and
forecasts revenue will rise to more than $30 million within
three years from $13 million in its current start-up year.
   Andrew Davlin, publisher of The Aquaculture Industry
newsletter in Pauma Valley, Calif., says aquaculture has been
growing at between 20% and 25% a year in the U.S. and at 10%
worldwide in recent years. U.S. catfish production has soared
to 360 million pounds in the latest 12 months from one
million pounds annually in the 1960s, he says.
   "Professional people are coming in with marketing and
business know-how," Mr. Davlin says, attracting venture
capitalists. An early breakthrough: a $12 million investment
from eight venture-capital firms of Aqua Group of Clearwater,
Fla., in March 1989.
                                                                                                       

   More Entrepreneurs
   Opt to Own, Not Lease
                                                                                                       

   INCREASING numbers of small-business owners are opting to
own rather than lease office space. "The small-business
person almost has to buy" at some point, says John Mattimoe,
the Small Business Administration's assistant administrator
for finance and investment in California, as well as four
other Western states.
   The SBA, through direct loans and loan guarantees, is a
major player in small-business office purchases. Mr. Mattimoe
says that so far this fiscal year his region, the SBA's
biggest, has approved 2,825 loans, about 12% more than in the
comparable 1989 period. He says about 60% of those loans --
forming a substantial part of the increase -- were for the
purchase of office space and other business facilities.
   One company that switched is Arrowhead General Insurance
Agency of San Diego. Patrick Kilkenny, chairman and principal
owner, says Arrowhead had been renting for seven years before
buying a 13,000-square-foot headquarters a few months ago. He
says his company will be paying "much less" as an owner.
(Developers and brokers, however, caution that ownership
doesn't usually bring substantial savings right away.)
   SBA rules allow buyers to put down 10% of the purchase
price of business real estate, with banks and the agency
financing the rest through a 25-year note. Bankers say they
like such loans because federal guarantees protect them.
   Ownership offers tax advantages, bankers say.
Entrepreneurs who put the building in their name can deduct
interest and depreciation expenses on their tax returns. The
company pays rent, which it can deduct on the corporate tax
return.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   OF 1,500 entrepreneurs asked in mid-August by United Group
Information Services of Hurst, Texas, whether they thought
the U.S. is entering a prolonged recession, 43.1% said no and
42.5% said yes. . . . Only 8.5% of U.S. companies with fewer
than 100 employees export, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
That's up slightly from 8% in 1988, when a previous survey
was made.

   Federal Paper Board Co. reported substantially lower
fiscal third-quarter earnings, citing problems in a paper
mill expansion project.
   The Montvale, N.J., pulp and paper maker said net income
for the 12-week quarter ended Sept. 8 was $21.9 million, or
48 cents a share, down 55% from $49.1 million, or $1.06 a

   For the 36 weeks ended Sept. 8, the company reported net
of $95.3 million, or $2.07 a share, down 35% from $147.6
million, or $3.22 a share. Sales rose 4.4% to $928.2 million.
   Federal Paper Board said operating earnings were hurt by a
series of mechanical difficulties mostly related to the
expansion project at its mills. It also noted a
12-cent-a-share non-cash charge for the retirement of assets
associated with the expansion project and a decline in market
prices for paper pulp.

to $7 million, or seven cents to eight cents a share, Dr.

   Kinetic Concepts expects net income of $1 million to $1.5

quarter, compared with $6 million, or 12 cents a share, a
year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue is expected to rise 32% to $59 million to $60
million from $44.6 million, the company said, largely as a
result of the acquisition July 2 of Medirec Inc., a Utah
medical rental concern with $50 million in annual sales.
   The layoffs address excess capacity in the national
network of 150 service centers and at headquarters in San
Antonio. The retrenchment will account for $1 million to $2
million of the charges.
   For the nine months, earnings will be about $13 million,
or 25 cents to 26 cents a share, compared with $18.9 million,
or 38 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said.
Revenue will rise to about $155 million from $130 million, it
added.

   Raises $500 Million

   NEW YORK -- Salomon Brothers Inc. said it raised $500
million for what it called a "low risk" fund that will seek
to profit from currency-rate changes as Europe moves toward
its 1992 unification.
   The securities firm's EMS Strategies Fund is Wall Street's
latest attempt to sell products that are geared toward the
unification of the 12-nation European Community in 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Executives at the Salomon Inc. unit said they were
somewhat surprised to be able to raise $500 million from
institutional investors in the currently skittish markets.
(The money was raised privately over the past three months.)
But they explained that the EMS fund was marketed as a
conservative alternative to high-yield, high-risk
instruments, such as junk-bond funds, that have soured over
the past year.
   The EMS fund, unlike typical currency funds that promise
yields of 25% to 30%, might not be able to return much more
than 9.5% because it won't be highly leveraged, Salomon
executives said. But clients are satisfied because it's a
"risk-averse world" right now, said Peter Taggart, the fund's
manager.
   Rather than dealing in world-wide currencies, Salomon
said, it will buy and sell only the currencies of EMS
markets, as the European Community attempts to establish a
single currency. The fund can make money by trading
currencies that briefly move out of line with the intended
EMS target, Salomon said.
   "The risk is laid off mostly to the central banks because
they are going to have to get the currencies in line as we
move to 1992," said Michael Holland, head of Salomon's
money-management unit, the fund's adviser, which manages more
than $6 billion.
   The EMS fund's base will be a portfolio of short-term U.S.
government bonds.
   Eventually, if all the European currencies are united, the
Salomon fund must be dissolved because opportunities to
profit from fluctuations won't exist. But no one expects the
EC to unify all the currencies in 1992. Salomon said that its
fund may not have to be wound down for four to six years.

   Report Lashes Out
   At the Big Board's
   Specialist System

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
</GV>
<LP>
   A new congressional report blasts the New York Stock
Exchange specialist system as too restrictive and urges
Congress to push the Securities and Exchange Commission to
re-examine exchange rules.
   The report, to be released today by the congressional
Office of Technology Assessment, doubts the international
competitiveness of the U.S. securities markets unless the SEC
rejects the monopolies created by the Big Board's so-called
Rule 390, which allows only specialists to make markets in
stocks. The issue goes directly to the heart of the Big
Board's trading system, focusing on the market makers who are
the exchange's buyers of last resort.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Calling Rule 390 "increasingly burdensome" in an age of
global securities trading, the panel suggests the SEC
reconsider a 1979 decision that allowed the rule to continue
in operation. "The SEC has been criticized for this hands-off
attitude toward Rule 390," the report says. "Congress may
soon find it necessary to direct the SEC to reconsider."
   The OTA is a bipartisan investigative body that studies
technological issues for both houses of Congress. Its reports
carry little weight on their own but can force major change
if the ideas are pushed by Congress.
   If the SEC were to repeal Rule 390 -- considered an
unlikely scenario -- any exchange member could become a
market maker in any stock. That, in turn, could create a
system of trading that resembles the over-the-counter
markets. Moreover, it could accelerate electronic,
screen-based trading systems, which some critics of the
status quo say need to be an integral part of 21st century
trading.
   Richard Torrenzano, a spokesman for the Big Board, said
exchange officials hadn't yet seen the report and, therefore,
declined to comment on specifics. However, he said, "The
record of the past couple of years shows that specialists as
dealers have outperformed any other dealer system in the
world."
   He cited the October 1989 stock-market "mini-crash" when
the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points in
slightly more than an hour. At that time, specialists
"continued to trade and maintain fair and orderly markets
when many other markets were either closed or not
accessible," Mr. Torrenzano said.
   The SEC declined to comment.
   The study reopens the issue of the specialist system,
which has perplexed regulators for nearly two decades. In a
1975 hearing about Rule 390, the SEC found such restrictions
"impose burdens on competition" and that these burdens
weren't "necessary or appropriate for protection of
investors." The agency then proposed repealing Rule 390. But
after four years of debate, the commission withdrew its
proposal.
   The report also contends that even recent moves to require
higher capital levels for specialists "will still probably be
inadequate on days when volume peaks and huge order
imbalances appear."
   But specialists rebut that argument. "Specialists' capital
and the ability to stop crashes have nothing to do with each
other," said one market maker. "There isn't enough capital in
the world to stop a crash."
   Another specialist, Robert Fagenson, executive vice
president at Fagenson &amp; Co., said that specialists' capital
has grown since the 1987 crash, whereas overall capital on
Wall Street's trading desks has decreased. Moreover, recent
volatility in the market has "increased the importance of
auction market and agency trading of stocks, such as you find
on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange," he said.

   A finance official of the state-controlled group said that
one of the main elements behind the drop was a lower
contribution from minority-held units, essentially in the
finance sector. She said these operations generated only 525
million francs of profit in the first half, down from their
unusually strong year-earlier contribution of 825 million
francs.

   UnionFed Financial Corp. said it will restate its fiscal
year 1990 results and report "a significant loss" compared
with previously reported profit of $11.1 million, or $1.60 a
share, in the year ended June 30.
   The restatement is due mainly to "substantial additional
provisions for possible losses on loans and real estate" made
"in connection with current examinations" of Union Federal
Savings Bank by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the company said. Union
Federal Savings, the principal subsidiary of Brea,
Calif.-based UnionFed, has 27 branches in Southern
California.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Additional loss reserves are needed because of a "further
deterioration in real estate markets and a significantly more
conservative approach to valuations of real estate and real
estate secured loans . . . based in part on more conservative
federal regulatory valuation estimates and assumptions,"
UnionFed said in a brief statement issued Tuesday night.
   Company executives were in meetings yesterday and weren't
available to discuss the expected size of the loss or to
answer any other questions.
   UnionFed shares lost almost half their market value
yesterday, skidding $2.25 to $2.50 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have plummeted from a high of
$19.50 this year.

   Dana Corp. of Toledo, Ohio, said it was taking a $10
million charge to increase the loan-loss reserves of its
Diamond Savings &amp; Loan subsidiary.
   The action will decrease Dana's earnings for the first
nine months by about 12%, the company said. That indicates
that the company expected to earn roughly $83 million for the
first nine months before the charge and now expects to earn
about $73 million. For the first three quarters of 1989, Dana
earned $111.4 million, or $2.73 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the charge, Dana Chairman Southwood J. Morcott
said he was "pleased with our operating performance given
these turbulent times."
   In addition, Dana said it might have to inject up to $33
million in additional capital over the next year into Diamond
to cause it to exceed all of the increased regulatory capital
requirements. This action would have no effect on Dana's
profits, said Robert Richter, Dana's controller. Mr. Richter
noted that Diamond could take several other steps to meet the
capital requirements, and that the injection of capital was a
last resort.

   NEW YORK -- The abandoned Shoreham nuclear power plant on
Long Island could profitably be converted to a natural-gas
facility, according to a study for the state agency that will
take over the facility.
   The plant, which was built by Long Island Lighting Co. but
mothballed when state officials refused to give necessary
clearances, is scheduled to be sold by Lilco for $1 to the
Long Island Power Authority. The study concludes that rather
than let the plant sit and crumble, it could be converted to
a gas-fired generating facility.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the power authority, said a
final decision on converting Shoreham could be reached by
next year. According to the study, Shoreham could be
converted to a nonnuclear unit for less than it would cost to
build a new plant at a new site.
   Depending on a number of factors, the study said it would
cost about $715 million to convert Shoreham to a
1,351-megawatt natural gas-fired facility. The power
authority would have various financing options, ranging from
doing the conversion itself to farming it out.
   After costing some $5.2 billion to build, the Shoreham
plant was forced to close because local opposition prevented
Lilco from meeting emergency standards for evacuation
procedures. Such procedures for the area were necessary in
the event of a nuclear disaster.

   Du Pont Co., which has interests in chemicals, fibers and

grinding and packaging of titanium dioxide pigment, an
essential part of paint, plastics, paper and other products.
   The Wilmington, Del., company declined to disclose the
size of the investment. The plant in Uberaba, about 200 miles
north of Sao Paolo, is expected to begin operating in late
1991 and to serve the Brazilian market. Du Pont said the
plant is being built on a company-owned, 235-acre site with
ample space for constructing additional processing units
later. Plans call for developing the site into a full-scale
manufacturing plant by the mid-1990s.

   Du Pont is the world's largest producer of titanium
dioxide. Its titanium dioxide plants in the U.S. and Mexico
have a combined annual capacity of more than 700,000 metric
tons. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

completed its acquisition of Tony Lama Co. for $9 a share, or
$18 million, with 97% of the El Paso, Texas, boot maker's

shares closed at $8.50, down 25 cents.

   The deal, in which Justin also assumed $34 million of Lama
debt, is a setback for dissident holders seeking to acquire
Justin. The dissident group had sued, seeking, among other
things, to block the Lama deal, but a U.S. judge in Fort
Worth denied the request Monday. The group Tuesday launched
an $18-a-share tender offer for 6.2 million Justin shares, to
boost its stake to 78% from about 12%. Justin shares ended
unchanged at $15 in national OTC trading. The group said its
offer would have been $20 a share but for the Lama
acquisition, which they contend lowers Justin's value. Lama
had a 1989 loss of $1.8 million, or 95 cents a share, on
sales of $75.6 million.

   LOS ANGELES -- California air-quality regulators today
will consider adopting the toughest smog laws in the country,
requiring automobile makers and oil companies to produce
lower-air-polluting cars and cleaner-burning fuels beginning
in 1994.
   In a two-day session that's being closely watched by the
auto and oil industries, the California Air Resources Board
will rule on proposals that would, among other things:
require car makers to produce electric cars by 1998; set the
nation's first standards for so-called "reformulated"
gasolines; and require gas stations to offer cleaner
alternative fuels, including methanol and compressed natural
gas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   California, which has more smog than the rest of the
nation combined, is the only state with emissions standards
independent of those set by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency. Observers say the new standards, if
adopted by the Air Resources Board, could lead the way for
the rest of the country.
   But the new standards aren't likely to be adopted without
considerable opposition from businesses interests. "We think
the regulations for low-emissions vehicles are going a little
far," said a spokesman for Chrysler Corp., one of the several
auto makers that will testify at today's hearings. Dixon
Smith, general manager for strategic planning and business
evaluation at Chevron Corp.'s Chevron U.S.A. unit, said, "We
strongly object to the regulations that would mandate
gasoline suppliers sell specific volumes of alternative fuels
whether customers want them or not."

<TEXT>
   AFTER A 7 A.M.-TO-3:30 P.M. DAY as a telephone-systems
assistant at Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co., Betty Flood
returns to her Newark, N.J., apartment and starts a second
job. It doesn't pay, the hours are terrible and the noise can
be deafening. The 56-year-old Ms. Flood wouldn't have it any
other way.
   Betty Flood runs her own game room/hang-out for the 254
children of the 540-unit apartment complex in which she
lives. Concerned by the number of children who didn't seem to
have a place to go after school, she started the project on
her own in 1978, using space donated by the building's
landlord. Despite open-heart surgery five years ago, she is
still going strong. "As long as I can keep a child from
roaming the streets, I'll stay right here," says Ms. Flood,
who, with four children and 21 grandchildren of her own, has
experience with growing children.
   To a visitor, Ms. Flood's center (it has no official name)
is a bedlam of TV blare, clicking billiard balls, clunking
hand-hockey pucks and shouts and squeals. But Ms. Flood,
whose own apartment is on the floor above, is in control from
the moment she greets her charges with a "Hi, baby, how ya
doin]" as they are signed in until she jots down their time
out (the center opens at 4:30 p.m. and usually closes by 11
p.m.; those under 13 years of age must go home by 8 p.m.).
   Should a youth become rowdy, Ms. Flood brings the offender
back in line by brandishing a hollow plastic toy baseball
bat. But that's as rough as it gets, and the posted rules --
such as "anyone cursing will be suspended for six weeks" --
are mostly obeyed. "When Betty Flood speaks, the kids
listen," says John Jenkins, principal of a nearby elementary
school. "She has the respect of all the kids in that complex
and they're better children for the experience."
   It's more than just a safe place to go after school. Ms.
Flood leads rap sessions with the youths, whose ages range
from a preschool four to a high school 18, and teaches them a
range of skills from reading to neat dressing to chess
playing. She organizes picnics, sponsored by her utility
employer and held in the complex's outside area, and stages
Easter egg hunts and Halloween parties.
   Neither Ms. Flood nor Charlotte Young, a volunteer
assistant, are paid for their efforts. Ms. Flood doesn't even
have an estimate of the annual costs of running the center,
which is supported by donations from local merchants and
other businesses.
   Fiori DePhillips, owner of the nearby Roseville Pharmacy
which is contributing about $300 to Ms. Flood's Halloween
party, has a high regard for Ms. Flood's work. "She helps
keep the kids off the streets and out of trouble and is
showing us how to get along and work together," he says.
   Although some local politicians have urged her to seek
public funding for her effort, she has declined. "If I took
state, federal or city funds, I would have to take in
children from other areas and I couldn't control them," she
says.
   Meanwhile, she's looking forward to January when her
center will move into a twice-as-large space at the complex
where there will be two bathrooms -- one for boys, one for
girls -- and a full-sized pool table given by Ms. Flood's
employer, PSE&amp;G. She sees no problem filling the new quarters
with active kids.

   Study by Panel
   On Integrity Tests
   Proves Inconclusive
   ----

   A long-awaited congressional study failed to resolve
whether written integrity tests can reliably predict
dishonest behavior. The move effectively offered a reprieve
to thousands of employers who want to keep using the
controversial tests.
   The study, by Congress's Office of Technology Assessment,
questioned the credibility of research supporting the tests
but didn't dismiss it. The result: a declaration that
available evidence isn't conclusive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Because it isn't overtly negative, the finding deprives
foes of the exams of ammunition and appears to lessen the
potential for an outright ban. Integrity test makers have
lobbied for months against an unfavorable finding, fearing
federal limits comparable to those passed two years ago
against most lie-detector tests.
   While hedging on the validity issue, the report urged
"further government attention" to concerns arising from
intrusive test questions, a lack of safeguards against the
misuse of test results and the fact that many honest people
are rejected from jobs because they fail the exams. The
report also urged further study to insure that the tests
don't discriminate against minorities and women.
   "Assuming even a modest error rate, widespread use of
integrity tests could deny opportunity to many individuals,"
the study said. It cited data showing that the number of
people "incorrectly identified" as dishonest on some tests
range as high as 97%.
   Such findings drew praise from the National Employment
Lawyers Association, a workers' rights group, which said
integrity tests should be banned because they can "smear
honest job applicants."
   But a group of the largest publishers of the tests, who
maintain that the exams are more effective than alternative
screening methods, assailed the study as "inaccurate and
without scientific merit." They termed supportive comments
from some experts in the report as "positive aspects," but
repeated previously reported assertions that the technology
office distorted data to bolster an anti-testing bias.
   Officials of the office have denied the charges but may
face close scrutiny when lawmakers hold hearings on the issue
early next year. Legislative proposals to protect the
privacy, legal rights and job chances of people who take the
tests are probable, congressional aides said. They wouldn't
rule out efforts to ban the tests but judged them less
likely, given the intensity of the publishers' efforts as
well as complex and conflicting evidence about whether the
tests work.

   U.S. Trust Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter

fourth-quarter net income to exceed the $4.4 million, or 44
cents a share, earned in the year-earlier quarter.

   H. Marshall Schwarz, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the special charges will improve operating results and

   The charges include $17.4 million associated with its
wholly owned software subsidiary, Financial Technologies
International, and $7.6 million associated with commercial
real estate loans remaining in its corporate loan portfolio.
U.S. Trust has been liquidating the portfolio since 1987.
   Separately, U.S. Trust said it agreed with International
Business Machines Corp. to form a joint venture to design and
market trust and global custody systems for financial

   MONTREAL -- North Korea and South Korea agreed in
principle to link their separate air-traffic control systems

border.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization said the two
Koreas, China and Japan agreed to a new, shorter air route
linking Tokyo and Beijing that will cross over both Koreas,
cutting a four-hour flight to about three hours. The
organization said about six airlines regularly fly the
Tokyo-Beijing route.

   Assad Kotaite, president of the aviation organization,

agreement impossible. "The political climate is much better
now," he said.
   Under the agreement, North Korean and South Korean
air-traffic controllers will for the first time talk to each
other regularly. The two countries will set up a permanent
voice link so that, as planes cross their border, a
controller in one Korea can "hand off" a flight to a
counterpart in the other Korea.
   All four countries involved will sign a memorandum of
understanding later this fall. The aviation organization also
will coordinate a meeting between North Korean and South
Korean officials to settle technical details, after which the
two nations will sign a separate operational agreement. The
organization said the new route could open by year end.

   Employer Sanctions
   In Immigration Law

   WASHINGTON -- A government task force voiced concern about
discrimination sparked by the employer-sanctions component of
the 1986 federal immigration law, but did not call for the
repeal of the provisions.
   In a report, the task force headed by John R. Dunne,
assistant attorney general for civil rights, recommended that
Congress approve stiffer fines and stronger enforcement
against employers who violate the law's anti-discrimination
provisions. It also called for better education of employers
and employees on the law's requirements, and simpler forms
and procedures for verifying an employee's work eligibility.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act was intended
to curb illegal immigration by imposing penalties against
employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers, and
requires them to check the work-authorization documents of
all employees hired. The federal General Accounting Office
found earlier this year that the sanctions had prompted a
"widespread pattern of discrimination" by employers against
job applicants who appeared foreign-born.
   The task force said it was "deeply concerned" about the
sanctions' discriminatory effects, but did not address
whether the measures should be repealed because that issue
should be decided by Congress.
   Minority and civil rights groups that have been lobbying
for repeal of sanctions were encouraged by the findings. "The
ball is in Congress' court" to repeal sanctions, said Cecilia
Munoz, a senior policy analyst with the National Council for
La Raza in Washington, D.C. "And it eliminates any lingering
doubts that sanctions cause discrimination."
   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Judiciary
Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, said the
recommendations weren't enough. "I'm skeptical that
safeguards such as those proposed by the task force can be
drawn tightly enough to end discrimination," he said.
Instead, he said he would continue to seek repeal of the
sanctions "because they are discriminatory against Hispanic
Americans, Asian Americans and other ethnic minorities."

   Booz-Allen wanted a more sophisticated image for its
computer-systems design group. But the consulting firm had
trouble explaining, much less marketing, its new service,
known less-than-snappily as "Strategy Driven Systems."
   The solution: An artist designed six hanging sculptures
representing key aspects of the system. Little curved
enameled pipes, for example, depict its flexibility. A
brochure featuring these mobiles will go to new clients.
Cooking up a flashy brochure took some doing, says Raymond
Lane, a senior vice president at Booz-Allen, Hamilton Inc.
"It has to say something to senior management."

   Mobiles aren't exactly Madison Avenue. But Booz-Allen's
artistic efforts illustrate the struggles that face
management consulting companies as they try to beef up their
images.
   The most competitive consulting market in years -- some
say ever -- is pushing once-reticent consulting firms into
unfamiliar marketing territory.
   Companies that once ducked the limelight now hire
publicists, solicit testimonials from clients, sponsor
conferences and cozy up to journalists. Some bury academic
journals under a blizzard of papers. At least one firm has
even turned to television advertising.
   But rocks dot the road to fame. Some companies find it
hard to explain what they do. (Typically, management
consultants for a fee help companies handle business problems
like plotting strategy, solving personnel problems or
redesigning manufacturing or marketing systems.) Several
claim the strongest resistance to their own marketing comes
from within their own firm. Others say old-time methods still
suit them just fine.
   "We don't make cold calls. We don't send fliers. We don't
send letters," asserts Frederick Gluck, managing director of
consultants McKinsey &amp; Co. He adds,"We don't need to do it.
We have all the work we can handle."
   Still, many firms think change is inevitable. "Management
consulting is becoming more a business and less a
profession," says Marvin Schiller, managing director, North
America, at A.T. Kearney Inc.
   One reason: the deteriorating economy, which is trimming
the consulting industry's double-digit growth rate of the
past five years. While many consulting firms still say
they're growing faster than ever, a number acknowledge their
growth rates have slowed substantially.
   Of 17 firms recently surveyed by Consultants News, a trade
publication, four reported decreases in first-half revenues
of between 10% and 25%; four had increases of less than 10%;
two showed unspecified growth; two wouldn't say; and only
five showed increases of more than 10%. "That's a big change
from what we have been used to hearing," says Managing Editor
David Lord.
   Also, some tough players are intensifying their battle for
a slice of today's market. The genteel Ivy League world of
strategy consulting increasingly is being attacked by
technological whizzes like Andersen Consulting, an offshoot
of accountants Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. Because of their roots
in the competitive accounting profession, companies like
Andersen have lots of experience in shootouts with rivals.
   "In the old days it was white-gloves competition," says
Carl Sloane, chairman of consultants Temple, Barker &amp;
Sloane/Strategic Planning Associates Inc. "You wouldn't even
hire someone from another firm without asking permission."
   Like doctors and lawyers, consultants have until very
recently viewed publicity as unseemly. While 60% of firms
sampled for a report released earlier this year by Britain's
Alpha Publications Ltd. depended on old-boy networks, only 3%
used advertising and 3% public relations consultants to
promote themselves. Consultants protected their clients'
confidences the way a psychiatrist might. "For the first 60
or 65 years {at Booz-Allen} you didn't talk to anyone," says
Mr. Lane. "You were the CEO's consultant, and the CEO didn't
want anyone to know he had a consultant."
   Today, buyers of consulting services are shopping around.
What's more, says Thomas Doorley III, managing partner of
Braxton Associates, "We may be consulting with a client who
is using a competitor. Ten years ago, that never happened."
   So testimonials from satisfied clients become more
important. In the past, Bain &amp; Co.'s policy was not to even
suggest a client's identity in public. Nowadays, it sometimes
seeks a client's approval to do so. Last year for the first
time, a brochure for Booz-Allen's information systems group
included names of clients.
   Here's how four well-known consulting companies are
adapting to the leaner, meaner years:
   -- In common with many other firms, Boston Consulting
Group Inc. must draw 20% of its work each year from new
business, and it's being "very aggressive," says John
Clarkeson, president and chief executive officer. Noting that
rivals are being unusually flexible in the terms they're
offering clients -- for example taking on smaller projects
than in the past -- Mr. Clarkeson suggests that his
associates "really {make} sure clients check our references"
and consider bringing in Boston Consulting's senior officials
and knowledgable executives based at faraway branches to help
clinch the deal.
   -- Bain: Companies that once sold their services on
reputation alone now find themselves struggling to define
specific products or areas of expertise. Bain has reorganized
into "practice areas" where it can offer expertise, such as
health care, services and information technology, banking,
marketing and manufacturing. Peter Dawkins, managing director
of North American operations, says Bain had been losing
"competitive bake-offs" because rivals marketed their
expertise in specific industries, while Bain didn't.
   -- At Braxton Associates these days, individual
consultants spend close to half of the time that they aren't
actually consulting on product-development work, compared
with about 25% two or three years ago. "New competitors pop
up all the time," says managing partner Thomas Doorley III.
"It forces us to be on our toes."
   -- A.T. Kearney, a firm that has traditionally focused on
logistics consulting, is now forming groups to develop
products in different specialties like information technology
and marketing. One new product is called "Stages of
Development." Says Mr. Schiller: It's a visual presentation
"of where a company stands in its business capability and
where it should be. In the past, it would be more a matter of
starting from a zero base and providing a tailored program to
the client."
   Developing products doesn't work, of course, if nobody
knows you have them. Firms that once dodged publicity now
court it. Earlier this year, Bain hired its first full-time
public-relations official, and Andersen Consulting last year
named its first time national public relations director.
Today, that official supervises a dozen people and two
outside public-relations firms. "Frenzy isn't too strong a
word" to describe the quest for advice, says a public
relations aide for one consulting firm.
   Noting their growing numbers, a group of New York-based
and Boston-based P.R. types working for consulting companies
last year formed a group they call the Breakfast Club.
Members meet every two months and talk about seminars, book
publishing, ads.
   One strategy sparks lots of debate among consultants:
using television ads. Andersen Consulting, which specializes
in information technology and consulting in computer systems,
uses TV as part of an "image campaign" that began last year.
This year, the firm is budgeting $10 million for ads.
   Andersen's ads -- including shots of a computer mouse
being manipulated by a real one -- hit an industry
unaccustomed to such directness like a bomb. Booz-Allen's
position probably represents that of most competitors: "We
are thinking about it, but we aren't doing it," says Mr. Lane
at Booz-Allen. Why not? "We're snobs," he says. "We like to
stay above the fray."
   Even at Andersen, says A. George Battle, the company's
managing partner in charge of market devlopment, "It's an
interesting cultural shift to work in an area many people
think of as slightly sleazy." In the first year, 60 people
had to approve the ads. "It felt like the gestation of an
elephant."
   Many expect, however, that if the economy tightens
further, competition will only intensify. "When I got into
the business, all you needed to consult was a blue serge
suit, an air-travel card and a Harvard MBA," mourns Mr.
Sloane at Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane.

   Trump Shuttle May Go
   On Sale Again, Lenders Say

   NEW YORK -- The Trump Shuttle, which has been on and off
the market once this year, may soon be up for sale again.
   Some of Donald Trump's bankers, holding $245 million in
senior Shuttle debt, suggested that Mr. Trump sell the
airline rather than lose money operating it, according to
people who attended a meeting of Shuttle lenders yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the banks do not expect the Shuttle to sell for
anything close to what Mr. Trump paid for it, some of them --
including lead lender Citibank -- said in the meeting that it
would be better to cut the banks' losses and sell the airline
anyway.
   Mr. Trump borrowed $380 million to pay for what was the
Eastern Shuttle last year. Under last month's $65 million
bank bailout, interest on $135 million of Mr. Trump's Shuttle
debt was suspended. Last week, Mr. Trump told his bankers
that soaring fuel costs and a declining northeast economy
would cause him to miss interest payments on the senior $245
million loan, as well.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is ready to back away from
his insistence that the capital gains tax rate be cut, top
congressional Republicans suggested after a White House
meeting.
   "He might be willing to compromise on capital-gains
taxes," which have been one of the main sticking-points in
the budget talks, said Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole
of Kansas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bush himself, questioned by reporters aboard Air Force
One later in the day, wouldn't say if his stance has changed.
"The Republicans know what I want when I talk about growth,"
he said.
   Sen. Dole and Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the
second-ranking House Republican, said the president is
willing to consider alternatives to a capital-gains cut as a
tax incentive for economic growth. The two GOP leaders
mentioned such modest alternatives as tax breaks for research
and development and tax-favored enterprise zones, ideas that
many Democrats already support.
   Budget negotiators have been casting about for a way to
narrow the tax bite on the sale of assets other than a
straight cut in rates. Negotiators have discussed such
alternatives as sticking with the curent rate but applying it
only to gains in excess of inflation; cutting the rate only
for profits on new investments, and limiting the lower rate
to investments in startup companies.
   Democrats charge that the president's insistence on
reducing capital-gains taxes is a major obstacle to reaching
a deficit-reduction compromise. Republicans counter that
other issues also remain unresolved, including ways to
restrain government benefit programs.
   On that score, lawmakers said that negotiators have
discussed ways to trim Social Security spending in the latest
round of closed-door talks. "It's achieved a new level of
seriousness," said one Democratic aide.
   Democrats have argued for taxing away more of the benefits
paid to upper-income Americans while Republicans lean toward
a delay in cost-of-living adjustments, the aides said.
   But negotiators still haven't come to any final agreement
on how to restrain benefit programs, one of the stickiest
issues in talks. Any changes to Social Security are likely to
be politically explosive -- particularly with all the recent
attention devoted to the growing surplus in the Social
Security trust fund.
   As negotiators -- five top congressional leaders and three
administration officials -- resumed their closed-door talks
in the Capitol, Mr. Bush took the offensive.
   "All through the talks, for 135 long days, time and again
I've gone the extra mile. . . . And each time the other side
has said, `It's still your move,'" the president charged
during a campaign stop in Ohio. "If and when the ax falls,
the Democratic Congress knows that it will be held
accountable and I will take that message to every state in
the union," he warned. "It is their fault. . . ."
   The president's words, after weeks of conciliatory
comments, seemed to suggest that negotiators still weren't
near an accord just four days before fiscal 1991 begins
Monday. On that date, the government faces a shutdown or $85
billion in crippling, automatic spending cuts.
   Mr. Bush's broadside also reflected the feeling of
congressional Republicans that Democrats have been winning
the publicrelations battle. "One of the things the president
has been doing wrong is he's been hammering the Congress --
not the Democrats in Congress," said Rep. Mickey Edwards (R.,
Okla.), who attended yesterday's White House meeting. "We
decided it was time for him to really hit the Democrats
hard."
   But Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said, "The
irony of the president's statement is we thought we were
making progress." House Speaker Thomas Foley said Democrats
won't let the partisan speech critically damage the talks.
   Yesterday, Speaker Foley postponed action on an emergency
spending resolution to keep the government funded for the
first weeks of the new fiscal year. Democratic leaders wanted
to avoid a divisive vote on a provision that would postpone
the spending cuts required next week under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law. The leaders are plainly ambivalent
about trying to delay the cuts, given Mr. Bush's threat this
week to veto any waiver, and may postpone action until as
late as Sunday.
   If congressional and administration negotiators reach a
budget accord before Monday, then Congress and Mr. Bush are
likely to quickly enact a stopgap spending bill to keep the
government going and waive the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts.
   If there's no agreement, however, it isn't clear what
happens. If an emergency spending bill passes and is signed
by the president, then the Gramm-Rudman ax falls. About $85
billion of the sums appropriated by that bill are withheld,
and at least some agencies furlough employees.
   But there are other alternatives. If Congress and the
president can't even agree on the terms of an emergency
spending bill, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has
said the administration is preparing to rely on 1980 and 1981
opinions by President Carter's attorney general, Benjamin
Civiletti, to keep essential parts of the government going --
at least for a few days. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
said yesterday that the decade-old legal opinion "is held to
and subscribed to by this department," but that he hadn't
discussed its application with President Bush.
   President Reagan relied on the Civiletti opinion when the
federal government was without any spending authority for
four days in 1981. Many government facilities closed, but
air-traffic controllers stayed on the job, Social Security
checks were mailed and meat was inspected.
   Such a move would be controversial, however. "On the face
of it, this appears to be nothing more than a thinly veiled
attempt to selectively apply the sequester," said Sen. Robert
Byrd (W., Va), referring to the spending cuts mandated by the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   "I don't think the president has that authority," added
Rep. John Myers (R., Ind.). "Sununu is assuming a lot, but
then he doesn't think much of the Congress. Never has."
   As the talks have dragged on without success,
rank-and-file Democrats in the House are pressing harder for
a budget alternative that better reflects the party's
priorities if the talks break up. "This is going nowhere,"
said Rep. Richard Durbin (D., Ill.) after House Democrats
caucused yesterday. "There is no mutiny. There is nothing
like it, but some of us feel we have to move on to the next
step."
   The Senate voted yesterday to apply the automatic cuts to
the paychecks of members of Congress and top administration
officials. The law currently exempts them -- though not their
staffs -- from furlough or other direct hits.

   Industrials Drop 25.99 as Oil Prices
   Resume Climbing; MCA Is Strong

   NEW YORK -- The stock market lost more ground yesterday as
oil prices resumed their rise.
   Some softening of crude oil prices late in the afternoon
took the pressure off stock prices, which advanced from their
lows. Crude oil for November delivery settled to close with a
$1.14 rise at $38.67 a barrel.

   MCA ignited once again in the final half hour of trading
on rumors that Japan's Matsushita Electric is near finalizing
an agreement to acquire the entertainment conglomerate. MCA,
which had idled with a fractional gain for most of the day,
ended 7 1/4 higher at 61 1/4. The stock rocketed 19 1/2
Tuesday on word of the talks between the two concerns.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell to about a
40-point loss twice during the session, ended 25.99 points
lower at 2459.65.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 3.20 to 305.06, and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 1.68 to
167.52. The Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 2.96 to
282.33.
   Some 1,119 New York Stock Exchange stocks declined and 421
advanced.
   Big Board volume eased to a meager 155,570,000 shares,
down from Tuesday's 155,940,000.
   With the present stalemate between Iraq and most of the
industrialized world providing little news for the market to
trade on, traders have turned their attention to the federal
budget negotiations in Washington.
   Many market watchers say any movement in the deadlocked
talks could spark a short-term rally in stock prices.
   "Technically, stocks are very oversold here," said A.C.
Moore, director of research at Argus Research. "They will
respond favorably to any progress on the budget."
   Any bounce from these levels could catch some
unsophisticated investors by surprise. Thomas Gallagher,
managing director in charge of capital commitment at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said a lot of people who have no
experience shorting stock are selling borrowed shares with
abandon.
   So-called short sellers sell borrowed stock in hopes of
repaying their loans with cheaper shares when the market
falls.
   Mr. Moore isn't alone in looking for some relief from the
slump in stock prices. However, few are looking for a
sustainable advance.
   But Eric T. Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said that while stocks are "vulnerable to
a rally," any advance would still be couched in the context
of a bigger bear market. "I see no clear signs of a bottom,"
Mr. Miller asserted.
   Mr. Miller cautions that the continued decline in Japanese
stock prices, which has been largely ignored of late by
American investors, could hurt world markets by "giving extra
impetus to a world monetary squeeze."
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph topped the most-active list
with volume of more than 7.4 million shares. Traders said the
activity was related to the company's 33-cent quarterly
dividend. The stock will trade ex-dividend today. AT&amp;T eased
3/8 to 31 1/2.
   Entertainment stocks that followed MCA higher Tuesday
rallied again late yesterday along with MCA. Walt Disney rose
3/8 to 90 1/2, Paramount Communications gained 5/8 to 35 1/2
and Time Warner added 1 1/8 to 72.
   Citicorp slid 1 to 14 1/2. The company's Citibank unit
will soon lay off 100 workers in its leveraged-lending unit
and transfer hundreds of others, a senior official at the
bank said. Other Citibank business units in the U.S. are
expected to announce cutbacks internally over the next six to
eight weeks.
   UnionFed Financial fell 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 after announcing
that it will restate its June year profit to a "significant"
loss.
   Harris Corp. fell 4 1/4 to 21. The company said it expects
profit in the six months ending Dec. 30 to be "substantially
lower" than the $56.4 million, or $1.14 a share, posted in
the year-earlier period. The company cited the "rapid
deterioration in domestic semiconductor markets" as cause for
the bleak outlook.
   Raymond James Financial fell 5/8 to 15 5/8. The company
bought back 275,000 shares of its stock from a single
institutional buyer.
   Deere tumbled 3 3/8 to 45 3/8, a new 52-week low.
Yesterday, Wertheim Schroder lowered its fiscal 1991 earnings
estimates for the second time in two weeks. The securities
firm predicts that sales in three of the company's four
businesses will decline next year. Wertheim said revenue from
Deere's fourth and largest business probably will be flat
with the current fiscal year.
   AmBase rallied 1/4 to 1 3/4. The insurance holding company
said there weren't any corporate developments to account for
the activity in its stock.
   Dana lost 2 5/8 to 24. Late Tuesday the company said
profit for the first nine months of 1990 would be reduced by
about 12% due to certain adjustments at its Diamond Savings &amp;
Loan unit. Dana said the unit will increase its loan loss
reserves by $10 million, and will spin off certain loans and
real estate development projects to other Dana units.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index slid 3.11
to 310.06. Volume totaled 14,080,000 shares.
   Put warrants tied to the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei
225-Stock Average were among the most active Amex issues
again, climbing in anticipation of further losses in Japanese
stocks. Salomon Nikkei Stock Average Put Warrants added 1 7/8
to 20, while PaineWebber Group Nikkei Stock Average 4/8/93
Put Warrants rose 1 to 10 1/8. Various issues of Nikkei put
warrants have more than quadrupled in value since they were
first issued earlier this year.

   Holders of Thrifts' Debt
   Get Good News From RTC

   The Resolution Trust Corp. has good news for holders of
certain securities secured by now-bankrupt thrifts: Interest
on bonds backed by letters of credit redeemed early by the
RTC will be paid up to the time the securities are redeemed.
   The RTC has the power to repudiate bonds issued or secured
by now-insolvent thrifts, and redeem or "call" them early.
When this happens, the RTC says it will prepay "an amount
equal to the outstanding principal amount or accreted value
of the secured obligations."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last April the RTC adopted a policy of paying interest up
to the time the bonds were repudiated, and not just up to the
date that the thrift was taken over. But it left unclear
whether it would do the same for bonds secured by
"collateralized letters of credit" issued by the busted
thrifts. Because of this, holders of those securities worried
about the possibility of losing months' worth of interest if
the bonds were called.
   About $840 million of collaterized letters of credit were
issued by thrifts currently in conservatorship, estimates
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. In most cases, the letters of credit
were issued by thrifts to secure tax-exempt bonds issued by
local housing agencies and sold to individual investors, says
S&amp;P's Francis Parisi.

   Warner-Lambert Co. said it signed a three-year contract
with the state of California to provide four additional
prescription drugs at discounts to Medi-Cal patients.
   Warner-Lambert's action follows similar moves by Merck &amp;
Co. and other drug makers in response to state and federal
pressure to cut health-care costs.

<TEXT>
   Pharmaceutical companies previously had been offering
discounts on brand-name drugs only to big-volume purchasers,
such as hospitals. But budget deficits and rising
prescription-drug prices have led legislators to look for
ways to control costs of state and federal health-care
programs. That has put pressure on drug manufacturers to cut
prices, in order to keep their drugs on the state and
federally approved lists.
   Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said the
agreement with California covers four drugs made by its
Parke-Davis unit. They are lipid-regulating Lopid, oral
contraceptives Loestrin and Norlestrin and anti-anginal
Nitrostat. The company declined to disclose terms of the
agreement.

   U.S. Clears Use
   Of Oil Reserves

   In `Test' Is Authorized
   As Signal to Speculators

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush authorized the sale of five
million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
to damp surging oil prices, administration officials said.
   Mr. Bush labeled the draw-down, the first use of the
reserve in a time of crisis, as a "test." A recently enacted
law gave the president the right to conduct a
five-million-barrel test without declaring that a disruption
in supply is imminent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We want to make it clear to those speculators that we
have oil available to put on the market," said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Officials said the administration also intends to consult
with Japan and Germany, starting at a meeting of the
International Energy Agency in Paris tomorrow, about a
possible long-term, coordinated use of strategic reserves.
Last week, the Energy Department, at a meeting of the
administration's top national-security aides, gave the
president a plan to sell 500,000 barrels of oil daily from
the reserve, which would be put on the world market in
combination with a total of another 500,000 barrels daily
drawn from the German and Japanese reserves.
   It isn't clear whether Japan and Germany will agree to
such a plan. They have been more reluctant than U.S.
officials to dip into strategic reserves.
   Until the past few days, Mr. Bush opposed tapping the
reserve during the crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
arguing that there isn't a genuine shortage of oil. But
officials said his view changed as prices shot skyward in
recent days.
   Mr. Bush's view evolved "as prices keep going up without
any physical change in the physical characteristics of the
market," said a senior administration official. "It seems to
be caught up in a certain speculative fever."
   Any steps to keep oil prices down would ease the
administration's worries about U.S. economic conditions and
also might serve to bolster public support for a prolonged
confrontation with Iraq by minimizing disruptions in daily
life.
   The five million barrels to be drawn from the reserve and
sold on the open market probably won't have an enormous
impact on oil markets. That amount represents only slightly
more than the approximately four million barrels of oil
Kuwait and Iraq exported each day before the crisis. But
administration aides hope the draw-down will send a signal to
oil traders that the U.S. won't let prices rise out of
control.
   If the U.S., Japan and Germany jointly decide to put a
million extra barrels of oil on the market daily, that amount
would ease the tighter supply situation created by the Iraq
crisis.
   By authorizing extraction of oil now, Mr. Bush is
approving the first use of the reserve in an international
crisis. Some oil was extracted and sold in a 1985 test.
   Many members of Congress have urged using the reserve and
have complained about price "gouging" by oil companies during
the tensions with Iraq. Thus, it seems unlikely Congress will
object to use of the reserve.
   The 590-million-barrel reserve was established after the
1973 Arab oil embargo to give the U.S. a cushion to use in a
time of an international crisis that produces a shortage. The
administration has been locked in a debate over whether to
use it in the current situation. Oil supplies at the moment
seem adequate, but prices are rising because of speculation
on oil markets about a potential future shortage if war
erupts in the Middle East.
   Oil prices have doubled since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait. Crude oil closed yesterday at $38.67 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The Energy, Transportation, State and Defense departments
have favored using the reserve to cool market speculation.
But the Treasury and Commerce departments have been opposed
-- as was Mr. Bush.
   "I think that when you have a real shortage of a product
or you see an external event that is going to guarantee that
there {will} be a shortage, then would be the time when you
most certainly should use the {reserve}," Mr. Bush told
reporters at the White House 10 days ago. "It is my judgment
that there isn't such a shortage at this time."
   Indeed, it still isn't clear that there is a shortage.
Just yesterday, Kuwait's minister of oil and finance, Sheik
Ali Khalifa alSabah, asserted that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other nations already have
made up for the shortfall caused by the ban on purchases of
oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   "It has all been replaced, 3.5 million barrels a day,"
said the minister, whose government was ousted by the Iraqi
invasion. He added: "What's driving up the market isn't
physical shortage, it's psychology."
   Others question whether the shortage has been eliminated,
and administration officials have come increasingly to
believe that the recent surge in prices has been caused
mostly by market speculators rather than the current supply
situation.
   On other matters, Sheik Ali Khalifa said Iraq has done
"extensive damage" to Kuwait's infrastructure and has killed
many Kuwaitis, although he declined to give numbers. The
Iraqis took about $300 million to $350 million in gold from
Kuwait's central bank, he said.
   The minister also said that the roughly $5 billion his
government-in-exile will give to the campaign against Iraq
will be divided about equally between military and
nonmilitary aid. He also said Kuwait and Saudi Arabia won't
aid Jordan until it changes its policy of maintaining ties to
Iraq. "Turkey and Egypt definitely, but Jordan will have to
change its policy as far as I am concerned," he said.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is offering midsized
companies access to private international voice and data
communications networks previously available only to the
largest firms.
   Separately, the US Sprint Communications Co. unit of
United Telecommunications Inc., Westwood, Kan., plans to
market a service by which customers can link local area
networks at many locations for data transmission through a
single access facility.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Currently, a company must use a number of leased private
lines and a number of access facilities to gain the same
capability for LANs, which are groups of PCs that can share
files and communicate with each other.
   Both telecommunications companies made the announcements
at the Tele-Communications Association trade show in San
Diego.
   AT&amp;T, New York, and five foreign telecommunications
companies are linking their capabilities to provide the
expanded private-network service, a spokesman said.
   A private network allows a company to design its own
dialing plan. On such a network, phone calls and data
transmissions connect faster because they bypass the local
phone-company switches that they normally follow.
   Currently, only the biggest companies can afford totally
private networks, in which AT&amp;T provides the companies with
private lines for unlimited transmissions at all times.
   A spokesman explained that AT&amp;T now is tailoring plans for
smaller companies to use such private lines only when they
need them, so-called virtual private networks. Pricing on
these private lines is lower than simply placing a
long-distance call through AT&amp;T's regular lines, the
spokesman said.

   $7.5 Billion Arms Sale to Saudi Arabia

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is expected to ask Congress
to approve an immediate $7.5 billion arms sale to Saudi
Arabia, administration officials said.
   The sale, expected to include modern tanks, armored
personnel carriers and anti-tank missiles, would be the first
portion of a package of over $20 billion publicly debated
here in recent days.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Originally, the administration hoped to submit the entire
package -- including items with a longer delivery time, such
as jet fighters. But supporters of Israel complained that the
huge sale might endanger that nation, so the administration
has decided to seek urgent items now and defer the rest until
early next year.
   Meanwhile, Turkey's President Turgut Ozal said his nation
would support "armed intervention" against Iraq if it becomes
necessary, provided the action is approved by the United
Nations.
   At a breakfast here with reporters, Mr. Ozal was asked
whether Turkey would remain neutral in any war by the U.S.
and its allies against Iraq. He said military force should be
considered only if the economic embargo fails. But he added:
"If the United Nations decides on the armed intervention, we
will not be against it." He contrasted that stand with
Turkey's neutrality in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Mr. Ozal's comment was the second in two days by a major
power hinting that a U.N.-sanctioned military strike against
Iraq would be supported if the embargo fails. On Tuesday,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze warned Baghdad
that the U.N. has the power to "suppress acts of aggression"
through force.
   Separately, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said the
Persian Gulf crisis may be entering a period of "danger" in
which Saddam Hussein "may seek to use his military force to
try to break the stranglehold that the embargo has imposed."
   He said the administration is determined "to see to it
that we send enough forces over there so that we don't leave
them exposed and at the end of a long supply line and
increase the risk to any higher level than is warranted." He
asserted, "The president believes in what I describe as the
`don't screw around' school of military strategy."
   And Secretary of State James Baker disclosed that Iraq has
demanded from the U.S. and other nations a list of
nondiplomats being sheltered in their embassies in Baghdad.
Mr. Baker said Iraq has threatened to execute Americans and
others who hide such people, adding: "We've received a note
to that effect. It falls under the heading of the principle
of the three R's, I think -- we've read it, it's repugnant
and we reject it."
   The latest phase of the economic embargo against Iraq,
which covers air traffic, got off to a confused start. Jordan
continued to receive Iraqi passenger flights. The State
Department said flights involving only passengers might not
be covered by the embargo but should be barred by an earlier
U.N. ban on financial transactions with Iraq. Jordan said it
was reviewing the passenger flights, and U.S. officials said
the U.N. might have to clarify the passenger-flight issue.
Mr. Cheney said the U.S. military hasn't been asked to
enforce the air embargo and he doesn't expect that it will do
so.
   Also, Kuwait's minister of oil and finance, Sheik Ali
Khalifa al-Sabah, said he believes little more can be done to
pressure Iraq short of using military force. "It's time
either for Iraq to bend to the will of the world or be faced
with the military option," he said.
   But Mr. Ozal stressed that the use of force isn't imminent
and that the world should wait at least three or four months
to see if the embargo can force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
He said the U.S. hadn't asked Turkey to join in a military
strike and added: "I don't want to speculate more about it."
   A Turkish role in any military action would be crucial as
Turkey borders Iraq and has a powerful army trained by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Ozal said "Turkey is
on the side of the Western world in this problem."
   The U.S. Export-Import Bank is expected today to clear a
$1.37 billion loan guarantee to help Turkey purchase 200
military-type helicopters. The helicopters would come from
the Sikorsky Aircraft Division of United Technologies Corp.,
Hartford, Conn., or other U.S. suppliers. The loan guarantee,
which would be the largest single financial transaction in
the history of the U.S. export credit agency, was tentatively
cleared earlier, and Ex-Im Bank officials said the bank's
board now could give it final approval because the House and
Senate Banking committees haven't raised any objections
during a mandatory 25-day review period.
   Mr. Ozal, who met with President Bush Tuesday, said he
doubts Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will be overthrown in a
coup because of his control over Iraqi society. But he added
that he thought the Iraqi leader would be ousted if he is
forced to give up Kuwait. Because of that, he said,
withdrawal will be "very difficult" for Saddam Hussein.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Ozal said, Iraq can be forced to move,
and the embargo might work. He said it is worth trying
because it is unprecedented in history.
   Mr. Ozal said the Kuwaiti rulers might lack popular
support in their own nation if a referendum were held. But he
said it would be a "grave mistake" to offer any concessions
to Iraq in return for a pullout from Kuwait as that would
encourage aggression by others and turn the "new world order"
into a "jungle."
   The Turkish leader said his nation is suffering
economically from the crisis and hasn't yet received promised
compensation. But he stressed that the financial plight of
Turkey has been "exaggerated" in the press, causing a few
banks to be unwilling to roll over short-term export
financing. He said Turkey would survive the crisis
economically and shouldn't be lumped together with much
poorer states as Egypt and Jordan.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury issued licensing regulations for
the export of donated food to Iraq and Kuwait. The department
said it will grant export licenses for food shipments "to
relieve human suffering" on a case-by-case basis but only
after the U.N. has approved each donation. It said such aid
must be provided by humanitarian agencies under U.N.
auspices.
   So far, the Treasury has had only two inquiries about food
licenses, said Richard Newcomb, director of the office of
foreign assets control.

   S&amp;L Regulators Tell Neil Bush Hearing
   Certain Thrift Regulations Are Vague

<LP>
   DENVER -- Federal regulators conceded that some of the
conflict-of-interest regulations Neil Bush allegedly violated
as a director of a Denver thrift are vague and don't
explicitly forbid the business relationships he had with
borrowers.
   The comments came in testimony during a hearing on
administrative charges brought against Mr. Bush, the
president's son, by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The OTS
has charged Mr. Bush with violating regulations by not fully
disclosing to fellow board members the extent of his business
ties with two real estate developers. Those developers were
involved in at least $130 million in loans and other
transactions at Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association
and caused losses of at least $60 million to the thrift.
Silverado collapsed in December 1988 and is expected to cost
taxpayers $1 billion to clean up.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, in a development that may prove damaging to Mr.
Bush's defense, the administrative law judge overseeing the
hearings said the written record showed that the involvement
of a company run by Mr. Bush with a company run by developer
Kenneth Good wasn't disclosed when Mr. Bush sought a $900,000
line of credit for Mr. Good. In 1986, Mr. Bush set up JNB
International Inc. to participate in a consortium with Good
International Inc. to seek oil and gas business in Argentina.
Mr. Bush sought the line of credit from Silverado so that
Good International could prove its financial strength to the
Argentinian government.
   But minutes of Silverado board meetings and a memo
prepared for Silverado management indicate the board was told
only that Mr. Bush's other oil company, JNB Exploration Inc.,
had an affiliation with Good International. The involvement
of JNB International "certainly was not disclosed on any of
these forms," the law judge, Daniel Davidson, said during the
proceedings. The OTS has specifically charged Mr. Bush with
making an "insufficient" disclosure because of the
involvement of JNB International.
   Mr. Bush has said that he told Silverado officials orally
of the connection with JNB International and that the mention
of JNB Exploration in the documents made it clear he and Mr.
Good were involved in the venture. But a former regulator
hired by Mr. Bush as an expert witness admitted it may have
been important for the board to know exactly which entity was
involved in the transaction. For instance, he said, the board
might be interested to know whether Mr. Bush had different
levels of personal liability in the companies.
   Though the OTS officials said the regulations governing
conflict of interest weren't explicit, the agency has
maintained it has broad power to challenge the conduct of
directors and officers for breaches of fiduciary duty or for
unsafe and unsound practices. It wasn't clear whether the
concessions by regulators yesterday would hurt the
government's case.
   Under questioning by James Nesland, an attorney for Mr.
Bush, federal officials who regulated Silverado insisted that
Mr. Bush breached his duty to the thrift, but admitted that
regulations don't specifically list the kinds of business
relationships that constitute a conflict of interest.
   In one of the three charges against Mr. Bush, the OTS said
he shouldn't have voted on $100 million in loans and other
transactions involving real estate developer Bill Walters
because Mr. Walters had an investment in JNB Exploration, and
had given Mr. Bush's company a $1.8 million line of credit
from a bank controlled by Mr. Walters. Mr. Bush didn't
disclose these ties on conflict-of-interest forms he filled
out at Silverado.
   But Terry Sandefur, a former regulator of Silverado now
with the OTS in Topeka, Kan., admitted that the regulations
don't explicitly say a director is forbidden from voting on
loans in such a situation. Mr. Nesland needled Mr. Sandefur
about his testimony that such business connections could lead
a director to act against the interests of the thrift, even
if only "subconsciously."
   "Does a director have to discern his subconscious?" Mr.
Nesland asked.
   "No, but a director has to use reasonable standards," Mr.
Sandefur replied.
   Yesterday was the second day of the hearings at the
federal court house here. Mr. Bush again didn't attend, but
is expected to testify today, along with another former
director.

   Thursday, Sept. 27, 8:30-9:30 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "The
Flash" is a surprisingly captivating adaptation of the old
comic strip. People who normally find it impossible to sit
through "Superman," "Batman" and similarly bloodless
high-tech fantasies can nevertheless delight in The Flash
(John Wesley Shipp) and his gift of superhuman speed. There
is a nicely earthbound complexity about Flash, no
lantern-jawed blob hurtling untouchably through the skies. In
fact, Flash's extraordinary powers result in some interesting
physical difficulties. Just because a person is endowed with
the power to fly faster than the speed of light doesn't mean
you can't identify with his blood sugar problems. Thanks to
his powers Flash has an appetite disorder -- a compulsion to
gorge himself. They have been fiendishly clever, these
writers, to have thrown a compulsive eater theme into this
pot: to have associated heroism and triumph over evil with
food craving, and then larded it, so to speak, with scenes of
Flash devouring pizzas and doughnuts. Who knows why "The
Flash" works? We are dealing with magic powers here.

   Saturday, Sept. 29, 10-10:30 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "Carol &amp;
Company" -- a comic sketch laced with fine adult darkness. No
comedienne around has Ms. Burnett's dramatic skills and the
series exploits those skills admirably -- so far. The first
episode (on the old and their children) mixed real spleen
with warmth. Ms. Burnett's comedy is knowing and fierce and
civilized, not the sort of thing you see on television every
day.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Sept. 30, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and
times vary so check local listings.): "The Heat of the Day,"
an adaptation of the Anglo-Irish writer Elizabeth Bowen's
novel of wartime London that isn't the least bit evocative of
wartime London. Like so much of Ms. Bowen's fiction, the life
lived here is life lived in the head, in which the landscape
and passion are all psychological.
   This works very well for the novel, not well for the
screen, and especially not the way it has been adapted. Just
what the world needed, Elizabeth Bowen translated by Harold
Pinter. Still, it is worth seeing for Patricia Hodge, who
manages, role after role, to extract the greatest power and
attractiveness from the suffering of misprized love. There is
the wonderfully menacing Michael Gambon as the fattish middle
aged counterspy. Also Michael York and Dame Peggy Ashcroft,
who, as ever, sits about looking aggrieved by the burden of
living.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Sept. 30, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "The Face of
Fear" -- based on a work by Dean R. Koontz, a best-selling
horror novelist for reasons that will not be easily apparent
to anyone watching this stew of artless violence. All this
has to do with a psychic struggling for his rightful place in
the sun -- particularly against police and other people still
rational enough to raise questions about the sanity of people
convinced that they have extraterrestrial powers. It also
concerns a string of murders, bringing us to the movie's one
redeeming feature -- the terrifyingly effective portrayal of
a couple of psychotic killers. The character played by
William Sadler is especially chilling, and always a welcome
relief from the maunderings of the psychic.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Oct. 1, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "The Keepers of
Eden" -- about zoos that, this film informs us, are the new
refuges for wildlife on the verge of extinction. We learn
that because tamarind monkeys are notoriously infertile, wise
heads were put together to boost their fecundity. Thus was
born the romance of Nikos and monkey 1772, who will enrich
the world with their offspring. This interesting film is yet
another installment in the saga of naturalist Gerald
Durrell's zoo on the Isle of Jersey.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Oct. 1, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "A Promise To Keep"
-- a strongly affecting story (based on fact) with an
unusually sensible script about a financially hard-pressed
couple who take in four orphaned children of relatives. This
outline alone should make reasonable people turn away. Still,
without treacle or sentimentality -- of the wrong kind -- the
authors put together a credible and moving work, in which
they were abetted by the excellent work of William Russ as
the beleaguered father, and Dana Delany, the winsome nurse
from "China Beach."
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Oct. 10, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E: "Our Century --
The Normandy Invasion." A reminder that this fine series,
which was pre-empted for a few weeks, has resumed. The
Normandy invasion film obviously makes use of captured
footage and offers behind-the-lines scenes few Americans have
ever seen. It includes a recorded speech by Gen. Erwin Rommel
as he assures his men, standing ready at the wrong Channel
beach, that all is in readiness for the Allied landings.

   The remaining 23.09% of KM is held by private investors.
KM shares are listed on the Frankfurt bourse and closed
Wednesday at 211 marks. In the year ended June 30, KM earned
eight marks a share on sales of 2.6 billion marks.
   An SMI spokesman said KM would remain a separate entity
and operate next to SMI's Europa Metalli-LMI S.p.A.
nonferrous metals unit. SMI doesn't plan to buy out KM's
minority shareholders, he said. "It will remain a listed
company."
   The sale is to be completed Nov. 2.

   Crude Rallies on Strong Heating Oil Market,
   Expectations of Supply Disruptions in Mideast

   Crude oil futures rallied on a strong heating oil market
and on rising expectations of supply disruptions from a
Middle East war.
   After falling more than $1 a barrel early yesterday in
U.S. futures trading, crude oil for November delivery
rebounded in the afternoon to break briefly through the $39 a
barrel mark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The November crude contract failed by 15 cents to reach
the previous futures high of $39.20 a barrel that had been
posted during trading only Monday. But it was up $1.14 for
the day to settle at $38.67 a barrel -- the highest ever for
the closing price of a so-called prompt-month crude on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   In London trading, Brent crude for November delivery also
staged an afternoon rally to a record futures high of $38.20
a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. The
November Brent then pulled back some to settle at $37.95, up
85 cents for the day.
   Oil analysts credited war talk, unfounded rumors and
speculation concerning the Middle East crisis for the crude
oil rebounds on both futures exchanges. Among the factors
cited were the extension of the United Nations embargo
against Iraq to shipments by air, Iraqi statements that this
move was an "act of war" and comments by U.S. government
officials of the increasing likelihood Saddam Hussein would
use military force to retaliate against the sanctions.
   There were also rumors -- all denied -- that an Iraqi
plane had been shot down in the Persian Gulf and that
President Bush had issued Iraq a new ultimatum to abandon
Kuwait.
   Crude oil is affected more than fuels, but all prices are
being pushed higher than supply-demand fundamentals justify
by the growing concern about a possible war in the Middle
East, oil analysts said.
   "The war premium is around $15 a barrel," said George F.
Friesen, a New York-based vice president and energy analyst
with the Deutsche Bank Group. "Once this crisis is resolved,
oil prices will come down to the low twenties again," he
said.
   Downward pressures could start as soon as today, prompted
by President Bush's authorization of the sale of oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. While there are no actual
shortages of crude to justify drawing on government
stockpiles, the theory is that economic damage could be
reduced if oil prices are brought down from the artificially
high levels.
   Fuels prices were mixed yesterday. Heating oil remained
strong on the New York Mercantile Exchange with the October
contract rising 1.37 cents to nearly $1.03 a gallon. But
gasoline was further weakened, as expected, by the latest
industry report of higher U.S. gasoline inventories, which
suggests a slackening in demand. The futures price of
unleaded gasoline for October delivery fell 1.95 cents,
although it managed to settle a notch above $1 a gallon.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices were strong but
platinum and silver weakened. December delivery gold was up
$5.20 an ounce at $412.80. October platinum dropped $3.80 an
ounce to end at $448.00, after trading as low as $440.00.
This is the first time that the October price has broken
below the critical $445.00 support level, which had held
since the beginning of 1988. December silver was off 4.2
cents an ounce at $4.8730. Gold continued to reflect Middle
Eastern tensions, according to William O'Neill, senior
futures strategist for Merrill Lynch. Also, he said, there
were rumors of a coup in the Soviet Union, which added to the
political unrest that has been the principal price-supporting
factor in gold. Meanwhile, platinum was weighed down by
slowing industrial demand as well as a lack of investor
demand for bullion, Mr. O'Neill said. "Platinum is being
affected most directly by the slumping automobile industry,
but a world-wide economic slowdown that has hit base metals
is also having its effect on platinum," he said. There is
little demand from Japan, where platinum is the favorite
precious metal, and platinum output has increased in South
Africa, the leading producer, he said. "While this platinum
isn't sold into futures directly, it is sold to dealers who
eventually hedge it in futures, and the effect of the sales
is felt," Mr. O'Neill said. The biggest disappointment among
traders, though, is that the platinum market has failed to
respond to the increasing violence in South Africa in recent
weeks, Mr. O'Neill said. While silver has lagged, too, it
hasn't been as weak as platinum, he said. "If gold posts a
strong gain and it succeeds in thrusting above, say, the key
$425 level, it could touch off a sharp rally in silver," he
said.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Wheat futures prices are likely to
get some support this morning from export agreements
announced after the close of trading yesterday. The U.S. will
sell 1.2 million metric tons of wheat to Morocco under the
government's export bonus plan, and an additional 500,000
metric tons to west African countries, futures analysts said.
In relatively light trading yesterday, wheat and corn futures
prices were supported by continued rumors that an agreement
is in the works to sell flour or grain to the Soviet Union. A
meeting of Soviet grain trading officials in Washington with
U.S. officials is sparking the as-yet unfounded rumors,
traders said. Wheat futures for December delivery gained 1.75
cents a bushel to close at $2.7650. December corn futures
added 0.5 cent a bushel to close at $2.2825. Soybean futures
prices declined in response to warm weather across much of
the Midwest and prospects for an excellent harvest. November
soybeans slid two cents a bushel to close at $6.1550.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: A very strong price for the September contract,
which expired yesterday, highlighted futures trading; other
deliveries showed only slight price changes. The September
contract ended with a gain of 4.60 cents a pound at $1.3380,
after trading as high as $1.35. Active demand for contracts
developed because of the large number of outstanding
September contacts that remained to be nullified by opposite
trades or delivery of the commodity compared with limited
deliverable supplies, according to analysts. "First there was
the weight of liquidation in London last week, and then the
focus switched to the tight deliverable supplies for
September contracts and the high open interest," one analyst
said. "With the September expiration out of the way, traders
now will concentrate more on fundamental supply-demand
considerations," he said. The world-wide economic slowdown
that could result in reduced copper consumption is a major
factor, he said.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices eased. The December contract was off
$14 a metric ton to $1,274. Gill &amp; Duffus, a major London
cocoa trading company, made its first estimate of the world
cocoa crop for the 1990-91 season, which will begin Oct. 1.
The company projected output at 2.4 million tons, about
unchanged from the current season. Consumption, it said, will
amount to almost 2.3 million tons, up from 2.2 million tons
this season. As a result, the surplus next season will narrow
to about 130,000 tons from 187,000 tons this season. This
will be the seventh consecutive surplus, Gill &amp; Duffus said.
Although a smaller surplus is predicted, "it is hard to get
excited about that, considering that global stocks of cocoa
amount to 1.5 million tons, the equivalent of about eight
months usage, even though we are heading into the peak
consumption season," said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill
Lynch.

   WASHINGTON -- Seeking to reassert itself in the
congressional debate on clean-air legislation, the White
House offered House-Senate conferees a compromise.
   In a letter sent yesterday to the leaders of the
House-Senate conference committee, Rep. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.) and Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), President Bush said,
"I fear that the slow progress and apparent course of the
conference committee may jeopardize enactment of this
critically important legislation."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far, the administration has had little influence in the
deliberations, which have produced just one major accord so
far: an agreement on curbing industrial sources of smog that
the administration considers too stringent. The president's
proposal, which accompanied the letter and contained elements
from both bills, marked both an effort to spur the slow talks
and avoid blame if the negotiations fail to produce a bill in
the remaining weeks of the congressional session.
   "It was the president's initial bill and his agreement
with Senate that got the ball 90 yards down the field," said
the presidential domestic-policy assistant, Roger Porter,
using a football metaphor that three other administration
officials also employed yesterday. "Now we're trying to
figure how to get the ball the last 10 yards."
   Responding to the letter, Rep. Dingell and Sen. Baucus
each emphasized his intention to pass a strong bill this
year. Rep. Dingell added that "I'm sorry they didn't get the
letter to us when the House and Senate passed versions of the
Clean-Air Act four months ago before Memorial Day."
   Mr. Porter said the administration's compromise would cost
industry between $22 billion and $23 billion in the year
2005, when its provisions would be fully in effect. That's
less than the $25.4 billion price tag for the Senate and
House bills, according to the latest White House estimate.
   Among other points, the White House proposal calls for
adopting the Senate's acid-rain provisions. Although both
bills would reduce annual sulfur-dioxide emissions by 10
billion tons from 1980 levels, administration officials
contend that the Senate provisions would be more workable.
   The administration also prefers a controversial Senate
approach for reducing the cancer risk that remains for nearby
residents after factories have applied the best available
technology to curb harmful emissions. On reformulated
gasoline, which would be required to be sold in the smoggiest
cities, the compromise takes provisions from both bills, with
modifications designed to reduce costs and increase
flexibility for industry.
   The White House also is urging the conferees to adopt
Senate language on industrial smog rather than the already
accepted House provisions. It also reiterated its opposition
to a provision designed to provide financial assistance to
workers who lose their jobs as a result of this legislation.
Officials have said adoption of this provision could prompt a
veto.

   NEW YORK -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board took
steps toward replacing a controversial rule on accounting for
income taxes.
   The proposal would allow companies to book a deferred or
future tax credit on current income statements by
anticipating future income. Because a company must have
earnings to realize a tax benefit in future years, it must
expect that it will be profitable enough to recognize the tax
benefit on its financial statement in the current year.
Therefore, the new rule would largely apply to profitable
companies; loss-producing companies would continue to use
tax-loss carry-forwards.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the existing rule, such current recognition of a
future tax benefit can't be recognized, because income
anticipation isn't permitted. "Now they are saying you can
anticipate future incomeincome that is expected or more
likely than not to occur in future years, which would allow
you to recognize" a later tax benefit currently, said Ray
Simpson, manager of the tax project for the FASB.
   The board, based in Norwalk, Conn., directed its staff to
develop an "exposure draft," or a new proposal that could
eventually lead to a new rule. The staff could issue a new
proposal in two months. But it isn't clear how soon after
that a new rule might be issued, because a public-comment
period is required, after which the board will reconsider the
proposal.
   Although he said the existing rule doesn't officially take
effect until fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 1991, Mr.
Simpson said some companies are already following it.

   Shares of MCA Inc. surged $7.25 a share to close at $61.25
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, based on a
series of rumors suggesting that MCA's talks to be acquired
by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. were progressing
rapidly.
   However, MCA issued a statement after the close of trading
that merely repeated its confirmation on Tuesday that it is
talking about a friendly buy-out with a "major international
company" which it didn't identify. MCA, based in Universal
City, Calif., said it issued the statement after the Big
Board asked if there were any corporate developments that
would explain the jump in MCA shares.

   People familiar with the discussions have said that
Tokyo-based Matsushita could pay between $80 and $90 a share
for MCA, or a total of $7.4 billion to $8.3 billion.
   Several takeover stock traders attributed the surge in MCA
shares just before the close to a panic among professional
traders who want to own big positions in MCA if a deal is
announced soon. "People are trying to make a whole year's
profit on this one deal. They're afraid that the train is
leaving the station," said one takeover-stock trader.

   McDonnell Douglas
   Accused by Dingell
   Of Poor Managing

   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Sloppy management has pushed the
price tag of McDonnell Douglas's C-17 military cargo plane to
more than $400 million each, the chairman of a House
subcommittee on oversight and investigations charged
yesterday.
   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), who leads the Energy and
Commerce Committee panel, said in a letter to Rep. Les Aspin
that cost overruns at the company's sprawling factory here
show there is a "need for action to protect the taxpayers'
interest," and he called on the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee to conduct a joint hearing into the
matter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While blasting the nation's No. 1 defense contractor for a
"management collapse," Rep. Dingell said the Air Force has
advised his staff that "the only mechanism left to get
{McDonnell} Douglas's attention was either to suspend or
significantly reduce progress payments on the C-17 program."
   A spokesman at McDonnell Douglas's St. Louis headquarters
acknowledged that the Air Force has halted all progress
payments on the C-17 since July, pending the completion of a
cost-performance review. But he disputed the $400
million-a-copy number, saying that it represented only the
first planes off the line; the real "flyaway" cost of a
single C-17, he contended, is about $120 million, based on
the 120 aircraft the Pentagon says it wants to buy.
   In his correspondence, Rep. Dingell cited internal
McDonnell Douglas reports from April, which showed that the
company's estimate to complete full-scale engineering and
development work on the C-17 had climbed more than $836
million above its earlier projection. He added that "more
disturbing, the situation appeared to have been
deteriorating" as time went on.
   The lawmaker, chiding the company for "an absolutely
appalling picture in factory labor performance," also singled
out a report that showed McDonnell Douglas "was spending 25.8
assembly hours to produce work its own industrial engineers
determined should take one hour." In May 1989, he noted, the
ratio of actual hours on the project to so-called "should
take" hours was 5.15; a year later, the figure doubled. "Some
learning curve]" said Mr. Dingell.
   But a spokesman for the company here downplayed the
Dingell letter, noting that an $836 million cost overrun
would still leave McDonnell Douglas some $300 million below
the contract ceiling of $4.9 billion. After that crucial
benchmark is reached, financially strapped McDonnell Douglas
would have to absorb all expenses on its own, without any
government reimbursement.
   Most importantly, the spokesman indicated that the company
is still below the ceiling level, and expects to remain there
until it completes the pact. The company, he reiterated, has
met every milestone on the C-17 program since November 1989.

continued covert aid to anti-government forces in Afghanistan
but withheld half of the estimated $300 million sought by the
Central Intelligence Agency until a vote next spring.
   The action follows an appeal by CIA Director William
Webster at a closed-door meeting Tuesday after the
subcommittee's bipartisan leadership recommended that no new
money be approved for the prolonged war.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The outcome is a victory for supporters of the guerrillas,
but the restrictions reflect new skepticism in the panel,
which has been one of the strongest advocates of aid in the
past.
   The subcommittee's decision came as part of deliberations
on an underlying defense and intelligence appropriations bill
for the fiscal year beginning Monday. Among major weapons
systems, the measure would provide an estimated $350 million
in advanced procurement funding for the Navy's 18th Trident
submarine, made by General Dynamics Corp.'s Electric Boat
division. Still, the funding represents a deep cut from the
$1.2 billion authorized by the House.

   Bush Plan for Deposit Insurance Shifts
   Risk From Taxpayer to Banks, Depositors

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, giving the first
glimpse into its long-awaited plan to revamp deposit
insurance and the banking and thrift industries, said it
favors substantially shifting risk from the taxpayer to the
banks and depositors.
   Banks and thrifts would pay insurance premiums based on
the amount of their lending risk, would transfer riskier
activities to uninsured affiliates, and would tighten
underwriting standards for real estate loans. Depositors
would be limited to a particular number of insured accounts,
and pension funds and other big depositors would face limited
insurance coverage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Robert Glauber, undersecretary of the Treasury,
characterized his testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee as a "progress report" on the Bush administration's
deposit-insurance study. Nonetheless, "there are a number of
specific areas where we have begun to lean towards specific
conclusions," he said.
   The complex issue has been pushed to the front burner in
Congress by outrage over the savings-and-loan bailout, and
anxiety over the strained bank insurance fund. There is an
increasing appetite on Capitol Hill to tackle deposit
insurance and bank activities in one big legislative package
early next year.
   "We have to put this on the fast track, and clear the
track," said Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D.,
Mich.). He said Congress is awaiting a signal from President
Bush that the issue will be a priority next year. "If he is
willing to engage, we can really move this along," Sen.
Riegle said.
   The plan didn't specifically address some problematic
questions, such as whether to abandon the "too big to fail"
doctrine. Under that practice, banking regulators have
insured all deposits at large, failed banks, even accounts
that exceed the $100,000 deposit-insurance limit.
   Even that policy appears headed for revision. Both Sen.
Riegle and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of the
House Banking Committee, have opposed protecting all
depositors at large banks. Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman
William Seidman have both expressed uneasiness with it.
   "That's very important for shaping the rest of the
deposit-insurance reform proposals," said Robert Dugger,
economist for the American Bankers Association. For one,
changing that policy would help make small banks more
competitive with large banks, which alone benefit from the
too big to fail policy.
   The administration is keeping mum on how it would carry
out its other ideas. Those matters, such as which bank powers
would be restricted to affiliates, and how to keep track of
the number of insured accounts, are relegated to the
full-blown study on deposit insurance.
   But altering those practices would change the industry
radically. Investment managers are already bracing themselves
for a narrowing of coverage for big pension funds, which are
currently protected up to $100,000 for each beneficiary.
Those deposits are likely to flee to insurance companies,
which sell competing instruments. "We anticipate some sort of
curtailment on exisiting coverage," said Steve Finegan of
Morley Capital Management, an investment manager.
   Shifting riskier loans to affiliates and subsidiaries
would probably cause an industry contraction -- at least in
the banking sector operating with deposit insurance. The
administration thinks that would be fine. "The problem is
that the amount of funds attracted into the banking system
may be far greater than the amount that can be deployed
wisely in traditional banking assets," Mr. Glauber said.
   Also, interest rates on loans generated at the banking
affiliates are likely to rise above current rates, because
they will be funded from higher-cost sources than bank
deposits.
   Overall, lawmakers and industry lobbyists were somewhat
surprised at how easily a general consensus appears to be
forming. "I'm really pleased to see things are further
advanced than I thought they would be even a month ago," said
Lee Peckarsky, a lobbyist for the National Council of Savings
Institutions. "To the extent that Congress focuses on this in
September, it sets the agenda for an early January start."
   Meanwhile, however, both Congress and the administration
refuse to propose specific funding for the savings-and-loan
cleanup, which will run out of cash by the end of the year.
The agency needs at least $20 billion to get through next
April, or else insolvent thrifts will remain open and
accumulate losses. The Treasury has drafted legislation for
three different funding proposals, but Congress is waiting
for the Treasury to endorse one.
   Mr. Glauber said any choice is fine. "There is no
ambiguity," said Mr. Glauber. "We need money before Congress
goes out."
   He also urged Congress to quickly pass legislation
removing the ceiling on deposit-insurance premiums and giving
regulators greater flexibility with the insurance fund. The
House has already passed a version of this legislation.

   J2 Communications, an entertainment concern, said it
modified slightly its $4.7 million offer to acquire National
Lampoon Inc.
   Under terms of the original and the revised offers,
shareholders of the New York-based humor magazine would
receive two-thirds of a share of J2 common stock plus a
warrant for each share of Lampoon currently held. The revised
offer lowered the exercise price of the warrant to $3.25 a
share from $3.75 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The modification reflects a minor change in the relative
value of the two companies' stocks since the agreement was
reached in March, J2 said. National Lampoon's shares have
fallen to $1.75 bid from $3.125 bid in over-the-counter
trading. J2's shares have dropped to $1.875 bid from $3 bid.
   Shareholders of both companies will vote on the
transaction at meetings set for Oct. 24 in Los Angeles.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The Semiconductor Industry Association
said that it expects world semiconductor sales to grow 1.5%
to $49.5 billion by the end of 1990. The trade group also
projected that sales will jump by 12.5% in 1991 and 19.5 % in
1992. But some analysts found these predictions excessively
upbeat, in light of falling chip prices.
   Erik Jansen, semiconductor analyst for Robertson Stephens
&amp; Co., said a 1.5% sales growth for 1990 was "on the high
end," and he characterized the 12.5% forecast for 1991 as
"optimistic and not believable at this point. . . . It just
sounds too good."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Jansen pointed out that for the industry to rack up
12.5% growth, memory prices would have to stay the same when,
in fact, they've been falling. For example, one megabit
dynamic random access memories, among the most broadly sold
chips, has dropped in price by half since March 1990. In
addition, Mr. Jansen said, personal-computer sales growth
would have to be at least 10% in 1991, but most PC analysts
are predicting single-digit growth for next year.
   The trade group predicted sales growth in the U.S. and
Japanese markets for 1991 of, respectively, 9.3% and 13.6%.
For 1990, however, the SIA projected a 2.3% decrease in U.S.
sales to $14.5 billion, compared with $14.8 billion in 1989.
Chip sales to Japan should drop 2.8% in 1990, the trade group
said, to $18.6 billion, compared with $19.1 billion in 1989.

   NEW YORK -- The badly battered corporate junk bond market
took another pounding yesterday.
   Falling stock prices and further signs of economic
weakness unnerved investors, helping to drive down junk-bond
prices for the fifth consecutive day. Prices of many junk
issues, those high-risk, high-yielding bonds with low credit
ratings or no ratings at all, fell by more than 3/4 of a
point, or over $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount, in moderate
trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Junk bonds of some casino companies were hit even harder.
Junk-bond prices now have dropped in 11 of the past 12
trading days, said Gregory Curran, research analyst at
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Fears about the financial system's health once again
depressed prices of several large banks' stocks and bonds
yesterday. Prices of bonds issued by Chase Manhattan Corp.,
Citicorp and several other large banks have fallen sharply
recently in the aftermath of Chase's decision to cut its
dividend and reduce its employees by 5,000.
   Worried investors increasingly are turning for safety to
short-term issues, especially Treasury bills, driving up
prices and pushing rates down. For example, the
bond-equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills fell
yesterday to 7.53% from 7.59% Tuesday.
   "Earlier this week, the main theme was fear about higher
oil prices, but today the main theme was fear of financial
fragility," said James Capra, executive vice president at
Lehman Government Securities Inc.
   Many investors yesterday also bought new four-year
Treasury notes, auctioned at an average annual yield of
8.53%. "There was significant demand" from investors for the
new notes, said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president at S.G.
Warburg &amp; Co. "For the small investor, a yield above 8 1/2%
for four years on a Treasury note is probably a fairly decent
investment. That's a fairly attractive return on a riskless
asset."
   Long-term Treasury bonds held steady, finishing at about
the same levels as late Tuesday. For example, the Treasury's
latest 30-year bonds were quoted late in the day at a yield
of about 9 1/8%, unchanged from Tuesday. Traders said fears
about higher oil prices were offset partly by speculation
that U.S. government officials may be close to a budget
deficit reduction agreement.
   A budget accord probably would allow the Federal Reserve
to cut short-term interest rates, many traders and investment
advisers agree. "I would be very surprised if the Fed doesn't
lower interest rates within the next few weeks," said
Geoffrey Bell, president of Geoffrey Bell &amp; Co., a financial
consulting firm here.
   Mr. Bell also expects further interestrate cuts later this
year. He predicted yesterday the rate on federal funds, or
overnight loans between banks, will fall to 7% by year end
from its recent level of 8%.
   But even if the Fed does cut short-term rates, don't
expect long-term bond yields to follow suit, Mr. Bell says.
"The long bond will dance to a different tune" than
short-term rates, he said. By year end, he said, long-term
Treasury bonds will yield between about 9% and 9 1/4%.
   In the municipal bond market, prices ended mixed. Today,
traders expect preliminary details to be announced on a huge
new $1.3 billion bond issue by the state of Massachusetts.
Some traders yesterday predicted the issue will include bonds
due in about seven years and yielding around 8%. Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets heads the group of underwriters.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate &amp; Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Corporate &amp; Junk Bonds Junk bond prices slumped again
yesterday.
   "I think dealers are scared," said David Briggs, senior
trader at Federated Investors Corp. "They are not committing
any capital to the market at this point.
   Many junk bonds finished with declines of between 3/4
point and one point. Junk bonds from casino companies were
especially hard hit on fears that those companies' revenues
would be hurt by a recession.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding Corp.'s 14% first mortgage bonds,
due in 1998, fell two points to 35, while Caesars World
Inc.'s 13.50% subordinated notes, due in 1997, dropped one
point to 94.
   Also hard hit were junk bonds of some companies -- such as
retailers -- thought to be especially vulnerable to a
recession.
   In the investment-grade corporate bond market, issues of
several large banks were hit hard again yesterday. For
example, Citicorp's 9.75% subordinated capital notes,
maturing in 1999, tumbled 5 1/2 points to a price of 83 5/8,
bid, to yield 12.90%.
   Chase Manhattan's 10% subordinated notes, due in 1999,
fell two points to a bid price of 76 1/8. Manufacturers
Hanover Corp.'s 8.50% subordinated notes, maturing in 1999,
dropped 3 1/2 points to a bid price of 75.
   The bank sector "was like a pinball machine," said Joseph
Foley, a corporate bond trader at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. "Nobody knew what was going to happen next."
   Among the other banking sector issues that sustained
sizable losses were Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Security
Pacific Corp. bonds. Bankers Trust's 9.50% subordinated
notes, maturing in 2000, finished down 1 1/8 points at 92
1/4, while Security Pacific's 9.75% subordinated notes,
maturing in 1999, fell 1 1/4 points to 94.
   Thomas Quigley, a corporate bond trader at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said a lack of liquidity
in the bank sector accelerated the declines in some bonds.
"The day was characterized by growing fears about bank bonds,
and the lower levels got, the more sellers came in as fear
dominated," he said.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the large credit-rating agency,
said yesterday it has reduced its ratings on about $5.2
billion of Chase debt and preferred stock. Among its
downgrades, S&amp;P reduced its senior debt ratings on Chase
Manhattan Corp. to triple-B-plus from single-A-minus. It also
reduced its subordinated debt ratings on Chase Manhattan
Corp. to triple-B from triple-B-plus. But it left unchanged
its commercial paper rating at single A-2.
   Chase issued a statement yesterday saying "we disagree"
with the S&amp;P downgrades, "particularly in light of S&amp;P's own
comments citing Chase's strong base of retail banking
profits, the enhanced profits expected from our aggressive
restructuring efforts, as well as our liquidity and financial
flexibility."
   Furthermore, the Chase statement said, "Chase will have
$11 billion in total capital at Sept. 30 and capital ratios
in excess of the 1992 regulatory guidelines."
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its ratings Tuesday
on Chase's long-term debt and commercial paper.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury note and bond prices ended little changed.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was quoted late
yesterday at 96 5/32, up very slightly from 96 3/32 late
Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 98 1/2, to
yield 8.98%. Late Tuesday, they were quoted at 98 11/32, to
yield 9%.
   The new two-year notes, sold Tuesday at an average annual
yield of 8.18%, were quoted late yesterday at about 8.15%.
   Rates fell on short-term bills. The discount rate on
three-month bills fell to 7.29% from 7.36% late Tuesday.
   Here are details of the Treasury's sale of four-year notes
yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   Municipal bonds ended narrowly mixed as the rising price
of oil again took its toll.
   Earlier in trading, tax-exempt securities had reached
session highs, gaining as much as 1/4 point, as traders cited
a decline in oil prices as one impetus.But as oil reversed
its losses, prices began slipping.
   In new issue activity, a Chase Securities Inc. group
reported an unsold balance of just over $20 million on an
issue of $95 million Maryland general obligation bonds. The
issue yields from 6.10% in 1993 to 7.15% in 2005.
   Ahead on the calendar, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
group is expected to set the preliminary pricing for $1.3
billion Massachusetts dedicated income tax bonds today.
   Traders put yields at the long end of the issue at 8% for
bonds maturing in 1997.
   In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue due 2018 was unchanged at 95 3/4 to yield 7.55%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bond prices fell sharply.
   Traders cited remarks by U.K.'s Chancellor of the
Exchequer, John Major. Speaking in Washington, Mr. Major said
Britain won't join the European exchange rate mechanism until
inflation is falling, and that inflation isn't likely to fall
until next year.
   Britain's 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 dropped 22/32 point
to 99 2/32, to yield 11.87%. The 12% bonds due 1995 fell
14/32 to 99 10/32 to yield 12.17%.
   In other major markets, Japanese bond prices also fell,
and bond futures prices ended at their lowest levels since
they were instituted five years ago.
   Japan's benchmark government bonds, the No. 119, 4.8%
issue due in 1999, fell 0.14 to 80.63, on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The yield rose 8.71% from 8.675%.

   Mortgage-backed securities rose as much as 6/32.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue
for October delivery rose 1/8 point to 97 25/32, Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue rose 3/ 32 to 98 9/32, and
Federal National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% securities
rose 3/ 32 to 98 3/32.
   In the asset-backed market, Salomon Brothers Inc. priced
an $800 million Household Credit Card Trust 1990-1 offering.
The issue is backed by Visa and MasterCard receivables from

   Avery Inc. said it completed a merger agreement with its
two controlling shareholders and top officers under which
they will acquire the shares they don't already own for about
$4 million.
   The two are Nelson Peltz and Peter May, who own 83% of
Avery. Avery said the two will acquire the remaining 9.5
million shares at 43 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Avery said its directors approved the merger agreement
following the recommendation of a special committee appointed
to evaluate the proposal.
   In over-the-counter trading, Avery shares were quoted
yesterday at a bid price of 31 cents a share.
   Avery started out as a coal company in 1984. In 1986, it
bought Uniroyal Chemical Holding Co. from Uniroyal Inc. for
$710 million and financed the acquisition through $910
million of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. It then sold
Uniroyal Chemical to a management-led group last year in a
transaction valued at $800 million.
   Avery, which continues to operate a coal company, said
last November that after fees and repayment of debt the
company was left with about $24 million in cash and
securities from the Uniroyal sale.
   When the company completed the sale of Uniroyal Chemical
last year it also completed a recapitalization in which
Messrs. Peltz and May surrendered warrants and preferred
stock in exchange for a larger stake in Avery's common
shares.

   In WPPSS Case

   A federal judge said General Electric Co. hid serious
doubts about its design of a giant nuclear-containment vessel
for a Washington Public Power Supply System
electricity-generating plant, in what he called an
"unconscionable" breach of GE's "duty of good faith and fair
dealing."
   The ruling removes a limitation of damages of about $110
million under terms of the 1971 contract covering WPPSS's No.
2 plant near Richland, Wash. It conceivably could also expose
General Electric to further litigation involving some of the
dozen plants in the U.S. where similar boiling-water reactor
designs are used.

   Judge Alan A. McDonald had sealed his ruling last June to
avoid causing bias in the jury that was due to consider a
$1.2 billion WPPSS suit accusing General Electric of fraud
and breach of contract.
   When the 10-member jury split in July and a mistrial was
declared in the case, tried in Phoenix, Ariz., the judge's
ruling remained sealed on the issue of whether General
Electric's liability under the contract terms should remain
capped.
   The ruling was unsealed yesterday by Judge McDonald in
Spokane, Wash., however, at the request of The Wall Street
Journal and of Clearing Up, a Seattle-based energy industry
newsletter.
   WPPSS has requested a new trial before Judge McDonald,
without a jury, on the broader issues of General Electric's
liability in the case. A spokesman for the utility called the
judge's wording "quite damning," and said the ruling "shows
that we were correct and prudent in investing five years of
effort in the case." He particularly noted that the judge
described some testimony by GE personnel as "forced,
sometimes forlorn and sometimes incredible."
   The judge said that "key personnel within {GE} were aware
of the existence of a number of serious, unresolved
questions" about the nuclear-containment system, but added
that "testing sufficient to resolve those questions wasn't
conducted" before the contract was signed.
   The judge, at General Electric's request, also released a
"special verdict form" showing eight jurors had voted that
the company hadn't "committed either fraudulent
misrepresentation or fraudulent omission" in dealing with
WPPSS. That vote, however, wouldn't be part of any new trial,
while Judge McDonald's removal of the cap on GE's liability
would be expected to remain in force.
   The judge used harsh language in critizing General
Electric for withholding from WPPSS "any doubts or questions
about the adequacy of its pressure-suppression system" in
negotiating the contract. The system, within the thick
concrete containment-vessel enclosure, is designed to prevent
the escape of radiation following a nuclear accident.
   Responding to Judge McDonald's ruling, a spokesman for GE,
based in Fairfield, Conn., said: "GE disagrees with the
court's ruling, believing it was an issue for the jury and
not the judge. We would have challenged it if there was a
need to do so. We believe it has no binding effect."
   "The outcome of the exhaustive five-month trial
convincingly shows that {the} WPPSS charges are without
merit," the spokesman added.
   Several other utilities with nuclear reactors and
containment vessels designed by General Electric have closely
watched the WPPSS case. Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Co. and
Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. sent attorneys to observe
parts of the Arizona trial. General Electric has said that
the only similar lawsuit against it has been a $600 million
action filed by Long Island Lighting Co., owner of the
Shoreham nuclear plant in Brookhaven, N.Y. Jury selection for
the trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 5.
   The judge characterized as "a fairly sophisticated form of
Russian roulette" the comments of one witness who "pointed
with pride to the several start-ups as constituting a
full-scale test."
   Listing several internal company documents showing
problems that could crop up with the containment design,
Judge McDonald said: "General Electric knew these problems
should be examined but decided to adopt only an analytical
approach, because the full-scale tests required to prove that
the phenomena would not occur in its then present containment
design would be, I am quoting from the documents, `very
expensive.'"
   A "most telling piece of evidence," the judge said, was
one August 1968 company memorandum mentioning the need for "a
full-scale test" to answer one design question. There wasn't
any evidence presented to show the test was conducted, Judge
McDonald said, adding: "General Electric's witnesses to
explain this document were not believable."
   Other GE documents he cited, dating back to 1958, showed
that the company "was aware of certain phenomena that could
occur as a result of the normal or accidental operation" of
the system. A May 1958 preliminary test result that was cited
considered a containment-vessel phenomenon called "water
hammer," resulting from the collapse of steam bubbles. Water
hammer wasn't a problem in low-steam rates used in the test,
the document said. But it added that "it cannot be safely
concluded" that a full-scale steam discharge wouldn't "create
shock waves or forces which could be damaging," yet wouldn't
show up in the small-scale tests.
   WPPSS's claims against General Electric in the suit it
filed in 1985 aren't related to the 1983 default by the
utility on $2.25 billion of bonds issued for construction of
its nuclear units Nos. 4 and 5. Those units were abandoned
after being partially built.

   Heard on the Street:
   If It Looks Like a Bear and Walks Like a Bear,
   Chances Are That the Bear Market Has Arrived

   Attention investors: You are now entering bear territory.
   Investment pros usually define a bear market as a fall in
stock prices that lasts at least two months and drags down
prices at least 20%. We're just about there.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a peak -- actually,
twin peaks -- at 2999.75 on July 16 and July 17. Since then,
it has fallen 18% to 2459.65. A decline that pierces the 2400
level would make this a bear market by almost anyone's
definition.
   Indeed, some money managers and analysts have been saying
for weeks or months that a bear market is upon us. "The
Middle East crisis has unleashed a fearless, relentless bear
on the financial markets," Carmine Grigoli, chief strategist
for First Boston, wrote recently. "Until the crisis is
resolved, or the market moves to much lower levels, the bear
will not be put back into its cage."
   If broad measures of stock-market performance are used,
the current market qualified as a bear some time ago. For
example, the Value Line index, which includes some 1700
stocks (in contrast to 30 in the Dow industrials) peaked Oct.
9, 1989, and has dropped about 30% since then. The NASDAQ
Composite index of over-the-counter stocks peaked the same
day and is down about 27%.
   Assuming we're in bear country, what should investors
expect? Based on precedent, the decline will carry stock
prices considerably lower. In bear markets, stock prices
typically fall about 38%, and the decline usually lasts about
19 months.
   If a bear market started in July -- and it proves to be of
average ferocity -- investors can expect the Dow industrials
to drop to about 1860 by the end of next year. When would a
recovery start? If things flow normally, some time around the
beginning of 1992.
   And how will investors recognize the bottom when it comes?
One sign: Investing will become so scary that it seems like
an unnatural act. Another sign -- again, assuming that
history proves a guide -- is that stocks probably will have
sunk to prices not far from their book values, or assets
minus liabilities. And the average dividend yields on stocks
probably will be up near 6%.
   The market is a long way from such levels now. When the
Dow industrials almost reached 3000 last July, stock prices
were pretty rich, compared with book values and dividends.
Investors may have taken comfort -- false comfort, in
retrospect -- from the fact that stocks weren't as pricey as
they were before the 1987 crash. But those 1987 valuations
were some of the richest ever.
   Now that stock prices are falling, investors such as
Charles Brandes, president of Brandes Investment Management
in San Diego, look foward to hunting for bargain-priced
stocks. Mr. Brandes, whose accounts are about 50% in cash,
has begun doing a little buying, but says "the market hasn't
gone low enough yet" to really plunge in. He expects to do a
lot of buying if the Dow industrials fall to the 2000 to 2200
range. He wouldn't be surprised if stock prices fell even
further, but at those prices, he wouldn't mind being early.
   Like Mr. Brandes, a lot of investors are watching and
waiting. In fact, one feature typical of bear markets is low
trading volume. In that respect, a bear market is far
different from a crash. A crash -- a sudden, massive decline
on heavy volume -- feels like being clubbed over the head by
Arnold Schwarzenegger, but at least the damage is over with
all at once.
   A bear market is more like water torture. On
low-to-moderate volume, the market falls more often than it
rises, over a long period. Investors may not get hurt much on
any given day. But when they total the damage a year later,
it's likely to be worse than that of almost any crash.
   Of course, a new bear market could be milder or more
severe than typical. Frederic E. Russell, a money manager in
Tulsa, Okla., is relatively optimistic. "I would say we're in
a bear market until the uncertainty in Iraq is resolved," he
says. And he concedes that right now the market is
"unnerving, even to the calmest person."
   But if the Mideast crisis is solved through "some bold
action, either military action or an ingenious face-saver for
(Saddam) Hussein," then Mr. Russell thinks things could get
better in a hurry. "The economic forces are not so powerfully
entrenched that they couldn't be reversed," he says.
   More pessimistic is Charles Will, a money manager in
Louisville, Ky., who anticipates the one-two punch of a
recession and a bear market. "We're probably looking at
between 1500 and 2000" on the Dow industrials, he predicts.
   If stocks fell to 1.08 times book value, as is typical in
past bear markets, Mr. Will notes, the Dow industrials would
fall to below 1400. If stocks fell until they yielded 6.1% in
dividends -- again the typical level at bottoms -- the Dow
industrials would be selling at about 1700.
   At those levels, Mr. Will says, he would be an eager buyer
of stocks. But for the moment, he has only 15% of his
portfolio in stocks, 5% in bonds, and 80% in cash (meaning
safe, short-term investments such as Treasury bills).
   Only investor complacency has kept stock prices from
falling further, says Salomon Brothers, in a strategy letter
by Robert S. Salomon Jr. and colleagues. After all, the
market has risen in 13 of the past 15 years, and each of the
two declines was less than 5%. "Investors talk as though they
were nervous," Salomon says. "But most people are not
trading" as if they were. Salomon's prediction: "The Dow will
decline to 2100" within nine months.
   Robert Stovall, head of Stovall/Twenty-First Consistent
Return Trust, says he's worried about some things that have
nothing to do with the Mideast. "Will Gorbachev make it
through the end of the year?" he asks. "When you don't have
bread or potatoes in the capital city . . . he may not make
it."
   Mr. Stovall also worries about how much longer George
Bush's political honeymoon will last, about the shaky
condition of financial institutions, especially banks, and
about the economy. He says: "We are definitely on the cusp,
on the lip, on the fringe of a recession."
   So, Mr. Stovall concludes that we're in for both a
recession and a bear market. He notes that stocks usually
turn down a few months before a recession begins, and turn up
a few months before it ends, as investors look ahead to a
recovery. Still, he says, it could easily be "a year before
this is over with."

   BankAmerica
   Appears to Win
   Bid for MeraBank

   SAN FRANCISCO -- BankAmerica Corp., continuing to dance on
the grave of the troubled thrift industry, has apparently won
the bidding for MeraBank, once Arizona's largest savings and
loan association.
   The acquisition from the federal Resolution Trust Corp.,
BankAmerica's second of a major, insolvent Arizona S&amp;L this
year, would catapult the bank holding company into one of the
state's largest financial institutions within less than four
months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Terms of the transaction weren't known, but analysts
believe BankAmerica paid slightly more than the $81 million
it paid in May for Western Savings &amp; Loan Association, a
Phoenix-based thrift that is somewhat smaller than cross-town
rival MeraBank.
   Analysts figured in both instances that BankAmerica paid
an amount roughly equal to 3% to 4% of so-called core retail
deposits. By contrast, BankAmerica earlier this month paid a
hefty premium of 6.85% of deposits to acquire Benjamin
Franklin Savings &amp; Loan Association, based in Portland, Ore.
   Spokesmen for BankAmerica and the Resolution Trust Corp.
declined comment on the transaction. The RTC took control of
MeraBank in January and recently vowed to sell it by the end
of the third quarter. A BankAmerica official said he
understood that the company had been informed that it was the
successful bidder for the thrift. And Security Pacific Corp.,
considered BankAmerica's main rival in the sale, is
understood to have been told by regulators that its bid had
been rejected.
   "There is a strong feeling that there is a window of
opportunity" to acquire market share on the cheap through
purchasing failed thrifts, said the BankAmerica official.
"The appetite for further acquisitions is very strong."
   MeraBank has 66 branches and deposits totaling roughly
$4.7 billion. Western Savings had 61 branches and deposits of
about $3.5 billion. Only Valley National Corp. and First
Interstate Bancorp would have larger Arizona operations than
BankAmerica, state banking officials estimated.
   A subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp.
until its January seizure, MeraBank rolled up huge losses in
commercial real-estate. MeraBank's collapse, including losses
from an expansion into Texas, operations of which aren't
believed to be part of the sale to BankAmerica, is expected
to cost the government at least $1.5 billion.
   Indeed, the sale to BankAmerica, and other recent sales of
thrifts in the state to banks, marks the end of an era. "For
all practical purposes, the S&amp;L industry in Arizona has been
eliminated," said Hank Rivoir, the Arizona banking
superintendent. "I personally am happy to see it."

   Clinton of Arkansas, Ex-Boy Wonder Still Hoping
   To Be President, Is Battling to Remain Governor

   QUITMAN, Ark. -- Even boy wonders eventually turn
gray-haired and fortysomething.
   It's happened to Gov. Bill Clinton. Graying and 44, he's a
dozen years past those precocious days when he was the
nation's youngest governor and already being measured as
presidential timber. But if he's experiencing a midlife
crisis, he's confronting it with humor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'm not hung up on being a boy wonder anymore," he grins.
"I'm lunging into middle age."
   Bill Clinton also is lunging into the home stretch of a
difficult re-election campaign, one whose outcome could
rejuvenate -- or end -- his political career. He's bidding
for a fifth term and 14 years in the statehouse, which would
be an Arkansas record. Beyond that, he hasn't abandoned his
presidential hopes.
   "Shoot, no," he says between campaign stops here on the
edge of the Ozarks. "I'd like to serve another term and run."
   Another term would give Mr. Clinton, who combines a Rhodes
scholar intellect with an innately Southern gift of gab, an
opportunity to consolidate his state reforms and burnish a
faded national image. He's still living down a long-winded
1988 Democratic National Convention speech that, like some
runaway wagon, rolled right over frantic attempts by
convention officials to bring it to a close. Here at home, a
rebellious legislature has shredded key Clinton proposals,
including income-tax revision. The rejection of that
initiative, in turn, discouraged the governor from pushing an
education package, which would have raised teacher salaries.
But this year's Democratic primaries toppled some of the
governor's most stubborn legislative foes, bettering the odds
for new Clinton initiatives.
   First, though, Mr. Clinton must get himself re-elected in
this traditionally rough-and-tumble state. (A "continual
succession of gentle, fertile, wooded scenery . . .
everything peaceful but man," author Washington Irving summed
up Arkansas in the 19th century.) Gov. Clinton's opponent is
Sheffield Nelson, a Democrat-turned-Republican who's the
former chief executive officer of Arkla Inc., owner of
Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Co. Mr. Nelson, 49, minces few words
in describing the governor as a man who has worn out his
welcome.
   "Bill Clinton would rather climb a tree to tell you a lie
than stand on the ground and tell you the truth," says Mr.
Nelson. "The only reason he's running for governor is to
maintain a foothold on the White House. I think this election
alone will prove that Bill Clinton is not presidential
timber."
   Billboards along the highways hammer home Mr. Nelson's
central theme: "Ten Years is Enough]]" Mr. Clinton was first
elected to a two-year term in 1978, lost his 1980 re-election
bid, then came back to win in 1982, 1984 and 1986, when
Arkansas went to a four-year term. Gov. Clinton acknowledges
that countering the billboard theme is his biggest problem.
   The crux of his problem, says Mr. Clinton, is that polls
show that better than 60% of the voters like his performance
-- but more than 50% of the voters also agree with the
billboard. "I'm taking about a six to eight {percentage}
point hit on the tenure argument," he says. "In theory, if
everybody woke up in a bad mood on election day, I could get
46%. If everybody woke up in a good mood, I could get 60%."
   Challenger Nelson is running straight at Mr. Clinton's
proudest boast, his claim to have been an "education
governor." He was the nation's first governor to impose
teacher-competency tests and has been in the forefront of the
effort to bring computers into classrooms. But Mr. Nelson
notes that Arkansas teacher salaries, always low, have
slipped to 50th in the nation, from 45th, during Mr.
Clinton's present term. Meanwhile, he says, per-capita income
in this chronically poor state was 48th in 1989, up only one
notch from 49th a decade earlier.
   "People do not understand how he could have more than
doubled the state budget and not solved state problems," Mr.
Nelson maintains. Gov. Clinton, arguing that many problems
have been solved, parries the attack with everything from
old-time religion to self-deprecating humor.
   "You know what the Bible says: We all have problems until
we're brought Home," he tells a solemnly nodding audience in
the courthouse square of Clinton, Ark. It is an almost 19th
century campaign scene -- the governor, holding forth beneath
an elm in front of the modest stone courthouse, quoting the
Bible to a gathering that includes old men with sunburned
arms, string ties and straw hats.
   Bantering with another audience, he tells the
perhaps-apocryphal story of an elderly man he encountered on
a campaign stop.
   "I'm going to vote for you," the man announced.
   "I was afraid you might be tired of me by now," Mr.
Clinton responded.
   "No, but everybody else I know is," the man replied.
   Mr. Nelson, an earnest and less-colorful man, has campaign
liabilities of his own. He emerged the winner of a bitter,
name-calling Republican primary contest with the flamboyant
U.S. Rep. Tommy Robinson. The wounds haven't fully healed,
nor are they likely to. Mr. Nelson, who backed Sen. Edward
Kennedy's challenge to President Jimmy Carter in 1980, is
portrayed by Mr. Clinton as a political opportunist. And,
with Gov. Clinton's encouragement, the state Public Service
Commission has reopened a question that dogged Mr. Nelson
during the GOP primary -- whether he, as Arkla's top
executive, asked too little in selling an interest in
undeveloped oil and gas leases in 1983. Arkla wound up buying
back the leases at nearly 15 times the original price,
possibly affecting Arkansas utility customers.
   Ultimately, though, this election is a referendum on Mr.
Clinton. "The 10-years-is-enough argument is a good argument,
if you can point to abuse of power, or corruption, or loss of
energy and ideas," he contends. "None of those things have
happened with me." He sprinkles his speeches with proposals
for the future -- new highways, a state-assisted
apprenticeship program to train skilled workers, an expanded
"boot camp" prison program for nonviolent first offenders.
   And Gov. Clinton candidly acknowledges that he's giving
some thought to the presidential election year of 1996. He
now chairs the Democratic Leadership Council, a national
group trying to wrench his party back toward the center of
the political spectrum, and says the Democrats need a
candidate who'll do the same thing.
   He says he came close to declaring for president in 1987.
"You wonder, when you pass up a deal like that, whether
you'll ever get one again," he says. But he ventures that
"the average political person reaches his or her peak at age
50." If true, that would find Bill Clinton peaking just in
time for 1996.

   NEW YORK -- In one of the largest partnerships between two
separate media companies, Newsweek magazine and Times Mirror
Magazines have joined to create a multimagazine, multimedia
advertising package.
   By offering the package, to be known as the Ad-Vantage
program, Newsweek, owned by Washington Post Co., and Times
Mirror Magazines, a unit of Times Mirror Co., are taking
direct aim at competition from packages offered by such
multimedia companies as Time Warner Inc. While national
advertisers have largely slashed their ad budgets, such
packages try to lure more dollars from advertisers with
discounts offering access to video, print and promotions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ad-Vantage received generally good reactions from
advertising agency media directors, who said it offers an
attractive, heavily male audience, and the ability to buy
time on network TV affiliates and cable systems owned by both
Washington Post Co. and Times Mirror. Advertisers would be
able to create special ad supplements in the magazines and
arrange special events -- such as in-store promotions or
sponsorship of sporting events.
   Times Mirror publishes a number of magazines with heavy
male readership, such as Field &amp; Stream, Outdoor Life, Golf
Magazine, Popular Science and The Sporting News.
   Newsweek is expected to benefit the most from the plan.
For years it has had to compete with Time magazine, whose
parent, Time Warner, can offer attractive multi-magazine ad
packages. "This makes Newsweek stronger," says Peter
Gardiner, senior vice president at DDB Needham Worldwide.
"Their weakness was being a sole publication that couldn't
offer tie-ins to other titles."
   But Michael Drexler, national media director of Bozell
agency, questioned the success of a package targeted so
heavily to male readers. "It's a brilliant scheme, but I
don't think anyone will jump at it right away," he said.
   The timing of the Newsweek-Times Mirror announcement was
crucial: In the coming weeks, ad agencies are planning how
and where they will spend millions in clients' ad dollars in
1991.
   The partnership underscores the cutthroat nature of
magazines' advertising sales as the industry works its way
through an advertising slump. Partnerships are rare among
consumer magazines, since they compete so closely for
advertisers' dollars and readers' time.

   PORTLAND, Ore. -- Nerco Inc. said its oil and gas unit
successfully completed a new development well at its Eugene
Island Block 108 field, 25 miles offshore St. Mary Parish,
La.
   The well is expected to be put into production by early
November. Nerco, a natural resources company, acquired a 61%
operating interest in the field during 1988 and 1989. The
field has eight producing wells, each of which averages about
6.6 million cubic feet of natural gas and 85 barrels of
condensate a day.

   TOKYO -- The Japanese stock market's prolonged decline
accelerated to a drop of nearly 5% Wednesday, with Mideast
tensions apparently playing a significant, direct role.
   Meanwhile, London shares edged up, as prices lost earlier
gains following a sharp drop on Wall Street in late London
trading.

<TEXT>
   For weeks, investors have blamed the sagging Tokyo stock
market on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; the subsequent surge in
oil prices is tough on Japan, which imports almost all of its
energy. Wednesday, however, the investors were blaming Kuwait
itself as the Nikkei Index of 225 stocks plunged 1108.70
points, or 4.75%, to 22250.62.
   In trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index fell
another 222.75 points to close the morning session at
22027.87.
   "Kuwait was really selling" stock, said a salesman at
Nomura Securities Co. A British fund manager put the amount
at 30 billion yen ($219.3 million), spread over Tuesday and
Wednesday. Although government officials have said Kuwait's
government-in-exile has "tens of billions" of dollars in
Japanese stock and bond investments, the selling couldn't be
confirmed.
   "We don't discuss our investments," said a spokeswoman for
the London-based Kuwait Investment Office, the main
investment manager for the exiled Kuwaiti government.
   But the Japanese traders' reports appear to conflict with
Kuwaiti policy announced Friday by Sheik Ali al-Khalifa
al-Sabah, the exiled Kuwait finance minister. At a news
conference, Sheik Ali indicated that his government won't be
selling gold or stocks; instead, he said it will get needed
cash from its own cash reserves and from sales of short-term
market instruments "in various currencies." On Monday,
however, the KIO confirmed that as part of its normal
stock-trading operations it sold a #60 million ($112.2
million) stake in Britain's Mount Charlotte Investments PLC.
   In combination with fresh worries about an outbreak of war
in the Middle East and heavy arbitrage-related selling,
though, the rumors were enough to scotch a rally Wednesday
morning on Tokyo's stock market and batter share prices in
their ninth-biggest single-day decline ever and to their
lowest level in 32 months. The decline compounded a
418.51-point loss Tuesday. The benchmark Nikkei Index now is
off nearly 43% since its record finish of 38915.87 at the end
of 1989.
   Volume remained light at an estimated 350 million shares,
up from 252.6 million shares Tuesday. Some brokers said the
thin trading suggests the market has more room to fall.
"There has to be a certain amount of panic selling before the
market will reach its bottom," a Japanese analyst said.
   Losers widely outnumbered advancers 919 to 54, while 73
issues were unchanged.
   The composite Tokyo Stock Price Index of issues listed on
the first section dropped 67.92 points, or 3.95%, to 1651.44.
   The second section index fell 85.72 points, or 2.61%, to
3194.45. Volume in the section was estimated at five million
shares, up from 3.8 million shares Tuesday.
   On Wednesday, the market opened relatively strongly,
following upswings on Wall Street and in London. But a
Japanese news service report that interpreted remarks by U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker as suggesting that open
conflict with Iraq might be imminent triggered a bout of
selling, which was exacerbated by reports Kuwait was dumping
stock, too. The effect was to unleash a wave of selling.
   "The market is still very shaky," said Hank Sawa, a
strategist for Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd. Even
if there is a technical rebound to Wednesday's drop, he
predicts the market won't touch bottom until the Nikkei Index
hits the psychologically important 20000-point level. If it
falls below 20000, there's no telling where it could stop,
analysts say.
   In large part, that's because of computerized selling
programs. When the market fell below 23000 points Wednesday,
for instance, stop-loss orders by major institutional clients
quickened the pace of selling and rapidly drove the index
down to its closing level.
   That selling exacerbates pressure on individual investors,
who often have borrowed money to buy stocks on margin. They
put up only a small amount of cash, and brokers rely on the
stock they buy as collateral for the rest. If stock prices
fall, the investors have to put up more cash.
   With interest rates rising -- banks plan to raise their
long-term prime lending rate to 8.9% from 8.5% now -- the
need for investors to sell stock to raise cash is increasing,
analysts said.
   Even big corporate news wasn't enough to salvage the
market. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. dropped 70 yen to
1560 yen, despite its confirmation that it is holding talks
about acquiring U.S. film studio MCA Inc. And robot-maker
Fanuc Ltd. dropped 270 yen to 4800 after the company
announced plans to triple production at a new plant to keep
up with strong demand.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share
Index ended up 0.8 point at 2000, under the day's high of
2015.8. The Financial Times 30 Share Index closed up 6 points
at 1532.6. Volume was 410.3 million shares, compared with
412.4 million shares Tuesday.
   Although London remained firm for most of the day, and
comfortably above the 2000 level, traders had warned that a
marked decline on Wall Street would trigger a similar
reaction in London.
   "New York has held up better than London. The recession
there has not been fully appreciated by the U.S. market," one
trader said, adding that Wall Street eventually would fall
lower, bringing London down with it.
   Another poor day on the German stock market, which Tuesday
ended at a 16-month low, also diminished investor confidence
in London, traders said.
   While volume remained thin, traders said that institutions
were picking up small amounts of stock at the lower end of
the market. "This is hardly an expression of confidence in
the market," one trader said. "Institutions are only going to
commit {significant funds} to a rising market," another
trader added.
   The property sector had a strong day. Traders said there
was little turnover in the sector, and prices were simply
being squeezed higher from a shortage of stock. Traders added
that there was a general trend toward interest-rate sensitive
stocks that could stage a fast recovery when U.K. interest
rates eventually fall.
   MEPC PLC, the U.K. property investment and development
group, closed 8 pence higher at 428 pence, while Land
Securities gained 11 pence to 460 pence.
   Leisure industry group Brent Walker finished 7 pence
higher at 144 pence. The company has said its interim results
due Thursday will be in line with expectations, and the
market is generally optimistic, traders said.
   Advertising group WPP Group ended 46 pence lower at 369
pence. Traders said the fall was in line with the rest of the
advertising sector, but was accentuated by reports that WPP
client National Westminster Bank was reconsidering its
advertising strategy. A spokesman for the bank said he
couldn't confirm the reports.
   Profit-taking in the oil sector led to an easing of prices
in that sector, traders said. British Petroleum closed 7
pence lower at 353 pence, and Shell fell 10 pence to 457
pence.
   Associated British Foods, which Wednesday received
clearance from the U.K.'s Department of Trade and Industry to
put forward a proposal to buy assets of Berisford
International, saw its shares end 9 pence higher at 404
pence. Berisford closed 4 pence higher at 36 pence.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Brussels; lower in Stockholm, Helsinki, Oslo, Madrid; and
mixed in Zurich, Amsterdam and Milan. South African gold
stocks closed narrowly mixed.
   Share prices also closed mixed in Seoul, lower in
Wellington, Manila, Taipei, Singapore, Hong Kong and Sydney.

   BUSH IS EXPECTED to request approval for a $7.5 billion
Saudi arms sale.
   The sale would be the first portion of a $20 billion
package that has stirred debate in Washington. Meanwhile, the
U.N. air embargo against Iraq got off to a confused start as
Jordan received Iraqi passenger flights. U.S. officials said
the U.N. might have to clarify the passenger-flight issue. In
Washington, Turkey's Ozal said he would support "armed
intervention" against Iraq, if it becomes necessary, provided
the action is cleared by the U.N. Cheney warned that Saddam
Hussein may try to use military force to break the
"stranglehold" of an international embargo.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush formally notified Congress
that the administration plans to begin negotiating a
free-trade agreement with Mexico, administration officials
said.
   Under U.S. trade laws, the Senate Finance Committee and
the House Ways and Means Committee now have 60 legislative
days to decide whether to allow the negotiations to occur
under "fast-track" procedures. Fast-track authorization is
considered crucial because it prohibits amendments and so
helps prevent any proposed accord from getting bogged down in
Congress.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said a
U.S.-Mexico free-trade agreement "may offer both countries
important economic opportunities." But he added that it is
"critical any free-trade negotiations be analyzed and then
managed carefully," particularly in light of the significant
economic disparties between the U.S. and Mexico.
   In Montreal, Mexican Minister of Industry and Commerce
Jaime Serra said Mexico is seeking a pact that is "similar
but not necessarily the same" as the existing U.S.-Canada
free-trade agreement. Canada has indicated it wants to join
the U.S.-Mexico talks, and Mr. Serra said it is "very likely"
that talks among the three countries will result in a
comprehensive North American free-trade agreement. But he
conceded, "it will be a difficult exercise."
   Mr. Serra and Chilean Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley
agreed recently that their two countries would work to remove
all tariff barriers between them within five years, Mr.
Foxley said in an interview. President Bush is encouraging a
western hemisphere-wide free-trade area.

   Are the Quotations Cooked? Let Juries Decide

   "All journalism is an act of betrayal," according to Janet
Malcolm, the New Yorker reporter whose betrayal of one
interview subject may well provide the most fascinating First
Amendment case in the Supreme Court's next term.
   Actually, Janet Malcolm never quite said that, but the
quotation is pretty close to things she has said. If you
think there's a big difference between quoting what Ms.
Malcolm said and what she almost said, you've probably
already chosen sides in a controversy that has divided
journalists and judges alike as it makes its way through the
courts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On Monday the justices are expected to decide whether to
hear the case, which arises from Janet Malcolm's New Yorker
profile of the former projects director of the Sigmund Freud
Archives, a voluble psychoanalyst named Jeffrey Masson.
Despite long and apparently sympathetic interviews, Ms.
Malcolm's article was highly unflattering -- full of Mr.
Masson making colorfully indiscreet remarks. Mr. Masson sued.
He claimed that the most colorful and indiscreet of his
remarks were really supplied by Ms. Malcolm herself -- that
she had, for example, created from whole cloth a passage in
which he bragged, "I was like an intellectual gigolo" to the
aging Anna Freud.
   Hoping to end the case without a trial, Ms. Malcolm asked
the courts to assume for the sake of argument that she did
make up the quotations. The First Amendment, she argued,
protected her even if she changed Mr. Masson's words, because
Jeffrey Masson was the kind of self-dramatizing loudmouth who
probably would have said these things if he'd had a chance.
For example, to defend her "intellectual gigolo" quotation,
Janet Malcolm pointed to a passage on the tapes in which Mr.
Masson described himself as "a private asset but a public
liability" for Anna Freud.
   Most of us would rather be called either a private asset
or a public liability than a gigolo. But the Court of
Appeals, obviously concerned about the First Amendment
consequences of letting the case go to a jury, said that Ms.
Malcolm's quotation was close enough. As long as her version
was a "rational interpretation" of what Mr. Masson actually
said, she was free to put her own words into his mouth.
   The Court of Appeals got it wrong (at least the majority
did -- Judge Alex Kozinski wrote a devastating dissent).
Wrong not because the court relied on the First Amendment --
the amendment is at the heart of the matter -- but because it
acted as though the press were the only party with a First
Amendment interest at stake.
   When the Bill of Rights was drafted, practically every man
with the inclination could become a pamphleteer. Freedom of
the press was just an offshoot of freedom of speech. Both
were freedoms that allowed every individual to be heard.
   Today's institutionalized press is a far cry from the lone
pamphleteer. Fewer and fewer people have any prospect of
owning or writing for the mass media. Yet in the past 30
years, as control of the press was becoming more
concentrated, the protection the press received in the courts
was growing stronger.
   Why? Because, despite its increasingly concentrated
ownership, today's press still is devoted in the main to
communicating the views of many individuals. We don't read
the papers to find out what the publisher has to say about
the Middle East, but to find out what George Bush has to say,
what Saddam Hussein has to say, what the wives of the 82nd
Airborne and thousands of others have to say.
   We value the press precisely because it brings us the
speech of these thousands of individuals. So when the press
goes to court seeking special constitutional protection we
know that it is also defending the free-speech interests of
thousands who might never be heard without a free press. It
is the value of their speech that often tips the balance in
favor of protecting the press.
   But the press does not have those rights on its side every
time it goes to court. The Court of Appeals erred because it
didn't see that when a reporter or a publisher puts his own
words into someone else's mouth, he ceases to be the ally of
all those thousands of individual speakers. He becomes their
enemy -- and his readers' as well. When we read a reporter's
summary of someone else's remarks, no matter how
dispassionate, we know we are getting the news through a
filter, and we make allowances. That's why quotations are so
powerful. They tell us that we're getting the speaker's words
direct, without an intermediary.
   Or at least that's what we thought before the Masson case.
Now we can't be sure.
   Under the lower court's rule, we may be getting only the
reporter's "rational interpretation" of the speaker's words,
an interpretation later dressed up in quotation marks to add
drama and disguise the reporter's hand.
   Perhaps Janet Malcolm and reporters like her should be
free to alter quotations and argue later that the words they
used were "close enough" -- that they captured the spirit if
not the letter of the speaker's remarks. Sometimes that will
be true. And sometimes their changes will reflect something
less admirable -- perhaps even a deliberate attempt to
mislead.
   Deciding whether the altered quotations are poetic license
or deceit depends on a weighing of all the facts -- precisely
the kind of job that juries do every day in our judicial
system.
   There is no reason to take such questions away from the
jury on First Amendment grounds. With First Amendment
interests on both sides of the scale, the courts should treat
a reporter who has altered quotations no better and no worse
than any other tradesman accused of peddling fraudulent
goods.

parties filing briefs in the Masson case.

   McALLEN, Texas -- A federal bankruptcy judge refused to
force Greyhound Lines Inc. to turn over financial data to a
potential buy-out group that includes the striking
Amalgamated Transit Union.
   Judge Richard Schmidt also extended to Nov. 19 from Oct. 2
the time during which Greyhound has the exclusive right to
present a reorganization plan to creditors.

   The union was seeking to force the bus company to open its
books to Blackstone Group, a New York investment banking firm
that has joined the union in an effort to buy the company, as
a condition of the extension. Blackstone Group had told the
union that it needed the financial data to proceed with its
plans. Shelby Jordan, who represents the union, acknowledged
in court that the judge's decision could "really freeze"
Blackstone's efforts.
   But Judge Schmidt said, "I don't think that that's a
proper way to do that." He pointed out that Blackstone or any
other potential suitor could obtain financial information
when Greyhound files its disclosure statements and
reorganization plan in November.
   In another setback for the union, major bondholders in the
case supported Greyhound's stand against making the
disclosures to Blackstone. Both the union and the company
have been engaged in aggressive efforts to obtain
bondholders' support. Moreover, the bondholders succeeded in
getting three seats on the unsecured creditors' committee,
which had previously consisted of union representatives and
trade creditors. Lawyers involved in the case said that could
dilute union influence on the committee.
   Mr. Jordan, the ATU lawyer, said the union intended to
file additional motions asking the judge to release the
financial information to Blackstone.
