   Irwin Jacobs, Once Feared as a Raider,
   Now Looks to Set Up a `Friendly' Fund

   Onetime corporate raider Irwin Jacobs says he's turning
"friendly."
   Mr. Jacobs, whose hostile takeover efforts once made him a
feared name in many corporate suites, now is putting together
an investment fund to help cash-strapped companies right
themselves. If necessary, he'll even contribute some
management know-how.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Similar to other investment vehicles now combing through
debris of the junk-bond collapse, Mr. Jacobs's World Fund
L.P. is designed as a limited-partnership investment for
wealthy individuals and other sophisticated investors from
around the world.
   But several others with the same idea have run into
financing problems themselves. For example, Forstmann, Little
&amp; Co., a big player in the leveraged buy-out game, has been
struggling to raise $2 billion from pension funds and
insurance companies for a similar fund.
   Although his fund is in the formative stages -- there's no
prospectus yet -- Mr. Jacobs envisions the fund as having
perhaps as much as a billion dollars to invest, but only on
good terms. "No unfriendly transactions -- which may sound
strange to some people," concedes Mr. Jacobs, who once had a
pirate ship made from the beer cans of a brewery he
unsuccessfully fought to acquire.
   To prove he's not just talk, Mr. Jacobs yesterday offered
to pump perhaps $20 million into Munsingwear Inc., a
struggling apparel maker within view of his Minneapolis
office. If Munsingwear accepts, the investor would put $8
million in cash in the corporate coffers in exchange for an
80% equity ownership. Also, he would offer to buy out other
shareholders at $2 a share, a price that, before his bid was
announced, represented a premium.
   Munsingwear closed yesterday at $2, up 12.5 cents, in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading. The Jacobs deal
also calls for Munsingwear debtholders to agree to sell $34
million in 8% debt at no more than 25% of face value. That
price also would represent a premium, because the debt was
trading yesterday at $21 to $23 for each $100 face value.
   Munsingwear, Mr. Jacobs says, is a good example of the
opportunities he thinks will proliferate in coming months.
While its continuing operations are losing money, "there's a
nucleus there to build something beyond where they are, to
bring back the heritage they once had," he added, dismissing
the likelihood of an asset sale.
   "We're no threat to the management," Mr. Jacobs insists.
   Still, he's not planning to be simply a passive investor
who says to management, "We trust you." "Our people will be
involved, to be sure our investments will be handled
properly," he says.
   Certain opportunities will be shunned, though. Vowing a
"very conservative" approach, Mr. Jacobs says his fund would
avoid businesses "that we think are too highly leveraged and
have no possibility of being able to service their debt."
   A big investment fund isn't a new idea for the investor.
He talked about one in 1985, shortly after he pulled off what
has proven to be his biggest hostile takeover, the
acquisition of AMF Inc. At the time, Mr. Jacobs said numerous
overseas investors had approached him looking for ways to
come aboard the takeover train.
   But soon leveraged buy-out specialists such as Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. had replaced individual raiders, so for
several years Mr. Jacobs has maintained a relatively low
profile, occasionally going after a small company, but
concentrating on melding his various operating companies into
solid, if dull, moneymakers.
   His portfolio of businesses includes Watkins Products
Inc., a household products distributor; Insty-Prints copies;
Brown Minneapolis Tank Co.; and several regional boat makers
that he has merged into Genmar Industries Inc., now believed
to be his largest entity.
   If his hopes for World Fund develop, Mr. Jacobs plans to
use it to "go into industries where we can have a major
foothold." He didn't elaborate.

   American General Proxy-Vote Victory
   Wouldn't End Pressure to Lift Stock Price

   American General Corp. is likely to remain under pressure
to put itself up for sale or take other action to boost its
stock price whether or not the Houston-based insurer wins a
proxy vote at its annual meeting today.
   Five out of eight institutional investors surveyed
yesterday said they are voting for directors nominated by
Torchmark Corp., a smaller insurer based in Birmingham, Ala.,
that made and withdrew a $50-a-share, $6.3 billion bid for
American General.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More ominous for American General Chairman Harold Hook,
two of the three institutions backing management's directors
said they also favor a Torchmark resolution that the company
should be sold. Although nonbinding, a big vote for the
measure could keep management under pressure to maximize the
company's stock price.
   Wall Street stock traders say the outcome of the vote,
which may be close, is difficult to predict. Normally,
stockholders favor a challenger who has made a credible
offer. But Torchmark withdrew its bid to avoid getting
ensnarled in state rules limiting insurance takeovers. "This
is a hybrid," said one trader.
   Separately, a Tennessee federal court yesterday blocked
enforcement of an order issued Monday by a Tennessee state
official barring Torchmark from soliciting votes for the
contest. The federal court news sparked a surge in American
General stock, which rose $1.125 a share to $40.125 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Before the ruling, Torchmark had defied the order and
continued soliciting votes, arguing that the order was
illegal.
   Although only six of American General's 15 directors are
up for re-election because the board has staggered terms,
traders believe a significant minority of dissident directors
can stir up enough trouble to force a sale of the company. To
avoid that, American General might pursue either a friendly
acquirer or a recapitalization or restructuring to try to
boost its stock price.
   Just last week, the threat of a proxy victory by a
dissident minority slate sparked the $1.9 billion sale of
Worcester, Mass., abrasives maker Norton Co. to Cie. de
Saint-Gobain, a French glass concern that saved Norton from a
hostile bid by BTR PLC, a British conglomerate.
   Torchmark is the third major corporation in the last six
months to use the one-two punch of a bid and proxy fight to
try to break down a target's anti-takeover defenses.
Georgia-Pacific Corp. did so in acquiring Great Northern
Nekoosa Inc., and BTR used it on Norton.
   If the vote is close, or if management is losing, American
General may not announce the result for two or three weeks.
If Torchmark loses, the result may become known quickly.
   The institutions that plan to vote for Torchmark include:
the Michigan State Treasurer, with 2.8 million shares; New
York State Teachers Retirement System, 1.3 million shares;
Capital Research &amp; Management Co. in Los Angeles, with 1.3
million shares at year-end 1989; Brandywine Asset Management
Inc. in Wilmington, Del., 600,000 shares, and State of
Wisconsin Investment Board, 446,600 shares.
   Michigan Treasurer Robert Bowman said he believes the
Torchmark nominees "would do the most to enhance the values
of American General, either by putting together a sale to
Torchmark at $50 a share, or if that doesn't pan out to
emulate Torchmark's good record."
   Darin Klemm, an analyst at the Wisconsin Investment Board,
said, "We don't believe that American General has performed
at a satisfactory level, and they haven't shown us a plan to
improve this."
   Investors that said they planned to vote for American
General Management included the Texas Teacher Retirement
System, with 1.1 million shares, California Public Employees
Retirement System, with 916,000 shares, and another
institution that asked to remain unidentified.
   Joseph Perrone, chief investment officer of the Texas
Teacher fund, said he hopes today's vote will encourage the
two companies to explore a friendly merger "to capitalize on
each other's strengths."
   But another holder, who asked to remain unidentified,
objected to Torchmark's tactics in giving American General
only 48 hours to consider its bid before withdrawing it. "We
don't think the future of the company should be decided on
ultimatums like that," he said.
   Even though several institutions sided publicly with
Torchmark, the outcome remains uncertain because many of the
largest holders wouldn't discuss their votes.
   For example, some analysts believe Fayez Sarofim, a money
manager who owned 6 million shares at the end of 1989, may
vote for American General because he is based in Houston, the
company's hometown. Mr. Sarofim didn't respond to requests
for comment.
   Also, an American General employee savings plan holding
more than 4 million shares is expected to side with
management. American General has 119.2 million shares
outstanding.
   The largest stock holder, American Financial Corp. with
9.1 million shares, won't influence the outcome because it
has an agreement with American General that its shares will
be voted in the same proportion as shares it doesn't own.

   NEWTON, Mass. -- Cahners Publishing Co., which has been on
a buying binge of U.S. magazines, hired veteran magazine
publisher John J. Beni to pursue more acquisitions and
start-ups of consumer publications.
   Mr. Beni, 58 years old, was named senior vice president
and general manager of Cahners's Consumer Magazine division.
He had been president and publisher of New York Times Co.
Magazine Group's McCall's magazine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cahners Publishing is the U.S. publishing subsidiary of
London-based Reed International PLC. Cahners publishes 65
trade magazines and newspapers, as well as 10 consumer
magazines, such as Modern Bride and American Baby. In 1989,
Cahners's trade and consumer publications had revenue of $500
million.
   Backed by Reed's deep pockets, Cahners has paid premium
prices for new U.S. properties in recent years. In 1987,
Cahners paid Diamandis Communications Inc. $64 million for
Modern Bride. In 1989, it paid $825 million for News Corp's
travel and hotel industry publications and electronic
publishing properties.
   Mr. Beni, who was once president of Gruner + Jahr U.S.A.
Publishing, said Cahners is in the midst of negotiating
acquisitions of existing magazines as well as spinning off
new magazines from existing titles. Cahners spun off Health
Kids magazine from American Baby and, most recently, Your
Prom magazine from Modern Bride. Most Cahners magazines are
distributed largely on newsstands or under controlled
circulation, such as to doctors' waiting rooms.
   "We are looking for line extensions based on our existing
publications," said Mr. Beni. He added that possible new
magazines could come from Cahners's Modern Bride and its
boating group of trade titles. As for acquisitions, Mr. Beni
said, "If there is anything out there that is a good fit, the
money will be there to buy it, be it one magazine, or a
collection of magazines."

   MAYNARD,Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp. is negotiating an
equity investment and technology agreement with fast-growing
software maker Ingres Corp.
   Ingres, the Alameda, Calif.-based software developer,
which changed its name last year from Relational Technology
Inc., had sales of $130.7 million in the fiscal year ended
June 30. It develops relational data base software for
Digital computers and other computer designs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Digital spokesman said the two companies are discussing
"both a technology and a business partnership" that would
result in a minority investment by Digital.
   Digital rarely makes investments in other companies,
though it has broken that tradition recently for access to
new technologies. Last year, it bought a 5.7% stake in chip
maker MIPS Computer Systems Co., Sunnyvale, Calif., and it
holds warrants to purchase up to 18%.
   Digital is especially interested in Ingres's software for
Unix, an increasingly popular computer operating system
developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and viewed as
"open" because it is widely licensed by AT&amp;T to others.
Digital has become increasingly aggressive in the Unix market
in the past year, as sales of its proprietary VAX line have
slowed.
   Separately, Digital unveiled a suite of software products
designed to allow its computers to work easily with computers
made by Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif.
   The products tying the two companies' computers together
are the first to emerge from a widely heralded technology
alliance disclosed two years ago. They were announced in New
York by Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's president, and Apple
Chief Executive Officer John Sculley.
   Digital will market the products, which among other
capabilities allow Digital computers to be used as file
servers tying together networks of Apple Macintosh computers.
The software packages make it possible to share data,
electronic mail, printers and other devices.

   Your Money Matters -- Investment Dartboard:
   Stock-Picking Pros Again Beat the Darts

   Led by small-stock specialist Jonathan Steinberg, a
quartet of investment professionals once again trounced a
randomly selected "dart" portfolio in this column's
stock-picking contest.
   Mr. Steinberg, editor and publisher of Individual Investor
magazine and son of raider-financier Saul Steinberg, scored a
9% gain with his April selection, Image Entertainment Inc. It
followed his victorious pick for March, American Film
Technologies Inc., which has risen 58% in the two months
since he picked it at the beginning of March.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   April's brigade of investment pros averaged a 3.7% gain
for the month, while a group of four stocks chosen by tossing
darts at the New York Stock Exchange listings fell 12.7%. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average sagged 1.9%.
   The biggest loser among the dart stocks was Caesar's
World, a casino company faced with tough new competition from
Donald Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and Golden Nugget
Inc.'s Mirage casino in Las Vegas. The investment pros have
now beaten the darts in 14 of 19 monthly outings.
   Mr. Steinberg's new pick is Management Co. Entertainment
Group, a Santa Monica, Calif., film producer and distributor
whose most recent film is "Look Who's Talking." Traded over
the counter, the stock ended yesterday at $2.25 a share, bid.
Mr. Steinberg recommends purchasing it at any price up to
$4.50. "I think in 18 months it will be between $7 and $11,"
he says.
   Last year, Management Co. Entertainment Group acquired
Virgin Vision Ltd., a British-based international
film-distribution company. Revenue, a mere $34 million in
fiscal 1989, will be $330 million in fiscal 1991, Mr.
Steinberg figures.
   "It is extremely undervalued," he says. "Most production
companies trade at one-and-a-half to three times sales. This
company trades at about 60% of sales, and sales are growing
fast. If it trades at one times sales by the end of 1991, the
stock would be at $11."
   To finance its growth, the company has taken on about $153
million of debt, Mr. Steinberg notes, including a $72 million
bridge loan from Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "There's been downward
pressure on the stock because of the bridge loan," Mr.
Steinberg says. But yesterday, the company and Kidder
announced that the bridge loan will be extended on more
favorable terms.
   Returning to the contest this month is R. Jerry Falkner,
director of research for Gulfstream Financial Associates Inc.
(a unit of Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, which is part of Kemper
Corp.). At the beginning of February, he recommended
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., then selling for $14.125 a
share. Blockbuster ended April at $19.75, a 40% gain that
earns Mr. Falkner a return trip.
   His pick now: Windmere Corp., a Miami-based maker of small
electrical appliances, especially hair-care products. Almost
everything that could go wrong for Windmere has gone wrong in
the past year, Mr. Falkner says. For starters, many of its
factories are in China, the scene of a bloody political
crackdown by the Communist regime against pro-democracy
demonstrators. Windmere also damaged its credibility on Wall
Street by issuing overly optimistic earnings predictions, Mr.
Falkner says.
   But now, he thinks the stock is "very oversold," having
plunged to a recent $5.75 a share from a 1989 high of $29; it
closed yesterday at $5.875 in Big Board composite trading.
Mr. Falkner would pay up to $7 a share.
   Windmere, which has annual sales of about $180 million,
recently won a $90 million jury award in an antitrust suit
against N.V. Philips, the big Dutch company that Windmere
says forced it out of the market for three-head rotary
shavers. Philips plans to appeal, but Mr. Falkner says, "We
think {Windmere} has a very high probability of receiving
that money."
   Even without lawsuit proceeds, Mr. Falkner says, Windmere
shares are selling below their book value (assets minus
liabilities per share) of about $7.50. "We think they lost
some market share last year {though the company denies it},
but we think they're recovering," he concludes.
   Two new stock-pickers join the fun this month. Lawrence A.
Cisneros is president of San Juan Asset Management Inc. in
Huntington Beach, Calif. Michael G. Seyfer is president of
Starmont Capital Ltd. in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Mr. Cisneros suggests buying shares of Service Corp.
International, based in Houston, which owns a national chain
of some 500 funeral homes and more than 100 cemeteries. The
shares sold yesterday for $16.50 in Big Board composite
trading; Mr. Cisneros would buy them up to $18.50.
   Several things attract him to the stock: Service Corp. is
selling off divisions that haven't pulled their weight
(prearranged funerals and funeral supplies). It plans to buy
back shares in June. And its business is "interest-rate
resistant and resistant to economic downturns."
   Service Corp. stumbled through hasty and perhaps excessive
expansion, Mr. Cisneros says. But now he thinks "management's
taken the necessary steps to get it back on track," and he's
looking for annual earnings growth of 15% to 20%.
   Mr. Seyfer likes Hecla Mining Co., a producer of gold,
silver and industrial minerals based in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho.
Hecla shares closed unchanged yesterday at $11.625 on the Big
Board. Mr. Seyfer says he'd buy at prices up to $12, but
wouldn't chase the stock up.
   "I think silver under $5 {an ounce} is really attractive,"
he says. "You have to go back to the late 1970s to see the
price much under that." He thinks it's a good sign that Hecla
"bit the bullet" and took write-offs on some inactive mining
properties last year.
   But mostly, he views Hecla as a play on precious-metal
prices. As he sees it, a "more normal price" of $5.50 to $6
an ounce for silver, which "may take a while" to achieve,
would make Hecla's profits perk up. "The price of silver is
reflected in their bottom line very quickly."
   For May, the pros will be up against a dartboard portfolio
consisting of Borden Inc., Gillette Co., Leggett &amp; Platt Inc.
and National City Corp.

   Co-Chief Arthur Ross
   To Leave VPI Unit

   NEW YORK -- Arthur Ross, president and co-chief executive
officer of Carter Organization Inc., will leave the proxy
solicitation firm in several months, as part of a
cost-cutting move.
   Carter, which is owned by VPI Group PLC of Britain, has
been hurt by the slowdown in merger-and-acquisition activity.
And just last March, the firm's founder and former chairman,
Don Carter, pleaded guilty to charges of grand larceny and
personal income-tax evasion. Following the plea, Mr. Carter
was fired.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Ross, however, said the firm's troubles aren't linked
to Mr. Carter's situation. "There's no direct cause and
effect," he said. Though there have been almost no client
defections, the 48-year-old Mr. Ross said, "It's fair to say
our business could be stronger."
   Mr. Ross, whose duties are largely administrative, said
his resignation was part of a staff reduction that focused on
the administrative side of the business.
   Mr. Ross, who has been with Carter since 1985, is one of
several people -- he wouldn't say how many -- who will leave
the firm in the next few months. As of last Friday, Carter
had slightly more than 100 employees. Simon Strauss,
executive vice president of VPI N.A., the North American
holding company, and senior vice president of Carter, also
will leave.
   Mr. Ross said he will remain for several months through a
transition, and work with Dennis Mensch, co-chief executive,
who is responsible for client services. Whether a successor
is named will be decided later.
   Mr. Mensch, 37 years old, said Mr. Ross "participated
fully in this decision."
   Mr. Carter, the former chairman who entered the guilty
plea, faces as long as four years in state prison. State
officials have said that behind Mr. Carter's plea was "a
systematic pattern of greed and fraud" involving the
overcharging and false billing of corporate clients at
Carter, which Mr. Carter founded in 1974. As part of his plea
agreement, Mr. Carter is to put $1 million in escrow to
reimburse wronged clients, which officials said included
firms such as Caesars World Inc. and MacAndrews &amp; Forbes
Holdings Inc., parent of Revlon Inc.

   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. extended sales incentives for
most of its 1990 cars and trucks, offering customers the
choice of cash rebates of as much as $1,500 or financing
rates as low as 6.9%.
   The latest program, which began yesterday and expires May
31, replaces one that ended Monday. The new 1991 Ford Escort,
which went on sale at Ford dealerships last week, isn't
included in the new program. The cash incentive of $1,000 on
the leftover 1990 Escort was unchanged from last month's
program, a Ford spokesman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There were some minor changes in the program. Ford, for
example, increased rebates on the Ford Probe by $500 to
$1,500 but it decreased incentives on the Crown Victoria by
$200 to $750.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Federal Budget Pinch May Cut Amount of `Pork'
   To Colleges Living Off of the Fat of the Land

   WASHINGTON -- What a year for the Runnin' Rebels.
   Not only did the University of Nevada at Las Vegas take
the national basketball championship, it won the Pork Bowl
too. UNLV received $13 million in federal funds because of
its political connections this year, edging out Louisiana
State University for the top spot among colleges and
universities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're delighted," says John Unrue, UNLV's provost, who
objects to the term "pork" but likes what federal dollars buy
-- a new supercomputer and an environmental research
laboratory.
   Academic pork fattens up about 100 institutions of higher
learning, which have collected at least $1.2 billion in
special congressional allocations for buildings and research
over the past decade. But the trough isn't as full these
days, largely because of the federal budget crunch and the
determined opposition of such lawmakers as Georgia Democrat
Sam Nunn, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Pork-minded colleges depend on the largess of the
congressional appropriations committees, prodded by
influential lawmakers, to earmark funds for special academic
projects. In the current fiscal year, Congress earmarked
$132.4 million for such projects -- down 35% from the year
before, according to James Savage, a University of Virginia
government professor who tracks academic pork. He predicts it
will drop below $100 million in the coming fiscal year.
"There's a backlash against earmarking," he says.
   One sign of the backlash is the fall-off in funds for
projects backed by Cassidy &amp; Associates Inc., a big
university lobbying firm that was attacked by Appropriations
Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.). Cassidy's college
clients reaped only $14.8 million in pork-barrel allocations
this year -- down from $82.9 million the year before, based
on Mr. Savage's figures. (A Cassidy spokesman says that in
the current fiscal year, the firm's clients received $55
million in university and hospital projects, but he didn't
provide a figure just for universities, or comparable figures
for the year before.)
   If the budget squeeze finally eases, however, pork will
probably start sizzling again. The appetite certainly is
gluttonous. The House Appropriations Committee's agriculture
panel is reviewing two dozen requests to set up international
trade centers at institutions of higher learning. The
committee's energy and water panel, long the biggest pork
purveyor in Congress, has about 20 requests for university
projects, worth about $200 million.
   "I hope to get back to accommodating the colleges," says
Rep. Tom Bevill, the Alabama Democrat who heads the energy
and water subcommittee.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee's top members have
made schools in their states the decade's champion porkers.
West Virginia University, represented by Sen. Byrd and, for
three years by Cassidy, is number one, raking in $67.9
million. Oregon Health Sciences University, through the
efforts of Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield, the committee's ranking
Republican, is number two with $62.4 million. With all the
new construction at Oregon Health Sciences, the school says
that it is now the fourth largest employer in Portland. "I
make sure that Oregon has the ability to compete," says Sen.
Hatfield.
   Pork projects aren't judged by panels of experts, called
peer review, as is traditionally done with research grants to
weed out less-deserving projects. "Where's the quality
control?" with pork projects, asks Erich Bloch, director of
the National Science Foundation. "With peer review, there's
quality control on the research."
   But pork-minded lawmakers deride peer review as a scam
designed to keep research funds concentrated at a few dozen
schools. "There's an old-boys' club that has operated for too
long in university research," charges Sen. Hatfield.
   Now, with the budget crunch, these lawmakers must search
for new sources of funds. Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of
Nevada mined a proposed nuclear-waste dump, which is to be
established in his state's Yucca Mountain, for $13 million
for Nevada colleges this year, and got them $3 million more
through an environmental money bill. The state fiercely
opposes the dump and has passed a law making it illegal to
store high-level radioactive waste in Nevada, but its
colleges are happy to accept the goodies that come with
overseeing the dump. Sen. Reid won a Cray YMP supercomputer
for UNLV, and $3 million in research grants for the
University of Nevada system and its Reno campus.
   He argues that accepting the money doesn't mean accepting
the dump. "All these years they {the federal government} have
been blowing up our desert" at the nuclear-weapons test site
"and we've got nothing for it," Sen. Reid complains. Now "we
got the supercomputer, and we're not going to get the dump."
   Some lawmakers' deals have gone sour. Rep. William Natcher
(D., Ky.), one of the rare appropriations subcommittee
chairmen who usually opposes academic pork, first rebuffed a
bid last year by Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of
Kansas to win $5 million for a new laboratory at the
University of Kansas. So Sen. Dole shopped around until he
found a congressional panel that agreed to authorize the
project, and that was enough to convince Rep. Natcher to try
to fund the deal. His appropriations subcommittee set up a
$15 million construction fund that Mr. Natcher says he
figured would be enough to cover the Kansas lab, a
laboratory-mice breeding facility favored by Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), and a cancer center
pushed by Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.). "I said, `You get
it {the projects} authorized and we'll put the money in and
tell them downtown that they should approve it,'" Rep.
Natcher recalls.
   But the folks downtown -- in this case, the National
Institutes of Health -- evidently weren't listening closely
or the lawmaker didn't speak loudly enough. NIH started a
program in which the Kansas and Colorado projects would have
to compete with a dozen other proposals for a total of only
$5 million -- nearly assuring that Sen. Dole won't get the
money he wants. A spokesman for Mr. Dole says the senator
hasn't decided yet whether to push this year for a special
allocation for the laboratory.
   Whatever Mr. Dole decides, others surely will push for new
projects. A Cassidy spokesman, for example, says his firm is
still hunting for $15 million for an engineering center at
Lehigh University that was stricken from last year's defense
appropriations bill.
   "These are capital-fund drives for universities that don't
want to turn to their alumni," says Sen. John Danforth, a
Missouri Republican who has long opposed pork. "Come to
Washington; it's a horn of plenty."

   SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea had a trade deficit of
US$390 million in April, the fourth consecutive monthly gap
but the smallest since January, though it widened from a $19
million deficit a year earlier, the Trade and Industry
Ministry said.
   Deficits for January, February and March all exceeded $600
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For January through April, the trade balance showed a
deficit of $2.33 billion, compared with a surplus of $39
million a year earlier. The four-month aggregate surpassed
the government's year-end projection of $2 billion in
deficits.
   In April, exports totaled $4.96 billion, up 3.8% from a
year earlier, and imports jumped 12% to $5.36 billion. In the
four months, exports rose only 0.1% to $18.87 billion, and
imports soared 13% to $21.2 billion.

   Bulldozers run riot, ripping scars in the land and
belching fumes in the air. What kind of place is it?
   How about, Acres for Wildlife.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's the new name slapped on 700 acres of land north of
Peoria, Ill., owned by Caterpillar Inc. Every day is Earth
Day at the site, which the heavy-equipment maker uses to
demonstrate its bulldozers, wheel loaders and other giant
yellow machines. (Once or twice a decade, the company also
holds its big Power Parade at the area; thousands come to
watch a mammoth demonstration of Cat machines weighing as
much as 100 tons.)
   But besides customers and special visitors, the site has
also been attracting uninvited guests: poachers stalking deer
in the surrounding woods. So a Cat service technician
proposed making the whole area part of the state's
acres-for-wildlife program. The designation allows Cat to
post "Illinois Acres for Wildlife" above its "No Trespassing"
signs, telling poachers they are doubly unwelcome.
   Max Runkle, a district wildlife biologist for the state,
was skeptical at first. The preservation program, created to
recognize landowners who set aside property for wildlife,
usually is used by farmers.
   But Mr. Runkle says a tour of the site convinced him that
Cat was a worthy recipient of the designation. As if on cue,
half a dozen deer showed up at the side of the road. He says
he found much of Cat's property "a basic panorama of
Midwestern Illinois," with woods and fields flowing over the
hilly terrain.
   As for the diesel fumes wafting through those hills, the
biologist says Cat's demo activity isn't "ongoing or
intensive." And he and company officials also point out that
the demonstration area is only about 15% of the 700 acres Cat
owns.
   Because ground clawed bare by earth-moving equipment tends
to erode, Cat digs ponds at low spots in the area to collect
the runoff. It then moves the recaptured dirt back to the
demo site. "A lot of people think our tractors just tear up
the earth, but Cat machines do a lot to enhance the
environment, too," a company official asserts in an employee
newsletter heralding the wildlife designation.
   And what about the noise?
   Tom Potts, the Cat technician who suggested the
wildlife-acres idea, says the deer don't seem to mind. "They
get used to heavy equipment. As long as you don't bother
them, they stand out and watch you."

   Technology and Health:
   Irradiating Poultry
   To Curb Bacteria
   Approved by FDA

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved
the use of irradiation to control salmonella and other
bacteria in poultry believed partly to blame for rising rates
of food-borne illness.
   FDA scientists described irradiation as a safe and
effective process for, in effect, pasteurizing solid foods.
As in the heat-pasteurization of milk, they said, zapping
poultry with X-rays, gamma radiation or electron radiation
greatly reduces, but doesn't eliminate, all bacteria. Thus,
although irradiated poultry would be safe longer than
untreated poultry, it would still require refrigeration, just
as pasteurized milk does.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite FDA assurances that irradiation doesn't make food
radioactive or expose consumers to radiation, the poultry
industry expects consumer resistance to be a problem.
   "It would be fair to say at this time that you won't see
companies jumping to take advantage of this technology, not
unless they feel the consumer will buy the product," said
Stephen Pretanik, science director for the National Broiler
Council, a trade group for major chicken processors. "There's
an element out there that is going to fight this."
   Mr. Pretanik said that a consumer-education effort by
government and industry is needed to overcome "a lot of
misunderstanding and misinformation" about irradiation. Roger
Coleman, spokesman for the National Food Processors
Association, added, "The issue is consumer acceptance."
   FDA approval had been sought by the Agriculture
Department, which is responsible for inspecting meat and
poultry products, and by RTI Inc., a Rockaway, N.J., company
engaged in food irradiation. "This will allow industry a
chance to use this new technology if it chooses to," said
James Greene, a department spokesman.
   The department is particularly concerned about such
food-borne pathogens as salmonella and campylobacter, major
causes of illnesses. Poultry accounted for almost 10% of the
illnesses in U.S. outbreaks that were traced to a food source
between 1973 and 1987. FDA scientists estimate that almost
every American becomes sick from eating tainted food once
every year or so. The illnesses range from a stomachache to
an incapacitating, and sometimes fatal, attack.
   The FDA already has authorized limited uses of irradiation
to inhibit sprouting in potatoes, retard spoilage in produce,
and control insects in herbs, spices, grains and other foods.
   The latest approval was based in part on studies in which
lab animals were put on diets containing irradiated poultry.
Irradiation at the relatively low levels approved reduces the
number of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria but doesn't
sterilize the poultry, FDA officials said. As a result,
poultry products would continue to require proper handling
and refrigeration by retailers and consumers to prevent
surviving organisms from multiplying.

   Bush Again Expresses Concern Over Cost
   Of S&amp;L Bailout; New FDIC Head Sought

   WASHINGTON -- The White House again expressed concern
about the rising cost of the savings-and-loan bailout and
said it is beginning the process of picking a new leader of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to handle it.
   "We certainly are concerned about additional costs, and it
seems clear there will be higher costs than originally
estimated," said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. "We
don't have agreement on how much they will be."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The White House voiced similar concerns several weeks ago,
after Congress's General Accounting Office estimated that the
bailout's cost would be significantly higher than originally
estimated. Subsequently, President Bush met FDIC Chairman
William Seidman to discuss the price tag for the bailout. Mr.
Seidman also met privately last week with White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu, Bush administration aides said.
   Mr. Seidman has said he intends to leave his FDIC post
before his term expires next year, and Mr. Fitzwater
suggested that Mr. Bush hasn't tried to stop him from
leaving. The spokesman said that while a firm departure date
hasn't been set, the White House has begun internal
discussions about a successor for Mr. Seidman. Other
officials said it's likely to be several weeks before a firm
list of candidates is completed.
   Under last year's huge thrift-industry restructuring law,
the FDIC was given authority over the thrift
deposit-insurance fund and the Resolution Trust Corp., which
was created to merge and sell insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   Mr. Seidman has irritated Bush administration officials
with his outspoken assertions that the S&amp;L bailout probably
would be far more costly than the administration's official
estimate of $166 billion over 10 years. The FDIC chairman's
style has earned him plaudits among Democrats, though, and
some of them yesterday urged President Bush to ask him to
stay.
   Administration aides say the White House has begun
increasing its "focus" on the festering problem of failing
thrifts. White House aides largely delegated the matter to
the Treasury Department after the Bush administration
completed the S&amp;L legislation last August.
   Since then, though, it's become clear that the
administration's cost estimates for the bailout weren't
realistic. Last month, the GAO, Congress's investigative arm,
said the 10-year cost of the bailout likely will be roughly
$243 billion, not $166 billion as the administration
initially suggested. The GAO also said the cost over 30 years
should reach $325 billion, rather than the $257 billion that
the agency itself once estimated.
   White House officials say they don't have the time or
staff to oversee the thrift bailout, but they seem resigned
to devoting more attention to the problem in the next few
months.
   Mr. Seidman has said many times that he won't stay for his
entire term, and Mr. Fitzwater said the White House will be
looking for "new leadership there that will carry out an
aggressive program" when the chairman leaves.
   Mr. Seidman hasn't said precisely when he will be going,
but it seems that he will want to stay through the end of
June. By that time, the Resolution Trust Corp. hopes to have
sold 141 more ailing S&amp;Ls, which would represent a big
acceleration. Only about 60 have been sold so far.
   Separately, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) urged Mr.
Seidman to renegotiate some government-backed S&amp;L sales that
occurred nearly two years ago. Sen. Metzenbaum said that a
recently discovered memo indicates it would have been cheaper
to liquidate a group of five Texas thrifts, rather than sell
them to New York financier Ronald Perelman.
   In a February 1989 memorandum to the president of the Home
Loan Bank of Dallas, a lower-level regulator contended that
regulators overstated the cost of liquidation by $1.8 billion
at the time the deal was made in December 1988. "In my
opinion the {agency} has grossly overstated the liquidation
cost estimate," said the memo from regulatory analyst Jeff
Potter.
   The transaction has emerged as the most controversial of
nearly 100 government thrift sales struck in 1988. It
included about $5 billion in assistance to a newly created
thrift, First Gibraltar Bank, over 10 years, as well as
nearly $1 billion more in tax breaks for Mr. Perelman's
holding company, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Inc. Renegotiating the
deal could involve such things as paying off high-interest
government notes, to reduce the cost to taxpayers.

   Concerning your March 23 page-one article on Orbital
Sciences Corp: It would seem the press is unable to portray
those who seek to develop space as anything but "Space Nuts."
In fact, Orbital Sciences is a small but robust company that
has conservatively paced its growth and ambitions. Reducing
the efforts and success of more than 500 employees, over many
years, to an almost cartoonlike depiction is a gross
injustice to both OSC and all those entrepreneurial companies
that strive to create value in the use of space.

   THOMAS COOK, the New York-based travel agency, yesterday
unveiled a do-it-yourself booking service for corporate
customers.
   With the service, customers call into a computer, which
then asks a series of scheduling and price questions. The
caller responds by pressing the numbers on a push-button
phone. The agency then faxes a list of the available flights
and fare information from all different carriers to the
caller.
   The faxed information includes up to seven outbound and
seven return flights, to make 49 schedule combinations,
complete with prices. The traveler can then call back and
book a seat, also by hitting phone buttons.
   The service is aimed at business travelers, who often send
their secretaries scrambling to gather various flight
information. The fax also provides data about on-time
performance, flight duration and type of aircraft. Car
rentals can be handled as well.
   "It's like the ATM for travel," says David Paresky,
chairman of Thomas Cook, referring to bank teller machines.
   There are shortfalls: You must have an account with the
agency and you must have a fax machine at your disposal. The
plan also requires that users learn different number codes.
   Other agencies hope customers will want to stick with
flesh and blood agents. "I've got people who change their
minds all the time in the middle of one telephone
conversation," says Kathryn Sudeikis, executive vice
president of Brennco Travel, an agency in Overland Park, Kan.
"How's a computer going to handle that?"
   Actually, says Thomas Cook, a push-button code interrupts
the system to let you start over.
                                                                                                       

   States Can't Get a Grip
   On Air-Fare Direction
                                                                                                       

   MANY STATES would be angry about rising air fares -- if
they were sure they were rising.
   With deregulation, it's become extremely difficult to
monitor ticket prices and balance one market against another,
a fact that's led to tremendous confusion among state
watchdogs.
   Last summer, North Dakota sued NWA Inc.'s Northwest
Airlines for $50 million, alleging price gouging, after a
state-commissioned study showed fares had soared at the
state's airports. But state officials dropped the suit two
weeks ago, after a U.S. Transportation Department report
reached the opposite conclusion on prices.
   Originally, the state claimed fares from North Dakota
cities to Northwest's Minneapolis headquarters rose
"substantially" between 1986 and 1988. For example, it
charged that fares from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis surged
56%, while the national average rose only 17% and Northwest
systemwide prices inched up only 5%.
   But Transportation Department numbers showed the state's
air fares are "in line" with national numbers. Slightly red
faced, North Dakota dropped the suit in exchange for a
promise by the airline that it wouldn't gouge residents.
   The government study is "more up to date," says Nicholas
Spaeth, North Dakota's attorney general. According to Mr.
Spaeth, the federal government's report signaled that state
fares didn't change in 1989 while fares across the country
rose.
   North Dakota isn't the only one baffled. Earlier this
year, the California Commission on Aviation and Airports
became so confused by piles of testimony and research on air
fares that it couldn't issue a verdict on what has happened
to California ticket prices since deregulation. Says
Christopher Thompson, a consultant to the commission: "It's
mind-boggling."
                                                                                                       

   All's Fair in Love
   And First-Class Seats
                                                                                                       

   FREQUENT FLIERS are scheming to upgrade their seats to
first class.
   Free upgrades from coach seats are the hottest awards in
frequent-flier programs. As a result, first-class seats have
become harder to find. Many airlines won't let fliers upgrade
their seats until 24 hours before the flight. By then, many
seats already are taken. Frequently, airlines put would-be
upgraders on a standby list until the last minute, to make
sure there will be room for anyone willing to pay real money
for a first-class seat.
   To increase the odds that there will be room for them to
upgrade their tickets, some frequent fliers are booking
phantom travelers in first class. When the seats go unclaimed
at the airport, airline counter agents run through their
standby list and the schemers can step forward and get a
seat.
   To get around the 24-hour rule, some frequent fliers book
phantom travelers days in advance and then cancel the
reservation a few hours before the flight. Then they'll call
back to make their upgrade. If all goes well, they'll be told
a seat just opened up.
   "We've got to do this stuff," says an upholstery salesman
aboard a USAir flight to Chicago. "It's a dog-eat-dog world."
                                                                                                       

   Pan Am Belt-Tightening
   Shows Up at Mealtime
                                                                                                       

   AMID FINANCIAL woes, Pan Am has launched a cost-reduction
drive that's expected to save an estimated $4 million a year.
It may reduce some passenger waists as well.
   Among the cutbacks: On many short-haul flights, the ailing
carrier used to serve soup, a sandwich and dessert. By axing
the soup, Pan Am will save about $500,000 a year. On flights
between New York and Warsaw, first-class passengers will no
longer get caviar.
   Not all of the fat to trim is from food: First-class
passengers now will get just one hot towel, instead of two.

   PISCATAWAY, N.J. -- Florence Jordan sits, bewildered, as
her three children talk about how her Alzheimer's disease has
made a hell of their lives.
   Chris, the middle child and a recent college graduate,
moved back in with her 54-year-old mother in Old Bridge,
N.J., after seeing her pull a flaming dishrag from the oven,
drop it onto the living-room rug and leave it there to burn.

   "You find yourself thinking about {Alzheimer's} every
hour," says Jimmy, 22, who is still in college. "It takes
over your mind."
   Alzheimer's disease insidiously corrodes its victims'
brains. Over a period of years, it progressively destroys
their memories, their ability to reason and their hold on
reality. Before it kills them, it robs them of speech and
makes them incontinent. Some four million Americans are
afflicted; about that many people are said to suffer other
forms of dementia.
   As the illness progresses, most victims cease to grasp
fully what is happening to them. And that, mercifully,
tempers their suffering. But it doesn't temper the suffering
of the relatives and friends who feed, bathe and nurse them,
who watch over them day and night, and who mourn their slow
deaths. The families often suffer more than the victims do.
   In Piscataway, the state-financed Copsa Institute for
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders is bringing relief
both to dementia victims and to the husbands, wives and
children who care for them. For the patients, it offers a
day-hospital program that allows them to socialize, exercise,
play games and practice simple mental tasks. It has a
diagnostic clinic and, for relatives, it provides counseling,
information and a desperately needed six-hour reprieve --
several times a week -- from exhaustion and despair.
   A look at the Copsa Institute's experience shows a way of
life that may well await tens of millions of Americans.
   ---
   At 9:45 one Friday morning, about a dozen patients troop
into a room and take their places at an oblong table. (The
institute requested that only first names of most patients be
used in this story.) A majority of them meet clinical
criteria for "probable Alzheimer's disease," officials say,
while the rest suffer dementias from vascular or other
causes. A definite diagnosis of Alzheimer's, a degenerative
illness of the brain and nervous system with no known cause
or cure, is made only in a post-mortem examination of brain
tissue.
   Today, participants have spent half an hour outside in the
lobby getting reacquainted, exchanging pictures of themselves
and pinning on name tags. Decorative paper snowflakes dangle
from the ceiling.
   Staff nurse Sandy Egan opens the daily orientation period
with questions about time and place. "What day is this?" she
asks. "Friday," several voices pipe up. "Good]" Ms. Egan
writes the word "Friday" in large letters on a board. On a
calendar, she crosses out yesterday's date. "What day of the
month is today?" she asks. This time, there is a pause, and
only two or three hesitant replies.
   After questions about famous movie actors, patients'
birthdays, this and that, the group moves to a smaller room
to have their thought-processes jogged. They are shown
colorful pictures of improbable scenes -- a worker drilling a
hole in a library floor, a man walking upside down on a
ceiling, an outsize telephone plunked onto a small table.
   "What do you think of this one?" asks Lisa Berbig, the
program's coordinator.
   "It's a good picture," a man named Bill replies.
   Esther says: "I think the little girl is going to the
library, and he is doing some drilling."
   Nobody mentions the giant phone.
   The group has better luck with aphorisms. Asked to
complete the phrase, "Absence makes the . . .", several
voices cry out happily, ". . . heart grow fonder."
   Next comes a 15-minute walk, followed by group
psychotherapy. Pauline describes her favorite photo, in which
she is sitting in her grandmother's lap. Rinalda remembers
how she used to crack the whip with her own daughter and
seven -- or was it eight? -- sons. "I'd call their names in
Italian," she says, her face crinkling into a grin. "They'd
say, `C'mon, let's get outta here. Mom's mad.'"
   Lunch is chicken soup, rolls, manicotti and green beans,
with peaches for dessert. To avoid confusion, patients each
get just one utensil to eat with. Some patients sing along to
tapes of old favorite songs.
   After a rest period, health specialist Florence Meyers,
the mother of seven and the widow of an Alzheimer's victim,
leads an exercise period. Next comes dance time, and Ana, who
has seemed quite reserved, seizes two bright scarves provided
for the occasion and sashays about, swiveling her hips. Bill
asks Ms. Egan, the staff nurse, to dance.
   ---
   The Copsa Institute's day-hospital program was the first
in New Jersey when it opened in 1982, and it has been a model
and training ground for many of the 32 such facilities that
have since sprung up in the state. While day-care facilities
remain relatively rare in the U.S., people in the field
predict they will be commonplace in the next century as the
ranks of the elderly swell, to 68 million people over 65 in
the year 2040, from 30 million now.
   As this session comes to a close, the blinds are drawn to
prevent pandemonium at the sight of arriving relatives. Ms.
Berbig leads the group in imitating chickens -- pressing
hands to nose to form a beak, flapping elbows like wings and
squawking. There's more singing and dancing, then "wrap-up"
time, a review of the day's activities.
   As people pick up the patients for the night, Florence
Jordan -- the woman who lives with her 23-year-old daughter
Chris -- struggles to get into her coat. Though her left arm
is in one sleeve and Ms. Berbig is holding the other for her,
she gropes around the back of her neck, searching in vain for
the opening. After several seconds, Ms. Berbig guides her
hand.
   ---
   One of the biggest blows to Florence's son and daughters,
they say, has been the abandonment of the family by some of
their close relatives. Once, desperate for assistance, "we
went begging" to them for a few hours of their time, says
Florence's 26-year-old daughter Kathy Ciacciarelli, "but they
didn't want to get involved." She, like her brother and
sister, is active in her mother's care.
   There have been some pleasant surprises, too. Florence
Jordan's former husband, now remarried, helps out with money.
The Jordans' children are closer to one another now because
of their 54-year-old mother's situation. And while they no
longer can have sensible conversations with her, they try to
make sure she enjoys herself. She likes going to movies,
taking walks and eating Chinese food.
   As a guest is about to leave Mrs. Jordan's apartment,
Jimmy, a thick-chested former football player, walks over to
his mother and gives her a squeeze. "Hey, Ma, how you
feeling?" he asks, grinning. She beams.
   ---
   Florence Jordan's own parents are still living. After
spending a day at their apartment in a high-rise for the
elderly in Sayreville, she is eager to go home. Once she has
left, her father, 84-year-old Joe Colombo, shakes his head.
"As soon as she got here this morning, she wanted to leave,"
he says.
   Mr. Colombo used to take his daughter for walks, but he
recently had heart surgery and he has arthritis. When he and
his 86-year-old wife, Vera, discuss their daughter, one
question keeps coming up: Why? "Sometimes I ask God why he
did this," Mr. Colombo says, adding quickly that he doesn't
blame God. Vera rejects any suggestion that the disease was
inherited. Joe seems to disagree: "It could be a little gene
that snuck in," he says.
   Mrs. Colombo brightens when she remembers Florence as a
little girl. "She had eyelashes that turned way up," she
says. "She was always running."
   ---
   It is late afternoon, and Jule Sloane, a jaunty
grandmother in plaid slacks, heavy silver earrings and
wire-rimmed glasses, pours glasses of chilled white wine for
herself and a guest at her home in Summit.
   As her 72-year-old husband, John, a grandson of Thomas
Edison, mutters on a couch nearby, she speaks about the happy
years of her marriage. Mr. Sloane, a Yale graduate, went to
war after they were married in 1942. When he returned from
his service in England, Italy and North Africa, he took a job
as a writer for a house organ at Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
translating scientific jargon "into plain English," she says.
   "He was a quiet guy," she says. "He never looked rushed.
But everything always got done. He was very funny in a dry
way, always punning."
   She talks about her husband's deteriorating mental state
and the loss of his personality. His condition has been
described as "senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type," but
Mrs. Sloane believes his illness has been complicated by
strokes. He began to show signs of disorientation in the
early 1980s, forgetting what errands had brought him to town,
for example. Recently, she has had to withdraw him from a
day-care program because his behavior was becoming
disruptive; he was always trying to leave the place.
   Mrs. Sloane observes: "I don't say, `Why me?' I say, `Why
him?'" He peers at his wife, frowning, searching for words.
He is a handsome man -- tall, slim, and nattily dressed in a
plaid shirt and blue suspenders. His wife goes to him, gives
him a hug. "It's OK, honey, now you just don't be upset," she
says, and kisses his cheek.
   ---
   At a spouse-support group meeting at the Piscataway
center, a dozen men and women ranging in age from mid-50s to
late 70s sit in a circle and talk about their anguish.
   Once, they had dreamed of retirement as a reward for lives
of hard work. Now, instead of traveling and spending time
with friends, they stay at home and feed and dress their
husbands and wives. The fatigue is evident in their faces.
The ailments of old age plague them. They are angry at what
they see as government favoritism for the poor over the
middle class; they feel Alzheimer's disease, the nation's No.
4 killer (after heart disease, cancer and stroke) gets short
shrift from the media. They wonder if they will ever enjoy
life again.
   One husband gets nods of understanding when he says he has
fantasies about asphyxiating himself and his wife by "going
into the garage and turning on the key" to the ignition of
his car. A wife says she has devised "three ways" to kill
herself.
   A man named Gus says, "I'm at the end of my rope." His
wife is 60 years old but is "going back to her childhood,
when she was seven or eight," he says. "Sometimes, she gets
violent." Roger says his wife can get "kinda tough." He goes
on: "She might strike me, or throw water." Tears well up.
Though seated, he is panting, nearly out of breath. "I get a
little emotional," he says. "I myself have emphysema. So it's
extremely difficult."
   Other participants murmur their support. Here, people have
empathy.
   They also offer practical, tough-minded advice. There is a
lively discussion about the best locks to use for foiling
Alzheimer's patients' midnight wanderlust. Larry Benjamin,
who was an advertising-makeup man for the New York Times
Magazine before he retired, has been caring for his wife for
about 15 years. He continues to feed her twice a day, though
she has been in a nursing home since 1988. Mr. Benjamin, who
is 74, gently urges younger participants in the group not to
get their hopes up about the possibilities of new drugs, and
not to look askance at restraining devices for agitated
dementia victims. "Restraint isn't cruel," he says. "It's
{just} a bit of netting. You have to modify your thinking on
this."
   Several participants chastise Gus for letting his wife get
him into arguments he can't win. Gus says he keeps telling
her she will never find things she has "lost" because they
don't exist.
   "You're already in trouble," scolds Milton. "You can never
win by reasoning with an Alzheimer's patient." Several people
urge Gus to bring his wife to the Piscataway day-care center,
and they suggest ways of overcoming her resistance to the
idea. One says he tricked his wife into such a move by
telling her they were going to church. By the time they
arrived, she had forgotten the purpose of the trip.
   Everyone laughs. The horror stories have their comic side.
The laughter is easy because families see their own
experience in the stories others tell. They laugh when Ana,
who married her husband 11 years ago, in late middle age,
describes how he poured Coke into a jar of grated cheese and
started drinking it. They laugh when Gus says he has read all
the handbooks on coping with Alzheimer's patients but,
unfortunately, "the books say one thing, and my wife does
another."
   ---
   Legal-services attorney Janice Chapin tells a crowded room
of dementia victims' families how to cope with Medicaid rules
that can gobble up all of one's savings in return for a place
in a nursing home. One recommendation: Set up a big burial
account free from the state's grasp, bequeath the unused
portion to yourself or your children, and order a cheap
funeral when the time comes.
   No, she tells a gnarled old man, the eligibility
information he got from a Medicaid office was wrong. A
bureaucrat's mistake might have cost him thousands of
dollars.
   The questions at the lecture organized by the Copsa
Institute go into the nuts and bolts of nursing-home
placement and reimbursement. Standing chalk in hand next to a
blackboard, Ms. Chapin explains that the assets, but not the
earnings, of a healthy spouse can disqualify a patient from
Medicaid. But, she says, some assets, like a home in which
the healthy spouse is living, can't be touched.
   "So what am I going to do?" asks one exasperated member of
the audience. "Bury the money in the cellar?"
   Ms. Chapin replies: "Basically, you've got to spend it
all." Instead of putting it in the bank, she suggests, why
not "buy a new roof for your house?"
   ---
   William E. Reichman, the youthful, bearded medical
director of the Copsa Institute, sits at his cluttered desk
and talks about Alzheimer's. Dr. Reichman describes it as a
"familial disorder." As a researcher, he seeks more-effective
drugs to treat the disease, especially the hallucinations and
psychotic behavior relatives find even more upsetting than
the memory loss. (Sample: the impostor syndrome, in which a
spouse becomes a feared intruder.) As a psychiatrist, Dr.
Reichman tries to guide families "through a grieving process"
as Alzheimer's eats away at a loved one's very identity.
   The day center, he says, gives participants "their peer
relationships back." The elaborate structure of the
activities is crucial; long after Alzheimer's patients have
lost reasoning power, they still seem to know how to act in
familiar situations.
   Most Friday afternoons, Dr. Reichman examines dementia
victims in nursing homes where few other psychiatrists
venture. Consultations are difficult, and the state is stingy
about paying doctors.
   "As soon as I show my face in a nursing home to see Mrs.
X, the nurses start grabbing me, begging me to look at
patients Y and Z," Dr. Reichman says.
   He tries to maintain a physician's professional detachment
from the suffering he sees, but it isn't always possible.
"Some families are remarkably powerful at pulling you in," he
says. In California, where he got his early training at
UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute, the teen-age son of an
Alzheimer's patient interviewed him for a school report. Dr.
Reichman got a copy of the essay in the mail as a gift, and
he keeps it in his office. He reads excerpts:
   "My father was a very bright man. He worked on developing
the space shuttle. . . . What was once a sweet, kind, caring
personality is now almost completely gone. . . . There isn't
a moment of any day that he isn't on my mind. . . . From
writing this paper, I also learned to deal with my own
feelings. . . . I thought I was going to have a nervous
breakdown."
   ---
   In a nursing home a few miles' drive from Piscataway, Mary
lies sedated and stretched out on a special restraining
"geri-chair" in her room, a towel wrapped around a swollen
left leg. Mary, who is about 80, suffers from Alzheimer's and
from an injury to her head sustained in a car accident. She
habitually becomes agitated at about this time -- 5:30 in the
afternoon -- but today she is still asleep. A nurse's aide
bends over her, shouting, "Mary, wake up, the doctor's here."
Mary stirs. "Oh, God," she moans.
   This is Alzheimer's in its last, worst stages. Typically,
the disease strikes people in their 70s and 80s -- though the
middle-aged aren't immune -- and it results in death, often
from pneumonia or other infections, five to 20 years after
its onset.
   Dr. Reichman examines Mary. He asks her to look at him,
then loudly repeats the request. She stares vacantly. A
nurse, Merlene, smoothes Mary's hair and gives her a hug.
"How are you today, honey?" she coos.
   Leaving the room, the doctor explains that the trick is to
hit the "exact balance" of all the drugs Mary is taking.
Then, she would be able to sleep well yet stay composed in
her waking hours. But administering proper dosages is tricky:
Sloppy record-keeping, often by poorly trained or
overburdened nurses with little or no guidance from
psychiatrists, is a big problem in nursing homes.
   In a tiny alcove, Dr. Reichman pores over log books and
barks questions at nervous personnel about patients'
reactions to medications.
   ---
   There are some slivers of light in the Alzheimer's
nightmare.
   There is Florence Meyers. Nursing her husband in the late
1970s and early '80s while raising seven children was so
physically strenuous, she says, that when she finally checked
her husband into a clinic and got a few days' respite, "it
hit me like a truck. My entire body ached from all that
release." Today, as a health specialist at the Piscataway
facility, she lights up the faces of the patients with her
joshing, her hugs and an occasional tickle.
   There is Tom Johnson, Copsa's clinical coordinator, whose
uncle and aunt had Alzheimer's and who acknowledges that he
is "obsessed" about his own prospects of getting the disease.
Many of the sons and daughters of patients, he says, wonder
if they are condemned by their genes to their parents' fate.
Researchers say only about one in six patients suffer the
variety of Alzheimer's that runs in families. Mr. Johnson
feels that counseling gives people hope. "I see that life
goes on, the world doesn't cave in," he says. "In the
narcissism of being well, we say, `Oh, God, I'd kill myself.'
But in the thick of the disease, people cope. They suffer --
but they cope." What strikes him is the stubborn love
families show victims even in the final stages of Alzheimer's
disease.
   There is Carmine Cascella, a retired factory
production-department superintendent who does volunteer work
at the institute two afternoons a week for the satisfaction
of thinking "maybe I've made {patients} a little happier." He
says that "after a while, they sort of recognize you. You
dance with them. You sing with them." Before he came to Copsa
2 1/2 years ago, he had no idea what Alzheimer's was. Giving
a helping hand, he says, "is like I'm giving something back"
to society.
   There is Mildred Potenza, who organized a grass-roots
organization in the late 1970s to lobby the state to set up
the Copsa program. Her duties as the institute's
resource-center coordinator include fielding questions from
all over New Jersey on an 800 line. She often talks to
worried relatives "for half an hour or more. Even if I can't
offer anything concrete, they feel much better."
   Finally, there are all the exhausted husbands, wives and
children whose love shines through. The wife of a former
schoolteacher, married to him for nearly 60 years, and
herself once a professional musician, struggles to remember
how many children she has. Finally, she stammers, "Three, no
two boys . . . and a girl." He gently corrects her: "No,
honey, it's two girls and a boy. You're doing just fine."

   Insiders Sell Out

   NEW YORK -- Talk about a close call.
   That's what it was for some corporate insiders, according
to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These
officers and directors sold stock in their companies just
weeks before prices fell sharply.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the SEC filings:
   -- David F. Brown, former chairman of General Development
Corp., sold his entire stake in the Miami real estate company
in the two weeks before it filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection April 6. Mr. Brown, who resigned
under pressure from the company's board March 14, sold 39,059
shares at an average price of $4.40 a share. The stock
finished yesterday at $1.375 a share, up 12.5 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   -- Seven insiders at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. sold
80,765 shares of the mutual fund between March 6 and March
13. Since then, the price of the Baltimore company's stock
has fallen about 16%, chiefly on the company's March 30
announcement that some of its mutual funds held commercial
paper issued by Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust, a real-estate
investment trust that filed for bankruptcy protection. In
national over-the-counter trading yesterday, T. Rowe Price
shares closed at $24.25, down 25 cents; the insiders sold at
an average share price of $28.71.
   -- Eight insiders at Network Equipment Technologies Inc.
sold over 164,539 shares in late January and February. They
got $28 to $31 a share; the stock's price has since fallen
sharply, closing yesterday at $10.625 a share, up 87.5 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Mr. Brown sold all of his General Development Corp. shares
from March 23 through March 30, shortly after he pleaded
guilty March 22 in federal court in Miami to one count of
conspiracy. On the same day, the company also pleaded guilty
in a plea bargain with federal prosecutors to settle charges
it defrauded home buyers by charging inflated prices based on
improper appraisals.
   General Development agreed to pay a $500,000 fine, and
under a pending restitution agreement, would pay the home
buyers about $80 million to $100 million over 25 years.
   Mr. Brown and his attorney declined to comment on the
sales. Otis Wragg, spokesman for General Development,
declined to comment other than to say that Mr. Brown didn't
have to sell his stock as part of an agreement tied to his
departure from the company.
   Although Mr. Brown's shares, at an average price of $4.40
a share, sold for far more than he would have earned if he
had waited to sell them until after the bankruptcy filing,
the former chairman probably lost money on the transaction.
Some of the shares were acquired through a retirement plan,
or through the exercise of warrants provided by the company,
but SEC files show Mr. Brown bought slightly less than half
of the shares in the open market in purchases from 1986
through 1988, paying $13.38 to $22.65 a share.
   The stock of T. Rowe Price has also skidded lower since
its insider sales, chiefly on the company's exposure to the
problems of Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust. On April 16, T. Rowe
disclosed it holds about $65 million of the REIT's commercial
paper and notes, and later announced it would take a $4
million charge against second-quarter earnings as a result.
   Stephen Norwitz, spokesman for the company, said the
strong pace of insider selling in March was "coincidental,"
adding that Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. didn't downgrade Mortgage
&amp; Realty's commercial paper until March 13 -- after most of
the insiders had sold -- and that the REIT didn't file for
bankruptcy protection until later in the month.
   The largest sale was by William D. Gould Jr., a vice
president, who sold 30,000 shares March 6 and March 8. The
sale represented 36% of his holding in the company, SEC
filings show. Stephen Boesel, portfolio manager of the firm's
Growth &amp; Income Mutual Fund, sold 21,000 shares, the first
time he has sold shares since September 1986. SEC filings
show Mr. Boesel retains 21,100 shares, but the company said
he holds an additional 100,000 shares that have been omitted
in filings to the SEC.
   The other T. Rowe insiders sold between 1,260 and 15,000
shares, representing 5% to 57% of their holdings, according
to the company.
   Mr. Boesel and Mr. Gould declined to comment. Mr. Norwitz
said Mr. Boesel sold his shares to purchase a house, while
Mr. Gould sold to meet a personal obligation.
   At Network Equipment Technologies Inc., Chairman Bruce
Smith was one of the biggest sellers, trimming his holdings
50,000 shares Jan. 24 through Feb. 15, according to SEC
filings. They show that he retains 179,781 shares. Steve
Schlumberger, formerly a company vice president and now on
sabbatical, also sold 50,000 shares in February, retaining
75,358 shares, SEC filings show.
   The other six NET insiders sold between 393 and 23,000
shares, representing less than 1% to 50% of their holdings in
the company, according to SEC filngs.
   The company declined to comment on the sales or to confirm
the SEC figures.
   On April 2, the company announced that its fiscal
fourth-quarter results would fall well below expectations. It
reported those results April 25. For the quarter ended March
31, it had earnings of four cents a share, down 87% from a
year earlier, on an 18% revenue rise.

   Tutto Toscanini on Disc

   Arturo Toscanini, who dominated the international musical
scene for more than three decades, developed from a
revolutionary conductor to commercial icon to posthumous
totem. Now a new generation will have the opportunity to
assess his position for itself as BMG Classics (which owns
RCA) launches "The Toscanini Collection," an ambitious
re-release of all the conductor's approved recordings for
RCA-Victor.
   Scheduled for completion by January 1992 (to coincide with
the 125th anniversary of the conductor's birth), the
digitally remastered series of 82 compact discs (or 81
audiocassettes) will include Toscanini's first records with
the orchestra of La Scala in 1920, his recordings with the
New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra, and his
performances with the NBC Symphony, created for him in 1937
by RCA's founder and director, David Sarnoff.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   During 1990, BMG also is releasing "Toscanini: The
Television Concerts (1948-52)," nine VHS videocassettes or
laser videodiscs containing live NBC performances never
commercially available before in the U.S. The first two,
released this month, are a concert version of Verdi's "Aida"
(with Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker) and Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony.
   Now, I freely admit to my penchant for heroes, and of
20th-century musicians, few were so generously endowed with
heroic qualities as Arturo Toscanini. Styled "The World's
Greatest Conductor" by the Sarnoff publicity machine, he
looked the part, with his flowing white hair, pointed
mustache and penetrating eyes. Indeed, not until the
ascendancy of Herbert von Karajan was there quite so
charismatic a podium figure as this son of a Parmesan tailor.
   Born in 1867, Toscanini played cello at the premiere of
Verdi's "Otello" in 1887, and conducted the premieres of
Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Puccini's "Boheme" before he
was 30. By middle age, having weathered successive stormy
tenures at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera, Toscanini was
regarded as the supreme interpreter of Verdi and of Wagner:
He was the first non-German to conduct at Bayreuth, and a
recent EMI CD of his 1934-35 performances of excerpts from
"Parsifal" and "Gotterdammerung" with the BBC Symphony show
why. He also was considered the best symphonic man around.
   His active repertoire included roughly 600 works by 200
composers, all of which he conducted -- and rehearsed -- from
memory. Renowned for his almost hypnotic power over
orchestras, he could reduce hardened players to jelly with an
angry glance, and his rehearsal tirades were Vesuvian -- one
NBC Symphony musician eventually collected 200 of Toscanini's
broken batons.
   Called "The Maestro" or "The Old Man" by those who revered
him, and a lot more colorful things by those who didn't,
Toscanini literally came to represent classical music to a
generation of Americans who religiously tuned into his weekly
NBC Symphony broadcast from NBC Studio 8H in New York.
   In any event, his controversial legacy is well documented,
and the first batch in the "mid- priced" BMG series certainly
is solid: three boxed sets including the Beethoven symphonies
(five CDs), Brahms symphonies and selected works (four CDs),
and a triple package including Verdi's "Aida," "Falstaff" and
Requiem. BMG rates high marks for the handsome physical
product, embellished with portraits from Robert Hupka's
famous candid photo series, and featuring learned
commentaries and reminiscences.
   The meticulous digital remastering, under the direction of
RCA Executive Producer John Pfeiffer, who produced some of
the actual sessions themselves, extracts as much as possible
from the original grooves. We hear details (musical and
otherwise) that were never so apparent on the 78s or on the
later LP transcriptions. Nonetheless, the sound itself can
never be more than adequate: The 1940s, when many of these
performances were recorded, was far from a sonic golden age
for RCA-Victor, and Toscanini's NBC Symphony recordings are
marked by a particular grainy quality in the strings and a
generally unreverberant ambiance due primarily to the
notorious dryness of Studio 8H.
   According to Mr. Pfeiffer, Toscanini himself preferred
this "clean articulate ambiance because it allowed him to
hear everything without the distortion of reverberation."
Even when he recorded in the warmer Carnegie Hall, he asked
that the miking reproduce the dry character of 8H.
   But what of the performances themselves? Toscanini's
primary goal as an interpreter was objectivity -- the purest
possible expression of the composer's ideas with as little
intrusion of Toscanini's own ego as he could manage. This
often has been misinterpreted as slavish adherence to the
printed page, which it was not. However, his success is
strictly up to the listener. Hence, while many swear by
Toscanini's versions, others swear at them.
   At the high end of the current crop are his Verdi
performances: The 1950 "Falstaff" is a touchstone of
vivacious ensemble work with a nearly perfect cast led by
baritone Giuseppe Valdegno. The 1949 "Aida" (the same one
that's on the video) and the Requiem are almost as fine.
Toscanini's Brahms contains some remarkable readings -- for
example, the eloquent poco allegretto movement of the Third
Symphony. But on the whole, the sound and the swift tempos
often strip these scores of their satisfying warmth. Nor is
Toscanini's Beethoven cycle one's desert-island choice. His
Ninth is superb, with a princely Jan Peerce singing the
fiendish Turkish variation in the "Ode to Joy," but the First
and Fifth are so driven that one feels one's teeth loose by
the end, and his slow movement of the Seventh is, to these
ears, emotionally pallid next to the reading of more
"subjective" conductors such as Furtwangler and the late
Eugen Jochum. Yet Toscanini represents a pioneering modernist
approach to performance, a swing away (sometimes too far
away) from the over-indulgent exaggerations of his romantic
predecessors in search of what he perceived to be musical
honesty.
   Much of his work may not stand as definitive nowadays (his
magnificent Rossini overtures, for example, wouldn't pass
muster in light of modern scholarship). Nonetheless, it is
the work of a highly cultivated musician, a brilliant
technician, and a lively spirit. You may love it or hate it.
But you cannot dismiss it.

   Considering Sale
   Of Certain Assets

   ATLANTA -- Georgia-Pacific Corp. said it is considering
the sale of some assets to pay down debt from its recent
$3.74 billion acquisition of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   While the forest-products concern declined to estimate the
value of the assets under study, one industry analyst said
three mills alone that might be sold could bring $1.1 billion
to $1.2 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific said the decision to sell some assets
resulted from a study of the huge portfolio of holdings
resulting from the merger with Nekoosa. The study, not
surprisingly, turned up some operational overlap,
particularly among containerboard assets, said T. Marshall
Hahn, Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive officer.
   "This is a strategic decision, not one of necessity," Mr.
Hahn said. "In addition, we wanted to squelch any rumors
before they got started of certain mills and plants being
sold."
   Indeed, Georgia-Pacific had sought to play down the need
to sell assets throughout its four-month battle to acquire
Nekoosa. "The view always was that they would sell two or
three mills to work down the initial debt," said Gary
Palmero, an Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst who made the $1.1
billion to $1.2 billion estimate. "The company is in a
position where it's not necessary, but it's certainly
desirable."
   Georgia-Pacific said assets targeted for possible sale
include mills in Georgia, Oregon and Wisconsin that make
linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper -- used to
make containerboard for boxes; several thousand acres of
accompanying timberland, and 17 box plants around the
country.
   Mr. Hahn, while declining to estimate how much the assets
might fetch, said any proceeds would be used to reduce
Georgia-Pacific's debt load.
   Oppenheimer's Mr. Palmero said the three mills "are all
well-run mills that will be in demand. The fact that
Georgia-Pacific isn't desperate only adds to the value."
   Mr. Hahn said Georgia-Pacific "will move without delay"
now that it has completed its study. "We've had a good many
inquiries about these and other assets," he said. "That
obviously puts us in a position to move ahead."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Georgia-Pacific closed at $41.625, up 62.5 cents.
   Separately, Ronald P. Hogan and James C. Van Meter were
elected Georgia-Pacific directors, bringing total membership
to 16. Mr. Hogan, 49 years old, is president and chief
operating officer. Mr. Van Meter, 52 years old, is executive
vice president, finance, and chief financial officer.

   Doctor Study Finds
   High Error Rate
   In Prescriptions

   Doctors at a big teaching hospital made mistakes in three
of every 1,000 drug prescriptions they wrote. Half the
mistakes could have caused problems, including fatal
reactions, for patients, a team of hospital pharmacists said.
   The pharmacists, from the Albany (N.Y.) Medical Center
Hospital, said they routinely double-check doctors'
prescriptions against patients' computerized medical records.
They caught mistakes in 905 of more than 289,000
prescriptions written by the hospital's staff and attending
physicians in 1987, Timothy S. Lesar and his pharmacy
colleagues reported in this week's issue of the Journal of
the American Medical Association.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The errors in 522 of the prescriptions could have caused
problems for patients, ranging from life-threatening
reactions to bothersome side effects, had the prescribed
drugs been used as directed, the pharmacists said.
   In the most common serious mistake -- 61 cases -- doctors
prescribed a drug to which the patient was allergic. Other
errors included ordering antibiotics for serious infections
for the wrong patient, ordering overdoses of drugs including
"blood thinners" to prevent blood clots, underdoses of a drug
to combat lead poisoning, and mixing up names of drugs --
such as prescribing azathioprine (an immune suppressant that
prevents rejection of transplanted organs) instead of
azidothymidine, or AZT, used to bolster the immune system of
AIDS patients. (AZT's generic name is now zidovudine.)
   Most of the prescriptions were written by doctors on the
hospital staff, with first-year residents having the highest
error rate -- four erroneous prescriptions per 1,000 written.
Doctors in private practice wrote only a small portion of the
prescriptions but had the second highest error rate, almost
3.5 per 1,000 prescriptions.

   Raising Penalties
   Levied by OSHA

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration endorsed legislation
that would substantially stiffen some penalties for
employers' workplace-safety violations.
   Testifying before the Senate labor subcommittee, Gerard
Scannell, assistant secretary of labor, said the Labor
Department supports provisions of pending bills that would
triple potential civil penalties for safety and health
violations and upgrade from misdemeanors to felonies any
willful violations that cause death.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tripling civil penalties, as provided in a bill offered by
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), could sharply escalate
fines imposed by the department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, which Mr. Scannell heads. It would
allow fines of $30,000 for each violation; currently, the
limit is $10,000 per violation, which, in recent years, has
itself resulted in multimillion-dollar OSHA citations against
some large employers.
   Last month, for instance, the agency proposed fines of
$5.7 million against Phillips Petroleum Co., stemming from
explosions in October at a Houston-area plastics plant, which
killed 23 workers. Earlier, OSHA proposed a record $7.3
million in fines against USX Corp., citing numerous health
and safety violations at two plants.
   While the citations usually are sharply scaled down in
settlements, Mr. Scannell said that since 1986, the agency
has issued about 100 citations for "egregious" violations to
about 90 employers. He said about two-thirds of those
citations have already been settled, "securing swift
abatement of hazards," and resulted in about $15 million in
fines.
   Mr. Scannell also backed changing to felonies from
misdemeanors those willful violations that lead to death in
order to encourage U.S. attorneys to prosecute such OSHA
cases.
   Mr. Scannell's testimony also contained the Labor
Department's first formal declaration that OSHA enforcement
doesn't preempt state and local prosecution of employer
misconduct involving workplace health or safety violations.
States shouldn't be pre-empted from enforcing criminal laws
that deal with murder, manslaughter or assault, he said. But
he said that purely regulatory laws, which make it a crime
for employers to violate particular health or safety
standards, should be pre-empted unless they're part of an
OSHA-approved state regulatory plan.
   Although OSHA has been working with state and local
prosecutors who pursue criminal workplace health or safety
cases against employers, the department previously hadn't
taken a stand on the preemption issue. The Justice
Department, however, has stated that OSHA doesn't pre-empt
such prosecutions.

   I am glad to see Frederick C. Klein take the schools to
task for the gross mistreatment of their athletes (Leisure &amp;
Arts, March 23). The schools, pro teams and networks all make
big bucks and the players are signed to pristine
non-compensatory contracts, we are led to believe.
   The young basketball player who died on the court recently
had a $1 million disability insurance policy (not life) for
which he had paid $6,600 out of pocket. I don't know many
collegians who can afford that kind of money for anything,
much less insurance. And now Notre Dame announces a $6
million adder in TV revenues over the next few years by
virtue of a new contract with NBC. That comes to more than
$10,000 per year per man on the roster, whether
fourth-stringer or scholarship hero. It doesn't seem right.

   SEOUL, South Korea -- The government's heavy-handed
crackdown on two major labor strikes in recent days produced
May Day sympathy strikes across the country Tuesday, ending a
relatively peaceful period in South Korean labor relations.
   But government moves to spur South Korea's ailing economy,
including the crackdown by riot police on strikers at Hyundai
Heavy Industries' Ulsan shipyard and at Korea Broadcasting
Service headquarters in Seoul, helped produce a sharp
reversal in the Seoul stock market's recent free fall. The
composite index gained 29.79 points in heavy trading Tuesday
to close at 718.45, a sharp recovery from the drop of 31.71
points, or 4.4%, on Monday, when the index hit an 18-month
low. Tuesday's rally still left the index 21% below its level
at the end of 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The labor disturbances haven't been about wages or working
conditions. Unionists are battling the government over what
they consider to be the suppression of democratic labor
rights. But the government, saying that the strikes
threatened the economy, sent riot police into Hyundai's Ulsan
shipyard at dawn Saturday to end a three-day wildcat strike
by 20,000 workers angered by the government's arrest of union
leaders. The police raid scattered the workers, though a
small group took refuge atop a giant shipyard crane, and
others have continued to fight police in Ulsan streets.
Hyundai Heavy Industries is a unit of Hyundai Corp.
   Then at midnight Monday, riot police stormed the Seoul
headquarters of Korea Broadcasting System, the
government-owned television network, where workers had been
on strike for 19 days to protest the appointment of a crony
of former dictator Chun Doo Hwan to head the organization.
Several hundred journalists and technicians were detained.
   Peaceful sympathy strikes are under way at Hyundai Motor
Co. and other Hyundai group companies in Ulsan. Munhwa
Broadcasting Corp., a second government-owned network, is
also on strike to show support for KBS workers. Several other
companies reported work slowdowns or strikes and subway
workers at several stations in Seoul reportedly were allowing
customers to ride free as a way of protesting the government
crackdown.
   Until the government acted at Hyundai and KBS, Korea was
enjoying a rare respite from labor strife. In recent months
wage settlements have averaged less than 10%, about half the
rate of the past three years, and there have been only a
fourth as many work stoppages.
   Labor experts expect the disturbances to continue for a
few weeks. Park Young Bum of the Korea Labor Institute says
the government repression challenges the unions to fight back
to show they can't be intimidated. "To a large extent, the
government provoked it," he said. "If they win Hyundai, they
win everything."
   Unlike in previous years, public support seems solidly on
the government's side. It has convinced Koreans that the
country is in an economic crisis and that worker disruptions
will doom any recovery.
   To add to Korea's disruptions, angry investors in recent
days have been invading the offices of brokerage firms and
smashing windows and furniture to vent their anger at the
plunging stock market. Many brokerage offices are shuttered
during the day and riot police are standing guard outside a
few downtown Seoul offices to fend off mobs. Threatening
phone calls have been made to brokers, government officials
and newspapers. The Wall Street Journal bureau in Seoul
received several death threats Monday after a Korean language
newspaper reported the Journal had quoted analysts as saying
they thought the market would fall further.
   To shore up investor confidence, the government yesterday
announced that in addition to the anti-strike measures it
would renew crackdowns on real-estate speculation and
consumer-price gouging. The Economic Planning Board ordered
conglomerates to sell the undeveloped real estate they are
holding for speculation, in the hope that proceeds from the
property sales will be channeled into stocks and that
inflation, fanned by real-estate speculation, will cool.
   The planning board said government efforts to fight
real-estate speculation and other economic problems wouldn't
succeed if growing labor disputes weren't checked. Some
businesses have shunned investment in the face of what they
see as excessive demands for wages and other concessions.
   Although the government's moves obviously heartened stock
investors, some brokers and market analysts were doubtful
that the market's rise would continue. "It's just a temporary
boost," said an analyst for Ssangyang Investment &amp; Securities
Co., one of the nation's biggest brokerage houses. "It's not
likely to continue because the economic fundamentals haven't
changed."
   Meanwhile, a previous plan for Korean securities houses to
create a pool of cash to buy stocks and prop up the market
appears to be doomed. Securities houses are pressed for cash
and have been calling in margin accounts to raise money. But
to settle accounts, customers have had to sell stocks, making
the market fall further.

   THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT'S choice to head state-run

government says Mr. Soh wasn't a close associate of Mr. Chun,
the post was ceremonial and Mr. Soh had little influence. Mr.
Soh later worked with Seoul Shinmun newspaper.

   A prediction of increased joblessness after three and a
half years of declining unemployment is more bad news for
Margaret Thatcher's government. The Confederation of British
Industry's latest quarterly survey forecasts that
manufacturing-sector employment will drop despite
expectations of a "slight increase in output in the next four
months."
   The CBI said 34% of the 1,232 manufacturers surveyed
expect to lay off workers in the next four months. The survey
also showed that "business confidence has declined further in
response to the squeeze in home demand and lower capacity
utilization. Investment intentions remain weak in the face of
continued high interest rates."
   David Wigglesworth, chairman of the CBI's
economic-situation committee, said profits "are being
squeezed by severe competition and the high cost of finance
and labor." Poor domestic demand "makes it very difficult for
manufacturers to match the productivity growth achieved by
major overseas rivals."
                                                                                                       

   HONG KONG TOURISM IMPROVES
                                                                                                       

   Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong in February climbed 11% from
a year ago, showing signs of recovery from the shock of last
June's bloodshed in Beijing. The number of visitors rose to
832,047 in the year's first two months from 809,313 a year
earlier, a 3% increase. Last year, tourist arrivals in the
British colony fell for the first time in 18 years, dropping
4% to 5.36 million from 5.59 million in 1988, which saw an
increase of 24% over 1987.
                                                                                                       

   IRELAND CRACKS DOWN ON SMOKING
                                                                                                       

   Ireland launched a crackdown on smokers, with offenders to
be fined $150 if they break new anti-smoking laws. Smoking
has been banned in theaters, libraries, schools and airports
and on trains and buses; restaurants have been ordered to set
up no-smoking areas. The proportion of Irish smokers has
slumped from 45% of the population 15 years ago to 27% today,
but health authorities are concerned the decline has slowed.
                                                                                                       

   BOON FOR A MALAYSIAN COMPANY
                                                                                                       

   Malaysia's dominant political party, the United Malays
National Organization, has designated Renong Bhd. to assume
control of most of the party's vast corporate assets. The
arrangement would catapult the modest-sized property company
into one of the biggest investment-holding concerns in the
region. Analysts said the move would simplify UMNO's complex
business links and also could partly be aimed at
strengthening the party's financial base ahead of a general
election that must be held by October 1991.
                                                                                                       

   PRESERVING DENMARK'S PAST
                                                                                                       

   Danish archaeologists are working at full speed to
excavate a 1,000-year-old Viking graveyard before a motorway
obliterates the site. The recently discovered site on Zealand
island contains up to 70 graves from the 10th century, some
with well-preserved skeletons, bronze jewelry and household
objects. Officials at the Soroe Museum said it was too late
to stop work on the motorway linking Copenhagen with the port
of Korsoer. "We have only until May 4, when motorway workers
are due to move in, but with 11 men working flat out I think
we'll be able to excavate the whole site," archaeologist
Helge Nielsen said.
                                                                                                       

   TOYOTA'S EAST EUROPE PLANS
                                                                                                       

   Toyota Motor Corp. is studying plans to establish a
marketing and repair-shop network in Eastern Europe, a
company spokesman said. Although the Japanese auto maker
hasn't yet announced any firm decisions, the spokesman said
that, in light of the recent political developments in
Eastern Europe, there is potential for such expansion in the
region. He said Toyota is looking into opening marketing and
service shops in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
                                                                                                       

   LENDING TO CHINA
                                                                                                       

   The Asian Development Bank is unlikely to resume project
lending to China soon because the bank's biggest donors, the
U.S. and Japan, still oppose such credits.
   Soon after Chinese troops killed demonstrators in Beijing
last June, the ADB suspended lending to China for commercial
projects. China's delegates to the annual meeting of the
bank, which begins today in New Delhi, had hoped that the
ADB's board of governors might reconsider its decision this
week.
   U.S. officials say they are opposed to a resumption in
lending to China because the nation's economy remains
volatile. "Our position has been that we're for basic human
needs, but beyond that, we're not for it unless there's a
dedication to economic reform," said Victor Frank Jr.,
director of the U.S. delegation.
   The Japanese delegates said that economic considerations,
not politics, are behind their decision to support the U.S.
opposition to new loans.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese town of Asaji, high in the mountains of the
southern island of Kyushu, has budgeted $12,000 this year to
buy land to give away to new residents. In return, the town
requires them to build a house and stay there for 20 years.
Asaji's population has declined by half since 1955, to less
than 4,100. . . . As part of a charity event, 26 chefs in
Strasbourg, France, whipped up an 80,000-egg omelet filled
with 1,763 pounds of mushrooms, then dished out portions with
bread and drinks to 22,000 people.

   SOVIETS JEERED the Kremlin leadership, disrupting May Day
celebrations.
   Tens of thousands of people in Moscow's Red Square
whistled and mocked Gorbachev and members of the Politburo
and Presidential Council, turning the traditionally
stagemanaged workers' parade into an unprecedented protest
against Communist rule. The officials left their posts atop
Lenin's Mausoleum, but the demonstration continued for an
hour before it was dispersed by KGB security police. The
crowd's action was considered the most vivid display to date
of public anger at the Kremlin's leadership, underscoring a
growing mood of rebellion in the Soviet Union.

   Former hostage Reed underwent preliminary medical

American hostages are still being held.
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. said it was making "small gestures" of
appreciation to Iran and Syria over Reed's freedom, and there

   New York Leaders
   Agree to Broaden
   State's Sales Tax

   NEW YORK -- Government leaders tentatively agreed on a
broad expansion of the New York sales tax as a way to deal
with the state's budget deficit.
   The agreement, reached among legislative leaders and Gov.
Mario Cuomo in Albany, would extend the state sales tax for
the first time to services such as custom computer
programming, management consulting and public relations. The
sales tax package would generate about $380 million a year,
said a spokesman for Ralph Marino, New York state Senate
majority leader.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tax plan received an angry reaction from New York's
service business community. Burson-Marsteller, a public
relations firm, said the tax plan "can result only in lower
employment for public relations practitioners in New York
state and lower profits for businesses like ours."
   The New York chapter of the Public Relations Society of
America said the industry and its suppliers "generate more
than $554 million in business in the state. In our
information-intensive society, a tax on such services will
result in public relations businesses being at a competitive
disadvantage since the vast majority of states do not levy
such a tax."
   The proposed service tax is "really a disservice tax,
because it will drive service businesses from New York to
surrounding states," said Michael Henning, managing partner
of the New York office of Ernst &amp; Young, an accounting and
consulting firm. "It's ill-conceived, hastily drafted and
extremely dangerous."
   Service taxes aren't the only means to boost revenues
being considered by New York legislators as they try to close
a budget gap of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. The state has
been operating without a budget since the fiscal year began
April 1. Government leaders have also tentatively agreed to
impose a temporary surcharge on corporate net incomes that
could generate an additional $340 million to $510 million a
year in revenues.
   But with states facing decreased revenues and the economy
becoming increasingly service oriented, there is growing
pressure to tax areas that previously haven't been taxed.
   Service companies have been fighting back. In Florida,
opposition to a tax on advertising in 1987 was so strong that
the bill was repealed after just a few months. More recently,
a number of other states have tried to impose advertising
taxes, usually without success.
   Under the agreement reached in Albany, New York's sales
tax would be extended to magazine sales and telephone calls
to 900-numbers. New York state currently imposes a 4% sales
tax on most consumer goods; in addition, counties levy an
extra 3% to 4.25% sales tax.
   James Gifford, executive vice president of the New York
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that levying taxes on
services is subject to confusion. "One of our concerns is
that economic consulting is a very imprecise term and you
could sweep in a whole range of activities that are part and
parcel of the investment banking community," he said. But Mr.
Gifford said the group doesn't object to the proposed state
surcharge on corporate profits because it is a "broad-based
and temporary tax."

   Tokyo stock prices firmed in last-hour buying by
investment trust funds and other participants, after moving
narrowly in lackluster trading most of the day.
   In London, share prices finished mostly higher, carried
along on a technical recovery that began at the start of the
week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 105.03 points
at 29689.83. The index gained 160.22 points Friday. The
market is open only yesterday and today this week because of
national holidays.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose 362.69 points to
close the morning session at 30052.52.
   Tuesday's trading was razor-thin. Lack of attractively
priced shares encouraged individuals and some fund managers
to extend their holidays, traders said. Investors who were
present also stayed on the sidelines, leaving their positions
untouched out of caution they could be overtaken by movements
on overseas financial markets later in the week, traders
added.
   A low 240 million shares were estimated to have changed
hands on the first section, down from 488 million shares
Friday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 467 to 427,
while 205 issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which gained 5.86 points Friday, was up 8.82
points, or 0.40%, at 2214.78.
   The second section index gained 16.19 points, or 0.46%, to
close at 3547.14. The index advanced 15.23 points Friday.
Volume was estimated at seven million shares, down from nine
million shares Friday.
   Traders said the market mood remained stable despite
growing expectations about higher interest rates in the U.S.
and West Germany.
   Although the market will be closed later this week, many
participants will be closely watching the results of the
Bundesbank's regular meeting tomorrow. Friday's announcement
of U.S. employment data is also a focus of attention amid
concerns about growing inflationary pressure in the U.S.,
which could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to maintain
higher interest rates, traders said.
   But relatively stable foreign exchange and bond markets in
Tokyo helped many participants hold on to a perception that
the yen's sharp and continuous slide is unlikely, said
Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at Okasan
Securities.
   "If the U.S. or West Germany raises its interest rate, the
yen will be sold against the dollar and mark, but to a
limited level," the official added.
   Because of expectations that high-technology shares may be
established as a focus of trade in May starting next week,
investors, including investment trust funds and some
institutions, picked up these stocks, traders said.
   The prospect of a weaker yen encouraged buying of such
export-oriented sectors, but investors aren't fully confident
on committing themselves to any sectors at the moment, said
Atsushi Koishihara, general manager of the equity division at
Taiheiyo Securities.
   A broad range of electronics shares finished higher
yesterday. Winners included Sony, which rose 180 yen to 8650
yen ($1.13 to $54.45), and TDK, which was up 180 yen at 7060
yen. Both were supported by buying by one of the Big Four
Japanese brokerage houses, traders said.
   Sharp added 10 yen to 1720 yen, while Hitachi closed at
1600 yen, up 20 yen.
   Plant engineering companies were popular for their strong
earnings outlooks, reflecting increasing plant exports,
traders said. Chiyoda Corp. gained 50 yen to 2330 yen, while
Toyo Engineering Corp. advanced 40 yen to 1980 yen.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share
index finished up 14.5 points at 2117.9, about midway between
the intraday high of 2126 reached at around midafternoon and
the low of 2111.4 posted just after the start of official
trading.
   At the close, the Financial Times 30 share index was up
9.9 points at 1663.5. Volume was 370.8 million shares, mildly
better than 326.3 million a day earlier.
   Among individual stocks, pharmaceutical Glaxo gained 16
pence to 762 pence (26 cents to $12.51) in sympathy with
Britain's largest chemicals concern, Imperial Chemical
Industries, which released a bullish set of first-quarter
earnings Monday. ICI added six pence to #10.86.
   Enterprise Oil leaped 15 pence to 570 pence, while Lasmo
fell 12 pence to 361 pence after a 1-for-2 stock split.
Several traders suggested investors might have switched from
Lasmo to Enterprise.
   Large gainers included retail group Great Universal
Stores, which rose 15 pence to 909 pence, and STC, which
climbed nine pence to 243 pence after a positive tone to the
annual shareholders meeting convened during the session.
   Meanwhile, Amsterdam prices closed lower. Other European
and South African markets were closed for May Day.
   Stocks closed higher in Sydney, Wellington and Seoul;
lower in Taipei; and mixed in Hong Kong. The markets in
Singapore and Manila were closed for holidays.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   Mysterious Death of a New York Artist

<LP>
   On Sept. 8, 1985, the aspiring artist Ana Mendieta
plummeted to her death from the 34th-floor Greenwich Village
apartment she shared with the moderately famous minimalist
sculptor Carl Andre. Andre subsequently told police that his
mildly inebriated wife, a Cuban-American, was depressed about
not being as moderately famous as he, and leapt. The police
did not bite. Circumstantial evidence was sufficiently strong
to indict Andre for second-degree murder, but not
sufficiently strong to put him in the slammer, where people
who have spent their adult lives arranging hundreds of bricks
or bales of hay in fascinating patterns on museum floors do
not win friends as easily as in lower Manhattan.
   To this day, no one knows what happened up on the 34th
floor in the moments before Mendieta's death, but this has
not prevented Robert Katz from writing a 456-page book about
it. In fairness to Mr. Katz, "Naked by the Window" (Atlantic
Monthly Press, $19.95) must have been a tough assignment.
With Mendieta dead and Andre unwilling to be interviewed, Mr.
Katz had to reconstruct the story by talking to 200 friends
or relatives of the artists. He didn't get much out of them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By the end of the book, Mr. Katz cannot conceal his
chagrin at the art world's circle-the-wagons mentality, at
the reluctance of New York's artistic community to bare its
soul to an outsider. Since a typical Katz sentence reads, "He
believed in the culture of art as a cathedral in which one
might find communion with the essence of one's times," the
artists probably were smart to clam up.
   The author has arranged the story in such a way that the
reader starts off assuming that Andre is guilty of his wife's
murder -- because of the artist's oddly phrased 9-1-1 call
reporting his wife's fall, because of a suspicious scratch on
his nose, because Mendieta was afraid of heights, and
because, at 4 foot 10 inches tall, the rising 36-year-old
artist was too short to have accidentally fallen out of the
window, not with 73% of her body below the sill.
   But despite Mr. Katz's potboiling efforts to make the
verdict seem in doubt, it becomes apparent that Andre could
never be convicted on evidence as inconclusive as this,
particularly not when there were so many people willing to
attest to his worth as an artist and as a human being, and to
lend him big bucks to hire a hotshot lawyer (there was no way
the court was going to accept 183 bales of hay as bond
collateral, no matter how ingeniously they were arranged).
   This is not Mr. Katz's only problem. Although Andre is an
artist very familiar to a knowing but tiny elite, he is not
Andy Warhol (or even Jasper Johns). That's largely why the
scandal, after an initial flurry, attracted so little
interest. Andre was a star, but not of the first magnitude,
and Mendieta was not a star at all.
   To make matters worse, the trial was completely
overshadowed by two other New York scandals: Robert
Chambers's strangling of fellow preppy Jennifer Levin in
Central Park, and art dealer Andrew Crispo's alleged crossing
of the line from Saturday-night sadomasochism to the
fullblown torture of one man and the death of another.
   Mr. Katz intermittently throws out the suggestion that
Mendieta's Hispanic origins may have had something to do with
this lack of press interest, but in truth the exiled daughter
of anti-Castro Cubans, the girl who had grown up in an Iowa
orphanage, never truly belonged to the Hispanic community
north of 96th Street; she was a denizen of the artsy-craftsy
barrio south of 14th. The ethnic angle does not ring true.
   The feminist angle does -- or should. Had Mendieta not
been a short, obscure female artist, Mr. Katz seems to argue,
and had Andre not been an established male fixture on the art
scene, more of a stink might have been raised by his
acquittal. But even here Mr. Katz ran into problems, for, to
his amazement, plenty of women were ready to go to bat for
Andre, and the feminist community never really got its dander
up.
   The book purports to be a voyage inside the SoHo artburb,
but it falls short here as well. As Tom Wolfe demonstrated to
great comic effect but little practical result in "The
Painted Word," modern artists are sitting ducks for satire.
That's because this is a society that condemns painters who
earn millions from their worthless pieces of paper, but
idolizes leveraged buyout specialists who earn billions from
their worthless pieces of paper. If you're a halfway decent
writer -- which Mr. Katz is -- and you want to make
20th-century artists look stupid, you won't have much trouble
doing it, but to the credit of contemporary artists most of
them don't seem to care.
   So Mr. Katz's backhanded slaps at SoHo bohos don't work
any better than the rest of his story. Shifting back and
forth between hardboiled true-detective patter and windy
pseudo-psychologizing, Mr. Katz acts as if hundreds of pages
of mildly interesting biographical details will make "Naked
by the Window" into a big book. It isn't big; it's just
large. But there is a good book to be written on this
subject, and here's hoping some woman writes it.

   Management:
   Women Managers Quit Not for Family
   But to Advance Their Corporate Climb

   Don't expect that a day-care center or a flexible schedule
will keep women managers from leaving corporations. They're
looking for a lot more than family benefits.
   That's the message from two new surveys, which say
managerial women who quit tend to do so not because of family
obligations, but because they feel blocked from advancement.
The studies also show that women are more willing than men to
throw corporate loyalty to the wind if they aren't getting
adequate opportunities for growth and job satisfaction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a result, some management specialists warn that unless
companies begin accommodating women's desire for promotions
and respect, employers could risk increasing the already high
rate of turnover among female professionals. Right now, many
companies are merely emphasizing family issues, such as
maternity leave and day care, to attract and retain women.
   "While day care and family-oriented benefits are
important, they're not the reason women are leaving," says
Vicki Tashjian, vice president of Wick &amp; Co., a Wilmington,
Del., consulting firm. A recent study by Wick showed that of
110 male and female professionals from Fortune 500 companies
in the Northeast, 73% of the women who had left jobs quit to
work for other companies. Another 13% began their own
businesses and 7% were looking for new jobs. Only 7% left to
go home.
   "The reasons I left had nothing to do with family," says
Gloria Webster, who used to be a financial analyst for a
multinational chemical corporation. In her 14 years there,
Ms. Webster says, she won regular promotions, yet could never
break into management. Though she had supporters and good
training opportunities, she says she finally "hit what I felt
was my glass ceiling," feeling blocked as a woman by "people
who didn't want me to succeed in any way."
   Now, the 44-year-old mother of one is manager of corporate
communications for a commercial explosives business, where
employees "sink or swim on their own merits," she says. "It's
a challenge every day, and I thrive on it."
   A separate study by Opinion Research Corp., Princeton,
N.J., echoes the same sentiment. Data gathered on more than
26,500 male and female managers, supervisors and
professionals at seven big service and manufacturing
corporations revealed that women managers were more likely
than men to say they intend to leave their company within the
next year. Women also were more dissatisfied than men with
their career development. "Compared to male managers, female
managers perceive that they have fewer opportunities for
advancement and less chance of achieving their career
objectives in their organizations," the study concluded.
   Two-thirds of the women in the Wick study had children,
but when asked if there was anything going on in their
personal lives influencing their decisions to quit, women
mentioned children only 9% of the time. By contrast, men in
the study, 90% of whom had offspring, answered children 26%
of the time.
   "Women feel they do pay a pretty steep price" in either
choosing between family and career or balancing the two, says
Ms. Tashjian. Those who stick with their careers seem to feel
"they're just giving up too much not to be getting the
opportunity for work that's really meaningful," she says.
   That tolerance threshold seems lower with women than with
men. In the Wick study, 77% of the men said it was "highly
likely" they would remain with their company while just 35%
of the women said so. The study speculates that dissatisfied
men are more likely to hang on because they are trapped in
traditional notions about staying with one company.
   "Men still seem to have much more corporate loyalty," says
Ms. Tashjian, whereas "women are always thinking about
leaving," even if they are supporting families. She says the
"invisible hard choices" women must make usually rear up in a
woman's early to mid-30s, the "period of peril" when
dissatisfied women are most likely to leave a job.
   The Opinion Research survey showed that female managers
are more likely to have job turnover than male managers no
matter what their age. Even women over 40 -- a time when most
women are beyond childbearing years and have older, more
self-sufficient children -- are more likely to leave jobs
than their male counterparts.
   "If {women} were leaving because of small children, then
we'd see turnover drop among women over 40, we think. But we
don't see that," says Ellen M. Saxon, a research consultant
at Opinion Research. This study, too, found that men report
more conflict between work and family than women. "Women may
be leaving more due to the fact that they lack opportunity to
get ahead . . . rather than family and personal obligations,"
Ms. Saxon believes.
   Both sets of research challenge the wisdom of what some
derisively call a "mommy track" for women. The worlds of
business and women collided over this issue last year after
Felice Schwartz, president of Catalyst, a New York group that
specializes in women-in-business issues, argued in a Harvard
Business Review article that women cost more than men to
employ due to family-caused turnover and career interruptions
and so should be separated into "career primary" and "career
and family oriented" tracks to better retain and accommodate
both types.
   "Not one of the women in our study mentioned that she was
leaving to obtain better benefits such as maternity leave or
day-care assistance," says Wick's Ms. Tashjian. She goes so
far as to say corporate "fixation" on these family details
can detract from larger issues of women's advancement.
   Margaret Evans, a senior account director and board member
of BBDO, the New York advertising agency, says she has worked
there 11 years not because of any family benefits but because
she has been challenged by an array of interesting
assignments and rewarded with promotions. But the mother of
two toddlers says she would think "very seriously about
leaving" if she didn't enjoy her work.
   One company attempting to respond to professional women's
needs is Chubb &amp; Son Inc. At the Warren, N.J., insurer, women
have been half of entry-level professionals hired during the
past eight years. Though progress had been made, most of them
are still bunched up in the middle ranks with only a few
bursting out of the "pipeline" into more senior positions.
"Something is happening in that 10-to 12-year development
process where the playing field gets less level," says David
Fowler, Chubb's senior vice president and managing director,
who has worked with Wick to remedy that problem.
   One strategy, Mr. Fowler says, is holding managers
accountable for how they are advancing women and minorities
and publishing the results in quarterly "at-bat reports,"
which will affect bonuses. "Those branch managers who fill 30
jobs with white males bat zero, and those who fill a bunch
with women and minorities get hits," he says, adding that
financial incentive is "what will make people behave
differently."
   As for corporate America's poor track record in nurturing
women's advancement, Mr. Fowler blames a complex web of
reasons, including stereotyping by male managers who are more
comfortable working with other men, and a lack of
assertiveness by women on "managing the political process of
their career development." (In a recent survey by Catalyst,
79% of Fortune 500 chief executive officers conceded there
are identifiable barriers to women getting to the top.)
   If treatment of women managers continues as it is into the
1990s, Mr. Fowler says, women will become angry, some even
bringing legal action, and some will just plain quit. In the
end, he says, corporations will have "missed opportunities to
hire very talented ones."

   Icahn's Fight With USX Nears Conclusion

   Spinoff Plan May Lose, But
   Firm Faces Reshaping Steel Unit

<LP>
   PITTSBURGH -- Win or lose in his proxy battle against USX
Corp., New York investor Carl Icahn is succeeding in forcing
management to consider some bold initiatives.
   Early indications are that Mr. Icahn won't get a majority
of shareholders to back his proposal to divide USX into
separate steel and energy businesses. Major institutional
investors, even those voting with Mr. Icahn, doubt he will
win, and the company said it "feels good" about the response
it is getting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still not all votes have been cast. And a source close to
Mr. Icahn says the investor has 70 million votes, including
his own 34 million, and needs only an estimated one out of
four votes outstanding for a simple majority. Both sides are
spending this last week before Monday's annual shareholder
meeting courting hesitant shareholders and institutional
investors through personal meetings and an advertising blitz.
   But regardless of the outcome, Mr. Icahn has put USX on
the defensive. Executives expect to explore a number of
restructuring measures of their own. Some possibilities: more
joint ventures in the steel business or the possible sale of
part of U.S. Steel in a public stock offering.
   USX management has over the years studied extreme
alternatives to reshape its steel business, including merging
with Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation's second largest
steelmaker. And USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said he would
consider selling all or part of it when the time is right.
   "There will be additional restructuring I'm sure, and a
lot will take place on the steel side," says W. Bruce Thomas,
USX's vice chairman-administration and chief financial
officer. One possibility, he indicated, is selling 20% of the
steel business in an initial public offering. He noted that
the company considered such a move in 1988, holding
discussions with investment bankers, but couldn't get
underwriting of an offering at an acceptable price.
   "The time will come again, I hope in the next year or two,
where steel equity would be attractive to the point where it
might make sense to do something like that," he adds.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Thomas expects USX will be involved in
finding more joint venture partners to buy half of existing
steel plants or invest in new operations.
   Mr. Icahn, who holds a 13.3% stake in USX, will be
watching eagerly. "I don't intend to sell a share until it
achieves the value I think it deserves," says Mr. Icahn, who
declined to identify a proper selling price.
   Mr. Icahn wants to split USX into steel and oil operations
by spinning off at least 80% of the steel business as a
dividend to shareholders. Doing so, he contends, would boost
the value of USX stock to $48 a share, with Marathon Oil
valued at $39 a share and U.S. Steel at $9 a share. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, USX closed
at $33.125, up 37.5 cents. Shareholders will vote on the
proposal at the company's annual meeting, but an official
tally of the vote won't be known until several days later.
   Given Mr. Icahn's experience in waging proxy fights, he
could come up with more ammunition in a last-ditch effort to
rally support. Late last week he said he would be willing to
buy $800 million of USX stock at $48 a share if his proposal
passes.
   That failed to sway some institutional investors, who
credit USX management with closing outdated steel plants and
shedding lackluster operations to reduce debt and buy back
shares. They also doubt Mr. Icahn's $48-a-share estimate.
   "With the pension liabilities, retiree medical costs and
the recent low spot price of steel, I think a lot of
institutional investors don't buy the $48 a share and are
sticking by management," says one portfolio manager who
handles USX for a large fund.
   Other institutional investors have been scared off by
fears that the proposed spinoff might not be tax-free,
leaving them with huge taxes on their non-cash dividend.
   Those favoring Mr. Icahn don't expect a victory, even
though the proposal isn't binding. Dissident shareholders who
don't back up their challenge with a cash or stock offer find
proxy fights difficult to win. Moreover, some institutional
holders, especially more conservative bank trusts and
traditional money managers, typically vote with management,
as do individual shareholders interested in long-term
investments.
   "We don't believe he'll get the majority," says one
supporter, Richard Hirtle, treasurer of the North American
Security Trust, a Boston-based family of mutual funds. Still,
the funds are voting with Mr. Icahn, hoping to prod
management into further restructuring of steel operations.
   He and others note that spinoffs historically have been
successful. Moreover, Icahn backers agree that USX shouldn't
allow oil profits to support more cyclical steel operations.
   "This has allowed management to operate in a way that is
less sensitive to market forces," contends Lilli Gordon,
managing director of Institutional Voting Research Service.
Even if Mr. Icahn's proposal fails, she suggests that U.S.
Steel be required to generate its own capital through equity
or debt.
   Should Mr. Icahn fail to get the needed majority, he will
succeed in strengthening his bargaining position. "The more
votes I get the more leverage I will have in dealing with
management," says Mr. Icahn.
   That is precisely what some institutional holders want.
   Martin D. Sass, president of M.D. Sass Investors Services,
which holds 950,000 shares of USX stock, says his vote in
favor of Mr. Icahn was intended to send management a clear
message. "I think they have a mandate to move in a fairly
bold fashion, to further enhance shareholder value." That, he
says, could include stock buy-backs, an increased dividend
and more aggressive sale of assets.
   And while he's not sure Mr. Icahn's steel spinoff proposal
makes sense right now, given steel's current down cycle, he
thinks at some point USX will split energy and steel into two
companies.
   Though USX's steel business is in infinitely better shape
than it was a decade ago, Mr. Icahn still believes it acts as
a "poison pill," dragging down the overall stock price. "If
it were spun off I believe there would be bids for Marathon
alone that would not come forth if steel is part of the
picture," he says.
   USX's Mr. Thomas agrees that the stock is undervalued, but
only in that it doesn't adequately reflect the restructuring
done to date, including the $500 million stock buy-back, and
improved earnings performance. "I don't think those
improvements have been fully reflected in the stock price,"
he says.
   Mr. Thomas says that Mr. Icahn's proxy has forced
management to justify its policy to shareholders. But he
credits Mr. Icahn for being a loyal and consistent
shareholder. "He's shown a great deal of patience, I think,"
he says.

   Stride Rite Expects
   2nd-Quarter Earnings
   To Rise About 20%

   BOSTON -- Stride Rite Corp., which recently undertook its
first-time ever television advertising campaign, said it
expects its second-quarter earnings and sales to climb about
20%.
   These projections were disclosed at the Cambridge, Mass.,
shoe maker's annual meeting here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company's chairman, Arnold Hiatt, said net income for
the quarter ended May 31, is expected to equal 59 cents a
share, up from 49 cents in the year-ago period. The year-ago
per-share figures reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid in July
1989. Based on orders to be shipped in the next four weeks,
sales are projected to increase to about $146 million, up
from $122 million in last year's second quarter, Mr. Hiatt
said.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Stride Rite shares closed at $24.375, up $1.125.
   The projections triggered mixed reactions from analysts,
some of whom were pleasantly surprised.
   Barry Rothberg, an analyst for Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co., had
predicted that Stride Rite will earn about 56 cents and post
sales of about $141 million. Whether the company can maintain
the growth rate through the rest of the year remains to be
seen, he said, adding that he isn't yet upgrading his
year-end forecast of $2 a share.
   Some analysts, however, are projecting even higher
second-quarter earnings and sales, pointing out that the
company has a habit of underestimating its financial results.
   When the second-quarter numbers are posted, "earnings per
share could be a few cents higher and sales up by a few
million dollars," over yesterday's projections, said Steven
B. Frankel, an analyst for Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill Inc.
   Mr. Frankel explained that the children's division, which
has had lackluster sales, is gaining momentum. Stride Rite
recently added more jazzy colors and designs to both its
sneakers as well as its black patent-leather dress shoes,
which have been the mainstay in the line.
   Still, analysts note that Stride Rite rides on the
strength of its women's shoes, which make up about 50% of its
business.
   The shoes are featured in a new commercial airing this
spring. Results, so far, have been satisfactory, Mr. Hiatt
said. The commercial is part of what he called "an aggressive
advertising campaign" that is costing the company as much as
6% of sales, the most spent on promotions in its history.
   Mr. Hiatt said that while the company's performance, in
general, is meeting expectations, its retail stores have been
somewhat disappointing. Results at mall stores have to
improve or the company will close them, he said. The stores
were opened to serve as "a conduit for our products," he
said.
   Overall the company's retail-store division will still
lose money this year, though not as much as last year, Mr.
Hiatt projected. Expectations for next year are that the
division will break even, he added.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Jab and Feint: The Old Coach

</SO>
<LP>
   Cambridge, Mass. -- Tommy Rawson, an 81-year-old fight
trainer, is yelling instructions to two pairs of boxers.
"Jab, jab, right hand, watch your stance now." The duo on the
right is obviously new to the game. They move awkwardly in
and out of each other's range and appear surprised when they
are on either end of a successful punch. The pair on the
left, heavyweights with experience, glide easily, exchanging
crisp punches and displaying effective defense. Rawson waits
till the action reaches a crescendo then yells, "Time."
   Harvard's Malkin Athletic Center, the main gym on campus,
usually is home to such civil activities as badminton,
PingPong and ballet. But for a few hours each afternoon,
Rawson and his fighters commandeer the second-floor
mezzanine, and he teaches the intricacies of the sweet
science. While most of his charges are neophytes, Rawson
clearly is not. He's been training undergrads since Herbert
Hoover was sleeping in the White House.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I enjoy seeing them come in. Most of them start out and
they don't know how to close their fists. By the end of a
semester they're doing well and have the basics down. First
they crawl, then they walk. With the fundamentals they can
defend themselves. It's a pleasure to watch them develop
their skills."
   The better heavyweight comes over and Rawson helps him out
of his gloves. He is honor student Dennis Clark, the star
pugilist of the class of 1990 and Rawson's first heavyweight
Golden Gloves champion since 1949.
   "You look good. But I don't want you standing there after
you punch. Remember, keep moving side to side, that way you
won't give him anything to hit."
   Each year roughly 80 students come under Rawson's guidance
while only one or two go as far as fighting in outside
competition. Unlike many other schools, Harvard does not let
students fight under its name. As far as Clark and others are
concerned, it's just as well. The broken mill town of Lowell,
where the Gloves are held, is a long way from Harvard Yard
and not many fans, or judges, can be expected to look
favorably on Ivy Leaguers in their tournament. Like Jewish
and Italian fighters in the 1920s who took Irish names to
meet popular expectations, Harvard boxers fight under the
banners of gyms located on meaner streets.
   Rawson came to the ring in traditional Ivy League fashion
-- through his father. Tommy Rawson Sr. had more than 300
professional fights and was the New England featherweight
champion. Rawson the younger compiled an amazing amateur
record of 222 wins and 5 losses. Professionally, he was 82
and 7, won the New England lightweight crown, and came within
one fight of a world title shot. "In those days you had eight
world championships, today there are what, 68 titles. It's
ridiculous." While he talks Rawson is watching four fresh
fighters mix it up. One of them is eating too many jabs.
   "Time. Come here. You got a head, now let's use it. Slip
his punch when he jabs and come back with one of your own.
And keep your hands up." Rawson moves and punches to
demonstrate, still graceful a half century after retirement.
"How do you feel?" The fighter, eager to please, assures
Rawson he can go on and heads back into action.
   "Boxing is a game of skill and cleverness. A good boxer
can always outpoint a puncher. You don't want to get hit.
It's a thinking game. Not just hit me and I'll hit you like
some people believe. I get these guys in good condition
first, then you want to dovetail the conditioning and the
skills. That's what makes a good boxer."
   One thing you notice about Rawson is his influence over
his fighters. Like students in most big-time universities,
they sometimes wait weeks for 10 minutes with a professor,
but Rawson is there everyday. And he is as learned in his
field as any of Harvard's academic heavyweights.
   "Without Tommy there's no way I could have won the Gloves.
I'm constantly learning with him. The guy is unbelievable,"
says Clark, who started fighting as a freshman after a neck
injury ended a promising football career.
   "He's an inspiration; he makes you want to do well. You
know he cares about his fighters. He takes the time to make
sure you get it right," says Clark.
   "They get out of it what they put into it. We use a
handicap system to determine who's going to box who. If a guy
is new, he gets to throw everything while the more
experienced guy will just use the jab. That way I can control
things and no one gets hurt. This builds their confidence.
When I think they're ready then I let them go full out,"
Rawson says.
   "It's the best exercise there is. I don't encourage them
to compete, but if they want to, I prepare them as best I
can."
   Rawson's relationships with his fighters often last
decades. He is still in touch with Tommy Rodgers, his most
remarkable boxer. Rodgers attended Harvard in the late 50s,
and though he did not win any outside tournaments, he remains
a legend around the Harvard Boxing Club. He lost his right
arm and part of his heel in a train accident and still wanted
to be a fighter.
   "He kept coming to me and wanting to box. I didn't want to
let him, but finally I felt I had to. We used to have
on-campus bouts between the houses. He won the house
championships two years in a row. He had desire, see. And
that shows you how far it can take you."
   Despite his age Rawson shows no signs of slowing down.
When asked how long he thinks he'll be training fighters, he
smiles: "I'll be here as long as I feel all right."
   You get the impression that will be a long time.

   TOKYO -- Komei Tai is in a jam. He owes $600 million.
Creditors have seized his business. Gangsters are hunting
him. And Tokyo's haywire stock market no longer can bail him
out.
   It is the stock market's gyrations, in fact, that put him
in this jam. Mr. Tai is a professional stock speculator. A
big winner in boom times, he may well be the most notorious
victim of the Tokyo market's dramatic plunge this year.
Strewn in with his wreckage are dozens of securities firms,
financiers and a handful of companies in which he held stock.
With share prices on the stock exchange languishing, Mr.
Tai's prospects for recovery are bad. But few here show him
sympathy: Police had to rescue Mr. Tai a month ago after a
group of creditors turned hostile and tried to kidnap him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are in difficulty," admits Ryutaro Zaima, who was
managing Mr. Tai's main enterprise -- a $12.50-an-hour "love
hotel" -- before it was stormed and shut down recently by
angry lenders. Peering furtively over a cup of coffee at a
cafe, he insists he doesn't know how to contact his boss, who
has been on the lam for more than a month. Mr. Tai, through
his lawyers, declined to be interviewed for this article.
   The downfall of Komei Tai and his company, Akebono Kikaku,
is a tale of the times in Japan. In the past decade, when
Japan's market leapt to a succession of new highs,
speculators like Mr. Tai became important players. Leveraged
to the hilt with billions of dollars in borrowed money,
speculators terrorized companies with threatened takeovers or
noisy complaints. They usually demanded to be bought out at a
profit -- a practice known as greenmail -- or simply dumped
their stock back into the market when share prices rose,
making a profit for themselves but often causing losses for
other investors.
   Speculators have been a fixture in Japan's stock market
for decades, throwing their influence around in a most
un-Japanese way. But as stock and land prices boomed, their
influence has grown. Companies as big as automobile giants
Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. and camera-maker
Konica Corp. have been their targets. The companies have
retaliated by strongly supporting a change in the law
expected to go into effect this September requiring investors
to disclose significant stakes in listed companies.
   Currently, it isn't always clear who the speculators are.
Some are thought to be criminals. The body of one Osaka
speculator who police say was involved with a local crime
syndicate was found buried two years ago in a cement mixer.
Still others are corporate raiders. One group staged Japan's
first-ever hostile takeover last year when it took control of
an aerial surveying concern it had stalked. And a few have
political connections. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone has been cited in the Japanese press as being close
to at least one rich speculator group that has helped finance
his campaigns.
   This year's 25% decline in the Japanese stock market has
fueled a new worry about speculators: Many market
participants fear that the demise of a few speculator groups
could bankrupt some small securities companies or financiers
and force a desperate new selling frenzy on financial
markets.
   "An ominous mood has settled over the market," says Akira
Suzuki, a writer who specializes in stocks. On March 19, the
market suffered one of its biggest declines ever when rumors
spread that a speculator placed a large order for stock but
couldn't afford to pay for it. (The rumor proved correct.)
Reverberations from this sort of event can be felt as far
away as Wall Street. When fears spread April 4 that a major
Japanese speculator group was near collapse, U.S. investors
ran for the safety of U.S. Treasury bonds, pushing the Dow
Jones Industrial Average down 0.6%.
   Ask Yamaichi Securities Co. about the hazard speculators
pose in Tokyo. The big Japanese firm says it is facing a loss
of as much as $24 million because an unnamed speculator group
couldn't pay for an order placed during the market decline
this year. Or ask Morgan Stanley Group Inc. The U.S. firm
lost as much as $7 million in August 1988 when another
stock-market speculator here failed to pay for a block of
stock he had ordered.
   Many firms, including Morgan Stanley, say they won't deal
with any company or investor known for stock-market
speculation. But speculators operate under many names, Morgan
Stanley discovered. And as long as the fees flow, securities
firms are loath to cut off the business. "Did we make
mistakes? Yeah, and that's history," says John S. Wadsworth,
president of Morgan Stanley's Japan operation. "But there are
going to be a lot of people who are going to learn a lot of
this stuff soon."
   Since prices began tumbling at the start of the year,
securities firms here have been erecting systems to guard
against losses from speculators. Some have lists of companies
whose business they avoid; others are demanding full
collateral for stock purchases. An industry group, the Japan
Securities Dealers Association, has gathered information from
more than a dozen anxious firms about risky deals, including
those pursued by Mr. Tai. One guess circulating among
brokerage houses is that 20 firms and nearly as many finance
companies could lose money on Mr. Tai's transactions. Losses
from all the speculator groups ensnared in the market's drop
could total as much as half a billion dollars, analysts
estimate.
   Clearly, every market has its speculators. But Japan's
well-orchestrated bands share little of the legitimacy of the
arbitragers who prowl Wall Street. Known here as "shite" -- a
reference to the main actors in traditional Japanese mask
dramas -- speculators make a full-time business of
stock-market investment. That goes against the grain in
harmony-conscious Japan, where cross-holdings between
companies are the cozy norm. According to Jardine Fleming
Securities Ltd., stable shareholdings account for as much as
two-thirds of the stock market. When speculators move in,
they upset that comfortable world.
   That is why Texas oil man T. Boone Pickens Jr. caused such
a ruckus when he surfaced last year as a major investor in
Koito Manufacturing Co. Just the notion of a foreigner taking
an unsolicited bite of a Japanese auto parts company was bad
enough; but worse -- from the Japanese perspective -- was
that a speculator, Kitaro Watanabe, sold Mr. Pickens the
shares.
   A report prepared by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the
Finance Ministry last year underscored the breadth of
speculator influence on the market. The report estimated that
in the three years to March 31, 1989, 128 stocks -- or nearly
one in ten of those listed on the exchange -- were cornered
by stock-market speculators. And nearly all speculators
recoup their money; in two-thirds of the cases, the stock
prices of targeted stocks rose two- to ten-fold as a result
of speculator purchases, nearly all within two years of a
speculator group taking its stake. In 22 cases, the
speculators were bought out at a profit.
   That high success rate made speculators popular with
financiers. An entire business sprang up to fund investors
who play Japan's stock and property markets aggressively, the
so-called "machikin." So lucrative are the returns that even
big companies get involved: One of the firms that holds the
mortgage to Mr. Tai's love hotel, for instance, is Kawasaki
Enterprises Inc., a venture backed by Kawasaki Steel Corp.
and some big banks, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and
Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd.
   The new plight of several speculators has rattled many of
the machikin finance groups. "I expect a considerable number
of machikin to go belly-up," says Tatsumori Takeyama, a
spokesman for one relatively well-off machikin, Daiki Corp.
His firm, housed in its own eight-story, glass-and-marble
building in central Tokyo, figures it has the wherewithal to
survive. But he says that's only because the firm insisted on
holding blue-chip stocks as collateral for its loans to
speculators. Daiki's $4 million in loans to Mr. Tai, for
instance, were secured by big-company stocks.
   The way Mr. Takeyama sees it, for speculators "investing
in stocks is like narcotics. They can't control themselves."
But Daiki, too, has gotten caught in the rush. The company
has been trying to collect $45 million from one well-known
speculator, Seikichi Endo, who "became a beggar," in Mr.
Takeyama's words, when his sizable holdings in two regional
banks plummeted in value this year. Mr. Endo couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Mr. Endo wasn't the only speculator to get burned in that
play. Stock market sources say Mr. Tai and companies he
controls, Akebono Kikaku and Sanwa Enterprises, also were
buying stock in the banks -- Kagoshima Bank Ltd. and Higo
Bank Ltd. -- partly with money borrowed from Mr. Endo. That
reveals another common practice among Japanese speculators:
weighing in on each other's raids. Even small-time
speculators sometimes lend money to large speculator groups.
   "Mr. Tai was eaten by fellow speculators" who sold out
early, says Mr. Suzuki, the writer. Mr. Suzuki notes that
when he met Mr. Tai, he wasn't impressed. A plain dresser and
free spender, the 43-year-old Mr. Tai has a bad reputation in
Tokyo's stock-market district, Mr. Suzuki says. The reason?
"He would take profits ahead of other speculators," says Mr.
Suzuki.
   In many ways, though, Mr. Tai's experience as a
stock-market speculator was classic. He began his career
outside the market, friends and associates say, as a medical
doctor. His father, in addition to being a doctor himself,
had invested in property in Tokyo. When his father died,
Komei Tai faced an inheritance-tax bill on the property of a
sum equal to several million dollars, he explained to a
Japanese weekly magazine earlier this year. Unable to pay it
outright but determined not to sacrifice his family's
property, he began investing in the stock market -- borrowing
money against his property.
   When the stock market crashed, Mr. Tai had debts of around
$600 million, according to corporate credit banks. His main
fixed asset was his hotel, worth about $20 million, although
he had large blocks of stock held in collateral by a number
of finance firms. He held sizable stakes in several
companies, and was the largest single shareholder in Nikko
Co., a small civil engineering firm.
   Because of Mr. Tai's troubles, Nikko's share price has
plummeted two-thirds since last December, causing small
investors to call the company and complain, and making it
difficult for the company to raise new capital by issuing
stock. "It's a nuisance," a spokesman for Nikko says.
   Equally annoyed were Mr. Tai's creditors. On March 23,
after Mr. Tai issued a check in his company's name that
bounced, about 20 financiers called a meeting at a business
hotel near the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Some creditors grew
angry and tried to push Mr. Tai into a waiting automobile.
Police stopped them, concluding some were gangsters, and set
Mr. Tai free. He hasn't been seen publicly since then.
   The disappearance of Mr. Tai and the downfall of other
stock speculators may mark an important transition in Japan.
Yujiro Hayami, a stock-market observer, says he thinks
Japan's speculators will slowly fade away.
   "I don't think they will cease to exist, but {the new law
on disclosures} will make it difficult for them to behave the
way they have," he says. Now, he thinks, they may become
increasingly like America's arbitragers: willing to put money
into an investment they think will bring a quick return,
without pressing for greenmail.
   "Until recently, the Tokyo Stock Exchange wasn't a mature
market," says Charles W. Lambert, a broker at Jardine Fleming
Securities' Tokyo branch. "Now it is, and the speculators
will fall."

   LOWELL, Mass. -- Courtney Wang, youngest son of the late
An Wang, was named a director of Wang Laboratories Inc.,
taking his father's seat on the board.
   Courtney Wang, 33 years old, is a Wang Laboratories vice
president and an area sales director in Dallas. Mr. Wang's
mother, Lorraine Wang, 70, and older brother Frederick A.
Wang, 39, are already Wang directors.

   The Wang family controls the computer maker through
holdings of Class C stock that elect a majority of the board.
They have said they plan to retain their ownership.
   An Wang was chairman and chief executive officer before he
died of cancer in March. Frederick Wang was president of Wang
for two years, but he resigned last summer in the wake of
huge losses, management turmoil and a debt crisis.
   Richard Miller, 49, a former General Electric Co.
executive, succeeded Frederick Wang and after An Wang's death
was named chairman and chief executive as well.

   Alexander Cockburn's March 22 Viewpoint, "Cabbage-and-Kiwi
School of Journalism Tackles the East Bloc," reveals the
hypocrisy of the prototypical left-leaning journalist. He is
scrambling to salvage some respect for Eastern Europe's
crumbling dictatorship of the proletariat.
   He takes issue with a Washington Post dispatch from East
Berlin by Glenn Frankel. He notes that 71% of East Berlin
voters picked left-wing candidates. He follows with a
declaration that the Christian Democratic Party
(moderate-to-right leaning) seems to receive its support in
the countryside. Obviously, Mr. Cockburn will go to any
length (and sink to any depth) to support faltering left-wing
causes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Why did East Berliners lean left in their selection of
political candidates? You need only to look inside our own
Capital's Beltway for the answer. Many East Berliners, like
their Washington counterparts, are entrenched bureaucrats
whose very existence is threatened by a free-market,
capital-driven society. Their political views do not remotely
reflect the position of people in the "countryside."
   The political pulse of the East German countryside, like
our own Midwest and South, is always ignored by journalists
like Mr. Cockburn. By the way, sophisticated and hard-working
citizens of Leipzig and Dresden voted overwhelmingly for
Centrists and right-leaning candidates. The Christian
Democratic Party was supported by more East Germans than
those voting for the next three largest parties.

   ---
   Mr. Cockburn has amazed me by writing sensibly for once
(some of the article, anyway). Yes, journalists who stick
close to their hotels get a lopsided view, and the East
German Communists' 17% was heavily concentrated in East
Berlin, which seems rather natural, since that's where loyal,
ambitious Communists got promoted to. (Conservatives always
do better in the boondocks.) And empty food stores don't
necessarily mean that people are starving.
   But what of those disgracefully high-priced oranges and
kiwi fruit? Any commissar with a slide rule could demonstrate
easily that cabbages contain far more Vitamin C and calories
per mark. Still, nobody is forcing those East Berliners to
buy. "Sell it or smell it]" is the capitalist rule for
fruitmongers, and once the novelty value is over, the fruit
lady will have to cut the price, toss the oranges in the
garbage or eat them herself.

   Mr. Cockburn confuses market mechanisms. While it is true
that "in the Soviet Union prices have been . . . below
equilibrium," this is not because of "rationing by scarcity."
Rationing has little to do with it. It is because of
government price fixing. When the government sets a price
lower than the equilibrium clearing price, shortages, queues
and black markets ensue.
   In capitalism, most prices are not "above equilibrium," as
Mr. Cockburn maintains, but at equilibrium since the
government does not set the price. If it were above
equilibrium, more sellers would rush in to take advantage,
thereby depressing the price. Nor is there "rationing by
price," but allocation by price. If you can pay, you get it
-- if you can't, you don't. Thus, no shortage, queues or
black markets -- the market clears.

   Announces Layoffs

<LP>
   Campbell Soup Co. laid off 14% of the staff at its
corporate headquarters in Camden, N.J., and said it had
eliminated another 5% through attrition since Jan. 1.
   The cutbacks at the head office continue the streamlining
program started by Chief Executive Officer David W. Johnson
when he joined Campbell in January.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The maker of food products said a total of 364 positions
were eliminated, 267 through layoffs and 97 through
attrition. The staff reduction is expected to save about $17
million over the first full fiscal year, which begins in
August. All levels of staffing were affected, including
senior management.
   In an interview, Mr. Johnson said the cutbacks are
symbolic of his drive to improve productivity and boost
Campbell's earnings growth and return on equity, both of
which now rank near the bottom among major food companies. In
addition, the changes are intended to make Campbell less
bureaucratic and more efficient by eliminating layers of
supervisors and reports.
   "The headquarters is where you set the drumbeats and the
tones," Mr. Johnson said. "If I can get the drumbeats and
examples set out here, we can begin to change the vast
empire."
   Since Mr. Johnson's arrival, Campbell has put its Juice
Bowl unit on the auction block and closed several previously
targeted plants in the U.S. and United Kingdom. In addition,
several top executives have left the company. They include
Carl V. Stinnett, president of Campbell's non-grocery
business, Steven A. McNeil, head of frozen foods, and Raymond
J. Land, category general manager for convenience foods.
   Mr. Stinnett, 55 years old, took early retirement and his
job was eliminated. Mr. McNeil, 47, left to pursue other
interests and will be replaced, Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Johnson
would not comment on the departure of Mr. Land, 45.
   Mr. Johnson declined to specify which senior executives
were laid off yesterday. But he noted that Herbert M. Baum,
executive vice president in charge of Campbell's North
American operations, now has only 10 people reporting
directly to him, about half the number he had before.
   Mr. Johnson said the reorganization was necessary to his
plan to improve Campbell's financial performance rapidly. "I
can't keep sitting back and telling the shareholders to give
me another year," Mr. Johnson said. "In my first 12 months,
we're going to see the results," he vowed. He said he
expected Campbell to be exceeding food-company averages of
15% annual earnings growth and 22% return on equity by the
end of the calendar year.
   "The score card we're going to be judged on is the
quarterly report," Mr. Johnson said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Campbell closed at $50.75, unchanged.

   Punitive Damages
   Much Too Punishing

LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)

<LP>
   L. Gordon Crovitz's March 14 Rule of Law, "Absurd Punitive
Damages Also `Mock' Due Process," is on the mark. To take it
another step, since punitive damages are in the nature of a
fine for wrongdoing, why should the plaintiff be the
recipient? The victim of a criminal act does not receive the
money from the fine assessed against the felon. Prior to
assessing punitive damages, the legal process calculates and
awards actual damages. This should be enough for the
plaintiff. If the defendant acted outrageously in his
dealings with the plaintiff and by the judgment made him
whole with the award for damages, and if society desires to
punish him for his outrageous behavior, then the money so
raised should go to the same place that criminal fines go --
to the government.
   The attorney successfully pursuing a punitive-damages
award should be compensated for his efforts. The
court-awarded fee should be a reflection of time and effort
spent and not a percentage of the award. It should be
limited, however, to the award. The taxpayers should not be
digging in their pockets to compensate a losing effort.

   Mr. Crovitz's column misleads readers about the extent to
which corporations may claim due-process protections under
the Constitution.
   Mr. Crovitz would expand broadly the due-process clause to
have it strike down punitive-damage awards made against
"deep-pocketed corporations." But there is nothing in the
language or the legislative history of the due-process clause
that suggests it was designed to protect large corporations
from jury awards that compensate injured individuals.
   Mr. Crovitz would read into the due-process clause
protections for corporations because to do so would fit his
version of economic reality: that punitive damages are bad
for business.
   Unfortunately for Mr. Crovitz, the Supreme Court long ago
abandoned the idea that 19th-century laissez-faire economic
principles (like those espoused by Mr. Crovitz) should be
incorporated into the due-process clause.
   For Mr. Crovitz it is too late to turn back the clock to
an era of laissez faire. For corporations, punitive damages
will continue to serve as an important deterrent function.

   I wish Mr. Crovitz had carried his excellent article to
its ultimate logical conclusion: the total abolition of
punitive damages. They constitute a flagrant violation of the
principle that no punishments of any kind belong in a civil
case.
   But then, legal principles have long ago ceased to have
any meaning in our corrupt judicial system, except the one
that says: "The lawyers' pockets shall be filled."
   Paul G. Kafka

   ---
   I much admire Mr. Crovitz's practical analysis of our
courts' problems with punitive damages. We can solve almost
all of them, avoiding much argument and legalistic
scholasticism, by forbidding the use of punitive damage
awards in the calculation of the plaintiff attorney's fee.
Since punitive damages are a punishment, applied for social
purposes, they should be paid only to the courts for their
maintenance and operations.
   Plaintiffs' lawyers also must be denied the enjoyment of
any part of the money juries award plaintiffs for pain and
suffering. Why should the defendant console the lawyer, who
didn't suffer?

   CML Encounters the Perils of Growth by Acquisitions
   ---
   Most of the Companies Purchased
   In Buying Binge Didn't Work Out
   ----

CORPORATE PROFILE (PRO)
TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)
</IN>
<LP>
   Charles M. Leighton acquires companies more often than
most entrepreneurs buy cars. In 20 years, he has purchased 16
companies that make everything from sailboats to
do-it-yourself clock kits.
   He has tried to assemble a group of companies that cater
to well-off consumers who play as hard as they work. But in
the course of his shopping spree, Mr. Leighton learned what
can go wrong when an entrepreneur expands through
acquisitions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of the acquisitions haven't worked out. Mr.
Leighton's company, CML Group Inc., Acton, Mass., has shed
all but four of the 16 concerns. It sold some at huge losses.
Others fetched less than Mr. Leighton planned when the buyers
couldn't come up with all the money. Even promising companies
kept by Mr. Leighton have cost him dearly. Last year, for
instance, CML had to buy out the contract of a unit's two
founders who were getting unexpectedly huge bonuses
approaching a total of $10 million a year.
   The buying binge saddled CML with debt -- its $115.8
million in long-term liabilities dwarfs its $4.4 million in
tangible equity -- and deficits. The company reported a loss
of $31.9 million on sales of $234.6 million in its fiscal
year ended July 31, 1989, and a loss of $1,850,000 on sales
$159.9 million in the six months ended Jan. 27.
   Problems with acquisitions have attracted Minneapolis
investor Irwin Jacobs, who owns 14.8% of CML's stock but
thinks it is undervalued. He has tried since November to buy
the company. Last month, he called off an attempt to oust
CML's board after Mr. Leighton assured him the company's
performance would improve.
   "We've learned from our mistakes, and our record is not a
bad one," says Mr. Leighton, CML's 54-year-old chairman.
"We're finally starting to produce what we've been trying to
do for the last 20 years."
   Mr. Leighton means he believes CML at last has in place a
winning combination of acquisitions, such as P.S.I.
NordicTrack Inc., a Chaska, Minn., maker of
cross-country-skiing exercise machines. America's
health-consciousness helped increase annual sales to $74.4
million in fiscal 1989 from $14.2 million in 1986, when CML
bought it. Nature Co., a Berkeley, Calif., retailer of gifts
for nature lovers, is prospering from growing attention to
the environment. Annual sales since CML bought it in 1983
soared tenfold to $50.6 million.
   Overall, Mr. Leighton projects CML's earnings from
continuing operations during the fiscal year ending July 31,
1990, will grow to at least $12.8 million from a loss on
continuing operations of $5.5 million a year earlier.
   Some analysts, however, still wonder if the company has
turned the corner. Says Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill's Harry Wells
III, "CML has always been a story that's about to get
better."
   Mr. Leighton, together with President G. Robert Todd,
still owns 9.6% of the company, which the two founded in
1969. Less than a year later, Mr. Leighton purchased Boston
Whaler Inc., a Rockland, Mass., powerboat builder, and
Carroll Reed Inc., a Portland, Maine, apparel retailer. Mr.
Leighton bought a third company in 1970 and, by the end of
1973, had added five more, including Ericson Yachts Inc.,
Irvine, Calif. In a second wave of acquisitions beginning in
1979, CML picked up eight more companies.
   But by 1985, 16 acquisitions later, Mr. Leighton began
selling companies even faster than he had bought them. Some
small apparel retailers ran into competition from big
national firms, says CML Vice President Michael Wilder. As
for companies making clothing, camping products and other
goods, Mr. Leighton failed to get them enough shelf space in
stores. "Charlie decided fighting your way into the retail
distribution network was just too damn hard," Mr. Wilder
says.
   Even though Mr. Leighton in the past six years alone has
sold 10 of the 16 companies he acquired, analysts say he
waited too long to unload some of them. By the time CML sold
Boston Whaler, the venerable and once immensely profitable
manufacturer was losing $3 million a year. Reebok
International, which acquired the boat builder, originally
planned to spend $42 million. It ended up paying only $29.8
million, plus possibly $3 million more in contingency
payments, when it completed the deal last October.
   "We get very emotionally attached to these companies," Mr.
Leighton concedes. "We're not in the business to buy and sell
them. Because we are so involved, we have a tendency to wait
longer than just a numbers guy. Plus, can you attract the
next company if they think you're just going to get rid of
them" when times get bad?
   Such allegiance to owners may have cost Mr. Leighton in
other ways as well. He chose at times to sell companies back
to management rather than outsiders, as long as the managers'
offer was competitive. Now, though, some former associates
can't come up with all the money to pay Mr. Leighton's price.
In the 1989 fiscal year, CML wrote off $1.6 million of notes
it took from the buyers of Ericson Yachts and other
companies. It also set aside another $3 million to cover
future bad debts.
   In addition, Mr. Leighton paid more than expected for
companies he still owns. CML usually wooed companies it
acquired with promises to keep the owners and managers, give
them financial incentives to expand the business quickly and
profitably and allow them plenty of freedom to do so.
Sometimes the arrangement worked too well.
   When CML bought NordicTrack, Mr. Leighton agreed to share
the company's income through July 1991 with founders Ed and
Florence Pauls. By 1989, NordicTrack had become the most
profitable company CML owned, with an estimated operating
profit of $28 million that fiscal year, according to Dan
Wewer, an analyst at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. The
Pauls, as a result, were raking in huge and rapidly rising
bonuses that last year doubled to $9.6 million -- which CML
had to borrow to pay.
   With two years of the agreement remaining, Mr. Leighton in
1989 bought out the Paul's contract for $25.7 million. "If we
did it again with another company, we'd put a ceiling on the
amount of dollars the bonus would pay," Mr. Leighton says.
   Mr. Leighton, in fact, has altogether altered the way he
acquires companies. Where he used to buy them outright, he
now is investing only in small firms whose owners grant CML
the right to buy their company at book value in five years.
In exchange, CML, which has made three such deals so far with
small specialty retailers, provides them with management
advice and financial support.
   "We'll be testing the marketplace and growth potential of
a company before we bring it into CML," Mr. Leighton says.
"If we like what we see, then we can exercise our option."

   Evidence of increasingly robust economic growth gave stock
prices a little boost while pushing bond prices lower.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.16 points to
2668.92 in moderate trading. Long-term bond prices slipped
about 3/8 point, or about $3.75 for each $1,000 of face
amount, while the dollar was mixed. The big May Day holiday
in Europe curtailed trading action in both the bond and
currency markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Investors were caught by surprise when the National
Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index
of economic activity for April jumped to 50.2% from 48.9% in
March. Economists had expected only a tiny increase in the
measure of the nation's industrial economy. If the index is
below 50% the economy is presumed to be contracting, while
readings above 50% show an expanding economy. The April
level, the highest in a year, tends to support a view that
the economy and inflation are both picking up steam.
   The immediate effect of the purchasing manager's report
was a modest retreat in bond prices, which had risen slightly
in early New York trading. Bond investors have been shaken in
recent weeks by the mounting evidence that inflation is
accelerating. Accelerating inflation is expected to force the
Federal Reserve to boost short-term interest rates sometime
soon and the purchasing managers' report will, if anything,
advance the Fed's timetable.
   While they await a Fed move, bond traders are braced, too,
for today's Treasury announcement about next week's big
quarterly refunding auction. They worry that Japanese
investors won't be aggressive buyers since interest rates in
Japan are competitive with rates available here. If Japanese
investors shun the auction, yields on the Treasury issues
will have to rise to attract other buyers.
   But if rising economic activity worries bond investors, it
leaves stock investors in a quandary. On the plus side, a
more robust economy could spur corporate earnings to higher
levels later this year. But the higher interest rates that
usually accompany rising inflation increase the cost of doing
business. And if the Federal Reserve really cracks down and
pushes short-term rates sharply higher to curb inflation, the
economy could slip into a recession.
   Right now investors are taking a positive view, noting
that International Business Machine Chairman John Akers on
Monday predicted a "substantially improved" performance this
year.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
totaled 149 million shares. Advancing issues on the Big Board
were ahead of decliners 820 to 679.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year
issue lost 3/8 point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 of face
amount. The yield on the issue rose to 9.03%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar barely budged. In late New York trading the
currency was quoted at 1.6808 marks and 158.83 yen compared
with 1.6796 marks and 158.90 yen Monday.

   Melodramas have their place even in law, but so far the
atmospherics have obscured the Michael Milken tragedy. The
shadows will some day recede. Do not be surprised if the
Greek chorus then moans a deeper loss than the personal
anguish of Mr. Milken. A legal system that could declare
itself satisfied with last week's plea bargain is a system
headed for a fall.
   Proportionality and fairness crumpled to give way to the
prosecution of Mr. Milken: The prosecutorial tactics were a
cannon to the flea of the six eventual pleas by Mr. Milken.
His plea has little to do with the original indictment's
allegations. The liquidation of Drexel Burnham Lambert and
Mr. Milken's $600 million fine completely dwarf the harm done
to clients and investors, which likely comes to less than $1
million. Without minimizing his offenses, the Justice
Department and Securities and Exchange Commission have some
explaining to do.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Milken has settled for some jail time and a possibly
partly tax-deductible fine. What remains unclear is how great
a criminal we should view Mr. Milken or how proud we should
be of our legal system for winning this plea bargain.
   Let's first understand what Mr. Milken did not admit. The
indictment was 98 charges of racketeering, insider trading
and a manipulation scam underlying the junk-bond and takeover
markets.
   No one seems to have noticed that Mr. Milken did not admit
to any of the charges as originally described in the
indictment. Instead, prosecutors indicted first, asked
questions later. As Justice Robert Jackson warns nearby, few
things are as dangerous as a prosecutor who finds a target,
then looks for crimes to pin on him.
   It was no surprise that Mr. Milken did not admit to any
RICO counts -- these were included solely as rubber hoses to
bludgeon a plea. But Mr. Milken also did not admit to any
insider trading. In other words, those who consider him a
common crook must also think he is an idiot. At the peak of
the takeover battles, Mr. Milken had huge amounts of inside
information, probably more inside information than everyone
else in the market combined. Prosecutors apparently didn't
find a single case of misusing this information.
   Most important, this means Mr. Milken is no Ivan Boesky, a
real crook who made easy money by trading suitcases of cash
for stolen inside information. So why did prosecutors agree
to give Mr. Boesky a reduced sentence for fingering Mr.
Milken? Maybe they assumed there was more to the Milken case
than exists. After all, former prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani
also leaped to wrong conclusions in the aborted
insider-trading indictment of investment bankers Robert
Freeman, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor.
   Of the six crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded, only three
were in the indictment in even a distorted form. The
Fischbach takeover, for example, is better viewed as Mr.
Boesky leaning on Mr. Milken for a favor than the other way
around. The indictment didn't mention the one crime where Mr.
Milken harmed clients. This was a commission-shaving scheme
that cost clients several hundred thousand dollars -- though
legally if only disclosed.
   His lawyers noted that most of Mr. Milken's crimes were
accommodating the more serious offenses of others. Mr. Milken
said he knew at the time that his acts were wrong, but didn't
say he knew that they were crimes. Until recent years no one
could have imagined that victimless offenses such as aiding
and abetting someone else in filing a false net capital Form
X-17A-5 or an incomplete disclosure 13-D Form would warrant
more than a harsh letter from the SEC or a nominal fine.
   If prosecutors were so sure of their case, why the
extraordinary pressure on Mr. Milken to cop a plea? RICO
makes a farce of the entire case. The Justice Department's
own prosecutorial guidelines prohibit such "imaginative
prosecutions" under the anti-mobster law because of RICO's
brutal force.
   RICO meant Mr. Milken faced a possible jail sentence of
520 years and a fine of $11 billion. We lack the finality of
a trial partly because the Princeton/Newport trial put Mr.
Milken on notice that vague RICO allegations of fraud are
enough for convictions. Prosecutors made his lawyer brother
an indicted co-racketeer even though he had little to do with
the allegedly illegal transactions. Settling freed the
brother as a RICO hostage.
   It's also possible that some prosecutors actually equate
investment banking and racketeering. One lawyer recounts the
chilling response he got when he tried to persuade top
Justice officials that RICO was inappropriate in a securities
case. A Justice official asked, "Isn't putting a company in
play criminal and an act of racketeering?" It explains a lot
if prosecutors think hostile takeovers are crimes.
   I also understand that to get the plea prosecutors
threatened new indictments in every state where a savings and
loan bought bonds from Drexel. Trying to smear Mr. Milken
with the thrift mess would have been high irony; until
Congress forced fire sales, junk bonds were among thrifts'
safer investments. Mr. Milken must have wondered what next?
when an FBI agent was dispatched to interrogate his
92-year-old grandfather.
   After all this, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said this
shows the government won't abide "crime in the suites." SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden held a press conference to say that
Mr. Milken's "admissions today demonstrate that he stood at
the center of a network of manipulation, fraud and deceit."
   What this case in fact shows is that if prosecutors had
the courage of Mr. Milken's supposed convictions, they should
have dropped the abusive RICO counts and gone to court. Now
prosecutors will use their sentencing memorandum to the judge
to retry the case without risk of rebuttal.
   Mr. Milken's great accomplishments do not excuse cutting
legal corners, but justice requires viewing Mr. Milken by all
that he did with his financial genius. His hubris was that
getting the deals done came to be more important than
remembering that even in the most advanced societies
renegades get no margin for error. In the end, prosecutorial
abuses yield the best perspective on the Milken plea.

   Emerson Electric
   Enters Guilty Plea
   In Pentagon Case

   Emerson Electric Co. pleaded guilty in federal court in
St. Louis to inflating cost proposals on certain military
contracts, and agreed to pay $14 million as part of a
settlement with the government.
   The agreement stems from allegations by the government
that at least from Jan. 1, 1983, to Sept. 30, 1987, Emerson's
Electronics and Space division submitted "false and inflated"
cost and price figures on contracts on which it was the only
supplier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Specifically, Emerson pleaded guilty to four counts of
making false statements on government contracts for equipment
used to test instruments on military aircraft. In addition to
the $14 million civil settlement, which goes to the Defense
Department, the company agreed to pay fines totaling $40,000.
   The settlement closes a two-year grand jury investigation
of the St. Louis maker of electric and electronic products.
The investigation became public in February 1988 when a team
of Defense Department investigators made a surprise search of
the division's Ferguson, Mo., plant.
   Investigators were trying to determine whether the company
illegally switched military vehicle parts from a U.S. program
to vehicles sold to Egypt.
   U.S. Attorney Thomas E. Dittmeier, whose office led the
investigation, said in an interview the search led to
evidence of the cost overestimates. He also said his office
found "possible criminal violations" in Emerson's parts
transfer practices, but said it allowed the company to plea
only to the cost charges as part of the agreement.
   Joe Adorjan, Emerson vice chairman, denied in an interview
any wrongdoing by the company in the parts transfer area. But
he called the guilty plea on the cost charges "a serious
event for us."
   Emerson said it negotiated the civil settlement to
"resolve a number of open issues" with the Defense
Department. It also said in a statement that the agreement
"is in the best economic interest of shareholders." It said
it included the settlement in its second-quarter results
announced yesterday, in which it said profit rose nearly 6%
to $156.2 million, or 70 cents a share. Sales rose nearly 6%
to $1.91 billion.
   While it's not about to interrupt Emerson's 32-year string
of higher earnings, the plea agreement further tarnishes the
company's reputation in the defense business. The Defense
Department could still bar the company from contracts, but
Mr. Adjoran said in the interview that the company is
"optimistic" that won't happen.
   Both Emerson Electric and the U.S. attorney said the
company corrected the cost-estimating systems before the
government investigation began, and that Emerson cooperated
in the investigation.
   Early last year, the Navy suspended Emerson's Hazeltine
unit from competing for and receiving new government
contracts. The three-month suspension came after Hazeltine
pleaded guilty to conspiracy and other charges in the
Pentagon procurement scandal.
   In March 1989, a former Hazeltine executive was sentenced
to three months in jail after admitting that he conspired to
obtain inside information about competitors' bids on a
contract.

   WHAT IF APRIL 15 were just another spring day for paid-up
taxpayers?
   That's what the IRS wants to make it in 1992, by
eliminating over six million formal requests for filing
extensions. That many people whose returns weren't ready
needed tax-day postmarks on Form 4868 requests for extensions
to Aug. 15. Taxpayers expended seven million hours and over
$1.5 million in postage on the forms, the IRS figures; it
allots the equivalent of over 250 annual jobs to do the
paperwork. Yet 80% of the extended returns will claim
refunds. Couldn't that time and expense be saved?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The IRS Commissioner's Advisory Group of outside tax
experts posed that question last year. The IRS replied last
week: It plans to do away with Form 4868 requests for 1991
returns due in 1992 and to make extensions really automatic.
Returns filed by Aug. 15 would be treated as filed on time --
as long as the filers had made minimum tax payments by April
15 through withholding or other means. The IRS would approve
or deny extensions after returns were filed.
   The minimum payment required now is either 90% of the
current year's liability or 100% of the prior year's tax.
                                                                                                       

   AUTOMATIC EXTENSIONS would be effortless in 1992 for folks
owed refunds.
   They would merely delay their refunds by filing returns
after April 15. For people owing tax, the IRS will devise a
payment coupon due April 15. Those paying at least 90% of the
tax by April 15 and the balance with returns by Aug. 15 would
incur interest on the balance, but no penalty. Filers who
paid 100% of the prior year's tax but less than 90% of the
current year's by April 15 would owe interest and a
failure-to-pay penalty on the balance paid Aug. 15, but not
the heavier failure-to-file penalty.
   Details must be ironed out. Now, taxpayers may seek a
further return extension to Oct. 15 by filing Form 2688. The
IRS is considering making that extension automatic as well,
for people who qualify for the first extension and who pay
100% of the tax due by Aug. 15; people who don't pay 100%
would have to request a hardship extension in writing. The
IRS hasn't decided whether refund returns would qualify for
automatic extensions to Oct. 15 instead of Aug. 15.
                                                                                                       

   INCOME GUARANTEES to new doctors don't jeopardize this
hospital's exemption.
   A 1986 IRS opinion said a guarantee to a nonemployee
doctor might divert hospital earnings to private use and void
its charitable exemption. But lawyer Gerald Peters of
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &amp; Enersen, San Francisco, says the
IRS has approved a plan that is "a significant structural
breakthrough" for an unidentified 512-bed hospital. Trying to
resuscitate its failing cancer-therapy program, the hospital
offered one-year guarantees of $75,000 and $150,000 to two
doctors to set up private practices nearby and manage the
program.
   The guaranteed income would be reduced by the amounts of
the doctors' private income; and the doctors are to repay the
hospital's advances, in installments over four years. But the
hospital would waive part of the repayment for each year a
doctor stayed on and forgive 100% of the debt if the doctor
stayed four years.
   The plan is in accord with exempt hospital aims, as long
as the compensation is reasonable, the IRS ruled.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHIEF OF STAFF of Congress's joint tax committee,
Ronald A. Pearlman, plans to resign at the end of the year. A
lawyer, he says he hasn't decided where he will go. His
successor hasn't been named. Pearlman has headed the staff
since March 1988 and served earlier as assistant Treasury
secretary for tax policy.
                                                                                                       

   GAMBLING LOSSES appeared improperly on business schedules
of many 1989 personal returns. Other common problems, say IRS
compliance checkers, were errors in figuring employee
business costs and in reporting dependent-care costs and
rollovers of individual-retirement-account funds.
                                                                                                       

   STATE AUDITORS from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, New
Hampshire, and Pennsylvania are visiting 1,016 Southern
California firms that may owe sales or corporate taxes. The
teams have scoured the Silicon Valley and Washington areas.
North Carolina's Research Triangle may be next.
                                                                                                       

   ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S estate must pay tax on homes he gave to
family members.
   Over 15 years after the national black Muslim leader's
death, the Tax Court has ruled on issues involving his gifts
of four homes near his own in Chicago to two sons and a
daughter and their spouses and to one grandson. The family
members held high posts in the sect. They provided protection
for the leader and helped care for him during his last
illness. Shortly before dying in February 1975, Elijah
Muhammad gave them the homes they had been living in.
   The estate contended that the leader transferred the
homes, valued at $120,000 each, in return for adequate
consideration, including services rendered. But the IRS said
the transfers were taxable gifts. Now Judge Fay says the
estate produced no evidence beyond uncorroborated testimony
to support its claim. The judge says the gifts were made in
contemplation of death and are subject to gift tax and that
the homes must be included in the estate's value.
   But the judge has rejected the IRS's assessment of
negligence penalties.

   CLEVELAND -- Society Corp. said it settled a shareholder
suit pending against Trustcorp Inc., Toledo, before Trustcorp
was merged into Society last Jan. 5.
   The settlement, subject to approval by the federal court
in Toledo, calls for Society to pay $5.6 million, the company
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Society, a bank holding company with assets of $15.4
billion, said the settlement isn't expected to have a
significant impact on 1990 earnings. Society said it is
seeking reimbursement under insurance in force at the time
the suit was filed.
   Early in 1989, six shareholders or former shareholders of
Trustcorp filed suit against Trustcorp and certain of its
officers and directors. The suit alleged that misleading
statements about Trustcorp's loan portfolio and general
condition caused the plaintiffs to lose money by purchasing
Trustcorp shares that were artificially inflated in price
because company statements failed to reveal problems in the
loan portfolio. The stock subsequently fell when the bank
holding company made large additions to loan-loss reserves.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Society closed at
$28.75, down 75 cents.

   How Many Is Enough?

   KALISPELL, Mont. -- The solitary monarch of the wild, the
grizzly rules the rugged high country. Scientists call it
"Ursus arctus horribilus," and the name suggests the terror
it inspires. Fearless and unpredictable, the bear can kill
with a single rake of a claw.
   Man is the grizzly's only natural enemy, but the clash
almost proved fatal to the species. Unrestricted hunting and
development of the animal's habitat decimated the bear
population over the last century. By 1975, when the grizzly
was placed on the federal government's Endangered Species
List, only 1,000 were thought to be alive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, federal officials say the grizzly population has
rebounded, though they concede there is no hard evidence to
support that conclusion, and they are proposing to take the
bear off the list.
   Many environmentalists, however, believe that even if the
number of bears has increased, the grizzly population is
still too small to strip the animal of federal protection.
Such a plan, they say, would be a death sentence for the
species. "If the grizzly bear is delisted, it will be
strangled by development and go extinct quite promptly," says
Lance Olsen, president of the nonprofit Great Bear
Foundation.
   Under the plan proposed by the National Parks Service,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land
Management, and the U.S. Forest Service, the grizzly would be
taken off the list in this northwestern corner of Montana,
including Glacier National Park, within the next two years.
If all goes well, the animal would be delisted next in
Yellowstone National Park, which is largely in Wyoming.
   "We came to the conclusion that the population has
recovered to our goal" of 440 in this corner of Montana, says
Lorraine Mintzmeyer, chairman of the agencies' grizzly
committee and a regional director of the National Park
Service. However, Ms. Mintzmeyer says she doesn't know how
many grizzlies there were in that area before federal
protection was extended.
   Some 535 species have the dubious distinction of having
made the Endangered Species List since it was established in
1973. The law provides for special protections, including
fines of up to $15,000 for those who illegally kill
threatened species. The grizzly would be the sixth species to
have recovered enough in the view of federal officials to be
taken off the list.
   Several environmental groups, including Mr. Olsen's, say
they will fight to halt the delisting process. They maintain
that the agencies are bowing to pressure from real estate,
tourism and logging interests, who long have sought relief
from the federal law. "We're delisting before we even know
what recovery is," says Louisa Willcox of the Greater
Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental group.
   Complicating the issue is the difficulty of determining
how many grizzlies roam the Rockies and their foothills.
Everyone concedes that the 1,000 figure for 1975 was only a
guess. Attempts to take a bear census in the years since then
have proved difficult, and no one knows how many grizzlies
there are now.
   Richard Mace, a wildlife biologist for the state of
Montana, knows how tough it is to count grizzlies. Displaying
a battered steel box with a jagged rip down one side, he
explains that the box once held a tree-mounted camera that
was rigged to snap photos when it sensed body heat from a
large animal. Biologists had placed some 43 cameras in a
section of Montana's Swan Mountains, hoping to get a more
accurate bear count.
   Apparently, Mr. Mace says, when the camera flashed, the
grizzly slashed. Its two-inch long claws ripped through the
steel casing, which is a bit thicker than a coffee can. The
bear dug out the camera, and chewed it to pieces.
   To many, the grizzly symbolizes all that was wild about
the American West. Lewis and Clark were among the first
explorers to describe the great bear. Indians, they wrote in
their journal, so greatly feared the beast that before a hunt
warriors would don paint and perform rituals as though they
were about to go to war against a neighboring tribe.
   The average bear reaches a height of six to eight feet,
and some big males may weigh as much as a half-ton. Yet
grizzlies are surprisingly nimble; they can run as fast as 25
miles an hour. Ferocious carnivores, they also dine on
berries, fruits and the succulent grasses of mountain
meadows.
   The grizzly once ruled the food chain from the Canadian
border to Mexico, from the Black Hills of South Dakota to
California. It wandered the plains and mountains until the
early 1900s, when it was pushed back into the high country by
advancing hordes of settlers. Today, the grizzly roams only
six pockets of Wyoming, Idaho, Washington and Montana.
   Chris Servheen is responsible for developing the federal
program to remove the bear from the endangered species list
in Montana, but the prospect of a bear unprotected obviously
concerns him. The slight, bespectacled wildlife biologist
smooths out a map of grizzly territory atop his desk and
points to what he thinks will be trouble spots: a proposed
oil and gas well just south of Glacier National Park,
residential lots for sale along the North Fork of the
Flathead River, and a mosaic of logging roads that snake
through mountain forests. "It scares me a lot," he admits.
   Mr. Servheen probably should worry more about the likes of
Jerry Wellington of Whitefish, Mont. Mr. Wellington doesn't
share environmentalists' fascination with the animal. He
subscribes to a code once commonly called by folks here as
"shoot, shovel and shut up."
   "I think they ought to shoot them all," says the burly,
bearded electrician, tinkering with a broken ice machine at a
tavern on the south edge of Glacier National Park. He says
the grouchy bear makes it hard for him to fish the back
country. He still goes, but armed. He won't say whether he
has shot bear, but he vows no law would stop him if he were
threatened by one. "I wouldn't tell anyone," he says. "It
just gets you in trouble."
   Not always. Westerners take a broad view of the term
"self-defense" when it comes to the grizzly. One day last
summer, according to court documents, three bears loped
across the yard of a ranch outside Dupuyer, Montana. A
concerned neighbor called to alert the owner, who grabbed his
gun, jumped into his pickup truck, and chased the bears
several miles down a road. After firing several rounds, he
killed one of the grizzlies. In February, a federal court
jury acquitted him, saying the shooting was in self defense.
   But it isn't all bad news for bears. The state of Montana
plans to draft its own program to protect the bear. And
respect for the grizzly seems to be growing among ranchers.
Many are taking precautions to keep the bear from wandering
too close to their homes and livestock. The ranchers are
putting their garbage cans at greater distances from the
homes; some are even shutting down their boneyards, where
they used to throw livestock carcasses. Now, some dump them
in the mountains, so that hungry bears don't wander out onto
the plains for food.
   A broad shift in attitude will be crucial in the future,
especially if the bear is delisted. "If you don't have local
support," says Mr. Mace, "you can't save the species."

   DALLAS -- Hallwood Energy Partners L.P. said its offer to
exchange its units for interests in 18 oil and gas
partnerships brought in tenders representing an estimated
$22.5 million in limited partnership interests, or roughly
one-third of the total assets it was soliciting.
   The company said a majority of the limited partners of
Hutton/Apache 1982 Energy Income Fund Ltd. and Hutton/Apache
Energy Income Fund II agreed to swap their $13.9 million in
limited partner interests for Hallwood units, receiving one
Hallwood unit for each $15 of exchange value. In addition,
limited partner interests representing $8.6 million in
exchange value in the other partnerships also tendered their
interests.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hallwood had estimated the value of the reserves in the 18
partnerships at about $66 million.
   Hallwood said it expects to complete its merger with
Energy Development Partners Ltd. and the limited partners
next week, giving it reserves of about 9.8 million barrels
and 142 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
   Earlier this month, unit holders of Energy Development
agreed to merge with Hallwood and to receive 0.34 Hallwood
unit for each Energy Development unit.

   Two makers of high-performance hard-disk drives reported
strong earnings gains in the fiscal fourth quarter ended
March 31, reflecting strong demand from makers of personal
computers, workstations and computer networks.
   Quantum Corp., based in Milpitas, Calif., said net income
rose 86% to $12.8 million, or 46 cents a share, from $6.9
million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 67%
to $129.8 million from $77.7 million. A competitor, Maxtor
Corp., based in San Jose, Calif., said net jumped more than
fourfold to $6.5 million, or 30 cents a share, from $1.4
million, or seven cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
climbed 45% to $141.6 million from $97.7 million.

<TEXT>
   Both companies reported strong gains in sales of new 3
1/2-inch disk products, earnings from certain discontinued
products and continued strong demand for older products from
computer makers. Quantum also announced that its board
approved a plan to buy back up to three million shares of its
common stock in the open market.
   Quantum reported fiscal 1990 earnings of $47.2 million, or
$1.71 a share, up nearly fourfold from $12.9 million, or 45
cents a share, in fiscal 1989. Sales more than doubled to
$446.3 million from $208 million. For the fiscal year, Maxtor
reported net of $18.9 million, or 90 cents a share, more than
three times the $5.2 million, or 26 cents a share, earned in
fiscal 1989. Sales rose 40% to $491.1 million from $351
million.

   Tens of thousands of Soviet radicals jeered President
Mikhail Gorbachev and the rest of the Soviet leadership
Tuesday, turning the May Day parade through Red Square into a
ringing denunciation of 72 years of Communist rule.
   ---
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So began a Reuters dispatch describing the extraordinary
scene that unfolded in Red Square yesterday. An estimated
100,000 Soviet citizens entered the square behind the
official, pro-government marchers and began shouting,
"Freedom] Freedom]" and "Politburo, Resign]" and "Down with
the KGB]" "A president from the people]" the crowd yelled,
while Mikhail Gorbachev and the Politburo on the dais stared
down.
   Just to describe the banners and flags carried by the
crowd provides Western readers an unusual sense of the
discontent building in the Soviet Union: "Down with the
empire of Red fascism," said another. "Down with the Cult of
Lenin." "Socialism, no thanks." "A Dictator is a President
Without an Election."
   The red, yellow and green flag of the Lithuanian republic
was prominent in the procession. "The Lithuanian Blockade is
the President's Shame," read one sign. Another, "Today a
blockade of Lithuania, tomorrow a blockade of Moscow."
   Other marchers carried the red, white and blue colors of
pre-revolutionary Russia. Some carried flags of non-Soviet
Ukraine. Some even carried Soviet flags with the
hammer-and-sickle cut out, precisely the device used by the
Romanians who took to the streets in bloody battles with the
Securitate forces, while the Ceaucescus fell.
   After about 20 minutes of this, enough became enough and
the leadership atop the Lenin Mausoleum disappeared for the
peace and quiet of the dachas.
   ---
   Events are moving rapidly in the U.S. as well. Yesterday
the White House announced that on Thursday President Bush
would meet at the White House with Lithuanian Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene. Only a week ago, Ms. Prunskiene was
saying that State Department officials had refused her a
visa, hinting that she try to come in June, after the
Bush-Gorbachev summit in late May. Now she will spend all day
Thursday pleading her case to the President and Members of
Congress.
   A positive reading of these developments would be that the
political leadership in both East and West is at last
beginning to see the dangers in failing to recognize the
legitimate interests of all those who have a stake in the
evolution from totalitarianism to self-determination. In
particular, they may be starting to appreciate that the issue
reaches far beyond "ethnic unrest" in the Balkans or Baltic
Republic. Lithuanian nationalists and Russian democrats
understand that their cause is one.
   In a poll published by Izvestia Monday, 92% of Latvian
ethnics favored secession from the Soviet Union, but so did
45% of Latvian residents of other ethnic extractions,
primarily Russians. Thousands of miles from Red Square
yesterday, demonstrators in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, were
marching to support hunger strikers demanding press freedom
and a faster evolution to full democracy. As the Red Square
demonstrations suggest, many Soviets now hate the very word
"communism.'
   It is no doubt likely that there are large elements in the
general population, or in the army and government, who oppose
tossing over the current system. Absent any mechanism such as
a popularly elected government for absorbing these emotions,
the Soviet Union is ripe for civil war. This is an unsettling
prospect for a nation possessed of vast firepower, including
nuclear weapons. Surely avoiding such a cataclysmic and
probably uncontrollable event is in the interest of everyone,
both the Soviets and the West. But what policy does that
imperative demand?
   Ceaucescu was singularly efficient at suppressing his
ethnic minorities (ask any Hungarian), and at keeping the
rest of his population in terror; his reward was the only
civil war and the only execution in the Eastern European
upheavals. Civil war is most likely to be averted not by
suppression but by accommodation of the Lithuanians, the
Azerbaijanis and the Great Russians in Red Square. They all,
ultimately, have legitimate grievances and legitimate
desires.
   As we argued yesterday, the United States ought to support
a set of Soviet policies that ensures real reform rather than
ties it to one man. Mr. Gorbachev's policy was accommodation
in Eastern Europe, but has turned to suppression elsewhere,
including the blockade of Lithuania and the use of poison gas
and troops in Georgia and deliberately stirring ethnic
animosities in Azerbaijan.
   In Russia, his "reforms" have systematically destroyed
other power structures, including the party, to gather all
power into his personal hands. Andrei Sakharov, in his last
warnings before his death, warned about the dangers of
seeking "democratic change through undemocratic means."
   The most hopeful interpretation of yesterday`s Red Square
events is that Mr. Gorbachev permitted the demonstrations as
a tactic to get back on the path of accommodation and reform.
The test will lie in his treatment of the Lithuanians. But
the West stands warned that Mr. Gorbachev is a variable
partner. The West should support him when he favors reform,
but this does not mean looking the other way when he turns to
repression.

   Meeting of G-7 Leaders Expected to Seek
   End to Delays of IMF Capital Increase

   WASHINGTON -- Financial leaders of the Group of Seven
industrial countries plan to meet here Sunday to try to
resolve complex issues that are holding up a proposed capital
increase for the International Monetary Fund.
   The sticking points include how to deal with countries
that have prolonged overdue payments and how to settle a
dispute between France and Britain about their respective
rankings in the IMF.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's by no means certain that we'll reach an agreement on
the quota this weekend, but I think we will," said a U.S.
Treasury official. He cautioned, however, that "even when
(the G-7) agrees, they may have trouble selling it to the
whole membership" of the IMF.
   The Group of Seven includes the finance ministers and the
central bank presidents of the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada. They are the most powerful
shareholders of the IMF and the World Bank. Their meeting on
Sunday will be followed by the regular semiannual meetings of
the IMF and the World Bank on Monday and Tuesday.
   The G-7 also will discuss international financial
developments, including the continued weakness of the yen.
But in contrast to the group's most recent meeting in Paris,
supporting the yen probably won't be a major focus. Japan's
currency and stock market have recovered some stability.
Moreover, the U.S. Treasury, which plans a refunding of more
than $30 billion in U.S. debt next week, is likely to be
eager for the meeting to avoid major statements on currencies
or interest rates.
   The IMF has sought a 100% increase in member
contributions, or quotas, which total about $120 billion. But
due to opposition from the U.S. and others, the fund probably
will have to settle for half that.
   The U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Britain, which is
currently the IMF's second largest shareholder, insist that
the arrears problem be settled before IMF capital is
increased. But it could take months to sort out the problem,
and that may mean that the capital increase won't take effect
until the end of 1991, officials say.
   As of Jan. 31, $3.4 billion of payments due the IMF were
more than six months overdue; more than $500 million of this
amount was more than three years overdue. Eleven countries
were delinquent. Sudan, Zaire and Peru are among the most
severely indebted to the IMF.
   Recently there has been some progress in working out ways
of dealing with these arrears, a senior monetary official
said this week. Nevertheless, the U.S. is pushing a complex
plan to resolve the problem that would involve changing the
IMF's charter. It would backstop additional bridge loans to
the delinquent countries with gold those same countries have
previously provided the IMF to meet their quotas. The
additional loans would help the countries work out their
arrears, but if they failed to live up to their obligations,
their gold would be sold to make good the IMF's claims
against them.
   The U.S. and 19 other IMF board member countries are
proposing using three million ounces of gold, roughly the
amount of gold the delinquent countries originally deposited
with the IMF. But two other board members -- Japan and West
Germany, who will provide the largest part of the bridge
loans -- want more gold backing.
   Meanwhile, France is asking that it be given an equal rank
in the IMF with Britain. Technically, Britain would have a 6%
share in the fund after the quota increase, and France would
have a 5.1% share, but Paris is asking for parity, with each
country having about 5.4% or 5.5%.
   There is considerable speculation that some arrangement
involving the siting of the new European Bank for
Reconstruction &amp; Development in London may persuade the
British to cut their quota a little.

   House Votes Democratic Spending Plan
   For Fiscal '91 as `First Step' for Budget

   WASHINGTON -- The House voted 218-208 to approve a
Democratic spending plan for fiscal 1991 that Speaker Thomas
Foley described as only "a first step in the process" of
crafting a budget.
   Viewed by House Democrats as little more than their
opening position for talks with the Senate and the White
House, the $1.24 trillion plan managed to attract votes even
from some Democrats who dislike the measure because they
think it cuts too much defense spending and from some who
think it cuts too little. In all, 34 Democrats voted against
the plan, and no Republicans voted for it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an unusual and spirited speech to the House, Speaker
Foley (D., Wash.) exhorted Democrats to support the
leadership's budget to "set forth today the new agenda" and
demonstrate "that we can march, not drift, into the century."
   Ostensibly, the House-backed budget would trim $35.5
billion from the deficit for the fiscal year starting next
Oct. 1. But its chief author, House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), estimates the "hard savings" at no
more than $26 billion or $27 billion. The plan leaves largely
unexplained about $9 billion of the deficit reduction it
assumes.
   Even at face value, the House plan isn't sufficient to
avoid across-the-board budget cuts this fall, White House
Budget Director Richard Darman said. Because of the slowing
economy and higher interest rates, he now estimates that
Congress needs to pare $45 billion or more from the fiscal
1991 deficit to meet the Gramm-Rudman law's target of $64
billion.
   In the Senate, meanwhile, Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser (D., Tenn.) is circulating a new plan among panel
members in his efforts to forge a majority. "We're close . .
. but no cigar," he told reporters. "But we can smell the
aroma of the cigar."
   Although the numbers may change marginally as Sen. Sasser
woos members, those who have seen his plan say it would
shrink the deficit by about $43 billion from projected
levels. It calls for cutting spending of all types more than
in the House plan and for raising $13.9 billion in taxes, the
same as the House budget.
   Specifically, it would cut $13 billion from projected
defense spending, less than the $15 billion Sen. Sasser
endorsed earlier; cut entitlements such as Medicare and farm
subsidies by about $5.6 billion, and cut other domestic
spending by about $3.6 billion. It also would include $6.2
billion in new or increased user fees and other non-tax
receipts.
   Sen. Sasser also is embracing a proposal made by Sen. Kent
Conrad (D., N.D.), a former state tax commissioner, to raise
an additional $11.1 billion for the Treasury by declaring a
tax amnesty of sorts to increase collections of back taxes
and by intensifying Internal Revenue Service enforcement
efforts.
   If the committee can agree on a plan and win approval from
the full Senate, the next step in the budget process is for
the two houses to reconcile their approaches and come up with
a budget resolution to guide appropriations and tax-writing
committees. However, talks with the White House on a
bipartisan compromise could begin before a formal
House-Senate conference is completed.
   The House plan calls for cutting defense spending by $11.5
billion from projected levels and for raising taxes by $13.9
billion, with details dependent on an agreement with the
president. The budget calls for spending more on popular
domestic programs, such as education, than does President
Bush's budget, and it rejects many of the cuts in domestic
spending that Mr. Bush seeks. "We have to establish what
Democrats are all about," Mr. Panetta said.
   In a last-minute change in tactics, Republicans didn't
offer the president's budget for what would have been certain
defeat on the House floor. Speaker Foley called the
unwillingness of a single Republican to formally put the
budget before the House "a quiet, if secret, repudiation of
the president's proposal."
   Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel, senior Republican on the
Budget Committee, replied that the changes in the economy and
world politics have overtaken both the Bush and the
House-backed budget. "Republicans aren't afraid or ashamed of
the Bush budget," he said. But he acknowledged that some
Republicans aren't currently willing to cast votes in favor
of the spending cuts that the president has proposed.
   A spokeswoman for House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R.,
Ill.) defended the GOP decision by noting that Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney's recent comments make clear that
the administration is ready to settle for lower defense
outlays than the $303.3 billion it proposed in January.
   Mr. Foley, who invited the president to submit a revised
budget, said that in the future the president's budget should
automatically come to a vote on the House floor.
   The House vote yesterday came after the House rejected,
334-90, an alternative crafted by the Congressional Black
Caucus that would have cut more from defense, spent more on
domestic programs and raised taxes higher than the
House-passed budget.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- State-owned Petro-Canada Inc., which
the Canadian government plans to privatize, reported 1989 net
income of 31 million Canadian dollars (US$26.6 million),
compared with a restated loss of C$43 million in 1988.
   Operating earnings were C$85 million, compared with a
restated 1988 operating loss of C$11 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The integrated oil and gas concern said the improved
operating results reflect a rebound in its exploration and
production division, where it had a profit of C$80 million
last year, compared with a loss of C$89 million for 1988.
   Earnings from Petro-Canada's marketing and refining
division rose marginally, to C$104 million from C$102
million, it said, while losses from corporate activities
widened to C$99 million from C$24 million, mainly reflecting
higher interest costs.
   Petro-Canada said net in 1989 was affected by a special
charge of C$54 million, stemming from costs associated with
the layoff last year of 905 employees, reducing the company's
staff to about 6,500. In 1988, the company took an
extraordinary charge of C$22 million and paid preferred share
dividends of C$10 million.
   Revenue for 1989 wasn't immediately disclosed;
Petro-Canada had 1988 revenue of C$4.8 billion (US$4.12
billion).
   A change in Petro-Canada's accounting methods, which took
effect Jan. 1, 1989, also made it difficult to compare 1989
results with those of 1988, when the company initially
reported earnings of C$94 million, after special charges and
preferred share dividends totaling C$32 million.

   With the environment now certified as a politically sacred
issue, special interests are using the Clean Air Bill as a
Trojan Horse for some of the most dubious subsidies ever
foisted upon the American people. Richard Ayres, head of the
National Clean Air Coalition, says it was the victim of "a
special-interest feeding frenzy" as Senators vied to insert
favors in late-night voice votes. They range from a national
pollution center in Texas to an acid-rain research project
for Wyoming. But the most egregious is an amendment
co-sponsored by Minority Leader Bob Dole that will require
the use of ethanol fuel in nine cities.
   The farmers who produce ethanol, a corn-distilled alcohol,
are already among the most pampered in America. Ethanol
receives a 60-cent-a-gallon tax credit that is about equal to
the entire refinery cost of a gallon of gasoline. This
program has cost the federal Highway Trust Fund, which is
used to repair bridges and roads, more than $3 billion since
1979.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest ethanol giveaway sets out specific requirements
for all gasoline that will be sold in the nine smoggiest
cities by 1994. Rather than set overall clean-air goals and
let the cities find a way to meet them, the Senate has
dictated the oxygen content and other qualities of the new
fuel. The only fuel that meets the standard is ethanol.
   Iowa Senator Tom Harkin says the provision would cover
about 25% of the nation's drivers, and he boasts that it
"could double the amount of ethanol used." The Congressional
Research Service estimates the extra 10 cents to 15 cents
per-gallon cost of the fuel would cost consumers in the nine
cities $25 billion to $50 billion.
   The irony is that forcing smoggy cities to burn more
ethanol may not improve air quality. Ethanol lowers carbon
monoxide emissions, but the Environmental Protection Agency
reports that it produces more nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbons than normal gasoline. Thus, Wisconsin officials
say mandating ethanol will make it difficult for Milwaukee to
meet federal ozone smog standards.
   The main beneficiary of this windfall will be
Archer-Daniels-Midland Inc., which accounts for 75% of U.S.
ethanol production. For years, ADM has romanced Washington
policy makers through generous contributions and sponsorship
of the Beltway's favorite Sunday-morning political shows. ADM
chief executive Dwayne Andreas is a major contributor to
Senator Dole and ADM's foundation has given $160,000 to his
Dole Foundation. ADM claims it didn't lobby for the ethanol
amendment, but perhaps it didn't have to. Mr. Dole insisted
on it, and the White House withdrew its veto threat in the
face of his support.
   "The piggishness of ADM has caused a major political
problem for the whole corn industry," says John Ford of the
American Corn Growers Association, a group that decries Mr.
Andreas's influence in Washington. "The corn industry, the
politics of it, is controlled by one man, and Bob Dole is his
gofer on the Hill," Mr. Ford told the Kansas City Star.
   The Clean Air Bill is now up for debate in the House,
where Texas Reps. Jack Fields and Ralph Hall plan to
challenge the ethanol subsidy. Their plan would require the
use of alternative fuels in the nine target cities, but lets
engineers and local officials find a way to meet the
standards.
   We've said before that there's a lot more to the politics
of the Clean Air Bill than a desire to improve the
environment. Rather than rely on market-based incentives to
clean up pollution, it uses controls and red tape to reward
some industries and punish others. The bill may ostensibly be
about clean air, but the deals hatched in the smoke-filled
rooms of the Capitol are pure, pork-barrel politics.

   "When the bond market weakened, we hung in there," said
Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody. "The
breadth is a little bit better," he added, noting that
advancing stocks outpaced declining shares, 1,048 to 852.
   However, Mr. Zipper and William Sulya, director of OTC
trading at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, noted that most
of the day's trading was among professional investors hunting
selective bargains.
   Oracle Systems dominated action late in the day after word
spread that the software maker's chief executive officer and
president, Lawrence Ellison, will meet this afternoon with
securities analysts in New York. The day's most active stock,
Oracle dropped 1 1/8 to 14 3/4 on 2.7 million shares, 59%
more turnover than average.
   Analysts, who are divided in guessing what the company
will say, suggested the stock fell amid nervousness about the
meeting. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette software analyst Scott
Smith said in an interview that he expects the Belmont,
Calif., company to report a positive long-term outlook.
Merrill Lynch analyst Stephen T. McClellan said he expects
"some handholding" amid caution the company might not achieve
its short-term objectives.
   MCI Communications led the Nasdaq utility index, which
outpaced other Nasdaq industry groups. The utility index
gained 0.8%, closing up 4.84 at 584.42. Peter Coolidge,
senior OTC trader at Kidder Peabody, said he saw buying of
selective utility shares in the wake of a sell-off in that
group amid fears of higher interest rates.
   MCI Communications, the day's second most active stock,
rose 3/8 to 35 3/8 after announcing it received a $375
million, five-year contract to provide long-distance services
to the Navy Resale and Services Support Office. The contract
is expected to produce $75 million in annual revenue.
   Aspect Telecommunications traded actively after an initial
public offering Monday of two million shares priced at $14.50
each. Shares of the San Jose, Calif., equipment concern
closed unchanged at 15 1/4 on nearly 1.4 million shares.
   Apple Computer added 1/4 to close at 39 5/8 after
unveiling a set of products that links certain Digital
Equipment systems with Apple's Macintosh computers and
AppleTalk networks.
   Merrill Corp. rose 1 1/4 to 8 3/8 after the St. Paul,
Minn., provider of typesetting, distribution and printing
services said it expects to report record revenue and net
income for the fiscal first quarter ended Monday.
   Syncor International advanced 3/8 to 6 7/8 after the Los
Angeles pharmacy service company announced it will buy back
500,000 shares, or 5% of its common stock outstanding.
   Amgen jumped 1 1/2 to 65 1/2 after this newspaper reported
yesterday that the Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology
company won a round in a patent infringement suit involving
Genetics Institute and Japan's Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.
Shares of Genetics Institute of Cambridge, Mass., closed
unchanged at 36 1/4.
   International Game Technology gained 1 5/8 to 34 3/8 on
199,000 shares, more than four times average volume. The
Reno, Nev., maker of casino games reported net income for the
second quarter ended March 31 was 58 cents a share, up from
24 cents a share a year earlier.
   Syntellect added 1 7/8 to close at 19 3/8 after the
company's executive vice president and chief financial
officer, C. Philip Chapman, spoke bullishly about the outlook
for electronic voice processing before a Hambrecht &amp; Quist
technology conference in San Francisco, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. The company went public
in late March at $15 a share.
   FNB Rochester gained 3/4 to close at 11 after announcing
it received an unsolicited acquisition offer. The Rochester,
N.Y., bank holding company declined to identify the suitor
and said no formal agreement had been reached.
   Among the day's losers was System Software, which tumbled
3 1/4 to 20 3/4 after Mr. Smith of Donaldson Lufkin pulled
the Chicago software company from the firm's list of
recommended stocks to buy, according to Professional Investor
Report. Noting the stock has risen 33% since December, Mr.
Smith said he expects the company's business to slow in the
second half of the year.
   Employers Casualty fell 2 3/4 to 7 1/4 after the Dallas
insurance concern said it's omitting a quarterly cash
dividend for June because of poor operating results in the
first quarter. The company last paid a 10-cent dividend in
March. The company reported a first-quarter loss of 91 cents
a share, compared with profit of 55 cents a share a year
earlier.
   Helix Technology lost 1/2 to close at 9 after the Waltham,
Mass., maker of cryogenic refrigeration equipment reported
net income for the first quarter of three cents a share, down
from 37 cents a share the year before. The company also
authorized the purchase of as many as 350,000 of its 2.5
million shares outstanding.

   Slouch and Deliver: The AP Lowers Its Standards

   In "Stand and Deliver," America met Jaime Escalante, the
barrio teacher who bullied, cajoled and inspired his students
to step onto the top rung of academic accomplishment. When
Mr. Escalante's students conquered the Educational Testing
Service's Advanced Placement examination in calculus, America
knew they had reached the highest standard we have for our
high school students. They had done college-level work while
in high school and had that work certified by a national
examination.
   Eat your heart out, Japan] In your face, Western Europe]
These were our kids, and they were top-notch students. The AP
program said so, and AP means high standards, as high as
anyone's.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Or does it? The development committee for the AP Latin
examination has announced that in 1990-91 the AP syllabus in
Vergil's "Aeneid" will be reduced by nearly a third, from
2,649 lines of Latin to 1,842. Students will read the rest of
"The Aeneid" in English translation.
   This is only the most recent in a series of reductions
made over the past two decades. When I started teaching in
1969, the AP Vergil syllabus included 3,166 lines. And in
1964 a fourth-year Latin class at a public high school in
Little Rock, Ark., found it possible -- not easy, but
possible -- to read half "The Aeneid" in Latin. I know,
because I still have the well-marked text I used as a student
in that class.
   Could less be more? Could objections to the reduced
syllabus come from gerund-grinding Latin teachers who think
that the only object of Latin class is a line-by-line forced
march through the text and the production of a translation in
the style of Housman's "Oh suitably attired in leather boots,
head of a traveller?" Have the enlightened examiners now
allowed students time to lift their heads from ground
littered with supines or enclitics and appreciate the
beauties of the Vergilian landscape around them?
   Probably not. The new syllabus distorts as well as
reduces. Anyone who reads half "The Aeneid" in Latin and half
in translation can claim to know what Vergil is like. So,
with somewhat less reason, can someone who has read a third
of the epic in Latin. But students who read the new AP Vergil
syllabus -- less than one-fifth of "The Aeneid" in Latin and
the rest in English -- will have taken a course in translated
literature. They will know something, and something worth
knowing, but they will not have read Vergil in Latin. They
will know about as much about the epic in Latin as a Japanese
would know about Elizabethan drama in English after reading
Tom Stoppard's "Dogg's Hamlet" and a Japanese translation of
Shakespeare's play.
   Unfortunately, the changes in the Vergil examination have
not been made with the intention of improving the AP
syllabus. They have been made in response to a decline in the
standard of work asked of most students in American secondary
and higher education. When the Educational Testing Service
asked colleges about their undergraduate Vergil courses, most
colleges replied that their students did not read anything
like 3,000 lines of Vergil in a semester. Many high schools
reported that the AP Vergil syllabus was impossible to finish
in a year's work.
   Not all high schools find the present standard
unreachable. But now that the AP program no longer requires
students to read as much as they did, the present standard
may become unreachable. Schools have little incentive to ask
their best students to read more than the AP syllabus
requires. The prestige of the AP program guarantees that the
new, dwarf syllabus will come to be regarded as the national
standard of excellence -- at least until even the 1,800-line
syllabus becomes too much for most colleges and schools.
   It would be unfair to blame the Educational Testing
Service for responding to reports that most of its
constituency finds the present AP standard too difficult. The
examiners have simply acted on the results of their marketing
survey.
   But the AP program -- in every subject -- serves American
education by providing one of our only national standards of
excellence. All of us, not just Latin teachers, ought to
become concerned when one of the few markers we have to show
our children the top moves down several notches. We may not
be able to hope that our average students are as good as
those from more homogeneous societies and less egalitarian
educational systems in Europe and Japan, but we have consoled
ourselves with the thought that our best, whether at Andover
or in East L.A., are as good as theirs. One of the standards
by which we measure our best has just been lowered, and all
of us, not merely the students lucky enough to read Vergil in
Latin, stand a little lower.

   Stop Fine-Tuning the Global Economy

   PARIS -- Japan attempted here last month to persuade other
Group of Seven nations to conduct further foreign-exchange
market interventions in support of the yen. It had little or
no success. That's just as well, because past interventions
have been the most important factor in jeopardizing global
monetary and trade adjustment and, consequently, in damaging
U.S.-Japanese relations.
   More broadly, the accumulation by the intervening central
banks of enormous assets in foreign currencies has been,
since the third quarter of 1986, the major source of money
and credit inflation world-wide. Interest rates rose first in
London as the Bank of England tripled its dollar holdings in
1986-87, then later in Frankfurt and ultimately in Tokyo.
(The Bank of Japan had doubled its dollar holdings.) All this
was an indirect consequence of the G-7 Louvre agreement
concluded in February 1987 on the initiative of the U.S. and
France. Rises in interest rates accompanied or followed the
resurgence of inflation. It was plain inflation in Britain,
"asset inflation" (translated primarily to the stock market
and the real estate market) in Japan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To fully appreciate the impact the G-7 approach has on
international affairs, we have to understand why at best only
negligible results in terms of payments and trade balances
can be expected from exchange-rate movements and why
interventions nip in the bud the adjustment process.
Implicitly or explicitly, such policies derive from the basic
concept of "purchasing power parity," a cornerstone of the
classical theory of smooth balance-of-payments adjustment.
This is so even in the frequent (alas) mercantilist efforts
to undervalue currency in order to make sure that foreign
markets will be easily accessible and foreign competitors
kept at bay.
   The reason is simple: How would it be possible to speak
about an "undervalued" rate of exchange if one has not at
least a vague notion of what a correct rate looks like?
Purchasing power parity defines a "right" exchange rate --
that is, the rate at which one dollar (or any other currency)
approximately buys the same amount of goods and services in
the domestic market and abroad after having been exchanged
for the local money.
   What makes the classical theory of a smooth adjustment of
balance of payments so attractive is that it is both sound
and comforting, provided the strict assumptions on which it
is based are not ignored. If, let us say, the dollar is
"overvalued," which means that its current purchasing power
is higher abroad than at home, you can safely expect American
buying of the cheap (for them) goods and services produced
abroad while their own products, by the same token, are
priced out of foreign markets. It is hard to imagine a more
logical way to put a brake on runaway imports and to boost
exports than a change in the external value of the dollar,
back to a level as near as possible to purchasing power
parity.
   But with the current workings of the currency and
financial markets, there is not the slightest chance to see
exchange rates settle to the PPP neighborhood. If the market
rate happens to coincide with PPP (a phenomenon difficult to
measure or even identify), it is mere luck, and such a happy
coincidence never lasts long. Purchasing power parity is not
an operational concept, that is to say it cannot be
artificially promoted. It would be just as naive to think
that central banks could agree to restore PPP through
interventions as to believe that central planning can take
the place of market pricing.
   One can be tempted to object that the European Monetary
System experience somewhat contradicts this point. Within the
EMS, manifest undervaluation or overvaluation of currencies
would not be tolerated and it is a fact that so far,
collectively agreed-upon collective actions have always very
rapidly been taken to prevent such phenomena from happening.
Should not, consequently, the EMS experience be alleged as an
evidence that the so-to-speak managed PPP is possible?
   But this interpretation would miss the essential point.
According to EMS rules, a central bank (the currency of which
has to be supported by other EMS central banks) has to repay
the whole amount of the credit granted by the latter within
six months at the latest. So the adjustment process can
operate the way a classical model works. It is not so with
the international monetary system. In the international
monetary system, accumulation of dollar-denominated reserves
by non-American central banks means that the latter are
extending permanent credit to the U.S.
   At best, PPP is useful as a concept in understanding what
a market equilibrium might be like in a free-trade world
immune to distortions through monetary interferences. Look at
the confusion that reigns around the notion: Martin Feldstein
thinks that parity would hold at a yen value of 120 to the
dollar or below while Goldman Sachs International sets the
rate at 209 yen to the dollar. But even if experts could
agree on the supposedly "right" figures, central banks
through interventions would immediately distort the price
relationships.
   The reason for this can be found in an article published
by Jacques Rueff in 1922 -- a year of turbulent markets for
currencies -- that defined the strict limits within which the
PPP principle applies. He wrote that the exchange rate
between the currency of country A and the currency of country
B will gravitate toward the parity of their respective
purchasing powers only if the following condition is
satisfied: that those countries confine their respective
money issuance to discounting papers originated in economic
(production, trade, etc.) transactions.
   To gauge how far we stand from the theoretical world
referred to by Rueff, consider the way the various national
banking systems are operating today. Some countries have
effectively and reasonably abided by that rule (government
debt ultimately financed by non-financial investors, thus
excluding any monetization). West Germany and Japan are by
all accounts (with a few smaller nations) the most prominent
examples.
   But look at what happened: By the very effect of their
relatively sound monetary and financial management, the
currencies of those countries have at times appreciated with
such a vigor that it was judged necessary by the G-7 to mount
massive rescue operations for the dollar in Frankfurt and
Tokyo. The consequence of those huge interventions was to
fill the Bank of Japan, the Bundesbank, the Taiwan central
bank and others with huge holdings of dollars, which were
immediately invested in U.S. T-bills and T-bonds. What does
that mean in terms of issuance of money?
   It means that, through interventions in the exchange
markets, the monetization of U.S. government debt by
non-American central banks in recent years has been by far
the biggest source of money creation outside the U.S.
Whenever it buys dollars, the Bank of Japan issues yen, the
Bank of England issues sterling, etc.
   From the end of 1986 to the end of 1988, the net increase
of dollar-denominated holdings by European and Asian central
banks amounted to between $135 billion and $150 billion, a
formidable figure that is more than half of the total of U.S.
Federal Reserve credit. That means that the socalled
"stabilization" of the dollar, as symbolized by the Louvre
agreement, boiled down to the distribution all around the
world of a capacity to create money and credit equal to more
than half the capacity of the Fed itself.
   For the past 18 months or so, most interventions have
aimed at supporting the mark and more recently the yen.
Consequently, the mark "reserve" held by central banks
(especially the U.S. Fed) has rapidly increased, and likewise
for yen holdings. The monetary base of the world -- and
foremost the U.S. monetary base -- has expanded
commensurately.
   Central banks (with the notable exceptions of the most
anti-inflationary ones, such as the Bundesbank, the Bank of
Japan, the National Bank of Switzerland and the National Bank
of Netherlands) would argue that they can "sterilize" the
reserves so acquired. But it is not so. When a central bank
is buying foreign currencies, its interventions in the
currencies market compare with the European Community
agricultural agency acquiring all the surplus wheat offered
at the market and not demanded at the Community-set price.
The support mechanism distorts the prices of monetary claims
as surely as it distorts the prices of commodities.
   But there is something still more disturbing. The only way
for a central bank to "sterilize" newly acquired foreign
assets is to sell a corresponding amount of domestic assets
in the open market. By doing so, it raises domestic interest
rates. Remember that at the moment the G-7 was urging
European and Asian central banks to support the dollar under
the Louvre agreement the same G-7 was urging the Bank of
Japan and the Bundesbank to lower domestic rates. Such
contradictions cast doubt on the entire G-7 "global
adjustment process."

   Japan's Insider-Trading Law,
   Put to Test, Looks Soft as Sushi

   TOKYO -- A year after authoring a new insider-trading law,
embarrassed Japanese stock-market regulators are watching
with their hands tied as police pursue the country's first
criminal insider-trading investigation.
   The regulators fear that the case, which centers on the
stock-trading activities of a woman and the former president
of Chiyoda Finance Co., makes the new insider-trading law
look toothless. Coming on the heels of Michael R. Milken's
admission of guilt to securities-law violations in Wall
Street's biggest criminal insider-trading case, the
difficulty that Japanese regulators have experienced in
pursuing their own investigation under the new law
particularly rankles some officials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I wish we could have as much power as" the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, says an official at the
Finance Ministry, one of the agencies charged with
investigating improper share dealings. The SEC has a large
staff of investigators and lawyers who are empowered to
subpoena information and witnesses.
   By contrast, the Finance Ministry relies on informal, not
legal, influence and is short on staff: The number of
officials who conduct such inquiries soon will rise to 17
from seven at present. The ministry usually must rely on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's surveillance department to help.
   But both the ministry and the exchange came up
empty-handed when they began inquiries into the current case,
the first possible violation of last year's insider-trading
law. They lack the power to demand access to evidence or
compel witnesses to testify.
   As a result, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department --
acting on its own initiative -- took up the insider-trading
case and now appears close to beginning Japan's first
insider-trading prosecution. That turn of events is
embarrassing for market regulators, who pride themselves on
their close attention to the market and who last April
proudly implemented the legislation designed to make insider
trading illegal in Japan for the first time.
   A police spokesman confirmed that an investigation is
under way but would give no details. He declined to say how
the investigation was begun. No charges have been filed, he
said.
   However, Finance Ministry officials said, and Japanese
newspapers have reported, that the inquiry is focused on the
stock-market activities of a woman who the officials identify
as the girlfriend of a former president of Chiyoda, a small
Japanese finance company. The president, officials say, had
advance knowledge that a small Japanese company, Nisshin
Kisen Co., planned to issue new stock in order to fund the
purchase of a hotel in Australia. Nisshin Kisen is also known
as Nisshin Steamship Co., the English translation of the
Japanese name.
   The finance company's president -- who resigned March 31,
citing health reasons -- was told by Nisshin officials of
Nisshin's plans on June 8. Before the issue was announced,
the financier, apparently through his woman friend's account,
bought 7,000 shares in Nisshin, investigators believe. A day
before the stock issue was announced on June 16, Nisshin's
share price rose 160 yen ($1.01) to 2,210 yen, and its
trading volume more than tripled from average levels. Chiyoda
holds Nisshin Kisen shares.
   Nisshin Kisen confirmed that an investigation of the stock
trading is under way, but it declined any additional comment.
Chiyoda Finance declined comment on the case, although its
spokesman pointed out that the official under investigation
has resigned. The former president, meanwhile, could not be
contacted.
   The activity surrounding Nisshin's stock in advance of the
announcement prompted the Finance Ministry and the Tokyo
exchange to begin inquiries last June. But neither agency was
able to come up with anything to suggest that anyone had
relied on advance knowledge of the stock issue to make a
profit. The main reason for their failure, officials
complain, was their inability to demand assistance in their
inquiries from brokerage houses.
   "It would have been impossible" for the Finance Ministry
to know about any impropriety, because it lacks the legal
power to force clients to disclose the details of their
transactions, says Katsuzo Wakabayashi, a director in the
ministry's securities bureau. "We don't have the right to
search" for records as the Japanese police do, he says.
   The president of the stock exchange also bemoans the lack
of policing authority. "There is a limit in our investigating
ability," concedes Minoru Nagaoka, the president. But he says
the exchange can monitor trading and try to discourage
improper activity. "We want to exert more efforts to
strengthen our trading-screening function," he says.
   As a result, some officials complain that the
insider-trading law -- implemented last April at the height
of a national stock scandal that eventually felled the
government of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita -- has done
little to improve regulators' control over improper activity
in the markets.
   So far, though, nobody is calling for a revision of the
law. One Finance Ministry official says market regulators
simply will have to rely more on and cooperate more with the
police. "Of course we are willing to use them," he says.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida Federal Savings Bank was
convicted by a federal jury of falsifying statements in
connection with government-backed student loans.
   In early 1988, Florida Federal came under scrutiny for
allegedly filing as many as 17,000 fraudulent insurance
claims on $35 million dollars in student loans. The
investigation helped trigger a management shake-up that
included the resignation of Florida Federal's chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The federal jury in Tampa found the company guilty of 43
counts of falsifying statements between November 1986 and
July 1987. Sentencing is set for June 27. Florida Federal
faces a possible fine of $21.5 million and restitution of $18
million.
   Two former officers of the company -- Robert O. Harmas, 42
years old, of Noblesville, Ind.; and James J. LaMantia, 59,
of Largo, Fla. -- were also convicted of falsifying
statements. Neither could be reached for comment.
   The thrift's chief executive officer, John W. Sapanski,
said in a prepared statement: "We are disappointed in the
verdict. However, resolution of the student loan problem has
always been the new management's primary objective, so that
we can proceed with implementing a plan to meet {federal}
capital requirements. The conclusion of the trial and the
sentencing will represent significant steps toward resolution
of the problem."

   Burger King, in Big Blow to Pepsi, Is Switching to Coke

<LP>
   In a major coup, Coca-Cola Co. swiped Pepsi-Cola Co.'s
biggest fountain customer, the No. 2 fast-food chain, Burger
King Corp.
   In an industry where executives like to characterize
market-share battles as "one drink at a time," Coke is taking
a big gulp. Burger King, with 5,400 restaurants in the U.S.,
represents at least $270 million in lost business annually
for Pepsi, according to Jesse Meyers, publisher of trade
newsletter Beverage Digest. Coke will now have a lock on the
nation's two largest fast-food chains, Burger King and
top-ranked McDonald's Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even more important, Mr. Meyers estimates, Burger King
accounts for about 18% of Pepsi's fountain business, which
was already far overshadowed by Coke's. Pepsi's next three
biggest customers are chains owned by its parent PepsiCo
Inc.: Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   It's that troika, the largest collection of restaurants in
the country, that industry executives believe ultimately led
Burger King to dump Pepsi. In recent years, Atlanta-based
Coke has hammered away at its central argument that fast-food
chains shouldn't use Pepsi at their fountain spigots because
that, in effect, supports a competitor. In a swipe at Pepsi,
a Coke sales brochure for restaurant managers asks: "Is your
soft-drink supplier satisfying your customers' hunger instead
of their thirst?"
   For its part, Burger King considers Pepsi's ownership of
rival chains only one factor in its decision to switch, says
a spokeswoman for the Miami-based chain, which was acquired
by London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC in January 1989. "We
looked at the whole package that Coca-Cola offered," she
says.
   The five-year deal includes a price discount -- Burger
King calls it a volume incentive program -- that "rewards
incremental volumes of syrup gallons sold over a base level."
Figures weren't disclosed. The Burger King spokeswoman
wouldn't say whether Pepsi had had a similar plan. The
agreement also includes a commitment by Coke to work on what
the chain called a state-of-the-art dispensing system to
which Burger King would eventually convert. Moreover, in what
could be a multimillion-dollar boon for Burger King, Coke
will contribute to the chain's cooperative advertising and
marketing effort.
   Burger King, which already serves Coke products overseas,
switched to Pepsi from Coke six years ago. But as part of
"vendor reviews" ordered by the chain's new management,
Burger King officials approached both soft-drink companies
earlier this year looking for a better deal. "We asked them
to submit a proposal on what they could offer us for the
1990s," the spokeswoman says.
   The loss of Burger King is a major blow to Pepsi's image
and the second such loss this year. Wendy's International
Inc., which had been involved in a lengthy legal dispute with
Pepsi over Wendy's soft-drink contract, said it plans to put
Coke in its company-owned restaurants when its Pepsi contract
expires at year end.
   With the loss of Burger King, Pepsi's share in the
soft-drink fountain market drops to about 21% from more than
26%, according to Beverage Digest. Coke's share rises to 65%
from about 60%.
   "For Pepsi, this is a big morale loss, as well as a
revenue loss," says Leenie Ruben, president of Marketing
Spectrum Inc., a market research company. "Coke will really
be controlling the fountain business with the two largest
chains."
   A Pepsi spokesman downplayed the loss. "It was not
unexpected, given the management changes that Burger King has
been going through," he said. He estimated that Burger King
accounted for about 2.4% of Pepsi's U.S. soft-drink volume
and "nominal" profit.
   Coke is getting Burger King's business at a fortuitous
time. Sales at the fast-food chain are rebounding. Moreover,
Coke's fountain business, which accounts for about one-third
of its domestic sales, has been sluggish as a result of
softness in the restaurant industry.
   The switch to Coke from Pepsi, which is based in Purchase,
N.Y., will begin in about 30 days. It may not be completed
before the summer in what Burger King said would be a
region-by-region conversion. The spokeswoman wouldn't
disclose how the chain would announce its change in soft
drinks to customers.
   Pepsi's contract with Burger King included a 60-day
cancellation clause, which Burger King said it exercised
yesterday.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Pepsi shares fell 50 cents to close at $65.75, and Coke
shares rose 50 cents to close at $76.75.

   WASHINGTON -- The Air Transport Association, a U.S.

million for information that helps authorities thwart
terrorism directed at airlines.
   The $1 million bounty will be used to supplement the State
Department's offer of as much as $2 million for such
information in cases of airline terrorism overseas. Unlike
the State Department's program, the ATA's offer will apply to
information related to domestic cases as well.

   "It was the unanimous judgment that the combined reward of
$3 million . . . is a meaningful amount in terms of providing
a deterrent, a disincentive or an encouragement to someone to
come forward with the information," said Robert Aaronson,
ATA's president. Twenty-three airlines will contribute money
to the reward pool.
   William Baker, assistant director of the
criminal-investigation division of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, said nearly 800 people have been murdered by
terrorist bombs on airlines.

   Gasoline Prices Resist Crude Behavior

<LP>
   With crude oil prices off more than 20%, can lower
gasoline prices be far behind?
   The answer is, yes. Very far behind.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Prices should be going down, there's no question about
it," says Jerry Ferrara, executive director of the New Jersey
Gasoline Retailers Association, which represents about 3,000
service stations. But they aren't. And probably won't be.
   Domestic crude that cost refiners more than $23 a barrel
in late January now costs only about $18.50 a barrel -- and
has been as cheap as $16.50 -- but the price of gasoline has
been as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar.
   American motorists at the end of April were paying an
average of $1.01 a gallon for regular unleaded, according to
Computer Petroleum Corp., a St. Paul, Minn., tracker of
prices at 7,000 stations. That's off a scant 1% from the
nationwide average of $1.02 a gallon in January.
   What gives? Gas station owners say the oil companies are
trying to get richer by simply pocketing the reduction in raw
material costs. Not so, say several major oil companies,
which claim that other costs are eating up what might appear
to be a windfall.
   "I've been in this business long enough to know that the
reason (behind price moves) isn't always economics," says Jim
Boyajian, a fuel transportation manager for Amoco Corp. in
Chicago. Right now, he says, market psychology, seasonal
demands and new environmental costs are disrupting the
seemingly simple relationship between crude oil prices and
gasoline prices.
   Some in the industry wonder if gas stations aren't banking
a few extra cents themselves. "Any retailer will raise prices
as fast as he can and hold off as long as he can before he
lowers them," says McDonald Beavers, president of Whitney
Leigh Corp., a Tulsa, Okla., firm that monitors the gasoline
business.
   Whatever the cause, motorists have been paying summer
gasoline prices through the winter, and now, with spring at
hand, are facing more summer prices.
   The specter of finger-pointing motorists makes the pricing
issue a sensitive one at all levels of the oil industry.
Officials of Shell Oil Co., the nation's biggest seller of
gasoline, declined to be interviewed on the subject. Instead,
the company delivered a one-page discourse entitled "Why
Gasoline Prices Don't Track Crude Oil Prices." (It gently
chides "consumers and reporters" for expecting "an immediate
decrease in gasoline prices.")
   But the big oil companies -- including Shell -- concede
that over the long haul the price of gasoline really is
supposed to track the cost of crude, its main component. It's
just that sometimes there's a lag, they say. When a company
buys a $23 barrel of oil in the U.S., it may be one to three
months before that oil is refined and sold somewhere, oil
officials say. The lag can be double that if the barrel comes
from the Middle East.
   By then, the price of a new barrel of crude may have
fallen, but the cost of the old barrel was incurred and still
needs to be recovered, they explain.
   That explains most of the winter -- motorists were still
buying gasoline made with pricey crude. But then why didn't
prices fall with spring, reflecting the decline in crude
prices that had been in progress for a while?
   Blame the law of supply and demand. The oil industry was
doing a little spring cleaning. Parts of many refineries were
shut down for periodic maintenance that curbed the amount of
gasoline they produced, explains a spokesman for Conoco Inc.
in Houston, a unit of Du Pont Co. While those cutbacks
temporarily added to the world oil glut and helped further
drive down crude prices, it also created some tightness in
gasoline supplies that kept pump prices up.
   Now the maintenance work is mostly done, oil experts say.
But, alas, it is too late for a gasoline price decline.
Demand -- and prices -- are being buoyed because "we're
entering the historic beginning of the driving season," says
the Conoco spokesman.
   In addition, new and wider application of environmental
rules this year require less volatile summer gasoline, and
that is more expensive to refine, oil companies say. "We've
got some costs we're trying to recover as good businessmen,"
says Amoco's Mr. Boyajian.
   In fact, some people say consumers should feel lucky.
"Gasoline prices should have been much higher in the first
quarter, based on the cost of crude," argues Bernard Picchi,
an oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Besides, oil companies note, they aren't the only ones who
influence what motorists pay. Though they aren't anxious to
start a squabble with the service station operators who buy
their product, they point out that final pump prices are
determined at the street corner, not the refinery.
   "The dealer out there is going to get as much margin as he
can," says Bill Hermann, chief economist in San Francisco for
Chevron Corp. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't."
   Mostly it doesn't, say gas station owners. "I wish my
dealers were smart enough to grab something of their own, but
they're not," says Mr. Ferrara, head of the New Jersey
retailers group. And anyway, he counters, the price his
dealers pay for regular unleaded has been -- give or take a
penny -- about 90 cents a gallon all year.

   TORONTO -- Christopher Ondaatje, chairman of Pagurian
Corp. and vice chairman of Hees International Bancorp,
resigned from the boards of both companies.
   A Hees executive said the merchant banking concern, which
is indirectly controlled by Toronto financiers Peter and
Edward Bronfman, is in the early stages of finding
replacements for Mr. Ondaatje on the boards.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Ondaatje created Pagurian as a book publishing concern
in 1967 and expanded it into an investment holding company
with interests in Canada and overseas. In December 1988, Mr.
Ondaatje sold control of Pagurian to Hees in exchange for
Hees common shares. He was named Hees vice-chairman at that
time.
   Mr. Ondaatje, 57 years old, said he is stepping down from
the Pagurian and Hees boards because "it is time that I did
something else." He plans to become more actively involved in
publishing in Canada and less so in the financial services
sector.
   He said his principal task since selling control of
Pagurian has been to gradually hand over management of
Pagurian to executives of Hees, Brascan Ltd. and Edper
Enterprises Ltd. Brascan is a resource concern controlled by
the Bronfmans through Edper.
   Mr. Ondaatje said he currently holds five million Pagurian
shares and 1.5 million Hees shares. At last report, Pagurian
had shares outstanding of about 84.9 million, and Hees had
roughly 79.3 million.
   Mr. Ondaatje didn't elaborate on his plans in publishing,
but he said he was "very disappointed" by the sale last
December of the Financial Times of Canada by Southam Inc. to
Thomson Corp. Mr. Ondaatje had expressed an interest in
buying the weekly financial newspaper.

   BUDAPEST -- Although the first freely elected parliament
in 43 years convenes here today, there seems to be little
enthusiasm for this long-awaited moment. Perhaps spirits were
deflated by the strains of the election campaign. Members of
the winning Hungarian Democratic Forum and of the runner-up
Alliance of Free Democrats exchanged accusations that the
other party was not completely free of the stain of
communism. The HDF was equated with "laces and ribbons"
patriotism, while less-than-artful allusions were made to the
concentration of Jewish intellectuals among the Free
Democrats.
   Since the election, Jozsef Antall, the
prime-minister-in-waiting, has promised to put "the
resentments and affronts accumulated during the campaign
behind us." The Free Democrats too are calling for
"constructive cooperation."

   With seating arrangements ironed out (the ex-communist
"Socialists" refused the seats offered them on the far left
wing of the parliamentary chamber), the new parliament can
get down to real business: setting up the standing and
special committees; voting themselves respectable salaries;
and holding hearings on the new cabinet, which should be
presented in a few days.
   The main procedural issue will be to decide which laws
will need a two-thirds majority-which the governing coalition
of the HDF, the agrarian Smallholders and the Christian
Democrats do not have. All parties agree in principle that
laws of constitutional significance -- such as the laws
expected on the decentralization of government, the
declaration of states of emergency and the ordering of closed
sessions of parliament -- should require the assent of
two-thirds of the elected deputies.
   It makes less sense, however, for laws on tax regulations
to continue to require such a margin. The governing parties
may well decide to cede some key parliamentary posts to the
opposition in return for a curtailing of the two-thirds rule.
The dilemma is that if law making procedures become too
restrictive and inflexible, economic restructuring could get
bogged down; if, though, the coalition gains an unrestrained
hand over legislation, a suspicion of statism may continue to
linger over the country.
   Among the more complex issues is agrarian land reform,
which was thrust into the fore by the Smallholders, who
gained prominence in the closing weeks of the campaign by
proposing to restore the 1947 farmland ownership status. The
Smallholders' Ferenc Nagy says that his party will insist on
the return of the land or on appropriate compensation if the
former owner no longer wants to work the property. He
concedes that because of a shortage of funds a moratorium on
the payments may be necessary at the outset. Mr. Nagy, an
agricultural engineer whose once prosperous family was
pauperized by the communists and whom local party bosses
hounded from his job as president of a collective in
Kisharsany near the Yugoslav border, says that "the
constitutionality of the nation" cannot be established
without "clarifying these property rights."
   Mr. Antall agrees in priniciple, noting that it was the
peasantry which "has suffered the most." But he sees
complications stemming from postwar population transfers,
voluntary property sales and value changes due to land
development. A compromise such as "long-term reparations"
might be necessary for those who moved away, while people who
never owned land but worked in a collective farm all these
years "would have to be given a preference to buy."
   The Free Democrats dislike both approaches. Ferenc Koszeg,
who edits a political weekly that has emerged from its
formerly underground status and who is a new member of
parliament, sees no reason to grant ownership to anyone --
former owner or long-time employee. "Everyone suffered -- not
only 20% of the population," he says. "The suggestion that
rent is now due to the descendant of a former owner would be
a liability for everyone in the country -- in the form of
higher prices." Mr. Koszeg says farmland should be privatized
the way apartment buildings, manufacturing facilities and
hotels should beby ending subsidies and allowing markets to
develop so prospective buyers can make bids.
   Whether such radically different approaches can be merged
into something coherent is crucial not only to Hungary's
future, but could serve as a guide for other Eastern European
states and to certain areas of the Soviet Union itself.
Export capability will become increasingly important as the
food-for-fuel bartering cartel of Comecon disintegrates. In
Hungary, 70% of the land is suitable for some agricultural
activity, while 50% is arable -- well above the world average
of about 10%. That is why, Mr. Nagy says, the communist
conceit about heavy industry was particularly disastrous for
Hungary.
   Foreign policy is another area about which the Hungarian
parties don't see eye-to-eye. A statement announcing an
intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact is recommended by
the Free Democrats. "Hungary should initiate talks
independent of other Warsaw Pact members," Mr. Koszeg says.
The HDF's official position is for more restraint and
coordination with other Warsaw Pact members. The HDF thinks
that the pact is not so menacing any more and may even offer
protection from potentially hostile neighbors such as
Romania.
   Mr. Antall is not eager to provoke Mikhail Gorbachev, but
he says that HDF "supports Lithuania fully," and finds
nothing objectionable about German unification within the
framework of "European political and economic integration. We
don't see a conflict between that and the Atlantic idea. We
support American presence -- military presence -- in Europe."
   Mr. Antall, a historian, feels that "Britain, the U.S. and
in part France, because of their overseas interests in the
past decades and past century, neglected this continent. In
the past century this was understandable in the era of
colonization. But in the 20th century they should have
recognized that the real nerve center of the world is middle
Europe, where global scale power questions are decided
without fail. They allowed Middle Europe to slip under
Hitlerism, and from Hitlerism directly into Stalinism." Mr.
Antall hopes that the circle now can be broken once and for
all.

   TOKYO -- Vigorous domestic demand and eased restrictions
combined to push Japan's 1989 food imports up to $32.6
billion, a 5.4% rise from a year earlier, the Japan External
Trade Organization, a quasi-governmental promotion agency,
said.
   The increase was in line with an upward trend that began
at least five years ago. Though the yen declined in foreign
exchange markets, especially in the 1989 second half, and
made imports more expensive, robust domestic demand such as
personal consumption and less stringent regulations resulted
in the food import rise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Shrimp imports again topped the list, totaling $2.59
billion, followed by corn, $2.26 billion; beef, $1.65
billion; and pork, $1.63 billion. Imports of processed foods,
including alcoholic beverages such as whisky and brandy, also
showed conspicuous gains as a result of changes in the
country's liquor taxes.
   Food imports from the U.S. totaled a record $10.27
billion, exceeding the $10 billion level for the first time,
from $9.7 billion a year earlier. The U.S. accounted for 32%
of Japan's overall food imports last year. Beef imports from
the U.S. jumped 38% to $880 million, and accounted for 53% of
Japan's total 1989 beef imports.

   American Express `Portraits' Hit Europe

   American Express Co. plans to extend its "Portraits" print
ad campaign featuring celebrity card holders to a number of
European countries.
   Like the U.S. campaign that features American celebrities
such as Ella Fitzgerald and Neil Simon, the European ads will
be tailored to spotlight famous personalities of particular
countries. An ad for Germany, for example, features Alfred
Biolek, a prominent journalist and talk-show host there.
"American Express Mitglied seit {card member since} 1980,"
the ad says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   American Express is rolling out the campaign in Europe as
part of a broader effort to beef up its card holder ranks
overseas. "All of our efforts are aimed at building an
upscale position with the people in the market," says Rick
Thoman, president and chief executive officer at American
Express International. "Our goal is to own the upscale
franchises."
   But in its bid to build the business outside the U.S.,
American Express faces a formidable challenge. The concept of
credit is still a relatively foreign idea to many Europeans.
Though Americans spend well over 10% of their income with
credit cards, many Europeans live in countries where
consumers spend only 2% or 3% of their incomes with charge
cards. Italians spend just 1.5% of their incomes with charge
cards, the lowest percentage in Western Europe.
   "Cash is the enemy," admits Mr. Thoman. But he says
attitudes overseas toward credit are changing. American
Express estimates world-wide spending on plastic will balloon
to about $3.5 trillion a year over the next decade from $800
million, with the bulk of that increase coming overseas.
   American Express hopes the customized "Portraits" ads,
along with targeted television campaigns, will encourage
Europeans to apply for its card. The company has raised ad
spending overseas significantly, and Mr. Thoman says spending
outside the U.S. now accounts for about 40% to 45% of its
total ad budget, up from only 15% a few years ago. According
to Advertising Age, American Express spent a total of $247.2
million on advertising in 1988.
   In the U.S., creative teams at Ogilvy &amp; Mather, a unit of
WPP Group, work with American Express executives to develop
"wish lists" of celebrities they would like to feature in the
campaign. Mr. Thoman says Ogilvy teams in foreign countries
are working much the same way, identifying candidates in
sports, entertainment and politics.
   American Express won't name all of the European
celebrities that have been chosen for the campaign. It says,
however, that the campaign for France will include Michel
Serrault, a French actor, and Christian LaCroix, the clothing
designer. The campaign in Germany, which has just begun
running, includes portraits of Alwin Schockemoehle, an
equestrian gold medalist, and Bernhard Langer, a German
golfer.
   Although the U.S. campaign has succeeded in large part
because it appeals to Americans' thirst for pictures of the
famous, American Express and Ogilvy say the interest isn't
only an American phenomenon.
   "We've found that the campaign has an ability to translate
fairly immediately almost anywhere," says Gordon Bowen,
senior vice president and creative director at Ogilvy.
   All the photos in the international campaign, like those
in the U.S., were shot by Annie Leibovitz, a celebrity
photographer. American Express says the introduction of the
campaign in some instances has been delayed because of Ms.
Leibovitz's schedule. The firm says it decided that using a
separate photographer overseas would disrupt the continuity
of the campaign.
   Ms. Leibovitz just finished shooting in France, and other
photo sessions are on deck for Italy, Spain, Belgium and
Switzerland, among others. The campaign is already running in
the Far East and Asia.
   Although most stars in the campaigns for countries outside
of the U.S. won't be recognized by Americans, some of the ads
will run in more than one country. "There are a number of
portraits that have relevance across a number of markets,"
Mr. Thoman says. A portrait featuring classical musician Yo
Yo Ma, which was originally created for the U.S., recently
ran in Hong Kong.

   Breene Is Leaving
                                                                                                       

   Tim Breene, chief executive officer of Della Femina
McNamee WCRS's parent company, is stepping down as a result
of the company's elimination of its London co-headquarters.
   The parent company, Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball, had
split its headquarters between London and Paris, but will
consolidate in Paris. Eurocom WCRS, which itself is 60%-owned
by France's Eurocom ad agency, was formed last year when
London-based WCRS sold its advertising business to Eurocom.
   Mr. Breene had been deputy chairman of WCRS. He will stay
on briefly as a consultant to help with the transition and to
develop below-the-line, nonadvertising marketing services,
said Louise McNamee, president of Della Femina McNamee.
   Mr. Breene will be succeeded by Pierre DePlais, who will
also remain chief operating officer of Eurocom in Paris.
Working with Mr. DePlais will be Jean de Yturbe, who had been
chief executive of ad agency HDM's European operations.

   Economy:
   Manufacturing Sector Expanded in April
   ---
   Purchasing Agents Say Rise
   Was First in 11 Months;
   Building Outlays Decline

   WASHINGTON -- The manufacturing sector of the economy
showed signs of expanding in April for the first time in 11
months, according to a survey of purchasing managers across
the country.
   An index compiled by the National Association of
Purchasing Management rose to 50.2% last month from 48.8% in
March. The association says a reading above 50% signals the
manufacturing economy is generally growing. Every monthly
reading since May 1989 has been below that threshold.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the index is based simply on survey responses from
purchasing executives in about 300 companies, the financial
markets watch it closely because it is usually the first
measure of economic activity for any month.
   The Commerce Department also said that spending on
construction projects fell 1.4% in March, the first decline
this year and the biggest drop since February 1989.
   The decline followed hefty rises of 3.2% in February and
2.4% in January. The weather was unseasonably warm in those
months, leading many builders to step up work on projects.
March weather, on the other hand, was normal for the month.
   Both manufacturing and construction have been hurt by the
Federal Reserve's efforts to slow the economy and battle
inflation by maintaining high interest rates.
   But according to the purchasing managers surveyed in
April, production and new domestic and export orders all
increased during the month. However, they said, employment
continued to decline, suggesting that softness persists in a
number of industries.
   "The manufacturing economy inched into expansion territory
as it entered the second quarter," said the association's
chairman, Robert J. Bretz, director of materials management
at Pitney Bowes Inc.
   Many economists think manufacturing is beginning to
scramble out of its slump of the past year, though they
believe it will continue to be weak for some time. On Monday
Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, told a
convention of the purchasing managers association in New
Orleans that "risks of a sharp or prolonged decline in
manufacturing output clearly have abated since last autumn."
   But the government has issued some disturbing figures on
inflation recently. And in the purchasing managers survey,
for the first time since May 1989 more purchasing executives
said their prices were higher than lower. As a result of
inflation worries, some analysts speculate the Fed will
consider pushing up interest rates in the near future. In any
case, it's highly doubtful that interest rates will fall any
time soon, and that will likely prevent a hearty rebound in
manufacturing.
   Despite the overall decline in construction spending,
outlays for private residential construction, the largest
part of the building market, grew 1.8% to a $203.2 billion
annual rate in March. That followed a 1.5% increase in
February.
   Spending on industrial, business and other private
nonresidential construction tumbled 4.7% in March, to $101.1
billion rate, after posting a 5.8% gain in February. Outlays
for public construction projects dropped 4.8%, to a $90.7
billion rate, after rising 5% in February.
   Overall construction spending in March ran at a $432.5
billion rate, down from a $438.6 billion rate in February.
   Both reports are adjusted for seasonal variations.

telecommunications companies out of nearly $600,000 as the
head of a nationwide computer-hacking ring.
   Leslie Lynne Doucette, 36 years old, working with 152
alleged co-schemers, fraudulently obtained 481 telephone
credit-card codes, according to the plea agreement, and then
published them in voice-mail systems that were accessed by
other hackers. The scheme was discovered when a suburban
Chicago real-estate brokerage complained that its voice-mail
system had been invaded by the hackers, who had changed the
system's passwords.

   Federal prosecutors charged Ms. Doucette last year in the
scheme, which according to the indictment resulted in a loss
of $1.6 million of telephone and computer services from the

   The one count to which Ms. Doucette eventually pleaded
guilty carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison, and
a $1 million fine.

   Cheney Extends
   Funds Moratorium
   On Building Bases

   WASHINGTON -- Stepping up pressure on Congress to close
military facilities, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney extended a
spending moratorium on base construction and listed 207
additional projects around the world as possible candidates
for cancellation.
   By expanding the range of potential cutbacks, Mr. Cheney
hopes to increase his leverage in a battle with lawmakers
over how deeply and where to cut Pentagon spending. With his
additional targets which include possible closure of some
military bases he hadn't cited previously, Mr. Cheney has now
targeted construction projects with an estimated value of
more than $7 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest proposed "hit list" includes controversial
naval "home ports" slated for Texas, New York and other
states, along with big-ticket items that would mean
substantial jobs and income to dozens of other communities
around the U.S. Some of the projects were authorized by
Congress as long as five years ago, but Mr. Cheney has
ordered them to be re-examined in light of today's budget
pressures and changes in East-West relations.
   At a news conference, Mr. Cheney accused his congressional
critics of "a certain amount of hypocrisy." Some lawmakers
complain loudly about the need for deeper cuts "even as they
plead to save the projects in their own states and
districts," the defense chief asserted.
   When budget cuts threaten to force "dedicated soldiers to
turn in their uniforms and leave the service," he added, "I
cannot put construction projects ahead of people."
   Mr. Cheney's world-wide freeze on signing new military
construction contracts, originally scheduled to end
yesterday, now will remain in effect until June 15. The
secretary previously proposed possible closing of more than
50 bases around the world; Pentagon officials didn't specify
how many more bases could face the same fate in the wake of
his announcement.
   Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood was ordered to
conduct the high-level review of the construction projects
left in limbo. The largest number of projects are in West
Germany; they include construction or upgrading of hangars,
maintenance facilities, housing projects, medical facilities
and schools serving military families.
   Although there are some U.S. facilities among Mr. Cheney's
latest target list, most of the cuts would involve overseas
projects. Targeting overseas bases is certain to provoke less
of a fuss in Congress than going after domestic facilities.
Still, Mr. Cheney's proposals are expected to run into flak
from lawmakers who contend the Pentagon has been unwilling to
seek equally deep cuts in its plans for acquiring
multibillion-dollar new weapons.

   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms rose across the board for the week
ended yesterday, but continued to trail those available to
investors on Treasury securities.
   The biggest gains were among small-denomination CDs sold
by leading brokerage firms. Average yields on six-month CDs
rose to 8.37% from 8.29%, while average yields on five-year
CDs climbed to 8.93% from 8.85%, according to figures
compiled by Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information
service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CDs sold directly by banks offered somewhat lower yields,
according to an 18-bank survey by Banxquote. The average
yield on small-denomination, one-year CDs was 8.08%, up from
8.02% the week before, while five-year consumer CDs offered
8.26%, up from 8.20%
   For large-denomination CDs, which typically require
deposits of $90,000 or more, the average six-month yield was
8.13%, up from 8.04%, while one-year yields were 8.33%, up
from 8.25%
   Despite the increases, investors could do even better with
Treasurys, which have offered sharply higher yields in the
past couple of weeks because of renewed inflationary fears.
Six-month Treasury bills, for instance, were yielding 8.5%
yesterday, while investors willing to lock up their money for
three or more years could get yields in excess of 9%.
   "Banks will be under a lot of pressure to increase CD
yields even further to make them competitive with equivalent
Treasury securities," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of
Banxquote.
   Typically, bank yields lag Treasury yields when interest
rates are rising. That's because banks adjust their yields
periodically to reflect the need for deposits and local
competitive factors; yields on Treasury securities are tied
directly to developments in the money markets.
   Currently, CD yields show considerable variation from
region to region, with banks in Texas and Florida offering
some of the least attractive levels. For example, the
five-year CD average in Texas is 7.50%, compared with 8.47%
in New York and 8.53% in Pennsylvania. Average yields on
three-month CDs were 7.13% at Florida banks and 7.21% at
Texas banks, compared with 7.88% at both Pennsylvania and New
York banks.
   Chase Manhattan Bank in New York is offering a 9.17% yield
on five-year jumbo CDs, one of the highest in the nation,
according to Banxquote. Continental Bank in Chicago is
offering a 9% yield on five-year jumbos.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Minority Holders in CSX Dispute
   Are Stung by Appraisal of Shares

   A Maryland judge delivered a costly defeat to a group of
minority shareholders who contended they weren't treated
fairly in a CSX Corp. restructuring plan.
   Squeezed out in the 1987 reorganization, the minority
holders of Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. had contended they
weren't offered fair value for their shares. But State
Circuit Court Judge Joseph H.H. Kaplan in Baltimore
disagreed, upholding an unusual appraisers' report that
concluded the CSX offer was too generous and that minority
stockholders deserved even less.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Legal experts say similar cases involving valuation of
minority stock usually end up either affirming company offers
or else awarding the holders additional money. "This is sort
of a man-biting-the-dog situation," says Richard Magid, an
attorney in Baltimore with Whiteford, Taylor &amp; Preston,
counsel for CSX. "I've never heard of appraisers coming in
below what a company had offered."
   The suit grew out of a plan in which CSX decided to merge
its Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co. unit with the B&amp;O road. At
the time, B&amp;O was about 95%-owned by the C&amp;O Railway. CSX
offered to pay the minority holders $124 a share for their
holdings. Roughly one-third of the minority holders accepted
the offer, but others went to court, alleging that the fair
value of the stock was $412.17 a share.
   Last month, a panel of three court-appointed appraisers
determined that the fair value of the stock was $112.44 a
share, $11.56 less than CSX had offered and $299.73 less than
the plaintiffs had been seeking. Based on some 80,000
minority shares Mr. Magid said were represented in the suit,
the price differential would amount to about $1 million less
than CSX had offered, and about $24 million less than
plaintiffs were seeking.
   "In sum, we think the defendants overpaid," the appraisers
concluded. In their report, the appraisers observed that CSX
may have chosen to "err toward generosity" in an attempt to
avoid litigation. But they added that the definition of "fair
value" doesn't encompass any "largess" that might have been
included in the merger price. Judge Kaplan didn't issue a
written opinion when he approved the report Monday.
   William Klein II, a New York attorney for several of the
minority holders, said that the decision was a "shock" but
that it probably wouldn't be appealed. "I think it's wrong,
but it's American now to say, to hell with shareholders,"
said Mr. Klein, an attorney with Tenzer, Greenblatt, Fallon &amp;
Kaplan.

   AETNA CHALLENGES state law controlling its exit from auto
insurance market.
   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. has filed suit in federal court
in Boston attacking the constitutionality of two
Massachusetts laws that dictate how an insurer can withdraw
from the state's auto insurance market.
   Aetna and several other insurers, including Travelers
Inc., Xerox Corp.'s Crum &amp; Forster unit and Cigna Corp., have
announced plans to cut back on their auto insurance business
nationwide or drop out entirely because they face mounting
losses.
   The suit challenges one Massachusetts statute that forces
insurers to pay a yearly assessement for eight years to the
state's pool for high-risk drivers, which is shunned by
conventional insurers. Payment of the fee would allow Aetna
to withdraw from the Massachusetts auto insurance market but
retain its licenses to sell other insurance. The company
estimates that paying this fee for eight years could amount
to well over $200 million.
   The other law contested in the suit gives the insurance
commissioner the power to revoke all of an insurer's licenses
if the company pulls out of the car insurance market.
   The Massachusetts laws would force an insurer "to pay an
extortionate tax or give up its valuable property," says
Stephen Deutsch, an attorney with Foley, Hoag &amp; Eliot,
counsel to Aetna.
   Fund American Cos. and Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., have decided to give up all insurance
licenses in Massachusetts. But Aetna, the state's
second-largest insurer behind Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.,
does not want to do that.
   Timothy Gailey, Massachusetts's insurance commissioner,
believes that if Aetna wins its suit, a state's ability to
control its markets would be reduced. "A state should be able
to say which companies can go or stay under reasonable
conditions."
   If the Massachusetts regulations are struck down in court,
"other states won't try to use this extortionate device as a
means of trapping companies into their local economies," says
Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard
University who is working with Aetna's attorneys.
   Earlier this year in California, Travelers successfully
challenged a provision of the state's Proposition 103 that
would have made it impossible for a company to withdraw from
a segment of the insurance market.
   In New Jersey, an insurer can be asked to turn in all of
its licenses if it plans to quit the personal insurance
business, although the decision is made at the discretion of
the insurance commissioner.
   New Jersey's insurance department has won a preliminary
injunction against Twin Cities Insurance Co., a unit of ITT
Hartford Group, keeping the company from leaving the state
without developing an orderly plan of withdrawal.

   TWO SENATORS FACING ETHICS inquiries set up legal defense
funds.
   Sen. David Durenberger, who is being investigated by the
Senate Ethics Committee for questionable financial
transactions involving a book promotion arrangement and real
estate dealings, has hired GOP fund-raiser Steven Gordon to
help fatten his legal fund, which was set up in March.
   A spokesman for the Minnesota Republican said yesterday
that Sen. Durenberger owes more than $100,000 to the two law
firms that are representing him in the ethics investigation,
Washington's Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O'Donnell &amp; Weyher and
Minneapolis's Popham, Haik, Schnindbrich, Kaufman &amp; Doty.
   The head of the Durenberger Legal Expense Trust Fund,
Minnesota businessman Wheelock Whitney, said the committee
would accept contributions only from individuals. Under
Senate rules, individuals and political action committees can
give a maximum of $10,000 a year to such legal funds.
   Sen. Durenberger hasn't yet disclosed any of the
contributors to the fund and isn't required to do so until
July. Mr. Gordon declined to comment on who he was
soliciting.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, one of five senators facing an ethics
inquiry into their ties to thrift executive Charles Keating,
reported last month that he has raised $105,510 for his legal
defense fund during the first three months of 1990. Among
those giving the maximum $10,000 contribution were the
fashion designer Liz Claiborne and her husband, Arthur
Ortenberg. Former Commerce Secretary Philip Klutznick gave
$2,000. Sen. Cranston, a California Democrat, also received
$10,000 from a political action committee sponsored by the
sheet metal workers union.
   Sen. Cranston has paid two Washington law firms, Powell,
Goldstein, Frazer &amp; Murphy and Zuckerman, Spaeder, Goldstein,
Taylor &amp; Kolker $97,575 from his legal fund.
   Five other senators are facing ethics inquiries, but they
are paying their legal bills out of personal funds or
campaign funds.

   LAWYER IS TRIED ON CHARGES of helping sell Ashland Oil
secrets to Iran.
   Charles Barnett, of Palm Beach, Fla., is accused of fraud
in a scheme to sell confidential Ashland Oil Co. documents to
the Iranian national oil company. Federal prosecutors allege
that Iran planned to use the documents in a suit against
Ashland, and that Mr. Barnett, in return, would have received
a cut of any damages Iran won. The case also involves former
Ashland Chairman Orin Atkins, who last year pleaded guilty to
two counts of conspiracy and wire fraud for his role in the
scheme. Mr. Atkins is expected to testify against Mr.
Barnett.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has charged that
Mr. Atkins, who will be sentenced this summer, initiated the
plan in 1982 after being forced to resign his executive
posts. But in his opening arguments this week, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Herve Gouraige said Mr. Barnett was instrumental in
getting the Iranians to agree to the alleged scheme.
   Mr. Barnett, 38 years old, "thoroughly familiarized
himself with the contents of the stolen Ashland documents so
that he could explain their usefulness to the Iranians," Mr.
Gouraige said. Iran sued Ashland in 1985 for $780 million for
not paying for oil delivered in 1979. Ashland settled the
case last year by agreeing to pay $325 million.
   Mr. Barnett's attorney, Marvin Segal, said in his opening
statement to the jury that Mr. Barnett's efforts were part of
a "legal enterprise to help the Iranian oil company collect
the money it avowedly was owed."
   An Ashland attorney, the first witness in the case,
testified that the company had refused to pay Iran for the
oil because it believed Iran had breached the contract.

   JUDGE ORDERS BREAK in Marcos trial while defense
interviews witnesses in the Philippines.
   Federal Judge John Keenan said he will recess Imelda
Marcos's racketeering trial for two weeks in June so that
defense attorneys can take depositions from at least two
witnesses -- including one who claims he helped Ferdinand
Marcos recover a mysterious hoard of gold. Mrs. Marcos's
attorneys say the witnesses are unable to leave the
Philippines.
   Mrs. Marcos, who fled the Philippines with her husband in
1986, is charged with stealing more than $160 million from
the Philippines and secretly hiding the assets in the U.S.
Mr. Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for 20 years, died in
September.
   Attorneys for Mrs. Marcos say Orlando Dulay, an
ex-military officer, will testify that he transported large
amounts of the gold to the Marcos home. They say the
discovery of the gold, supposedly hidden in the Philippines
by a Japanese general during World War II, accounts for the
Marcoses' immense wealth. Prosecutors say the couple amassed
millions by plundering the Philippines treasury. Mr. Dulay is
in jail on charges of killing campaign workers for Philippine
President Corazon Aquino.
   Judge Keenan refused to lift Mrs. Marcos's bail
restrictions to allow her to return to the Philippines for
the depositions.
   He also rejected a request that a deposition be taken from
Mrs. Aquino, who succeeded Mr. Marcos as president.

   AN EXPERIMENTAL PRO BONO program that would be voluntary
for lawyers has been endorsed by New York State's highest
judge. Chief Judge Sol Wachtler of the Court of Appeals made
the announcement in response to a proposal that the state's
80,000 lawyers be required to perform a minimum of 40 hours
of public service work every two years. The recommendation
was made earlier this week by a committee appointed by Judge
Wachtler. He said that if a voluntary program fails, he will
propose that the courts force lawyers to provide free legal
serivces to the poor.

   WASHINGTON -- David Mullins hasn't joined the Federal
Reserve yet, but he already sounds like an old-timer.
   Mr. Mullins is the assistant Treasury secretary who is
awaiting Senate approval to a seat on the Fed's board of
governors. In written answers submitted to the Senate Banking
Committee recently, Mr. Mullins said he would oppose
immediate release of the minutes of Fed meetings. Immediate
release of the minutes has long been urged by outsiders, but
is staunchly opposed by Fed officials, who value their
secrecy. Mr. Mullins said release of the minutes "may add to
volatility" in the financial markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Mullins also said he would oppose legislation
requiring regular audits of the Fed by the Congress's General
Accounting Office, saying that would compromise "the
independence of the Fed."
   But Mr. Mullins expressed some disagreement with Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan on which federal regulator should set
margin, or credit, requirements, for stock-index futures. Mr.
Mullins said the Fed may be the appropriate agency; Mr.
Greenspan has argued against giving the Fed that power.
   The Treasury official indicated little interest in his own
department's efforts to intervene in foreign-exchange
markets, saying: "In my view, intervention in the
foreign-exchange markets has never been an especially
important tool of United States monetary policy."

   Commodities:
   Futures Prices in Soybeans Fluctuate Wildly,
   Close Modestly Lower as Some Funds Speculate

   Speculative commodity funds dominated trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade, sending soybean futures prices
fluctuating wildly in a 31-cent range before they closed
modestly lower by day's end.
   "This was a pure and simple money game; there weren't any
fundamental reasons for the market move," said Daniel Basse,
director of marketing for AgResource Co. in Chicago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The funds started buying soybeans and soybean meal and oil
futures early in the session, traders said. With little
apparent selling interest on the floor, local traders
followed the funds and started buying as well. Soybeans for
July delivery soared to an intraday high of $6.715 a bushel
by midsession -- more than 10% higher than they were just two
weeks ago.
   Skyrocketing futures prices in Chicago didn't go unnoticed
on the farm. An increase in soybean sales by farmers reported
at grain elevators in several Midwestern states by late
morning may have helped tip the scales against the rally,
said Victor Lespinasse, a futures analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. on the Board of Trade.
   Farmers who waited until after lunch to sell their
soybeans might have wondered what all the excitement was
about.
   For whatever reason, the same funds and local traders that
had loaded up on soybean futures early in the session quickly
started dumping their contracts around noon, Chicago time.
Waves of sell orders swamped the Board of Trade soybean
trading pit, forcing July soybean futures to a daily low of
$6.405 a bushel before bouncing back a bit to close at $6.435
a bushel, down five cents a bushel for the day.
   Analysts said that at one point during the selling
stampede, some pit traders even started spreading false
rumors about export sales of soybean products to the Soviet
Union to try to stem the price slide.
   Excellent weather and moisture conditions across many
soybean planting regions in the U.S. suggest that futures
prices ought to go down as soybean plants come up, beginning
in a few weeks in many areas, analysts said. Indeed, one
rumor yesterday had forecasts for sharply lower soybean
prices being made tomorrow at a crop-outlook seminar being
sponsored by the Agriculture Department in Kansas City, Mo.
   Another factor that may weigh on soybean futures prices is
the relatively robust level of Brazilian soybean exports,
despite recent rains that have hampered that country's
soybean harvest. In addition, many Brazilian farmers may sell
soybeans this month to pay off government production loans
coming due in mid-May, said Mr. Basse.
   July wheat futures prices followed soybeans lower, closing
down four cents a bushel at $3.4175 a bushel. July corn
futures gained 1.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.8475 a
bushel.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices rose as traders were reluctant to
be caught short ahead of the meeting of the monitoring
committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, scheduled to begin today in Geneva. Oil ministers
scheduled an emergency meeting to try to find ways to prop up
the price of crude, which has fallen sharply over the past
month or more. The ministers are expected to discuss
production cuts as a means of reducing the world's oil glut.
West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery ended at
$18.81 a barrel, up 27 cents, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Gasoline and heating oil contracts also rose. After
trading ended on the Merc, the American Petroleum Institute
reported that crude oil inventories decreased slightly and
that gasoline stocks also fell. While the report would
normally be considered somewhat bullish, any news from the
OPEC meeting in Geneva will probably eclipse the American
Petroleum Institute in its importance to the market.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose sharply on buying triggered by
an unexpected drop in copper stocks and by options-related
activity in the London market. The July delivery was up 4.40
cents a pound to $1.1330, though it traded as high as $1.1450
before late profit-taking trimmed the advance. The London
Metal Exchange is now reporting copper inventories twice a
week, Tuesdays and Fridays, rather than only on Mondays. The
Metal Exchange yesterday reported that its stocks had fallen
7,525 tons to 55,150 tons, compared with general expectations
of a 3,000-to-4,000 ton increase. Traders who had bought
copper call options on the Metal Exchange decided to exercise
their right to buy futures contracts, said Fred Demler,
metals economist for PaineWebber, New York. As a result, he
said, traders who had sold the options contracts were forced
to buy futures and make delivery, which drove prices sharply
higher, Mr. Demler said. In the New York futures market, Mr.
Demler observed that the spot April contract on the Commodity
Exchange expired last Thursday at a strong price, amid
concern that there wouldn't be enough deliverable copper to
satisfy contracts outstanding. Since then, trading had turned
quiet and prices had eased. "Now the tightness of supplies is
exerting itself again" as a price-moving factor, he said. He
noted that U.S. consumption of copper during the first
quarter was up 3% from the year-earlier period, while global
deliveries of copper, which are an indication of use, were up
9% during January and February, compared with the same two
months of 1989, according to the American Bureau of Metal
Statistics, a private statistical organization. U.S. consumer
supplies are also low, Mr. Demler said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were higher, with silver
and platinum leading and gold lagging. July delivery silver
was up eight cents an ounce to $5.0950, while July platinum
ended with a gain of $5.60 an ounce at $479.70. June gold
advanced $1.30 an ounce to $372.70. Silver and platinum
traded in a wide range, while gold's fluctuations were
relatively narrow. July silver traded as high as $5.1300, and
July platinum hit a high of $485.50. According to one
analyst, gold showed less volatility because its price didn't
break through any technical barriers, unlike the situation in
both silver and platinum. Active buying of contracts was
triggered in silver when the July contract traded above $5.10
and in platinum when July rose above $480. A damping factor
in gold, as well, said the analyst, was that the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will hold
meetings over the weekend. The U.S. some time ago proposed
the sale by the IMF of some of its gold to make up for
defaults of some members, the analyst said. While the
proposal met strong negative reaction at first, a more
positive attitude has been growing recently, he said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices swung widely both above and below
Monday's close before ending slightly lower. The July
contract settled at 15.96 cents a pound for a loss of 0.06
cent a pound, but during the session it traded as high as
16.27 cents and as low as 15.72 cents. The market opened
easier and sank to its low of the day, said Judith Ganes,
analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., New York. Then, she said, it
shot up to the day's high before late profit-taking erased
the gains toward the close and dropped the price to a net
loss. There were no new developments and the market was
technically driven, said Ms. Ganes. She said the absence of
many European traders, who were observing May Day, could have
accounted for some of the volatility. One reason the futures
market was unable to retain its gains was that there has been
little demand for physical sugar in the world market, even
though supplies are tight, she said.

   GENEVA -- OPEC ministers meeting here to attempt to prop
up oil prices arrived apparently convinced that short-term
production cuts are the only way to calm nervous oil markets.
   As a result, their main task when they officially open
their session today is expected to be determining the size of
such cuts and how they'll be shared among the 13 members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Technically, the emergency meeting called by Sadek
Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and acting OPEC president,
is only of the organization's policy-setting monitoring
committee. But Mr. Boussena invited all ministers to attend,
and as they arrived yesterday, most quickly began informal
consultations. Many also met with Mr. Boussena last night.
   The ministers were summoned on only about 10 days' notice
to figure out ways to halt a steep petroleum price slide. The
meeting was seen as so urgent that it was called even though
a regular session had already been scheduled for May 25. Mr.
Boussena pushed that back to June 25.
   World oil prices have skidded as much as $6 a barrel this
year, mostly because OPEC's output has been running as much
as two million barrels a day ahead of its official first-half
production ceiling. Only in recent days have prices come off
their lows to stabilize, in part because of OPEC's planned
meeting and signs that its production is already easing some.
Yesterday, oil prices rose as traders tried to avoid being
caught short by today's meeting.
   As they arrived, several ministers made clear that they
are disturbed by current oil prices.
   "We want them higher," said Hisham Nazer, oil minister of
Saudi Arabia. The kingdom, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates generally are cited as major contributors to the oil
glut because they have been producing beyond their quotas.
   Still, most of the oil ministers appeared to be in
agreement with Mr. Boussena on the task before them. "The
target is clear: {elimination} of the surplus in the market,"
Mr. Boussena said.
   Mr. Boussena then proposed a solution: OPEC production
cuts of one million to 1.5 million barrels a day. However, he
said the question of whether all members including those such
as Algeria that already are producing below their quotas
should cut back "is one of the issues we will discuss."
   Other suggestions of possible reductions ranged from
500,000 barrels a day to two million. Whatever the figure,
the consensus seemed to be that any measures taken here
should be limited to May and June and that the meeting be
kept brief to avoid controversy that might further upset oil
markets. OPEC's second-half production ceiling and
country-by-country quotas should be left to the regular
summer conference, several ministers insisted.
   "We have to concentrate on what is happening now," said
Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil minister.
   Differences have surfaced over how much OPEC is producing
at the moment. Some delegates suggested that some ministers
are inflating estimates of total production to make any cuts
look larger. On the other hand, there have been indications
recently that production already is coming down from the
eight-year high of 24 million barrels a day reached in March.
Buyers have been balking as storage tanks are brimful, and
some exporters have refused to discount prices further to
move more of their oil.
   Current output estimates range between 23 million and 24
million barrels a day. Most are right about in the middle,
though Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister,
puts it at the top of the range. "It's quite high," he told
reporters. "It will have to go down quite a bit."
   OPEC's economists are warning that continued output in the
current range would mean an enormous increase in oil
inventories. They cautioned that the increases could reach
2.2 million to 3.2 million barrels a day and that this
development could lead to another price fall similar to last
month's.
   In their latest report, the economists again slightly
revised upward their projected demand for OPEC oil for 1990
to 22.5 million barrels a day. Still, they noted that demand
for OPEC oil, excluding inventory changes, totals only 20.9
million barrels a day this quarter. Their estimates for the
third and fourth-quarter demand are 21.4 million and 24.3
million, respectively.
   Those figures aren't much different from estimates made by
some outside oil economists. Paul Mlotok of Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co. forecast demand for OPEC oil at an average of 23 million
barrels a day for the year, though he said it will run below
that this quarter. "They really do need to hold it {output}
down for May and June," he said.

   Millard Drexler, president of the Gap Inc., credited with
rejuvenating the apparel chain, sold 368,000 shares in
January and March for $23 million, according to the company's
proxy statement. Since most of the shares were granted him
under his compensation agreement, most of the $23 million is
a net gain to him.
   Mr. Drexler also received salary and cash bonuses last
year totaling $1,745,981. He still owns 1.2 million
restricted shares, obtained through grants, currently worth
nearly $78 million. Mr. Drexler transformed the Gap from a
jeans reseller to a more successful casual-wear chain with
more diversified merchandise, in the process driving up the
San Bruno, Calif.-based company's earnings and stock price
over the past three years.

   Protesters Disrupt Soviet May Day Parade
   ---
   Gorbachev, Kremlin Leaders
   Leave Places Atop Tomb
   Amid Jeers From Crowd

   MOSCOW -- Soviet leaders headed by President Mikhail
Gorbachev walked out of Red Square in the middle of May Day
celebrations as the workers' parade turned into an
unprecedented protest against their rule.
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators whistled and jeered as
grim-faced members of the Politburo and Presidential Council
left their positions atop Lenin's Mausoleum and headed for
the privacy of the Kremlin after 90 minutes. The
demonstration continued for an hour before it was dispersed
by KGB security police and a dozen cleaning trucks spraying
water.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many of the marchers carried banners attacking Mr.
Gorbachev personally and socialism in general. "The
Ceausescus of the Politburo should get out of their armchairs
and go to jail," read one. "Communists -- Don't have any
illusions, you're bankrupt," read another. "Gorbachev --
Enough of making fools of the people. Resign]" said a third.
   Dozens of demonstrators protested Moscow's strong-arm
tactics against Lithuania, which declared its independence
last month. They waved yellow, red and green Lithuanian flags
or placards calling for freedom for the Baltic republic and
an end to the economic blockade imposed by Moscow. "Free
Lithuania -- Shame on the imperialist president," one banner
read.
   The parade was the most vivid display of public anger at
the Kremlin's rule to date. The slogans are typical of
demonstrations that have taken place in the Soviet capital
and elsewhere in recent weeks. But by taking to Red Square
itself, a place almost sacrosanct in Soviet lore, the
radicals noisily underscored the growing national mood of
rebellion.
   As they moved past huge portraits of Marx, Engels and
Lenin on the wall of a department store opposite Lenin's
tomb, one group of protestors unfurled a banner declaring,
"Marxism-Leninism -- On the trash heap of history." Walking
behind a priest carrying a cross was another group with a
placard reading: "Gorbachev is the chief patron of the
mafia."
   They were allowed to take part in the parade after Moscow
authorities decided to open it up this year to a wider
public. In the past, only hand-picked labor union and other
officials marched past the mausoleum while the leadership
looked on and waved. But Moscow's Communist Party leader,
Yuri Prokofiev, last week threw open participation to anyone
to reflect the new official tolerance of pluralism. Mr.
Prokofiev said at the time that "anti-constitutional slogans"
wouldn't be allowed.
   As the protest got out of hand, organizers were at a loss
as to how to react. Festive music continued to blare from
loud speakers around the square after the Soviet leadership
departed, while KGB officers in dress uniform carried on
strutting up and down in front of Lenin's tomb.
   Behind the mausoleum, Mr. Prokofiev and Gavriil Popov, the
radical economist recently elected mayor of Moscow, conferred
grimly for about 15 minutes. Mr. Gorbachev's wife, Raisa,
came over to talk with them briefly before joining her
husband inside the Kremlin.
   Soviet television, which usually broadcasts the whole
event, cut off its transmission just before Mr. Gorbachev and
his colleagues left. In its evening news program, it said "a
few people" had spoiled the parade's festive atmosphere, but
didn't show either the Kremlin leadership leaving or any of
the most critical slogans. The official Tass news agency, in
an unusually brief report about the proceedings, said only
that "some slogans were extremist. They called for direct
confrontation with constitutional authorities, not
consolidation of forces."
   Its report dwelled on the unorthodox, more open nature of
the rally. "The pluralism of slogans is graphic evidence," it
reported blandly. "Only recently it was difficult to imagine
some of the placards appearing in Red Square."
   The May Day celebration started as planned, with 40
minutes of speeches by labor officials largely echoing
slogans of the leadership, including calls for a market
economy. Workers then paraded through the square with
balloons and offical placards calling for "real wages for
real work," and rejecting unemployment.
   Then the radicals took over. Apart from the many attacks
on Mr. Gorbachev and socialism, their banners reflected a
grabbag of grievances. "Gorbachev is the president of the
Kremlin-Yeltsin is president of the people," read one,
referring to Mr. Gorbachev's recent election by the
parliament to the newly established presidency. Radicals
wanted a national vote. "Let the Communist Party live in
Chernobyl," read another banner, referring to the site of a
major nuclear accident in 1986.
   The last big rally held in the vicinity took place in
February, about 500 yards away from Red Square, when
protestors called for the Communist Party to relinquish its
monopoly on power. That demonstration was widely believed to
have been officially orchestrated to put pressure on the
Central Committee, which met later that week to discuss the
issue. But since then no rallies have been allowed so close
to the seat of Soviet power. In fact, the government last
month banned all demonstrations in the center of Moscow. The
decision angered radicals in the newly elected city council,
which used to have jurisdiction over such matters.

   Blinder Robinson
   To Appeal Decision
   Of an SEC Judge

   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co. said it plans
to appeal sanctions against it that were handed down last
week by a Securities and Exchange Commission hearing officer.
   The penny-stock brokerage firm, once the nation's largest,
said it plans to appeal the decision of Brenda P. Murray to
the commission and then, if needed, to take "all necessary
and appropriate legal steps" to appeal an adverse SEC
decision in the courts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An appeal was expected. Blinder, a unit of
Intercontinental Enterprises Inc., has bitterly contested
regulatory and legal actions against it, and the current case
has been under way for several years. Another hearing officer
ruled in 1985 that Blinder Robinson and founder Meyer Blinder
violated securities laws in a 1980 stock underwriting, and
the commission concurred in 1986. But Blinder appealed in
1987; in early 1988, an appeals court panel sent the case
back to the SEC.
   In her decision, Ms. Murray suspended Blinder Robinson for
45 days and barred the firm from underwriting securities
offerings for two years. She also barred Mr. Blinder from
associating with any brokerage firm for at least two years.
   Responding to the judge's ruling, Blinder argued that Ms.
Murray had ignored the appeals court ruling and said the
confrontation between it and the commission will continue "as
long as the SEC continues to attempt to justify its
systematic destruction of one commercial enterprise and the
professional career of its founder under the guise of
protecting the public interest."

five years, the largest contract in the company's history.
   MCI said it reached the agreement to provide long-distance
services with the Navy Resale and Service Support Office.
That office provides merchandise, food and personal services
for U.S. Navy families. The agreement covers calls from pay
phones at Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard sites throughout
the contiguous U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico.

   The contract is the latest MCI has won since a 1989
federal court order to open the pay-phone market to carriers
besides American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. MCI, which
recently won similar contracts with the city of Dallas and
Philadelphia International Airport, among others, estimates
total annual sales in the U.S. long-distance pay-phone market
at $2 billion.
   Subcontractors to MCI will be Bell Atlantic Corp. and a

   In national over-the-counter trading, MCI closed at

   Rogers Communications Inc. said the company's president
and chief executive, Edward Rogers, raised his voting stake
in the company from 81%, to 89%, by converting some preferred
share holdings to Class A voting shares.
   Mr. Rogers held the 4,150,000 Series VII convertible
preferred shares through his wholly owned Rogers Real Estate
Development Ltd.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Toronto-based telecommunications
concern said the company had planned to exercise its right to
buy back the series at 10 Canadian dollars (US$8.59) a share,
if Mr. Rogers hadn't decided to convert the preferred shares.
   The conversion will save the company C$4 million in
dividend payments in 1990, the spokesman said. Because the
dividend rate is pegged to Canada's prime rate, which has
risen steadily in recent months, he said the dividend
payments have become "burdensome."
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the Class A
shares of Rogers closed at C$11, unchanged. The widely held
Class B non-voting shares closed at C$7.13, down 38 Canadian
cents.

   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan announced a major restructuring
aimed at strengthening its monetary operations and promoting
the monitoring of the activities of financial institutions at
home and abroad.
   The central bank's reorganization, which goes into effect
May 28, will reduce the number of its offices, departments
and institutes to 16 from 18.
</LP>

   The bank said a Market Operations division will be
established to monitor both money and capital markets and to
execute daily monetary operations in a comprehensive manner.
A Bank Relations division and Capital Markets division will
oversee activities of financial institutions at home and
abroad.
   A Financial and Payment System Department will be
established to cope with the increased risks to the financial
system posed by the trends toward financial deregulation,
globalization and computerization, the bank said. And an
International Department will combine the functions of the
current Foreign Department with the overseas research
function of the current Research and Statistics Department.
   To expand the central bank's international network, the
representative office in Hong Kong will be made the Bank of
Japan's third chief representative office, for Asia and
Oceania, joining New York, for North and South America, and
London, for Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Another
representative office will be added to Washington, D.C.,
bringing the total number of offices to six.

   Industrial Average Increases 12.16,
   Partly Due to Rise in Boeing Stock

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices moved higher after the first
piece of data on the economy's performance in April pointed
toward a recovery in the manufacturing sector.
   The report from the nation's purchasing managers helped
the market shake off another rise in interest rates, as did
well-received quarterly earnings reports from Chrysler and
Boeing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although some futures-related selling and profit-taking
just before the close cut into the market's gains, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average closed 12.16 higher at 2668.92.
Boeing, which jumped 2 1/2 to 72 1/4, accounted for more than
one-third of the rise in the 30-stock average.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
advanced 1.45 to 332.25, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index went up 0.73 to 182.22, and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index rose 1.33 to 309.46.
   Traders said buying interest remained concentrated on
larger-capitalization issues. Gainers outpaced losers by a
relatively narrow margin of 820 to 679 on the Big Board.
   Big Board volume amounted to 149,020,000 shares compared
with 122,750,000 shares Monday. Part of the improvement
stemmed from dividend-related trades by institutions that
boosted volume in the stock of Security Pacific, Chase
Manhattan and Eastern Utilities Associates.
   Stocks rallied at the opening and gave back only part of
the gains after the midmorning release of the purchasing
managers' report. The group's index of economic activity rose
in April to 50.2% from 48.8% in March. That marked the first
time in a year that the index stood above 50%, pointing
toward an expansion within the manufacturing sector.
   Bond prices retreated to lower levels on the report,
pushing the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
back above the 9% mark, but the downturn affected stocks only
briefly. "People have adjusted to rates being at these
levels," said Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Investors did more bargain-hunting in the market than they
have lately, Mr. Laux said, citing insurance stocks as a
sector that benefited from the renewed buying interest.
General Re went up 2 1/8 to 79 1/2, Aetna Life &amp; Casualty
advanced 1 1/2 to 47 5/8, Unum gained 3/4 to 44 1/8, and Aon
rose 5/8 to 35 1/2.
   Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.,
said the market would need "a new negative" at this point for
stocks to turn lower again. He added that prices appear more
likely to move closer to the upper end of their recent
trading range over the short term, with 2730 or higher for
the Dow industrial average as a target.
   "The market is really a trading affairrather than a
decisive bull or bear market," Mr. Metz said, citing "a
profound disinterest by professionals and amateurs alike."
   One potential negative for the market is the decline in
dividend payouts. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said yesterday that
there were 129 dividend increases last month, down from 149 a
year earlier. In the first four months of this year, dividend
omissions jumped to 83 from 39 in the same period last year,
while dividend decreases rose to 35 from 25. "Companies are
suffering from earnings declines and are harboring cash by
lowering dividends or omitting them entirely," said Arnold
Kaufman, editor of S&amp;P's "Outlook" newsletter.
   Security Pacific, Chase and Eastern Utilities took three
of the top four spots on the list of most active Big Board
issues as a result of trades designed to capture quarterly
payouts. Security Pacific finished unchanged at 36 on
composite volume of 3.7 million shares, Chase fell 1/2 to 24
7/8 on 3.6 million shares, and Eastern Utilities dipped 1/8
to 33 5/8 on two million shares.
   The fourth company on the most active list was Tosco,
which plummeted 5 1/4 to 17 1/4 on 2.5 million shares after
its board abandoned efforts to sell the company or its
refining business.
   Nearly 1.5 million shares of Boeing were traded in the
wake of its strong first-quarter earnings report. The
company's operating income climbed 87% from a year ago on a
60% sales increase.
   Chrysler rose 3/4 to 15 1/4 on 1.2 million shares after
its first-quarter earnings report proved better than
expected. While income from continuing operations was down
79% from a year earlier, Chrysler's auto operations posted a
profit for the quarter, which analysts didn't anticipate.

   House Unit Votes to Subpoena Milken,
   Offer Immunity in Return for Testimony

   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee voted unanimously
behind closed doors to subpoena deposed junk-bond king
Michael Milken and to offer him immunity in return for his
testimony.
   A hearing before the House Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee could be held in the summer, probably before
Aug. 3, when the House is scheduled to begin its summer
recess, individuals close to the subcommittee said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Milken's testimony probably would be his first public
statements on the junk-bond market he created since he
pleaded guilty to six violations of federal securities law
and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and restitution. That
settlement allowed Mr. Milken to avoid trial on an earlier
98-count indictment that charged him with racketeering and
securities fraud. If Mr. Milken hadn't pleaded guilty,
prosecutors were expected to seek a broader indictment.
   A spokesman for Mr. Milken said last week that the
financier would testify if he received full immunity. The
spokesman declined to elaborate further and wouldn't say
whether Mr. Milken has any topics he is eager to discuss with
the subcommittee.
   Under the rules of so-called use immunity, nothing Mr.
Milken said at the hearing could be used against him in a
federal or state court. The subcommittee's action now goes to
the full Energy and Commerce Committee, which is expected to
agree to the subpoena and immunity. If the panel approves,
the issue will be open for comment by such agencies as the
Justice Department, which could object to the terms of the
subpoena.
   A Justice Department spokesman wouldn't say whether the
department would object to the accord.
   The subcommittee and full committee are headed by Chairman
John Dingell (D., Mich.), who is impatient to question Mr.
Milken about the 400 or so investment partnerships that
included Mr. Milken and other Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
employees.
   While no wrongdoing has been charged concerning those
partnerships, committee members argued at a hearing in 1988
-- at which Mr. Milken cited his Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination -- that the partnerships allowed
the employees to enrich themselves at the expense of
customers.
   Moreover, the panel wants to ask Mr. Milken about the role
of junk bonds in the savings-and-loan industry. The federal
government is currently bailing out hundreds of insolvent
thrifts in a program that will cost taxpayers several hundred
billion dollars. Some thrift executives also have been
convicted of fraud in their management of the institutions.
   Mr. Milken, who built much of his business selling junk
bonds to thrifts, is thought to hold the key to unlocking the
secrets of dealings by many thrifts.
   In an odd twist, the government also hopes to use the
hearing to learn about the junk-bond market. Mr. Milken was
by far the largest market-maker for the high-yield, high-risk
debt securities, and established himself and Drexel as the
buyer of last resort. Since his departure from the market
more than a year ago, pricing of junk bonds has become
increasingly tricky, with some issues frequently unavailable
for trading.
   Mr. Dingell has expressed concern in the past about the
lack of easy-to-find prices and volume data for junk bonds.
And recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission released
a report on junk bonds that was notable for how much the
agency didn't know about the market.

   Kinark Corp. said its board received a $7-a-share, or
about $24.8 million, acquisition proposal from Steel Partners
Limited Partnership, a New York investment partnership.
Kinark shares closed at $5.625, down 25 cents, in American
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   Kinark said that it told Steel Partners the Tulsa, Okla.,
company isn't for sale, but that its board will consider the
bid. The proposal is the latest attack on the embattled
company, which owns galvanizing plants and chemical-storage
facilities. Altair Corp., Lincolnshire, Ill., has said it is
nominating three directors to Kinark's eight-member board at
the May 23 annual meeting in opposition to Kinark's three
nominees. Altair owns 6.7% of Kinark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kinark said Steel Partners has indicated it owns about
4.4% of Kinark's 3.5 million shares outstanding. Steel
Partners, which includes Larry Butler and Warren
Lichtenstein, said its bid is contingent on the group's
arranging financing and Kinark's completing its planned sale
of its hotel properties for $12 million. Kinark had
first-quarter profit of $626,000, or 18 cents a share, on
sales of $8.3 million.

   Senate GOP Offers
   Plan to Overhaul
   Election Financing

   WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans yesterday unveiled their
proposals for overhauling the system of financing federal
campaigns. Democrats promptly denounced the proposals as
insufficient.
   The Republican campaign-finance package would eliminate
political action committees, reduce and require stricter
disclosure of "soft money" contributions made to state
political parties, restrict contributions from out-of-state
individual donors, create a special fund for congressional
challengers, and provide lower broadcast rates to candidates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These proposals, which Senate Republican Leader Robert
Dole hailed as an "historic and challenging campaign-reform
package," will soon be introduced as legislation by Kentucky
Republican Mitch McConnell, who led the filibuster that
killed campaign-finance legislation in the Senate two years
ago.
   Two leading Democrats, Majority Leader George Mitchell of
Maine and Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, said the GOP
proposals unveiled yesterday wouldn't stem the flow of
special-interest money in politics because they wouldn't cap
the overall amount of money candidates can spend in their
campaigns. "Without limits on spending there cannot be
genuine reform," Sen. Mitchell said.
   There has been a partisan logjam on campaign finance for
years, with Democrats advocating spending caps and
Republicans resisting them. Democrats are also much cooler to
the idea of eliminating the role of PACs, and several
Democratic senators said that proposals to abolish them would
be unconstitutional.
   Yesterday, Sen. Boren indicated that Democrats might be
willing to agree to the centerpiece of the Republican
packagethe abolition of PACs-but only if the Republicans were
willing to embrace some form of spending limits.
   Democrats, meanwhile, have been meeting for weeks in an
attempt to reach consensus on various campaign-finance
proposals. Democrats who face re-election in 1992 are seeking
an array of transitional provisions to preserve certain
fund-raising advantages they enjoy under the current law. But
Sen. Boren said the Democrats are close to agreement and hope
to unveil their proposals in the next few days.
   The question left unanswered yesterday is if there is any
real hope that the partisan deadlock on campaign finance can
be broken this year. "There's still plenty of room for
negotiation," Sen. Boren said.

   Test Drug Used for Treating
   Alzheimer's Disease Gets
   Contradictory Reports

   Researchers reported that the controversial drug THA
provided no benefit to patients with Alzheimer's disease in a
controlled study conducted in Montreal.
   The study is the most recent in a series of contradictory
reports about the drug's usefulness in treating Alzheimer's
disease, a degenerative brain disorder that causes premature
senility. Warner-Lambert Co., which is conducting a large
test of THA in the U.S., last week said its own study shows
that about 40% of patients are responding positively to the
drug.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, two doctors writing in the Journal of the
American Medical Association warned that the costs of caring
for elderly people disabled by Alzheimer's, hip fractures and
other degenerative diseases will soar as the number of people
over 85 rises four to six times by 2040. The doctors, Edward
Schneider and Jack Guralnik, called for large increases in
research spending to cure, or delay the onset of,
debilitating diseases.
   According to some tests, THA has offered hope for helping
Alzheimer's patients. At its annual meeting last week,
Warner-Lambert said it plans to send its positive findings to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June and expects the
agency to approve the drug for sale in the U.S.
   The Canadian research, however, suggests that THA's impact
on Alzheimer's patients may be uncertain at best. Doctors at
the McGill Center for Studies in Aging found that 20 patients
given the drug fared about as well as 19 patients taking a
placebo in four different tests of their memory, mental
status, behavior and ability to function.
   The study, led by Serge Gauthier, is to be published in
tomorrow's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine and
its release to the public has been embargoed until tonight.
But copies of the report, and details of its negative
findings, began circulating on Wall Street late last week.
The Wall Street Journal obtained several copies of the report
from people who aren't constrained by the press embargo.
   At its annual meeting, Warner-Lambert confirmed the
existence of the report, its negative findings, and its
expected publication in the widely read medical journal when
a securities analyst asked Chairman Joseph Williams about it.
The analyst, James Keeney of Mabon Nugent, said that he heard
about the study in a chance conversation with a company
executive just before the annual meeting.
   Analysts linked the report to the decline in
Warner-Lambert's shares on Friday and Monday. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the Morris
Plains, N.J., health-care company's shares closed at
$105.375, up 25 cents. It had closed at $107.25 last
Thursday.
   The Canadian study's results are surprising because they
contradict a preliminary finding reported by Dr. Gauthier
last year. That report found that patients' families saw
heightened awareness and spontaneity among those given the
drug during a initial start-up test. But in the new report,
the researchers said the earlier benefit dissipated when the
drug's use was compared with a placebo over a four-week study
period.
   Warner-Lambert said its study is getting positive results
because it is testing the drug only in patients who have
shown some response to the drug. Dr. Gauthier's study didn't
test such an "enriched" population. Warner-Lambert said it
believes the drug, which it hopes to market under the name
Cognex, will benefit only a small portion of people with
Alzheimer's and that its study, which will study 300 people
when completed, is designed to test the drug in this
pre-selected group.
   Dr. Gauthier said he has stopped testing THA because side
effects forced him to use doses of the drug so low that its
effectiveness disappeared. In some patients, the drug
increased the level of kidney enzymes, an indication of
kidney damage. Warner-Lambert's study also uncovered this
problem, but the company said the problem is reversible when
the drug is discontinued and can be avoided by using very low
doses.
   Dr. Gauthier used 100 milligrams of the drug per day,
while Warner-Lambert is using 40 mg to 80 mg in its test.
   "There may be a group who will benefit from THA," Dr.
Gauthier said. "But they will be very hard to find."
   Writing separately in AMA journal, Dr. Schneider and Dr.
Guralnik said that the prevalence of dementia, which includes
Alzheimer's, rises sharply with age to 28% for people 85 and
above, from only 2.8% for those between the ages of 65 and
74.
   Speaking at a news conference called by the Alliance for
Aging Research, a consortium of medical and business
organizations pressing for more spending on programs to
attack diseases that afflict the aged, the doctors said that
only research breakthroughs can significantly limit the rise
in health care costs as the nation ages.
   "By investing $1 billion a year in research over the next
decade, we could cut the number afflicted by disabling
diseases in half or delay onset for five years and save more
than half a trillion dollars" per decade in the cost of
caring for the elderly, Dr. Schneider said. While THA has
shown a "minimally positive" impact, future generations of
drugs will offer more hope, he said.

   THE DRUG THA, being tested by Warner-Lambert Co. for
treating Alzheimer's disease, can cause an increase in liver
enzymes in some patients, a sign of liver damage. The
condition is reversible when the drug's use is stopped and
can be eliminated at low doses. Yesterday's edition
incorrectly said the drug affected kidney enzymes.

   Fund American Cos., Greenwich, Conn., said first-quarter
net income fell 4.3% to $34.9 million, or 65 cents a share,
mainly reflecting continued weak pricing in the
property-casualty insurance market.
   The company, formerly Fireman's Fund, had a underwriting
loss of $130.3 million in its property-casualty business. For
every dollar of premium the insurer took in during the
quarter, the company paid out $1.19 in claims and other
expenses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue advanced 9% to $904 million from $831 million. The
1990 results included a pretax $30 million realized
investment gain. The company had net of $36.5 million, or 66
cents a share, in the 1989 period.
   The slump in the equity and bond markets hurt results,
reducing Fund American's per-share book value to $35.04 from
$36.21 at Dec. 31. Pretax unrealized appreciation in the
company's portfolio of equity securities declined to $93
million, and the excess of market value over book value on
the company's fixed-maturity portfolio declined $68 million
to $13 million as of March 31. However, the $30 million in
pretax realized investment gain offset some of the unrealized
losses.

   LONDON -- Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. joined the list
of international financial firms that are trimming their
equities operations here.
   The U.S. securities house, a unit of Prudential Insurance
Co. of America, Newark, N.J., said it is "substantially
downsizing" its equities operation in Britain because of
lackluster returns. The firm, which started making markets in
British stocks about a year ago, is cutting about 20 of 30
jobs in the line and eliminating most of its
equities-research department.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman said Prudential-Bache will continue to make
markets in 10 big British stocks, and provide brokerage
services. "Market conditions in the U.K. have quite simply
forced us to reassess (our) commitment to the U.K. equities
market," the firm said.
   Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp. and Morgan Grenfell are
among the firms that have sharply reduced or eliminated their
British equities operations amid overcapacity and lackluster
profits in the competitive London markets. Prudential-Bache
employs about 500 people in London, in a variety of foreign
exchange, trading and corporate finance activities.

   The litigation began in 1984 when Colorado Interstate, a
unit of Houston-based Coastal Corp., sued Natural Gas
Pipeline Co. of America and NGPL-Trailblazer Inc. for alleged
antitrust violations, breach of contract and wrongful
interference.
   Last September, the 10th Circuit Court overturned a lower
court ruling that ordered the Occidental units to pay $412
million to Colorado Interstate on the antitrust and
breach-of-contract charges. But the circuit court upheld
Colorado Interstate's wrongful interference claim. The two
sides disputed the amount of the claim.
   The Wyoming ruling affirmed Colorado Interstate's claim
that the judgment was for $28 million, including interest.
Occidental maintained that the amount should be only $8
million. Separately, a Coastal spokesman said Colorado
Interstate petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court last week to
review the circuit court's ruling on the antitrust and breach
of contract allegations.

   Temco National Corp., Columbus, Ohio, said it sold its
Wendt-Bristol Medical Supply division to Foster Medical
Supply Inc., Dedham, Mass., for $10 million.
   Temco said it will have a nonrecurring profit on the
transaction of about $1 million, or 19 cents a share, in the
second quarter. In addition, repayment of bank loans with the
sales proceeds will cut interest costs enough to increase
profit by 12 cents a share annually, the firm said.

<TEXT>
   Temco said it intends to concentrate on manufacture of
health care products. The division sold by Temco was a
wholesaler of medical products with annual sales of $25
million to $30 million.
   Separately, Temco said it had a 1989 loss from continuing
operations of $375,775, or eight cents a share, on revenue of
$23.4 million. In 1988, Temco earned $45,867, or three cents
a share, from continuing operations on revenue of $17.3
million. The firm had a loss in 1989 of $961,253, or 20 cents
a share, compared with a loss of $168,992, or 13 cents a
share.

   NEW YORK -- Gary Fisketjon, 35 years old, the editor known
for discovering Jay McInerney and other hip, young novelists,
was named to the new post of editor-at-large of Alfred A.
Knopf, a unit of Random House Inc.
   Mr. Fisketjon is leaving his post as editorial director of
Atlantic Monthly Press, a small, privately owned publisher.
He is expected to take a number of prominent authors with
him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Fisketjon actually started his publishing career at
Random House, a unit of the Newhouse family's Advance
Publications Inc., where he helped create an extremely
successful series of original paperback novels, Vintage
Contemporaries. An early title, a huge best seller, was Mr.
McInerney's "Bright Lights, Big City."
   About four years ago, Mr. Fisketjon left Random House for
Atlantic Monthly Press (taking Mr. McInerney with him), which
had just been bought by investor Carl Navarre, who is also
president and publisher. Since then, the publishing house has
built a reputation for quality fiction and nonfiction titles,
but is said to have been disappointed with its relative
dearth of bestsellers.
   Mr. Navarre declined to comment on earnings, but he said
Atlantic Monthly Press had its best sales ever in April and
is just starting to sell books through its own sales force.
"It's a blow that Gary's leaving because he's one of my best
friends," Mr. Navarre said. "And I wouldn't be surprised if
some authors went with him. But we've got a lot of other
editorial firepower here and there are a lot of things we do
that people aren't aware of, because Gary had such a high
profile."

   Hit by a decline in market demand from Britain and France,
the Anglo-Dutch truck builder DAF N.V. revised its forecast
for the first half to a loss of between 20 million guilders
and 30 million guilders ($10.6 million and $15.9 million).
   In its annual report for 1989, DAF initially predicted
profit for the 1990 first half would be lower than the
year-earlier 74 million guilders. The expected loss owes
largely to high British interest rates that are cutting
demand for trucks, DAF said, and to a volatile and weakening
pound that is hurting DAF's profitability on trucks sold in
Britain. The company didn't indicate why demand for light,
commercial trucks in France is declining.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   DAF still maintains it will show a profit for all of 1990,
though it didn't specify a sum. It said a productivity
program and stringent profit controls being put into effect
should be enough to lift the company back to profitability in
the second half.
   Overall for this year, DAF said, it expects to maintain
its commercial vehicle production at the 1989 level of
58,660.

   Spending Package,

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a $3.3 billion fiscal
1990 spending bill providing $720 million in increased aid
for Panama and Nicaragua, and warning the Soviet Union that
any new trade agreements would be jeopardized unless
accommodations are made on Lithuania.
   The Lithuania amendment, adopted 73-24, was orchestrated
by Republican conservatives in an apparent bid to stiffen the
Bush administration's stance toward Moscow, but critics
argued the measure was a gratuitous slap restating the
politically obvious. "The timing is terrible, but the
substance is reality," said one Democrat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite its opposition, the White House was left to watch
as even Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas joined in the
vote for passage.
   The action came as Secretary of State James Baker signaled
an increased willingness to bridge the administration's
differences with Congress over conditions on military aid to
El Salvador. The murder of Jesuit priests last year has
angered liberals in both houses, and House Democrats have
linked the El Salvador question to final release of the
pending funds for Panama and Nicaragua.
   In private House and Senate meetings, Mr. Baker appeared
willing to accept some conditions, and though he hopes to
push the issue into fiscal 1991, his tone encouraged hopes of
a settlement on the emotional issue.
   The spending bill, approved by a simple voice vote, goes
next to a House-Senate conference. There, despite agreement
on major foreign-aid provisions, negotiators face scores of
differences over smaller but nettlesome appropriations.
   Within Pentagon accounts, the Senate went substantially
further than the House in reallocating funds. As adopted last
night, the bill calls for an estimated $2.86 billion in
reductions and transfers from defense to help stay within
budget ceilings for the year ending Sept. 30.
   Among domestic accounts, increases are provided for food
stamps and child vaccine and education programs, as well as
conducting the current census. Apart from the Central America
package, $400 million in loan guarantees are provided to help
house Soviet Jews in Israel. The bill also frees up an
estimated $363 million in prior appropriations for the State
Department, including U.S. contributions to the United
Nations and the World Health Organization.
   The complexity of the bill surpasses that of comparable
supplemental spending measures in recent years, and the
Senate floor debate was a testing ground for the rules of
procedure set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit law. Points of
order, established under the law, are intended primarily to
protect against excessive spending. But the maneuvering this
week showed how they can be used to freeze priorities and
gain leverage regardless of the deficit impact.
   For example, Democrats appeared near success at one point
with an amendment calling for a $30 million cut from foreign
aid to help pay for accelerated investigations by the Justice
Department into the savings-and-loan scandal. The proposal,
by Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.), had no adverse impact on
the deficit, but the administration's allies nonetheless
prevailed by invoking a Gramm-Rudman rule requiring 60 votes
to waive.
   Gramm-Rudman rules were again a factor in a proposal to
paper over the short-term deficit impact of billions of
dollars in working capital needed by the Resolution Trust
Corp., the agency that merges and sells insolvent thrifts.
But here the law ran up against one of its crusty
co-sponsors, Sen. Ernest Hollings. The South Carolina
Democrat raised his own parliamentary point of order against
the planned change, and proponents were forced to back away
despite the support of the White House budget office.
   The defeat could prove significant in budget negotiations
this year because analysts estimate RTC borrowing could add
more than $30 billion to the projected deficit under
Gramm-Rudman in fiscal 1991. Already the corporation has been
authorized to borrow as much as $45.3 billion in the current
quarter. The money is intended to help manage the assets of
failed savings and loans before they are sold or merged.
   The proposed amendment sought to change Gramm-Rudman
conventions to exclude the ebb and flow of RTC working
capital from deficit calculations. But critics have
challenged the premise that the money will be eventually
restored as assets are sold. "This is a good opportunity for
our distinguished Senate to sober up," said Mr. Hollings,
and, in his best Southern drawl, he mocked the solution as
"artfully not artificially" drawn. Sen. Pete Domenici (R.,
N.M.), who was Budget Committee chairman when Gramm-Rudman
was first written, protested but admitted too, "If we'd have
known about these ins and outs when we designed Gramm-Rudman,
I think we would have fixed it."
   The Central America package, promising $420 million for
Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua, remains the
centerpiece for the administration but also a magnet for
special interest amendments by influential members. Munitions
plants in Louisiana and Mississippi are preserved despite
Pentagon objections. Favored domestic appropriations run from
compensation for sugar growers to a new fish laboratory in
Arkansas.

   NEW YORK -- Interest rates rose again at Citicorp's weekly
auction of commercial paper, in part reflecting concern by
debt-ratings agencies about the banking company's credit
quality and capital adequacy.
   The average rate rose to 8.451% at Citicorp's $50 million
weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs,
from 8.3725% at last week's sale. Last week's rate had risen
nearly 15 basis points in the wake of an announcement from
Moody's Investors Service Inc. that it was considering
lowering its debt ratings of Citicorp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Late last week, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered its senior
debt ratings for Citicorp, although commercial paper was
affirmed at single-A-1 plus.
   At the latest auction, bids totaling $405 million were
submitted for the 91-day paper. Accepted bids ranged from
8.448% to 8.454%.
   Citicorp also said that the average rate rose to 8.49% at
its $50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from
8.395% at last week's sale.
   Bids totaling $390 million were submitted. Accepted bids
ranged from 8.485% to 8.495%.
   The bank holding company will auction another $50 million
in each maturity next Tuesday.

   National Employers' Mutual General Insurance Association

world-wide in an effort to satisfy creditors.
   The move follows the company's statement over the weekend
to regulators in Victoria, Australia, that it isn't able to
continue paying claims on policies in Australia. The British
insurer, which as a mutual group isn't listed on any stock
exchange, is proposing to establish an arrangement under a
U.K. law that would allow it to sell its assets without the
pressure of a legal liquidation. Australian insurance
officials have begun legal action to liquidate the company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stanley Hallowell, the company's managing director, said
that the move was triggered by the Australian claims. He
declined to say what the company hopes to earn from the asset
sales.
   The Australian business was closed in 1985. Australian
regulators say the company has liabilities there of more than
200 million Australian dollars (US$150 million).

   U.S. Stock-Index
   3-Year Warrants

   NEW YORK -- The American Stock Exchange wants to list U.S.
stock-index warrants that would let investors bet on the
market's direction over the next three years.
   Long-term warrants are the closest thing to a popular new
product on Wall Street these days. In particular, put
warrants on Japan's Nikkei 225-stock index have attracted
wide trading interest among U.S. individuals and
institutions. Put warrants rise in value when an index
declines, and holders of Nikkei put warrants profited
handsomely on the Japanese stock market's recent plunge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far, the only stock-index warrants traded in the U.S.
have been based on Japanese or British indexes. But subject
to Securities and Exchange Commission approval, the Amex
wants to start trading three-year warrants based on the
20-stock Major Market Index.
   The new Amex warrants would be underwritten by a Wall
Street firm or commercial bank. Amex Chairman James Jones
says Salomon Brothers Inc., Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., Bankers Trust Co. and PaineWebber Inc. have
all shown interest in rolling out the new warrants.
   Market professionals said the Amex may find some interest
in its warrants, but they added that it is entering a crowded
field. The Nikkei warrants achieved much of their popularity
because it was difficult for most U.S. investors to find any
other way of betting on a Japanese market decline.
   With the U.S. stock market, however, investors already
have several ways to bet long term on the market's direction.
Most Wall Street firms already make an over-the-counter
market in long-maturity stock-index warrants and options.
   In addition, most professional traders find they can
easily simulate a long-term warrant by trading in the
stock-index futures market and "rolling" their positions into
later-maturity contracts as existing contracts near their
expiration dates. And a two-year option on Standard &amp; Poor's
500-Stock Index, traded in the Chicago commodities markets,
has attracted little interest to date.
   Nonetheless, Amex officials seem willing to take their
chances. "Traditionally, the Amex has tried to be more
flexible and innovative about its new products," says Amex
President Ken Liebler. "Some of them are hits, and some
aren't. If they aren't hits, we move on."

   WASHINGTON -- Hill &amp; Knowlton, whose Washington office
last month disclosed plans to wage an anti-abortion campaign
on behalf of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops, is
generating new controversy over another client: the
government of Turkey.
   In a letter to Hill &amp; Knowlton Chairman Robert Gray,
Armenian Assembly of America accused the New York-based
public relations firm of seeking to "censor" U.S. schoolbooks
regarding the 1915 mass deaths of Christian Armenians in
Turkey. Armenian Assembly labels the 1915 events as genocide.
Estimates of those killed range from several hundred thousand
to more than one million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under an agreement signed last June by representatives of
Hill &amp; Knowlton and the Turkish embassy, the firm agreed to
help "rectify substantial factual errors about contemporary
Turkey and Turkish history contained in secondary-school
social science textbooks."
   Tacan Ilam, press consulate for the Turkish embassy, said
Hill &amp; Knowlton wasn't asked to promote any particular
interpretation of the 1915 events in U.S. schoolbooks. He
said the Turkish embassy was responding to a number of
factual errors about Turkey in U.S. textbooks, none of them
involving the Armenian deaths. Hill &amp; Knowlton hasn't yet
recommended specific changes in textbook language, according
to its senior vice president, Chuck Pucie, but he added that
"is not to say we would not do so."

   LONDON -- Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International said it
had a net loss of $498 million in 1989, largely as a result
of $600 million in loan charges.
   The closely held bank, which had a net loss of $48 million
in 1988 after loan provisions totaling $145 million, also
confirmed that the Abu Dhabi government injected $400 million
to help it meet international loan standards. The injection,
which included the issue of new shares in the bank, boosted
Abu Dhabi's stake to 77%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier this week, it was reported that Abu Dhabi had
become the majority holder of BCCI by acquiring a 20% stake
held by Saudi Arabia's Bin-Mahfouz family. Even before the
acquisition and cash injection, the emirate and its ruling
family members represented the largest block of shareholders
in the bank, which is based in Luxembourg.
   BCCI said it had operating profit before loan provisions
of $224 million, up from $192 million in 1988. It added that
total capital after the cash injection was $1.48 billion, up
from $1.42 billion at the end of 1988. Total assets were
$23.5 billion, up from $20.6 billion.
   BCCI didn't disclose full 1989 operating results. Its
brief statement followed reports that it would announce sharp
losses for the year and possibly sweeping organizational
changes.

   NEW YORK -- In Hollywood's latest foray into Broadway,
Warner Bros. agreed to make a film version of Andrew Lloyd
Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera."
   The subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. said it signed an
agreement with the British composer to produce a movie
version of the hit show, which started in London and has been
doing sell-out business in New York since opening here two
years ago. "Phantom" is also playing in Toronto and Los
Angeles and opens next month in Chicago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Warner and a spokesman for Mr. Webber declined to disclose
financial terms of the production agreement, or what the
projected budget of the movie will be, though like the stage
play it is expected to be a lavish production. Mr. Webber
will produce the film, which will star the original stage
stars Michael Crawford and Mr. Webber's wife, Sarah
Brightman. The movie will be directed by Joel Schumacher,
whose recent credits include Warner's teen vampire movie "The
Lost Boys."
   The agreement to produce "Phantom" is the latest in a
number of recent moves by Hollywood studios to make movies
out of hit Broadway shows. A new show that started
off-Broadway, "Prelude to a Kiss," recently sparked a heated
bidding war for movie rights among studios; News Corp.'s 20th

   MANUFACTURING GREW in April for the first time in 11
months, purchasing managers said. But construction spending
fell 1.4% in March, the first decline this year. Both
manufacturing and construction have been hurt by the Fed's
efforts to battle inflation with high rates.

   Mitsubishi
   Takes Over
   Rental Firm

<LP>
   For the first time, a Japanese auto maker has taken a page
from Detroit's marketing book by aligning itself with a U.S.
car-rental company.
   Mitsubishi Motors Corp., whose U.S. sales are growing
rapidly despite its lack of a distinct image, agreed to buy a
majority stake in Value Rent-a-Car Inc. of Deerfield Beach,
Fla. Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed, but Value's
management will retain a minority interest in the company and
continue to run it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Value's fleet of up to 20,000 cars pales next to that of
industry leader Hertz Corp., which has about 150,000 cars in
the U.S. But Mitsubishi's move is significant because it
locks in a source of rental-fleet sales at a time when most
major car-rental companies are affiliated with one of
Detroit's auto makers.
   "The big reasons for doing this are sales volume and
exposure to consumers," says Richard S. Recchia, who heads
Mitsubishi's U.S. sales arm. "We provide only 10% of Value's
fleet now, but that will go up to 85% in the near future."
Mitsubishi may, however, reduce its sales to other rental
companies, Mr. Recchia adds.
   By using Value as a mostly captive customer, Mitsubishi
will be following the lead of Detroit's Big Three auto
makers. They have consolidated control of the nation's major
rental companies in recent years by lending them money,
investing in them or buying them outright.
   Ford Motor Co. has poured cash into Hertz and Budget Rent
A Car Corp. General Motors Corp. has done the same with Avis
Inc. and National Car Rental System Inc. Chrysler Corp. owns
Thrifty Rent-A-Car System Inc. and Snappy Car Rental Inc.
   It isn't clear whether other Japanese auto makers will
follow Mitsubishi's lead. Toyota Motor Corp. has considered
buying a rental company and scouted possible candidates, but
hasn't found any to its liking. The major Japanese companies
have strong brand images in the U.S., and thus don't need
additional consumer exposure as much as Mitsubishi does.
   In Mitsubishi's case, controlling a rental fleet should
help the company's expansion plans in the U.S. Value rents
cars in Sun Belt cities to vacationers and tourists who --
unlike business people -- rent cars for a week or more at a
time. Mitsubishi views the rentals as extended test drives
and hopes they will help to overcome the brand's problem: low
consumer awareness in a crowded car market.
   "We're suffering from that," acknowledges Mr. Recchia.
"The fact is that we started in the U.S. 20 years later than
Honda and Toyota did. Having Value Rent-a-car will help."
   Some of the smaller Japanese car companies have been
struggling in the U.S., but Mitsubishi is an exception.
Overall U.S. car and truck sales dropped slightly in the
first quarter, but Mitsubishi's sales jumped 90%.
   The company hopes to sell more than 200,000 vehicles in
the U.S. this year. That would be less than three month's
work for Toyota Motor Corp., but it still would represent a
big jump from the 150,000 vehicles that Mitsubishi sold last
year.
   Some of the increase reflects a loosening of Mitsubishi's
longtime ties to Chrysler. Mitsubishi didn't sell cars under
its own name in the U.S. until 1983. Instead, it sold them
through Chrysler; they included such models as the Dodge Colt
and Plymouth Vista. In 1988, Chrysler sold nearly 190,000
Mitsubishi-made vehicles as Chrysler products.
   But last year that number dropped to 140,000 cars and
trucks, and this year it may fall below 100,000. As the U.S.
car market has softened, Chrysler has concentrated on selling
vehicles that it makes itself to shore up its flagging
production schedules.
   This has opened the door for Mitsubishi to boost its sales
under its own brand. Mitsubishi, like all Japanese car
makers, has a quota on its vehicle shipments to the U.S.
Every Mitsubishi car that Chrysler doesn't take is one more
that Mitsubishi can try to sell on its own -- which it's
doing, much to Chrysler's chagrin.
   What's more, Mitsubishi now has its own production base in
the U.S.: the Diamond-Star Motors plant in Illinois, a joint
venture with Chrysler, which opened in 1988. The plant makes
the Mitsubishi Eclipse, a sporty subcompact that's been a big
hit for the company. (Nearly identical models are sold by
Chrysler as the Plymouth Laser and Eagle Talon.)
   All this is providing Mitsubishi with enough cars to
sharply expand its U.S. dealership network. The company now
has 430 U.S. dealers, up from 246 in January 1989.
"Mitsubishi has dramatically increased its number of dealers
in the U.S.," says Christopher Cedergren of J.D. Power &amp;
Associates, an auto-consulting firm. "Also helping is an
aggressive product strategy."
   This fall, Mitsubishi will introduce the 3000GT, a $31,000
high-tech sports car designed to build the company's image
and compete with the Nissan 300ZX and Porsche 911. And next
spring, the company will launch a new version of the Montero
(its Jeep-like vehicle), two new minivans and a new Sigma, a
near-luxury sedan that sells for close to $20,000. The
company will spend some $100 million on advertising this
year, up 30% from last year, when it began using network
television for the first time.
   Despite all this, Mitsubishi isn't aiming to join the
front rank of Japanese car companies in the U.S. Even if
Mitsubishi hits its goal of selling 300,000 vehicles a year
in the U.S. by 1993, it will still trail Mazda Motor Corp.,
which sold nearly 342,000 vehicles to Americans last year.
   "You have to be realistic," says Mr. Recchia. "Right now,
the competition in each market segment is pretty intense.
Some awfully good products are out there."

   WASHINGTON -- After a halt of more than two years to
resolve safety and management problems, the Energy Department
tentatively plans to resume producing a key component of
nuclear bombs by late December or early January.
   When the government in 1988 closed down its tritium
production reactors at the department's Savannah River
facility in South Carolina, fears were raised that the
nation's nuclear weapons arsenal would be weakened. Tritium,
a perishable radioactive gas, is used to enhance the power of
nuclear bombs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One reactor at Savannah River is scheduled to begin
low-power testing in December, with production to resume soon
thereafter. All three reactors at the facility are planned to
go back in production by the end of next year. The restart
plans, which have been delayed, are contingent on an
assessment of environmental implications.
   "Until I am assured that the environment, safety and
health considerations have been satisfactorily addressed, I
will not approve restart of the reactors at Savannah River,"
Energy Secretary James Watkins said.
   Improvements already completed or planned at Savannah
River, which is run by Westinghouse Electric Corp., include
increased training for employees and changes designed to make
operations at Savannah River more like those at commercial
nuclear facilities.

   Modest Profit
   For 1st Quarter

   Many Analysts Estimated
   Only Break-Even Result
   Was Possible for Period

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Despite sharp production cuts and
slumping sales, Chrysler Corp. rode cost-cutting savings and
financial-services gains to first-quarter profit that
surpassed many analysts' expectations.
   The No. 3-ranked U.S. auto maker reported first-quarter
net income plunged 80% to $71 million, or 32 cents a share,
from $351 million, or $1.50 a share, a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most analysts had expected Chrysler would only break even
in the quarter because slow sales and plant idlings sliced
January production by 41%. Investors reacted to the news by
bidding up Chrysler's stock 75 cents a share to $15.25, on
volume of 1.2 million shares, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Chrysler said it eked out a puny $8 million pretax and $5
million after-tax earnings from its automotive operations in
the quarter, despite weak output. The reason: Cost-cutting
measures slashed expenses about $200 million. That was
greater than anticipated under the company's previously
announced $1.5 billion cost-cutting program.
   "We were virtually out of business in January with shut
factories and everybody writing rebate checks," said Robert
S. Miller Jr., Chrysler's executive vice president and chief
financial officer. "It was awful, but we think it's
significant that we could get back in the black even though
our factory vehicle sales were so much lower." Chrysler said
its world-wide factory unit sales dropped 26% to 493,612
vehicles in the first period.
   The bulk of Chrysler's profit came from its Chrysler
Financial Corp. subsidiary, which had record first-quarter
earnings of $89 million compared with $65 million the year
earlier.
   Mr. Miller attributed Chrysler Financial's improvement to
growing auto-loan volume and continued gains by the unit's
commercial and consumer-lending operations. Because of
Chrysler Financial's preferred stock and its lower tax rate,
about $23 million of its earnings aren't passed along to the
parent.
   Wall Street's positive reaction to Chrysler's earnings
news broke a two-week slide that saw the auto maker's share
price fall 13%, or $2.25, to wind up at $14.50 a share
Monday. Since Jan. 1, Chrysler's stock value has fallen 23%.
Analysts blamed the drop on fears that Chrysler might cut its
dividend as a result of its weakened condition and the U.S.
car market's decline.
   Chrysler's market problems are far from over. The
company's U.S. car and light truck sales continued to sag in
April, and some of its core products, including the Jeep
Cherokee sport utility vehicle and the popular minivans, are
under increasing competitive and pricing pressure.
   But investors' worst fears apparently were eased by the
first-quarter earnings, which demonstrated that the company
is able to return a profit, albeit marginal, despite sharply
reduced sales volume. Some analysts said they now plan to
boost their estimates of Chrysler's full-year earnings.
   Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds,
raised his 1990 Chrysler estimate to $1.50 a share from $1.
Wendy Needham, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said the benefits of Chrysler's cost-cutting program led
her to increase her 1990 estimate to $1.65 a share from $1.10
and her 1991 estimate to $3.75 to $2 a share.
   "Everyone was surprised that Chrysler says it made profits
with auto operations," Ms. Needham said. "Anyone who says
they weren't surprised is lying."

   WASHINGTON -- The North American subsidiary of Trusthouse
Forte PLC has agreed to buy the Watergate Hotel in
Washington, D.C. from the British Coal Board, a pension fund
that owns the 237-room luxury hotel. Terms of the purchase
aren't final, a Trusthouse Forte spokesman said.
   Trusthouse Forte, a British hotel and catering company,
said the hotel recently underwent a $13 million renovation,
and an additional $5 million improvement plan is scheduled.
Financing for the purchase will be arranged in Japan by Nikko
Securities Co. International.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The purchase would include the hotel and health spa on
about an acre of land, and not the apartments and other
portions of the Watergate complex, the spokesman said.
Average room rates at the hotel range between $200 and $300 a
night.
   The Watergate lent its name to the 1972 break-in and
electronic bugging incident at the nearby headquarters of the
Democratic National Committee, which eventually culminated in
the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.
   The British Coal Board has sold off most of its U.S.
property portfolio, which it amassed over the past decade
when the real estate market was generally stronger.

   ROCKY HILL, Conn -- Ames Department Stores Inc., which
filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, may be short on cash. But it's
proving generous to Stephen Pistner, its new co-chairman and
chief executive officer.
   Yesterday, Ames received approval from a U.S. bankruptcy
court judge in Manhattan to pay Mr. Pistner more than $2
million for the first year of his services. That includes a
signing bonus of $500,000 to be paid over the first six
months and an annual salary of $1.5 million. In addition Mr.
Pistner gets reimbursed for travel, legal and other
incidental expenses.
</LP>

   Creditors, many of whom were in the court, apparently
approved of the new leader's salary. "If he's the right man,
so be it," commented Wilbur Ross, a senior managing director
for Rothschild's Inc., financial adviser to a number of bond
holders and creditors. "The task at hand is great and for a
job well done that would be small price to pay."
   Mr. Pistner's appointment was approved at least on a
temporary basis by the bankruptcy court. The action enables
Mr. Pistner to serve in the two positions and hold
discussions with the retailer's creditors through May 19.
Though yesterday's approval is only temporary, court
observers said that a permanent approval is likely to follow.

   DALLAS -- Texas Employers Insurance Association, once the
largest writer of workers' compensation insurance policies in
Texas, was placed in conservatorship by the state insurance
commissioner.
   The appointment of a conservator "will enable {the
insurer} to wind down its affairs in an orderly manner,"
Commissioner A.W. Pogue said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Texas Employers reported assets of $307.3 million and
liabilities of $297.9 million as of March 31. The liabilities
don't include about $57.6 million in deferred assessments due
the state's assigned-risk pool, the fund created to provide
coverage for employers in hazardous businesses who couldn't
obtain insurance elsewhere. The fund is financed by insurers
based on their shares of the Texas workers' compensation
market.
   Texas Employers cited its liabilities for the
assigned-risk pool when it stopped issuing new workers'
compensation policies Oct. 1. But the company was unable to
reverse its losses and was placed under supervision by the
state insurance commissioner on March 6, a less stringent
measure than conservatorship.
   Under conservatorship, payment of Texas Employers'
policyholder claims will take precedence, and a partial
payment to the assigned-risk pool is possible in two-to-four
years, the commissioner said.

   Interest Rate Rise
   Has Taken Toll

   NEW YORK -- The rise in interest rates this year has taken
its toll on utility stocks, which have given back gains made
in the past 12 months.
   The Dow Jones Utilities Average, which closed above 200
for the first time in May 1989, is now approaching that level
again -- but by heading lower rather than higher.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now some analysts, saying a turnaround in rates may be on
the horizon, think utility shares may be poised for a
recovery. "We've reached a pretty good buy point here," says
Edward J. Tirello, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
who notes he reiterated buy recommendations on 11 utility
stocks and recommended nine others last week.
   Utility stock prices have fallen further since the
recommendations were issued, but yesterday the average rose
1.01 to 204.10 even as the bond market declined modestly. Mr.
Tirello says he is confident that the worst is over for the
group. For prices to rise, however, "what we need to see is a
perception" that rates are going to head lower, he says.
   Utility stocks are often viewed as a substitute for
fixed-income investments because of their high dividend
yields. Higher rates make them less competitive with those
securities.
   The utilities average, composed of 15 issues, peaked Dec.
15 at an all-time high of 235.98 as Treasury bond yields
stood at their lowest level since March 1987. The benchmark
30-year bond yielded about 7.8% at the time.
   Since then, rates have been climbing. The yield on the
long-term Treasury bond, which ended last year at 7.97%, now
stands at 9.03%. As rates have fallen, the utilities average
has fallen commensurately -- down 13.16% this year, compared
with a 3.06% drop in the industrial average.
   "Utilities are clearly leading the way on the downside,"
says Chester Pado, director of technical research at
Jefferies &amp; Co., Los Angeles. Mr. Pado says the utilities
average could bottom out at from 193 to 195 if rates remain
at their current levels or move slightly higher, which he
considers "a safe bet."
   Barry Abramson, a utility analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, says his firm is projecting that yields on
long-term Treasury issues will decline to 8% by year-end.
"This would be a good time to buy utility stocks," he says.
   Similarly, Mr. Tirello of Shearson cites his firm's view
that rates "are starting to peak" as the reason for his
recommendations of utility issues last week. "I think the
prospects look pretty good" for the group, Mr. Tirello says,
especially for utilities that have excess generating
capacity, successful diversification or low-priced power. He
predicts that the Dow utilities average will "bounce up"
after testing the 200 level.

   LONDON -- Media baron Robert Maxwell, after lowering his
lofty sights for a pan-European daily newspaper, is plunging
ahead next week with an expensive gamble on a weekly version.
   The European is to hit newsstands May 11 as a 64-page
weekend broadsheet aimed at affluent, mobile Europeans. The
English-language paper, selling across Europe for roughly 50
pence per issue (about 82 cents), will make extensive use of
color and splashy graphics and will vaguely resemble Gannett
Co.'s USA Today.

   The 67-year-old publisher is pulling out all stops on his
most gutsy publishing foray. He intends to spend #10 million
($16.4 million) this year to promote the paper in Britain and
on the Continent -- and may shell out more to deliver a
million copies free to households in the United Kingdom. He
said he has committed an initial #25 million to the entire
project. If needed, "we will put in another #25 million. The
European newspaper will be around as long as Europe is
around."
   The European should sell 300,000 copies a week and reach a
break-even point within three years, Mr. Maxwell predicted.
"We wouldn't be surprised if we broke even in year No. 2," he
added.
   But analysts, competitors and advertisers remain skeptical
of the European's chances for success. The latest Maxwell
venture, coming after 2 1/2 years of false starts, looks
highly risky. Two-thirds of the European's initial
circulation of 225,000 copies is expected to come from
Britain, a highly saturated newspaper market where ad
spending is dropping and where Mr. Maxwell's last newspaper
enterprise flopped spectacularly in 1987.
   The European "won't work," said Hugh Stephenson, a
journalism professor at City University here. "There isn't a
market for it" among readers or advertisers, Mr. Stephenson
added. "I think it {the European} is 10 years before its
time."
   He and other newspaper-industry watchers figure Mr.
Maxwell may end up spending between #50 million and #75
million before he reaps a profit from the European. "He is
going to have to throw in a lot of money," said Stephen Rau,
advertising director of USA Today's international edition,
which claims daily European circulation of 38,000 copies
after a four-year effort.
   Mr. Maxwell is tackling Europe's increasingly crowded
field of English-language papers. In Britain alone, two
so-called quality Sunday papers have sprung up since
September, sparking a circulation war with the three existing
publications.
   The rivalry is equally fierce across the Continent.
Besides USA Today, London's Guardian newspaper publishes a
20,000-copy edition on the Continent that competes with
Pearson PLC's Financial Times, which said it sells 57,858
copies of its Continental version. Other English-language
dailies in Europe include The Wall Street Journal/Europe,
published by Dow Jones &amp; Co., and the International Herald
Tribune, published by New York Times Co., Washington Post Co.
and Whitney Communications Corp.
   Advertising-agency executives like the sophisticated look
of the European's dummy version but report that many
companies refuse to advertise in the new paper. "It's more of
a case of wait and see what happens," especially as most
major corporations already have committed their pan-European
ad budgets for 1990, said Catriona Wilson of ad agency Leo
Burnett.
   Martin Vernon, who joined the fledgling paper as
advertising director 10 days ago, said the maiden issue has
sold out its 20 pages of advertising. Advertisers mainly are
big airlines, banks and drink makers lured by hefty
discounts. He wants the European to boost that relatively low
proportion of ad pages. Unfortunately, "we're going into one
of the worst advertising recessions in recent times," he
said.

   NEW YORK -- A stronger-than-expected economic report
triggered a sell-off in the bond market.
   Bonds got off to a strong start in early trading, with
prices rising as much as 3/8 point, or $3.75 for a bond with
a $1,000 face amount. But the gains vanished after the
National Association of Purchasing Management said its index
of business activity rose in April to the highest level in a
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The index was 50.2% in April, up from 48.8% in March. An
index reading above 50% indicates the manufacturing sector of
the economy is expanding, while a reading below 50% indicates
it is contracting. The April index was the first showing
above 50% since April 1989.
   After its release, some market players referred to the
NAPM report as the "napalm" report because "it blew the
market away," said F. Ward McCarthy Jr., a managing director
at Stone &amp; McCarthy Associates.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell as much as 1/2
point after the report was released, but it staged a partial
recovery later in the day and ended 3/8 point lower.
Investment-grade corporate bonds ended with moderate losses,
while municipal bonds were mixed. Junk bonds, which fell
sharply on Monday, were unchanged to moderately higher.
   In the mortgage-backed securities market, some bonds were
buoyed by unusually heavy issuance of real estate mortgage
investment conduits, which are created with mortgage
securities. Investment firms created five Remics yesterday
totaling more than $2.2 billion, one of the heaviest one-day
totals in the seven-year history of the market. And there was
talk that at least one more Remic would be issued today.
   In the Treasury market, analysts said prices also were
hurt by rising commodity prices, which fanned inflation
fears. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures
prices, which includes 21 commodities, rose more than 2 1/2
points in morning trading. The gains were trimmed later in
the day, and the CRB index ended 0.65 point higher at 246.46.
   On the economic calendar for release today is the March
index of leading economic indicators, last month's factory
orders and the latest edition of the Federal Reserve's "beige
book." The beige book is a summary of economic activity
prepared for use at the central bank's next Federal Open
Market Committee meeting.
   But the next most significant piece of economic news comes
Friday when the Labor Department releases the April
employment report. The data are expected to set the market
tone for next week's Treasury refunding, analysts and traders
say.
   The Treasury will unveil details of the quarterly auction
this afternoon. Most analysts expect a record-size refunding
package of between $30.5 billion to $31 billion, up from the
$30 billion in the previous refunding in February.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   After suffering a sizable setback Monday, the junk bond
market stabilized in brisk trading activity.
   "There's been a reasonable amount of activity across the
board," said David Feinman, a junk bond trader at Los
Angeles-based Jeffries &amp; Co. Even when prices were falling on
Monday, trading activity was far above normal. "The last two
days, we've been back in business."
   Among the market movers were junk bonds of Ames Department
Stores Inc., Trump Plaza Funding and American Standard Inc.
   Trump Plaza Funding's 12 7/8% bonds, which tumbled 3 1/2
points Monday, gained 1/2 to close at 82. The gains came in
spite of reports that robust business at Trump's Taj Mahal
casino appears to be hurting Trump Plaza and Trump Castle
casinos. Although the bonds would tend to trade lower on such
news, junk bond traders said dealers were snapping the
securities up because they have reached levels considered
relatively cheap. Ever since Friday's news that casino and
real estate developer Donald Trump may sell the Trump shuttle
and other major assets, some Trump casino bonds have fallen
nearly 10 points.
   Ames' 13% senior subordinated reset notes due in 1999,
jumped two points to end at 25 1/4. Active buying by vulture
funds and investment firms specializing in distressed
securities have buoyed Ames bonds ever since the retailer
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code last month.
   American Standard's 12 7/8% senior subordinated debentures
due in 2000, which shed a point Monday, were up 1/4 point at
94 1/4.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Heavy issuance of Remic offerings buoyed Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association
securities.
   The largest of the $2.2 billion of Remics offered
yesterday was a $750.1 million issue from Fannie Mae backed
by its 9 1/2% securities and underwritten by Bear, Stearns &amp;
Co., the leading underwriter in derivative mortgage-backed
securities this year.
   There were two large Remics backed by Government National
Mortgage Association securities, but those issues had been
rumored since late last week and had little market impact.
   In trading, Freddie Mac 9 1/2% securities finished at 95
30/32, down 1/32, and Fannie Mae 9 1/2% securities ended at
96 15/32, also down 1/32. But Ginnie Mae 9% securities for
May delivery ended at 93 11/32, down 8/32.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury, Agency Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 94 14/32 to yield
9.03%, compared with 94 26/32 to yield 8.989% on Monday. The
latest 10-year notes ended at 96 10/32 to yield 9.05%,
compared with 96 17/32 to yield 9.02%.
   Short-term interest rates rose. The discount rate on
three-month bills rose to 7.94% for a bond-equivalent yield
of 8.19%, while the rate on six-month bills rose to 8.04% for
a bond-equivalent yield of 8.48%.
   In the agency market, the Federal National Mortgage
Association priced a total of $1 billion of four-year and
10-year debentures. Fannie Mae said its $400 million offering
of debentures due May 10, 1994, was priced to yield 9.30%,
and its $600 million of debentures due May 10, 2000, was
priced to yield 9.80%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Actively traded municipal bonds were narrowly mixed in
late trading, with some issues off as much as 1/4 point while
others were up as much as 3/8 point.
   Short-covering aided issues at the start of the uninspired
session, but some municipals later weakened along with
Treasurys.
   In a short sale, investors sell borrowed stock and hope to
profit by later buying an equal number of shares at a lower
price to replace what was borrowed.
   With speculation about possible tightening by the Federal
Reserve continuing to grow, municipal bonds may weaken in the
near term if Treasurys keep slumping, market participants
said.
   Among new issues priced was $159.4 million of Minneapolis
Housing Redevelopment Authority health care system revenue
bonds priced by a Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. group.
   In secondary activity, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue of 2018 fell 1/4 point to 95 bid, to yield 7.61%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government bond market ended weaker as
bearish sentiment continued to grow.
   "People are adjusting their positions," said a dealer at a
Japanese securities firm. "Instead of holding long positions
{in this weak market}, it is better to hold short positions."
   Dealers noted, however, that trading activity has been
light because of the holiday-shortened week. Japan's
financial markets were closed Monday and will close again
tomorrow and Friday.
   Japan's 10-year bond fell 0.14 point to 85.69 to yield
7.435% yesterday.
   In Britain, bonds edged up on the latest quarterly survey
by the Confederation of British Industry, a trade
association.
   The poll of 1,232 firms found expectations that
manufacturing employment would fall despite a "slight
increase" in output in the next four months. It also
indicated that business confidence had declined further in
response to a drop in domestic demand and capacity
utilization.
   But activity was muted because of holidays in other
European countries. Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due
2003/2007 rose 3/8 to 94 1/2 to yield 12.53%.
   Markets in West Germany, France and several other European
countries were closed in observance of May Day.

   Pound Advances Ahead of British Vote;
   U.S. Unit Is Sidelined in Thin Dealings

   NEW YORK -- The pound rose against the dollar, mark and
other currencies in a surprising show of strength ahead of
this week's British parliamentary elections, which are
expected to result in losses for the ruling Conservative
Party.
   Relatively strong activity in pound dealings was the most
noticeable example of a trend toward non-dollar transactions,
as the U.S. unit idled against the mark and yen in trading
bands close to 1.68 marks and 158.80 yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Participants said tests of both higher and lower dollar
levels against the mark and yen early in the New York day
failed to spark decisive movement in the U.S. currency,
largely because of unusual market thinness following a
holiday Monday in Japan and the observance of May Day in
Europe.
   In the vacuum left by the dollar, sterling was the star
performer of the day, making strong gains against the mark
and rising modestly against its U.S. counterpart in defiance
of widespread predictions that the pound would fall ahead of
tomorrow's parliamentary elections in Britain.
   The pound's surprising strength stemmed from confidence
that the British government won't relax the country's high
interest rates even in the event of a strong opposition
showing tomorrow, traders said.
   "It's a foregone conclusion" that the Conservatives will
emerge from the local elections with some losses, and the
pound's resilience suggests the market has already discounted
the election results, said Raimund Sargent, vice president
and senior dealer at Shawmut Bank of Boston N.A.
   Traders said they expect the dollar to begin moving up
once some depth returns to the market today.
   "If the market (in New York) was at full strength, we
would take the dollar higher," said Gabriel Grippo, senior
foreign exchange trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New
York. Mr. Grippo cited a surprisingly good reading of 50.2%
from the April survey of the National Association of
Purchasing Managers, well above expectations of 48.9%.
   The figure suggests an expansion is taking place in the
U.S. manufacturing sector after 11 months of declines in the
NAPM survey. The number from March's survey was 48.8%.
   Other participants agreed with Mr. Grippo's assessment of
market conditions, saying the positive meaning of the NAPM
survey hadn't been compromised by other factors such as a
1.4% drop in construction spending during March, the steepest
monthly fall since a 1.5% drop in February 1989. March's
level was still 3.8% above the level one year earlier.
February's construction spending was revised to a rise of
3.2% from an increase of 2.6%.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6808 marks, up from 1.6796 marks late Monday, and at
158.83 yen, down from 158.90 yen late Monday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6445, up from $1.6408 late Monday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 158.45 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 158.90 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6815
marks.
   The pound surged against the mark after reaching 2.75
marks in New York, where technical buying came in to boost it
above 2.76 marks. The British unit finished New York trading
around 2.7624 marks, above 2.7552 marks late Monday in New
York.
   The mark was weakened slightly against the dollar and
other currencies because of continued uncertainty over the
effects of German monetary unification, traders said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $370 an ounce, up $1.60. Estimated volume
was a moderate 2.7 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong early Wednesday, gold was quoted at $370.55
an ounce.

   MONTREAL -- Domtar Inc. halved its quarterly dividend to
6.25 Canadian cents (5.37 cents U.S.) and reported a
first-quarter loss from continuing operations.
   The reduced dividend is payable June 15 to stock of record
May 15.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I would be less than honest if I said I exude confidence"
about Domtar's short-term prospects, James Smith, chairman,
president and chief executive officer, said after the annual
meeting.
   "We don't really see any signs of a near-term turnaround"
in the company's paper and building-products markets, Mr.
Smith said, adding that Domtar wouldn't "be unhappy" with a
break-even second quarter.
   Montreal-based Domtar reported a first-quarter loss from
continuing operations of C$10 million, or 15 Canadian cents a
share, compared with profit from continuing operations of
C$20 million, or 19 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales fell to C$611 million from C$623 million a year
earlier.
   Net income in the latest period was C$20 million, or 19
Canadian cents a share, including a C$23 million after-tax
gain from the sale of most of Domtar's salt business. A year
ago, net was C$26 million, or 26 Canadian cents a share.
   Investors "shouldn't have been surprised" by the dividend
cut, said Raymond Kilroy, an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson
Deacon Inc. Mr. Kilroy said Domtar "will have to struggle" to
post a profit for the full year.
   Domtar is the third major Canadian forest-products concern
to cut its dividend in recent months. Last December,
Abitibi-Price Inc. halved its quarterly dividend to 12.5
Canadian cents. Two weeks ago, Canadian Pacific Forest
Products Ltd. slashed its quarterly payout 69% to 20 Canadian
cents.
   Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Domtar closed at $10.25, off 25 cents.

   RJR Nabisco Junk Bonds Present Conundrum
   For Would-Be Profiteers in the Volatile Paper

   With the junk bond market in the doldrums, junk bond
players have developed a new pastime: figuring out how to
profit from RJR Nabisco's $6 billion high-yield-headache.
   RJR is supposed to reset the interest rate on $6 billion
of its debt by next May so that the two bond issues will
trade at 100 cents on the dollar. That's a tough problem for
bonds that have been trading as low as 57 cents on the dollar
this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prices of some RJR bonds have risen from their deeply
depressed levels of earlier this year amid speculation about
what RJR and its parent, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, will do.
Even after the run-up, several junk-bond analysts are
recommending the RJR issues, betting that the combination of
RJR's strong cash flow and KKR's financial engineering skills
will drive the bonds still higher within a year.
   These particular RJR bonds are highly volatile and aren't
for the faint of heart: They are two separate issues of
"payment in kind" bonds, which pay interest in more bonds,
not cash. One of the two PIKs, which can be converted into
25% of RJR's common equity in 1993, is especially "high
octane stuff," warns Dirk M. Van Doren, a junk bond analyst
with McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei.
   With the bonds now trading at around 67 cents on the
dollar, they would require an interest rate of 20% or more to
cause them to trade at par, their full face amount. Paying
such a high rate would be costly for RJR and would probably
undermine investor confidence in RJR's other debt issues.
   As a result, KKR has had two investment banking firms,
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, hard at work on potential
solutions to the reset problem. And analysts, in turn, are
trying to figure out what KKR's advisers might devise.
   "We've identified 15 scenarios and most are favorable to
KKR, RJR and bondholders," says Sam DeRosa-Farag, a First
Boston bond analyst.
   If RJR can get its two issues of PIK reset bonds close to
par by next May, the returns for investors will be
impressive. The RJR subordinated exchange debentures of 2007
closed at 66 7/8 yesterday, indicating a yield of about 20%
plus a potential price appreciation of 49% if the bonds hit
par.
   The convertible debentures due 2009 closed at 80 1/4
yesterday, but that price includes about 15 months' worth of
accrued interest. Derek A. Jones, a high-yield analyst with
J.P. Morgan Securities, estimates that the principal amount
reflected in that price is also about 67. With the added
attraction of convertibility into common stock, Mr. Jones
says he favors the debentures due 2009 because he believes
they're cheap relative to those due 2007.
   Several analysts, including Mr. DeRosaFarag, have
suggested that RJR might sell its Planters/Lifesavers unit
for at least $1.5 billion and use the proceeds to reduce
senior debt or buy back some of the PIK reset bonds. Buying
back a significant amount of the bonds would require
permission from RJR's bank lenders, but that isn't viewed as
a major stumbling block.
   But RJR's management wants to keep its remaining major
businesses, according to people familiar with KKR. Although
an asset sale in excess of $1 billion remains a possibility,
it is very low on the list of options, these people say.
   Another set of scenarios revolves around a possible
exchange offer, in which RJR might ask bondholders to accept
a change in the terms of the bonds such as the reset
provision, in exchange for a sweetener such as a drop in the
price at which the bonds can convert into equity or an
increased share of the equity. Why not simply swap new PIK
bonds? Last summer after the RJR bonds were issued, Congress
changed the tax law so that interest paid on PIK junk bonds
can't be deducted for corporate income tax purposes. Interest
on new junk bonds must be paid in cash or it can't be
deducted.
   A third group of scenarios involves a partial buy-back of
the bonds either by RJR or KKR. RJR would need its banks'
permission. Although KKR could conceivably use money from its
leveraged buy-out fund to buy some of the RJR convertible
bonds, that investment would probably drag down the fund's
overall return. Rumors that RJR or KKR has been buying back
bonds have helped drive up the prices of RJR junk bonds in
recent weeks, but those rumors are unfounded, people familiar
with RJR say. RJR and KKR decline to comment.
   Another option, which undoubtedly appeals to KKR, is to do
nothing more than allow the bond market to watch RJR's
improving cash flow. In the first quarter, for example,
operating income before amortization of trademarks and good
will increased 43% to $754 million from $526 million a year
earlier. Says Mr. Van Doren: "If you get another two quarters
like the first quarter they had -- they're not boomers, but
they're fairly strong -- the market starts to feel that
they're a fairly good credit and they can stand that debt,
and the price of the bonds goes up. If they can get the bonds
to 90 cents on the dollar, they can reset them."
   One factor working in RJR's favor -- and perhaps against
bondholders -- is that the bonds, once reset, don't have to
trade at par to fulfill the terms of the bond indenture. RJR
simply must obtain opinions from two investment banking firms
that the reset interest rate would have caused the bonds to
trade at par on a particular day.
   Analysts and junk bond investors believe that the supply
of RJR PIK bonds far exceeds current demand for such issues.
And even for speculative investors, there's a tax problem.
Holders of PIK bonds must pay taxes on the interest that's
building up, even though the interest isn't paid in cash.

   Street Courts Gurus in Newly Hot Private Placement

   NEW YORK -- Wanted: Private-placement specialists. Good
pay. Immediate openings. Bright future.
   Welcome to Wall Street's latest bull market. The expected
surge in privately placed securities under the Securities and
Exchange Commission's new Rule 144a has made
private-placement specialists one of the hottest commodities
around.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This is big news at a time when most of the securities
industry is fast contracting and many investment banks are
looking for ways to lop off jobs. Since the October 1987
stock market crash, nearly 45,000 securities employees have
been dismissed nationwide.
   But the SEC's new rule, which is expected to make it
easier for corporations and institutional investors to sell
and trade bonds and stocks in the $170 billion
private-placement market, is a bright spot for securities
firms scrambling for ways to generate fees. And it couldn't
come at a better time: In the first quarter, investment
banking revenue at many major investment banks was down 20%
or more from year-earlier levels.
   The result: a bidding war and defections from the
private-placement departments at major securities firms. In
the past several weeks alone, the heads of the
private-placement groups at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., American
Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. and
Prudential Insurance Co. of America's Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. have bolted for greener pastures. Other
securities firms and banks have reshuffled their
private-placement desks, and securities industry executives
expect further moves in the next few weeks.
   Wall Street executive recruiters are busily trying to
match up private-placement specialists with securities firms
dangling big salaries. Gary Goldstein, president of Whitney
Group, a New York executive search firm, says: "Everything
relating to private placements is increasingly in demand.
This is a very hot area right now."
   Joan Zimmerman, executive vice president at GZ Stephens
Inc., a New York executive search firm, said, "Wall Street
has learned that private-placement people can be revenue
generators."
   The new SEC rule, which went into effect earlier this
week, could transform the way many companies raise capital.
This is because it will make it easier for companies to
sidestep many of the registration requirements of public
offerings and sell debt or stock directly to big
institutional investors through private placements. The SEC
rule also is expected to increase the ease of trading in the
secondary, or resale, market.
   The moves at big securities firms have come with dizzying
speed. Last week, Merrill Lynch officials were stunned by the
sudden departure of Jerome P. Greene, for nine years its head
of private placements, and Benjamin J. Sullivan Jr., a
managing director, who both joined Benedetto, Gartland &amp;
Greene Inc., a small investment banking boutique. Philip B.
Pool Jr., a managing director in Merrill Lynch's
private-placement group, also had planned to leave with
Messrs. Greene and Sullivan, but was persuaded to stay at the
last moment with promises of expanded responsibility, Merrill
Lynch officials said.
   Merrill Lynch nevertheless recently lost two other
private-placement specialists, Luke Bowes, who moved to
Prudential-Bache, and Jay Applegate, who departed to Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., a Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. unit. At the
same time, Merrill Lynch has beefed up its 11-member
private-placement unit with the additions of two former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employees, Lawrence Aletto and
David Weiss, who will concentrate on high-yield,
below-investment-grade "junk" bond issues.
   The turnover at Prudential-Bache has been no less hectic.
The firm recently lost its private-placement head, Dorothy
Dotson, along with Shel Hirschberg, senior vice president,
and Dale Hunt, vice president, to S.G Warburg &amp; Co., the U.S.
arm of the London-based merchant bank. Ms. Dotson was
succeeded by Henry S. Miller, a former Shearson Lehman
executive who joined Prudential-Bache last summer.
   In addition to hiring Mr. Bowes from Merrill Lynch,
Prudential-Bache picked up Eli Hassine, a senior vice
president, and John Youngblood, a vice president, from
Shearson Lehman. And it hired Mary Morse, a former vice
president at Marine Midland Banks Inc., a Buffalo, N.Y.-based
unit of HongKong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. of Hong Kong.
   Shearson Lehman, in addition to seeing Messrs. Hassine and
Youngblood defect to Prudential-Bache, also recently lost its
head of private placements, Joel Glasky. It isn't clear where
Mr. Glasky has landed. Named as co-heads of Shearson Lehman's
group are Kathryn Maney and Gilbey Kamens, senior vice
presidents.
   Commercial banks haven't escaped unscathed, either. A
total of more than a dozen private-placement professionals
have jumped ship from the Citibank unit of Citicorp and the
Bankers Trust Co. unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp. to
launch their own firm, Capstar Partners, securities industry
executives said.
   Private-placement specialists help to structure deals and
target potential buyers. They typically are paid between
$200,000 to $250,000 a year, recruiters said.
   But private-placement specialists who help drum up deals
can earn far more. These specialists suggest companies that
might be ripe for privately placed deals, and work out ways
they can be structured and placed in the market. Those who
work on more complex financings can be paid anywhere between
$350,000 and $600,000, recruiters said.
   While private placement has never been considered
glamorous on Wall Street, these executives nevertheless are
increasingly valuable these days. Whitney Group's Mr.
Goldstein said, "It's one of the few areas left with
attractive spreads," or profit margins.

   Companies listed below reported quarterly profit
substantially different from the average of analysts'
estimates. The companies are followed by at least three
analysts. Results in parentheses are losses.
   The percent difference compares actual profit with the
30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues
forecasts in the past 30 days. Otherwise, actual profit is
compared with the 120-day estimate.
