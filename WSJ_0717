   WASHINGTON -- A group of investors holding 11.6% of the
stock of Justin Industries Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, said it
hired PaineWebber Inc. as a financial adviser in its effort
to acquire the brick, building materials and boot company.
   The group, led by Perry H. Sutherland and Barry S.
Rosenstein, also laid out its plans for Justin in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The group said
it would sell or close the company's unprofitable businesses,
which it lists as Featherlite Building Products, Tradewinds
Technologies and Northland Publishing. Mr. Sutherland said
the sales would leave Justin in its core businesses of boot,
brick and some industrial equipment manufacturing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, the group said it would sell excess real
estate assets and other investments and cut costs by reducing
overhead and possibly by consolidating facilities.
   The group also filed a counterclaim in federal court in
Texas, alleging that Justin officials and its board violated
proxy regulations by failing to disclose adequately the
compensation of John Justin, company chairman. The
counterclaim also alleges that the company's proxy materials
didn't disclose severance packages guaranteed its officers.
   The countersuit seeks invalidation of the election of
directors at the most recent annual meeting, invalidation of
the severance agreements, the holding of a new meeting and
dissemination of more information. Mr. Justin declined to
comment on the suit or the plan filed with the SEC.
   The countersuit was filed in answer to a suit filed by
Justin against the group in June. In that suit, Justin
alleged that the group didn't disclose in its initial filing
with the SEC in November that it intended to try to acquire
Justin. In March, Justin rejected an $18.50 a share, or
$140.5 million offer from the group.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Prices for lead and zinc
dropped sharply as bargainers for Cominco Ltd. and the United
Steelworkers of America appeared close to a settlement that
could end a strike that began July 9.
   "We're almost in a position to recommend to the
membership" a new two-year contract, said Ron Schmidt, the
union's chief negotiator. He said the union has already won
acceptable increases to wages and pensions, following a
21-hour weekend bargaining session.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There are just a couple of things to resolve," he said,
including a plan to reopen the currently dormant Sullivan
lead-zinc mine, at Kimberley, British Columbia. The proposed
two-year pact, which the union's bargaining committee hopes
to present to striking workers today, would replace one that
expired June 30, a week before the walkout began.
   The accord would cover about 700 currently inactive
workers at Sullivan, and an additional 2,900 striking workers
at Cominco's big lead-zinc smelter complex, at Trail, British
Columbia. The shutdown at Trail, which at full capacity
produces about 5.8% of the Western world's refined zinc and
about 2.6% of its refined lead, has helped drive up lead and
zinc prices in recent weeks.
   Reports of an impending settlement sent lead and zinc
prices plummeting yesterday on the London Metal Exchange.
Spot prices for lead and zinc closed at about 38 cents (U.S.)
and 70 cents (U.S.) a pound, respectively, down from 41 cents
and 75 cents at Friday's close.
   Mr. Schmidt wouldn't elaborate on the terms of the wage
and pension proposals from Cominco. But a union official said
it calls for a wage increase of about 18% over the two-year
life of the accord. The average hourly wage at Trail under
the previous pact was 16.82 Canadian dollars (US$14.54).

   DIBOLL, Texas -- Temple-Inland Inc. reported net income
rose 24% in the second quarter because of a decrease in tax
rates, despite lower operating earnings in most of its
businesses.
   Earnings rose to $65.7 million, or $1.18 a share, from
$52.9 million or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $587 million from $489 million.

   In the first six months, net rose 19% to $127.9 million,
or $2.30 a share, from $107.4 million, or $1.94 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.2 billion from $963 million.
   The company's container and containerboard group, its
largest segment, said operating earnings declined about 26%
in the quarter. Temple-Inland said that though box shipments
"remained strong," average selling prices of corrugated
cardboard declined and manufacturing costs increased.
Bleached paperboard earnings also declined.
   The company's financial services group, however, reported
operating earnings of $15.1 million compared with $1.1
million a year earlier. The company said Guaranty Federal
Savings Bank contributed $7 million to operating earnings.
The tax savings that boosted earnings for the quarter came as
a result of tax benefits associated with the purchase of
Guaranty.

   Colleges Feel Impact of Post-Cold War Cutbacks
   As Once-Reviled ROTC Slows Output of Officers

   LAWRENCE, Kan. -- From early boyhood, when he was
enthralled by World War II movies, Gregory Sherman dreamed
about becoming an Army officer.
   Joining the National Guard while still in high school, he
later slogged through four years of drills and
military-science classes here at the University of Kansas.
Even a serious knee injury didn't quench the stocky history
buff's passion to win the gold bars of a second lieutenant.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Greg Sherman's martial dreams are now dead, one of the
earliest victims of budget cuts hitting the Pentagon. Like
many other students enrolled in the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps nationwide, he's learned that today's
shrinking Army has no room for him -- at least not as a
full-time, active-duty officer. Nudged by his commanding
officer, he dropped out of the program this spring. He even
stayed away from the ROTC's graduation ceremonies a few weeks
ago to avoid the pain of watching 20 beaming classmates pin
on those beloved bars.
   "I still know, deep inside, that I'm good enough to be a
career officer," Mr. Sherman says ruefully. "If the Army was
flourishing, the way it was years ago under Reagan, I
definitely would have stuck it out. But the whole world has
changed."
   Among the first places in U.S. society to really feel the
impact of the defense-budget cuts now taking shape are
college campuses. It's an ironic turnabout from Vietnam War
days, when ROTC instructors were reviled at many schools as
the ugly face of the military-industrial complex.
   Now Uncle Sam is telling undergraduates he doesn't want
them. "Young people are graduating, but we can't bring them
on active duty because {the force} is getting smaller," Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
complained in a speech last month. "I'm getting lots of
letters from parents who are disturbed by that."
   Each of the armed services will need thousands fewer
officers in coming years, and the ROTC historically has
provided about two-thirds of those leaders. The Army faces
the deepest manpower cuts, and in just the past few months it
has quietly forced out about 900 active-duty colonels and
lieutenants.
   But the easiest way to slim is to reduce intake, so among
the most prominent targets of the cutbacks are the 86,000
students enrolled at more than 1,000 American colleges and
universities. "This is a gut-wrenching process," concedes
Maj. Gen. Wallace Arnold, who runs the Army's cadet-training
command.
   While the overall dimensions of the officer-training cuts
still aren't clear, the number of new Army ROTC graduates
assigned to active duty has dropped 25% from last year.
Shunning the less-valued, part-time reserve assignments,
about 1,000 would-be officers bailed out of Army ROTC
programs altogether in recent months. Many more are likely to
be encouraged to leave or be forced out in coming years as
standards get tougher, scholarship money dries up and ROTC
instruction is available at fewer schools.
   "We simply don't have enough money to train all the
current cadets," says Col. Robert Kuhn, the ruddy, talkative
military-science professor who has been running the Army ROTC
program here at the University of Kansas, a pleasant campus
of high-rise offices and ivy-covered classrooms nestled in
rolling farmland. Already, he says, "Students are asking when
we're going to start kicking them out."
   Ironically, all the post-Cold War changes haven't prompted
the Army's bureaucracy to issue formal orders to scale back
ROTC recruitment. So, while Col. Kuhn and his counterparts
struggle to push older cadets out of the program, the ROTC
instructors continue to be judged by how many new cadets they
sign up.
   Col. Kuhn's second-floor window offers a good view of the
spot where some of the Midwest's angriest demonstrations
against the Vietnam War took place. These days, students here
and at dozens of other campuses are protesting the Defense
Department's ban against gay men and women. The outcry began
after three openly gay cadets from Harvard, MIT and
Washington University in St. Louis were dismissed from the
ROTC or denied commissions. Since then, various school
administrators have debated taking action against the ROTC.
The Army, which last Friday announced it plans to phase out
ROTC units at 50 campuses across the country by the fall of
1991, says the schools were chosen because they turn out the
fewest officers and not because of any involvement with the
protests.
   Col. Kuhn, meanwhile, has been assigned to begin teaching
this fall at West Point, which, along with the other service
academies that traditionally turn out many of the military's
career officers, is expected to escape the brunt of the
cutbacks. But ROTC cadets don't enjoy the same powerful
protectors at the Pentagon.
   Douglas Baskett, a mechanical-engineering major and
self-described "military fanatic," resigned from the ROTC,
with some faculty encouragement, just weeks before graduation
here. Some of Mr. Baskett's friends are now officers; but all
he has to show in the way of military achievement for his
countless mornings of marching, four years of studying
military strategy and a rigorous six-week summer camp is a
piece of paper certifying that he has successfully completed
"Army Military Qualification Standards Level I." Angrily, he
says: "Nobody should go through four years of such hard work
to be weeded out at the very end."
   Paul Rocuant, a recent graduate of the University of
Connecticut, didn't wait to be pushed. Realizing that he
wouldn't get his first choice of an assignment in military
intelligence, the political-science major turned his back on
the military and enrolled in law school. "The entire Army is
surrounded by a cloud of uncertainty these days," Mr. Rocuant
explains.
   Just to increase his chances of snaring an active-duty
assignment, Dane Childs, an athletic, gung-ho type at Kansas
State University, changed his major to history from
architecture. The gambit didn't work. Mr. Childs doesn't
discourage students from joining the Army ROTC, but says,
"It's an awful lot of sweat and effort for a crapshoot."
   Even high-flying students are getting nervous. Here at the
University of Kansas, Jerry Rutherford, a pre-med student
with nearly straight A's, wakes at 5:30 a.m. almost every day
during the school year for extra training climbing ropes,
throwing grenades and speed-assembling M-16 rifles. Yet Mr.
Rutherford still worries about how cutbacks will affect his
future.
   "Above all, my father urged me to be a realist," says the
20-year-old, whose grandfather was an Army general, and whose
father now holds the same rank commanding armored forces in
northern Germany. "He stressed how hard it's going to be, how
well you will have to perform to go active duty."
   The stakes for ROTC cadets are higher these days -- and
mistakes more costly. Before graduating from Northern
Michigan University, Steven Bowman found out that the Army
rejected not only his bid to become an engineering
specialist, but also his hope of joining the active-duty
force. "I felt cheated on both ends," he recalls, and hastily
signed papers to quit the ROTC. But now the former cadet is
back in the Army reserves, still hoping to win a commission.
"For so many years, I fantasized about becoming an officer,"
Mr. Bowman explains. "A single month away from ROTC made me
realize how much I missed all the people and everything
connected with it."

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Triangle Corp. directors adopted a
so-called poison-pill measure designed to make hostile
takeover bids prohibitively expensive.
   The tool manufacturer's board said that Triangle will
distribute rights to buy preferred stock to common-share
holders of record July 26. Under certain circumstances, the
rights would entitle the holders to buy Triangle's common
shares at half price.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Triangle's board adopted the poison pill in light of the
purchase of "an ownership position" in the company by Helmut
Rothenberger, chief executive officer of the Frankfurt
hand-tool manufacturer Rothenberger Werkzeuge AG.
   "Mr. Rothenberger has not filed a Schedule 13-D with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and Triangle does not
know how much stock he (or any group of which he is a member)
intends to acquire," the company said.
   Triangle also said it doesn't know what Mr. Rothenberger's
"intentions may be generally," adding that he says he is
willing "to acquire more shares at reasonable prices."

   TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. announced
separately that they posted double-digit increases in
domestic sales in the first six months, marking records for a
half-year period.
   Toyota's domestic sales rose 14% to 1.3 million units.
Nissan's Japanese sales totaled 732,453 units, up 12%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Domestic production by the top two Japanese auto makers
was also higher, but exports were notably lower, reflecting
the trend toward overseas production.
   Exports from January to June by top market-share holder
Toyota were 851,886 units, down 6.6% from a year earlier.
Nissan's exports plummeted 17% to 461,124 units.
   In June alone, domestic sales by Toyota rose 5.2% to
224,875 units, the 15th consecutive month of gains and a new
high for the month. Nissan's domestic sales in June rose 5.3%
to 125,670 units.
   Exports in June by Toyota were up 11%, the first
year-on-year gain in three months, but Nissan's exports
slumped 9.1% in the month.

   If Two of Your Friends Write In,

   Sometimes it takes a little fertilizer to make the grass
roots grow.
   Fighting a bill by Sen. John Danforth to break up cable-TV
monopolies, American Cablevision Co. wanted the senator and
other lawmakers to know that it isn't just the cable industry
that is opposed to the proposed regulation. And the Kansas
City company figured it didn't have to look far to find
private citizens who would want to send that message to
Washington. Grassroots support could be cultivated right
there in the office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a memo circulated to its employees, the company urged
them to write letters of protest to Sen. Danforth and other
lawmakers -- as private citizens. "Use plain stationery and
your home address," the memo said. "We don't want this to
look like an organized effort." Letter writers were told they
could identify themselves as employees of the company, "but
Congress has already heard all our good arguments from the
industry's point of view."
   The memo offered a little incentive for people to raise a
ruckus. Their reward, as promised in the memo from the public
relations department: "an attractive gray Comedy Channel
T-shirt (Offer limited to the first 100 employees who
write)."
   For those who could persuade others to write, there was
more: "Copies of a letter from your aunt in Marshall or your
neighbor or anyone else are worth a mug."
   Why a T-shirt prize? "We had T-shirts coming out our
ears," says Carol Rothwell, the company's public relations
director. "We are always giving away T-shirts -- that's part
of our internal culture."
   In case correspondents couldn't think of anything to say,
the memo offered suggestions. Write "that you don't see any
need for government intervention in a private entertainment
business." Or: "I wonder why Congress is spending so much
time on cable when I have more serious concerns such as
-------." The company even provided stamps.
   Ms. Rothwell defends the campaign as a time-honored
American tradition. "Every industry does grass-roots
politics," she says. "It's been around as long as we've had a
Congress."
   American Cablevision declines to estimate the number of
letters generated by the campaign, but Steve Hilton, a press
spokesman for Sen. Danforth, says they haven't exactly been
pouring in. He puts the total at about 20. "I don't think the
postal service has been overly taxed," says Mr. Hilton.

   AT&amp;T Increases
   Rates for Services
   Used by Businesses

   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plans to
increase by the end of the month its charges for several
long-distance communications services to businesses.
   AT&amp;T's price boost, when it becomes effective July 27,
will amount to a 2% overall increase in rates for two
outbound-calling services sold to businesses and a 0.5% boost
in the monthly bill for business customers who use multiple
AT&amp;T services, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That boost, while small, would be one of the most
significant since the Federal Communications Commission last
year changed its method of regulating the company's profit
from long-distance service.
   The FCC used to make AT&amp;T set its rates according to its
costs of delivering service. Now the commission sets a "price
cap" on what AT&amp;T can charge. The idea is to motivate AT&amp;T to
cut its costs of delivering service, thereby allowing
customers to benefit from lower pricing while AT&amp;T gets to
keep more of what it makes on each call.
   Since late 1989, the company has increased certain flat
fees, such as private-line hookups and consumer calls to AT&amp;T
operators. The latest increase would apply to so-called usage
charges covering the time of day a call is made and the
distance it travels.
   AT&amp;T, which is expected to announce lower second-quarter
earnings later this week, derives more than 50% of its
revenue from long-distance service and, with a more than 65%
share, dominates the U.S. market.
   The company said the price increases will affect about 8%
of its business customers, and are being made to cover
increased costs of installing new digital equipment and
backup systems in its network, inflation and other
unspecified costs.
   "Over the past five years we've lowered {overall
long-distance} prices by 45%. Now we're talking about a 2%
bump," said a company spokeswoman. "It's fine-tuning to
maintain our service {profit} margins."
   AT&amp;T estimated that it has reduced outbound-calling prices
for businesses by 32% since 1984. It said the "price-cap"
formula by which it sets its pricing would be adjusted to
show an additional $46 million in annual revenue this year
compared with 1989, because of the latest pricing change.
   Specifically, pricing increases will apply to a customer's
network usage, including time-of-day charges and the distance
that a call travels between two points, said AT&amp;T. The
affected services are AT&amp;T Software Defined Network Service,
or SDN, and several plans within the AT&amp;T PRO WATS
long-distance service.
   For example, a six-minute call between San Francisco and
Washington using PRO WATS service will increase to $1.52 from
$1.49 today. A five-minute daytime call between Chicago and
Denver over AT&amp;T's SDN network will climb to 97 cents from
the current 95 cents.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, AT&amp;T closed
at $37.125, unchanged.

   Gloom of Night
   Can't Stay Her Hand
   At the Bridge Table

   Ruth Thorpe, Life Master,
   Has Excelled at the Game
   Since Its Very Creation

   OSWEGO, N.Y. -- Ruth Thorpe, a life master at the game,
has played bridge through three fires, twice at the Pontiac
Hotel here in Oswego and once at the Ithaca Hotel in Ithaca.
   But worse still was the raging storm that blew out the
windows at the Arlington Hotel in Binghamton, where she was
playing in a tournament with Johnny Cullinan, another life
master. The rainwater gushed in, and was soon an inch deep.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It was so cold, I was shivering and could hardly hold the
cards," says Mrs. Thorpe. "Johnny went to the bar and got me
a ginger brandy. It's the only time he ever bought me a
drink." The game, relocated hastily to a second-floor room
across the street, rolled on.
   And so has Mrs. Thorpe. Those old hotels all are gone now,
but Mrs. Thorpe is still playing bridge. Serious bridge, too.
Last February, she and her frequent partner, Audrey Johnson,
finished first in a national tournament held simultaneously
in more than 100 cities and involving 9,200 players. Mrs.
Thorpe plays in Oswego tournaments three days a week and
usually visits a sick friend for a social game Sunday nights.
   Mrs. Thorpe, bridge champion, is 95 years old.
   She began playing a card game called pedro before the
modern game of bridge was devised (by yachtsman Harold S.
Vanderbilt on a Caribbean cruise in 1926). The American
Contract Bridge League believes she is the organization's
oldest active player.
   Mrs. Thorpe is a slender, gentle woman, known as Aunt Ruth
to almost everyone in this upstate town on the shores of Lake
Ontario. She is in good health, needs no medications, pays
her own bills and bakes her own pies in the white frame
bungalow she and her late husband, Walter, built themselves
62 years ago. Her depth perception isn't what it was when she
was 90, and she is a little hard of hearing. "I must get
younger," she says, as she stumbles a bit coming down her
front steps. But at the bridge table, she is a tiger.
   "At the level we play it, bridge is a serious game," says
Mrs. Thorpe. She dismisses social bridge-rubber bridge, the
kind most amateurs play -- as "party" bridge or "kitchen"
bridge. "They talk a lot and they miss all the slams (big
winning hands)," she says during lunch at the Admiral Woolsey
waterfront restaurant here. What she plays -- what she has
been playing since doctors thought she had tuberculosis years
ago and she wasn't allowed to participate in outdoor
activities -- is duplicate bridge.
   "It's hard to imagine her life without bridge," says her
great-niece, Joan Braun. "It puts her in constant contact
with people of all ages. It gets her up and moving."
   Duplicate bridge is always played in a club or tournament
setting, with a director certified by the contract bridge
league in charge. Participants pay a nominal fee, from $2 to
$6 per person, to play. Mrs. Thorpe directed the Wednesday
afternoon tournament in Oswego for 37 years, donating her
profit -- as much as $750 in a good year -- to the Catholic
Daughters of America. Most days at her games, there were 12
or more tables. Now, she says, participation Wednesday
afternoons is down to five or six.
   In duplicate bridge, cards are placed in "boards," and
every pair ultimately plays the same hands as everyone else.
Top honors go to those who come closest to achieving the
maximum potential of the cards they play. Partners will run
up their score by making, for example, five hearts, when
everyone else is making four. "It's that extra trick that
counts," says Mrs. Thorpe.
   "The whole idea," says Jane Johnson, a league official,
"is to get the most out of each hand, whether declaring
playing the hand or defending." Winning hands, or boards,
is what counts; winning games or rubbers -- the way
conventional, social bridge is played -- has no place in the
heady world of duplicate bridge.
   Serious players win master points for their successes in
tournaments at the local, regional and national level. Mrs.
Thorpe has accumulated 1,200 master points, achieving life
master status in 1961. (She is No. 3,375 of 40,829 life
masters.) Last February, in winning the national seniors
event for players 55 and older, Mrs. Thorpe and her partner,
Audrey Johnson, 67, scored an astonishing 79.1%, which means
they played at nearly 80 percent of bridge perfection that
day. It's a little like batting .800, a state of grace no
baseball player has ever approached.
   In tournaments, contestants must fill out cards saying
which bridge-playing system they use. Mrs. Thorpe fills in
the space with one word, "standard." That means she plays a
sophisticated version of a basic system popularized by
Charles Goren more than 50 years ago. But others keep trying
to come up with more complicated systems. When Mrs. Thorpe
encounters opponents who claim to use one of these
innovations, she is delighted. "I know I'm going to fleece
them," she says.
   She is particularly contemptuous of systems that try to
fool people. "They don't scare me," she says. "They lead from
weakness, and I believe in dealing from strength. Did you
ever scare anyone by being weak?"
   The glory of duplicate bridge, and now its biggest
problem, is its difficulty. "It takes at least a year of hard
study, including lessons, to master the game," says Mrs.
Thorpe. "Young people these days are very smart, but they
have so many other things they want to do."
   Also, the good players are sometimes rude and aggressive
and scare off the novices. Mrs. Thorpe -- a member of the
league's national goodwill committee, which seeks to promote
decorum and table manners -- remembers with distaste a
tournament in which a frustrated player picked up his chair
and flung it against a nearby wall.
   Because many of the serious players are growing old, the
game tends to thrive in retirement communities, especially in
Florida and California. The contract bridge league says it
has 4,000 clubs and 190,000 members. No one has any idea how
many Americans still play "party" bridge socially.
   Oswego has always been a good bridge-playing town, and
Mrs. Thorpe and her friend Mr. Cullinan are living legends in
the whole central New York area. They still bask in the
reflected glory of Oswego's greatest bridge player, a doctor
named William Halsey, who used to teach nurses to play the
game during idle moments in the operating room.
   "He died at the bridge table in 1949," says Mr. Cullinan.
"And when the tragic news reached Peg Weekes, our best woman
player, her first question was, `What was he in?' `One
spade,' she was told. Peg thought for a second or two and
said, `He probably should have been in four.' And, sure
enough, when they went back and looked at the board, it
became obvious he had seriously underbid his hand."
   "It's probably what did him in," notes Mrs. Thorpe.

   JAPAN REPAYS A LOAN

   Japan repaid its last World Bank loan yesterday.
   Outstanding was the last installment on a 25-year, $75
million loan to the Japan Highway Public Corp. to finance a
segment of highway that runs between Tokyo and Nagoya in
central Japan, a World Bank spokeswoman said. The loan was
taken out at 6% annual interest in 1965.
   Between 1953 and 1966, Japan borrowed $862.9 million from
the World Bank to finance 31 projects, becoming the second
largest debtor to the bank after India. "The World Bank
provided money during Japan's roughest times," said Seiichiro
Yonekura, professor of business history at Hitotsubashi
University. "Without its help, Japan's postwar recovery would
have been inconceivable."
   Japan is now the second-largest contributor after the U.S.
to the international loan institution, bearing 6.69% of its
total shares. The bank also borrows up to one-third of its
funds in the Tokyo money market.
                                                                                                       

   SHUTDOWN IN ARGENTINA
                                                                                                       

   Twenty branch offices of Argentina's national mortgage
bank were closed yesterday, private news agencies reported.
The remaining eight branches eventually will be closed and
all 2,200 employees laid off, bank director Raul Chacon
reportedly said. The closings came without warning to the
bank's staff or clients. The government of President Carlos
Menem maintains the mortgage bank loses huge sums, is
overstaffed and poorly run. According to news reports, the
entity owes $1 billion to Argentina's central bank.
                                                                                                       

   SAS PILOTS' STRIKE
                                                                                                       

   Scandinavian Airlines System canceled two thirds of its
domestic flights in Sweden and one third of Scandinavian and
European flights yesterday because of a one-day strike by
Swedish pilots. The airline, whose Danish and Norwegian
pilots were working normally, said it would transfer
passengers to other airlines or arrange for them to travel by
bus. SAS said it was prepared to pay a 7% wage increase
recommended by mediators last week but only if the pilots
accepted a more flexible work schedule. The pilots say they
have already made concessions on working hours and have

   ITALY VS. TAX EVADERS
                                                                                                       

   Frustrated by legions of Italian tax evaders, revenue
agents have begun boarding luxury boats to see if the owners'
income declarations are as high as their life styles.
Treasury officers checked out 217 yachts anchored in the Bay
of Naples over the weekend, RAI state television reported.
The report didn't say how many tax evaders were discovered by
the visits. But among the yacht owners was a man who had
described himself in tax forms as a street vendor with little
earnings, RAI said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW TOSHIBA NETWORK
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Toshiba Corp. announced that it has begun to build
an integrated communications network to link its overseas
subsidiaries and liaison offices in 220 locations in 36
countries. The network, scheduled to begin full operations in
December 1991, will include intracompany telephone, facsimile
transmission, electronic-mail and data-communications
systems. Toshiba plans to spend some five billion yen ($33.8
million) on the project and said it expects to cut
communications expenses by 35% a year.
                                                                                                       

   SPECIAL LUFTHANSA FLIGHTS
                                                                                                       

   Lufthansa, West Germany's national air carrier, will
operate two special flights to East Berlin in August, the
first time in 45 years the airline will fly to the city in
which it was founded. A spokesman said the airline received
clearance from the Allied powers to fly children from
Chernobyl, in the Soviet Union, to East Berlin for a
vacation. Lufthansa is seeking permission to operate regular
flights to Berlin by the end of the year.
                                                                                                       

   SWITCH FROM SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD
                                                                                                       

   Britain's largest jewelry retailer said it would stop
selling jewelry made with South African gold. The decision
followed pickets of its stores by anti-apartheid groups.
   A spokesman for the company, Ratners PLC, said the move
was part of a continuing switch to North American gold
supplies. He denied the move was in reponse to anti-apartheid
pressure.
   Ratners said South African gold is found in 2% to 3% of
its gold jewelry.
   One anti-apartheid group, End Loans to South Africa, said
it and other groups had applied pressure on Ratners in
response to African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela's
call to intensify sanctions and boycott South African goods
to end apartheid. The End Loans group said it has suspended
its action against Ratners and is asking other groups to do
the same.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Thieves used a three-ton truck yesterday to smash the
window of Asprey's, one of London's most renowned jewelers,
and escaped with a diamond necklace reportedly valued at
almost $900,000. The thieves reversed the truck toward the
New Bond Street shop, smashing its window with a girder
protruding from the back of the vehicle. . . . China needs 10
million tons of additional water each day to meet the needs
of 300 major cities that are facing water shortages, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.

   NCR Surprises, Posts Results That Top
   2nd-Period Sales, Revenue Expectations

   NCR Corp. surprised investors with solid profit and
revenue gains for the second quarter, pushing the big
computer maker's shares higher in active trading.
   Dayton, Ohio-based NCR reported net income of $115
million, or $1.66 a share, up 4.5% from $110 million, or
$1.42 a share, in the 1989 second quarter, when the company
had a larger base of shares outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue climbed 5% to $1.61 billion from $1.53 billion.
   NCR said strong foreign sales offset continuing weakness
in the U.S. market. Despite the slow domestic sales, the
company said it still expects to achieve profit and revenue
gains for the year.
   "The quarter looked good almost across the board: Sales
were up, gross margins were up, and discretionary spending
was down," Don Young, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co., said. The one negative factor was continuing weakness in
domestic orders, he said.
   Mr. Young also said he expects NCR to report strong
earnings for the current quarter, but he called the fourth
quarter "a question mark," as the company is to begin a risky
product-line transition in the fall.
   Investors welcomed the company's earnings report, bidding
NCR shares up $3.875 each to close at $68 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, with 407,100 shares changing
hands. Average daily turnover in the stock is about 250,000
shares.
   Favorable currency-exchange rates in the second quarter
also boosted NCR's results, analysts said, an effect that
should extend into the third quarter. And analysts lauded the
company's tight rein on expenses. "NCR has some of the best
cost controls in the industry, and that was a significant
factor in the second quarter," Jay P. Stevens of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. said. "They manage factory inventories closely,
and they don't have excess people."
   NCR's chairman and chief executive officer, Charles E.
Exley, said orders abroad set a record in the second quarter,
showing a "substantial gain" from year-earlier activity. The
improvements offset a decline in U.S. orders, he said.
   Bank automation systems and check-processing equipment
were particularly strong, while the NCR Tower series of
computers posted a third consecutive record quarter in sales,
the company said.
   Mr. Exley said second-half results will be helped if
foreign-exchange rates continue at current levels. "Despite
the softness of U.S. incoming orders in the second quarter,
we still see the opportunity to achieve single-digit growth
in revenue and net income for the full year," he said.
   During the second quarter, NCR purchased 2.2 million of
its shares under a previously announced buy-back program. NCR
said the buy-backs continued to boost per-share earnings
while hurting net income. The company had an average of 69.3
million shares outstanding in the latest quarter, down from
an average of 77.7 million a year earlier. Higher research
spending also cut into earnings, the company said.
   First-half net dropped 2.3% to $167 million, or $2.38 a
share, from $171 million, or $2.17 a share. The increase in
earnings per share reflected the stock buy-backs. Revenue
grew 3.3% to $2.87 billion from $2.78 billion.

   WASHINGTON -- Business inventories rose slightly in May,
the Commerce Department reported, but they were outpaced by
an increase in sales.
   Inventories of retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers
rose to $799.40 billion in May, up 0.4% from $796.05 billion
in April. Sales reached $538.33 billion, up 0.9% from the
April figure of $533.60 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Inventories equaled 1.48 months' sales in May, meaning it
would take companies just under 1 1/2 months to sell off
their inventories at the month's buying pace. The ratio was
down slightly from April's 1.49 but was higher than March's
1.47.
   Total sales rose on the strength of the manufacturing and
wholesale sectors, with retail sales down 0.6%. Analysts saw
little encouragement in the sales figures. "I don't think the
sales rise signals a rebound in this economy," said Gary
Ciminero, chief economist for Fleet/Norstar Financial Group
Inc.
   Automobile inventories were down slightly in May,
prompting some apprehension about the rise in non-automotive
inventories. "There is some concern about inventories going
up outside of automobiles," said Daniel Friel, economist for
NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. "Those inventories have gone up
enough to be of some concern."
   All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal variations.

   Take a travelogue, combine it with a series of
reminiscences, throw in some sociological observations and a
couple of true confessions, and you will have a pretty clear
idea how Peter Conrad produced his most recent book, "Where I
Fell to Earth: A Life in Four Cities" (Poseidon, 252 pages,
$18.95). Mr. Conrad is an Oxford professor whose previous
books include a memoir about his childhood in Tasmania and a
book about opera. He divides his time between an apartment in
Manhattan's Greenwich Village, a renovated cottage in London,
his rooms at Oxford, and a house in Lisbon.
   Of the four cities he calls home, Mr. Conrad concentrates
most on New York, where he is able to indulge his
self-confessed voyeuristic impulses to the fullest. From the
window in his West Village apartment an array of peek-a-boo
images presents itself: a young woman writer, a boy who spray
paints his wall to look like spaghetti, and an
exhibitionistic male dancer in a cowboy costume who performs
a nightly striptease for anyone interested enough to watch.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A fascinated but guilty onlooker, Mr. Conrad compares
himself with Jimmy Stewart in Alfred Hitchcock's movie "Rear
Window." In the downtown nightclubs, at the annual Village
Halloween parade and on the everyday streets he spies on the
bizarre display of human nature surrounding him. New York, to
him, is merely a spectator sport.
   At Christ Church College, Oxford, where Mr. Conrad teaches
English literature for part of the year, he is not quite so
disinterested an observer. He describes the careful college
rituals in which he is obligated to participate: At dinners,
"there is a strict league of seniority, which sometimes now I
am aghast to find myself at the top of . . . I have to mutter
a Latin grace which I can never get right." Sometimes the
rituals are obscure to the point of absurdity: Academics at
Christ Church have arbitrarily decided that the proper
college time is five minutes ahead of Greenwich mean time,
"so when we ring the bell and say grace, we take care to be
out of step with everyone else. What better evidence could
there be of England's anachronistic quaintness?"
   If Oxford requires mature behavior according to a strict
code of rules, Lisbon is where Mr. Conrad goes to recapture a
childhood mood, "squeezed into vacations from adult
existence." At the home of friends there, he hangs around the
kitchen help, explores the neighborhood, is easily moved to
tears by a procession of the Virgin. He also likes his London
residence, a renovated cottage hidden from the street,
because it too resembles a child's playhouse: "Here is my
child's cabin, my fugitive's unlicensed hideout, my
observer's oblique periscope."
   Mr. Conrad lives in four very different places, yet none
of them is quite a home. For him, after an adolescence spent
yearning to leave his parents' orderly, boring Tasmanian
house, "flight was always my ambition, my motive and my
motor." Though Mr. Conrad seems to want us to believe that a
life of running from one city to another is exciting, it only
seems sad. He is eager to play the role of the wistful
onlooker or the child who never grew up, but he never seems
able to be a full participant in any of the worlds he
inhabits. Perhaps without meaning to, Mr. Conrad tells us
more about his own inescapable melancholy than about the
charm and the novelty of travel.
   Offering a far sunnier atmosphere is Peter Mayle's "A Year
in Provence" (Knopf, 207 pages, $19.95). Mr. Mayle and his
wife, Jenny, who are British, decided after many vacations in
Provence to buy a house near the Luberon mountains not far
from Avignon and to move in for good. This is a
month-by-month record of their first year, which they spent
renovating their 18th-century stone farmhouse with the help
of many local laborers.
   The Mayles' year in Provence is full of small challenges:
trying to understand the "rich, soupy" local patois; heating
their large house; and moving a new stone table, weighing
about 800 pounds, from the driveway to their enclosed
courtyard. Then there is the problem of how to discourage the
scores of old friends who are eager to visit as soon as the
weather gets warm. Yet the Mayles, who seem to be an almost
impossibly genial couple, rise to every occasion with their
sense of humor intact.
   They have lots of help, ranging from their
clarinet-playing plumber to the pool man, a dandy in
sunglasses and gray flannels. Apparently the Mayles had an
endless supply of money to pour into their investment, for a
good part of the year was spent employing the services of a
steady parade of contractors, masons, electricians and sundry
local experts including a certified chimney sweep. And there
always were neighbors on hand to supply extra advice; one of
them, Massot, is a crusty old eccentric who claims to eat
foxes (recipe included).
   Though Mr. Mayle is not about to acquire a taste for fox,
he describes the more traditional Provencal food with
delight. This is, of course, a part of the world where
builders stop work promptly at noon to unpack a six-course
lunch and where everyone knows where to find the best
truffles or olive oil. The Mayles take their food and wine as
seriously as the locals, tucking into earthy winter feasts
and snapping up the first baby vegetables of spring in the
outdoor markets.
   "A Year in Provence," like the many good meals its author
describes, offers fleeting but genuine satisfaction.

   Bookshorts: Help for the Suburban Yard Slave

   The suburban yard slave is ruled by four interlocking
principalities: sprinkler system, lawn, wife, lawn mower. The
oppressive cycle is quite well known: Sprinkler waters lawn,
lawn grows and distresses wife, wife sends slave out to run
lawn mower over lawn, peace returns to household.
   This process is repeated once a week, usually on
Saturdays, though some slaves also mow Wednesday evenings,
keeping the yard trim while the wife sits inside, packing
herself with carbohydrates. It was to protect this way of
life that Patton whipped the Wehrmacht and Truman nuked
Japan.
</LP>

   Some are happily enslaved, but for those who desire their
freedom, two new books may be of help. Paul Dempsey's "How to
Repair Tecumseh Engines" (TAB Books, Blue Ridge Summit, Pa.;
295 pages; $24.95 hardcover, $14.95 paperback) can help you
neutralize your lawn mower, while Richard L. Austin's "Lawn
Sprinklers: A Do-It-Yourself Guide" (TAB; 147 pages; $19.95
hardcover, $12.95 paperback) is an excellent book on how to
launch an attack on your watering system. Both include
indexes and detailed illustrations.
   The authors, to be sure, have not set out to free the lawn
lackey. To the contrary, their purpose is to keep his
manacles in good working order. No matter. If you know how to
fix a lawn mower, you also know how to sabotage it. Let us
begin with the Tecumseh engine.
   Mr. Dempsey, it must be said, is a fan of the Tecumseh,
reveling in the minutiae of these popular one-cycle,
air-cooled engines whose displacement runs from two to nearly
30 inches. He does admit to some slighting of outboard
powerheads due to space limitations, but this cannot be held
against him.
   Yet at one point, however, he goes a little far, opining
that "These engines are also used on many Toro lawn mowers,
which are generally considered to be the finest mowers built
in the United States." As the owner of a Lawn Boy, I take
some offense at this assertion; perhaps the author should
consider dropping this insensitive boasting from subsequent
printings.
   But all hostility fades as the book unlocks the secrets of
these doomsday machines, from their ignition systems to their
carburetors to the especially complex "DC system with diode
in harness." By merely reversing the repair directions, the
slave can render the most ferocious of these machines
impotent. One carefully planned slip of the screwdriver and
life is regained.
   Depending on the IQ of the wife, a slave sometimes can get
away with only a slight adjustment. Mr. Dempsey's
troubleshooting chart, for instance, points out that engines
will not start if the gas tank is empty. This is an old
trick, but certainly worth a try. A closed fuel shutoff
valve, the author points out, also can cause trouble. Try
closing it and see if she catches on. Then there's the
mechanical version of cardiac arrest -- poor compression --
which requires that the owner "overhaul engine." In this
case, you might as well call the lawn service and dust off
those golf clubs. That dang lawn mower is as good as dead.
   An attack on the sprinkler system, on the other hand, will
make tinkering with the lawn mower unnecessary, at least if
you live in a place where rain is scarce. Here in Denver, for
instance, a few weeks without water and your yard looks like
a big piece of burnt toast.
   There are plenty of ways to sabotage a sprinkler system,
all of which can be done on the sly. Control and circuit
valves are easy targets, but watch out for that back flow
unit. Mess that up and you've got debris and lawn chemicals
in your water system, and that stuff tastes just awful.
   Again, depending on the IQ of the wife, the slave has
several options in his quest to monkey wrench the lawn, all
of them detailed in Mr. Austin's masterwork. Perhaps the
easiest is to do a little surgery on the brains of the system
-- the timer box, an electrically powered device that
controls when the sprinklers turn on and off. One strategy:
Don't set the timers at all. If that's too obvious, set the
sprinkling time for about five minutes, which is not enough
to keep the patient alive. On the other hand, if the wife is
really dumb, just unplug the sucker]
   Forgetting to pay the water bill also will do the trick.
   So what do you do for fun once your lawn dries up? Plenty.
Here in the semi-arid regions, those of us with dogs can
spend some of that time ridding the property of the canine
version of buffalo chips, which dry golf-ball hard in the
burning Western sun.
   The procedure is simple: Enter the yard before the
neighbors awake, take 9-iron, chip offending matter into
neighbors' yard. If caught, explain that your dead yard no
longer needs the fertilizer. Chances are, your neighbors will
appreciate your consideration.

   Retailing:
   Home Depot's Do-It-Yourself Powerhouse

   ATLANTA -- When Home Depot Inc. opened its first
home-improvement stores in the Northeast last year, it took
the uncommon and expensive step of relocating dozens of
people to head departments such as plumbing and paint.
   Why bother to move hourly employees hundreds of miles to
sell cans of paint? The company wanted the new stores to be
headed by employees bred in the Home Depot culture, people
who "bleed orange," a term of honor derived from store
workers' orange aprons.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With a culture that stresses candor among employees and a
commitment to service that transcends lip service, Home Depot
has remodeled the more than $100 billion home-improvement
industry and become one of the nation's fastest-growing
retailers. In sales per square foot, an important measure of
retail performance, Home Depot's $303 figure last year beat
out the likes of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., K mart Corp. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
   Enamored with such numbers, Wall Street has pushed up Home
Depot's stock price about 77% this year -- a jump that comes
despite a cloudier industry outlook and regrouping efforts by
competitors.
   Home Depot has become the largest home-repair chain in the
business by winning over customers first with broad selection
and low prices. In each of its 126 stores in the South and on
the East and West coasts, Home Depot sells more than 30,000
fix-it items, triple the number for typical hardware stores.
In its spartan warehouses with ceiling rafters and concrete
floors, the company has been able to slash costs,
undercutting hardware stores by 20% and matching or beating
its warehouse competitors.
   More important, though, is the company's slavish attention
to service, sometimes won by playing hardball with
manufacturers. Using its volume-buying clout, Home Depot
demands that the makers of products, such as certain light
fixtures and gas grills, rewrite instructions it deems
incomprehensible. It has strong-armed vendors into putting
bar codes on such unwieldy items as plywood and wood dowels
to speed up checkout lines. And it hires former electricians
and tradespeople to ensure that shoppers get skilled advice.
   "Trying to wed two conflicting strategies -- low-cost
structure with broad assortment and a high level of customer
service -- is arguably one of the most difficult retail
concepts to pull off," says David Bolotsky, an analyst with
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. "Home Depot is further along the
learning curve than anyone else."
   That curve, though, has had its share of rough spots. Five
years ago, rapid expansion hurt the company. Stretched too
thin, management was forced to curtail new-store openings and
to sell off some properties after earnings took a dive. "That
was a tremendous strain," concedes Bernard Marcus, Home
Depot's 61-year-old chairman and chief executive officer.
   Earnings have rebounded since then. In its year ended Jan.
28, Home Depot's net income jumped 46% to $112 million, or
$1.42 a share, and sales climbed 38% to $2.76 billion, the
most in the industry. With those numbers behind it, the
company believes its current plan to triple in size to about
365 stores by 1995 is manageable.
   Maybe. Sales in the home-improvement market are slowing.
Partly as a result of a softer housing market, home-repair
industry sales are expected to climb only 1% to 6% annually
in the next five years, compared with the 7% to 15% surges in
much of the 1980s, according to Management Horizons, a Price
Waterhouse consulting unit that tracks the retail industry.
   In the meantime, Home Depot has forced some retailers to
copy its warehouse format. K mart, for one, developed
Builders Square, a warehouse chain that has grown to 145
stores since the mid-1980s. But analysts believe Builders
Square, despite having more stores, is weaker in service,
selection and presentation of products.
   Competitors also have begun playing on Home Depot's
weaknesses. Some building-material chains, such as Lowe's
Cos., North Wilkesboro, N.C., are pursuing sales to small
contractors, an important clientele that Home Depot recently
has been trying to target more. Some smaller hardware chains
have adopted a convenience-store orientation, eschewing
discounts and selection while opening more stores to become
more accessible to shoppers.
   Still other stores, including Builders Square, are trying
to steal sales from Home Depot by offering professional
installation services for items such as gutters and roof
shingles. This type of service, which Home Depot says it has
begun to experiment with, is particularly well suited for a
growing number of consumers termed buy-it-yourselfers. They
purchase products such as kitchen cabinets for bargain prices
at home centers, then hire someone to do the installation.
   The stores that have had the most trouble responding to
Home Depot are independent stores lacking strong roots in
their communities. "Right now, when Home Depot goes into an
area, they just cut up and spit out the independents," says
Walter Stoeppelwerth, a remodeling consultant in Bethesda,
Md.
   Much of Home Depot's success comes from the culture it's
developed. Mr. Marcus and President Arthur Blank, the pair
who founded the company in 1978, encourage a fierce
competiveness. At sales meetings, managers cheer cartoons of
Homer, Home Depot's handyman mascot, visiting competitors in
hospital beds and unplugging their life-support systems.
   The founders also take pains to encourage a high level of
candor in the company. Once each quarter, the executives
answer impromptu questions from any of Home Depot's army of
20,000 employees in orange aprons on a live talk-and-rally
session beamed by satellite to the stores.
   At a February meeting, store managers got to poke fun at
the company's merchandise buyers in a contest to pick the
worst product of the year. Entries included an electric
heater that wouldn't shut off, a ceiling fan that shook and
hummed, and a flimsy paint tray that sagged when paint was
poured into it.
   The buyers weren't overly ashamed, though, because Home
Depot puts a premium on experimentation. No adherent to the
"if it ain't broke, don't fix it" philosophy, the company is
constantly tinkering with its merchandise mix. Going beyond
the faucets and cabinets that it already offers for kitchen
remodeling, for example, the company has begun to test sales
of refigerators and stoves.
   Home Depot also takes steps to prevent dilution of its
culture. Store managers, who typically earn a $45,000 base
salary, are never hired from outside. The highest entry-level
position in the stores is assistant manager. Once the
assistant learns the culture and proves he's adept at
training others, he may advance to store manager. Mr. Marcus
and Mr. Blank, who spend about 40% of their time visiting
stores, are personally involved in training every manager --
a practice likely to be strained by the company's rapid
growth.
   Training for store workers stresses taking care of
customers first, then stocking shelves. That way, the
stocking becomes the interruption, instead of the other way
around. Sometimes, however, workers become so busy with
shoppers that pallets of merchandise sit untended, blocking
aisles -- a problem that Mr. Marcus acknowledges. Among other
things, the company is studying the use of special night
crews to stock shelves.
   Having highly trained, ready-to-serve salespeople helps
Home Depot in its mission to give novice do-it-yourselfers
the confidence to try increasingly complex and expensive
projects. "Most of us aren't plumbers," says Leonard Berry,
director of Texas A&amp;M University's Retailing Studies Center.
"Home Depot helps you through the mystery of home upkeep."
   It did for Robert and Phyllis Witherington, bankers by
day, home tinkerers by night. They were recently in a Home
Depot in Kennesaw, Ga., outside Atlanta, buying some paint
for their garage. Mr. Witherington mentioned to the paint
salesman that his front porch steps were in disrepair. The
salesman directed Mr. Witherington to a display with several
types of concrete and pamphlets on concrete repair. Knowing
they can find solid advice and the proper materials for
projects, the Witheringtons are now planning a complex and
costly job -- expanding their deck.

   NEW YORK -- Fresh-faced, mild-mannered, hardworking and
armed with an M.B.A., Clifford Gookin could have earned
himself a nice, steady living just about anywhere in
corporate America. But who wanted a steady living when Wall
Street beckoned?
   By the time he was 32 years old, this son of a Pine Bluff,
Ark., chicken-feed salesman was earning close to $500,000 a
year, flying around the world to give advice to corporations,
and living in a $750,000 Connecticut home with stereophonic
sound piped into several of its eight rooms.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gookin was no Bruce Wasserstein or Henry Kravis. He
was a mid-Eighties Everyman on Wall Street, a soldier who
executed deals, not a honcho who brought in big clients. Like
hundreds of his peers, he had a good resume: He had gone to
Harvard Business School and joined the First Boston Corp.
class of 1983. Then he got swept up in one of the great
financial booms in history.
   This was a working experience truly unlike others. Even
junior employees routinely jumped from firm to firm in search
of ever higher six-figure compensation; departments grew so
fast that members had to introduce themselves at Monday
morning meetings. In short, Mr. Gookin was very much in the
right place at the right time.
   Until last December. Just before Christmas, Mr. Gookin's
boss, John Harrison, told him their division, leveraged
buy-outs, was going through a "slowdown," and that he should
return to his old department, investment banking. But when he
reported to investment banking, Mr. Gookin learned that
department had just begun layoffs and couldn't accommodate
him. So Mr. Gookin returned to Mr. Harrison, who simply said,
"Gee, I'm really sorry."
   That was it, though it took a few minutes for Mr. Gookin
to realize he had just been fired.
   Mr. Gookin is hardly alone. Despite the strong stock
market, the securities business has slashed some 45,000 jobs
nationwide since 1987; the carnage that began with low-paid
clerks has spread upward to once highflying, high-paid
investment bankers. Most who are lucky enough to have kept
their jobs are anticipating salaries much more in line with
those in other industries.
   Many others have lost their jobs and say they simply don't
understand. Elaine S. Gilde, a graduate of Harvard Business
School, was a director in the merchant banking group at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co, where she worked on some successful
deals, such as a junk-bond financing for retailer Ann Taylor.
In January, she was terminated, and she is still looking for
work. "What's wrong with this picture?" she wonders. "I did
all the right things. I went to all the right schools."
Recently, she ran into a Harvard classmate -- at the
unemployment office. "It's a true commentary on 1990," she
says.
   Mr. Gookin similarly wonders what went wrong with his
world. Even though he himself once left First Boston in favor
of a competitor's higher offer during good times, he doesn't
understand why First Boston didn't stand behind him in bad.
After all, many of the firm's senior managers continue to
make seven-figure salaries that, if cut, could sustain a lot
of Mr. Gookins.
   Now he is divorced. The home with the stereophonic sound
is gone along with most of his savings. He is job-hunting. He
paid his own way to fly from New York to Los Angeles for a
job interview, only to have the interview canceled after he
got there. Two finance jobs he thought were in his grasp went
to rival job seekers from the defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   Like the loser in a real-life game of musical chairs, Mr.
Gookin feels a sense of injustice, and of disbelief. "I was
making more money {in a year} than my father had earned in
his entire life," he says. "I figured that if they were
paying me that much, somebody must have thought highly of
me."
   None of the present or former First Boston officials
mentioned in this article would comment. A spokesman for the
firm, which paid Mr. Gookin 12 weeks severance and a bonus
for 1989, doesn't dispute Mr. Gookin's account, adding that
he was "a good man" victimized by a shrinking workload.
   Former clients like Tom Moore, chief executive of
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., praise Mr. Gookin's work. At Blodgett
Corp., a Vermont pizza-oven maker sold in an LBO that First
Boston sponsored, Chief Financial Officer Sam Hartwell says,
"I'd go anywhere with him. He represented our interests. He's
not a `Bonfire of the Vanities' type guy."
   Mr. Gookin says he rarely attended the Manhattan dinner
parties to which his peers flocked when the workday was done.
He describes himself as a homebody who thrived on work. "I
couldn't name-drop about who I saw in the Hamptons," he says,
referring to the wealthy Long Island resort towns. "I've
never been to the Hamptons."
   He came to Wall Street after graduating from Claremont
Men's College in California, working for two years for
management consultants McKinsey &amp; Co., and attending Harvard
Business School.
   The Street's boom was just beginning, and while other
industries also sent recruiters to Cambridge, Mass., the town
seemed to be crawling with investment bankers ready to throw
their money around in search of Harvard recruits. Mr. Gookin
signed up following a dinner at pricey Locke-Ober's on the
Boston Common, at which he remembers First Boston's Robert
Cotter, who is now the firm's mergers boss, telling him that
First Boston was hot, and a really fun place to boot.
   It took a while for the fun to start. Once in, Mr. Gookin
began grinding out the computer calculations and stilted
prose of the paper work behind the securities deals his
superiors had thought up. The hours were long, but it wasn't
all drudgery. There were drinks with clients at the Harvard
Club, or, after closing a deal, dinner at the steakhouse
Christ Cella, where the tab for one can run to $75.
   During one 1985 deal for Sperry Corp. bonds in which a
drafting session at the printer's office broke up before
dawn, the printer installed the 27-year-old Mr. Gookin at the
Stanhope Hotel, sumptuously decked out with Limoges china and
Baccarat crystal.
   As Mr. Gookin moved up the pecking order he reveled in the
role of the "workhorse," the junior person in charge, on some
deals, of the nuts and bolts work: coordinating with clients,
writing and crunching numbers, making sure that deadlines
were met. Mr. Gookin would assemble a team of associates and
convert an office into a war room. "You're kind of like the
field marshal," Mr. Gookin says.
   Mr. Gookin says First Boston was still small enough back
in 1985 that the place seemed like a "family" to him. But all
kinds of deals -- stock and bond offerings, mergers,
takeovers -- were pouring into the firm and its major
competitors. The simple need for even relatively
inexperienced bodies like Mr. Gookin to do the routine work
was enormous. And the headhunters were out in force.
   Mr. Gookin learned that Bear Stearns &amp; Co. was offering a
vice presidency for young associates willing to work in its
San Francisco office. He quickly applied, and, offered a 25%
pay increase, soon left his First Boston family. His bosses
there, he recalls, weren't even angry. Loyalty wasn't
particularly expected, and First Boston itself was routinely
stealing employees from competitors.
   Thus, the powerful Joseph Perella, who along with Mr.
Wasserstein ran First Boston's merger group, jumped at the
chance to steal Mr. Gookin back from Bear Stearns a year
later. Mr. Gookin hadn't enjoyed his move to the West Coast,
and he called Mr. Perella to tell him that. While in San
Francisco on business, Mr. Perella had the 28-year-old to
breakfast at his hotel, the Stanford Court. He offered him
his pick of jobs. "You can go any place you want," Mr. Gookin
recalls the senior banker saying.
   Mr. Gookin says he returned a chastened man. This time, he
insists, "I was totally dedicated" to staying at First
Boston. His return was also greeted as a minor event: After
all, he was the second prodigal son to return to the firm
from Bear Stearns within a few months.
   In 1987 First Boston awarded him a vice presidency and the
chance to speak to the annual gathering of its new recruits,
a speech he would make for three years straight -- including
one four months before his own dismissal.
   "I was the epitome of what it was like to be a young,
successful, First Boston investment banker," he says.
   The trim, boyish-looking Mr. Gookin was introduced as a
trooper who had strayed and seen the error of his ways. He
recalls looking out over the group of about 150: They were
"tall, mostly white, mostly men. Most of them were athletes.
They had short hair. A lot of them showed up in suspenders.
In terms of uniformity, they looked like the Marines."
   Mr. Gookin says his speech was designed to deflate the
super-confident group. "I called it the mogul speech -- how
to become a mogul," he recalls, saying that he basically told
them that despite their suspenders, they weren't yet moguls
and would have to work very hard to get there.
   Mr. Gookin observes that not all of the younger associates
got the message. One associate none too fond of late hours
used to leave his jacket on the back of his chair, his light
on, his calculator out and his papers in a deliberate
clutter, so that any manager taking an evening stroll would
think he was still at work. Another had his computer rigged
so that when a superior walked by he could switch from video
games to spreadsheets at the touch of a key.
   Mr. Gookin recalls a particular Monday morning in which
managing director Richard Bott, who prized his meticulously
polished Chippendale desk, found that someone, presumably his
overworked subordinates, had left a pepperoni pizza face-down
on the desktop right where Mr. Bott could normally see his
own reflection.
   When they weren't working, Mr. Gookin recalls, talk among
many of the young associates often strayed to the feasibility
of jetting to Paris for the weekend or helicoptering among
various Canadian ski resorts.
   Mr. Gookin's responsibilities were growing. "It was
unbelievable: I'd have two or three deals going
simultaneously." Pressed into service at the financial
printers in the small hours of the morning, Mr. Gookin would
see competitors from two, three, four rival firms, proof that
even while the city slept, Wall Street's deal-making
machinery was grinding on.
   During one deal, on which Mr. Gookin had been working
nearly nonstop for weeks, he began living on and off at the
Omni Berkshire Place hotel near the office. On another
project, deciding whether to issue stock for an Australian
fire-extinguisher maker, Wormald Ansul Ltd., he went on a
six-week tour of the company's operations in England, Brazil,
Canada and Australia.
   The hours, however, were beginning to take their toll on
his marriage. After a 36-hour flight from Australia, Mr.
Gookin missed part of his wife's birthday celebration. "At
some point, how many kids' birthday parties or holidays or
special events can you miss and not have it create some
tension?" he says. "There were soccer practices, piano,
debates. I tried to hit the important things."
   And then there were problems at the office as well. In
early 1988 the firm's two superstars, Messrs. Wasserstein and
Perella, left to set up their own firm, taking 23 people with
them. Then, the firm's leveraged buy-out division left,
virtually en masse, to start its own shop, Vestar Capital
Partners.
   Mr. Gookin, who worked in the investment-banking
department, was transferred to help fill the gaping hole in
the LBO group, which managed 14 investments where First
Boston had taken its own money and bought an ownership stake
in a company, and which looked for other such investments.
   After a few years of advising clients, the 31-year-old now
found himself with the job of deciding in a matter of days
whether First Boston should spend hundreds of millions of
dollars to bid for a company, and at what price. Companies
were being picked off left and right, and the competition was
intense because the fees that the investment bank could make
on such a deal were enormous. Mr. Gookin describes it as
"like driving a car at 100 miles per hour with a blindfold
on."
   At one point, Mr. Gookin, no expert in the mining trade,
found himself with a hard hat on in a Louisiana salt mine in
order to judge the value of Domtar Inc.'s Sifto Salt
division, which was up for sale. Trying to learn more, he
swallowed hard and sat down to a lunch of broiled alligator
with the mine's manager, served by the manager's wife.
   Mr. Gookin, who wasn't convinced by what he saw of Sifto's
operations, persuaded First Boston to bid low. Many of the
unit's assets were eventually bought by North American Salt
Co.
   In fact, none of Mr. Gookin's four bids during his tenure
in the LBO group was a winner, a move he attributes to
prudence in an overheated and speculative market, but which
he also says added up to zero fees for First Boston. His
stock was plummeting. Only he didn't know how far.
   To make matters worse, his mentor in the LBO group was
pushed aside. Mr. Gookin says senior managers were being
hired from outside the firm. "The people who became your boss
didn't know you or what you were capable of," he says. When
he pitched an idea, he began to get the impression that his
bosses weren't even listening.
   Then, in the middle of last year, Mr. Gookin's marriage
ended. He lost the house and most of his savings in the
divorce settlement after his wife's lawyer made much of the
fact that Mr. Gookin was a successful investment banker. He
thought the settlement generous but says his lawyer told him
to accept because "you can earn your way out." Six months
later, Mr. Gookin was out of work.
   He spent the next several months on the empty 35th floor
of one of First Boston's two midtown office towers, a place
he called the "ghost town." Gone were the china and crystal.
There were no facsimile machines or coffee pots, just
cardboard boxes filled with fired employees' belongings,
empty desks, and phones for those who had been let go to use
in seeking other employment.
   Particularly awkward, he says, were encounters on the way
to the cafeteria with those still working at First Boston. In
late May he was approaching the elevator when a colleague who
didn't know of his dismissal saw him leaving the dreaded
Floor 35 and asked, "Are you here?"
   "I'm here," Mr. Gookin said softly. "I'm here." To limit
conversation, he would take a sandwich to his desk and eat
alone.
   While there, he had plenty of time to think. The most
bitter of his thoughts is that he lost his job not by any
grand design, but by drawing an unlucky number in some
cost-cutter's lottery. As he sees it: "Somebody two boxes
over and one box up says we have to cut costs, and they
randomly go through the firm."
   Mr. Gookin says that some of his colleagues attended
nightly dinner parties, drove Porsches and viewed weekend
work as an intrusion on their skiing. His dismissal hurts all
the more because, he insists, with him work came first. He
says that his own vacations consisted of driving to Hilton
Head Island, and that he spent most of his free nights at
home with his family.
   But now, he says, there is no money even for Hilton Head.
He is earning spending money working on a temporary finance
project for a friend's business in San Francisco; he sleeps
in the friend's apartment. Though he is glad to be working,
even temporarily, he has had to put up with a painful
separation from his seven-year-old daughter, who remains in
Connecticut.
   As he interviews for another job -- competing against a
horde of similarly displaced investment bankers -- he is left
with only a few remnants of his former life: his Paul Stuart
suits, his tennis racket and his Range Rover. "I go to work
and I go home," he says. "Everything is on hold."

   FEARS STILL ABOUND of a disability law legal nightmare.
   As President Bush gets ready to sign the sweeping bill
banning discrimination against the handicapped, many
employers worry about lawsuits. Banking companies KeyCorp and
Society Corp., Ball Corp. and Oklahoma Publishing Co. warn of
possible jury trials and the threat of damages, fearing they
may eclipse conciliation.

   The law will be defined by the courts, but small firms can
ill afford big legal fees, complains the National Federation

won't be allowed to weed out job seekers who aren't up to
couriers' heavy lifting and driving tasks. But KeyCorp and
Texas Instruments figure it makes sense to accommodate
disabled workers.

spokeswoman reports.
                                                                                                       

   EARLY RETIREMENTS may often be dollar-foolish, but they
persist.
   Heavy pension and retiree health-care tabs make it 34%
costlier to retire workers 55 or older than to lay off ones
from 40 to 54, the National Foundation for Occupational and
Environmental Health Research finds, in a survey of data from
100 large firms. Early-out bonuses offered by one large firm
studied by the National Bureau of Economic Research are too
big to be offset by lowered future wage costs, the group
concludes.
   But efforts to curb early retirements confront employers'
zeal to trim the ages of their work forces and many workers'
eagerness to retire before 65, the Employee Benefit Research
Institute says. Still, a tight labor supply and cuts in
retiree health benefits may help keep workers on the job
longer, EBRI says.
                                                                                                       

   EXECUTIVES' HIGH PAY increasingly rankles the rank and
file.
   Boosts in top officials' salaries and bonuses breed unrest
among employees. "Salary-starved troops are looking on with
anger and cynicism as Mr. CEO's horse falls . . ., squashed
by the weight of his rider's bulging pockets," says Industry
Week. The magazine's poll has 62% of managers saying top
executive pay is too high.
   A study of 216 firms by consultant Sibson &amp; Co. shows
total compensation for top execs gaining an average 9.5% last
year, down from 10% rises in 1987 and 1988. "While the
compensation of corporate executives soared, worker pay
lagged behind inflation," says the AFL-CIO, in a paper titled
"Excessive Executive Pay."
   Lance Arrington, head of consultant Philip Crosby
Associates, says chief-executive pay is tied more to "the
CEO's relationship to the board" than the firm's profits.
                                                                                                       

   ALL OR MOST EMPLOYERS discriminate in hiring or
promotions, said 51% of 803 Americans polled by the National
Law Journal and Lexis reference service. Fully 62% would be
more willing to sue than five years ago. But of those who
said they had experienced job bias, only 2% saw a lawyer.
                                                                                                       

   WORKPLACE SMOKING CURBS get increased attention by states
and the local governments where smoke-restriction advocates
have more clout than tobacco interests. New Hampshire will
begin separating smokers in 1993. A commission urges
stiffening Maine's already-stringent law. Oregon groups will
try for a state curb, after two failures, and work for local
bans. Los Angeles and Montgomery County, Md., enact tough
anti-smoking laws.
                                                                                                       

   WAGE GAINS WIDENED through June 30, the Bureau of National
Affairs, a labor-reporting service, said. In 557 first-half
collective-bargaining settlements, covering 665,000 workers,
the median first-year wage boost was 3.9%, up from 3.5% a
year ago. Only 14% of pacts had lump-sum payments, down from
23%.
                                                                                                       

   HAIRCUTS GET CLIPPED as cost-trimming Upjohn Co. plans to
drop its in-house barbershops. The pharmaceutical maker plans
to close the subsidized shops at its Kalamazoo, Mich.,
headquarters and main plant by Dec 31. Upjohn has offered the
haircuts, now $8, since 1951.
                                                                                                       

   REGULATORY REVIVAL by federal labor-issue officials roils
some employers.
   Stepped-up job-safety, child-labor, pension and
immigration-rules enforcement sets companies such as Magma
Copper and PDQ Personnel Services complaining about paper
work and other burdens. The Labor Policy Association, a group
of large-company personnel chiefs, protests that large OSHA
fines for "egregious" violations were developed under a new
policy that ignored rulemaking requirements.
   Hormel says OSHA inspections are "more focused," but new
ergonomic guidelines "may impose problems." LaVal's Gardens,
a California pizza-parlor firm, says it paid $5,000 in
"ridiculous" child-labor fines. But Acmat Corp., Foxboro Co.
and Perini Corp. give OSHA high marks, and Perini finds new
pension rulings helpful, too.
   The OSHA crackdown is "long overdue" and will tell
employers "the stakes may be high" for violating safety
rules, says an AFL-CIO official.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Claude Messier, head of the asbestos miners
union in Asbestos, Quebec, quips, "If we die and are sent to
hell, at least we won't burn." . . . " Roger Smith {chairman}
of General Motors made only $2.5 million last year -- or
about the same as any ordinary baseball player who hits
.253," says Indianapolis News columnist Wendell Trogdon.

   Dear Philip Morris:
   Do You Really Mean It?

TOBACCO PRODUCTS (TOB)
</IN>
<LP>
   John R. Nelson, Philip Morris's vice president for
corporate affairs, presented the cigarette industry's
standard reply to assertions by critics that the industry
targets children for tobacco-product sales (Letters, June
12). It is heartening to see that Mr. Nelson agrees with
public-health authorities on several substantial matters. We
believe, however, that Philip Morris should back up its
policy with action.
   The areas of agreement are these: Children should not
smoke, and it is a good thing tobacco-product sales to people
below age 18 are generally against the law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Nelson goes even further when he says, "We at Philip
Morris do not want minors to smoke."
   Since Philip Morris does not want minors to smoke, its
sales to minors are unwanted, and its profits on sales to
minors are also unwanted. At a minimum, then, Philip Morris's
resolve to prevent children from using its tobacco products
should be measured by how it uses its unwanted profits from
sales to kids.
   How much is this? Mr. Nelson indicates that "A small
number of {the company's} cigarettes are unfortunately
obtained by minors."
   Given the enormous size of his company's cigarette sales,
Mr. Nelson can be forgiven the characterization of its sales
to underage people as "small." These only amounted to 1.5% of
cigarettes sold in the U.S. last year. Still, that's a
substantial number of smokes.
   We estimate that last year, 750 packs of Marlboros were
consumed by kids younger than 18 every minute, and Philip
Morris made a profit of $130 million for the year from these
largely illicit sales to the underage. While these numbers
are small compared with overall corporate performance, they
are substantially larger than the company's efforts to
prevent smoking by children.
   We invite Philip Morris to back up its policy: As a
minimum, the company should give its profits on mostly
illegal sales to the underage to state health departments
across the country to support programs for the prevention of
nicotine addiction among the young. Anything less has to be
regarded as window dressing.

   Kudos to George Melloan for his insightful essay on why
"Russia Hasn't Yet Tamed the Golden Hordes" (Global View,
June 18). I wondered, though, why he did not mention the
existence of the Birlik ("Unity") Popular Front Movement in
Uzbekistan, which now has a membership of well over half a
million.
   The rise of Birlik and other nationalist and pan-Islamic
movements in Western or Soviet-occupied Central Asia makes it
increasingly likely that what is happening now in Lithuania,
Latvia, Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine may soon be happening in
the five Soviet Moslem republics. What is little noticed is
the effect this is having upon China's Moslem population in
Eastern or Chinese-occupied Turkestan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The recent warming of relations between China and the
Soviet Union have in no small part been due to their shared
worry over emerging Islamic nationalism on both sides of
their common border. Chinese intelligence claims to have
identified no less than seven separatist organizations in
Xinjiang province, including the Committee for the Salvation
of East Turkestan and the Alliance for a Free Turkestan,
Mongolia, Manchuria and Tibet. The Soviets and Chinese share
a nightmare of these organizations linking up with those on
the Soviet side -- and indeed, this is just what is starting
to happen now. Birlik, for example, is increasing its efforts
to reach East Turkestan Moslems.
   The various peoples of East and West Turkestan share a
common ethnic and linguistic Turkic heritage as well as a
common cultural and religious Islamic base. There may well
soon emerge a movement to unite both regions into one
independent nation of Turkestan, with Xinjiang seceding from
China and the five Soviet Moslem republics seceding from the
U.S.S.R. The new country would be as large as Australia and
have a population of some 70 million. Once this is seen as a
quite possible future by the Central Asians, and by Moslems
around the world, neither Moscow nor Beijing may be able to
do much to prevent it.

   I would like to correct a historical error in Mr.
Melloan's otherwise-informative article. He writes: "Central
Asians helped the Bolsheviks overthrow Czar Nicholas II." The
Bolshevik coup did not occur until nearly seven months after
the czar's abdication on March 14, 1917. Significantly, the
two central figures in the Bolshevik takeover, Lenin and
Trotsky, were in exile at the time of the formation of the
broadly based Provisional government headed by Alexander
Kerensky, a non-Marxist Socialist.
   It was the German kaiser who provided the train in which
Lenin and his fellow conspirators passed through Europe to
the Finland Station. By helping Lenin return to Russia, the
German military high command, in Winston Churchill's words,
"deployed the most grisly of all weapons" against its Russian
enemy. The Germans supported Lenin hoping that he would
overthrow the Provisional government and make a separate
peace favorable to the former, as indeed happened. Lenin
wrote of the First Revolution: "In a few days, Russia was
transformed into a democratic, bourgeois Republic, more free
-- under wartime conditions -- than any other country in the
world." Meanwhile, Trotsky, together with hundreds of
like-minded revolutionaries, secured his return to Russia
from exile in North America.
   The Bolshevik coup was indeed a multiethnic enterprise.
Lenin, the first "Soviet Leader," was a Russian traitor. (To
his associates who complained of his cruelty to his fellow
countrymen, Lenin remarked: "I spit on Russia. . . . This is
merely one phase through which we must pass on the way to a
world revolution.") Trotsky, an apostate Jew, was a violent
anti-Zionist. Stalin, the new commissar of national
minorities, was a Georgian and a dropout from an Eastern
Orthodox seminary. The fanatic Pole, Felix Djerzhinski,
directed the newly formed security organization, the Cheka,
which unleashed the Red Terror with equal fury against
monarchists, liberals and democratic socialists.
   Although the Bolsheviks did not overthrow Czar Nicholas
II, they subsequently (under Lenin's orders) did murder him,
along with the czarina, their children and their servants.

CONGRESS (CNG)

   Far-reaching legislation that extends the power of the
federal government and burdens American business with new
costs cleared Congress Friday. But don't expect a
presidential veto. On the contrary, the bill, which bans
discrimination against the disabled, passed with President
Bush's strong encouragement. Now Mr. Bush is eager to sign it
into law.
   There's an echo of an earlier administration in this
episode, as there is in the president's reversal on raising
taxes -- Richard Nixon's. The Bush presidency is regularly
likened to Ronald Reagan's or Gerald Ford's, but it is the
Nixon model (pre-Watergate, of course) that Mr. Bush is
following. The result: a moderate-to-conservative president,
but liberal government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Confronted with a hostile Congress dominated by liberal
Democrats, the Nixon-Bush strategy calls for selective
endorsement of liberal themes. Mr. Nixon did this on civil
rights, arms control, detente with the Soviet Union, the
environment and taxes. Mr. Bush has done it on all these,
plus disabled rights, minimum wage and child care. There's an
understandable political motive behind the strategy. Mr. Bush
wants to neutralize liberal issues that might be used against
him in 1992. And he's succeeding at this quite well.
   There's a downside. The conservative agenda that is
supposed to be Mr. Bush's blueprint for government has fallen
by the wayside. This wasn't Mr. Bush's intention, but it was
inevitable, given his strategy. Congress, controlled by
liberals, has tossed aside conservative issues and seized on
liberal ones that Mr. Bush supports (and thus are easier to
pass). So the Americans with Disabilities Act, the disabled
rights bill, was approved by Congress overwhelmingly and
extension of the Clean Air Act is nearing passage. But a cut
in the tax rate on capital gains and a constitutional
amendment outlawing flag desecration were defeated. Democrats
can argue, correctly, that they've been bipartisan and met
Mr. Bush halfway. They gobbled up the liberal half.
   That doesn't mean that they've actually warmed up to Mr.
Bush or are willing to give him any credit. They didn't like
Mr. Nixon either, no matter what he did. "In many ways Nixon
turned out to be a liberal president, but one who infuriated
liberals in the process," writes political analyst Michael
Barone in "Our Country," a political history of the past 60
years. "It is hard to think of things the federal government
could do which it wasn't already doing under Nixon," Mr.
Barone says. Still, liberals "were not inclined to charge
with overliberalism."
   One source of their animosity was the way Mr. Nixon
campaigned. As a candidate, he pressed conservative hot
buttons -- crime, the flag, national defense. Mr. Bush did
the same in 1988, stigmatizing Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis as a liberal weenie. Once elected,
these campaign themes did not become mandates driving the
Bush administration -- defense is an exception to this rule.
But liberals nevertheless remain angry over the 1988
campaign.
   One legacy of the campaign, the "no new taxes" vow, was
kept alive by Mr. Bush for 17 months. Liberals regarded it as
demagogic, and they had a point. The tax pledge was merely an
appealing theme for the administration, not a policy. Mr.
Bush's 1991 budget, for example, included nearly $14 billion
in new tax revenues. Mr. Bush has refused to use his national
pulpit to press Congress for enactment of a capital-gains
cut. (Mr. Nixon campaigned as pro-business, then doubled the
capital-gains rate in 1969.) When the House Ways and Means
Committee passed a cut in 1989, this was a spontaneous action
of Republicans and conservative Democrats. Mr. Bush had given
them no encouragement.
   Because only liberal issues succeed under the Nixon-Bush
strategy, Mr. Bush has been forced underground to press
conservative issues. Now his chief vehicle for protecting a
reasonable level of Pentagon spending, seeking domestic
spending cuts or entitlement reform, and gaining budget
process changes is private talks with Democratic
congressional leaders. Just to get these talks going, Mr.
Bush had to pay a price. He was required to drop his "no new
taxes" pledge. Even so, he got no promise from Democrats of
concessions on conservative issues.
   By relying on private negotiations, Mr. Bush avoids the
need to be publicly confrontional. Mr. Reagan, in contrast,
relished confrontation, and so his strategy was different. He
stuck to the conservative agenda (lower taxes, less domestic
spending, more military spending, an assertive,
anti-communist foreign policy) and left liberal issues alone.
He produced conservative government for six years.
   In his last two years, Mr. Reagan faltered. He dabbled in
the Nixon strategy with disastrous results. In 1988, Mr.
Reagan proposed a catastrophic health insurance program.
Congress responded by expanding the size and cost of the
program, but Mr. Reagan signed the bill anyway. Soon, elderly
citizens were staging noisy protests against the costly new
premiums required by the program.
   That should have been a lesson to Mr. Bush, particularly
after a coalition of conservatives and moderates in Congress
rose up in 1989 and eliminated the program. It wasn't. At Mr.
Bush's behest, White House chief of staff John Sununu now is
desperately seeking a compromise with liberals on the 1990
Civil Rights Act. Mr. Bush insists he doesn't want a bill
that will lead to quotas. But he doesn't want to veto the
bill and alienate the black leaders he's been courting
either. His solution is to split the difference by weakening,
but retaining, a provision likely to promote quotas.
   Like so many of Mr. Bush's policies, his stand on civil
rights bears an eerie resemblance to Mr. Nixon's. Mr. Nixon
didn't like quotas either, but in 1969, his administration
approved the so-called Philadelphia Plan for building trades
unions. It set a quota for black membership, but called it a
goal. "It was under Nixon that first the executive branch and
then the Congress explicitly endorsed what amounted to a
racial quota," Mr. Barone points out.
   The same is true with clean air legislation. In 1969, Mr.
Nixon proposed the creation of the Environmental Protection
Agency. Now Mr. Bush has worked out a compromise with
congressional Democrats for widening the power of the agency
through revisions of the Clean Air Act. EPA also will be
raised to Cabinet status. The bill gives EPA authority to
issue permits to as many as 150,000 American businesses, from
small dry cleaning shops to large industries, depending on
how well they contain any of 191 air pollutants. Without an
EPA permit, the businesses will have to shut down.
   Mr. Reagan managed to thwart new anti-pollution measures
simply by refusing to play along. He won re-election anyway.
Mr. Reagan sent no major environmental legislation to
Congress in his eight years, and none passed. Mr. Bush could
have gotten by with this approach. (It might have worked on
disabled and civil rights, too.) Revisions of the Clean Air
Act are not needed. The air, after all, is getting cleaner,
not dirtier.
   One irony of the Bush strategy is that the leading
conservative in the White House, Mr. Sununu, may have
negotiated the three most liberal pieces of legislation to
pass Congress in a decade -- the clean air, disabled rights,
and civil rights bills. The first two are certain to become
law this year, and the civil rights bill has a better than
50-50 chance.
   In the face of a record like that, it is safe to say that
the Nixon-Bush approach is not serving Republicans or
conservatives well. It may backfire on Mr. Bush in 1992 as
well. Bush is well positioned to claim the political center,
but the right is a potential trouble spot. Conservatives are
increasingly upset with the consequences of Mr. Bush's
presidency. He may face a challenge for the GOP nomination in
1992 (as Mr. Nixon did in 1972). No doubt Mr. Bush will win
(as Mr. Nixon did), but the fight won't aid his re-election.
   Mr. Bush's strong suit now is foreign policy. "He's gotten
a once-in-a-lifetime halo effect from events abroad," says
GOP consultant Jeffrey Bell. Mr. Bush is following Nixon's
detente model and has developed strong ties to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev. But what if Mr. Gorbachev falls, and
events take a turn for the worse in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe? "A different trend abroad could bring a
surprisingly sudden reversal of his overall rating," argues
Mr. Bell.
   Mr. Nixon was saved in 1972 by having an extraordinarily
weak Democratic opponent, George McGovern. Mr. Bush may not
have that luxury. If Gov. Cuomo of New York announces early
next year for the Democratic nomination, he'll probably scare
off other candidates. Then, in 1992, he'd lead a united
Democratic party against divided Republicans. Would the folks
Mr. Bush has wooed with, say, the disabled rights bill, stick
with him against Mario Cuomo? Don't bet on it.

   PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America, hurt by sharply
lower aluminum ingot prices, reported that second-quarter
earnings fell 43% to $161.9 million, or $1.86 a share.
   A year earlier, Alcoa earned $285.2 million, or $3.21 a
share. Sales for the quarter fell slightly to $2.69 billion
from $2.76 billion in the 1989 second quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results, which were in line with analysts'
expectations, reflect a 24% drop in aluminum ingot prices,
Alcoa said.
   In addition, the results reflected revenue of only $6
million from the company's Brazilian affiliate, down from $61
million for the first half of 1989. The drop is linked to
actions taken by Brazil's government to improve that
country's economy. Lower fabricated activity also depressed
earnings.
   For the six months, Alcoa reported earnings of $310.5
million, or $3.55 a share, down from $561.2 million, or $6.33
a share, a year ago. Sales were $5.33 billion, down from
$5.38 billion.
   Earnings for the 1990 second quarter include favorable
translation and exchange adjustments of $9.9 million, or 11
cents a share, compared with $19.7 million, or 22 cents a
share, in the quarter the previous year. For the six months,
the favorable adjustments were $5.8 million, or seven cents a
share, compared with $20.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in
1989.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Alcoa closed
at $69.25, up 50 cents.

   PARIS -- French consumer prices in June rose a preliminary
0.2% from May and 3% from a year earlier, the National
Statistics Institute said.
   The June result matches May's monthly rise of 0.2% and
leaves the year-to-year inflation rate unchanged at 3%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest monthly rise was in line with estimates by
economists, who had expected price growth to remain broadly
under control in June, with the growth rates for most main
price categories showing little change from May. But the
stable year-to-year rate was slightly below previous
forecasts, which had generally called for a rise of 3.1%.

   Duval to Leave First Boston, Launch Firm

   NEW YORK -- A First Boston Corp. executive who played a
pivotal role in negotiating the firm's merger two years ago
is leaving, in the latest high-level management change at the
big securities firm.
   Michael Duval, a managing director, will depart this week
to launch a small investment banking boutique specializing in
international merger deals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 52-year-old Mr. Duval helped structure First Boston's
merger with its bigger Credit Suisse First Boston affiliate
in 1988; that move effectively gave control of First Boston
to Credit Suisse, the giant Swiss bank. A former president of
First Boston's real estate unit and once the firm's No. 5
executive, he was removed from its management committee this
year, after John Hennessy took over as president and chief
executive officer.
   In an internal notice to employees, Mr. Hennessy said Mr.
Duval "has made an outstanding contribution to the firm,
especially in our merger and privatization transactions, as
well as in our compliance efforts."
   Despite his clipped wings, Mr. Duval's departure is a blow
to First Boston. The firm, battered in the past year by
turmoil stemming from the collapse of the high-yield,
below-investment-grade "junk" bond market, has slipped
recently in Wall Street's underwriting rankings. The
securities firm earned just $11 million last year.
   Since the merger, a number of traders and executives have
departed. In June, First Boston lost David C. Batten -- he
had been a managing director since 1978 and played a major
role in building the firm's corporate finance business -- to
Blackstone Group. Other recent defections included the
government-bond trading head, David Bunting, and several
other traders, moves triggered by a bond trading shake-up at
the firm. Earlier this year, William E. Mayer, First Boston's
chief executive, was bumped aside to head a new merchant
banking unit at the firm.
   A First Boston spokesman declined to elaborate on the
internal memo about Mr. Duval's resignation.
   Mr. Duval, meanwhile, has agreed to be a consultant to
First Boston on Washington issues, including international
banking and tax matters. He is known as much in political
circles as in the securities arena. In the late 1960s, he was
an attorney with the U.S. Transportation Department and
joined the White House staff in 1970. Appointed special
counsel to President Gerald Ford in 1974, he helped develop
Mr. Ford's economic and energy policies.
   While Mr. Duval wasn't widely known to the public, he was
an important behind-the-scenes investment banker at First
Boston. Within the firm, he is best known for structuring and
negotiating the merger between First Boston and Credit
Suisse, a deal that took the securities firm private. First
Boston's parent, CS First Boston Inc., is 44.5%-owned by CS
Holding, which owns Credit Suisse.
   Mr. Duval joined First Boston in 1984 after seven years at
Mead Corp., where he was senior vice president and chief
strategic officer. Among other things, Mr. Duval played a
major role in Mead's strategic restructuring.
   His new venture, named the Duval Group, will focus on an
area Mr. Duval sees burgeoning in the 1990s: international
mergers between companies driven by strategic concerns. For
the next few months, Mr. Duval will hammer out financial
backing for the venture, which he expects to launch in
January; he will start with about two dozen professionals.
   "The opportunity here is to build the venture myself and
have a major ownership in it," Mr. Duval said. "That's an
opportunity First Boston couldn't offer me."
   Among his other jobs, Mr. Duval was a top executive in
First Boston's compliance area. The firm's general counsel,
Michael Zeiss, now will report to Mr. Hennessy, instead of
Mr. Duval, according to the internal notice to employees. A
successor to Mr. Duval isn't likely to be named.

   LONDON -- Industrial production fell 0.5% in May from
April levels and was up 3.1% from May 1989, according to
provisional data released yesterday by the U.K. Central
Statistical Office.
   Output in the energy sector, which can vary greatly with
swings in the oil market, fell 2.5% in May from April and was
up 6.8% from a year earlier. The latest figures compare with
April's 1.6% month-on-month rise and 1.2% year-on-year fall.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Output in all industries rose 1.6% in the three months
ended in May from the preceding three months and was up 1.7%
from a year earlier.
   Output for manufacturing alone in the latest three months
was up 1.7% from the previous three months and was also up
1.7% from a year earlier.
   The statistical office said the rise in manufacturing
output was the first increase since January 1989. Meanwhile,
it noted energy production had fallen largely because of the
spate of warm weather earlier this year.

   `Tire King' Wins:
   Merchant Defeats
   Vietnam Dogma

   HANOI -- In his own quiet way, Nguyen Van Chan revels in
the fact that he has beaten the system.
   The system in question is that practiced by the Vietnamese
Communist Party in this nation of 66 million. Like all
totalitarian systems, it is at times tyrannical, abusive and
arbitrary. Despite extensive political, social and economic
reforms it remains a system of men and caprice rather than
one of institutions and principle.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Chan, 65, is one of its better-known victims. The
majority of the tormented have remained anonymous, suffering
out of sight. But for various reasons, though mostly luck,
Mr. Chan became a cause celebre at home and abroad, and that
accounts in large measure for his success against the system.
   Largely uneducated, Mr. Chan has an entrepreneurial flair,
but he had the misfortune to try to put his natural business
instincts to work in Hanoi at a time when socialist
principles required everyone to live equally, usually in
poverty.
   First, he invented a fountain pen that he and his family
produced from plastic waste. Later, he marketed glue that he
developed to enable him to make rubber sandals. Both his pens
and his glue were immensely popular, for the simple reason
that they worked better than what came off the government
production line.
   For his troubles, Mr. Chan was jailed three times between
1960 and 1974. His operation was properly registered and used
only scrap, yet he was accused of conducting illegal business
and possessing illegal materials. On one occasion he was held
for three months without being charged.
   Undeterred, he graduated to heavy-duty bicycle tires,
finally producing one that, once again, easily outlasted its
state-produced rival. By 1982, he was selling thousands of
tires. Newspapers published articles about him, and he was
widely hailed as "the tire king." His efforts earned a gold
medal at a national exhibition -- and attracted renewed envy
and attention from local authorities.
   In familiar fashion, district police in 1983 descended on
Mr. Chan's suburban home, which he and his large family used
as both residence and factory, and demanded proof that the
house and equipment were his. "When I proved that everything
was legal, that was the first time that they lost and I won,"
he says.
   Invited to the district police station, he was required to
explain the production process step by step, supposedly to
show whether he was a real working man or an exploiter. "When
I showed it was from my own brain, they lost for the second
time," he says.
   Nevertheless, a few days later the police accused him of
stealing electricity, acquiring rubber without permission and
buying stolen socialist property. Warned that he was to be
jailed again, he fled to the countryside while firing off
protests to higher authorities. His family was given only
three hours to leave before the house and contents were
confiscated.
   After six months on the run, Mr. Chan learned that the
order for his arrest had been canceled. He rejoined his
family in January 1984 and began a long struggle for justice.
Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 when an
investigative reporter, capitalizing on reforms then being
introduced, got Mr. Chan's story published in a weekly
newspaper. In 1988, 18 months after the Communist Party's
sixth congress endorsed family-run private enterprise,
district authorities allowed him to resume work, but they
released only one of his machines, and they didn't return his
rubber stocks or his house.
   Although he was invited back to display his products at a
national exhibition in late 1988, and many of the country's
leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements as
an example of private initiative, he wasn't satisfied. He
wanted his property -- and his "dignity" -- back.
   When I met Mr. Chan at his son's home in Hanoi in April
1989, he was about to mount his bicycle to deliver yet
another petition to district officials. His wife was in
tears, and fearful of the consequences. But a determined Mr.
Chan assured me, "I will win. They will lose a third time."
   Finally, after seven long years, he did triumph. Early
this year, newly installed district officials handed back his
house keys, apologized for the misdeeds of their predecessors
and promised to pay him 200 taels of gold valued at $90,000
for irrecoverable stock and personal possessions.
   Now his business is flourishing, with branches in Ho Chi
Minh City. His company is turning out motor bikes as well as
bicycle tires, and starting to generate big profits with
heat-resistant rubber belts for use in electricity
generators. Other new products on the way include tires for
small cars.
   For the benefit of those who weren't around to share his
moments of victory, Mr. Chan has made a video that shows his
family's return to the house, which the authorities had used
as a health clinic. Neighbors greet them with exploding
firecrackers, and help them clean the yard and scrub interior
walls and furniture.
   One of the first things Mr. Chan did when he settled in
was to throw a party for all his friends who had stood by him
in his darkest hours. In the video, he introduces them to the
camera: This one hid him from the police; that one allowed
her place to be used as a mail drop so that he could keep
contact with his family while on the run.
   If Mr. Chan's experience has led him to question the
system that he has battled for half a lifetime, he stays
silent about it. He is philosophical. "I am fortunate," he
says. "The wheel of history keeps turning."

   Over-the-counter stocks posted their fourth straight gain
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average flirted with the 3000
mark.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.16 to 469.60, a 0.5%
advance, but still remains below a high of 485.73 set last
Oct. 9. Volume dropped to 138.1 million shares from 160.6
million Friday as advancing shares trailed decliners, 946 to
969.

<TEXT>
   Mirroring this year's trends in the OTC market, technology
stocks gained but financial issues sagged, felled partly by a
steep plunge in International Holding Capital. Shares of the
Honolulu thrift fell 8 to 17 after it announced that Sumix
Corp. failed to gain timely approval from the Office of
Thrift Supervision for a merger of the two thrifts. Three of
Nasdaq's four financial indexes fell slightly.
   "It's a very splintered market," said Richard Bruno, head
of OTC trading at PaineWebber. Mr. Bruno said he continued to
see strong interest in technology and biotechnology shares,
while investors largely shunned financial stocks. "I wouldn't
jump in with both feet and buy everything that's for sale,"
he said, adding that investors continue to be selective.
   At A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, small investors are
returning to OTC stocks, according to William Sulya, director
of OTC trading. In the last few trading sessions, Mr. Sulya
said prospects of lower interest rates has attracted
individual and institutional investors to stocks among all
industry groups. He added, however, that small investors seem
to be attracted only to "quality names" with strong
operations.
   Technology shares were mixed. Intel added 1 1/4 to 51 1/4;
Microsoft advanced 7/8 to 79 1/4, and Lotus climbed 1 to 33
3/4. However, Oracle Systems, continuing to lose ground after
last week's earnings report, eased 3/8 to 18 3/8 and was the
day's most-active issue. Apple Computer dropped 1 1/8 to 45
5/8.
   The Nasdaq 100 Index of larger stocks, including many
technology issues, rose 2.88 to 492.36.
   Micropolis jumped 1 1/16 to 9, a new 52-week high, on more
than three times average volume. The Chatsworth, Calif.,
maker of high-capacity disk drives reported net income for
the second quarter ended June 29 of 20 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss of 92 cents a share.
   American Depositary Receipts of Telefonos de Mexico,
Mexico's government-subsidized telephone company, were among
the day's most-active issues, with more than 4 million ADRs
changing hands at 1 23/32, unchanged from the previous close.
Among other communications issues, MCI Communications gained
1/2 to 40, leading a 0.6% gain in the Nasdaq Utility Index.
   Other active stocks included Class A shares of
Tele-Communications, which rose 5/8 to 15 1/8. A week ago,
the Denver cable television company offered three million
Class A shares at $14.25 apiece.
   Nike raced to yet another new 52-week high, as shares of
the athletic footwear maker surged 2 1/4 to 94.
   Shares of Goulds Pumps continued to climb on takeover
speculation, although a company official flatly denied rumors
that Britain's BTR PLC made an offer for the Seneca Falls,
N.Y., maker of centrifugal liquid holding pumps. Investor
relations liaison James A. Nelson told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report the company hasn't had any acquisition offers
and "has no interest whatsoever" in being acquired. Gould
rose 1 to 26 on nearly 1.1 million shares, more than six
times average volume. The stock was active last week on
similar rumors.
   Mr. Nelson said that second-quarter earnings are due to be
reported July 23 and added that he's comfortable with
consensus estimates the company will earn 40 cents a share,
up from 39 cents a year earlier, and $1.49 for the full year,
up from $1.41 in 1989.
   Industrial Funding Class A shares plunged 3 5/8 to 5 7/8
after the provider of capital equipment leases reported a
loss for the second quarter ended May 31 of three cents a
share, compared with net income of 18 cents a year earlier.
   C-Cor Electronics lost 1 to 9 1/4 after the State College,
Pa., maker of cable-television equipment said it plans to lay
off about 90 workers at two Pennsylvania plants. C-Cor cited
weak orders due to uncertainty about regulation of the cable
television industry.
   Westmark International tumbled 2 7/8 to 38 3/4. Anne Marie
Bugge, vice president of investor relations for the Seattle
maker of medical equipment, told DJPIR the fall was an
"overreaction" to the introduction of a new ultrasound system
by a competitor, Acuson Corp. of Mountain View, Calif.
   Multimedia fell 7/8 to 69 5/8. A 400,000-share block
representing about 3.5% of the Greenville, S.C., media
company traded early in the day.

   Southland Agrees With Japanese Suitor,
   Bondholder Panel on Restructuring Plan

   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said it agreed in principle on a
fourth restructuring proposal with its bondholders' steering
committee and a Japanese suitor, averting a possible
bankruptcy-law filing and avoiding a showdown over late
interest payments.
   The agreement changes significantly the details of a
debt-exchange offer from the company this month, increasing
the face value of the publicly held bonds offered in exchange
for current bonds while reducing the interest rates. The
accord also increases the cash infusion by Ito-Yokado Co. to
$430 million from $400 million and reduces the equity
retained by the founding Thompson family.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This year, Ito-Yokado, operator of 7-Eleven stores in
Japan, offered to buy 75% of the company, contingent on a
restructuring of Southland's debt and preferred. Yesterday's
agreement reduces that stake to 70%.
   Southland, the troubled parent of the 7-Eleven retail
convenience stores, had said that it didn't intend to make a
June 15 interest payment on its senior subordinated debt.
That payment officially went into default Sunday. Without an
agreement with senior debtholders, the company could have
been forced into bankruptcy proceedings yesterday.
   This plan is the fourth restructuring proposal written by
the company this year, but it is the first accepted by the
bondholders' committee, which represents about 70% of the
public debtholders. The latest proposal reduces the equity of
existing shareholders including the Thompson family to about
5% from 6.5% in the third proposal and 15% in the original
plan. And while reducing Ito-Yokado's equity to 70%, the
proposal gives bondholders about 25% of the company's common,
up from 18.5% in the third proposal.
   Acknowledging that the bondholders took "meaningful
haircuts" in this restructuring proposal, bondholder
committee chairman John Gordon of Deltec Securities Corp.
said the proposal gives them "as much as they could
reasonably expect to get" out of the restructuring. "All of
us are very enthusiastic about what the new owners will be
able to do with this business," said Mr. Gordon. He said the
proposal increased the value of the exchange offer to
bondholders by about 15% and was unanimously approved by the
committee.
   All bondholders weren't pleased, though. "I'm not happy,"
said George Nicholas, a Dallas holder of some of the
company's 15 3/4% and 16 3/4% bonds who filed suit against
Southland in a Dallas County court yesterday, seeking payment
of the interest due June 15. The new agreement doesn't change
his sentiments, he said. "It's supposedly a great deal for
us, but it's just smoke and mirrors to me," he said. Mr.
Nicholas said the deal cuts interest payments on his bonds to
about one-third of the original levels, and although it
increases the face value of the notes, the new proposal
raises the value of the deal by "not much more than a couple
of cents."
   The exchange offer still requires the approval of numerous
creditors, preferred stockholders and banks. The company said
it will file its prospectus for the debt exchange with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as possible and
hopes to complete the debt restructuring by mid-August.
   Southland, which owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other
convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went private in a
$4.9 billion leveraged buy-out in late 1987 to avoid a
possible hostile bid by the Belzberg family of Canada.
Increased competition eroded sales and profit margins and
made it difficult for the company to service the huge debt
from the buy-out.

   Tapie Discloses Loan Package to Raise
   $289 Million to Buy 80% of Adidas AG

   PARIS -- Bernard Tapie, announcing details of his plan to
buy 80% of Adidas AG, said he is paying 1.6 billion francs
($289 million). But he also disclosed he will have to pump in
as much as one billion francs more to bolster the capital of
the ailing West German sporting-goods concern.
   Analysts had valued all of Adidas at around three billion
francs. Mr. Tapie has insisted that he received a special
price.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Tapie also disclosed that he is raising all the 1.6
billion francs through a package of one-year and two-year
loans from eight French, West German and Japanese banks. He
initially said only half the money would come from loans, and
the other half from other sources, such as asset sales by his
holding company, Bernard Tapie Finance S.A. Mr. Tapie's
statement said no such sales have been arranged.
   The statement outlining the price and financing plans
quieted worries that the flamboyant financier would have
trouble paying for Adidas, which will cost him nearly twice
Bernard Tapie Finance's 889 million-franc market
capitalization. But it also indicated that the loans'
repayment will depend on Adidas generating funds by rapidly
returning to profit. It also will depend on raising 600
million francs for Bernard Tapie Finance, half through a
stock issue and half through a bond issue.
   Last year, Adidas reportedly posted a 120 million mark
($72 million) loss on 4.6 billion marks in sales. This year,
Mr. Tapie said, he expects an Adidas net income of 70 million
francs to 100 million francs. Banking people say he expects
even more Adidas profit in 1991.
   Mr. Tapie didn't say how he will raise the one billion
francs in new Adidas capital. Banking people said he may well
sell some of his Adidas stake to new shareholders, which
could include some of the banks backing the purchase.
   Mr. Tapie's statement said the Adidas capital boost is
needed because the company's bad 1989 results had pushed debt
too high compared to capital. It didn't provide figures.
   Mr. Tapie's statement said he doesn't intend to sell any
major Adidas assets, lay off any workers or close any major
industrial sites, aside from changes already decided by
current management. But he told a radio interviewer that he
will need to restructure Adidas to make it more competitive,
and banking people said he may have to sell some
subsidiaries.
   Philippe Migeot, deputy managing director of Mr. Tapie's
lead bank, Credit Lyonnais subsidiary Societe de Banque
Occidentale, said one billion francs of the loan is repayable
in two years, while 600 million francs is repayable in one
year.
   The one-year loan is to be repaid through a 300 million
franc share issue and a 300 million franc bond issue for
Bernard Tapie Finance. Mr. Tapie told his bankers he intends
to buy most of the new shares himself to keep his current
controlling 57% stake in Bernard Tapie Finance. It couldn't
be learned how he would raise the money to do that.
   The one billion franc two-year loan is to be repaid
through Adidas earnings, Bernard Tapie Finance earnings, and,
if necessary, asset sales, Mr. Migeot said. Last year,
however, Bernard Tapie Finance's consolidated net income fell
54% to just 27.7 million francs.
   French stock market regulators, criticial of Mr. Tapie's
earlier failure to explain how he would finance the
acquisition, had ordered trading in Bernard Tapie Finance
suspended last week. After the release of Mr. Tapie's
statement, they said the shares could resume trading, as of
today.

   To Break Even
   In Its Fiscal Year

   Campbell Soup Co. said it expects to break even in the
year ending July 29, reflecting continued troubles overseas
and recent weakness in several product categories.
   The projected results include a fourth-quarter charge of
$302 million, or $2.33 a share, for plant closures and
businesses put up for sale.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fiscal 1989, the Camden, N.J., food company posted net
income of $13.1 million, or 10 cents a share, including a
charge of $201 million, or $2.02 a share, for a restructuring
begun in August.
   Speaking to securities analysts in New York, Campbell
Chief Executive David W. Johnson said per-share operating
earnings for the year would be about $2.33 to $2.35,
significantly below analysts' estimates of $2.50 to $2.60.
   In an apparent attempt to quell takeover rumors, Mr.
Johnson also said he believes members of Campbell's
controlling Dorrance family, who own 41% of the stock, are
opposed to a takeover.
   Responding to a question, Mr. Johnson said two previously
undecided family members, Charlotte Weber and Tristram Colket
Jr., now favor independence, joining four cousins who have
disclosed their opposition to a sale.
   "Charlotte and Tris have, as far as I'm concerned, shown a
move to the other line," Mr. Johnson said.
   Mr. Johnson cited continuing problems at Campbell's
Italian cookie business and some British frozen-food
operations as major reasons for Campbell's disappointing
financial performance. Campbell put both units up for sale
earlier this year.
   In the current quarter, Campbell has also lost market
share in three U.S. food categories: dry soup, red-and-white
condensed soup and Le Menu frozen entrees.
   But Mr. Johnson predicted that Campbell's earnings would
soon resurge. Over the next few years, he said, the company
will seek to achieve 20% annual growth in earnings, 20%
return on equity and 20% cash return on assets. Mr. Johnson
vowed to "make Campbell a premier performer in the peer group
of food companies."
   In composite trading Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Campbell shares fell 12.5 cents to $55.875.
   Separately, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered its rating on
Campbell's senior debt to double-A from triple-A and affirmed
the company's A-1-plus commercial paper rating, affecting
about $500 million of debt.
   In reducing the rating, S&amp;P cited Campbell's recent
operating results, "balance sheet deterioration" and possible
changes in family ownership of the company. In addition,
"uncertainties exist about when and whether operations will
again reach levels consistent with the highest rating," S&amp;P
said.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. also lowered its rating on
Campbell's long-term debt to double-A-2 from triple-A.

   International Business Machines Corp. reported a solid
5.2% increase in second-quarter earnings, the first time
since the mid-1980s that the company has put together
respectable quarters back to back.
   "While first-half results are encouraging, much remains to
be done this year," IBM Chairman John Akers said in a
statement that was slightly more measured than the one that
accompanied the first-quarter earnings report.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   IBM did exceed securities analysts' expectations for the
second consecutive quarter, reporting net income of $1.41
billion, or $2.45 a share, while analysts had generally
estimated $2.25 to $2.35 a share. A year earlier, IBM earned
$1.34 billion, or $2.31 a share. (Per-share earnings grew
faster than the total figure because IBM has been buying back
shares, cutting the average number outstanding to 573.3
million from 581.4 million a year earlier.) Revenue climbed a
surprisingly strong 8.4%, to $16.5 billion from $15.21
billion.
   The biggest surprise in the quarter was the strength of
software revenue, which grew 26% to $2.35 billion. Although
software revenue had increased a heady 30% to 35% for years,
growth had recently slowed into the single digits as IBM had
begun providing hefty discounts on software as a way of
increasing hardware sales. IBM indicated that the strong
showing was an aberration but suggested that percentage
increases in the mid-teens were possible in the second half.
   IBM said results continued to be good in personal
computers, where IBM has been gaining market share for the
past year and a half. Demand also remained strong for a line
of high-end disk drives that IBM began shipping late last
year. IBM also singled out for praise the AS/400, a line of
minicomputers that had been going gangbusters since its
introduction two years ago but that had finally seemed to be
losing momentum in the first quarter.
   Revenue rose again in the U.S., even though the whole
computer industry has been having trouble here for years --
although the increase was apparently in the low single
digits, as opposed to the double-digit growth of the first
quarter and the 1989 second quarter.
   IBM also said it is seeing some early benefits from a
job-reduction and plant-consolidation program that occasioned
a $2.4 billion write-off in the 1989 fourth quarter. Benefits
from the program are expected to really start to show up in
the second half.
   At the same time, IBM acknowledged that 20 cents a share
of the latest quarter's earnings came from the drop in the
dollar -- because IBM does nearly 60% of its business
overseas, and a drop increases the value of that business
when it is translated into dollars.
   In addition, operating profit margins were disappointing.
Profit before taxes, interest expense and other income was
just 15.7% of revenue, while many securities analysts had
been predicting the margin would be at least half a
percentage point higher. The difference apparently came
because a heavier-than-expected percentage of revenue came
from products such as personal computers, where profit
margins are lower than on the big systems.
   The decline in mainframe revenue wasn't a big surprise,
given that a manufacturing problem in the 1989 first quarter
packed far more deliveries into last year's second quarter
than are normal. Still, IBM indicated that second-quarter
mainframe revenue was flat compared with this year's first
quarter -- even though the second quarter typically accounts
for 25% of mainframe revenue and the first 15%.
   In the first half, IBM earned $2.45 billion, or $4.26 a
share, up 6.8% from $2.29 billion, or $3.92 a share. Revenue
climbed 9.8% to $30.68 billion from $27.94 billion.

   The disintegration of the Soviet Communist Party continues
apace. At an ostensibly rebellious Party Congress, Mikhail
Gorbachev arranged to have himself re-elected General
Secretary, and secured a rubber stamp on his plans to reduce
the party's role. Then Boris Yeltsin, president of the
Russian Federation parliament, announced his resignation from
the party and dramatically strode out of the congress.
Gavriil Popov and Anatoly Sobchak, mayors of Moscow and
Leningrad respectively, followed him in resignation, as have
and will many others in the party rank and file. Now some
50,000 people assembled outside the Kremlin in opposition to
the party, and Mr. Gorbachev commanded it to give up its
total control of radio and television.
   The message is reaching even into the U.S. State
Department. Stopping in Ireland on his way to receive a
briefing on the Party Congress from Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, Secretary of State Baker opined that the U.S.
government might actually start to talk to the likes of
Yeltsin-Popov-Sobchak if they get around to forming an
official opposition party. Maybe State will even succeed in
discovering that these three have all been voted into office
in popular elections, unlike Mr. Gorbachev and other
central-government officials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev's new governmental architecture
raises some interesting questions of political authority.
Chief of State Gorbachev inherits the power taken away from
General Secretary Gorbachev. On paper, President Gorbachev
has far more power. The military and KGB now will report
directly to the president and will be less answerable to the
party. Party cells already are being removed from factories,
putting heads of enterprises directly under presidential
authority.
   Mr. Gorbachev will leave party duties to his
unprepossessing choice for deputy general secretary, Vladimir
Ivashko. The central committee's Politburo, once the supreme
power in the Soviet Union, will become a debating society. It
now will meet only once a month. Mr. Shevardnadze and other
key ministers saw no need to remain members.
   Mikhail Gorbachev has chosen to try to rule the Soviet
Union through the presidency, rather than the party. But now
that he has created a dictatorial presidency, a question
arises: Will anyone do what he dictates? Clearly he has
cleverly positioned himself in anticipation of the party's
rapid decline, leaving open the possibility that he himself
can defect when the time is ripe. But where will he get his
political authority meanwhile?
   He was not elected president by the people, but by a
Supreme Soviet carefully packed with Communists. He is not as
popular with the people as Mr. Yeltsin appears to be,
although Mr. Yeltsin's popularity probably derives more from
his anti-party campaign than from a widespread belief that he
can deliver the people from their misery.
   Mr. Gorbachev still will derive some authority from the
party -- until it withers away. Some will continue to come
from the Supreme Soviet, although this legislative body also
will suffer from the rising public anger at communism. That
will make Mr. Gorbachev more dependent on the military and
the KGB as he tries to maintain public order.
   But the army and quite possibly the KGB as well are
themselves suffering deep inner divisions over who exactly
has authority. Generals of the army by and large supported
Communist hard-liners in the congress, but there is
increasing evidence that the rank and file leans toward the
reformers. Some of the rank and file, of course, come from
secessionist-minded republics and don't like anything
Russian. So when President Gorbachev issues orders, can he be
certain they will be obeyed now that party discipline in
these two powerful institutions has been weakened?
   Some of those thoughts no doubt crossed Mr. Gorbachev's
mind when he watched Mr. Yeltsin walk out. That no doubt
explains why he reacted so bitterly. Perhaps he was tempted
to also shed the party albatross. But that he couldn't do.
Mr. Gorbachev will stay put and will need all his
considerable political skills to withstand the forces of
revolution now raging in the Soviet Union.

   No one should make the mistake of thinking that all the
politicians intent on soaking taxpayers for more live in the
nation's capital, New York, New Jersey or Massachusetts. The
tax drama continues out West.
   The California budget battle is coming to a head. But any

real-estate prices and crime, better take note of
developments in a few nearby havens.

   Most strikingly, Arizona completed a fitful legislative
session of its own recently by effectively raising income,
property and excise taxes instead of curbing spending.
Republicans engineered this one. The $265 million package
squeezed through when go-along, get-along Republican leaders
of the Legislature ignored their conservative backbenchers
and bought off enough Democrats with spending sops to
assemble a majority.
   The performance earned poor reviews, including a
"wretched" from the increasingly tax-hostile Arizona Republic
newspaper. The state's tumultuous politics are likely to
continue through the September GOP primary, in which the
tax-flaying former (and impeached) governor, Evan Mecham
faces four foes for governor. Indeed in November, voters may
toss the Republicans out of legislative control after 24
years.
   Arizona's changes actually lower the top personal
income-tax rate to 7% from 8%. But by eliminating deductions,
the politicians aim to make the tax burden more progressive
and reclaim for state government the revenue windfall from
the 1986 federal tax revision. The legislation also will
repeal indexing of tax brackets. Business groups are
marshaling to pass a November initiative rescinding the tax
hikes.
   The partisan dividing line is clearer in Colorado, where a
limitation on spending and taxation is due for a November
vote. In that state, Republicans have already cast their lot,
with libertarian-conservative John Andrews trying to oust
Democrat Governor Roy Romer. Mr. Andrews's platform includes
Amendent 1, the taxpayer-relief effort.
   Six counties in the Denver area may provide a clue to the
outcome when they vote next month on a sales-tax increase to
build a stadium to lure a baseball franchise. Phoenix is
vying for the same expansion club, but the Arizona
Legislature, in another of its windup acts, voted to allow
Maricopa County to impose a stadium sales-tax hike without
putting the move to a public vote. (A number of obligations
and tax bites were shifted to the local level in Arizona,
otherwise the state boost would have been larger.)
   Arizona competes most directly with the Las Vegas area for
jobs fleeing Southern California, so you'd think Nevada would
gain from its southern neighbor's follies. That may indeed
turn out to be the case. Democrat Governor Bob Miller talks
of hiking taxes only on the mining industry, which is
prospering in the northern part of the state. But rapid
growth has left some public facilities lagging, so the school
lobby has placed a November ballot initiative to impose an 8%
to 10% corporate income tax. The absence of such a tax has
helped Nevada recruit business.
   Once again, of course, Arizona isn't going to be outdone
in the revenue-raising competition. The education
establishment there has its own gambit on the November
ballot, to raise spending per pupil by $100 a year for a
decade.
   It should be a bronco-bucking few months ahead for
taxpayers in the wild, wild West. Tax advocates may persist
in saying there is opinion-poll support for all this. We
continue to think the politicians are getting close to
stirring up another tax revolt.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Magazines Fail to Shake Slump
   As Tobacco, Car Ads Slip Further

   Magazine publishers, known for their boundless optimism,
insisted the slump that hit most titles in the first quarter
was an aberration. Sure, things were tough, they said, but
slow first quarters are part of the business.
   Well, the first-half numbers from Publishers Information
Bureau, which tracks both large and small consumer magazines,
will be released today. Publishers will have to think up a
new excuse this time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Advertising pages dropped 4% in June and 3.3% for the
first six months, compared with the year earlier periods, the
PIB figures show. And the numbers show something more
disturbing: The falloff in important ad categories such as
automotive and cigarette and tobacco has accelerated from the
first quarter.
   Automotive, the largest category at $415 million, went
from being down 7.4% in the first quarter to being down 12.5%
in the first half; cigarette's deficit grew from 25% to 27%
in the same period.
   As a scoreboard for the industry, the numbers paint a
bleak picture, with almost no indication of a rebound.
National advertisers have already made their media placements
through September, says Nancy W. Smith, director of media
services at Young &amp; Rubicam. "I wish I weren't seeing this,"
she says. "I don't see anything in the cards that will change
things."
   The slump stems from a general economic slowdown, but has
been exacerbated by the straits of major magazine advertisers
such as retailers and car companies. In a double hit, ad
dollars are also being snapped up by competitive media. "Most
ad budgets are flat this year," says Michael Drexler,
executive vice president at Bozell. "But if they are up, the
increases are going to TV rate increases or to cable TV,
which continues to absorb a greater part of the ad revenue
pie."
   Magazines have weathered down cycles before. But now the
concern is no longer focused on when the good times will
return, but rather just how many magazines will be left
standing when they do.
   In this slump, the magazines most likely to fold will be
those that have artificially inflated their circulations with
discounts and giveaways. "If you are giving away circulation,
you will be a victim of a very bad economic climate," says
Mr. Drexler. "And if you are second or third in your
category, it's going to get tougher." Among the magazines
that use discounts the most are women's service books along
with second-tier women's fashion and sports magazines.
   But the industry's mass-circulation heavyweights are
reeling, too, although many had expected a rebound by now. A
number of publishers that had predicted moderate gains in
1990 are now saying they will consider it a victory if their
ad pages are flat this year.
   Some of the hardest-hit books include the major weeklies.
Time Warner's People was down 10% and Time was down 8% for
the first half. Other weeklies that saw big declines were
McGraw-Hill's Business Week, down 8.5%; News Corp.'s TV
Guide, down 10%; and Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek, down 9%.
   There were some notable success stories in the face of an
otherwise miserable first half. Conde Nast's HG (formerly
House and Garden) is up 20%, after recovering from a
near-disastrous name change, and Vanity Fair is up 3%, not
bad for a general interest magazine. Conde Nast is a unit of
Advance Publications. Forbes magazine logged an 8.2% increase
in the business magazine field, one of the most competitive
in the industry.
   Some advertiser groups showed signs of life, too.
Advertising revenue for travel, hotels and resorts increased
4% for the first half, toiletries and cosmetics ad revenue
grew 6%, and the food products category increased 11%.
   But those bright spots were few and far between, and not
many publishing executives disagree that a magazine shakeout
is in full effect. The list of dead magazines is growing, and
spans those with city or regional circulation and those with
national readership.
   The most recent casualties are Weider Health &amp; Fitness
Corp.'s Moxie, a national magazine for older women, and
Pennington Publishing Inc.'s Cook's, an upscale epicurean
magazine. Their demise follows that of several regional
titles, such as Metrocorp's Manhattan, inc., CMP
Publications' Long Island Monthly, Stern Publications' 7
Days, and Time Warner's Southpoint.
   "The recession in advertising and media hit first on local
media, then spread to national," says John Suhler, president
of Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates, a media brokerage firm in
New York. "Advertisers have reacted for two years" and will
for two years to come, he says.
   The question now is which "franchise" magazines --
established, revenue-churning titles -- will feel the heat.
Because of parent Hachette S.A.'s debt problems, for example,
Diamandis Communications Inc. has been forced to put its
Woman's Day on the block.
   Industry optimists point to statistics compiled by Samir
Husni, a University of Mississippi professor, showing that
new magazines are sprouting everywhere: 584 new ones in 1989
compared with 231 in 1985. But most of those are
small-circulation, narrow-interest magazines -- the type that
often are the least likely to weather tough times -- such as
The Turkey Hunter, Victorian Decorating, and Nude &amp; Natural
(for nudists, naturally).
   In any case, Mr. Husni's numbers don't show how the ad
downswing is curtailing start-up activity by major
publishers. Business Week is going ahead with its launch of
Assets magazine, but Goldhirsh Group's Inc. magazine has
already folded its spinoff, The Inc. Life, after only one
issue in May. The Inc. Life was a quarterly lifestyle
magazine for the business executive.
   Some publishers are holding out hope that new car
introductions will pump auto dollars into major magazines.
This fall, General Motors Corp. is expected to launch a media
blitz to sell cars coming off the assembly line of its new
Saturn subsidiary.
   "Saturn is going to spend a fair amount in Newsweek," says
Peter Eldredge, publisher of Newsweek. "We've been told to
feel good about Saturn. But in this sort of climate, we
aren't taking anything for granted."

   Pension Cash
   Fuels Growth
   Of New Funds

   NEW YORK -- Need cash? Call a pension fund.
   While government officials fret about the threat of a
credit crunch, cash-flush pension funds are pumping billions
of dollars into a myriad of new investment pools. Their
goals: big returns from investing in everything from
salvaging companies overloaded with debt and buying bankrupt
securities (two of the most popular strategies) to investing
in European real estate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The source of funds for deals used to be insurance
companies and banks," says Charles H. Salisbury Jr., a
marketing executive for money manager T. Rowe Price
Associates, Baltimore. "Now the only ones with excess capital
are pension funds."
   So, at a time when Wall Street is shrinking many of its
operations, organizers of some limited partnership funds for
socalled alternative investments are scoring impressive
successes. E.M. Warburg Pincus &amp; Co. recently completed
raising a $1.8 billion pool to finance corporate turnarounds
and other investments, with much of the money coming from
pension funds, including $100 million from the giant
California Public Employees Retirement System.
   Last week, a partnership organized by Chicago investors
Sam Zell and David Schulte succeeded in raising $1 billion
from big investors to rescue troubled companies. That
included $30 million from the Minnesota state public employee
pension fund and $10 million from AMR Investment Services,
which runs the American Airlines pension fund. Mr. Schulte
says that 50% of the money for the new partnership was raised
from corporate pension funds and another 24% from
public-employee pension funds.
   Even excluding the new Zell-Chilmark fund, $2 billion has
been raised by various turnaround and bankruptcy-investing
partnerships, according to Tremont Partners Inc., New Caanan,
Conn., consultants. Tremont has compiled a directory of 50
bankruptcy funds, including 10 that have begun shopping for
money since April. "I find that remarkable," says Mary Ann
Johnson, Tremont's president.
   Despite the success of some fund-raisers, it is clearly a
buyer's market. The cash hoards of the big pension funds
allow them to be picky about the partnerships they will back
with investments, and to demand better financial terms from
sponsors.
   National Investment Management Inc., a California
investment firm with five funds under its belt, started to
raise money for a new small-company leveraged buy-out fund in
January and February by sending out 500 proposal books to
foundations, endowments, pension funds, insurers and banks.
During the next three months, it followed up with telephone
calls to each prospect. "Forty said come see us, and from
that maybe 20 will invest," said National partner Kenneth
Finn, adding: "We'd be thrilled with $50 million."
   With many highly leveraged companies in trouble, sponsors
are discovering that money for new LBO funds is especially
hard to find. "Anybody who is raising an LBO fund will tell
you it is tough going," says Richard Schmeelk, a former
Salomon Brothers banker who has worked in Canada, and now is
pushing a new fund for CAI Advisors &amp; Co. to specialize in
buy-outs of Canadian companies.
   Targeting geographic or industry niches is becoming a
standard marketing tactic for today's LBO fund-raisers.
Conseco Capital Partners purchases only insurance companies,
for example, and Kansas City-based Reimer &amp; Koger Associates
Inc. is starting to market a fund to buy Oklahoma companies.
(It will have the backing of the state government, which will
guarantee investors against the loss of half the money they
put into the fund.)
   Pension-fund managers are jumping at many of the other
investment pitches, however. With assets totaling more than
$2.5 trillion, pension funds are brimming with cash looking
for a home. Previously, they have been big backers of
alternative investments, such as venture capital, oil and gas
partnerships and, in their heyday, LBO funds.
   Investments off the beaten path promise diversity and
higher returns than their portfolios of stocks and bonds, the
managers believe. Further, pension funds, especially those
for state and local government employees, expect to be around
forever; that allows them to tie up chunks of their assets
for years, as is often required with alternative investments.
   "There is just an enormous amount of money available for
enhanced-return investment products," says Jerome P. Greene
of Benedetto, Gartland &amp; Greene Inc., which sells privately
placed securities to pension funds and other big investors.
   Just how much money pension funds will pour into the
latest alternative investment pools isn't clear. But even a
small percentage of pension assets means billions of dollars
flowing away from public stock and bond markets and into the
unseen world of private investments.
   The California Public Employees Retirement System, for
example, recently earmarked 2% of the fund for alternative
investments, which investment chief DeWitt Bowman says will
provide a "toe-in-the-water" baptism in the private market
area. It's a big toe, as the allocation will amount to more
than $1 billion for the $58 billion California fund.
   Thomas E. Flanigan, chief investment officer of the $30
billion California State Teachers Retirement System, expects
pension funds eventually to shift 20% to 25% of their assets
to alternative fields, which he defines as anything outside
publicly traded stocks and bonds and U.S. real estate.
   Mr. Flanigan says that pension funds like his, which is
growing by $4 billion a year, are becoming the primary source
of investment funds in the U.S. "We are going to be aligning
ourselves with multinational corporations and going into
partnerships on an international basis," he predicts.
   Making such deals routine will take years, however. In the
meantime, "No one has a concept that is big enough to absorb
the capital that first went into venture funds and then
leveraged buy-out funds," says Steven P. Galante, managing
director of Venture Economics Inc., which tracks the venture
and buy-out activity.
   Nevertheless, some industry experts worry that pension
officials are getting caught up in investment fads that could
prove dangerous. "All these limited partnerships that have
been offered to the pension funds are on the high-risk side,"
says Ronald D. Peyton, president of pension consultants
Callan Associates Inc.
   But big investors are improving the odds by using their
clout to squeeze more generous terms out of partnership
organizers. For example, the standard management fee for
partnership organizers, formerly 2% of the assets under
management each year, is now more often 1 1/2% or less in new
funds.
   "A few years ago we would have made it 2%, but we wanted
to remove as many of the barriers as we could" to attract
investors, says Thomas Hicks, a Dallas-based investment
banker who has raised $160 million for a new LBO fund and
hopes to reach $250 million by the fall.
   Organizers in the past also routinely kept 20% of their
partnerships' profits; now investors are demanding that they
first receive a return of about 10% on their investments
before divvying up the rest with the organizer. And that
once-sacred 20% share for the organizer is under pressure,
shrinking to 15% in some cases.
   Still another wrinkle is that partnership organizers are
giving investors more leeway to later opt out of deals they
might object to on various grounds.

   First-Time Incentives Set
   For 1991 Escort, Tracer;
   New Project in Hungary

   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co., in an effort to jump-start
"disappointing" car sales, is telling dealers it will boost
spending for marketing its highest-volume cars -- including
slapping first-time incentives on the new 1991 Ford Escort
and Mercury Tracer subcompacts.
   Separately, Ford said yesterday it will invest $80 million
to construct and equip a state-of-the-art plant in Hungary to
manufacture automotive ignition coils and fuel pumps. This is
Ford's first move into Eastern Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The No. 2 auto maker's new effort to boost U.S. car sales
is outlined in a July 9 letter to dealers signed by Ford
division general manager Thomas J. Wagner. Excerpts of the
letter were published yesterday in the trade journal
Automotive News.
   In his letter, Mr. Wagner said the Ford division's
first-half sales performance is "disappointing to us all."
The division wanted 16% of the car market, but managed to get
only a 15% share during the first half, he wrote.
   The Ford division is the larger of Ford's two
car-marketing operations; the other is the Lincoln-Mercury
division.
   Worse yet, from Ford's point of view, sales of Ford-badged
cars trailed those of archrival Chevrolet by about 45,000
units as of the end of June.
   A key problem, Mr. Wagner conceded, is the weak start for
the 1991 Escort, which Ford designed with the help of Mazda
Motor Co. and launched with considerable fanfare this spring.
   Production problems on the new model and high supplies of
the old, less expensive version of the subcompact have
depressed sales of the 1991 model, Mr. Wagner acknowledged.
So now, Ford is scrapping its effort to sell the new Escort
without discounts. Through Aug. 8, it is offering $500 cash
rebates on all 1991 Escorts to first-time Ford buyers who
finance through the auto maker's financing subsidiary.
   In addition, Ford is offering dealers between $200 to $500
for every new Escort they sell, and is increasing by 50%, or
$11 million, its contribution to a fund that pays for certain
dealer advertising. That money is to be used during July and
August to increase advertising exposure for the Escort and
other Ford cars.
   A Ford spokesman declined to elaborate on the letter.
   But some Ford dealers say they're not sure if the new
package of incentives and additional marketing money will be
enough to boost sales of the new Escort and Tracer.
   "To clear inventories, they really need to do something,"
said James Hoffer, general manager of Jordan Ford, a
high-volume dealership in Mishawaka, Ind. He expressed doubt
that the program outlined in Mr. Wagner's letter will produce
a sharp jump in sales.
   But Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity Ford in Ann Arbor,
Mich., said the goal of recapturing lost market share is
"realistic." However, he said, "we lost a lot of traction in
the Escort part of the market."
   A big problem, dealers said, was delays in rolling out the
Escort GT model, which comes with a more powerful standard
engine, and the station wagon version of the car. Mr. Wagner
said the production snags holding up delivery of those models
should be resolved by August.
   Meanwhile, Ford said it plans to build a 170,000
square-foot manufacturing facility in Hungary to produce as
many as 3.2 million ignition coils and fuel pumps for export
to Ford assembly factories in Germany, England, Spain,
Belgium and Portugal. Operations are scheduled to begin in
1992. Ford said it has Hungarian government approval to build
the plant on its own.
   Ford is moving more cautiously than some of its rivals,
notably General Motors Corp., to push into newly opened
Eastern European markets. GM announced in January it plans to
form a $150 million joint venture with Raba, the state-owned
Hungarian company, to build both cars and engines. The No. 1
auto maker also has announced joint ventures in East Germany
and Russia.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Ford shares closed at $43.625, down 62.5 cents.

   MILAN -- Italy's gross domestic product in the first
quarter rose a seasonally adjusted 0.9% from the 1989 fourth
quarter and was up 3.1% from a year earlier, Istat, the
national statistics agency, said.
   The first-quarter growth rates compare with a quarterly
increase of 0.5% and a year-to-year increase of 2.8% in the
1989 fourth quarter.

   The Dirt on Fertilizer, an Aggie Says,
   Is So Much...Manure

   NORTHBROOK, Ill. -- Billie B. Turner apologizes that "it's
kind of hard to make fertilizer sound like a sexy product"
and then proceeds to entertain you.
   It's been 36 years since the Texas A&amp;M graduate joined
International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp. but there's a lot of
Aggie left in him. And as the head of IMC Fertilizer Group
Inc. since it was spun off from the parent in 1988, he needs
all the homely humor he can muster. Not only have the
company's sales been slow lately, but his industry is being
pressed on the pollution and nutrition fronts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We've got the cheapest, most palatable, healthiest food
in the world in this country . . . and there are a lot of
people that want to fix that," he warms up. Although the Alar
chemical scare with apples was in somebody else's orchard --
IMC is the largest private miner of phosphate and potash, the
second and third most common soil additives, but doesn't
produce pesticides or other plant sprays -- he spits out
Meryl Streep's name as if the crusading actress were a wad of
bad chaw.
   A risk standard of "zero tolerance" is no way to live, he
says. "I don't know what zero is. I'm an old fuddy, but when
I went to college, we thought it was fantastic to be able to
test for parts per million. This was a big goddam deal] Now
they're talking about parts per quadrillion. That's one drop
of water on a damn golf course. It's about one small finger
of a Chinaman in China. I can't comprehend such things. If a
hundred-mile-an-hour wind hits Chicago and kills a hundred
people, they're saying a 10-mile-an-hour breeze comes
through, 10 people will die."
   Fertilizers haven't gotten quite the adverse attention
that pesticides have, but the issues are similar and Mr.
Turner is raising IMC's profile to fight back. He
acknowledges that abusive or sloppy use of fertilizers does
occur, leading to potential harm through runoff and
groundwater contamination, but says "economics dictates" that
the malpractice is limited to marginal cases, 1% or 2%. Most
growers "are not going to be putting expensive stuff on a
farm if you don't have to have it. There are a few dummies
out there, but most of them went broke."
   Usually the incentive for proper soil management is
personal, he argues. "Family farmers . . . are going to be
handing down to future generations. They're not going to foul
the drinking water on that farm. That's going to be the first
water to be fouled if they're going to foul it."
   But aren't those folks a dying breed? "Nearly all the
farmers in the United States are family farmers," Mr. Turner
says. "A high percentage of `corporate farmers' are there by
legal status to protect {the estate} when the patriarch dies.
And a lot of people are listed by the government as farmers
who are not farmers. I don't think we've called on a major
corporation in the United States in years to try to sell them
fertilizer."
   Asked what accounts for the current unease over his
products if it's so groundless, Mr. Turner points to the
organic-farming lobby. "They were trying to get legislative
definitions and restrictions that would protect the almost
incredible increase in price that they need for their
product," he says, putting that markup at 25% to 40%. Others
have joined the drive for their own political ends.
   "Organics want to take us back to Jeffersonian days.
Sounds kind of lovely, the clip-clop of horses and all. But
our problem in this country is not getting people back to the
farm, it's trying like hell to keep the ones who are there. .
. . We don't have a quarrel with the organic farmer. But it's
not for everyone. The winegrower in Napa looks at things
differently from the cotton farmer in {west} Texas. If you're
at Broken Elbow, N.D., the winters are going to freeze out a
lot of your insects. In the South, they're going to live
pretty much all year long. So this guy says `I encouraged a
few ladybugs' -- I'm all for that. But I do have concern over
anybody that gets carried away and says we're going to get
the farm bill changed and you're going to farm our way or
you're not going to farm."
   In addition to phosphate and potash, IMC also produces
nitrogen-based compounds, by far the most prevalent
fertilizer source. Mr. Turner chides those who "say natural
nitrate is great, and then they call ours synthetic. It's
made of very natural products, but synthetic is bad." He says
the environment can't tell the difference.
   Overuse of any substance can hurt. Holland, he notes,
spreads an "incredible" amount of animal waste over farmlands
and nitrate levels are high. Indeed, fertilizer (and
pesticide) usage abroad is much higher than in North America.
Economics columnist Warren Brookes recently reported that
France adds more than four times as much to each acre of soil
as the U.S., West Germany more than six times and Japan more
than nine times.
   "They are producing all out," Mr Turner says. "A number of
those countries have worshipped at maximum production. This
company is looking at maximum economic production."
   Although some U.S. producers complain they're at a
disadvantage in international competition because of
environmental regulation here, Mr. Turner doesn't want to try
to put all nations on the same footing, as has been tried
with chlorofluorocarbons and soon possibly with carbon gases.
   "You can make that argument but I think the prevailing
argument has to be that the Indians know best what's good for
the Indians," he says. "I suspect I know just exactly what we
would do: We'd stick a stake in the ground and say, by God if
you don't do it our way, we'll cut the trade off, you won't
have access to the World Bank."
   IMC has an interest here, because less-developed nations
such as Brazil, China and India are its growth markets. But
Mr. Turner sounds philosophical. "By and large, it seems to
me that decisions made further down are better than those
made higher up. Take reclamation. More people will put up
with {soil and water conservation requirements} if decisions
are at the state level."
   Farming is an example of government "industrial policy" in
action, and with all the direct and indirect subsidies it can
be hard sorting out competing claims. You start by
recognizing trade-offs in use of natural resources. Unless
their agenda includes reducing society's output,
environmentalists can see this in terms of minimizing the
uneconomic import of water into naturally dry areas. One way
to maintain economically justifiable agriculture production
with less water is by use of more fertilizer.
   Mr. Turner claims simply to want rationality. What is the
prospect? "It'll probably get worse before it gets better.
But I've got a lot of faith in this country and its system.
We tend to be pretty lethargic until we finally get around to
reacting to anything, be it segregration, quality of
education, road infrastructure. And then we kind of wake up
and we overreact. But time goes along and we find a
reasonable approach. And I think that'll happen here."

   Dow Sprints to High,
   Just Shy of 3000 Close

   NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average sprinted to
its third consecutive record, but fell short of closing at
3000 by just a quarter of a point.
   Much of the market's stride came from reports of strong
second-quarter earnings at some companies. International
Business Machines jumped 1 3/8 to 122 3/8 after announcing a
quarterly profit that was at the high end of analysts'
estimates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Late profit-taking kept the industrial average below the
3000 benchmark, finishing at 2999.75, up 19.55. Trading
activity was a moderate 149.4 million shares in New York
Stock Exchange trading -- considerably slower than the 200
million-plus share turnovers on Thursday and Friday last
week.
   Stocks dominated the action in financial markets. Bond
prices closed essentially unchanged. The dollar ended mixed.
   Stock prices rose in early trading partly on IBM's
earnings news and similar good tidings from NCR. "Stocks have
some forward momentum, with the worst earnings news behind us
and earnings generally not declining as much as expected,"
said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Minneapolis-based
Norwest Corp. He also thinks investors are expecting further
declines in interest rates, which should help boost corporate
profits.
   Other analysts are harder put to explain why the
industrial average has leaped 108.91 points over the past
four sessions.
   Steven Einhorn, portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs,
said investors are so busy buying stocks they are overlooking
fundamental concerns that normally would slow the market's
gains.
   "We are in an overvalued market that looks like it wants
to get more overvalued, independent of bonds, independent of
earnings, independent of the dollar," he said. "Investors
appear to want to own only one asset. That's the default
reason for it going up, but that isn't the kind of market
that will play to the strengths of a fundamentalist. The
market has been irrepressible."
   Stock investors have had all the right reasons one could
want to sell, Mr. Einhorn said: a Fed easing on interest
rates that was slow in coming and modest, a
weaker-than-expected dollar, some earnings disappointments
and a yearlong decline in the margin of rising stocks over
falling stocks.
   But a rising market makes people who have a lot of cash
nervous, Mr. Einhorn said. "They don't want to miss something
that could be powerful and extended, whether they're
fundamentally bullish or not." While the 3000 mark itself has
no magical significance, "it can add impetus psychologically
as we get close to it" for those portfolio managers feeling
pressure to jump on the bandwagon, he said.
   Frank A. Cappiello Jr., president of San Francisco-based
McCullough, Andrews &amp; Cappiello, a money manager, agreed that
stocks are the place to be for investors. "The only game in
town now in total return is stocks," he said. "Gold is bad
news. Real estate is more big chasms and bottomless pits to
come. Bonds have been more volatile than stocks over the past
two years, and I think people have been intuitively aware of
it."
   Mr. Cappiello said there is ample reason to believe the
market has room to climb further. He cited continued positive
earnings news and the belief that interest rates are going to
come down further before they go up.
   Bond traders didn't act like they saw lower rates coming.
Bond prices closed unchanged, with investors having digested
Friday's drop in interest rates and awaiting pivotal economic
news later this week.
   The dollar was stronger than expected but ended mixed;
traders are awaiting Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's semiannual
economic and monetary review tomorrow for signs that fighting
inflation remains the Fed's top priority.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners,
868 to 678.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood to 8.45%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6547 marks, compared with 1.6510
marks Friday, and unchanged at 148.15 yen.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   One Lawyer's Deeds Tax State Legal Fund

   The fraudulent dealings of one New York attorney are
costing members of the state bar millions of dollars in
restitution funds for dozens of bilked clients.
   Last week the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection, in
Albany, awarded $2.3 million to 61 former clients of Jack B.
Solerwitz, a former Long Island attorney now in prison for
grand larceny. There are 50 more claims pending, with losses
of more than $2 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If not the largest case of client theft, it is certainly
close to the largest in the state's history," says Martin
Minkowitz, a partner at Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan and
chairman of the state bar's Committee on Professional
Discipline.
   Since March 1988, 149 former clients across the country
have claimed huge losses resulting from their dealings with
the 33-year old Mr. Solerwitz, who was disbarred in February
and who listed $4 million in debts on his personal-bankruptcy
filing in Nassau County (N.Y.) Court.
   The Lawyers' Fund is an agency created by the state
finance law in 1981 to pay full or partial restitution to
victims of dishonest lawyers. There is a $100,000 limit for
each individual claim. The source of the agency's funds is
the membership of the New York bar -- about 90,000 practicing
lawyers.
   Until this year, New York lawyers were required to pay a
$100 registration fee to the state every two years. Of that,
$50 went to the Lawyers' Fund. As of June 1990, the biannual
fee requirement has tripled. Of the $300 payment, $60 will go
to the client-security fund. And for at least the next year
most of the $60 will go to the victims of Mr. Solerwitz.
   "There are those who now call the registration fee the
`Solerwitz Memorial Surcharge,'" says Grace Moran, deputy
counsel for the state's grievance committee for Nassau and
Suffolk counties on Long Island, who handled the part of the
case against Mr. Solerwitz involving his right to practice
law in the state.
   In April, Mr. Solerwitz, who was once renowned for
representing 800 disenfranchised air traffic controllers in
the aftermath of the 1981 strike, pleaded guilty to grand
larceny in Nassau County Court. He admitted taking $1.8
million from escrow and other accounts of many clients. He
was recently sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 15 years.
   Mr. Solerwitz, who practiced in Mineola, Long Island,
handled employment discrimination cases, divorces, and real
estate transactions. According to information in his victims'
claims, he bamboozled his clients in three ways, says Ms.
Moran, the lawyer at the grievance committee.
   He would take fees without doing the requisite work, she
says. He would take down payments for houses, divorce
settlements and personal injury proceeds, place them in
escrow and use the money for his own purposes, she says. And
he would persuade people to lend him large sums of money.
"You would be amazed at how many people remortgaged their
homes to lend him money," says Ms. Moran.
   "To this day, we are still getting complaints," she says.
"This morning, one called claiming $9,000 in losses. It was a
$9,000 personal injury settlement in which he had written a
bad check. I don't know when it will end."

   JUSTICE DEPARTMENT admits it defamed former official.
   In an unusual admission of error, the Justice Department
conceded that it had mistakenly accused Roger Pilon, a former
department official, of disclosing classified information to
a foreign government and then resigning from his post in the
face of removal proceedings.
   The department made the admission, together with a formal
apology and a settlement of $25,000, in documents signed on
Thursday. But department officials didn't announce the action
publicly. Mr. Pilon, now an officer of the Cato Institute, a
Washington research group, disclosed the documents yesterday.
   In a letter to Mr. Pilon's lawyer, Assistant Attorney
General Stuart Gerson acknowledged that a report widely
distributed last November by the department's Office of
Professional Responsibility "incorrectly stated" that a
counter-intelligence investigation into allegations that Mr.
Pilon had provided the South African government with
classified documents "discovered that sufficient cause
existed to terminate (Mr. Pilon's) political appointment."
The report also mistakenly stated that Mr. Pilon resigned
from his job as director of the department's office of asylum
policy "prior to the initiation of removal proceedings."
   In fact, Mr. Gerson continued, the 1988 investigation
exonerated Mr. Pilon. After having been put on administrative
leave of absence, Mr. Pilon resumed his post and his "top
secret" security clearance was returned. Moreover, his
subsequent resignation "was not made in the face of removal
proceedings," Mr. Gerson wrote.
   A department spokesman declined to answer questions as to
whether anyone in the Office of Professional Responsibility
would be disciplined for issuing the incorrect report.
   Mr. Pilon called the incident a "Kafkaesque nightmare . .
. because we never knew where the accusations came from." His
wife, Juliana, also was investigated for allegedly disclosing
classified information, but she was never charged.
   Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif.), one of several lawmakers
who had pressured Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to
publicly exonerate Mr. Pilon, praised the admission, but he
added, "This apology is long overdue."

   "For us to lose the Ukraine would be the same as losing

   LVOV, U.S.S.R. -- It is a sunny afternoon, and perfect
weather for tweaking the Communist Party's nose. Actually,
any weather is perfect for that in the Ukraine these days.
   In Lvov, the heart of the Ukraine's unruly west, the
tweaking gets particularly cheeky. On this day, for example,
factory workers dressed as Cossacks appear at a monument to a
Ukrainian freedom fighter beheaded in the 16th century. They
wheel up a homemade cannon and stuff shreds of Pravda, the
Communist Party newspaper, down its barrel. A bit of
gunpowder, a match and then a dog-scattering "kaBOOOOM]" In
the smoke, standing at stiff attention, 10 workers are
dressed in uniforms of a 1919 Ukrainian independence army --
a traitorous army, in Moscow's view.
   "We could have never gotten away with this a year ago --
we'd be in jail," a worker says proudly.
   Indeed, Ukrainians are giddily getting away with acts of
defiance that Moscow only last year promised never to allow
in the Soviet Union's largest republic aside from the Russian
republic. It is an industrial and farming region of 52
million people crucial to Soviet existence.
   Yesterday, the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev, voting 355 to
4, declared its sovereignty. The parliament asserted that
Ukrainian laws now take precedence over Soviet laws, and
announced that the republic planned to raise its own army and
issue its own money. The parliament stopped short of total
separation from the Soviet Union.
   The Ukraine move follows similar declarations in the
Russian Federation, Moldavia and Uzbekistan, and declarations
of outright independence by the Baltic states of Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia. The Kiev vote, in a Parliament previously
dominated by pro-Moscow conservatives, demonstrates the
rapidly growing power of Ukrainian independence forces that
only began openly organizing last fall.
   Nowhere in the Ukraine are those forces as vociferous as
here in Lvov, a Communist hard-liner's nightmare of runaway
"perestroika" and crumbling party authority and prestige.
This lovely old city of cobblestone streets and centuries-old
houses and churches, Communists say, is a nest of anti-Soviet
and anti-party extremists. And they are correct.
   Liberal reformers say Lvov is their nightmare, too, with
party apparatchiks stubbornly resisting change in defiance of
both local sentiment and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
who last week charged that local party obstructionists were
playing into the hands of breakaway forces.
   He couldn't have been more right in Lvov's case. Here, a
democratic bloc won big majorities March 4 in city and
"oblast," or regional, councils, the top governing bodies
below the Parliament. But after 51 years of running
everything here, the Communists aren't about to let simple
voter sentiment push them around. They're sitting tight, more
or less in control of the police, militia, KGB, media,
factories, collective farms and transport. The democrats are
chipping away, often with more pluck than muscle.
   Lvov is a garden of grass-roots "glasnost." At a local
Hyde Park on the promenade in front of the Opera House,
newlyweds stop by to receive pre-honeymoon blessings from
elders in the Ukrainian independence movement. At the
movement's new office across from the Lenin Monument,
volunteers sort donated relief supplies destined for
Lithuania. At the new dissidents' kiosk, next to the
baked-goods kiosk, customers line up to buy movement flags,
buttons and dissident journals from across the Soviet Union.
   At last year's May Day parade, the ruling Communists
ordered police to shoo away pro-democracy marchers, with
their blue and yellow flags. This year, the new ruling
democrats wouldn't allow Communists into the parade. When
they complained of discrimination, the Communists were told
they had forgotten to apply for a parade permit.
   The democrats wanted live television coverage of the new
oblast council's first session, beginning April 9. The
Communists, still in control of the local TV station, said
no, pleading poverty. Within a week, the council got more
than 2.5 million rubles in donations from citizens demanding
live coverage. The station now covers the sessions
gavel-to-gavel.
   When a Red Army colonel-general arrived from Moscow last
month to announce the installation of a satellite tracking
station at a nearby base, the council said: Not so fast.
Where's your environmental-impact statement?
   The newly elected democrats lofted their blue and yellow
flags atop City Hall and the Oblast Building, symbolically
claiming the buildings and the government. Fine, said the
Communists, but we still control the office space inside.
   Vyacheslav Chernovil, a former dissident journalist
released from a labor camp only three years ago, now governs
Lvov Oblast, a Massachusetts-size region of 2.7 million
people, as chairman of the council. His deputy is Ivan Hel, a
religious leader imprisoned for 18 years, "not counting the
15 days I got last year for organizing a demonstration," he
says. "Now here I am. God does work in mysterious ways."
   Messrs. Chernovil and Hel and others met clandestinely
here on May 7, 1989, to form the Lvov chapter of the Popular
Movement in Support of Perestroika, or "Rukh," the Ukrainian
word for "Movement." While officially apolitical, it quickly
became an umbrella group for both pro-democracy and
pro-Ukrainian independence forces.
   They never could have won, Mr. Chernovil says, without the
Communist-controlled militia and police, who violently broke
up their demonstrations last year, thereby swelling the ranks
of Rukh. The democrats and nationalists won 170 of the 196
seats in the council. Communist Party members won 26 seats,
but 11 of them defected to the democrats on live TV,
diminishing Communist loyalists to an 8% minority.
   "They are three army officers, five factory directors,
three collective-farm chairman and four others," Dmitri Kos,
a democratic councilman, says of the Communists. "Their
voices aren't audible."
   In fact, in front of the TV cameras, they sat stone-faced
as the council doubled the size of private farm plots,
created Lvov time -- an hour earlier than Moscow time -- and
decreed that government officials, including judges, give up
membership in political parties while in office.
   The council is feeling its way. It spent a recent day
debating an "oppressed people" bill, which would restore
privileges to former political prisoners and others wronged
by the party over the decades.
   The oblast prosecutor, a party man, is summoned before the
TV cameras to explain how this is to be done. It won't be
easy, he says. The injured parties must be officially
rehabilitated under laws handed down from Kiev, Ukraine's
capital, and Moscow. That means the tens of thousands of
cases in his files have to be handled one by one, and he has
money for only 12 staffers to do the work. And the law on who
was a freedom fighter and who was a subversive is very fuzzy.
It will take years and years.
   "Legal gobbledygook," shouts a councilman. In the
meantime, he says, oppressed people should have the same
privileges as veterans, including the right to shop in
specially stocked veterans' stores.
   "Wait a minute," another councilman says. "You want the
repressors and the repressed in the same shops? That would be
pretty uncomfortable. I say give the repressed their own
shops."
   Chairman Chernovil interrupts. There's no money for
special shops, he says.
   At the moment, the formerly repressed would settle for a
little more office space in the Oblast Building, where the
new council's leaders and staff are wedged into offices on
the second floor swarming with giddy citizens never before
allowed on the premises. Now, uniformed guards shoo away
unexpected visitors from the Communist stronghold on the
third and fourth floors.
   "We don't have to give them anything," says Communist
Party First Secretary Vyacheslav Vasilyevitch Secretaryuk,
after welcoming the "comrades of the Western press" into his
spacious office for an interview. Secretary Secretaryuk is a
52-year-old party veteran who got the top job in April, after
his predecessor's humiliating election loss.
   "We have a perfectly legal five-year lease on this office
space," he explains, not mentioning that the party signed the
lease with itself. He does explain, however, that the party
is brimming with good will and generosity, in sharp contrast
to the riffraff below.
   "We want to cooperate," he says. "We offered them 17
offices on the fourth floor. They refused. They say they want
the third floor. They say they'll demonstrate if we don't
give in. I say fine, but please don't do it during working
hours. Productivity is low enough. They say if they don't get
their way, they'll strike. But they're the government now]
Who do they think they're striking against?"
   Secretary Secretaryuk notes that he stands shoulder to
shoulder with George Bush, Margaret Thatcher and other
Western leaders in believing that a fragmented Soviet Union
would be dangerously destabilizing for Europe and the world.
He is trying to do his little bit for stability, he says.
   "We're in crisis, so we must all work together for peace,"
he says. "But how can we work with these Rukh people when
they tell us that we are their political enemies?" At the
moment, the local Communist Party is battling enemies within.
Commanders at one of the city's five police districts have
quietly told the council they will obey council instead of
party orders.
   Defectors have abounded at the TV station ever since Oct.
1, when ace reporter Boris Kozlovsky came back with great
videotape of pro-democracy demonstrators being beaten by
police and his party bosses refused to put it on the air.
   "I couldn't stand it anymore," he says. "I became an
activist." He and other workers at the station began sneaking
clips of pro-democracy doings onto the air. "It was easy," he
says. "The bosses are lazy, they hardly ever watch. Once
people saw these things, pressure built to show more." Mr.
Kozlovsky still reports the news. He also makes it. He won a
seat on the council, where one of his first acts was to
resign from the party -- on live TV.
   "A lot of people aren't turning in their party cards who
want to," he says. "They think there might be a military coup
or something. And if that happens, of course, people who quit
the party will probably be the first to be shot. But I've
already lived 50 years. That's a lot."
   The Communist Party still publishes all the
non-underground newspapers sold in Lvov. But out at the
newsrooms and joint printing plant on the southern edge of
town, the party is losing its grip.
   On one floor, Lvov Pravda's editors and reporters are
trying to wrest financial control from the party, which they
say makes big profits but pays tiny salaries. Two floors up,
the paper of the Communist Youth League is in open revolt. It
used to be named Leninist Youth. Two months ago, its staff
changed the name to Young Galician, a reference to this
region's historical name, Galicia. The paper's popularity
soared when it began covering speeches and rallies of
pro-democracy candidates this spring, against party orders.
   "The first secretary in Kiev called us anti-Communist and
threatened to shut us down," a reporter says. "But this paper
has too much influence and too many readers for them to stop
us. It's just pressure tactics."
   Does this mean that the Communist Party can't even close
down one of its own newspapers, he is asked.
   "Look, the party doesn't even control the party," he says.
"The party isn't behind the wheel anymore." As he talks,
Stepan Kurpil, a party secretary, looks on sheepishly.
   "People finally realized the world revolves around the sun
and not Moscow," says Andrei Pidlisny, a cartoonist. "The
Central Committee may own the building and the presses," he
says, "but the pressmen are on our side."
   The pressmen also side with the council democrats, who
asked the party to give one of its newspapers to the council.
"We said, `You take Pravda, we'll take Free Ukraine,'" says
Vasily Basiv, a new councilman and former Transcarpathian
correspondent for a party paper. Free Ukraine is another
party paper.
   When the party refused, the pressmen raised the
blue-and-yellow Rukh flag over the printing plant and
threatened to shutdown all the party's papers. The party
offered a deal: The council could start a new paper.
Subscribers to Free Ukraine would re-subscribe either to it
or to the council paper.
   "After a couple of days it dawned on them that this was,
in effect, a referendum on the party vs. the council, and
they were losing badly," says Mr. Basiv. "So they canceled
the deal."
   Instead, the council announced that it would publish its
own eight-page tabloid, "For a Free Ukraine," on the party's
presses. Its subscription goal of 100,000 was met in three
days. As its editor, Mr. Basiv is busy organizing a staff for
what he says is Ukraine's first real independent newspaper.
He is seeking a non-interference pledge from the council and
preparing for Communist intimidation.
   "If the party threatens us, I can pick up the phone to
Rukh and within two hours there will be 200,000 people out
there on the street," Mr. Basiv says. "They could try
blackmailing us by withholding newsprint. We have two outs.
Lvov has a cardboard factory that could make newsprint out of
recycled paper. Or we could try to get newsprint from Western
sources." That would take hard currency, which Mr. Basiv says
he is eager to earn by selling ads in the West.
   "We'll print anything," he says with a laugh. "Our
hard-currency bank account is empty, so our standards are
very flexible."
   It was a lot easier being a dissident than it is running a
government, says Vasil Shpitser, 43-year-old chairman of the
new Lvov City Council. His City Hall desk is stacked high
with petitions and complaint letters from many of the city's
860,000 citizens who believe they finally have a city
government that will produce -- water, say. It's been years
since municipal taps ran more than a few hours a day.
   All day long, aggrieved citizens traipse into his office
with their problems. "A lot of people come in here and just
cry," he says. "They have been chronically abused. For years
and years nobody would listen to them."
   The five most common problems, he says, are "apartments,
apartments, apartments, apartments and apartments." Many
families have waited for new housing for more than a decade
while those with party connections jumped the queue. Others
paid bribes and, he says, "We're going to the prosecutor with
several cases."
   Down one more level of government, Mikhail Boichishin,
41-year-old chairman of one of Lvov's five district councils,
is almost nostalgic for his dissident days -- which didn't
end until the March 4 elections. Back then, he says, he
smuggled truckloads of the movement's underground newspapers
in from Lithuania, where they were printed. He sold movement
buttons and flags. Police knocked him down at demonstrations.
   Now he marches up front in parades, an honored guest. Now
he gives visitors a tour of his district, wheeling his tired
blue Moskvich sedan the wrong way down a one-way street,
asking, "Can the president of the United States do this?"
   He seems to like the power, but feels powerless. He is now
in charge of giving out new apartments in his district. The
waiting list has more than 7,000 names on it, but he will get
only 120 or so apartments each year to hand out. So every day
he has to say no to constituents who file into his office
pleading for them.
   "He's into real life now and he can't do anything," his
wife, Lyubomira, says over lunch in the apartment they waited
15 years for.
   "We're naked kings," he says with a scowl.

   The Soviet Reality: Murder, Apathy, Dishonesty

   Moscow -- These are the things to say to make a Russian
happy: "Your country stinks." "Your leaders are criminals."
"I can't wait to get out of here."
   Russians have developed a passion for criticism. A visitor
here is constantly asked his impressions of the city. If he
tries to be polite, and balance the good with the bad, the
Russian listener pulls a sour face and looks away. But if the
question is met with a great gust of aspersion, then a broad
smile of satisfaction sweeps across the Moscovite's face,
before he concludes, "You've only seen the best of it."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In this general atmosphere of eager self-loathing, the
cultural event of the moment is a scathing documentary on
Soviet life called "One Shouldn't Live This Way," by
Stanislav Govorukhin. It surveys Soviet criminal activity --
from rapes and mutilations committed by homicidal maniacs; to
the Baku massacre, organized at the highest reaches of the
Soviet government. The film's message is that crime and
corruption are the bricks and mortar of Soviet society. The
Soviet people love it.
   A film such as this still gets censored unless it has
powerful friends. "One Shouldn't Live This Way" has been
championed by the reformist mayors of Moscow and Leningrad.
Though it can be seen nowhere else in the Soviet Union, they
have ordered it shown in their cities. A friend had to stand
in line for three hours to get tickets for a weekday,
midafternoon screening.
   The first few minutes are searing. Mr. Govorukhin's
cameras show fresh murder scenes, with bodies carved open,
with relatives in frenzies of grief. Police photos display
nude women who have been raped and mutilated. One convict is
brought back to the scene of his crime to re-enact how he
lured a young girl into the woods, and then knifed her to
death. He is meticulous and almost cheerful. "It was quite
normal," he says, showing the various positions of his victim
as he stabbed her.
   It's not clear how much of this Mr. Govorukhin intends to
blame on communism, perhaps nothing more than the way the
criminals are completely apathetic about their fate.
   Mr. Govorukhin is on firmer ground comparing Soviet police
forces with Western police forces. He visits the South Bronx
and Times Square, a wry joke since these are the places where
Soviet propaganda units have always done their American
filming. "There is crime in the United States," he assures a
chuckling audience. But the director is amazed at how well
equipped the New York cops are. He goes into detail over the
design of the American holster, which allows the officer to
draw his gun in one motion. The Soviet holster requires
several cumbersome maneuvers.
   Mr. Govorukhin marvels at how New York cops show up when
they are called to minor health emergencies. He shows how 10
or 15 police cars race to the scene of even a minor crime,
when a Times Square pimp tries to force a prostitute into his
car. The audience is more interested in the pimp's car, a
stretch limousine, than in his crime.
   Mr. Govorukhin films a police funeral in Queens, with
thousands of cops in attendance. He determines that the
officer's family gets $500,000 as compensation. He then shows
a grim Soviet police funeral; the dead officer's family gets
nothing.
   He interviews some American cops, and while the audience
giggles, they complain how bad things are. One cop remarks,
"What we really need are some Soviet cops to restore some
order here." The film cuts to a pathetic-looking Soviet
officer, with an ill-fitting uniform and poor equipment,
standing dazed in the middle of the street like a
brain-damaged sheep. The audience erupts into gales of
laughter.
   The final comparison is between the living conditions of a
high-ranking Soviet detective and a German patrolman from
Hamburg. The detective and his three children have one room
in a small apartment, which they share with other families.
They sleep side by side on the floor. The audience members
begin talking to each other as the film shows the German
patrolman leaving work in his Ford Taurus. By the time he is
sitting in his modern middle-class apartment, the dialogue is
drowned out by audience members commenting on the various
appliances and amenities.
   One of Mr. Govorukhin's points is that communism has
turned honest citizens into criminals, and he shows the
underhanded maneuvers that are required to get anything
accomplished in the Soviet Union. One of the current
expressions, not included in the movie, is: "If you are not
stealing from work, you are robbing your family."
   A line outside one liquor store in the movie stretches to
infinity. At another, order breaks down, and young men become
like savage beasts, looting and scrambling off with their
cache. The old are frequently trampled in these humiliating
rushes, Mr. Govorukhin reports.
   Two old ladies live somewhat remote from these events, in
the middle of the countryside. They subsist on home-grown
potatoes, and remember the pre-Gorbachev days when it was
possible to get sugar. Mr. Govorukhin cuts from them to what
may be the most luxurious store in the Soviet Union, the
duty-free shop at the Moscow airport. Prices are listed in
rubles, but Mr. Govorukhin still cannot buy anything. The
prices are in gold rubles, a currency Soviets cannot possess.
   Next he shows a well-dressed Russian woman trying to book
a room in some of the better but still awful Moscow hotels.
Not only is she as a Russian forbidden from staying in these
hotels, the clerks do not acknowledge her existence. She
politely asks for their attention, but they ignore her with
that form of sadistic callousness familiar to anyone who has
tried to shop in a Soviet store.
   The crimes get bigger. The cameras fly over a gulag. Mr.
Govorukhin travels to Baku, to see ethnic fighting. But the
massacres take place away from the ethnic strife and the
victims are mostly dissidents. "This is the greatest crime of
all," he says.
   The film ends with scenes of the fall of the Berlin Wall,
with giddy East Germans delirious to be liberated from
socialism. As the lights come up in the theater, my Russian
host is shaking, and tears of rage and frustration run down
her face. It takes her a few minutes to compose herself. But
she invites us to her apartment.
   Like many Soviet apartment buildings, the hallways are
crumbling and smell of urine. But inside the apartment, she,
her husband and her mother-in-law have built a lovely home.
Beautiful Russian religious icons, some from the 17th
century, hang on the walls. Dinner is a generous helping of
fruits, pastries and a homemade custard. There is no way to
get material for a main course. Afterward she modestly shows
us some of her astonishing drawings and sings Russian songs
in an unexpectedly pure and brilliant voice. She is only 20,
her husband somewhat older, but they are astoundingly
well-read and can quote long patches of poetry, like many
intelligent young Russians. They give us flowers to take
home, and the afternoon leaves us with the impression, so
common in the Soviet Union, that the country has the best
people on earth and the worst.

   The Senate takes up the farm bill this week, and one of
the first votes will be an attempt to put the bloated sugar
program on a diet. Senators Bill Bradley of New Jersey and
Bill Roth of Delaware think it's absurd that U.S. consumers
should pay twice the world price of sugar to support a few
wealthy domestic growers. Quotas on imported sugar cost
consumers $2.4 billion in higher food prices every year. They
also undercut U.S. foreign policy by undermining many
faltering Caribbean and Asian democracies that need currency
earnings to repay foreign debts and import U.S. products.
Senators Bradley and Roth propose a cut of about 10% in the
sugar subsidy. A budget squeeze already recently forced cuts
of about that size in subsidies for milk, wheat, cotton, rice
and feed grains. But the sugar lobby is powerful, and it has
discovered that large PAC contributions serve as a useful
sweetener. The vote on the sugar program will show whether
Congress has any interest in reforming America's Soviet-style
agricultural policy.

   Revco Examiner Appears to Find
   Some Basis for Suits by Creditors

   Creditors of Revco D.S. Inc. may have grounds to sue
former shareholders and others responsible for Revco's failed
$1.25 billion leveraged buy-out, according to a preliminary
report by a court-appointed special examiner.
   In the report filed late yesterday in federal court in
Akron, Ohio, Barry L. Zaretsky, the Revco examiner, said it
appears the management-led buy-out left the company with
insufficient working capital to continue as a going concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Therefore, Mr. Zaretsky wrote, creditors of the company,
now in bankruptcy court proceedings, have grounds to sue the
selling shareholders, investment bankers and others for
defrauding creditors through a so-called fraudulent
conveyance. But he recommended that any such suit be
postponed in hope that a voluntary reorganization plan can be
agreed on.
   Mr. Zaretsky preliminarily found that projections used to
support the buy-out group's analysis of the viability of the
deal may not have been properly prepared. And while Mr.
Zaretsky wrote that it was still too early to determine
whether Revco was essentially bankrupt immediately after the
buy-out, he said certain indications of insolvency were
present.
   A lawyer for Revco said he couldn't comment because he
hadn't yet read the report. Creditors' lawyers couldn't be
reached.
   Under fraudulent-conveyance law, creditors must prove that
the selling shareholders or others involved in the
transaction intended to defraud creditors or that the effect
of the deal was to leave the company insolvent, unable to pay
its debt or without enough capital to conduct its business.
In some states, a suit can be brought as many as six years
after the buy-out occurs. Under the law, anyone involved in
the fraudulent transfer can be held liable.
   Fraudulent conveyance laws can be used to attack
transactions of any size, but many bankruptcy lawyers have
argued that the law, which was first adopted by some states
in the U.S. in 1918 and is based on 16th-century English
common law, should not apply to modern business transactions
such as leveraged buy-outs. In a leveraged buy-out, the
purchase of the company is financed largely by debt that is
to be repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's
operations or the sale of its assets. Bankruptcy lawyers say
the law was never intended for such complex transactions.
   Mr. Zaretsky's findings may therefore be controversial.
"My research suggests that fraudulent conveyance applies to
leveraged buy-out deals, that highly aggressive
leveraged-buy-out deals may create significant fraudulent
conveyance risks," Mr. Zaretsky said.
   As a result, the report may play a role in how future LBOs
are structured. Particularly if the report triggers a
successful fraudulent conveyance suit in the Revco case,
financial institutions may decide to write down loans made to
companies that took on huge amounts of debt during Wall
Street's go-go 1980s.
   In many cases corporations financed their own buy-outs
with so-called junk or high-yield bonds. As the economy has
cooled, or the LBO company hasn't been able to generate
enough cash to meet interest payments and other obligations,
more and more have sought protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Such was the case in July 1988 when Revco, then a
2,000-store drugstore chain based in Twinsburg, Ohio, became
the largest junk bond-financed leveraged buy-out to file for
protection from creditors. Since then Revco hasn't been able
to put together a plan to re-emerge from bankruptcy that
suits its various debtholders and creditors.
   Nonetheless, the report recommends that no litigation be
commenced immediately, in hope of stimulating the parties to
reach agreement on a reorganization plan. If the debtors do
not reach such a plan by November, the report advocates
bringing litigation to avoid the risk of losing the right to
do so. According to the report, other actions under
consideration that would have to be brought by the end of
1990 include negligence, breach of duties owed to the debtors
and breach of contract. Mr. Zaretsky indicated in the report
that he is still investigating these issues but that his
preliminary analysis suggests that those actions alone could
return millions of dollars to the estates.
   In addition, the report determined that the buy-out itself
is not the only fraudulent conveyance action available. At
the time of the buy-out, nearly $80 million in fees was paid
to various professionals and the banks, and, the report
states, "these may have been grossly disproportionate to the
benefit, if any, received by the debtors." Mr. Zaretsky said
that among the professionals who may be liable are lawyers,
investment bankers, accountants and appraisers who worked on
the deal, but he said his investigation was not far enough
along to determine precisely who might be sued.
   The report said legal action could be filed against these
parties for recovery of the fees, whether or not the buy-out
is attacked. And Mr. Zaretsky wrote that he would consider
filing litigation concerning paydowns, extra interest and
security interests granted on the notes and debentures to
facilitate the buy-out even if a reorganization plan is
ultimately reached.
   Under fraudulent-conveyance law, former shareholders of
the company could be ordered to return the cash they received
for their shares. But Mr. Zaretsky indicated in the report
that he hoped to find a remedy that would not involve such
disgorgement.
   Because the fraudulent conveyance field is still
relatively new territory in terms of LBOs, Mr. Zaretsky said
he was still exploring possible remedies. But he said that he
hoped to develop theories that, in essence, would reorder the
priority of the estate's debts and make the estate solvent.
   Under these theories, unsecured general creditors would be
paid in full with interest, at the expense of parties who
contributed to the fraudulent conveyance.
   The report also indicated that liability may extend to
certain members of Revco's former senior management,
including Sidney Dworkin, Mark Dworkin and William Edwards,
who may have received payments disproportionate to their
stock when they left the company. The report estimated that
the estate could recover $8 million to $12 million if actions
against the men were pursued.
   "The report will fuel the flames and induce other
participants in LBOs to seek to reverse them," said Joel
Wolosky, a lawyer with the New York law firm of Parker Chapin
Flattau &amp; Klimpl, who represents a shareholder and two
directors of Wieboldt Stores Inc. in a fraudulent conveyance
suit involving the store's buy-out.
   Mr. Zaretsky, who is a Brooklyn Law School professor and
counsel at the New York law firm of Kelley Drye &amp; Warren,
said his report indicates that "in the long run, lenders to
highly aggressive LBO deals will be hurt."
   A lawyer for the banks said he could not comment on the
report because he hadn't yet read it. Lawyers for the trade
creditors and noteholders couldn't be reached for comment.

   CBOT Orders Unit
   Of Stotler Group
   To Boost Capital

   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade directed Stotler &amp;
Co., the futures brokerage unit of Stotler Group Inc., to
boost its capital by the close of business tomorrow or begin
liquidating customer accounts.
   Stotler, whose chairman, Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, is also
the chairman of the exchange, confirmed industry assertions
that it wasn't in compliance with Board of Trade capital
requirements.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stotler's capital problems are an acute embarrassment to
Mr. Mahlmann, whose administrative talents were touted in his
campaign for the exchange's top job, even though he hasn't
been involved in the company's day-to-day management for the
past few years.
   Low capital levels also may prompt a cash flow crisis for
Stotler &amp; Co., an old-line grain trading firm that has been
eclipsed in recent years by larger financial futures trading
rivals. It said it was transferring some customer accounts to
other brokers and was looking for additional capital to
remedy its problems. If a capital infusion isn't found,
"Stotler Group may be unable to meet its debt obligations
unless those obligations are refinanced or restructured,"
Stotler Group said.
   Stotler said that transferring customer accounts, and
thereby forgoing trading commissions generated by those
accounts, and other planned changes would reduce revenue and
net income for Stotler Group. For the first quarter, Stotler
Group reported net income of $370,000, or 17 cents a share,
and commission revenue of $28.4 million.
   Neither Stotler Group nor the exchange disclosed the
amount of capital Stotler has to support customer accounts.
   Stotler's capital problems may be tied to a dispute with
regulators over counting certain assets, specifically
commercial paper, as regulatory net capital, exchange members
said. Commodity regulations require that futures brokerage
firms maintain liquid assets in a separate account equal to a
certain percentage of funds in customer accounts.
   Restrictions are placed on a firm's activities when its
capital as defined by regulators falls to 7% of customer
funds. The firm can be immediately forced out of the customer
business if the capital level hits 4% of customer funds.
   Stotler Group had shareholders' equity of $8.5 million as
of March 31.
   Stotler Group's stock, which is listed on the American
Stock Exchange, didn't open for trading Thursday or Friday.
The trading halt prompted disclosures from exchange members
that the company hadn't maintained an adequate capital
cushion to support its customer business.
   The company's stock opened for trading late yesterday
morning on the Amex and closed at 5, down 2 7/8.
   Stotler Group said that one of its five subsidiaries, R.G.
Dickinson &amp; Co., a Des Moines, Iowa, securities broker, isn't
affected by the Board of Trade capital directive.

that taxpayers may use it to report pension or annuity
income, payments from an individual retirement account,
taxable Social Security benefits, estimated tax payments or
credit for elderly or disabled citizens. In the past,
taxpayers reporting these items were required to use the

   High Times Battles to Blunt Impact of DEA Scrutiny

   Many Advertisers Are Scared Away
   After Raids; Magazine Is Going `Green'

   NEW YORK -- One crisp morning last October, eight federal
agents burst through the front door of Martin Heydt's garden
supply shop, seizing cartons of records, client lists and two
computers.
   "It was bizarre," recalls Mr. Heydt, owner of Worm's Way
in Bloomington, Ind. "I guess because we advertise in High
Times, they thought we must be guilty of something."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, the Drug Enforcement Administration last year
searched several of High Times' advertisers, among other
concerns, during a nationwide raid called Operation Green
Merchant. And like Mr. Heydt -- who was never charged with
anything -- many dropped their ads in the magazine shortly
afterward. Since then, High Times says its ad revenue has
dropped by a third.
   For High Times, a $3.95-a-copy monthly magazine devoted to
marijuana smokers and growers, the raid was yet another salvo
in the government's war on drugs. In May, a federal
prosecutor in New Orleans subpoenaed the magazine and three
of its staff members to testify before a grand jury
investigating High Times for conspiracy to distribute drugs.
High Times "is against everything we stand for," says Steven
Cummings, deputy DEA chief of cannabis investigations.
   To many others, too, High Times is a blatant snub of the
"Just Say No" campaign. It features, for instance, centerfold
photos of primped marijuana buds, as if shot for the local
garden-club calendar.
   Today, jittery advertisers shunning the magazine still
fear another DEA raid. High Times says circulation has
dropped to 250,000 copies a month from a peak of 405,400 in
1976. Canada even banned the sale of High Times last year. If
not for "government harassment," groans High Times editor
Steven Hager, "we'd be hundreds of pages, thick with ads."
   But once again the magazine is fighting back. Once the
streetwise source of hard-drug articles and counterculture
news, High Times is going "green." It now advocates
environmentally sound uses of the hemp, or "Cannabis sativa",
plant, the source of marijuana buds. For instance, paper can
be made from the plant stalks and methanol oil can be
extracted from seeds to make "marijuana methane."
   Says a High Times subscription pamphlet: "The good news is
we've found a plant that can save the world. The bad news is
that it's illegal."
   A recent ad offers shirts and shorts made from hemp:
"Stoned Wear. A new line of hemp clothing and products from
Sativa Creations." The magazine is even delivered in black
"environmentally safe cornstarch bags" to ensure privacy.
   High Times has always printed studies and reports touting
what it contends is the relative safety of smoking marijuana.
It also likes to remind readers that American colonists,
including Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and George
Washington, devoted many acres to hemp grown for cloth, rope
and heating oil.
   The grand jury investigation is continuing, focusing on an
ad for a marijuana seed catalog by the Seed Bank in Amsterdam
that runs frequently in the magazine. The investigation into
Trans-High Corp., the magazine's parent company, is being
headed by U.S. Attorney John Volz.
   "It's as if there's not enough crime out there, so he {Mr.
Volz} is creating more," says Michael Kennedy, an attorney
for High Times since its start. "It's all designed to get him
headlines."
   Mr. Kennedy, who is also the attorney for Ivana Trump,
plans to raise First Amendment objections. "More important
than the fact they're actually trying to suppress information
is their attempt to chill the effort to publish," he says.
   Mr. Kennedy in June tried to quash the subpoenas on those
grounds, but his motion was denied by a federal judge.
   Many parents and drug-abuse groups would like to stifle
High Times. "To the average person . . . High Times is
shocking and unbelievable," says Billie Avery, executive
director of the National Federation of Parents for Drug Free
Youth. "It has no value for the American family."
   Potential readers are clearly there. In the past 10 years,
as the DEA has stepped up border patrols, domestic marijuana
growers have seen an opportunity. Last year, the DEA
eradicated 130 million plants vs. 39.2 million in 1985.
   With domestic policing of fields, indoor growing is also
on the rise. The magazine's house botanist, Ed Rosenthal,
answers readers' queries in the "Ask Ed" column. A recent
reader asks: "In a two-bedroom apartment, will six 1,000-watt
halides {grow lamps} draw so much power that it will be
suspicious?" The column gives monthly awards of "Bud of the
Month" or "Garden of the Month."
   But, says the DEA's Mr. Cummings, "There are U.S.
attorneys looking into the `Ask Ed' column, on possible
charges of aiding and assisting in the growth of an illegal
product."
   Other High Times features include High Witness News and
Trans-High Market Quotation, which gives readers, as well as
federal drug agents who subscribe, a quality index and street
price of marijuana throughout the country. For example, the
word on Houston Homegrown: "Takes four joints to get high;
not worth the money or the headache -- $20 {per} 1/4 oz."
   Tom Forcade, an underground journalist and member of Abbie
Hoffman's Youth International Party, started High Times in
the summer of 1974. Soon ad money rolled in and readership
surged.
   In 1978, Mr. Forcade committed suicide. Since then, the
magazine has watched profits ebb and flow. In the early
1980s, the magazine advocated the legalization of all drugs,
including cocaine and heroin, which caused much internal
debate over editorial mission.
   Today, it has dropped hard drugs in favor of focusing on
what is "accomplishable" with the marijuana plant. With a
staff of about a dozen, High Times now interviews the few
political advocates of legalization, such as Kentucky
gubernatorial candidate Gatewood Galbraith. Cartoons,
commentary and stories on local pot and hemp rallies fill the
pages, too.
   "We'll be watching," says the DEA's Mr. Cummings.

   Fed Plans Relaxed Limits on Securities,
   Business Activities of U.S. Banks Abroad

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Board issued proposals
to significantly relax limits on securities activities by
U.S. banks abroad and broaden the businesses the overseas
units can enter without specific approval from the central
bank.
   Under the package of proposals, overseas securities units
of U.S. banks would be allowed to underwrite as much as $60
million or 25% of the parent's so-called Tier 1 capital.
Currently, the limit is a flat $15 million. In the U.S, banks
are allowed to underwrite a limited amount of debt, and
although the Fed has indicated it will approve equities
underwriting, it hasn't yet approved an application by any
U.S. bank to do so.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tier 1 capital, considered the most important form of
capital, consists of common stock and other "tangible"
investments that provide a cushion for losses.
   The proposal would also raise the limit on the amount of
securities from a single issuer that an overseas bank unit
could hold in its trading account to $30 million or 10% of
Tier 1 capital, whichever is lower. The current limit is $15
million.
   The Fed also proposed that underwriting life insurance,
operating as a futures commission merchant and acting as a
principal or agent in interest-rate and foreign-currency swap
transactions be added to the list of approved activities for
the overseas units. The Fed has allowed banks' foreign
subsidiaries to engage in some of those activities on a
case-by-case basis, but the proposal would allow the units to
engage in the activities simply by notifying the Fed.
   The proposal, which is expected to be published in the
Federal Register soon and will be open for comment for 60
days, also would allow the foreign securities units to
underwrite 100% of an issuer's securities. Currently, the
bank units are allowed to underwrite only 20% of an issue.
The Fed said it was seeking comment on allowing banks to
exceed the underwriting limits if the parent company would
remain well-capitalized even after the excess underwriting
amount was deducted from its capital.
   Within 30 days of the close of an underwriting period, the
bank subsidiary would have to divest enough of the issue it
has underwritten to meet other limits, such as the
restriction on subsidiaries' investment holdings. That limit
is currently $15 million. The proposal would increase the
limit to $25 million. The increase is warranted, the Fed
said, because of the growth in capital at U.S. banks
operating overseas.

   Du Pont and HEM
   Settle Lawsuits
   Over AIDS Drug

<LP>
   Du Pont Co. and HEM Research Inc. agreed to settle
litigation stemming from the collapse of their joint venture
with an experimental AIDS drug.
   Under the agreement, Du Pont will pay HEM $2.8 million,
give up the 5% stake in HEM that it acquired in 1987 and
relinquish certain marketing and royalty rights to the drug,
called Ampligen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement, announced yesterday by HEM, brings to an
end the lawsuits that ensued after the close of a big
clinical trial meant to determine whether Ampligen slowed the
progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
patients infected with the AIDS virus.
   Du Pont, the Wilmington, Del., chemicals giant, had
quickly allied itself with HEM after HEM researchers reported
in the British medical journal Lancet encouraging but
inconclusive results from a small trial of Ampligen. Du Pont
has since said in court papers that it invested more than $30
million in HEM and its work with Ampligen, including the
large trial, which involved more than 300 patients.
   But after Ampligen failed to show efficacy in the large
trial, Du Pont alleged that it had been provided misleading
information by HEM, a closely held company based in
Philadelphia. Du Pont said the damages sought in its suit,
filed in a Delaware state court, far exceeded HEM's net worth
of $8.5 million at the end of 1988.
   HEM, for its part, has contended that the plastic bags Du
Pont used to package Ampligen, which is given intravenously,
impaired the drug's potency. During the initial trial
reported in the Lancet, the drug was packaged in glass
bottles.
   HEM countersued Du Pont, seeking $7.4 million it said it
was owed by Du Pont, plus other damages under
breach-of-contract claims. Those claims, as well as Du
Pont's, were dropped under the pact.
   E. Paul Charlap, HEM's chairman and chief executive
officer, called the settlement a "favorable outcome" for HEM.
A Du Pont spokesman replied that "both sides had claims and
counterclaims, and we came to this agreement."
   Even as the settlement was reached, though, another point
of contention between HEM and Du Pont arose. Although Du Pont
is to give its unused vials of Ampligen to HEM under the
accord, Du Pont destroyed raw material used to make the drug,
an anti-viral agent fashioned from double-stranded
ribonucleic acid.
   HEM officials estimated that the raw material could have
been used to make enough Ampligen to treat some 3,000
patients for a year. "Obviously, this is going to cause this
little company a lot of trouble" in expanding future trials,
said William M. Mitchell, a consultant to HEM and a pathology
professor at Vanderbilt University, adding that HEM had
thought it might gain possession of the material.
   The Du Pont spokesman said, "We had asked" HEM about the
raw material during settlement talks, "and they had no
interest. We had no use for it, so we destroyed it."
   About 30 people infected with the AIDS virus continue to
be treated with Ampligen from glass bottles under HEM's
auspices. In addition, HEM said, it recently expanded its
U.S. clinical trials in the use of Ampligen against a
virus-caused blindness related to AIDS and is seeking
clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to broaden
its trials in AIDS-related disorders.

   Industrials Climb 19.55 to 2999.75
   On Strength of Earnings Reports

   NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a
new record yesterday, closing just a fraction under 3000.
   The industrials closed 19.55 higher at 2999.75, the third
consecutive high.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In early trading it seemed as if the industrial average
would easily close above the 3000 mark. Many key earnings
reports turned out better than expected. International
Business Machines hit the high end of analysts' expectations,
announcing earnings of $2.45 a share for the second quarter.
Investors pushed the stock up 1 3/8 to 122 3/8 in turnover of
2.2 million shares.
   United Technologies, another stock in the industrial
average, gained 1 1/2 to 60 3/8 after an upbeat earnings
announcement late Friday.
   NCR Corp., a computer maker, rocketed 3 7/8 to 68 after
reporting strong second-quarter earnings, and other
technology issues followed the stock higher. Digital
Equipment, for example, climbed 7/8 to 85 1/8.
   Yet for all the celebration, caution prevailed. As the
industrial average seesawed around the 3000 level yesterday,
the pace of trading began to slow in the afternoon -- a clear
sign that money managers aren't enthusiastically chasing
stocks to new highs. New York Stock Exchange volume was a
moderate 149,430,000 shares. The rally was fairly narrow: 868
issues advanced on the Big Board while 678 fell.
   "It is probably the most unexciting record high I've
seen," said Robert Devine, head of equity trading at UBS
Securities. "There is no euphoria. A lot of money managers
have been in the wrong stocks, such as cyclicals," or shares
whose fortunes swing with the economy. "It's been a wacky
trip up; portfolio managers are not happy."
   There are dozens of buy orders below current prices, says
Thomas Gallagher, head of equity trading at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
But many investors think the market is too expensive right
now. "Nobody is committing," said Mr. Gallagher.
   Foreign investors, who can really push the stock market
when they jump in, were also buying lightly yesterday. "I am
surprised that the Japanese investors have not been in here
in a bigger way," said Thomas Callahan, senior vice president
at Yamaichi International (America) Inc. "The market's on the
move and that's the kind they like, but the way the currency
has been acting is a definite negative for them." Lately, the
dollar has been falling against the yen, which would diminish
returns on U.S. stocks for a Japanese investor.
   Joseph DeMarco, head of equity trading at Marinvest,
added: "I don't know of any other industry where they are
setting new highs and people are so miserable." Mr. DeMarco
said he's cautious because of the lagging Dow utility index,
which fell 0.31 to 205.86 yesterday. The weak utility average
is a sign that interest rates aren't falling much further, he
said. "The stock market wants to see further easing" of
interest rates before it moves higher, he added.
   Yesterday, investors sought out shares of banks with sound
earnings, while dumping those of several other financial
concerns.
   J.P. Morgan jumped 2 1/8 to 37 7/8; NCNB rose 1 3/4 to 36
1/2. Second-quarter net at Morgan rose slightly from a year
ago, while NCNB reported a 50% earnings increase.
   Chase Manhattan lost 1/2 to 20 3/4 on 2.4 million shares
after reporting that its second-quarter net fell 62%. First
Chicago declined 1 to 27 5/8; its net for the quarter fell
35%.
   Manufacturers Hanover tumbled 7/8 to 30 7/8.
Prudential-Bache Securities issued a sell recommendation on
the stock and said the company's dividend may be vulnerable.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Fed is
developing additional steps to tighten banks' capital
requirements.
   Among broader averages, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
set an all-time high, climbing 1.64 to 368.95; the previous
mark was 367.40, set June 4. New records were also
established in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index, which
gained 1.45 to 342.67; and the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index, which rose 0.80 to 201.13.
   McDonnell Douglas dropped 2 1/2 to 42 3/8 after outlining
a cost-cutting program, calling for a reduction of about 11%
in its work force and other moves, aimed at saving more than
$700 million annually.
   Warrants of RJR Nabisco Holdings slipped 3/8 to 7 as the
company launched a $6.9 billion recapitalization program,
which will reduce its debt load. Among other things, the plan
calls for RJR to sell $1.7 billion of newly issued common
stock to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $6.25 a share.
   Cummins Engine advanced 3 1/8 to 54 3/8 after agreeing to
sell a 27% aggregate stake to Ford Motor, Tenneco and Kubota
of Japan for $250 million.
   Mattel, which skidded 2 1/8 Friday, rebounded 1 7/8 to 22
3/4 after Kidder Peabody analyst Gary Jacobson made positive
comments on the stock. Mr. Jacobson said the earlier sell-off
was "unwarranted" and presented a buying opportunity.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index gained 1.59
to 365.58, but remains well below its all-time high of
397.03, established last October. Volume totaled 13,690,000
shares.
   Wells-Gardner Electronics climbed 7/8 to 3 7/8 after
estimating that its second-quarter earnings at between 19
cents and 23 cents a share, compared with less than one cent
a share a year earlier.
   New Line Cinema gained 7/8 to 16 1/4.
   Live Entertainment announced an Oct. 4 release date for
its home-video version of the company's "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" movie.
   Mitchell Energy &amp; Development rose 3/4 to 18 1/8. Earnings
for the fiscal year ending next January could rise to around
75 cents a share from 65 cents a year ago, Barron's magazine
reported.

   U.S. Will Pursue
   Ties to Opposition
   In the Soviet Union

   PARIS -- The U.S. will try to build bridges to the
non-Communist political opposition in the Soviet Union, just
as Washington has reached out to other non-Communist
political groups in Eastern Europe, Secretary of State James
Baker said.
   "I don't think that's inappropriate just because it's the
Soviet Union," he said. He added that he agreed to some
extent with those who say the U.S. should step up contacts
with such Soviet opposition figures as Russian Republic
President Boris Yeltsin and the mayors of Moscow and
Leningrad, all of whom quit the Communist Party last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the secretary of state said only that the U.S. should
"touch base" with the Soviet opposition "to make sure that we
understand where the opposition is coming from, that they
understand where we are coming from."
   That stops well short of the outright political support
the U.S. granted to non-Communist groups in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Baker gave no hint that the administration is planning to
withdraw its strong backing for President Mikhail Gorbachev,
who still heads the Soviet Communist Party.
   Nevertheless, the new policy represents a change. When Mr.
Yeltsin visited Washington last year, he was given a curt,
low-key reception, and administration officials later
expressed a dim view of him.
   Separately, the U.S. has proposed that the four victorious
World War II powers retain their rights to approve Germany's
borders, even after that country is unified, until the
Germans sign a treaty guaranteeing their border with Poland.
   Mr. Baker, who was flying here for the "two plus four"
talks on German unification, told reporters that the U.S.
will introduce this idea at the negotiations starting today.
The talks are being held by the foreign ministers of the two
Germanys and the four World War II victors -- the U.S., the
Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   For this week's session of the talks, the third in the
series, the Polish foreign minister also will be present.
Last week, Poland demanded that the allies retain their
rights in Germany to help force adoption of a border treaty,
and Mr. Baker's comments appeared designed to reassure the
Poles.
   The U.S. idea on the Polish border represents a rare move
by the Bush administration to pressure West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who in recent months has been the Western leader
closest to the U.S. The aim is to reassure Poland that a
powerful united Germany won't violate Poland's border as Nazi
Germany did in 1939.
   Mr. Kohl has insisted that for legal reasons such a treaty
can't be written until Germany is unified. But the Polish
government fears the Western powers will have no leverage if
they give up their World War II legal rights at the moment of
unification.
   A senior administration official traveling with Mr. Baker
hinted that the U.S. might back off its idea if West Germany
and Poland can agree at today's meeting on some guarantee
that a simple, narrowly written border treaty will be
ratified quickly after the first all-German elections. The
elections are set for Dec. 2. He noted that Poland's
government has told the other powers it isn't aiming at
disrupting Germany's unification.
   Even as a negotiating tactic, however, the U.S. proposal
represents a significant policy change. The U.S. has insisted
previously that the World War II victors relinquish all
rights when unification occurs.

   Bad Loans Hurt

   Slipped; Security Pacific
   Says Profit Gained 5.8%

   Rising loan problems, especially on commercial real
estate, and a slowdown in corporate borrowing crippled
second-quarter earnings of several major banks.
   Chase Manhattan Corp. posted a 62% drop in earnings, while
at First Chicago Corp. and Bank of New York Co. earnings
tumbled 35% and 39%, respectively. Earnings at Los
Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp. gained only 5.8% because
of loan problems, and New Jersey's Midlantic Corp. reported a
loss because of a large provision for possible future losses
on loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   NCNB Corp. also had a larger-than-expected addition to its
reserves for loan problems. However, earnings at the
Charlotte, N.C., bank were up 50% from a year earlier because
the latest quarter's results reflect its 100% ownership of
its Texas bank.
   Only New York-based J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., which plays a minor
role in real estate finance, reported shrinkage in problem
loans. However, slack corporate finance activity kept its
results about flat.
   If there was a silver lining in the results, it was that
there were no surprises. As James J. McDermott Jr., research
director of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., said, "The market
anticipated generally weak results, and that's what was
served up."
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chase
Manhattan fell 50 cents to $20.75. First Chicago closed at
$27.625, down $1. Security Pacific was off 12.5 cents to
$36.25. Bank of New York closed at $28.625, down 75 cents.
   J.P. Morgan shares made a strong showing, rising $2.125 to
$37.875, and NCNB rose $1.75 to $36.50. In national
over-the-counter trading, Midlantic closed up 62.5 cents at
$14.75.
                                                                                                       

   Chase Manhattan Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Problem real estate loans continued to mushroom at the
U.S.'s second largest banking company. Past-due real estate
loans as well as foreclosed properties rose 52% to $1.75
billion from $1.15 billion as of March 31.
   And Chase's comments offered no guarantee that an end to
the real estate woes is in sight. "If economic conditions in
domestic real estate markets continue to be adverse, it is
likely that the provision for possible credit losses will
continue at relatively high levels," it said.
   As a result, Chase's provision for loan-loss reserves for
the quarter was $225 million, identical to what was set aside
in the year's first quarter and $75 million more than the
provision for the year-earlier quarter. If the provision had
been the same as a year earlier, Chase's results would have
been on a par with those of last year's second quarter.
   Charge-offs of bad loans more than doubled to $763
million. That increase included $374 million in charge-offs
for Brazilian loans and $172 million for Argentine loans.
   The good news in Chase's results was that net interest
income rose 6% to $835 million on a taxable equivalent basis,
reflecting both higher margins and volume on consumer
lending. The rise was especially encouraging because the
year-earlier quarter included $36 million in Brazilian
interest payments and the latest quarter had none. The latest
net interest figure also was after a $22 million charge for
investment hedges that were sold.
   Other operating income rose slightly to $499 million on
the strength of higher consumer, investment banking and
fiduciary fees. Both foreign-exchange trading profit and
gains from the sales of securities were lower in the quarter.
                                                                                                       

   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   Strong trading results on a variety of products,
especially swaps contracts and Third World debt, offset weak
net interest income and lagging fees from corporate finance.
   Trading results of $234 million were up 55% from a year
earlier, while fees from corporate finance, such as mergers
and acquisition advisory work, fell 27% to $61 million. Net
interest income fell 9% to $286 million, largely reflecting
the absence of Brazilian interest payments.
   Commenting on the quarter, Chairman Dennis Weatherstone
said: "Trading activities across the board have produced
excellent results, as they did in the first quarter. Fees
from corporate finance activities declined in a difficult
environment but still made a good contribution. Fees were
strong from investment management, private banking and
operational services -- business activities to which we look
for steady growth."
   Going counter to an industrywide trend, Morgan's loan
quality -- already the strongest in the industry -- continued
to improve. Non-accruing loans dropped 49% to $876 million.
In the quarter, Morgan charged off $120 million of Brazilian
loans and $77 million of Argentine loans. At the end of the
quarter, Morgan's medium-term and long-term loans to
countries involved in refinancing their bank debt totaled
$1.5 billion, less than half of what it was a year earlier.
                                                                                                       

   Security Pacific Corp.
                                                                                                       

   The Los Angeles company was hit by a fairly sharp increase
in credit problems linked to continuing problems in the
Arizona commercial real estate market and other areas. The
company cited rising non-interest income and limited expense
growth as favorable trends, but overall profitability, as
measured by return on assets, declined slightly to 0.89%. At
June 30, Security Pacific had $94.5 billion in total assets,
compared with $84.3 billion a year earlier.
   The company said loan charge-offs, excluding developing
country debt, rose to $159.6 million from $108.8 million a
year earlier and that the company's provision for future loan
losses rose to $160.7 million from $111.6 million.
   As of June 30, nonperforming loans and leases totaled
$1.87 billion, a 7% increase from March 31 and 14% higher
than a year earlier.
   Net interest income grew just 4%. The company said its net
interest margin declined to 3.90% from 4.07% because of the
sale of certain credit card loans, higher nonperforming loans
and narrower spreads between loan yields and the cost of
retail deposits.
                                                                                                       

   NCNB Corp.
                                                                                                       

   NCNB's earnings jump came despite a larger-than-expected
loss provision for problem loans. Per-share earnings,
however, rose only 30%, because this year's second quarter
had more shares outstanding after two stock offerings.
   The latest results included 100% of the operations of NCNB
Texas, formed from the remnants of failed First RepublicBank
Corp. in Dallas, compared with only a 49% ownership a year
earlier. NCNB wouldn't give details of the Texas bank's
bottomline contribution, but a spokesman said, "We had a very
strong quarter in Texas. The earning power in Texas is
everything we anticipated it would be."
   NCNB's earnings gain reflected tight expense controls and
a lower tax rate. Partly because of the addition of the
remaining stake in NCNB Texas, the bank holding company was
able to cut its tax rate to 10% from 26% a year earlier. That
translated into a tax bill of $15.7 million, down from $42.7
million.
   At the same time, blaming a slowing economy and weak real
estate markets, particularly in the Southeast, NCNB said it
significantly increased its allowance for loan losses in the
second quarter to $525.4 million, or about 1.46% of total
loans, from $394 million, or 1.20% of total loans, a year
earlier. Nonperforming assets were $695.2 million as of June
30, compared with $599.1 million as of March 31. At the end
of the 1989 second quarter, nonperforming assets stood at
$335.1 million.

   First Chicago Corp.
                                                                                                       

   First Chicago's results reflected the slowdown in the
commercial banking business. Real estate lending problems
also continued to depress profit.
   Loans for leveraged buy-outs, corporate refinancings and
other usually lucrative lending opportunities have become
scarce in recent months, while some older loans have become
troubled. The quarterly comparison would have been worse but
for a $13.5 million pretax gain from the sale of a credit
card merchant processing business.
   Consumer and middle-market banking operations performed
better than the company's corporate banking business.
Operating profit at the consumer and middle-market banking
businesses was $61 million, up 39% from a year earlier. The
corporate banking unit's profit nosedived 74%, however, to
$20 million.
   In the second quarter, First Chicago's provision for loan
losses was $85 million, down from an especially high
provision of $160 million in the first quarter, when some
real estate problems popped up. The company charged off $280
million of loans during the quarter, most of it in loans to
less developed countries for which reserves were already
taken, compared with $374 million in the first quarter.
   Total nonperforming loans were $871 million June 30, down
from $1.05 billion March 31. Combined nonperforming real
estate loans and real estate owned through foreclosure and
other means remained high, however, at $624 million compared
with $592 million March 31.
                                                                                                       

   Bank of New York
                                                                                                       

   A $94 million addition to reserves for possible loan
losses resulted in the earnings drop. Of that amount, $71
million was charged for bad domestic loans, and the remaining
$23 million was used to boost the reserve level to $940
million, or 2.62% of loans.
   Nonperforming assets climbed 12% to $1.33 billion,
including an increase of $160 million in real estate loans
and $117 million of highly leveraged corporate loans. As of
June 30, non-performing assets stood at 3.7% of loans, up
slightly from 3.4% March 31.
   Net interest income, before the loan-loss provision, rose
7% to $346 million, while non-interest income gained to $243
million from $237 million.
                                                                                                       

   Midlantic Corp.
                                                                                                       

   A $186 million addition to its reserve for possible losses
on real estate and other commercial loans resulted in the
loss for the quarter at the Edison, N.J., company. The
provision was partly offset by a $68 million gain from the
sale of Midlantic's credit card accounts and receivables to
Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
   Past-due loans and foreclosures in the quarter climbed 29%
to $923 million from $715 million March 31. Net charge-offs
rose 60% to $77 million.
   As of June 30, Midlantic's reserve for losses stood at
$550 million, or 76% of its past-due loans.
   Despite its loan troubles, Chairman Robert Van Buren said
Midlantic's capital levels exceed regulatory minimums by
comfortable margins. At June 30, the company's ratio of
equity to assets was 6.4%, down from 6.9% a year earlier.
   For the quarter, net interest income dropped to $223
million, compared with $226 million a year earlier, and the
net interest margin shrank to 4.06% from 4.61% in the first
quarter. The tighter margin reflected the higher deposit
rates being paid by the company's banks to bolster liquidity
as well as the higher levels of nonperforming assets.

   NEW YORK -- Whitman Corp. is negotiating to sell its
Hussmann Corp. commercial refrigerator manufacturing unit to
Sanyo Electric Co. for $500 million to $600 million,
according to people familiar with the talks.
   Sanyo, a maker of consumer electronics and appliances
based in Osaka, Japan, last week submitted the highest bid
for the St. Louis-based Hussmann unit, according to people
familiar with the bidding. However, even Sanyo's bid was
somewhat below Whitman's expectations, and Whitman must now
decide whether to proceed with the sale, the people said. In
addition, Whitman is trying to see whether any other bidders
will offer a price or terms for Hussmann that are more
attractive than Sanyo's bid. The exact terms of Sanyo's bid
couldn't be determined.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Whitman said the company received bids for
Hussmann last week, but declined to identify the bidders or
comment on whether Sanyo was among them. "When a
determination is made as to the adequacy of the bids, we will
announce it to the public," the spokesman said.
   In Osaka, a Sanyo spokesman said he had no information on
any talks with Whitman. The spokesman said the company's
policy is not to comment on mergers or acquisitions until
they have been arranged.
   Whitman said in March it would explore the possible sale
of Hussmann to concentrate on its packaged goods and
soft-drink business. Whitman makes candies and owns the Pet
Inc. food manufacturer, a Pepsi Cola bottling operation and
the Midas International auto service shop franchiser.
   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., a New York investment banking firm,
has handled the Hussmann auction for Whitman. A Morgan
Stanley spokesman declined to comment.
   The price for Hussmann could disappoint Wall Street
analysts, some of whom who had estimated that Hussmann could
command a price of more than $700 million. Lately, estimates
of Hussmann's price have been dropping, encouraged by
Whitman's management.
   Joel Tiss, a conglomerate analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said Whitman officials told him that after-tax
proceeds from the Hussmann sale "will range between $400
million and $500 million." He added: "Our own estimates say
it should be toward the lower end of that."
   Mr. Tiss said that his original estimate of Hussmann's
pretax sale price was between $600 million and $800 million
but that the actual sale price "might be closer to $600
million to $750 million."
   A Whitman official confirmed that the company's chairman
had told analysts recently that after-tax proceeds from the
sale would be between $400 million and $500 million.
   David S. Moore, a conglomerate analyst at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said he is expecting
Whitman to realize after-tax proceeds of about $525 million,
which he said implied a pretax sale price of "close to $600
million."
   Mr. Moore said he is concerned that the sale of Hussmann,
which had a small loss in the first quarter, "might be bad
timing. We think strategically, it's a sound move, but we're
not convinced that the timing is absolutely perfect."
   Sanyo is a major producer of refrigerators in Asian and
Pacific markets. Sanyo has a plant in San Diego that makes
small refrigerators and in 1986 bought a plant in Indiana
that makes large refrigerators for the consumer market.
   Hussmann has about 40% to 45% of the market for
refrigerators and refrigerated display cases for supermarkets
and about 25% of the market for such equipment used in
convenience stores. In 1989, Hussmann had a profit of $60
million on revenue of $789 million.

   GE Posts Rise
   In Profit of 12%
   For 2nd Quarter

   FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co.'s second-quarter
earnings increased 12%, continuing its four-year string of
double-digit increases as productivity improved in all its
main businesses.
   GE said most of the gains came in its so-called
longer-cycle businesses, such as aircraft engines,
power-generation systems and medical equipment, where sales
cycles are long and where GE's manufacturing operations are
working off a huge backlog of orders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some of the shorter-cycle businesses, such as appliances
and materials, did less well -- although the appliance
business still had "much higher" operating profit despite
roughly flat revenue.
   As a result, GE said its operating profit margin rose to
12.9% of sales, eclipsing GE's record of 12.1% set in the
year-earlier quarter. GE said the improved margin and strong
order backlogs in the longer-cycle businesses mean that the
double-digit earnings growth should continue through the end
of the year.
   The stock, after rising Friday in anticipation of the
earnings report, was flat yesterday at $74.875 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   "The quarter was in line with expectations," Mark Altman,
a securities analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc., said in
explaining why the stock didn't rise. "But that's not to say
the expectations weren't very high."
   Net income in the quarter totaled $1.09 billion, or $1.22
a share, up from $972 million, or $1.08 a share, a year
earlier; revenue rose 7% to $14.35 billion from $13.53
billion.
   In the first half, earnings increased 12% to $2.04
billion, or $2.28 a share, from $1.82 billion, or $2.02 a
share. Revenue climbed 6% to $26.95 billion from $25.43
billion.
   Commenting by product line, GE said operating profit and
revenue were both up strongly on aircraft engines and
power-generation systems. GE said it received about $2
billion of orders for power-generation systems in the first
half, with demand for gas turbines especially high.
   Among the other long-cycle businesses, technical products
and services had a "good" increase in operating profit on
"slightly higher" revenue as orders for medical systems
increased 15%. Aerospace operations -- such as radar and
satellites -- had flat revenue, and operating profit
declined.
   Industrial operations -- an agglomeration of businesses
such as lighting, electric motors and locomotives -- had flat
revenue, but operating profit was "well ahead" of a year
earlier.
   Among the short-cycle operations, revenue was flat for
appliances and materials. Although profit on appliances rose,
it was flat for the materials operations. GE said its NBC
broadcasting unit had "somewhat" lower earnings and revenue.
   GE financial services reported a 16% increase in earnings,
as GE Capital again did well.

   McDonnell to Cut as Many as 17,000 Jobs
   This Year; Most Will Be in Long Beach

   Acknowledging that McDonnell Douglas Corp. "made some
mistakes in the course of our reorganizations," John
McDonnell, chairman, said the struggling aerospace giant will
eliminate 14,000 to 17,000 jobs, or at least 11% of its
world-wide work force, by year's end.
   The announcement by the nation's No. 1 Pentagon contractor
is by far the single largest layoff notice issued this year
by any aerospace concern, and it exceeded expectations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many other aerospace companies, including Boeing Co.,
General Dynamics Corp., Lockheed Corp. and Northrop Corp.,
have also said in recent months they are scaling back their
work forces. But St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, with
several military aircraft lines slated for termination and
manufactuing problems still dogging its commercial-airliner
business, finds itself in an especially dire situation.
   Although it has a $27 billion backlog of orders for its
MD-80s and MD-11s, the company hasn't posted a profit at its
transport aircraft unit in Long Beach, Calif., since 1988;
excessive overhead has been much of the problem.
   The bulk of the job cuts, part of previously disclosed
plans to slash $700 million annually from the company's cost
structure, will come at the Long Beach subsidiary, though
skilled assemblers and electrical workers may actually be
added to help with a brisk jetliner-delivery schedule.
Already, some 2,400 employees on the payroll have been laid
off there, and 1,500 contract personnel have lost their
assignments. By year-end, the goal is to trim a total of
8,000 jobs from the site, the bulk of them white-collar
positions.
   Yet hourly workers still fear the worst. "People are
running scared," said Richard Rios, recently elected
president of United Auto Workers Local 148, which represents
nearly 20,000 of the rank and file at the Long Beach factory.
"A lot of new people here went out and bought homes, and now
they're wondering about their mortgages."
   Peter Lazes, director of a Cornell University program that
is exploring how military suppliers can help their workers
adjust to the changing political environment, declared: "The
meltdown of the industry has begun."
   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said
"additional {debt} rating declines are likely" for defense
contractors in the next three to five years, reflecting the
industry's slowdown. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. credit-rating
unit made the prediction in a report on a study of 16 defense
contractors, including four European companies.
   For some, though, announcement of the planned McDonnell
layoffs was anticlimactic. Late last week, rumors of bigger
events ran rampant through the company and the financial
markets; they included such speculation as the resignation of
Mr. McDonnell or a Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing. Although
McDonnell Douglas vehemently denied the conjecture and most
Wall Street analysts dismissed it as gossip, investors
yesterday were apparently disappointed that McDonnell Douglas
isn't doing more.
   "When none of the speculation came to pass, it looks like
people just sold off," said Paul Nisbet, of Prudential-Bache
Securities. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
McDonnell Douglas shares closed at $42.50, down $2.375.
   Besides the job reductions in Long Beach, about 4,500
slots will be eliminated in the St. Louis area, where
McDonnell Douglas builds jet fighters for the Navy and Air
Force. In addition, there will be retrenchment at other
facilities in Missouri, Southern California, Arizona and a
score of other states where McDonnell Douglas has offices and
manufacturing operations. The company's world-wide employment
is 135,000.
   Mr. McDonnell explained in a letter to employees yesterday
that, while the company has taken a series of major steps to
curb costs in the past 18 monts, "we did not do enough to
establish the boundaries that would prevent excessive
duplication of functions and services, and we did not
exercise sufficient control over costs and staffing."
   "It took us too long to recognize that we had too many
people on the payroll," Mr. McDonnell said, adding that "I
accept responsibility for the fact that we must take these
harsh actions now."
   In addition to paring back jobs, Mr. McDonnell said other
moves will be taken to correct the company's "unsatisfactory
financial performance," which featured operating losses in
three of four quarters last year and a break-even result for
the first three months of 1990.
   These actions include:
   -- Temporarily reducing by 50% company contributions to
salaried savings plans, which had been matching 75 cents on
the dollar, in a bid to save as much as $60 million a year.
   -- Shaving the capital budgets at each of the company's
seven divisions by an unspecified amount.
   -- Making "significant cuts" in budgets for travel,
consultants, advertising and other support activities.
   -- Restricting overtime payments to certain salaried
employees.
   Mr. McDonnell reiterated that the $700 million in cost
savings -- about $12 a share in terms of earnings, according
to Prudential-Bache's Mr. Nisbet -- was necessary to
"generate and obtain the large amounts of cash needed to
fund" the MD-11 three-engine commercial jet. The wide-body
plane will cost some $2 billion this year to develop, and
many analysts have identified it as the key to restoring
McDonnell Douglas's financial health.

   Limited Partnership Resale Market Suffers
   ----

   Bad news continues to hammer the informal resale, or
secondary, market for limited partnerships.
   Resale prices of many partnerships fell in the second
quarter, as more sponsors slashed payouts to investors or
revealed plans to convert their partnerships into new,
publicly traded investments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These are some of the findings of the latest Wall Street
Journal survey of trading at a number of small investment
firms that buy partnership interests from investors, either
for their own accounts or for resale to new investors. The
survey covered resale-market trading in 20 widely held
partnerships during the quarter ended June 30.
   The partnerships in the survey are a small sample of the
nearly $90 billion of such investments sold publicly by major
Wall Street brokerage firms and other syndicators since the
late 1970s. About half invested in real estate or mortgages,
while the rest of the money they raised went into everything
from leasing jetliners to drilling for oil and operating
cable-television systems.
   Designed as long-term ventures, partnerships typically
have lives of about 10 years before their assets are sold and
investors are paid off. But at least 20% of older
partnerships are foundering, according to brokerage-industry
estimates. The resale market, informal and inefficient as it
is, is about the only outlet for investors who want to get
out before a partnership runs its normal course.
   The best prices investors got when selling the 11 real
estate partnerships in the survey during the latest quarter
were about 46%, on average, below their original prices. The
average discount was about 35% in the previous quarter.
   Out of a total of 20 partnerships in the survey, 17
changed hands in the latest period, the same number as in the
first quarter. The best prices sellers got plummeted,
however, to 42% below the original offering prices. The
overall average discount was about 35% in the previous
quarter.
   At these depressed prices, several partnerships in the
survey offer seemingly high yields to new investors. But the
estimated recent yields can be deceptive. They are based on
cash distributions for the latest four quarters divided by
current prices. There isn't any guarantee the partnerships
will continue to provide that income.
   Indeed, Ross Bowler, president of 2nd Market Capital
Services, a Madison, Wis., secondary-market firm, says,
"Dozens and dozens of partnerships have cut or eliminated
their distributions in the last few months."
   Also depressing prices in the second quarter were
partnership "roll-ups," including a massive one involving a
partnership in the survey, Equitec Real Estate Investors Fund
XV.
   "The Equitec roll-up has definitely had an impact on the
prices of other partnerships," says Jim Frith, president of
Chicago Partnership Board Inc., another secondary-market
firm. With so many other sponsors in financial straits, "a
lot of people are nervous there will be more roll-ups and
historically, they have been a really bad deal for the
limited partners."
   In a roll-up, several non-traded limited partnerships,
typically including some healthy ones and some that aren't,
are consolidated into new, publicly traded investments.
Limited partners usually approve the reorganization to gain
liquidity. But the price of the new units once they begin
trading typically sinks far below the supposed exchange value
syndicators put on them.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has said it is
studying the fairness of roll-ups to investors. A
congressional subcommittee headed by Rep. Edward J. Markey
(D., Mass.) also plans hearings on the issue later this
summer.
   The Equitec partnership included in the survey is one of
11 partnerships sponsored by Equitec Financial Group,
Oakland, Calif., that are included in a roll-up by Hallwood
Group Inc., a New York merchant bank. Hallwood is asking
about 87,000 investors in the 11 partnerships to exchange
their interests for newly issued units of Hallwood Realty
L.P., a master limited partnership to be listed on the
American Stock Exchange.
   Separately, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. has said it
is considering a roll-up that would include another
partnership in the survey, Prudential-Bache Energy Income
Series III-14.
   The tainted reputation roll-ups are gaining is prompting
some other sponsors to consider converting individual limited
partnerships to real estate investment trusts that would
eventually trade publicly.
   New York syndicator W.P. Carey &amp; Co. says it is among
those pondering the idea, which could affect its Corporate
Property Associates 3 included in the survey.
   Public Storage Inc., a Glendale, Calif., sponsor has filed
preliminary plans with the SEC to convert two of its
partnerships to REITs, Public Storage Properties X Ltd. and
Public Storage Properties XI Ltd. But the conversion wouldn't
affect its partnership in the Journal survey, PS Partners VI
Ltd.
   Another issue confronting many partnership investors
lately, is the prospect of changing management, as some
partnership syndicators sell their interests to others. One
partnership affected is Consolidated Capital Institutional
Properties 2, which is included in the survey.
   Consolidated Capital Equities Corp. plans to sell its
general partner and management interests in that partnership
and 15 others it sponsored to ConCap Equities Inc., a newly
formed group of real estate development and property
management companies. The sale is subject to approval by
limited partners.

   Tokyo stock prices moved up strongly in moderate trading
that was focused on stocks with bright earnings outlooks,
traders said. Buying was prompted by widespread expectation
that domestic interest rates probably won't rise further, the
traders said.
   In London, shares gained in a moderately active session,
supported by futures-led buying, a strong showing on Wall
Street, and better-than-expected U.K. retail sales figures.
</LP>

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 377.36 points to
33021.73, ending above 33000 for the first time since June 6.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index
advanced 145.41 points to 33167.14.
   Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 580
million shares, up from 512.6 million shares Friday.
Advancers outnumbered decliners 691-277, while 163 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was up 30.32 points, or 1.28%, at 2400.16.
   The second section index advanced 9.91 points, or 0.22%,
to 4477.16. Volume was estimated at 33 million shares, down
from 41.3 million shares Friday.
   The market opened amid improved momentum on the eased
credit stance by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, which led to
strong advances in New York stocks Friday.
   The Fed's move helped to reduce expectations for a further
rise of Japanese interest rates, which have been holding
investors off from active buying, traders said.
   They added that surprisingly little selling helped push up
stock prices widely. Advances for the futures indexes, which
ended the day at or just below intraday highs, made investors
hold on to their stocks without taking profits at yesterday's
level, traders said.
   While higher-rates possibilities have faded, there's also
little expectation among participants that the Fed's move
will help to push down Japanese interest rates, as Japan's
money supply has remained at high levels in recent months and
the country's economy continues to perform well.
   With domestic short-term interest rates remaining at
attractively high levels, institutional investors are
unlikely to become active buyers, said Shigeru Akiba, head of
equity at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International.
   If June money supply data to be disclosed Friday show
high-paced growth, investors may again start talking about
the possibility for interest rates to rise, the Phillips &amp;
Drew official said.
   Institutions are also waiting to see results of a series
of U.S. economic indicators due later this week, including
consumer prices, as well as the testimony of U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan tomorrow, to judge the
direction for U.S. interest rates, traders said.
   With both exchange rates and bond prices remaining
relatively stable yesterday, stock investors mostly focused
on corporate earnings outlooks as incentives for buying,
traders said.
   Strong advances for Sony and Kyocera early in the morning
session prompted gains for other companies whose earnings are
expected to grow strongly in coming years, traders said. A
wide range of electronics shares and public spending-related
shares set the pace of advances during the afternoon session.
   Gains for some construction and housing companies prompted
heavy selling in midafternoon on profit-taking, said
Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at Okasan
Securities.
   "But they managed to finish higher, absorbing the
selling," Mr. Ito said. "That's a good sign that market
turnover is improving," he said.
   Sony finished up 80 yen to 9080 yen (54 cents to $61.31).
Kyocera ended at 9220 yen, up 60 yen.
   Shipbuilding companies closed higher, with
Ishikawajima-Harima gaining 29 yen to 1020 yen, and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rising 20 yen to 1000 yen.
   Blue-chip issues advanced briskly. Toyota Motor gained 70
yen to 2340 yen, while Fuji Photo Film advanced 200 yen to
4920 yen.
   In London, shares were in demand from the outset, dealers
said, as this past week's rise in New York equities filtered
into optimism for the U.K. market, on the belief that the
broad-based index would be able to breach the 2400-point
barrier.
   By late morning, news of a larger-than-expected drop in
June's retail sales helped lift the index across the
2400-point line and beyond. Provisional June retail sales
showed a 2.8% decline from May, and a 0.9% drop from a year
ago.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
24.3 points to 2406.5. The index reached as high as 2410
points.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index advanced 20.8 points to
1900.9. Volume amounted to 346.9 million shares, compared
with 399.2 million shares Friday.
   Although some profit-taking set in during the late
afternoon to topple the index from midafternoon intraday
peaks, good demand for stock-index futures contracts and a
buoyant early effort on Wall Street left the market with a
firm undertone, dealers said. A shortage of stock in some of
the blue-chip leaders will likely lead to another rise today,
analysts predicted.
   Glaxo gained 15 pence to 870 pence (27 cents to $15.70)
and Reuters rose 25 pence to #13.14; both issues were cited
by dealers as stocks specifically helped by a shortage of
their shares.
   Wellcome fell 10 pence to 585 pence after a downgrading by
Hoare Govett Ltd., following downgradings a week ago by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. and James Capel &amp; Co.
   Carlton Communications continued to suffer from a
downgrading last week, finishing down 25 pence at 435 pence.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Amsterdam,
Brussels, Madrid and Milan, mixed in Frankfurt and Zurich,
and lower in Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed
higher.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Sydney, Wellington, Manila
and Singapore, and lower in Hong Kong, Seoul and Taipei.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each

   Aircraft Retrofitter
   Gets Jury Award
   Of $70.8 Million

   VAN NUYS, Calif. -- A state court jury here ordered
General Electric Capital Corp. to pay $70.8 million in
damages to a small aircraft retrofitter that claims it was
nearly put out of business when the General Electric Co. unit
pulled the plug on financing for a joint venture between the
companies.
   The jury awarded the Van Nuys-based retrofitter, American
Aviation Industries Inc., $65 million in compensatory damages
and $5.8 million in punitive damages against GE Capital, plus
ownership of engine housings from the venture valued at about
$1.5 million. On counterclaims, the jury awarded GE Capital
and its parent $9.8 million for loans owed it by American
Aviation plus engines and an aircraft valued at an additional
$6 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "GE Capital regards the awards to AAI of compensatory and
punitive damages as unwarranted and is confident that they
will be set aside in further proceedings," GE Capital said.
   American Aviation was set up in late 1983 by Aviation
Consultants Inc., an aircraft leasing concern, with the
intention of retrofitting aging aircraft with new,
longer-range engines. In 1984, American Aviation entered into
a joint venture agreement with GE to retrofit Lockheed Corp.
JetStar corporate aircraft with GE turbofan engines that
would allow the aircraft to make transoceanic flights.
   The updated aircraft, called FanStars, would have cost
one-third to one-half as much as comparable planes, American
Aviation said, and the company estimated that the project
could bring in profit of as much as $105 million. All that
was needed was an investment of about $23 million to get the
aircraft refitted and certified by the Federal Aviation
Administration. GE Capital provided financing.
   But in early 1987, GE Capital began to tighten the purse
strings, claiming that its studies showed that only 20 of the
retrofitted aircraft could be sold instead of the 75 or so
originally projected. GE Capital required American Aviation's
owners to put up 100% of their stock as collateral for a $2.5
million loan, then refused to fund the loan without
concessions from management, American Aviation said.
   The small company's efforts to arrange alternative
financing through Advest Corp. and a separate investor group
fell through when GE Capital argued against it with potential
investors, American Aviation has claimed. In the end, the
FanStar was never certified, and no retrofitted planes were
sold.
   The jury in the case found against GE Capital for breach
of contract and "intentional interference with prospective
economic advantage."

its Gemini line of silicon-wafer fabrication systems.
   The semiconductor-industry equipment supplier said the
decision will result in a net loss for the fourth quarter and

   The new company will sell paper collected by Oak Brook,

Management is collecting increasing amounts of recyclable
paper, aluminum and plastic through its curbside collections,
under its Recycle America program.

   Chicago-based Stone, which is already a big manufacturer
of recycled paper and has under way a $200 million program to

   A major impediment to paper-recycling efforts has been the
absence of solid long-term markets for collected waste.

   How to Choose a Highflying Airline Stock:
   Does the Carrier Profit From a Rival's Woes?

   Maybe the way to pick an airline stock is to figure out
which carrier is in the best position to profit from
another's troubles.
   Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines fly on
financially weary wings. Eastern is operating under
protection of federal bankruptcy law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If one or more of those companies liquidated or sold out,
Delta Air Lines and American Airlines probably would be the
chief beneficiaries, several money managers and analysts say.
They would enjoy reduced competition on crucial routes. And
they might be able to pick up desirable airport gates and
routes on the cheap.
   Continental Airlines is generally considered too strapped
to do much buying. United Airlines has the financial strength
at the moment, but is preoccupied with an on-again, off-again
employee-led buy-out attempt. And if the buy-out succeeds,
United probably will have taken on too much debt to gobble up
planes or routes.
   Opinion is divided on whether Northwest Airlines, recently
taken private in a leveraged buy-out under the leadership of
Alfred A. Checchi, can afford to buy a rival major airline,
or its assets.
   Delta and American, by contrast, have decent balance
sheets and can afford to buy planes or routes if they wish.
Some money managers also like their stocks because they're
reasonably priced. Delta sells for only nine times the past
12 months' per-share earnings. American sells for 12 times
earnings. Both multiples are below that of the average stock,
reflecting the sluggish economy, fare wars and the industry's
cyclical nature.
   "When some of the weaker sisters are left aside, the other
airlines will grow stronger," says Thomas Longman, airline
analyst at Bear Stearns. It's "likely that fares will move
upward when you don't have carriers that need to discount
just to stay in business."
   Most money managers and analysts say that Delta would be
the chief beneficiary if Eastern stopped flying, while
American would be the likeliest to pick up any turf vacated
by Pan Am or TWA. Eastern is Delta's biggest rival at the
Atlanta hub airport, and also competes with Delta in Florida,
offering aggressively low fares. When Eastern's employees
struck in March 1989, Delta saw a quick 20% jump in revenue.
   Another money manager warns against counting on a replay:
Other competitors could fill Eastern's shoes. He thinks the
benefits from a major carrier's demise would be spread fairly
evenly across the entire industry. But the majority view is
that Delta would benefit most if Eastern falls. "Clearly,
Delta would be the beneficiary if Eastern goes away," says
Ned Davis, president of Ned Davis Research in Nokomis, Fla.
   Pan Am currently has about 14% of the traffic across the
Atlantic. TWA has about 12%. Those routes could make a
tempting target for American or United, both of which now
have transatlantic toeholds. American is "making a concerted
effort to build up their east-west travel between North
America and Europe," says David Elias, a money manager in
Buffalo, N.Y. "If Pan Am did go under, they would probably
pick up a lot of that business, and at very reasonable
prices."
   Pan Am, says Steve Lewins, who follows airline stocks for
Chancellor Capital Management, "is attempting to make it to
Europe 1992" -- the scheduled date for the fall of most trade
barriers in Europe -- by selling off assets. "They keep
chopping up the furniture and throwing it into the fire,"
says Jeffrey S. Halis, a money manager with Gollust, Tierney
&amp; Oliver in New York. "I don't think they have much left to
sell."
   Pan Am has expressed willingness to be sold. But money
managers say potential acquirers are biding their time,
waiting for a truly low price. "The people at American are
very clever tacticians," says Michael Stolper, a San Diego
investment consultant.
   American doesn't need Pan Am's "management, employees {or}
computer systems," says Mr. Lewins. "What it wants are the
routes, the gates, and the slots. I don't think {American CEO
Robert} Crandall wants the baggage. He's playing the waiting
game."
   Mr. Lewins thinks TWA's routes would be a prize capture
for Northwest Airlines, which flies to Scandinavia and
northern Europe. TWA concentrates on southern Europe,
especially the Mediterranean. The routes "fit together like a
clamshell," he says. "The two are perfect together."
Northwest, however, "is still having digestion problems" from
the leveraged buy-out, says Mr. Davis.
   Kevin Murphy, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says it's
dangerous to predict the imminent demise of any airline.
"Airlines never die of a heart attack. They die a slow
death," he says, citing Pan Am's 20-year decline. Still, he
sees opportunities for strong carriers, saying Delta and
American could become the industry's "flying fortresses."
Michael W. Gunn, American's senior vice president for
marketing, says it's "premature to speculate" about any
possible acquisitions.
   Even for any acquirer, there are clouds on the horizon. An
acquisitive carrier's stock might take a short-term hit
because of costs associated with a takeover, such as the
tricky task of sorting out employee seniority. And some
investors don't like airlines dead or alive. "We avoid
airlines like the plague," says Roger Engemann, a money
manager in Pasadena, Calif. "They're cyclical, highly
leveraged, and intensely competitive. It's the worst business
in the world."

   Pennzoil to Boost
   Stake in Chevron
   To Almost 10%

   HOUSTON -- Pennzoil Co. said it intends to raise its stake
in Chevron Corp. to just under 10% by year end from its
current 8.8% stake.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Pennzoil said it would stop purchases slightly below the 10%
threshold to avoid triggering Chevron's poison pill plan.
Pennzoil said that, based on Chevron's recent stock price,
that would limit purchases to about another $291 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In San Francisco, a Chevron spokeswoman said, "We can't
comment until we have a chance to evaluate" Pennzoil's
filing.
   Pennzoil, which first amassed Chevron shares late last
year as a "long-term investment," praised Chevron's recent
operating performance but was critical of what it views as
steps taken to "dilute" earnings and shareholder value.
   Pennzoil's plans to raise the stake aren't surprising.
Pennzoil has indicated that it would invest in Chevron all
the $2.6 billion of proceeds it received from Texaco Inc. to
settle their mammoth legal dispute. So far, Pennzoil has paid
roughly $2.1 billion for about 31.5 million Chevron shares.
Chevron has 355 million common shares outstanding.
   Analysts were puzzled at why Pennzoil would make its
filing now. "The timing is a little odd," said Frederick
Leuffer, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.
in New York. "Chevron's stock is up."
   Chevron shares closed yesterday at $75.125, up $1.125, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Pennzoil bought
its other Chevron shares at an average price of $67 each.
Pennzoil finished yesterday at $79.625, up 50 cents, also on
the Big Board.
   When Pennzoil disclosed its stake in December, Chevron
reacted swiftly by reducing the trigger point for its poison
pill to 10% from 20%. The company also filed suit against
Pennzoil, accusing it of misrepresenting its intentions in
its SEC filings. So far, Pennzoil has won most of the court
battles and a hearing is set for Sept. 14 to rule on
Pennzoil's request to dismiss the rest of the claims.
   In a letter to shareholders, Pennzoil said that "Chevron
appears to be doing well in its efforts to improve its
operating performance," citing a number of asset sales and
plans for oil exploration in the Soviet Union. It was the
potential for improvement that enticed Pennzoil as a holder,
the company said.
   But Pennzoil then appeared to raise the rhetoric against
Chevron management compared with previous disclosures in
which Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke went out of his way
to praise Chevron executives. In the shareholder letter, he
wrote, "Chevron's hostility is extremely disappointing to
us."
   He cited concern about Chevron's Employee Stock Ownership
Plan, for which the company recently borrowed $1 billion.
Pennzoil also criticized a new management incentive plan in
which Chevron can award as much as 1% of its shares
outstanding each year to about 300 key employees. Pennzoil
said that with Chevron's stock price above $70, the value of
the plan this year could come to about $250 million.

   SEC Is Assailed
   Over Supervising
   Financial Planners

CONGRESS (CNG)
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The investigative arm of Congress delivered
a scathing report on the financial-planning industry and
contended that the Securities and Exchange Commission's
oversight "may be doing more harm than good."
   The General Accounting Office study said that investors
may be misled by the SEC's implied "seal of approval" in
licensing financial planners. The process must be improved,
the GAO said, "to provide people who might use an adviser a
minimum level of assurance" that the adviser operates within
the law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The GAO report focuses on an industry that has more than
tripled over the past decade to about 14,000 registered
advisers who now manage roughly $4.6 trillion in assets. As
its basis, the GAO used figures from other studies showing
that advisers defrauded investors of $90 million to $200
million a year. But the agency added that it thought the
figures were low, and some consumer groups put the annual
figure much higher.
   In a response by Kathryn McGrath, former head of the
investment-management division, the SEC conceded that its
oversight is below par but quickly added that doing more
would require much more money. The report offers "laudable
goals that the staff would support in a cost-free
environment," Ms. McGrath said.
   Last spring, Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.) unveiled a bill
that would force all financial planners to register with the
SEC, provide full written disclosure to clients of
compensation and allow customers to sue for damages. As
important, the legislation would give the SEC broader ability
to attack abuse by financial planners, including fining
power.
   Rep. Boucher's bill isn't considered likely to go far this
year, and the first hearing on the matter will be held
tomorrow by the House subcommittee on telecommunications and
finance.
   The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires financial
planners to register with the SEC. But the GAO reported that
a financial planners group, the International Association of
Financial Planning, estimated that there are 100,000 to
300,000 financial planners in the U.S.
   Registration doesn't necessarily improve an investor's
chances of getting a competent adviser, the GAO said.
Planners don't need any training, said the GAO, which quoted
one industry official as saying, "It is easier to become a
registered investment adviser than to become a licensed
driver."
   In one example, the GAO described a woman who lost her
life savings of $60,000 despite being "impressed" that the
adviser was SEC-registered.
   Moreover, the report criticized the agency's inspection of
licensed advisers. The SEC usually inspects advisers for the
first time an average of three years after they are
registered, but many have never been inspected, the report
said.
   The SEC has proposed setting up a self-regulatory
organization for financial planners, but that plan hasn't
gone far.
   The GAO recommended that the SEC inspect all newly
registered advisers within a year and periodically afterward.
The SEC called the proposal "a good idea." Advisers shown to
be riskier should have a shorter leash, with inspections
every six months, the GAO said. In addition, the report
proposed that the SEC verify education and other experience
before granting registration.

   TOKYO -- Clients of Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia Inc. are
used to being sold stocks, bonds and financial services. But
the latest product the firm is pushing comes straight from
above: American Express cards.
   Employees of the stockbroking and investment-banking
subsidiary of American Express Co. are soliciting members for
the parent company's credit-card operation in Japan. Instead
of the commissions that brokers are accustomed to earning,
successful card sellers earn prizes like cameras, golf clubs
and bicycles.
</LP>

   Not surprisingly, officials at Shearson and American
Express don't see any conflict between selling stocks and
promoting credit cards. "A lot of these guys are taking this
seriously," says Marc A. Bouchard, chief operating officer at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia. Still, he adds, "we're not doing
it professionally. And, actually, most people who are being
asked are suppliers rather than clients. It's less
embarrassing."
   American Express says it routinely asks company employees

   Living With a Car
   Before Committing to It

   MORE AUTO shoppers are taking extended test drives by
renting, perhaps for a weekend, the models they are
considering buying.
   The idea has obvious advantages. Test drives at dealers
rarely last longer than 15 minutes or cover more than a few
miles. Moreover, weekend renters can evaluate a car without
having a salesperson around trying to hustle them into a
quick purchase.
   Howard Hirsch, 34-year-old owner of a garment manufacturer
from Woodland Hills, Calif., recently paid $750 to rent a
Mercedes 300SL for a weekend before deciding to go ahead with
a purchase of that model, for $78,000. "For 1% of the price,
you get to take the top off to see how it works," he says.
   Mr. Hirsch wishes he'd rented a Porsche 911 Carrera before
he bought one for $39,000 in 1985. Only after the purchase
did he decide that the driver's seat was uncomfortable, he
says.
   Rental companies don't have numbers on how much test
driving is going on. But they say they've noticed more people
asking for specific models these days, which they take as a
sign of test driving.
   Auto makers are getting in on the trend. Recently, General
Motors' Cadillac division gave free weekend rentals to
shoppers who test drove its models at dealerships. "It's
another way of getting people into our cars," a Cadillac
spokesman says.
                                                                                                       

   Insurance for Lessees
   To Cover All the Bases
                                                                                                       

   PEOPLE WHO LEASE autos now can buy insurance to cover what
their regular car insurance doesn't.
   "Gap insurance" is designed to protect consumers if a
leased car is stolen or destroyed. It also protects the
lenders who finance leases, a growing number of which require
lessees to buy the additional coverage.
   Lenders say the new insurance is important because there's
usually a gap of several thousand dollars between the unpaid
balance of a lease, which the customer must make good on, and
a car's fair market value, which the insurance company pays.
Lessees generally make a smaller down payment, if any, than
do buyers, so the gap between the unpaid balance and the
value of a leased car is wider for longer.
   "This is a protection whose time has come," says John
Vagnozzi, an executive in the auto finance unit of Chase
Manhattan. About a year ago, Chase Manhattan became one of
the first banks to require people who enter auto lease
agreements with them to buy gap insurance. Now the finance
units of Nissan Motor, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz all require
it. Before this year, only four major insurance companies
sold gap insurance; now more than 20 offer it.
   Consumers should watch out for abuses. Most gap insurance
policies cost $125 to $400, but some dealers have offered it
for more than $700. Mercedes-Benz decided to simply include
the insurance as a standard part of its leases instead of
allowing dealers to sell it separately, partly to avoid
questions over cost.
                                                                                                       

   Salespeople Angle
   To Get Some Respect
                                                                                                       

   PROFESSIONAL certification for car salespeople may sound
like an oxymoron, but the National Automobile Dealers
Association plans just such a program to elevate the image of
the trade.
   If not for scandal-plagued television evangelists, "we'd
be on the bottom" in terms of public image, says Raymond
Green, the association's president. "I want it so that a
consumer looks forward to talking to a salesman." But the
goal is also to help dealers. Turnover in the 200,000 auto
sales jobs in the U.S. runs about 40% a year.
   This isn't the first attempt the industry has made to
improve the image of salespeople, but it may be the most
comprehensive. Besides sales techniques, salespeople will get
training in contract law, psychology, social studies and --
yes -- business ethics.
   Toyota Motor and Ford Motor are developing their own
certification programs. Ford will ask salespeople to
recertify every year, while the dealers association
anticipates recertification every three to five years.
                                                                                                       

   Crash-Test Data Have
   Scant Impact on Sales
                                                                                                       

   CONSUMERS IGNORE the federal government's automobile
crash-test results, a study finds.
   Researchers at Virginia Commonwealth concluded that, over
10 years, published reports of government crash tests have
virtually no effect on the sales of the models tested. In the
tests, the government crashes cars into walls at 35 miles an
hour and measures the damage to the dummies inside. Because
lighter cars hit the wall with less momentum, they tend to do
better than larger cars in the results. The trouble is,
bigger cars do better in real life, partly because they're
safer when colliding with smaller cars, insurance-company
studies show.
   The government gave the Ford Escort high marks for crash
survivability in 1987, though the Escort fares poorly in
insurance-company data. Similarly, the government's test in
1986 panned the Ford Taurus and its Mercury Sable twin,
though insurance data rate these cars among the safest. Sales
trends for these models didn't change.
   The federal National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
says its tests are only designed to compare cars in the same
size class, not to compare big ones with little ones.
   "We have never maintained that these tests would have a
large impact on market sales," says Jeffrey Miller, the
agency's deputy director. But they do provide an incentive
for manufacturers to improve, he says.

   Judge Acquits
   Rite Aid, Grass
   In Bribery Case

   Evidence Called Insufficient
   To Prosecute Charges
   Of Pressuring Regulator

   A judge in Cleveland, Ohio, threw out the bribery case
against Rite Aid Corp. and its president, Martin L. Grass,
saying evidence and testimony produced during two weeks of
trial were insufficient.
   After oral arguments yesterday morning and three hours of
deliberations, Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge
Lillian Greene ruled that evidence against Mr. Grass was
circumstantial and that the defense had supplied "a
reasonable theory of innocence."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In her ruling, Judge Greene in effect told prosecutors
that their case was too weak to send to a jury. She said
there was "no direct evidence to prove purpose" in the
prosecution's case.
   The verdict surprised prosecutors, who finished presenting
their case against Mr. Grass last week and were preparing for
his defense yesterday. Because the ruling amounts to an
acquittal, it can't be appealed.
   The ruling is likely to lift a cloud that has been hanging
over Rite Aid for more than a year. This week, a number of
Wall Street analysts said the company's stock has been
depressed by the trial. In composite trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange, Rite Aid shares closed at $37.50, up
$1.125.
   Alex Grass, chairman and chief executive officer of Rite
Aid, the largest drugstore chain in the country, expressed
satisfaction that his company and his son, Martin, have been
acquitted by the judge.
   Martin Grass, president and chief operating officer, was
arrested and charged with bribery in April 1989 after local
investigators videotaped him paying about $33,000 to Melvin
T. Wilczynski, a member of the Ohio Board of Pharmacy,
allegedly to obtain his resignation. The board licenses and
regulates the operations of drugstores in the state. Rite Aid
owns more than 250 stores in Ohio.
   Prosecutors maintained that the payment to Mr. Wilczynski,
as well as an offer of $34,000 in health insurance benefits
and the use of a Rite Aid car, were part of a scheme to pack
the pharmacy board in favor of Rite Aid.
   Investigators with the Cuyahoga County sheriff's office
videotaped Martin Grass while he met with Mr. Wilczynski in a
Cleveland airport hotel room. Martin Grass handed Mr.
Wilcyznski the check and six variously worded and undated
letters of resignation addressed to Ohio Gov. Richard
Celeste.
   According to the videotape, the two discussed the terms of
the resignation, and Mr. Wilczynski signed one of the
letters. Mr. Grass was heard saying that the resignation
would be delayed to avoid the appearance of impropriety.
   Rite Aid consistently denied any "wrongful intent" and
attacked Mr. Wilczynski's honesty during the trial. Mr.
Grass's attorney, George J. Moscarino, of the Cleveland firm
of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, maintained that the payment
was a legitimate buy-out of an existing contract that Mr.
Wilczynski had with Lane Drug Co., a company that Rite Aid
acquired in early 1989.
   Prosecutors suffered what legal experts viewed as a
serious setback during the trial. Judge Greene ruled
inadmissible the transcripts of several telephone
conversations between Messrs. Grass and Wilczynski that set
the stage for their videotaped meeting in Cleveland.
   According to the transcripts, Mr. Grass told Mr.
Wilczynski that Rite Aid had received a commitment from Gov.
Celeste's office to appoint a board member who would better
represent Rite Aid's interests.
   Gov. Celeste has denied making any such commitment.
   Defense lawyers cross-examining Mr. Wilczynski homed in on
his practice of billing both the pharmacy board and Lane Drug
for travel expenses. Mr. Wilczynski also did not report the
reimbursements by the state as income to the Internal Revenue
Service.
   Judge Greene limited her opinion to the state's burden of
proof, ruling that the state's own witnesses supplied a
"reasonable theory of innocence," meaning that the meeting in
the hotel room was for plausibly legitimate business reasons.
   "We had a civil negotiation going on, and that's what the
judge found," said Mr. Moscarino, Martin Grass's lawyer.
   Martin Grass, noting that he has a civil suit pending
against Mr. Wilczynski as a result of the charges, said he
was "set up" by investigators and Mr. Wilczynski but is
"pleased that we have been completely exonerated."

   GAF Corp. said it received a commitment letter from four
banks for $800 million of long-term senior financing to
refinance debt incurred in its 1989 management buy-out.
   The refinancing, by Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank of New
York, Bank of Nova Scotia and Banque Paribas, is expected to
close next month and will enable GAF to redeem $50 million
outstanding of senior subordinated increasing-rate notes due
March 15, 1994, the company said. The notes carry an interest
rate of 16.5%. Terms of the new bank financing are under
negotiation, a GAF spokeswoman said.

   The Wayne, N.J., maker of specialty chemicals and building
materials retired $235 million of the increasing-rate notes
this year as well as $200 million of senior debt after the
sale of its surfactant business to a limited partnership
headed by a unit of Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France.
   The agreement with the banks permits the company, after
the closing of the refinancing, to begin an exchange offer
for all or a portion of the company's subordinated merger
debentures, which public holders of GAF received in the 1989
buy-out and whose aggregate principal amount, together with
accrued interest, was $239 million as of June 30, GAF said.

   White House Warns of $100 Billion Cut
   In Spending if Budget Negotiations Fail

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, unable to cajole
Democrats in Congress into a deficit-reduction accord, tried
to scare them.
   If no agreement is reached at the budget summit talks,
across-the-board spending cuts of about $100 billion will be
triggered this fall, Budget Director Richard Darman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cuts of this "totally unprecedented size" would cripple
federal government's operations, Mr. Darman said. Although
the law exempts two-thirds of all spending, the other
one-third would be hit hard. Up to one million military
personnel could be let go. A million children could go
without vaccination. More than 100 air-traffic control towers
could be shut or their hours curtailed. The House Budget
Committee estimates that nearly 40% of all government
personnel outside the Pentagon could be laid off.
   The administration increased its estimate of the fiscal
1991 deficit an additional $10 billion from the figure it
gave budget negotiators last month. It now projects the
deficit at $168.8 billion -- not counting
greater-than-expected spending on the savings-and-loan
bailout. The target set by the Gramm-Rudman law is $64
billion.
   In January, the administration said the deficit would hit
$100.5 billion if Congress didn't act. By the time the
president convened the budget talks in May, the estimate had
been increased to between $138 billion and $148 billion. And
last month, Mr. Darman said the estimate had crept up to $159
billion. The increases reflect not only a slower economy and
higher interest rates, but substantially lower tax receipts
and greater spending than would have been anticipated given
the economy's current condition.
   When the administration's best guess of spending on the
thrift bailout is included, the deficit is now forecast to
hit $231.4 billion. The new White House numbers are within a
few billion dollars of the Congressional Budget Office's
estimates.
   Both Mr. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
insisted the administration won't agree to waive the spending
cuts unless the budget summit talks produce a broader
deficit-reduction compromise. House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) said he, too, would oppose such a
move. "That would be the biggest cop-out of all."
   But Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D.,
Tenn.) said it is "almost impossible for me to believe" that
the cuts would be left in place for an entire year.
   Mr. Darman sought to use new deficit projections for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 to push Congress toward
agreement. "The pressure is put on. It is inescapable," he
said. To heighten the pressure, Mr. Darman also released
details on the impact of across-the-board spending cuts, even
though the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law doesn't require
that report until Aug. 25.
   President Bush issued a statement saying the prospect of
such drastic cuts made it "all the more important that the
budget summit reach agreement promptly and Congress act
responsibly to bring the deficit down."
   The new administration report comes at a moment when the
budget talks appear to be stalled. The full negotiating teams
haven't met since Wednesday, although they may meet again
today. Administration officials met privately over the
weekend with key members of Congress and their staffs to talk
about, among other things, what taxes to increase.
   Staffers from the Treasury, House Ways and Means Committee
and Senate Finance Committee winnowed down a long array of
tax increases and tax breaks to what one House staff member
characterized as "a more manageable list." The aide said the
list, which was being prepared by the Treasury, would be used
by negotiators in deciding on a tax package. Another staffer
characterized the weekend discussions as "spade work." Among
the items on the list, described as "all-inclusive" by one
participant, are changes in income-tax rates and excise
taxes, and closing loopholes.
   Rep. Panetta said Democratic negotiators may be briefed on
those discussions as early as today. An underlying split
among Democrats was obvious as they responded to the new
administration estimates. Rep. Panetta spoke hopefully about
coming to an agreement in the next few weeks. Sen. Sasser
said that would be "exceedingly difficult." He complained
that "progress has been at a snail's pace" and blamed
President Bush for not talking more in public about the
severity of the deficit.
   Echoing Mr. Darman, Rep. Panetta said he hoped the new
figures would make Congress and the public appreciate the
magnitude of the deficit problem. "The bill for the '80s is
now coming due," he said. "These new numbers should hit the
White House, the Congress and the summit like a fire alarm in
the night."
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) told
reporters: "I'm glad the administration has acknowledged the
inaccuracy of their earlier estimates."
   Separately, Republican staffers say one matter likely to
be raised, either at a regular weekly meeting of Republican
leaders with the president or at a planned caucus of
Republican budget negotiators later in the day, is the uneasy
feeling among some Republicans that Mr. Darman may be
negotiating behind their backs with key Democrats.
   Mr. Brady dismissed demands from some Republicans that the
summit eschew all tax increases. "This is not a political
wrestling match," he said. "This is important to the American
people."
   Administration officials used the release of the figures
to underscore again their concern that the Federal Reserve
might not push interest rates down sufficiently to offset a
deficit-reduction accord. Mr. Brady stressed the importance
of "coordinated fiscal and monetary action." Michael Boskin,
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the Fed
should move "not only substantially, but quickly." The move
would have to be "a substantial multiple" of the
quarter-point reduction in short-term interest rates that the
Fed implemented last week.
   In a footnote to the new forecasts, the administration
said that what it termed "a normal recession" would add $33.7
billion to the federal deficit in fiscal 1991.
   It also disclosed that the deficit for the current year
now is projected at $161.3 billion if spending on the thrift
bailout is excluded and $218.5 billion if it's included. The
Gramm-Rudman law's deficit target for fiscal 1990 was $100
billion, but the law's deadline for imposing across-the-board
cuts for this year has already passed.

   For Scrutiny of Old Planes

   WASHINGTON -- The House voted for legislation that would
require more vigorous scrutiny of older jetliners to ensure
they are safe to fly.
   The bill, approved by voice vote, would require the
Federal Aviation Administration to inspect aging planes to
determine whether they are in compliance with maintenance
procedures mandated in recent years to guard against
cracking, metal fatigue and other age-related problems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The special FAA inspections would occur every four or five
years for planes 15 years or older. Proponents said the
stepped-up reviews are needed to ensure the safety of older
jetliners; 28% of the nation's jetliners are over 20 years
old, and that percentage will rise as planes are kept in
service longer than was originally planned.
   "Under the legislation, an inspection will be required in
which a straightforward question will be asked: `Is this old
airplane safe?'" said Rep. James Oberstar, (D., Minn.),
chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee. "Aircraft will
not be permitted to return to service until the answer is
`yes.'"
   The potential problems involving aging airliners was
illustrated in April 1988, when an Aloha Airlines plane lost
the top of its fuselage, killing a flight attendant. The
incident prompted the FAA and the airline industry to develop
more stringent policies for older aircraft.

   ISS International Service System Inc.'s directors accepted
a $12-a-share bid from ISS International Service System AS,
Copenhagen.
   ISS AS seeks to acquire the remaining 1.3 million shares,
or 36%, it doesn't already own of the New York-based
building-maintenance services company. An ISS International
Service System official said that the company hopes to have a
special stockholder meeting in September to act on the merger
agreement.

   General Development Corp. said it will probably have to
pay much larger claims than it originally thought for a
revised plea-bargain agreement to settle charges that it
defrauded thousands of home buyers.
   The developer, which is operating under federal bankruptcy
law protection, was dealt a blow last week when a federal
judge rejected its plea-bargain agreement with the U.S.
attorney in Miami. Under the restitution part of that
agreement, General Development would have had to pay home
buyers $80 million to $100 million over 25 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   General Development said the court gave the parties until
Aug. 7 to submit a revised plea agreement and restitution
plan. Failing that, the court will set a date to begin the
company's trial. The company, which said it has been
negotiating with the U.S. attorney, said it believes it will
be able to develop a plan by Aug. 7 that will satisfy the
court.
   However, General Development said, "It is likely that the
revised terms of the restitution plan would result in
substantially larger claims for restitution than originally
anticipated."

   The board of New Century Communications Inc., New
York-based parent of trade-magazine publisher Edgell
Communications Inc., approved in principle a plan to
restructure its $290 million of debt and $57 million of
preferred stock.
   New Century was formed through a December 1987 leveraged
buy-out of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s
business-publishing, trade-show production and
school-supplies distribution businesses. The buy-out was
executed by General Electric Co.'s investment-bank
subsidiary, Kidder, Peabody & Co.; members of Edgell's senior
management; and others.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Our objective is to be able to dedicate more operating
income to the company," a spokeswoman for New Century said.
The restructuring would cut and defer payments of interest
and principal.
   Advertising remains soft, but New Century's two other
divisions are performing well, the spokeswoman said. The
restructuring is subject to negotiations with lenders and
investors.
   New Century said its senior lenders -- which include GE's
financial-services arm, General Electric Capital Corp., and
seven banks -- have blocked it from making a $7 million
semiannual interest payment, due yesterday on its 14% senior
subordinated debentures, for as long as 120 days.

   Oil Prices Continue to Climb Along With Hopes
   That OPEC Has a Grip on Production Problem

   Oil prices continued a week-old run-up as more bullish
news came out of OPEC.
   In U.S. futures trading, the price of crude oil for August
delivery rose 31 cents to $18.67 a barrel. September crude
settled 50 cents higher at $19.85 a barrel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, which had
set a new trading record of more than 50,000 contracts only
last Friday, gasoil (heating oil) contracts surged while
North Sea Brent crude for August was up 41 cents a barrel to
$17.84.
   But U.S. fuel futures set the pace as expectations mounted
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
come to grips with its overproduction problem. On the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the price of unleaded gasoline for
August delivery surged 2.49 cents to settle at 64.44 cents a
gallon. The September contract was up the limit of two cents
a gallon.
   Among yesterday's OPEC developments: The Iranian oil
minister arrived in Tripoli, where he visited the Libyan oil
minister in his whirlwind campaign to gain support for an
increase of $2 a barrel to $20 in the OPEC reference price;
the national oil company of Abu Dhabi, chief emirate of the
United Arab Emirates, told its crude buyers that it intends
to reduce production some 400,000 barrels a day in August;
and Kuwait reported a halt in spot sales, adding that it may
have to buy crude from others for its refineries.
   The Emirates and Kuwait, two chronic violators of OPEC
quotas, had pledged to reduce their production to 1.5 million
barrels a day each under terms of last week's proposal by
Persian Gulf oil exporters. The proposal, to be put before
all 13 oil ministers at the OPEC meetings beginning in Geneva
next week, is intended to lift petroleum prices by curbing
runaway production. It has improved prospects that all the
oil ministers will swiftly agree to freeze the OPEC output
ceiling near 22.1 million barrels a day.
   As previously reported, leading Persian Gulf producers,
including Kuwait, the Emirates and Saudi Arabia, are willing
to hold their output down now in a trade-off for larger OPEC
shares later. And Kuwait confirmed yesterday that at last
week's meeting of the five oil ministers in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, it was promised a higher production quota for the
fourth quarter.
   Rashid Salem Al-Ameeri, the new Kuwaiti oil minister, was
quoted by that country's news agency as saying, "The Jeddah
agreement affirmed the commitment to quotas and included
support for Kuwait to increase its oil production quota. This
would take effect during the fourth quarter of the current
year, after oil prices are brought back under control and the
current glut on world oil markets has been absorbed."
   So long as the OPEC news continues bullish, analysts said
other factors aren't having much effect on oil markets. The
American Petroleum Institute's latest weekly report on U.S.
oil inventories, which is due out today after futures trading
ends, is likely to influence the markets. But analysts
generally expect the institute to report another decline in
U.S. crude oil inventories.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of several hog futures
contracts rose their maximum daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound
amid a sudden tightening in the supply of hogs ready for
slaughter. Livestock analysts weren't aware of any specific
reason for the sudden shortage of mature hogs. But the hog
market is so volatile this year that a blip in supplies can
cause a wide price swing. In trading yesterday the price of
the hog contract for July delivery settled at 62.77 cents a
pound, up 1.5 cents. In the spring, hog prices soared to
record highs because farmers had been reducing the size of
their herds. In June, hog prices slipped as consumers began
resisting the high price of pork in the supermarket. So far
this month, hog prices have been swinging back and forth on
mixed signals. Supermarket demand is still weak. Yet
meatpackers sometimes have to bid up prices in order to keep
their plants supplied with enough hogs to keep operating. Hog
prices may get another boost Friday. Some analysts expect the
Agriculture Department to report that roughly twice the
normal rate of pork bellies was pulled out of frozen storage
in June, a reflection of the tight supply of hogs ready for
slaughter. Pork bellies are sliced into bacon. Also on
Friday, the government is expected to report that the fewest
young cattle in 15 years were placed onto feedlots in the
second quarter. Among other things, the small number reflects
the fact that an unusually wet spring improved the condition
of pastures. Through the winter, many ranchers were forced to
move their cattle to feedlots because dry weather had damaged
their grazing lands. Feedlots rapidly fatten cattle for
slaughter. Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst at Shearson
Lehman Hutton, Chicago, said he expects the Agriculture
Department's 13-state survey to find that 5.1 million cattle
were placed on feedlots in the second quarter, down 2% from a
year earlier.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices at first extended Friday's
declines, but they recovered in late trading to recoup most
of the day's losses. The September contract ended at $1.22 a
pound for a decline of 0.95 cent. Prices on Friday fell
following gains of almost 20 cents a pound over two weeks on
production problems and concerns over supplies. As the
selling continued yesterday, the September price dropped as
low as $1.2060. According to one analyst, "Traders were
looking for a reason to sell and they found one,"
specifically news that workers at the Minero mine in Peru had
called off the strike scheduled to start yesterday. "The
potential strike in itself wasn't really very significant,
but since traders wanted an excuse, the impact of its
cancellation was magnified," he said. Late in the day, Reuter
reported an earthquake had struck in Chile. It wasn't known
if it had any effect on copper production, but it triggered
buying in futures that helped prices recover, analysts said.
Chile is the world's biggest copper producer. An earthquake
also struck in the Philippines; the amount of damage wasn't
immediately known. The Philippines is a medium-sized producer
of about 190,000 tons annually.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased. August delivery
gold was off $1.20 an ounce to $364.50. September silver
declined 6.2 cents an ounce to $4.9030. October platinum fell
$5 an ounce to $481.80. A stronger dollar contributed to the
setback in gold, which didn't follow through on strong
advances Thursday and Friday. Gold rose Thursday because
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated the central
bank was ready to ease monetary policy, and then on Friday
the bank cut a key rate by about 1/4 percentage point to
about 8%. However, Sharon Zimian, vice president of Citibank,
New York, observed that there was sufficient demand for gold
contracts to stem the decline. "Gold behaved quite well," she
said, despite the fact that "the surge in the stock market to
a record level surely must have drawn funds from the precious
metals." Another element that might have minimized the drop
was that traders were awaiting the issuance today of reports
on the trade deficit, industrial production and capacity
utilization, she said. The setback in platinum was mostly
profit-taking following Friday's sharp gains, said Nina
Lipton, research manager for Platinum Guild International, an
industry group.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Golf on the Old Course, Where It All Began

<LP>
   St. Andrews, Scotland -- At one time, what's now called
the Old Course here comprised 22 holes, but in 1764 its first
four holes were combined into two longer ones, and the same
was done with the final four. So great was to become the
prestige of St. Andrews that the resulting 18 holes is now
the standard size of golf courses everywhere. The
consolidation was to prove fortunate, for if the course had
stayed at 22 holes, many physicians would be too tired to see
their patients on Thursday mornings.
   History permeates the sod of St. Andrews, where the 119th
British Open will be contested beginning Thursday. It is,
uncontestedly, golf's birthplace, dating from at least the
15th century and, possibly, much further back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   No golf artifacts survive from those earliest days, but an
act of the Scottish Parliament, dated March 1457, stated that
"the Fute-ball and Golfe be utterly cryit doune, and not
usit" -- which, I guess, expressed disapproval. The populace
must have paid little heed, because in 1491 another act
ordained that "in no place of the realm there be usit
Fute-ball, Golfe or uther unprofitabill sportis."
   By the 1500s, Parliament had given up on such
unprofitabill strictures, possibly because the king, James
IV, was deeply into the game. So, later in the century, were
James V and his daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary was such
a golf nut that she was spied on the St. Andrews links a few
days after the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley. It's not
recorded whether the unpleasantness affected her score.
   Moving right along, we come to 1754, when 22 "noblemen and
gentlemen" of this gray-stone town across the Firth of Forth
from Edinburgh formed the Society of St. Andrews Golfers.
That later would become the Royal and Ancient Golf Club
(R&amp;A), which promulgates golf's rules everywhere but in the
U.S.
   Among the society's first set of 13 rules was No. 11,
which read: "If a Ball be stop'd by any person, Horse, Dog,
or anything else, the Ball so stop'd must be played where it
lies." This is why golfers must wait until no one is looking
before kicking their balls out of the rough.
   The rule probably was first violated at St. Andrews,
because the place is rife with golfing trouble. To an eye
accustomed to the lush greenery of American layouts, the Old
Course, set on sandy, undulating seaside land, looks more
like a poorly tended farm than a place to play golf, its
dominant color the yellow-brown of the high, fairway-hugging
grasses that sway in the wind. Herbert Warren Wind, in a
wonderful article on the place, called it a "tawny sea of
billows."
   One wonders why the Scots put so many of their golf
courses in such places in an otherwise beautiful land --
until it starts to rain, and the water disappears into the
sandy soil. If they didn't play golf in the rain in Scotland,
they'd never play at all.
   But beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and St. Andrews
grows on many. "The more you study it, the more you love it,
and the more you love it, the more you study it," said the
great Bobby Jones, who won the British Open on the course in
1927, and the British Amateur here three years later.
   Mark Calcavecchia, who won last year's Open title at Royal
Troon and is here to defend it, expressed a similar view
during last month's U.S. Open in Medinah, Ill. "Once you've
played St. Andrews a few times, like I have, its variety
starts to sink in," he said. "There are holes you can play
five or six different ways."
   The course that will test the world's best this week is
one of four owned by the municipality of St. Andrews. All are
available for public use except for tournaments and the few
weeks that the R&amp;A expropriates them. The Old Course has been
altered little over the past 150 years except for length. To
compensate for the game's technological improvements, it now
measures 6,933 yards.
   That the Old Course has kept pace is well attested. In the
past seven Opens staged here -- in 1955, '57, '60, '64, '70,
'78 and '84 -- first place was attained by 72-hole scores in
the narrow range of 276 to 283 strokes, with the wind, or
occasional lack of it, usually being the determining factor.
"You can't discuss St. Andrews without talking about the
wind," '70 champ Jack Nicklaus has declared.
   Individual holes at the course are the stuff of
picturesque dentist-office prints, but two stand out. One is
the 14th, a 567-yard par five that exemplifies the Old
Course's treachery and its stewards' proclivity for the
whimsical. From an elevated tee overlooking a ravine, the
golfer faces what Nicklaus calls "the most dangerous drive in
the world when the wind is blowing."
   Ten bunkers, including ones named "Hell" and "The
Beardies," line a fairway called "Elysian Fields." Beyond
that stands a huge, rolling double green, one of seven on the
premises. Gene Sarazen caught "Hell" on 14 during the 1933
Open here, took two shots to get out, and got an eight on the
hole. He lost the tourney by a stroke.
   The 17th, the "Road Hole," probably is golf's most famous.
It's a 461-yard par four dogleg right, with a road lined by a
stone wall tracing its right edge. Some players try to cut
the dogleg by flying the wall, but then must hit a
middle-to-long iron into a trapped, narrow, terraced green
that Bobby Jones said was "capable of deflecting a second
shot in bewildering directions." Many elect to play short and
chip on to avoid such difficulties.
   After a career in which he won 13 titles in the "Grand
Slam" of his day (the U.S. and British opens and amateur
championships), Jones called his 1930 British Amateur win
here his most memorable, and a third-round match in which he
defeated Cyril Tolley in 19 holes the best of that tourney.
In his book "Golf Is My Game," Jones rhapsodized that
Tolley's third shot on 17, a pitch over a bunker to two feet
of the cup, was a shot that "never has been surpassed for
exquisitely beautiful execution."
   Jones, who regularly scored much lower, had a 75 that day.
But it was on the Old Course. And the wind was blowing.

   Avoid Surgery
   In Breast Cancer

   French researchers reported promising results from a
10-year study in which they treated breast cancer without
surgery.
   In an effort to preserve the breast, the researchers used
intense chemotherapy and radiation as the primary treatment
of 250 women in the various stages of breast cancer. The
anti-cancer drugs and radiation caused the breast tumor to
disappear initially in all the patients, though 79 patients
subsequently suffered relapses of their cancer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The French report highlights a new development in cancer
research, the attempt to replace surgery with chemotherapy
and radiation in several kinds of cancer, said Vincent De
Vita, former head of the National Cancer Institute and now
physician-in-chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
in New York.
   In the July issue of Cancer, a journal published by the
American Cancer Society, the French physicians said their
latest analysis shows that all the women whose cancers were
caught in the earliest stage, when the tumors were still
small, are expected to be alive without any trace of cancer
five years after treatment.
   For women diagnosed and treated in the more advanced
stages of breast cancer, the expected five-year, disease-free
survival rates range from 82% in women with moderate-sized
breast tumors or cancers that had begun to spread to nearby
lymph nodes to 52% for women with large tumors and spread of
the cancer to distant lymph nodes.
   U.S. cancer specialists cautioned that the French
researchers didn't have a "control" group of patients who had
received the standard treatment of surgery followed by
chemotherapy. Therefore, they noted, it's impossible to tell
whether the nonsurgical treatment is any better than standard
breast cancer therapy.
   The new report, by cancer specialist Claude Jacquillat and
his colleagues at Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, shows that
it's possible to treat successfully at least some breast
cancers without surgery, the U.S. scientists said.
   "It shows conclusively that it is a doable kind of thing"
to treat breast cancer without surgery, said Bernard Fisher,
the University of Pittsburgh cancer specialist who has headed
several federally funded studies of breast cancer therapies.
The main unanswered question is whether the nonsurgical
treatment is as effective in the long term as the standard
surgery followed by chemotherapy, he said.
   An attempt to determine the new treatment's efficacy with
a "controlled" study is now under way at several
collaborating cancer centers in the U.S., Dr. Fisher said.
Half of the women volunteering for the study will receive
chemotherapy and radiation. They'll undergo surgery only if
the tumor isn't eradicated. The other half will receive the
standard surgery first followed by chemotherapy. So far,
about 600 women had been treated in the large-scale
experiment, about half the number that researchers hope to
enlist for the study.
   Dr. De Vita added that "we're trying to do the same thing
here {at Memorial Sloan-Kettering} with head-and-neck
cancer." By replacing surgery with chemotherapy and
radiation, doctors hope to preserve such patient's vocal
cords, he explained. "At this point, the results look about
as good as radical surgery" in head-and-neck cancer patients,
he said.
   "The whole field is new and very exciting, although like
most new fields, it has its troublesome aspects," Dr. De Vita
added. An ethical problem surrounds both the breast and neck
cancer studies in that researchers are asking patients to try
a new, unproven treatment when a treatment of proven
effectiveness is available. This is different from most
cancer research in which new, unproven treatments are used
only in patients who are beyond the help of any therapy.
   The French experiment extends recent efforts to get away
from a century-long practice in which the total removal of
the breast and much of the muscle underneath was deemed the
only treatment capable of curing breast cancer. In the past
decade, after years of controversy, less radical and
disfiguring surgery has been found to be as effective as the
radical mastectomy in curing the disease. Today, many women
whose breast tumors are only an inch in diameter or smaller
are treated solely by removal of the tumor -- a lumpectomy --
followed by radiation therapy, a procedure that preserves the
breast.
   The French attempt to do away with surgery altogether is
an outgrowth of research by Gabriel Hortobagyi, an oncologist
at the University of Texas' M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston, noted the Medical Tribune, a newspaper for
physicians that first reported the French results. In the
1970s, Dr. Hortobagyi began using intense chemotherapy in
patients with very advanced breast cancer and found that in
about 15% of the patients, the tumors disappeared completely.
Dr. Hortobagyi said that in the last three to four years, he
has been using chemotherapy to reduce tumor size in patients
with earlier stages of breast cancer, making them eligible
for breast-preserving lumpectomy.
   In their report, Dr. Jacquillat and his colleagues said
chemotherapy alone caused breast tumors to shrink by more
than half in three-quarters of the women. In 74 of the 250
patients, the tumors disappeared completely after
chemotherapy alone. In all the remaining patients, the breast
tumors were eradicated by radiation following chemotherapy.
   The cosmetic results were "excellent" in 164 of the
patients, with treated and untreated breasts appearing
identical, the researchers reported. In 55 patients, the
cosmetic results were "good;" the treated breast appeared
normal, but slightly smaller, and there was evidence of
fibrous tissue developing from the radiation treatments. The
remaining 31 patients had "fair" results in which the treated
breast showed obvious differences from the untreated breast.
   The key question surrounding the study, as in most breast
cancer research, is whether the chemotherapy and radiation
wiped out not only the main tumor but any cancer cells that
had broken loose and had spread to other parts of the body,
the so-called metastases.
   As of the middle of last year, 72 patients had had
relapses of their cancers, 11 of whom underwent mastectomies
and six of whom had lumpectomies, the French researchers
said. The recurring cancers in the remaining 55 patients
weren't treatable with surgery. Forty-six of the women have
died because their cancers had spread to other parts of the
body, and six have died of causes other than breast cancer.

   CHICAGO -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded about $700
million in debt issued by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit,
citing unsettled labor disputes and burdensome leases.
   S&amp;P said the United ratings remain on its CreditWatch list
"with negative implications," pending the airline company's
possible acquisition by its employees. UAL declined to
comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rating concern cut its ratings on $200 million of
industrial revenue bonds to triple-B-minus from triple-B, and
on $500 million of subordinated debt to double-B-plus from
triple-B-minus. It cited "erosion that has already occurred"
in the airline's credit, and said the ratings could be
lowered further after a buy-out or financial restructuring.
   United's contracts with its three major unions have
expired and are in negotiation or mediation; progress isn't
likely until the airline's future ownership is resolved, S&amp;P
said. Failure to complete the buy-out would leave unhappy
employees reluctant to agree to productivity and work-rule
concessions sought by management, it said.
   Completion of the buy-out would improve the labor
situation but add substantial debt to the balance sheet, S&amp;P
said. United's total debt was about $1.7 billion at March 31,
lower than prior levels, S&amp;P said, but the "debt equivalent
of United's off-balance-sheet leases has mounted rapidly to
approximately $5 billion, and will rise further as new
aircraft needed for fleet expansion and modernization are
delivered." It said the new equipment will lower operating
costs and facilitate growth, but raise fixed financial
obligations significantly.

   Dean Foods to Post
   Lower Per-Share Profit
   For Its Fourth Quarter

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)
</IN>
<LP>
   CHICAGO -- Dean Foods Co. expects to report per-share
earnings for its fourth quarter, ended May 31, of about 75
cents to 80 cents a share, its chairman and chief executive
officer, Howard M. Dean, said.
   While that represents a decline of about 5% to 10% from a
year earlier, the executive said in an interview that he was
pleased with the results, "because it's been a tough year for
us."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the lower per-share earnings, he said, operating
earnings rose 19% to 27% for the quarter.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the food and dairy concern
earned $22.2 million, or 84 cents a share, helped by a $5.4
million, or 21 cent-a-share, gain from the sale of its
Baskin-Robbins ice cream business.
   Sales for the latest quarter were up from $437.6 million a
year earlier, Mr. Dean said, but he wouldn't be specific.
   Mr. Dean said the company's specialty food products
operation is having a good year, but he credited most of the
quarter's upturn in operating earnings to "improved dairy
earnings and acquisitions."
   He said the three acquisitions the company made over the
past year, of Cates Pickle Co., Bellingham Frozen Foods and
Mayfield Dairy Farms, all helped boost operating earnings in
the fourth quarter.
   For fiscal 1990, Mr. Dean expects the company to earn
between $2.25 and $2.30 a share, with sales "just short of $2
billion." This compares with earnings in fiscal 1989 of $60.4
million, or $2.28 a share, on sales of $1.68 billion.
   Mr. Dean said the company's directors will be considering
increasing the quarterly dividend on its common at their
meeting next week. Dean Foods currently pays 16.5 cents a
share quarterly.

   Lafarge Coppee S.A. said it will take full control of VEB
Karsdorf of East Germany, in a move that will make the French
cement and building materials concern Europe's leading cement
producer.
   The purchase price wasn't disclosed, but Lafarge Coppee
Chairman Bertrand Collomb said it was less than the
investment of between one billion and two billion francs
($180.7 million and $361.3 million) that will be required to
modernize the East German cement company's installations and
bring them up to Western productivity standards in the coming
years.

   Lafarge Coppee signed a preliminary agreement for the
Karsdorf takeover in June. Karsdorf's assets are still being
audited, and completing all financial details could take

has already injected 50 million marks ($30.3 million) into
Karsdorf in the form of working capital. The acquisition will
be carried out through Lafarge Coppee's West German unit,
Wossinger Zement G.m.b.H.

   FCC Makes Surprise Audit

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
auditors for the first time conducted surprise visits to 30
radio and television stations, checking for compliance with
political-advertising rules.
   The agency expects to issue a report this summer after it
obtains information from the stations on their advertising
rates. After a similar spot audit of telephone operator
services in April, the FCC last month proposed more stringent
rules for that industry. Both audits were launched because
the agency suspected lax compliance with its rules.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The FCC targeted four television and two radio stations in
each of five metropolitan areas: Cincinnati, Dallas-Fort
Worth, Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., and San Francisco. The
cities were chosen because they are spread across the country
and because stations in some of the markets serve two or
three states.
   Auditors checked each station's political file for the
1990 elections as well as advertising-rate data to ensure
compliance with political-programming rules. The rules
require stations to provide equal opportunity for all
candidates, so that if one candidate runs an ad, opponents
can buy the same amount of air time at the same time of day.
Other rules require stations to sell political advertising at
their lowest rates and to maintain a file of political
programming that is available to the public.
   The 30 stations have 20 days to answer FCC questions about
rates, supplying data on commercial and political
advertising.

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp. said it
plans to move its headquarters from a building it leases here
to a company-owned building in Seal Beach, Calif.
   A spokesman said Rockwell is making the move because "we
believe the working environment in Seal Beach is more
suitable for a major corporate headquarters."

<TEXT>
   The electronics and aerospace concern said it expects to
complete the move in January 1992. The move will affect 235
of Rockwell's 34,000 employees in Southern California.
Rockwell said its North American Aircraft unit, with 3,800
employees, will remain in El Segundo.
   Rockwell Chairman Donald R. Beall lives in Corona del Mar,
which is much closer to Seal Beach than to El Segundo.
"Needless to say, that isn't the reason for the move," the
spokesman said.
   He said that Rockwell plans to upgrade its building in
Seal Beach but that he couldn't provide an estimated cost of
these changes. He also said the company hasn't quantified any
possible cost savings from moving to the company-owned
building from the leased building.

   MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union dropped its objections to a
united Germany being a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The decision, announced by President Mikhail Gorbachev
after two days of talks with West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, removes the last major hurdle to German unity. Mr.
Gorbachev told a news conference that it was the right of a
sovereign Germany to choose which military alliance it
belonged to.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Whether we like it or not the time will come when a
united Germany will be in NATO if that is its choice," Mr.
Gorbachev said. "Then, if that is the choice, to some degree
and in some form it can work together with the Soviet Union."
   President Bush, in a statement released by the White
House, hailed Gorbachev's remark, saying: "This comment
demonstrates statesmanship, and strengthens efforts to build
enduring relationships based on cooperation."
   In return for Mr. Gorbachev's concession, Mr. Kohl pledged
that a united Germany will reduce the size of its army about
40% to 370,000 men and negotiate a treaty with the Soviets on
troop withdrawals. The Soviets would be given three to four
years to withdraw their 380,000 troops from East German
territory, during which time no non-German NATO troops would
be based in East Germany. A united Germany also would
renounce chemical weapons and join the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
   The two sides agreed to work on a second treaty on
economic, political and broader elements of the bilateral
relationship, to replace separate existing Soviet treaties
with East and West Germany.
   The two leaders also discussed how West German economic
aid could help save the Soviet economy. A reunited Germany
will be the Soviet Union's biggest trading partner by a wide
margin.
   In their televised news conference, Mr. Gorbachev said the
agreement was a compromise. "Politics is the art of the
possible," he said. "In absolute terms, the West German side
didn't get what it was counting on. In absolute terms, we in
our turn did not get what we had been counting on. But we
were realists."
   After months of resisting the idea of a united Germany in
NATO, the Soviet Union finally bowed to the inevitable.
Western nations all insist that a united Germany be anchored
in the Western alliance -- a position Mr. Kohl strongly
supports.
   Mr. Gorbachev's change of heart was helped by several
factors. He has just weathered a crucial Soviet Communist
Party Congress, in which he stifled harsh criticism of his
foreign policy and emerged with broad endorsement for
continuing his policies. He also removed some of the toughest
hard-liners who opposed German unity from the leadership,
putting the party on a more moderate course.
   Mr. Kohl sweetened the pill by agreeing to set a ceiling
on future German troop strength, before final figures are
determined at conventional arms reduction talks now taking
place in Vienna.
   Soviet television showed scenes of the meetings at the
southern Russian spa town of Mineralnye Vody. It was the
first time Mr. Gorbachev had invited a Western leader to
talks outside of Moscow and he appeared very relaxed. In an
open-necked shirt and sweater, Mr. Gorbachev was shown
walking through the woods, laughing and joking with Mr. Kohl.
   TV pictures helped promote the image of a newly friendly
partnership. Most striking were the numerous Soviet veterans
of World War II waving tiny West German flags and welcoming
Mr. Kohl.
   This depiction is an abrupt turnaround for state-run
television. For decades, war movies have been popular fare in
the Soviet Union and the German threat has been a staple of
Soviet propaganda. At least 20 million Soviets died in World
War II.
   Now, Mr. Gorbachev must shift public attention from that
bitter history to the generations of cooperation that have
also been part of the two countries' relations. A central
factor in the new relationship will be a united Germany's
ability to help Mr. Gorbachev's attempts to turn the Soviet
Union into a market-based economy.
   A senior West German official said before the meeting that
Mr. Kohl would assure Mr. Gorbachev that Bonn plans to be his
economic partner, active in providing credits and technical
know-how. West Germany has already given $3 billion in
credits to the Soviet Union.
   The official said a new aid package would include
assistance in establishing a transport system and management
training, two areas that Soviet economists and foreign
businessmen say are essential before any economic reform can
get off the ground. West Germany also would buy more oil and
natural gas from the Soviets, the proceeds from which Moscow
could use to finance the expanded relationship.
   Economists in the Soviet Union have long been split into
two camps -- those who see the U.S. as their best potential
partner and those who believe the rosiest future lies in
close ties with a united Germany. Since Mr. Kohl visited
Moscow in 1988, West Germany has increasingly been viewed as
a good model.
   East Germany is already the Soviet Union's biggest trading
partner in the East Bloc, as West Germany is in the West.
Each one accounts for about 10% of the Soviet Union's total
trade.

   NEW YORK -- The dollar was narrowly mixed in active
trading as dealers sought to lock in gains on minor price
changes and scrambled to establish positions ahead of today's
U.S. trade report.
   Traders said the dollar fluctuations reflected neither
underlying economics nor news developments. "There was no
good reason to do anything to the dollar," said David Wilson,
a New York vice president for Girozentrale Vienna.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The day's one consistent mover was the Swiss franc, which
declined against all major currencies on weekend rumors that
the Swiss National Bank is poised to ease monetary policy. A
spokesman said yesterday the central bank has no such
intention.
   The Swiss base interest rate was set at 10.75% yesterday,
a quarter of a percentage point below its level Friday.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6547 marks, up from 1.6510 marks late Friday in New York.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar was unchanged at
148.15 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.8040, above $1.8005
late Friday.
   The dollar climbed to 1.4180 Swiss francs from 1.4025
francs late Friday. The mark was last quoted at 0.8570 Swiss
franc, up from 0.8495 franc Friday. Sterling rose to 2.5581
Swiss francs from 2.5252 francs Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was trading
at 147.93 yen, down from Monday's Tokyo close of 148.43 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6590 marks, up
from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.6577 marks.
   The U.S. trade report could make for hectic North American
currency dealings this morning, said David Ogg, chief New
York dealer for Credit Suisse.
   The nation's trade deficit is estimated to have widened in
May to $7.7 billion from $6.94 billion in April.
   Initially, the dollar will be bought if the U.S.'s deficit
is smaller than expected and sold if that figure is larger
than anticipated. But the overall figure can be overshadowed
by movements in regional trade accounts or by volume changes
in either exports or imports.
   Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover
Trust, said, "The dollar is undervalued against the European
currencies with which we have a trade surplus but overvalued
against Asian currencies with which we have a trade deficit."
   In April, the U.S. had a $1.36 billion surplus with
Western Europe. Its deficit with Japan was $3.95 billion.
   If today's figures disclose a continuance of that trend,
Mr. Kellner said, the U.S. currency will probably be sold
against Asian currencies, with the yen as an immediate proxy.
If the U.S.'s trade deficit with Asia was smaller in May than
April, the dollar should climb today.
   The greenback has less room to move against European
currencies, Mr. Kellner said, because investors currently are
focusing more on the small interest-rate differentials
between the U.S. and Europe than on trade.
   Mr. Kellner said he will also be looking for a continued
slowdown in export growth to confirm the weakness of the U.S.
economy. Some European foreign exchange dealers said they
will look at import growth for a signal of inflationary
pressures.
   June U.S. industrial production and capacity utilization
figures, also due today, will further gauge U.S. economic
expansion.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $363.30 an ounce, down $1.10. Estimated
volume was a light 2.3 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$361.75 an ounce.

Maxicare said it expects the new securities to be traded in
the over-the-counter market.
   Maxicare was once the nation's largest publicly traded
health maintenance organization with more than two million
members in 26 states. After its huge debt payments exceeded
its revenue, Maxicare was forced to close or sell many of its
health plans and lost many of its members. Maxicare now has
about 300,000 members in seven states.

   NEW YORK -- To help spread the risks of developing new
television shows, King World Productions Inc. announced a
public offering for an outside programming fund, Merlin
Program Capital Inc.
   King World said it filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to raise $36 million in an offering of 2,250,000
units at $16 each. Each unit includes one share of Merlin
common stock and one warrant to purchase a common share of
King World between March 1, 1992, and August 31, 1995. The
exercise price for the warrants hasn't been set yet.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Production and development costs for new shows will be
split 50-50 between King World and Merlin, the company said,
and each will share equally in net receipts, but only after
payment of distribution fees to King World.
   Much like Walt Disney Co.'s Silver Screen partnerships,
King World's Merlin Program lays off some of the high risk of
developing new entertainment on outside investors. Like movie
partnerships, the investment is risky, however, and it
remains to be seen if investors will find syndicated
television shows as attractive an investment as movies. "I
wouldn't put any widows and orphans into this one," said one
Wall Street analyst.
   The $36 million production fund is a blind fund that could
go into future shows of any sort, King World said, but to
start with, the Merlin money will help support two shows in
the works. One is "Only Yesterday," a weekday magazine-style
show is set to premiere this fall. The other is a series
based on the old "Candid Camera" show, which is still being
developed. King World said it has already spent about $2
million developing "Only Yesterday," and half that amount
will immediately be paid by Merlin after the closing of the
offering.
   King World has been highly successful as a syndicator of
television shows produced by others, including the hits
"Jeopardy]" and "The Oprah Winfrey Show," but its track
record as a producer is too new to evaluate. One of its first
efforts, the syndicated tabloid show "Inside Edition" has
survived several seasons, though its ratings are modest.
   And the current business climate is tougher now. As King
World said in the prospectus for the offering, "television
stations licensing programming for the 1990-1991 season are
generally less willing than they were in prior seasons to
acquire new programs."
   When the offering is completed, King World said it will
own 1.5 million shares of Merlin preferred stock, which is
convertible into 40% of Merlin's common stock on a fully
diluted basis. King World said it will have the option to
purchase the Merlin shares being issued in the offering for a
four-year period beginning Aug. 1, 1993, but that option can
be exercised only if it purchases all the shares.

   Alcoa of Australia Ltd., an alumina and aluminum company,
reported that first-half operating profit after taxes rose
5.2% to 395.9 million Australian dollars (US$308.5 million)
from A$376.2 million a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue rose 7.6% to A$1.5 billion from A$1.4 billion.
   The company said profit improved mainly because of higher
alumina shipments, favorable gold mining operations, a weaker
Australian currency and higher interest income from
short-term investments. These improvements were partly offset
by lower aluminum prices and higher raw materials costs.
   Alcoa is one of Australia's largest exporters; it said it
accounts for more than 5% of the country's merchandise
exports.
   The outlook for the rest of this year looks sound, despite
some slowing in the U.S. economy, the company said. But Alcoa
warned that if the Australian dollar remains at its current
level, second-half earnings will be lower.

   Tomkins PLC of Britain said pretax profit for the year
ended April 28 rose 18% to #77 million ($138.8 million) from
#65.1 million a year earlier, helped by the industrial
management concern's low exposure to the depressed British
economy.
   The results were at the top end of market expectations,
which were for a rise of between #75 million and #77.5
million, and were in line with the company's forecast of "no
less than" #76 million.

   Profit attributable to shareholders, after taxes, rose 22%

   Sales rose 30% to #720 million from #550 million.
   Tomkins said it is proposing to pay a final dividend of
6.55 pence a share, which, together with its interim payment
of 2.70 pence, would make the full-year payout 9.25 pence, up
37% from 6.75 pence last year.

   HOUSTON -- A First City Bancorp. of Texas shareholder
filed suit in federal court here charging the bank holding
company and others with misleading investors about the health
of its loan portfolio.
   The lawsuit, filed by Jerry Krim of Arlington, Va.,
alleges that First City, several officers and directors, and
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., the company's
investment banker, made excessively optimistic statements
about First City's prospects in proxy materials issued in
connection with a federally assisted bailout of the company
in 1988, as well as in subsequent annual reports. Donaldson
Lufkin is a unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The complaint accuses the new management team of A. Robert
Abboud, chairman and chief executive officer, of failing to
disclose "the true extent to which (First City's) loan
portfolio was composed of high-risk loans to debt-laden
companies who were having difficulties meeting cashflow
projections."
   In recent months several such loans have been placed on
nonperforming status, contributing to what First City says
will be a decline in second-quarter earnings.
   The plaintiff, who is seeking to have the lawsuit granted
class-action status, requests unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages.
   Neither First City nor DLJ would comment on the complaint.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, First City shares closed at $21.25, down $1.75.

   WASHINGTON -- A Pittsburgh laboratory performed faulty

approval, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
   An FDA review of tests performed by Biodecision
Laboratories on 13 generic-drug products made by other
companies found that 11 were of questionable validity. Among
the problems cited were insufficient documentation and
inadequate training of laboratory personnel. The test results
had been submitted to the FDA as part of the drug-approval
process.

   Robert Lesher, Biodecision president, said the lab had
already reviewed 12 of the 13 tests cited by the FDA and
found that "in every case, the original conclusion remains
intact." The FDA plans to examine the drugs before
determining whether they should remain on the market, a
spokesman said.
   Although Mr. Lesher wouldn't disclose the companies or
drugs involved for reasons of confidentiality, he said that
since the company's founding in 1971, "we've done work for
every major generic drug company." The FDA evaluation
reviewed tests performed by the lab since that time.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. tightened its grip on Canada's
hottest gold prospect by agreeing to raise its stake in one
of the companies that owns the deposit. The move appears to
give Corona greater leverage in proposed talks with rival
Placer Dome Inc. over ownership of the property.
   Under the agreement, Corona said it will acquire 5.6
million shares in Prime Resources Group Inc., increasing its
voting control in the Vancouver, British Columbia-based
exploration outfit to 44% from about 34%. The shares are to
be acquired from several major shareholders, including Prime
Resources Chairman Murray Pezim, a director and honorary
chairman of Corona.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Acquiring the shares "strengthens {Corona} without a
doubt. They are almost at effective control" of Prime
Resources, said Stephen Semeniuk, an analyst at L.O.M.
Western Securities Ltd. in Vancouver.
   Corona also owns 45% of Stikine Resources Ltd., Prime
Resources' partner in the Eskay Creek gold property, in
northwestern British Columbia. The property has estimated
reserves of about 4.8 million ounces, valued at U.S.$1.74
billion at current market prices.
   Stikine also is 45%-owned by Vancouver-based Placer Dome,
which bid for all of Stikine's shares in an attempt to head
off Corona's moves to secure control of Eskay Creek.
   Corona has said it will pursue talks with Placer about
merging Stikine and Prime Resources into an operating company
to develop Eskay Creek. A Placer spokesman has said the
company would "look favorably" on talks with Corona. A Corona
spokesman said no discussions have taken place.

   DAVENPORT, Iowa -- Lee Enterprises Inc. said it paid $100
million to acquire the remaining 50% stake in its Napp
Systems Inc. joint venture from partner Nippon Paint Co. of
Japan.
   The two companies have operated jointly the San Marcos,
Calif.-based maker of printing plates for 17 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lee, which operates a chain of small-to-midsize newspapers
and has broadcast holdings, said it and Nippon Paint "have
agreed that single company ownership is better than a joint
venture" to meet what it called "increasing competitive
pressures and technological innovations." Lee said it expects
the unit will be able, with a single management team, to
respond more swiftly to such conditions.
   The venture, which had 1989 sales of about $75 million, is
profitable, according to Lee. The company declined to
disclose the venture's earnings. Lee has historically, under
accounting rules, reported its half of the venture's net
income both as earnings and in its revenue figures. Once the
transaction is completed, Lee's revenue will show the full
amount of Napp's sales.
   Chief Financial Officer Michael J. Riley said Napp has
about 50% of the market in its specialized printing-plate
field, "and that figure is growing."
   A "lot of analysts are expecting (Lee's earnings for 1990)
to be down, after analyzing our basic businesses," Mr. Riley
said. But as a result of the transaction to take full
ownership of Napp, "Our bottom line should be up for the
year," he said.

   Purity Products Inc., Baltimore, and a sister company,
Purity Products of Virginia Inc., Petersburg, Va., have
agreed to settle an 18-month-old suit brought by Tropicana
Products Inc., Bradenton, Fla., a unit of Seagram Co.
   In the federal suit, Tropicana alleged that the two
distributors secretly sold the Tropicana products to
retailers and wholesalers outside the Baltimore area in
breach of their distribution contracts. Tropicana's general
counsel, Steven B. Gold, says the scheme allowed the
distributors to pocket promotional discounts paid by
Tropicana and to profit further by undercutting other
distributors in those areas that also sold Tropicana
products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gold says the distributors agreed to stop diverting
Tropicana products and to pay Tropicana $510,000 rather than
face trial on racketeering charges and punitive damages
exceeding $1 million.
   Ivan Goldstein, president of both distribution companies,
declined to comment.
   Last year, a federal judge in Tampa, Fla., denied the
distributors' motion to dismiss the suit. Tropicana, the
judge ruled, had listed hundreds of violations by the
distributors that showed a pattern of racketeering occurring
in a specified period of time.

   Junk-Bond Sale

   Portfolio of Troubled Thrift
   Is Said to Attract Bids
   Close to Its Book Value

   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association's big junk-bond sale
apparently moved a step closer to getting off the ground. The
troubled thrift's portfolio attracted bids at least within 5%
to 10% of its $2.9 billion book value despite tougher terms,
people close to the transaction said.
   Yesterday was the deadline that Columbia and federal
regulators had set for bidding for the bonds. And a person
close to the process indicated that at least one bidder had
offered in the range of $2.7 billion. Such a bid, if
ultimately accepted, could be a significant milestone for the
beleaguered thrift and government regulators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Columbia is insolvent, as previously reported, because of
$1 billion in losses and market declines in the value of its
junkbond portfolio the past several months. Most analysts say
any sale of the bonds is still unlikely to save Columbia from
being taken over by federal regulators and further
dismantled. Moreover, the complex nature of the sale and the
fact that it is likely to receive further intense political
and regulatory scrutiny make a completed deal still far from
certain.
   A few months ago, however, many analysts considered
chances of a sale of the bonds to be remote at best and said
the government itself would end up having to liquidate the
portfolio at a huge discount. Thus, the sale at a price even
within striking distance of book value could significantly
reduce any ultimate taxpayer losses from Columbia's collapse.
   Analysts agree that Columbia has benefited from a modest
reversal in recent weeks of the free fall that the junk-bond
market found itself in last autumn and winter. And many
analysts said Columbia's offer to finance 85% to 90% of the
transaction on a nonrecourse basis was a major further
inducement. Nonrecourse financing means that in event of
default, a buyer's risk is limited to the down payment and
Columbia essentially would be stuck again with the bonds.
   Such financing is also a controversial bet by the
government that the bonds won't drop sharply in value and
motivate the buyer to dump them back on the government, which
would then bear more losses.
   Likely bidders have included Loews Corp., Bankers Trust
New York Corp. and the Los Angeles financial-services firm
Broad Inc., according to published reports. Those firms have
declined to comment.
   Officials of Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
also declined to comment yesterday.
   The bond sale is required under a provision of last year's
thrift bailout law. The law and its subsequent interpretation
also require Columbia to carry the bonds on its books at
market value, although some people familiar with the bidding
said there was some disagreement over whether the latest $2.9
billion value is too high.
   In the end, Columbia apparently toughened terms for the
sale in response to government concerns, which apparently put
a lid on the bidding, some people close to the process said.
For instance, one person said the government hopes to see any
note issued as part of the sale be rated as investment-grade.
To that end, for instance, the person said the thrift was
proposing to rather significantly restrict the ability of a
buyer to freely sell the bonds that would secure the note.
   "Regulators want to go to Congress and say they got a note
back rated investment-grade -- that they are not taking back
a junk note for junk bonds," one person close to the bidding
said.
   Besides the junk bonds, Columbia has an estimated $100
million to $200 million in warrants covering equity interests
in many of the companies for which it holds junk bonds. Some
people close to the bidding indicated that the thrift may
have been marketing those securities as part of the junkbond
sale, which could further boost the final price.
   Yesterday, the Office of Thrift Supervision confirmed
reports that it had hired Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. to help the
agency evaluate the bids. Kidder once was criticized by
credit agencies and the New York Stock Exchange about its own
junk-bond holdings, which it recently sold to its parent,
General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn. An OTS spokesman said
the firm was chosen for its "substantial expertise." First
Boston Corp. has been Columbia's adviser.
   Columbia built its junk-bond portfolio into the largest in
the thrift industry in part because of close ties between its
former chief executive officer Thomas Spiegel and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond proponent Michael Milken.
   This month, the OTS filed an administrative complaint
against Mr. Spiegel, alleging that he diverted $19 million in
Columbia's funds to personal use; Mr. Spiegel has adamantly
denied the charge.

   RJR Nabisco's Junk Bonds Rise Sharply in Price
   As Investors Respond to Refinancing Program

   NEW YORK -- Investors rushed to buy RJR Nabisco Inc.'s
newly glamorous junk bonds, propelling prices sharply higher,
in reaction to the company's huge refinancing program.
   The tobacco and food company touched off the buying spree
by announcing details of a $6.9 billion refinancing designed
to strengthen its balance sheet and ward off a potential
financial crisis. The plan includes retiring many of the
company's most troublesome junk bonds by buying them back in
the open market and by an exchange offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco's announcement helped lift prices of other
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds yesterday. Elsewhere in the
U.S. bond markets, though, most interest rates were little
changed, taking a breather after having fallen late last week
as the Federal Reserve eased credit slightly.
   Long-term Treasury bond yields hovered in a narrow band
all day yesterday, finishing the session almost exactly where
they began. For example, 30-year Treasury bonds now yield
8.45%, the same as late Friday. Treasury bill rates also were
flat, and municipal bond prices ended little changed.
   Federal Reserve officials probably won't cut interest
rates any further until a clearer picture of the economy
emerges in August, investment managers and economists say.
Several money managers fear that the Fed acted too soon, that
inflation will remain stubbornly high, and thus that
short-term bonds represent a much better buy right now than
long-term bonds.
   Moreover, traders are bracing for a huge wave of U.S.
government borrowing next month that some analysts predict
will nudge interest rates back up over the next few weeks.
The Treasury's quarterly financing, which typically consists
of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds, is
expected in early August. "There's also a great deal of
concern about the budget deficit and concern that politics is
ruling the day" once again, said William Brachfeld, executive
vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
   While U.S. bonds stalled yesterday, British government
bond prices surged in brisk trading. Traders cited the
British pound's recent strength in the foreign-exchange
markets as well as unexpectedly weak U.K. economic reports
that could indicate reduced inflationary pressures. West
German government bond prices also climbed.
   To keep the U.S. bond market rally going, "new evidence of
a slower economy probably will have to emerge," said John
Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"However, we do not foresee a deep enough decline in economic
activity that would open the way for a significant bond
rally."
   Thomas G. Moles, managing director in charge of fixed
income investments at J&amp;W Seligman Inc., agrees that the Fed
probably won't cut rates again in the near future. "What the
Fed's going to do is sit back and see what the market
reaction is" to last week's credit-easing move before taking
further action, he said.
   Still, Mr. Moles recommends buying longer-term bonds,
especially top-rated issues. "We're increasingly leaning
toward higher-quality issues," he said. "Reaching for yield"
by buying lower-rated issues wouldn't be smart, he said, in
view of the economy's listlessness.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Investors reacted enthusiastically to RJR Nabisco Inc.'s
refinancing plan.
   RJR's 14.07% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due in
2009, which were reset to yield 17.375% under the new plan,
soared 8 1/4 points to 114 3/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Pay-in-kind debentures pay interest in the form of
addition securities.
   The other widely held RJR issue, the 14.07% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, which have been
reset to yield 17%, jumped 4 5/8 points to 91 3/4.
   Investors who bought RJR Nabisco's bonds early this year
and held them have made a fortune. Prices of some issues have
nearly doubled over the last six months amid speculation that
the company's controlling owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co., would take steps to lighten RJR's enormous debt burden.
KKR took the company private in a $25 billion leveraged
takeover, the largest in history.
   Prices of other corporate junk bonds rose about one point,
traders said. Also, while volume in RJR Pay-in-kind bonds was
triple the recent daily average, activity in other bonds was
about double.
   Among high-grade corporate bonds, prices were little
changed. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. tapped the
markets with new debt issues.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities

   Treasury bond yields hardly budged all day. Trading
activity was sluggish.
   Among actively traded issues, the government's 30-year
bonds were quoted late yesterday at a price of about 103 1/4,
to yield 8.45%, the same as late Friday.
   "The bond market had its big excitement on Thursday and
Friday" of last week, said Joseph Liro, a vice president at
S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan disclosed
Thursday that the Fed was poised to ease credit. Then on
Friday, the central bank acted, trimming rates slightly. The
Fed's move resulted in a drop in the interest rate on federal
funds, or funds that banks lend each overnight, by 0.25
percentage point to 8%.
   But banks haven't yet responded by lowering their prime
lending rate, which remains stuck at 10%. The prime rate is
closely watched because banks use it as a peg to set rates on
a large number of loans to individuals as well as small and
medium-sized companies.
   The Treasury yesterday held its regular weekly sale of new
three-month and six-month bills. Here are details:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated July 19. The 13-week bills mature

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bond prices surged again yesterday.
   U.K. government bonds are attracting more investors
because of growing signs that Britain's weak economy will
help depress inflation, pull down interest rates and drive up
bond prices.
   Investors also are attracted by Britain's high interest
rates and its "inverted yield curve," which means short-term
rates there are higher than long-term bond yields.
   Britain's 11.75% bonds due 2003/2007, which traders watch
as an indicator of long-term bonds in general, climbed
yesterday by 22/32 of a point yesterday to 102 31/32, to
yield 11.30%.
   Among other active issues, the 12% bonds due 1995 rose
14/32 of a point to yield 12.01%. Traders cited retail sales
and industrial production figures as evidence of U.K. economy
weakness.
   In other major markets:
   -- West German government bond prices also rose. Bonn's
8.75% benchmark bonds, due 2000, rose 0.45 point to 101.75 to
yield 8.47%.
   -- Japanese government bond prices inched higher. Trading
was relatively light.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   The mortgage securities market ended unchanged to
marginally higher after a lifeless session in both the
primary and secondary markets.
   No major new offerings were priced yesterday.
   Although price movement has been negligible, the secondary
market continues to benefit from the dearth of new issuance,
which has been combined with solid demand from dealers and
retail accounts in recent days.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were up 2/32 at 99
23/ 32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were
2/32 higher at 99 2/32 and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues were up 2/32 at 99 18/ 32.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended narrowly mixed, with a large number
of issues unchanged to as much as 1/4 point higher.
   Municipal players are already turning their attention to
the week's new-issue calendar, where more than $1.5 billion
is expected to be priced.
   In two of the week's largest issues New York will sell
$225 million various purpose general obligation bonds today.
   Also Tuesday, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group is
expected to price $325 million Connecticut general obligation
bonds.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% bonds of 2018 were unchanged at 99 1/2 to
yield 7.30%.

   TAMPA, Fla. -- Florida Federal Savings Bank, embroiled in
a two-year investigation of its student loans, agreed to pay
the U.S. $17.9 million as part of a civil settlement.
   The settlement, disclosed by a U.S. attorney in Florida,
covers "false claims" filed with the Department of Education
by the thrift under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. That
program makes low-interest loans available to students for
college expenses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1988, Florida Federal, St. Petersburg, Fla., came under
scrutiny for allegedly filing as many as 17,000 fraudulent
insurance claims on $35 million in government-backed student
loans. The investigation helped spark a management shake-up
that resulted in the resignation of the thrift's chairman.
   Earlier this year, Florida Federal was fined $2,150,000
after its conviction on charges, including conspiracy and
filing false claims, related to the student-loan case. Two
former officers were also convicted of falsifying statements,
and a third has been indicted on several charges and awaits
trial.
   Florida Federal has also agreed to correct the records of
students whose credit standing was hurt by the fraud
committed by Florida Federal, the U.S. attorney's office
said.
   In St. Petersburg, Florida Federal officials couldn't be
reached.

   Anchor Savings Bank definitively agreed to sell $400
million of deposits at 18 of its Georgia branches to the
Trust Co. of Georgia unit of SunTrust Banks Inc.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but the sale price will be
released in public filings later, said John V. Brull, Anchor
senior vice president and chief financial officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The savings bank has said that shedding its Georgia
interests is part of its plan, approved by regulators in
mid-April, to comply with new thrift-capital standards.
Anchor wants to concentrate on the New York metropolitan
area.
   Trust Co. takes over the checking, savings and certificate
of deposit accounts of Anchor's branches in Fulton, DeKalb,
Douglas, Cobb, Gwinnett and Chatham counties. Trust Co. won't
take over the real estate and leases, and Anchor will seek
other buyers for them, Mr. Brull said. Anchor also will
retain the unsecured loans from those branches in its
portfolio.
   Anchor, which entered the Georgia market in 1982, has six
other branches in the state. Anchor has agreed to sell one of
them to Home Federal Savings Bank of Atlanta and is close to
a sale agreement on another, Mr. Brull said. The four others
are for sale.

   Law:
   Judges Join
   Big Fray
   On Asbestos

   As if the asbestos litigation against the Manville Corp.
personal-injury trust wasn't tangled enough, now judges
handling the thousands of cases appear to be squabbling over
turf.
   Two weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, of
Brooklyn, N.Y., urged lawyers involved in the cases, which
allege injuries resulting from exposure to asbestos, to
consider consolidating all the cases nationwide into one
courtroom, presumably his.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Judge Weinstein never issued an official order that
would call for such a consolidation.
   Late yesterday U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Lambros of
Cleveland did.
   In what some lawyers are calling a pre-emptive strike
against Judge Weinstein, Judge Lambros ordered the
establishment of a single national class of claimants in all
asbestos-related personal injury cases.
   In a class-action suit, typically all similar claims are
tried together, instead of separately, with several named
plaintiffs standing in as representatives of the entire
class. Damages are generally awarded under some sort of
formula devised for the particular case.
   The virtue of a class action is that, at least
theoretically, the available money for damages is divided in
such a way that every plaintiff gets his fair share. In
contrast, when the cases are tried separately, the first
plaintiffs to win judgments can deplete the defendant's
resources, leaving nothing for any other claimants.
   Judge Lambros's order effectively prevents any other judge
from consolidating the cases in any other court at this time.
Judge Lambros, the chief judge of the Cleveland federal
courts, presides over 7,000 asbestos-related cases involving
more than 13,000 individuals' claims. As a practical matter,
the judge's surprise move could induce the federal
administrative office of the courts to step in as a referee
and decide where the cases should be tried.
   The move by Judge Lambros follows increasing problems with
the Manville trust, set up by Denver-based Manville in 1986
to pay the company's asbestos personal-injury claims. The
trust is a defendant in nearly 100,000 cases before 500 state
courts and in each of the nation's federal jurisdictions. In
recent weeks, it has come under fire because of its huge cash
shortfall.
   Last week, Judge Weinstein gave the Manville trust until
Aug. 6 to restructure its financing and to change the way it
pays asbestos victims. He issued a temporary stay barring the
trust from paying any settlements, judgments, trustees' fees
or plaintiffs' attorneys fees until the changes are made.
   The move worried the community of attorneys representing
the claimants. They said they were concerned that Judge
Weinstein, who is known to favor giving as much money as
possible to the claimants, would cut the attorneys' fees to
the bone if he gained control of all the cases. Indeed, Judge
Weinstein, in suggesting consolidation, indicated that his
biggest concern with the current tangle of cases was what he
considered to be runaway attorneys fees.
   Judge Weinstein declined to comment late yesterday, as did
a representative for the Manville trust. Some plaintiffs'
attorneys predicted that Judge Lambros's order would be
appealed.
   Individuals familiar with the situation said that last
week some plaintiffs' lawyers met in Chicago to discuss their
concern that Judge Weinstein might be ready to certify a
national class of claimants and bring the cases to Brooklyn.
   One of the individuals said the attorneys decided to seek
out judges who they believed were more lenient toward
plaintiffs' attorneys and try to get them to take control of
the cases. Judge Lambros was said to be one of these judges.
Judge Lambros couldn't be reached for comment last night, but
he is understood to have denied any undue pressure.
   In his order yesterday, Judge Lambros said the asbestos
litigation meets the criteria for creating a single class
action because "it has become apparent to judges managing
these cases that there are insufficent funds among all of the
defendants to pay all meritorious claims and all the costs
associated with processing the claims through the judicial
system."
   Lawyers contacted late yesterday expressed some
uncertainty about the precise meaning of certain aspects of
the order. While he called for a national class action, the
judge also established "subclasses" for existing cases. Some
lawyers interpreted this to mean that those cases already on
trial dockets in the nation's courts should remain where they
are.
   The order said the largest concentration of cases
involving asbestos claims is in Judge Lambros's court.
   The judge also said the only group that could veto his
order was an ad hoc committee of judges with the largest
asbestos dockets. The group met for the first time at the end
of June.

   I enjoyed Michael Gartner's letter to Dr. Louis Sullivan
(Viewpoint, June 7). However, a small correction is in order.
Mr. Gartner states, ". . . the constant campaign against
smoking waged first by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. . .
."
   Of course, the "constant campaign against smoking" was
waged first by my father, Dr. Luther L. Terry. His
courageous, ground-breaking report in 1964 when he was
surgeon general represented the first salvo against the
largest preventable cause of death and disability in our
nation. Dr. Koop himself has on numerous occasions cited
Dad's work as providing the scientific and moral foundation
for the 26 years of efforts that have followed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To quote from Joseph A. Califano's eulogy at my father's
funeral:
   "Luther Terry saved as many lives as any Salk or Pasteur
or Madame Curie. He is as much a medical giant. But he is
more. No powerful economic forces rose up to defend polio, or
smallpox or unsafe milk. When Luther Terry told us of the
dangers of smoking, political and financial powers of magnum
force rose to attack him. His discovery was one they had
tried to hide, one they didn't want to talk about. But Luther
spoke out. Softly, but firmly he stood his ground. He
persevered, and in the end he revolutionized our thinking
about the causes of modern-day diseases. Many of us have
walked and will walk in his footsteps, but none of us can
fill his shoes. . . ."
   The Terry family is gratified with the work of those who
followed Dad, particularly Dr. Koop, whose dedication and
unquestioned integrity in the latest assault on smoking are
familiar echoes. But I ask you to remember the man who
started it all, a brave, self-effacing hero, Luther Terry.

   Marketing:
   Consumer-Products Firms Hit the Books,
   Trying to Teach Brand Loyalty in School

   Along with daily doses of reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic,
children in many public schools around the country are
getting powerful lessons on a more controversial subject:
brand loyalty.
   As never before, some of the nation's best-known
marketers, including Coca-Cola Co., International Business
Machines Corp. and Reebok International Ltd., are devising
ways to slip advertising messages into the nation's schools.
The pace has escalated as officials in financially strapped
school districts look to the business community for support.
Many consumer-products companies are happy to oblige -- with
a few strings attached.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The best-known classroom pitchman remains Christopher
Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications L.P. His launch
in March of a closed-circuit television network that includes
two minutes of ads on a daily news program for students
touched off a barrage of criticism. Yet the controversy has
hardly dissuaded other companies from launching their own
educational marketing programs.
   This fall, Donnelley Marketing, a unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet
Corp., will enlist an army of home economics, health and gym
teachers to hand out product samples and coupons to 2.4
million junior high and high school students. Scholastic
Inc., among the nation's largest publisher of books and
magazines for children, will crank out single-sponsor
magazines and other teaching tools for some 40 companies,
including such heavyweights as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. and Mars Inc.'s M&amp;M/Mars division.
   Cover Concepts Marketing Services Inc. will send one
million high school students textbook covers that promote
such brands as Nike Inc. shoes and Mars's Milky Way candy
bars. School Properties USA Inc. will help 15 state school
associations sign up corporate sponsors, including Reebok,
for high school sports events.
   Marketers are so interested in the classroom because the
kids' market is so big: Teen-agers alone buy an estimated $78
billion in goods each year -- and they cajole their parents
into spending up to twice that amount. Moreover, while TV
viewers at home often zap to another channel at commercial
breaks, kids in the classroom are a captive audience to whom
ads may seem a welcome break from studies. And because school
marketing is relatively untried, there's little clutter to
cut through.
   "The kids we're reaching are consumers in training," says
Joseph Fenton, director of cooperative marketing at
Donnelley. "You want to reach consumers at their most
formative point."
   Others are far less enthusiastic about the trend. Today,
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, is
releasing a study that decries the "nonstop advertising
barrage on America's children." The report documents five
major categories, including classroom ads, in which the
number of commercial messages is growing at "an alarming
rate."
   Some of the nation's school administrators are doing heavy
soul-searching. On the one hand, harried teachers have been
receptive to packaged teaching aids, such as the AT&amp;T
Adventure Club, a program developed for the
telecommunications giant by Scholastic. The program, which
includes student newsletters, classroom posters and teaching
guides, is designed to foster understanding of communications
and build AT&amp;T brand awareness among first-graders. "Teachers
are crying for the information," says Kathleen Redmond, youth
market manager for AT&amp;T.
   But many educators complain that companies are more
interested in expanding markets than minds. School officials
say marketers and their hired guns can't be trusted to
develop unbiased educational materials. Moreover, since
children under 16 years old are required to attend school --
and those in public schools are educated at taxpayer expense
-- classroom ads raise ethical questions.
   "Parents are entrusting their kids to the schools," says
Bill Honig, California's state superintendent of public
instruction. "We have no right to sell access to that captive
market."
   Gary Marx, associate executive director of the American
Association of School Administrators, says opening school
doors to marketers now will result in an intolerable
situation down the road. "Will we eventually be selling
one-minute spots in fifth-grade geography?" Mr. Marx asks.
"The classroom should be a marketplace of ideas, not
products."
   Marketers and publishers say they're providing a
legitimate service for schools. "Our mission is education,"
says Michele Magazine, a senior vice president at Scholastic.
"We are very careful that it's not just a disguised sales
pitch."
   Still, fearful that objections from parents and educators
will result in a backlash, many marketers already are
scrambling to blunt the criticisms. Many hold that Whittle's
Channel One irks educators because it's intrusive: Teachers
must agree to have their students watch the program most days
in order for schools to qualify for free TV equipment. The
real problem isn't the ads, they say, but the fact that
teachers are forced to relinquish control over the
curriculum.
   To make teachers feel empowered, Donnelley Marketing,
which distributes coupons and product samples, is soliciting
their cooperation in advance. The direct-marketing company
recently hooked up with Modern Talking Pictures Services Inc.
to query 100,000 home economics, health and gym teachers
nationwide. Modern Talking Pictures, best known for
distributing educational films to schools, has found about
10,000 teachers who have agreed to hand out an array of
product samples to their students this fall. Teachers were
even asked what products they wouldn't want in their
classroom, lest the samples offend anyone. (Among those on
various teachers' forbidden lists were contraceptives and
guns.)
   Along with the samples, some teachers will receive lesson
plans to help them lecture on such subjects as the role of
deodorants. And to appease teachers, the educational
materials won't invoke any brand names. "We truly have an
educational overlay, and we're there at the request of the
teacher," says Donnelley's Mr. Fenton. By next spring, Mr.
Fenton says, he hopes to reach 2.5 million students with
lessons as well as loot.
   Scholastic is counting on the credibility it has
established with educators over the past 70 years -- it
publishes 31 classroom magazines read by about 23 million
kids -- to help marketers ease into schools. Since it started
its own educational marketing unit about 18 months ago, the
New York-based company has signed up a roster of powerful
marketers interested in helping schools and burnishing their
image with consumers.
   Coca-Cola's Minute Maid unit, for example, was interested
in fighting illiteracy -- and enhancing the wholesome image
of its juice products. So in May, Scholastic helped
coordinate a program designed to encourage some 3.7 million
elementary school kids to read a book a week over their
summer vacation. Kids who sent away for a chart to keep track
of their progress also received coupons for Minute Maid
products. For each coupon redeemed, Minute Maid will donate
10 cents to a nonprofit organization that promotes reading.
   Despite the proliferation of marketing programs in
schools, corporate enthusiasm may not be long-lived. In part,
that's because so many companies are beating down the school
door that freedom from clutter may quickly evaporate.
Moreover, educators are poised to enforce tougher standards.
In recent months, the issue of commercialism in schools has
become a top concern for the National Parent-Teacher
Association, says Arnold Fege, a spokesman for the group.
   "Parents are getting fed up with marketers," Mr. Fege
says. "We can't just sell off our curricula to the highest
bidder."

   U.S. Is in Better Shape Than Figures Show

ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)

   Prices.
   That's the way that John O'Riley, a retired assistant
managing editor of this newspaper, once started a column. The
piece moved on from there, of course, but Mr. O'Riley wanted
to be sure he had focussed the readers' minds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He had reason to be careful. Prices can be a very dull
subject when they're not moving much. Economics graduate
students love to play around with theories and equations
dealing with the economy. Although much of economics would be
meaningless without accurate measurement of prices, there is
relatively little research about how prices are actually
measured.
   Theodore W. Schultz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, once
summed up the problem this way, "There is much to be said in
favor of the recent impressive advances in quantitative
techniques but to benefit from them there must be a real
commitment to measurement. For want of commitment, we abide
the lack of adequate data which greatly limits the usefulness
of these new techniques. . . . Very few university economists
are engaged in `making data' that will stand up under strong
empirical analysis." For that quotation, I am indebted to
Robert J. Gordon, a university economist of whom Prof.
Schultz surely must approve. Prof. Gordon, who teaches at
Northwestern, labored for nearly two decades to produce a
book with the unsexy title, "The Measurement of Durable Goods
Prices" (National Bureau of Economic Research). Prof.
Gordon's wife, he tells us, came to refer to the project as
his NVER book.
   To revert to O'Riley-style, Who cares? If Prof. Gordon is
right, a great many people ought to care. His figures
indicate that the rise in durable goods prices in the 1947-83
period was much slower than the official figures indicate. A
couple of results: Capital equipment investment, in
inflation-adjusted terms, has risen more rapidly than we
thought -- and so has durable goods productivity.
   The problem with the official measures is that they have
failed to account for much of the improvement in the quality
of consumer and business durable goods. Businesses are
turning out goods that are lighter, faster, more
energy-efficient and more reliable than their predecessors,
and they haven't received anything like full credit for it.
   One example: computers. In the early 1950s electronic
computers began appearing on commercial markets, and the
world has never quite been the same. For more than two
decades, government statisticians figured computer prices
remained about unchanged. After all, this year's machine cost
the same as last year's. That was true enough, but for a long
time the official measures didn't acknowledge that this
year's machine could do far more than last year's.
   In a benchmark revision in 1985, the Commerce Department's
Bureau of Economic Analysis introduced a deflator for the
computer component of producers' durable equipment dating
back to 1969. When quality was taken into account, it was
apparent that the true prices of computer services had fallen
sharply. The national income and product accounts still
assume that computer prices remained fixed before 1969. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics, Prof. Gordon says in his book,
still includes no price index for computers in its producer
price index.
   Computers, of course, are something of a special case. But
Prof. Gordon's research indicates a broad, if often less
spectacular, improvement in quality -- much of which has not
been picked up by official price measurements.
   Measuring prices, important as it is, isn't easy.
Government agencies struggle against obstacles that academic
researchers do not face. The Bureau of Labor Statistics,
which has primary responsibility for the consumer and
producer price indexes, cannot revise earlier numbers because
the figures are used to escalate legal price and wage
contracts. So it must push on into the future, looking for
better procedures, even if it knows that numbers for past
periods are wrong.
   The Bureau of Economic Analysis has no such curb on
historical research; in fact, it makes major benchmark
revisions every five years. But BEA has other
responsibilities, and Prof. Gordon figures historical
research ranks low on its list.
   To complicate matters, Congress from time to time hands
the agencies chores that must be done, whether or not there
is still any interest in the results. Each month, for
example, BLS must report the number of "discouraged workers,"
a statistic that Congress once wanted because some members
were surprised that the official unemployment rate was so
low. Few people monitor the number now, but BLS must still
collect the data.
   Whatever the problems, Prof. Gordon is convinced that the
agencies could do a better job. He hopes that his 723-page
book will be a starting point for more research. His new
indexes cover a wide range of durable goods and provide more
quality adjustments than the official numbers. But they do
not touch on nondurable goods or on the biggest puzzle of
all, services.
   The Gordon study indicates that durable goods producers
have been more productive in the postwar years than we
thought. Mr. Gordon's research, however, does little to
explain why overall productivity has slowed in the post-1973
period.
   Prof. Gordon offers a long list of quality improvements he
did not manage to deal with in his book. For example, the
reduced noise and vibration of jet planes has cut the need
for attendants to deal with air sickness. The jet planes can
fly above thunder storms and their safety record has been
superior to that of piston planes.
   Prices, as Mr. O'Riley would admit, are hard to figure,
and perfection is unattainable. But their significance
suggests that we should do a better job than we do now.

   NEW YORK -- Nicholas J. DeMarco, head of Pierre Cardin
USA, said he was forced to resign his post after 12 years and
filed a suit against the Paris-based fashion design company.
   Mr. DeMarco's civil action, filed in New York State
Supreme Court, has been transferred to federal court in
Manhattan. The suit charges Mr. Cardin and his company,
S.A.R.L. de Gestion Pierre Cardin, with wrongful termination,
breach of contract, wrongful conversion of U.S. licensing
royalties and fraud. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages
of "not less than $5 million" and punitive damages of "not
less than $5 million."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview, Mr. DeMarco said that he has maintained
an "excellent relationship with Cardin" and speculated that
he was being forced to leave his post to "facilitate the
eventual sale" of Mr. Cardin's world-wide licensing business.
He said he has reason to believe the businesses were up for
sale but declined to elaborate. He said Mr. Cardin hasn't
returned numerous phone calls and messages.
   Maxwell Stolzberg, a Manhattan attorney for S.A.R.L. de
Gestion Pierre Cardin, said: "Mr. Cardin has his own business
reasons for (Mr. Marco's) termination and it had nothing to
do with any sale of his business or licensees. . . . As far
as I am aware, the licenses are not up for sale. . . . The
contract that he had with the Cardin organization provided
for a termination on notice, and that notice was given."
   Pierre Cardin's U.S. licensees encompass 32 companies that
manufacture women's, men's and boy's apparel, generating
about $201 million annually at wholesale prices, according to
Steve Weiner, chairman of the Pierre Cardin licensees in the
U.S.

   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- MGM/UA Communications Co. said it
received a $53 million payment from Pathe Communications
Corp. as part of Pathe's revised $1.3 billion acquisition of
the once-mighty studio.
   Last month, Pathe and MGM/UA revised and extended the
$20-a-share proposed transaction, with Pathe agreeing to pay
MGM/UA shareholders an extra $1.50 a share. In the agreement,
$4 of the $21.50 is to be paid out by July 20 to holders of
record July 10.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the original tender offer, Pathe already had
deposited $200 million into an escrow account as a down
payment on the acquisition. The $53 million represents the
remainder needed to make the interim $4 payment to
shareholders, who will keep the money even if the deal
collapses. If it goes through, holders would get the
remaining $17.50 in October.
   The prior agreement between the two companies had been
backstopped by a proposed $650 million loan by Time Warner
Inc. to Pathe. That agreement fell apart, Pathe and Time
Warner have sued each other, and Pathe is looking for new
sources of financing.
   MGM/UA also said that according to a ruling by the New
York Stock Exchange, MGM/UA shares had been trading on the
basis of one share of stock plus a "due bill" of $4 since
July 3. It is expected that the stock will begin trading
"ex-payment" one business day following the payment date, the
company said.
   The latest payment brings to $253 million the amount Pathe
has advanced toward the transaction since last March. Pathe
has also given MGM/UA a $75 million security interest in
three upcoming Pathe films. According to the revised
agreement, Pathe must deposit $50 million payments on Aug. 21
and Sept. 20.

   LOS ANGELES -- Tim Matheson and Dan Grodnik resigned as
co-chairman and co-chief executive officers of National
Lampoon, citing the previously announced sale of the humor
magazine to J2 Communications for more than $4 million.
   The resignations came as a surprise, because J2 had said
Messrs. Matheson and Grodnik would head the National Lampoon
division after the acquisition was completed. James P.
Jimirro, president and chief executive officer of J2, a video
producer and distributor, will oversee the operation of the
magazine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Messrs. Matheson and Grodnik weren't available for
comment. However, a spokesman for the men said, "They have
guided the company through a transition, and I don't think
they fully planned to continue." He also said the magazine
has been losing money, and the sale to J2 "gave them an
opportunity to plug the leaks and bolster the value of their
stock."
   After the merger, Messrs. Matheson and Grodnik will hold a
total of about a 30% stake in J2. Yesterday, J2 said it
signed a definitive agreement under which National Lampoon
shareholders will receive two-thirds of a share of J2 common
for each National Lampoon share. They will also receive a
warrant to buy one share of J2 at $3.50 or $3.75 each,
depending on the trading level of the stock.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, J2 shares closed at
$2.625.
   Mr. Matheson and Mr. Grodnik wrested control of the
magazine from Matty Simmons, the magazine's former editor,
chairman and largest shareholder.
   The duo helped to increase advertising pages to 40 from 10
and brought back traditional advertisers such as Chrysler
Corp.
   Mr. Jimirro, president and chief executive officer of J2,
is a former head of Disney Channel and Disney Home Video.

   RED BANK, N.J. -- Fiber optics might sound pretty dull --
until Lanny Smoot introduces himself.
   Mr. Smoot sits behind a wall-size window here at Bell
Communications Research, rummaging through papers. He notices
visitors and stops to say hello. But his visitors would need
awfully long arms to shake his hand, because Mr. Smoot is
actually in Morristown, N.J., 55 miles away.

   His image is being projected through fiber optics, and
it's so lifelike that even skeptical reporters are startled
to find he's not simply sitting behind a pane of glass.
   This might seem like video magic, but the uses of fiber
optics are neither far off nor far-fetched. Within just a few
years, fiber optics "is going to change the way we live and
the way we do business. It's going to completely transform
our world," says Stewart Personick, a fiber optics pioneer
and an assistant vice president at Bell Communications
Research.
   Fiber optics could change television within a few years by
allowing more choices for more people and a much wider range
of video services. Telephone companies are testing links that
let doctors transmit X-rays and other diagnostic tests to
distant specialists for instant evaluations.
   Another likely development: artificial-reality machines
that use remarkably crisp pictures and sound to "deliver" a
viewer to a pristine tropical beach, to a big football game
or to a quiet mountaintop retreat. Japanese researchers
envision golfers practicing their swings in front of
three-dimensional simulations of courses.
   The spread of fiber optic networks could have profound
implications for where and how people live and work. As such
sophisticated communications become more commonplace,
business travel could be reduced. The efficiency of fiber
networks also raises the prospect that work forces won't need
to be so concentrated: Many employees will be able to
contribute to organizations without having to live in or near
big cities.
   "Doctors could have world offices, not local offices. And
I could go on vacation -- or pick a vacation spot -- by
immersing myself in a different environment, stroll down the
streets of Barcelona or along a Caribbean beach," says Mr.
Smoot, an executive at Bell Communications Research.
   The technology is so powerful that last month the Commerce
Department refused to lift its ban on exporting fiber systems
to the Soviet Union. Citing national security, the agency
rejected a plan by U S West Inc. to build a trans-Soviet
fiber network that would link Japan and Europe. At the same
time, however, the U.S. allowed shipment of older and slower
fiber technology to Eastern Europe.
   Even in the U.S., significant obstacles must be overcome
before the promise of fiber optics becomes reality. Phone
companies are finding it difficult to offer fiber
universally. Sharks like to chew on undersea fiber cables.
Bringing fiber to homes and small businesses is proving
especially tough. And fiber itself isn't a flawless
technology. For example, there's the challenge of keeping
phone service working when electric power goes out.
   Underlying all these issues is a more fundamental question
of economics: whether there will be enough demand for fiber
services to justify speeding up construction of a nationwide
fiber-based broad-band network, conservatively estimated to
cost $250 billion.
   Meantime, telephone companies and cable television firms
are battling over the vast potential market. Because so much
can be carried on fiber optic lines, phone companies could
use their lines for cable TV. But phone companies are
currently barred from the cable business, and cable companies
are working to make sure that doesn't change.
   Fiber optics uses hair-thin strands of super-clear glass,
instead of copper wire, to carry conversations, images and
data. Whereas copper wire uses electrical impulses, fiber
optics relies on light to deliver the message.
   A single fiber strand can transmit 16,000 phone
conversations at once, compared with 24 for the 100-year-old
copper wire technology.
   It can transport symphony-quality sound, high-definition
television signals and fantastic amounts of data. And since
light travels a lot faster than electricity, the speed is
awesome: The entire text of the Encyclopaedia Britannica and
the Bible could travel around the Earth through a fiber cable
in less than two seconds.
   "All of the voice communications and all of the data
communications today are but a tiny trickle of what could be
carried in the future," says Mr. Smoot. "We're sort of like
the blind who have never seen."
   Over the past five years, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., MCI Communications Corp., United Telecommunications
Inc.'s US Sprint and other long-distance carriers have
installed millions of miles of fiber optic cable. Small
telecommunications firms are building rings of fiber cable in
big cities. Local telephone companies are stringing fiber
between their major switching offices and conducting tests in
neighborhoods.
   By most counts, much of the U.S. will be "glassed" by the
year 2015.
   The idea of sending messages by light is as ancient as
signal fires. John Tyndall, a British physicist who explained
why the sky is blue, enlivened his lectures during the 1870s
by demonstrating that light can bend. He focused a beam
through a huge container of water with a spout near the
bottom. As the water shot out and bent with the force of
gravity, the audience could see light trapped within the
stream.
   In the 1880s, Alexander Graham Bell proved that a light
beam could carry voice signals. And in the 1960s, when the
laser emerged from Bell Labs and scientists in England
advocated using ultra-pure glass fibers to transmit phone
calls, fiber optics jumped to the fast track.
   Soon after, Corning Inc. developed glass so clear that if
oceans were made of it, the bottom of the Mariana Trench,
nearly six miles below the surface of the Pacific, would be
visible. In 1983, MCI placed the first commercial order for
90,000 miles of fiber cable.
   These days, high-capacity fiber can dispatch 1.8 billion
bits of information a second over a single wispy strand of
glass. This is how: A transmitter containing a tiny laser
converts electrical signals that represent human voices,
computer data, text or pictures into modulated light waves --
flashes of ones and zeros -- for digital transmission. The
most sophisticated lasers, with a light source no bigger than
a grain of salt, blink on and off about one billion times a
second.
   At the other end, a photo detector picks up the signal and
transforms the flashes back to an electrical signal that can
be reconverted to voice, data or video.
   Several signals can be fed into the glass strand at the
same time and yet remain discrete even after traveling many
miles at top speed. Electrical signals, on the other hand,
tend to mingle after a short trip through copper wire. And
unlike copper, fiber can carry signals in both directions at
the same time.
   One of the earliest benefits to come roaring down the
fiber autobahn will be crystal-clear video conferencing.
Consider Mr. Smoot's image. It is delivered over a large
rear-projection, high-resolution screen set into the wall.
Multiple camera angles give a panoramic view, leaving the
viewer with the impression of looking through a window.
   Most video conferencing over phone lines today doesn't
provide full-motion pictures, so an executive's wave creates
a blur across the screen. The video switches that will be
part of the fiber optic network will let customers receive
full-motion movies and other video works on demand. The
switches will also let them send crisp, full-motion video
pictures. Parents could send videos of their children to
relatives across the country -- either tapes from last
Thanksgiving or a live birthday party.
   Prototypes have been developed, but none is commercially
available. Much needs to be done before that happens.
   More than four million miles of fiber optic cable have now
been laid across the U.S., much of it alongside railroad and
subway tracks. Even abandoned coal tunnels beneath the
streets of Chicago now provide a home for fiber cable. To
link continents, thousands of miles of fiber have been reeled
from huge boats. AT&amp;T has its own fleet.
   A month after a cable was installed in the Atlantic off
the Canary Islands five years ago, the connection went dead,
or "dark" in the parlance of fiber optics. Hauling the cable
up, technicians found shark teeth embedded in the casing. One
bite had shorted the cable. After three more outages,
technicians set about creating a Jaws-proof sheath.
   The teeth didn't go to waste. They were set in a dental
mold and used to test designs.
   The major deterrent to the spread of fiber is cost. Until
recently, it was far more expensive than copper. But before
long, fiber will cost less than copper because of
efficiencies and higher production.
   Yet even though fiber is already beginning to make sense
economically for new construction and replacement -- some new
housing developments are being strung with glass instead of
wire -- ripping out copper before the end of its useful life
and replacing it with fiber is too expensive.
   Another problem is keeping the phones working in a power
failure. The typical telephone receiver operates on
electricity. Because copper conducts electricity well, the
power for today's phone service comes over the phone lines
themselves, and the phones can even be powered by back-up
batteries in case of an outage. That's what happened in the
San Francisco earthquake. But glass fiber isn't an efficient
conductor of electricity, so phones might have to be powered
by the local electric company. If there were a local power
outage, there would be a phone outage, too. Phone companies
are considering alternatives such as backup batteries.
   GTE Corp. is conducting the largest and most sophisticated
fiber trial in the U.S. to date. In Cerritos, Calif., the
company has joined the local cable operator to test a fiber
network that will connect up to 700 households. About 100
will receive telephone and TV signals over the same fiber
line. At the same time, the two are testing a coaxial network
for interactive video and pay-per-view movies.
   Customers in some homes and a demonstration center at
GTE's Cerritos lab site will be able to send home videos back
and forth, as well as order up movies. Unlike in regular
pay-TV, viewers will have all the conveniences of using a
VCR: They will be able to stop the movie and watch the rest
of it later, to fast-forward through dull passages, or to
replay favorite scenes.
   Across the country, about 50 small cities or developments
are being "glassed" for various phone-company trials.
   But regulatory and social-policy questions remain to be
settled.
   Phone companies want to reverse the 1984 Cable Act
provision that bars them from owning cable systems within
their territories. Phone companies say they can offer the
best check on skyrocketing cable fees: real competition.
   Meantime, the Bells want Congress to ease some of the
restraints of the consent decree that broke up AT&amp;T. The
decree bars them from many activities, including video
programming.
   The Bells could transmit movies and other video fare as a
common carrier, but programming is where the big money is.
The Bells contend that, without a financial interest in
programming, they couldn't justify the expense of fiber.
   "We need adequate earnings opportunities," says A. Gray
Collins, Bell Atlantic Corp.'s executive vice president of
external affairs. "The current form of regulation gives us no
reason to introduce new services and technology. We can't be
expected to build the network and not be allowed to benefit
from it." Without incentives, Mr. Collins says, many
customers won't get fiber until 2030 or so -- 20 years later
than is possible.
   But many consumer groups think the phone companies are
asking far too much. Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for
the Consumer Federation of America, points out that many
information services don't rely on fiber, such as the masses
of electronic information that already crisscross the globe
on copperwire. And he questions why phone companies should be
allowed to accelerate the deployment of fiber when consumers
aren't clamoring for the extra features. Mr. Kimmelman
believes fancy services that can be delivered only over fiber
optics will eventually evolve, but he thinks the phone
companies have greatly overestimated demand.
   "Why should we pay hundreds of billions of dollars to
accelerate investment when we already have an infrastructure
that can provide all these services?" asks Mr. Kimmelman.
"Fiber will come to the home when it is cost-effective."
   The Bells claim there is little time to lose. They say
that strategic competitors such as Japan, Germany and France
are gaining the advantage by aggressively installing fiber
optic networks.
   They worry that big corporations, the most lucrative
segment of the U.S. phone business, will continue to develop
their own networks -- which can be designed, built and
installed by foreign rivals.
   The U.S. companies also argue that foreign telephone
companies could end up with more sophisticated networks that
could process transactions faster. That would attract
financial services businesses and other
telecommunications-intensive industries away from the U.S.,
they say.
   Whether or not the U.S. gets in the game aggressively, Mr.
Smoot notes, fiber optics is on its way. "For the future,
what you're looking at is telepresence -- allowing me to be
where you are. Not just seeing you, but seeing all of the
things associated with you -- all the papers on the desk,
your PC, your whole environment," he says.
   "This is a wave that is not possible to stop."

   ALTHOUGH LIGHT and electricity travel at about the same
basic speed, voice and data messages can be transmitted much
faster through light than through electricity in copper
wires. The reason is the much greater bandwidth of light,
which permits far greater capacity. In last Tuesday's
edition, the comparison of speeds was oversimplified.
