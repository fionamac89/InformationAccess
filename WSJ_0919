   Says Moves to Ease Sales

   WASHINGTON -- A new analysis by the Resolution Trust Corp.
indicates that an attempt to squeeze savings from the
controversial 1988 sales of insolvent savings and loans could
provoke yet another bailout for these institutions.
   As much as $4 billion in excess costs could be trimmed
from 96 transactions through the prepayment of assistance and
exercise of certain contract options, according to the RTC,
which currently pegs the costs at $54 billion on a
present-value basis. Many of the transactions were sweetened
for investors at the expense of the Treasury, locking in
roughly $4.2 billion in tax benefits overall.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But if the RTC, the government's S&amp;L cleanup agency,
exercises contract options to reap those savings, it would
require about $22 billion in temporary cash, and the S&amp;L
bailout is already short of funds. Moreover, if the
government withdrew some of its assistance, as permitted
under the contracts, dozens of those S&amp;Ls will end up right
back at the government doorstep, insolvent and awaiting a new
round of government assistance to protect depositors.
   The sale of nearly 200 insolvent S&amp;Ls in 1988 has
increasingly stirred controversy as the soaring cost of the
S&amp;L excesses becomes clearer. Many Wall Street financiers,
including the Robert Bass Group, and Ronald Perelman's
holding company, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc., reaped
huge tax benefits. The S&amp;L cleanup law required the
regulators to look for ways to shrink some of the costs of
those sales.
   But exercising the options in all 96 sales would be a
huge, cash-draining process. The S&amp;L bailout is expected to
run dry of funds by year-end, unless Congress allocates
additional funds. Currently, spending for the S&amp;L cleanup is
ensnarled in the budget negotiations between Congress and the
Bush administration. "If they want to make savings, they have
to be willing to come up with this kind of money," warned RTC
Chairman William Seidman.
   Without an agreement to cut the budget deficit, it's not
clear whether Congress is willing to shake loose even
short-term money. Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.), who heads a
House task force on the RTC, said he favors spending cash to
lower overall costs, but isn't sure his colleagues will
agree. "There is a real temptation to get into a denial of
the issue," he said. "The administration is talking about
Iraq and pushing this as far away as they can."
   The funds, if approved, would be used to pay off
high-interest-bearing notes, and repurchase assets from the
S&amp;Ls in order to manage them more cheaply. For example, in
the Robert Bass Group acquisition of the thrift now known as
American Savings Bank, Stockton, Calif., $520 million could
be saved by prepaying an $8 billion assistance note to the
buyer.
   "That's fine with us," said a spokesman for the Robert
Bass Group. "We are perfectly willing to work with them." He
said that the institution has already sold $16.48 billion in
assets that drew government assistance, leaving roughly $4.9
billion in assets.
   The RTC could also write down the value of the
money-losing assets on the S&amp;L's books, which would reduce
the amount of government assistance in some cases. Some
institutions, numbering in the dozens, the RTC says, rely
heavily on the government assistance. "Some of those may be
in jeopardy," a spokesman for the RTC said. "It may make more
sense on a case-by-case basis to take no action rather than
create an insolvency."
   Mr. Seidman is discussing the report, and the government's
options, at a meeting tomorrow with the RTC's Oversight
Board. The RTC is also in the midst of another analysis of
the transactions, expected in November, which seeks to
determine if any of the deals might be overturned because of
any fraud or mismanagement associated with the transactions.

   Darling-Delaware
   Is Seeking Buyers,

   NEW YORK -- Darling-Delaware Co., which failed to make a
$12.2 million bond interest payment due last Saturday, is
seeking buyers for some or all of its operations, according
to the company's financial advisers.
   Last week, the Dallas-based rendering company told
bondholders that it needs to restructure its debt in light of
weak financial results so far this year. For 1990's first
half, the company had an $11.3 million loss on revenue of
$177.8 million. Darling-Delaware makes tallow and grease from
animal parts and restaurant waste.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If third parties are willing to put more capital into the
company, we're interested," said Bruce Raben, a Jefferies &amp;
Co. investment banker who is advising Darling-Delaware. Mr.
Raben said about 10 potential investors in Darling-Delaware
have approached the company. These range from regional U.S.
renderers interested in buying several plants to corporate
restructuring funds that might want an equity position in the
company, he said.
   Darling-Delaware on Saturday missed a semi-annual interest
payment due on its $175 million of 14% senior subordinated
debentures, which mature in 1999. These high-yield "junk"
bonds were issued in March 1989, shortly after
Darling-Delaware paid a $179 million dividend to a group of
Texas and Connecticut investors who own the company. The
bonds currently trade at about 25 cents on the dollar.
   Darling-Delaware also has about $110 million in bank debt
outstanding, owed to a syndicate of banks led by France's
Banque Paribas. Mr. Raben said the company is current on all
its bank interest payments. Paribas bankers didn't return
repeated phone calls.
   At a creditor's meeting last week, Darling Delaware's
current owners didn't make specific restructuring proposals,
said David Ying, an investment banker at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. who is advising the bondholders. Mr. Ying said
the company is asking bondholders for their suggestions -- an
unusual strategy for a company with debt problems.
   Messrs. Ying and Raben both said they expect that specific
restructuring proposals will surface in about 45 days.

other supplies in hopes of winning concessions during talks
designed to formally end the two countries' bitter eight-year
war. Moreover, Iran easily could conclude that its broader
interests are well-served by providing Iraq just enough
relief to keep the current Persian Gulf crisis bubbling along
unresolved until its Iraqi and American nemeses bloody each
other militarily.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Iran is likely to put distinct limits on any help. It
has little interest in giving so much aid that Iraq succeeds
in consolidating its hold on oil-rich Kuwait, thereby
becoming the clear power of the Persian Gulf and arbiter of
Gulf oil politics. And while Iran may not care about angering
the U.S. by embargo-busting, it probably doesn't want to
antagonize Europeans whose technical aid it wants.
   Some U.S. officials even suspect Iran is flirting with
embargo-busting as a way of extracting a payoff from Saudi
Arabia and other Gulf states opposed to Iraq.
   Iran's intentions have become important to U.S. policy,
because Tehran could provide Iraq significant economic relief
if it allows commerce to flow freely back and forth along the
countries' 750-mile border.
   American officials say they have little to go on but
indirect messages they have received from Iran through
diplomatic channels. These messages indicate that Iran
intends to abide by United Nations Security Council
resolutions banning trade with Iraq.
   Iran seems to have tactical reasons to allow some seepage
of goods to Iraq -- or to at least keep the West worrying
that it will do so. By simply hinting occasionally that it
may give Iraq some economic relief, Tehran can send the West
a clear reminder of its own strategically important location
and serve notice that the Gulf's future can't be decided
without taking Iran into account.
   Gary Sick, who was the chief Iranwatcher on President
Carter's National Security Council staff, says: "They will
use their embargo-busting as a bargaining chip with the
West."
   Iran's other tactical reasons for considering limited
embargo-busting arise from its complicated relations with
Iraq. In the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and subsequent
showdown with the international community, Saddam Hussein
last month appeared to accept Iran's terms for a formal peace
and he initiated negotiations on a treaty.
   In those negotiations, Iraq appears to have explicitly
offered to send Iran some of its refined oil products, which
Iran needs because of wartime damages to its refineries, in
return for shipments of food.
   Iran may want to play along for the time being. In
particular, Iran badly wants to win the return of thousands
of prisoners of war held by Iraq but who haven't been
registered with the Red Cross or returned home under initial
prisoner-of-war exchanges.
   In addition, Iran may want to stay on good terms with Iraq
long enough to get the Iraqi government to shut down offices
of Iranian opposition figures operating in Baghdad.
   But Iran's long-term interests suggest it won't want to
link itself closely with Iraq in an economic alliance opposed
by much of the outside world. While Iranian hard-liners
dislike U.S. policies in the Gulf, those same hard-liners
also have been the most virulently anti-Iraq elements in the
Iranian government.
   It also isn't clear that Iranian public opinion would
tolerate widespread aid to an Iraqi enemy that killed and
wounded tens of thousands of Iranians in recent years.
"Iranian public opinion would be scandalized by any show that
the Iranians are helping the Iraqis," says Shaul Bakhash, an
Iranian author and scholar now at George Mason University.
   Additionally, embargo-busting may not be a profitable
enterprise for the Iranians; Iraq, deeply in debt before the
Kuwaiti invasion and shut off from oil markets since, doesn't
have much material reward to offer Iran. "The profitability
of busting the embargo is questionable," says Robert Hormats,
vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.

   When John M. Hennessy was named chief executive of CS
First Boston Inc. last fall, he became the man charged with
making a success of the ballyhooed merger of First Boston
Corp. and its European affiliate. The combination was meant
to create the first "truly global" investment bank for the
1990s. Mr. Hennessy, a suave man with years of accomplishment
in Europe, would embody the new era.
   He seized the reins fast. Within a few months, he bumped
aside the newly named chief executive of CS First Boston's
big American unit, where profits were weak, to run the whole
show himself.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Then he rattled the U.S. unit, First Boston Corp. He axed
440 employees, or 10% of the work force. And, in a sweeping
move, he ousted the entire top tier of bond traders,
replacing them with a rough-and-tumble team of outsiders. The
latest management shift came Monday, when First Boston's head
of stock trading was forced to resign. The moves have created
turmoil in the ranks.
   But they haven't repaired the bottom line. First Boston's
total profits are stuck at a level far below those of rivals
Salomon Inc., Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co.
   Now the 54-year-old Mr. Hennessy clearly is under pressure
to produce. After a charmed 16-year career at First Boston,
Mr. Hennessy suddenly finds himself facing one of the
toughest turnaround jobs on Wall Street, as more people
question the wisdom of the merger that created CS First
Boston. Mr. Hennessy is "under the gun," says Lawrence
Eckenfelder, brokerage analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   Two weeks ago, just eight months after Mr. Hennessy took
over day-to-day control of the First Boston Corp. unit, he
surrendered that authority to Archibald Cox Jr., a man who
had worked for the firm for only four months.
   Last week, Mr. Hennessy's decision-making power was
further eroded. An internal memo said a committee of top
executives, including Hans-Joerg Rudloff, powerful head of
the European unit (Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston),
will meet more often and have more day-to-day say about how
CS First Boston is run.
   Is Mr. Hennessy in trouble? His bosses in Switzerland deny
it. "I have full confidence in Jack," says Rainer Gut,
chairman of Credit Suisse, which effectively controls CS
First Boston. "It was Jack who found Archie Cox with the
design of having him grow into a major role." Mr. Gut does
confirm Credit Suisse's displeasure with First Boston's
earnings, remarking that "they are probably as unhappy as we
are that they're not making better money."
   Mr. Hennessy himself says he never intended to run the
U.S. unit for long, although he acknowledges he told
employees when he shoved aside William Mayer as the unit's
chief that he could picture himself holding the post for as
long as two years. And some people on Wall Street say that
Mr. Hennessy has shrewdly elevated Mr. Cox, putting him in a
position of either fixing up First Boston or taking the blame
if he can't.
   Many of First Boston's troubles are clearly not of Mr.
Hennessy's doing. All along Wall Street, a slowdown in
business stemming from the October 1987 stock-market crash
has depressed securities underwriting and mergers and
acquisitions, costing many high executives their jobs.
   And just as Mr. Hennessy took over a year ago, the market
for junk bonds collapsed, plunging into turmoil the highly
leveraged retailing empire of First Boston client Robert
Campeau. The junk collapse left First Boston with big "bridge
loans" to corporate clients that couldn't be refinanced,
including $250 million to Campeau's troubled department
stores. In all, First Boston is stuck with a huge $1.1
billion in bridge loans -- the biggest exposure on Wall
Street.
   The aggressive Mr. Hennessy, fresh from a glittering
six-year stint in Europe, might seem just the person to cut
through this thicket. A square-jawed man who likes to call
himself "a tough Irish kid from Boston" -- he actually hails
from a suburb and is a Harvard graduate -- he decorates his
office with two fully outfitted statuettes of Samurai
warriors. Nearby, a plaque quotes a favorite verse that
begins: "People don't want to be managed. They want to be
led."
   But for all his forcefulness, critics fault Mr. Hennessy's
handling of some of First Boston's root problems. Meanwhile,
his tough, take-no-prisoners approach -- cutting staff,
criticizing performances and sometimes threatening to
"replace everyone" -- is taking a toll on morale.
   People had become "too comfortable" at First Boston during
the good years, Mr. Hennessy says. He suggests that any
grumbling in the ranks stems from people who can't cut it.
"Now it's tougher -- more like the Marines," he says.
   The problem is that First Boston seems to be pinned down
on the beach. Once an underwriting powerhouse, First Boston
has dropped in the rankings. It garnered only $89.5 million
in underwriting fees in this year's first half, down 22% from
a year before, a significantly steeper drop than on Wall
Street overall, according to Securities Data Co.
   And in private stock and bond placements, First Boston,
after leading all firms for two straight years, has stumbled
badly. Through June 30 it handled just $2.9 billion in
private placements, for a 5.2% market share and No. 7
ranking. That's down 62% from the $7.7 billion and 9.4%
market share in the year-earlier half, according to IDD
Information Services.
   First Boston isn't in the dire straits that Shearson
Lehman faced early this year, when Chairman Peter Cohen was
ousted. It has continued to thrive in big global merger
deals, for example. But last year CS First Boston recorded a
meager profit of just $11 million, while rival Salomon made
$470 million and Morgan Stanley $443 million; privately held
Goldman Sachs' profit is thought to have been comparable to
those.
   This year, CS First Boston's profit is up only slightly.
Holding it down is the need to continually set aside more
reserves for the huge backlog of bridge loans. CS First
Boston was forced to take more than $200 million in reserves
last year for bridge loans, and is taking a similar amount
this year under pressure from credit-rating agencies.
   The rating agencies don't rule out a future downgrade of
First Boston's debt if its bridge exposure isn't drastically
reduced. "They can't keep this crap on the books forever,"
says Jeffrey Bowman, vice president at Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. "We've been disappointed in the way the firm has tried
to work down their bridge-loan exposure. They should be more
aggressive."
   He adds: "Their direction is very short-term. I don't see
any long-term strategic plan yet."
   Says David C. Batten, a former CS First Boston managing
director who helped build the firm's capital-markets
business: "There have been no strategic initiatives in the
time Jack {Hennessy} has had the job -- yet the world has
changed dramatically." Mr. Batten, who quit First Boston
several months ago because of what he calls Mr. Hennessy's
lack of leadership, says: "No question that Jack inherited an
institution with real problems, but he's done very little to
shore up those problems."
   Others say Mr. Hennessy is trying to make the best of a
bad situation. Harvard Business School professor and Wall
Street watcher Samuel Hayes says the securities industry's
recession has undercut "a lot of different sectors {First
Boston has} depended on," including junk bonds and corporate
mergers. "So therefore it was inevitable there was going to
be a downturn in its fortunes."
   "I've always admired Jack Hennessy as a leader; he was the
one who turned around the operation in London and reaffirmed
their pre-eminence in that marketplace," Mr. Hayes says.
"It's hard for me to conclude that this is a problem that is
related to a lack of firm leadership," the professor says.
   Mr. Hennessy certainly hasn't been shy about shaking up
the firm. He replaced the top bond traders with a well-known
team led by William Voute and four others formerly with
Salomon Brothers. The bitterness among other First Boston
traders boiled over as one victim of the shakeup, David
Bunting, "retired" at age 47. As the former head
government-bond trader walked off First Boston's trading
floor, he was given a rousing standing ovation by other
traders. (First Boston says such ovations, at least small
ones, are a tradition.)
   But Mr. Hennessy has also alienated some top executives
with what they say is a Machiavellian management style. In
March, as the firm's results continued to slip, chief
financial officer John Toffolon Jr. walked into Mr.
Hennessy's 43rd-floor corner office to ask Mr. Hennessy if
his position was secure, associates say.
   Mr. Hennessy assured Mr. Toffolon he was doing a good job,
these people say. But at the same time, Mr. Hennessy told top
CS First Boston executives that he had lost confidence in Mr.
Toffolon and was actively looking to replace him. A few
months later, Mr. Toffolon resigned. He was replaced by
Shearson Lehman executive Robert Raziano, an expert in
payroll slashing. Messrs. Toffolon and Hennessy declined to
comment.
   Some employees say Mr. Hennessy has a habit -- they're not
sure whether it is intentional -- of sowing rumors and unrest
among his lieutenants. Out of earshot of an executive,
staffers say, he will remark that "I've been hearing" that
the person is in trouble or "doesn't have the confidence of
his people."
   Some top executives were taken aback at Mr. Hennessy's
behavior at an early-1989 meeting with a corporate-image
consultant and First Boston officials including then-chief
executive Peter Buchanan. Mr. Hennessy, though heir apparent,
wasn't yet in charge. But when Mr. Buchanan left the room,
say people who were there, Mr. Hennessy announced: "Don't
worry about what Peter has to say. His vote isn't going to
count."
   Mr. Hennessy denies saying such things. "That's not my
style," he says. "It wouldn't make any sense."
   Some First Boston executives accuse Mr. Hennessy of
scattershot execution of his game plan. Critics in the firm
say Mr. Hennessy rushed into the firm's newfound emphasis on
"relationship" banking, for instance. That's the old-style
Wall Street practice -- making a comeback at many investment
banks -- of forging strong ties with particular clients,
rather than chasing business opportunities as they arise.
   Mr. Hennessy says he hired Mr. Voute after the two men,
over drinks, got to talking about the renewed emphasis on
relationship banking. "Gee, it looks like the '60s," Mr.
Hennessy says Mr. Voute told him. Mr. Hennessy liked the ring
of that; Mr. Voute and his gang were hired.
   Still, with all the talk of relationship banking, there's
a hitch: Few First Boston executives have been on the road to
visit corporate clients at their offices all year, top First
Boston officials say.
   Associates of Mr. Hennessy say he has ignored pleas to
establish a world-wide strategy for stock trading. Top First
Boston officials have repeatedly told Mr. Hennessy the firm
needs to coordinate its equity activities around the globe,
including sizing up which markets look best, and where big
bets should be made. But he hasn't yet taken any action, the
executives say. Nor has he committed much of the firm's
capital in a significant way toward investing in "distressed"
securities in hopes of finding turnaround situations, as
other Wall Street firms have been doing.
   "We haven't taken full advantage of cross-border trading,
tying things all together," Mr. Hennessy concedes. But he
says Mr. Cox, with his equity expertise, is planning a
strategy for world-wide stock trading set to start Nov. 1.
(Mr. Cox will do it with a new First Boston equity-department
head, James Gantsoudes, a Dillon Read veteran who Monday
replaced the ousted Curtis Welling.)
   As for distressed securities, Mr. Hennessy says the firm
has been hesitant to commit much money to it because of its
heavy bridge-loan exposure. "We're staying fairly close to
shore on that," he says. But he contends the firm has made
money trading in such securities, adding: "We're making
continuous bets, but not huge bets."
   There is another source of friction Mr. Hennessy still
must find a way to bridge: the longstanding schism between CS
First Boston investment bankers on either side of the
Atlantic. Mr. Hennessy's relationship with the aggressive Mr.
Rudloff in Europe remains competitive.
   A New York-based managing director focusing on
international business, Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, says he saw
opportunities for the firm in Eastern Europe late last year.
Mr. Kuczynski had initial success in Hungary, helping take
the state-run Malev airline private, but he suddenly pulled
back from the rest of the region after Mr. Rudloff made it
known that his people were running the entire European show.
"He wanted his own team," says Mr. Kuczynski.
   Mr. Rudloff is feared in New York. Executives there were
buzzing last week over comments made by Mr. Rudloff after the
internal announcement of the beefed-up executive committee.
Credit Suisse is a "well-oiled machine," Mr. Rudloff said in
a Reuters wire-service report from London. But "our cousins
in New York may need a little more attention." A startled Mr.
Hennessy complained to Mr. Rudloff in a phone call from his
office: "Hans-Joerg, I would have put it differently."
   Last year, the First Boston Corp. unit in the U.S. didn't
make money, but the European operation did. That's something
the Europeans make sure the New Yorkers don't easily forget.
   Mr. Hennessy says the firm's overall performance is the
important thing. "We're like Ford," he says. "Right now, Ford
USA isn't doing as well as Ford Europe. And that's the same
here."
   But what startled many employees about the internal
announcement was Mr. Hennessy's apparent defensiveness about
his power. "Decisions will be made by consensus," Mr.
Hennessy said, "but I will retain the ultimate power of
decision."
   First Boston's new chief, Mr. Cox -- an old friend of Mr.
Gut, the Credit Suisse chairman, from their days commuting to
New York together on the Long Island Rail Road -- is seen on
Wall Street as a warmer figure than Mr. Hennessy. The
6-foot-7 Mr. Cox was known for plopping down in the middle of
the trading room to chat when he was head of Morgan Stanley's
international operations in London. After first joining CS
First Boston earlier this year, he helped map a three-year
strategy aiming for a return on equity of 20%. (Morgan
Stanley has averaged a 31% return the past five years.)
   Mr. Hennessy says he is unconcerned about whether his own
job could be on the line. "I'm not worried, it doesn't affect
me," he says. "Push me out, kick me upstairs, whatever," he
adds, holding his hand over his heart and smiling. "I can now
relax, frankly, because we have a team in place that's
certainly the best in the business."

   TOKYO -- Six months after pledging to form a global
business alliance, Japan's Mitsubishi Group and West
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG are expected to approve the first
joint projects here today.
   The agenda for the first top-level meeting since March
between the huge industrial groups could include small-scale
automobile- and part-making ventures in the East bloc,
aerospace development, and an aircraft-leasing partnership.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Officially, a Daimler spokesman said, Chairman Edzard
Reuter and other officials are in Japan primarily to mark the
listing of the company's stock on the Tokyo exchange. "We
don't expect any concrete agreements," the spokesman said.
And a spokesman for Mitsubishi Corp., the trading company at
the heart of the industrial group, said there was "no
specified agenda."
   The most concrete plans appear to center on cooperation
between Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Daimler-Benz. The two
companies already cooperate in some businesses. Mitsubishi
officials have said that Daimler-Benz has asked the Japanese
to supply equipment and construction for an auto plant in the
Soviet Union, and to provide technology for a small-truck
plant to be built in East Germany.
   One of the most closely watched areas of the emerging
alliance is aerospace, where Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
is trying to build expertise. Both groups have floated ideas
for cooperation. Daimler-Benz hinted it might invite
Mitsubishi to participate in a planned aircraft-engine
manufacturing venture with the Pratt &amp; Whitney subsidiary of
United Technologies Corp. And Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
said it would seek to cooperate in developing a 75-seat
passenger plane.
   Those moves worry some American industry and government
officials, who fear that the Japanese are beginning to loosen
their exclusive relationship with U.S. aerospace companies.
   Japanese newspapers also have reported that Mitsubishi and
Daimler are considering a tie-up with Ireland's GPA Ltd., the
world's largest aircraft-leasing firm. Mitsubishi has a seat
on the GPA board, reflecting its 15% equity ownership. But
the Mitsubishi spokesman said he "cannot confirm such
speculative stories." In Shannon, GPA declined to comment.

   TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said it will reorganize its
sales units in Belgium to create a wholly owned subsidiary to
strengthen European sales operations.
   The new unit, Toyota Motor Europe Marketing &amp; Engineering

million). Toyota's existing subsidiary in Brussels and its

   From the opinion of Judge Stanley Sporkin in Lincoln
Savings and Loan v. Office of Thrift Supervision:

<TEXT>
   This is a saga that demonstrates the excesses of a
misconceived and misapplied regulatory program along with a
group of individuals who were bent on exploiting these
excesses, all to the detriment and ultimate demise of
Lincoln. It is abundantly clear that Lincoln was in an unsafe
and unsound condition to transact business and that
plaintiffs did in fact engage in numerous unsafe and unsound
banking practices. Accordingly, this Court concludes that the
Bank Board acted properly in placing Lincoln first in
conservatorship and then in receivership.
   The Bank Board's case is fairly straightforward. It
asserts that Lincoln engaged in a number of imprudent
transactions in order to improperly upstream monies to ACC,
its parent, which was experiencing financial difficulties.
                                                                                                       

   The Tax Sharing Agreement
                                                                                                       

   The Bank Board is absolutely correct in its analysis of
the tax sharing agreement. Under the tax sharing agreement,
Lincoln transferred to ACC over $94 million in so-called tax
sharing payments when in fact Lincoln on a stand-alone basis
essentially owed no taxes. Plaintiffs used the concept of tax
sharing as a way of dipping into Lincoln's coffers and taking
money which under no circumstances were plaintiffs entitled
to have. Although ACC owned 100% of the stock of Lincoln,
this did not give ACC license to strip Lincoln of its funds,
particularly because the funds upstreamed emanated from the
savings of individual investors which were insured up to
$100,000 per account by the Federal Government.
   But there is much more skullduggery that has taken place
in this case. The tax sharing agreement was merely the
mechanism used to permit the impermissible taking that
occurred. What the defendant has next alleged and proven is
that the plaintiffs engaged in additional unsafe and unsound
practices for the purpose of creating bogus profits in order
to justify the remittance of monies from Lincoln to ACC under
the "tax sharing agreement."
   The main purpose of certain of these transactions was to
create paper profits in order to "window dress" the financial
statements of Lincoln and its parent ACC and to provide the
accounting basis for the upstreaming of funds from Lincoln to
ACC.
                                                                                                       

   The Wescon Transaction
                                                                                                       

   The evidence shows that on March 31, 1987, a Lincoln
subsidiary sold 1,000 acres of raw land in Hidden Valley to a
company called West Continental Mortgage and Investment
Corporation (Wescon). The terms of the sale involved a cash
down payment of $3.5 million, along with a nonrecourse note
for the balance of $10.5 million for a total sales price of
$14 million.
   Since Lincoln's pro rata cost of the property sold was
only $3 million, it was able to book a gain of $11 million
along with $250,000 in accrued interest. In accordance with
the "tax sharing agreement," ACC was able to upstream to
itself from Lincoln $4.4 million, or 40% of the $11 million
gain.
   Wescon never made a payment against the balance on the
outstanding note. Wescon was a company of little means. It
had a net worth of only $31,000, and it really had no
intention of developing the property. Fernando Acosta, the
President of Wescon, was quite blunt in his testimony at the
hearing. He stated that his company was acting only as a
"straw" for Mr. Garcia, the head of E.C. Garcia &amp; Company.
   It is clear, and this Court finds, that the sole reason
for the Wescon transaction was to enable the ACC complex to
record an $11 million profit and thus allow ACC to improperly
take $4.4 million from Lincoln. Here we have a sham
transaction from the start with the identity of the real
party in interest being shielded from those who must exercise
appropriate oversight of the transaction. Because of the use
of a straw buyer the accounting audit trail does not disclose
all the salient points associated with the transaction.
   Moreover, when the entire series of transactions between
the Garcia and ACC complex of companies is reviewed, it
emerges that in fact the money for the down payment actually
emanated from Lincoln itself.
                                                                                                       

   The Philip Gordon Transaction
                                                                                                       

   Here, the transaction involved an exchange of like
property and as such it is inappropriate to recognize a gain.
   This is another example of ACC officials crafting
transactions for the sole purpose of being able to book and
record paper profits and upstream monies from Lincoln to ACC.
The Court rejects ACC's feeble attempt to attribute a valid
business purpose to this set of transactions. The record is
clear that the transactions involved a flat-out exchange of
property at inflated prices for which no gain should have
been recognized and no tax payment made by Lincoln to ACC.
   The Wescon and Gordon "sales" represent only two of ten
"creative" transactions involving Hidden Valley parcels. In
total, the ten sales resulted in the booking by Lincoln of
$82 million in net income of 68% of Lincoln's total 1986-1988
pre-tax income of $120.8 million. Under the tax sharing
agreement by applying the 40% tax rate, ACC was able to
appropriate (42) to itself from Lincoln almost $33 million in
cash from these transactions.
                                                                                                       

   Conclusions of Law
                                                                                                       

   Because of the interests at stake in this case plaintiffs'
allegations of an impermissible constitutional taking of
plaintiffs' property, the Court permitted the parties the
widest latitude to develop a full and complete record. What
has emerged is not a pretty picture. It is abundantly clear
that ACC's officials abused their positions with respect to
Lincoln. Bluntly speaking, their actions amounted to a
looting of Lincoln. This was not done crudely. Indeed, it was
done with a great deal of sophistication. The transactions
were all made to have an aura of legality about them. They
even entered into a so-called formal tax sharing agreement in
order to claim they had the approval of the regulatory
authorities for this phase of their illicit activities.

   NEW YORK -- Responding to stiff competition, TV Guide will
publish two editions of its weekly magazine designed
specifically for Manhattan cable subscribers.
   The special TV Guides, to begin publishing Nov. 3, will be
sent to current subscribers who live in the Manhattan Cable
and Paragon franchise areas. They will also be available on
newsstands in the franchise areas of the two systems, along
with the existing New York Metro edition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The editions are part of a new effort by Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp., which acquired TV Guide two years ago, to turn
around the declining fortunes of the television-listings
magazine. The two new editions, which include detailed
program listings and channel locations of cable programs in
each cable system, compete directly with currently produced
local guides.
   TV Guide launched its first special cable edition in 1986
for cable subscribers in the New York boroughs of Queens,
Brooklyn and Staten Island. Since then, it has introduced
customized editions in several other cities.

   NEW YORK -- McGraw-Hill Inc.'s F.W. Dodge division and
Publications du Moniteur, a subsidiary of CEP Communications
S.A., Paris, agreed to launch a service to supply information
on European construction.
   The new Pan European Construction Service will provide
detailed printed information on all major new construction
projects in Europe that construction and building-products
companies bid on, a spokesman for Dodge said. The service
will link seven major European providers of
construction-project news.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Start-up costs will be minimal, the spokesman said,
because the two services must only reroute their current flow
of information to subscribers in different countries. The new
service is expected to be available to an unspecified number
of subscribers by the fall of 1991. Subscribers will pay $500
to $50,000 annually for the service, he said.
   Through F.W. Dodge, McGraw-Hill is a major provider of
construction-project news in the U.S. Its Dodge Europe
division has similar activities in Europe.
   Publications du Moniteur's weekly Le Moniteur is a leading
European construction-project publication in France and Spain
with a circulation of 75,000, according to McGraw-Hill.

   Next Inc. Introduces Three Computers,
   Surprising Industry With Low Pricing

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Next Inc., searching for a way to break
into the computer industry mainstream, introduced three
powerful and aggressively priced computers.
   Next Chief Executive Stephen P. Jobs, best known as
co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., hopes Next's
second-generation products will ignite the five-year-old
company. Its original computer, released two years ago, was
roundly criticized and sold poorly, but the new models, which
are driven by one of the fastest computer chips on the
market, appear likely to win a warmer reception. The original
model was pulled quietly from the market in May, underscoring
the importance of the new machines for the company's
survival.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They are extremely attractive," said Ramy Goldstein, vice
president, equity financial strategies at First Boston Co.,
which is buying 100 of the new computers and expects to
purchase hundreds more in the coming year.
   Next said it has received orders for 15,000 of its
computers, which observers estimate is roughly double the
sales of its original model. The model with a black-and-white
monitor costs $4,995. The model with a color monitor costs
$7,995 and will be available early next year. The
black-and-white model, which Next said it will start shipping
in November, comes with a 68040 microprocessor, Motorola
Inc.'s latest and fastest microprocessor. A third model,
which won't be available until early 1991, starts at about
$12,000 and comes with a souped-up color monitor capable of
displaying live video or television.
   The aggressive pricing surprised observers, but Mr. Jobs
indicated that he doesn't want to see a replay of the
reception given his original Next computer, which came only
with a black-and-white monitor and sold to corporations for
nearly $10,000 and to universities for somewhat less.
   Mr. Jobs acknowledged that Next's first computer was "too
slow, too expensive, lacked {software} applications" and a
color monitor. In January, amid reports of the computer's
dismal reception, Mr. Jobs stepped up work on the new line.
"We decided we had to address all these {shortcomings} this
year," Mr. Jobs said.
   Mr. Jobs received significant help from Lotus Development
Corp., which yesterday unveiled a spreadsheet for Next's
computers. The program, called Improv, isn't modeled on
Lotus's 1-2-3 family of spreadsheets, but can exchange data
with 1-2-3 programs.
   Mr. Jobs contends that Next's unique operating software,
which combines a version of Unix with a series of screen
commands called Nextstep, shortens the time required to
create new software for Next computers.
   Many customers agree, but they note that there still isn't
as much software available on Next machines as on some
competitors' models. And there is a fear that owners of Next
computers will be stuck with Nextstep should Next's newest
products flounder and the company's survival come into
question.
   "Those are my two big worries, the proprietary nature of
Nextstep and Next's corporate viability," said Mr. Goldstein
of First Boston. He says he has contingency plans in the
event of Next's demise.
   Mr. Jobs argues that Nextstep isn't proprietary because
International Business Machines Co. has licensed it for use
with the company's line of workstations. But Mr. Goldstein
said IBM's version of Nextstep is still an unknown because it
hasn't been introduced.
   Even armed with stronger products, Mr. Jobs faces a
difficult time winning market share against the likes of Sun
Microsystems Inc., IBM and Apple, which is expected to
introduce a Macintosh powered by a 68040 chip early next
year.
   Observers say Next is likely to make inroads into narrow
markets for computers in the near-term and that it will take
another round of products, perhaps to come as early as next
year, before Next can challenge the industry's leaders. "I
think people with specialized needs are going to buy it,"
said Walter D. Feigenson, director, special projects at
Ashton-Tate Corp., which released a spreadsheet for Next's
computers earlier this month. "Let's not forget that the
Macintosh took a long time to establish itself, too."

   Some Consultants Cash In on the Yen to Get Even

   It's the American way: If there's a demand for a product
or service, there's bound to be an entrepreneur trying to
cash in. These days, revenge is no exception.
   Lesa Patrock says she never dreamed she would be using her
college degree in psychology and sociology to help others
plot revenge. Ms. Patrock, who runs the Dudley, Mass.-based
Local Revenge, says she spends most of her time on the
telephone with potential clients listening to them bare their
souls. Often, it's only after two, three or sometimes even
four such conversations that clients are ready to take the
plunge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We do dirty deeds, not obscene things. Ones that get the
point across," says Ms. Patrock. People are often so angry
that they want to "flatten someone's tires or take their keys
down the side of someone's car," Ms. Patrock says. She
encourages them to spend their money, time and effort doing
something "cute" that still sends a message.
   For example, Ms. Patrock says she told an insurance
salesman's co-workers, who frequently had to cover for the
salesman when he was late for appointments, to rib him by
buying him a watch and an appointment book.
   For a $35 fee plus reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred while carrying out the act of revenge, Ms.
Patrock will deliver a specially tailored "revenge package"
to the client's chosen victim. One order came from a
secretary whose boss filled her days with menial tasks, such
as making the perfect cup of coffee and photocopying
seemingly endless pages of material. The package for her
boss, presented while others in the office looked on,
included the coffee cup, utensils, milk and sugar that he
would need to take care of his coffee himself -- along with
50 copies of her resignation letter, complete with a long
list of her complaints.
   In New York, there is Alan Abel, who touts himself as a
"Master of Retaliation." He is well known for engineering
media hoaxes, including the fake winner of a $35 million New
York lottery last January. For $25 for a 2 1/2-hour session,
far less than the fee likely to be charged for a comparable
visit with a therapist, anyone suffering from an
uncontrollable desire to exact revenge can sign up for Mr.
Abel's self-help class: "Don't Get Mad, Get Even."
   Mr. Abel figures that over the four years he has taught
the class at the Discovery Center in New York, he has
instructed about 1,200 students in the art of retaliation.
The students have ranged from doctors, lawyers, accountants
and financial analysts to undertakers, opera singers, belly
dancers and animal trainers. Their motivations have varied.
But high on the list, apart from wanting to settle the score
for a romantic relationship gone bad, is the desire to get
even with someone at work.
   "It's better to give ulcers than to get them," says Mr.
Abel, who in addition to his monthly classroom sessions,
provides his services through private consultations and a
manual that outlines 100 of his tried-and-true techniques.
   Among his suggestions: To embarrass the chain smoker in
the office, leave the smoke alarm on his or her desk. To send
a warning signal to the person who gives everybody a hard
time, leave a loudly ticking alarm clock in a gift-wrapped
box on that person's desk. And to stop a co-worker from
sticking his fingers in the petty cash, sending personal mail
through the company mail room and taking office supplies
home, send a note to the Internal Revenue Service suggesting
that this person might be running his own business on the
side and not declaring it on his taxes.
   Despite approaching his work with a sense of humor and the
bent of a practical joker, however, Mr. Abel would be among
the first to admit that revenge isn't always a laughing
matter.
   "The thesis I teach in class is that all of us want just a
little more space in life; we want what we paid for," Mr.
Abel says. "But there are a lot of piranhas and vultures
hovering around. So, sometimes you have to be a bit deceptive
to get what you want."

   MILWAUKEE -- Badger Meter Inc. said holders approved a
plan that allows the company's officers and directors to
purchase its Class B shares, which have enhanced voting
rights.
   Previously, only eight holders could buy Class B shares as
they became available. The change raises the total to 25. The
maker of flow-measurement products said the Class B stock has
10 votes a share, while the company's common has one vote a
share. The company said that as of Aug. 24, it had 562,785
Class B shares and 1,105,042 common shares outstanding.
Badger said the move is consistent with its plans to boost
employee ownership, raise cash and retain officers and
directors.

   EMBARRASSING? Alarming? Whatever you call it, initial
results of a much-touted program to draw some of the best
students into manufacturing are revealing.
   Two years ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and 11 major manufacturers began a five-year, $46 million
effort to educate a new generation of manufacturing leaders.
The first class of 20 Fellows just finished the two-year
program.
   So where did they land? A startling 35% went with
consulting firms -- not manufacturers; McKinsey &amp; Co. landed
three.
   Money appears to be the principal factor. The median
starting salary for those who went with consultants was
$70,000, while for those opting for manufacturing concerns,
it was $55,000. Just nine of the students went with
sponsoring companies, including Digital Equipment (which
hired three) and Motorola (two).
   "To some, this may be discouraging news," says Linda
Stantial, career-development director of MIT's Sloan School
of Management. She notes that several students who chose
consulting will deal with factory issues.
   The results jolted the sponsors. Some of the companies
"think that if they're putting in this kind of money, they
should have some of these students," says Thomas W. Eagar, a
professor in the program. "But these aren't indentured
servants."
   MIT has begun hammering the message that Fellows are
expected to join manufacturers. And future Fellows may not
get a free ride but a loan that wouldn't have to be repaid if
they join a manufacturer. Sponsoring companies are expected
to send as Fellows more of their own engineers, who likely
would return.
   Among the students, many believe "manufacturers will have
to narrow the pay gap to entice them," says one Fellow. Ms.
Stantial contends manufacturers face a "tough challenge"
ahead to "potentially change their career paths, compensation
schemes and organization attitudes . . . their corporate
culture."
                                                                                                       

   Eager to Boost Morale?
   Just Spin the Wheel
                                                                                                       

   MEDIATECH, a Chicago company that duplicates
videocassettes, has tried with mixed success the traditional
methods for motivating employees, including contests and
parties. Officials believe they have hit a winner for
improving morale: the corporate lottery.
   Unlike in state lotteries, Mediatech's 350 employees don't
risk their own money. The company puts $250 weekly into the
prize pot. Each Monday, a wheel is spun to determine if there
will be a lottery that week. If the wheel stops on Lottery,
the drawing is at 4 p.m. Friday with payroll check numbers
used to pick winners; if No Lottery comes up, the money
accumulates until the next week.
   Mediatech officials claim the 16-week-old lottery has
greatly improved morale and productivity. "Certainly,
attendance is better on Friday afternoons," says Sterling
"Red" Quinlan, a Mediatech vice president.
                                                                                                       

   Retiree Benefit Cuts
   Won't End Soon
                                                                                                       

   RETIREES, take note. You haven't seen anything yet in the
rush by employers to shift more of their health-care cost
burden to retirees. An unpublished study by Hewitt Associates
suggests that over the next five years, a growing number of
companies plan to take far more serious actions to stem
mounting retiree health costs than steps taken in the past
two years.
   By 1995, 62% of 463 large and medium-sized firms surveyed
by the Lincolnshire, Ill., benefits consulting firm say they
will "definitely consider" raising insurance-premium
contributions of retirees, and one in 20 will mull
eliminating the retiree medical plan altogether. During the
past two years, about 35% of the companies raised the premium
contribution, but few terminated plans altogether.

   IT'S NO SECRET that when work-family conflicts arise,
working mothers shoulder most of the responsibilities. A
fresh Labor Department survey underscores just how much of
the burden working women continue to bear, despite all the
talk of changing gender roles in society.
   During an average week last year, 6.6% of married women
employed full time missed work. That was considerably above
the 4% absence rate for men. The gap is much wider for
working couples with children under 17 years old. Among
working mothers with preschoolers, the rate was 11.5%, triple
the 3.8% rate for their spouses. For couples with children
aged 6 to 17, the rate was 6% for women, 3.7% for men.
   The survey also indicates that when working women with
preschoolers miss work, the odds are nearly 2-to-1 that the
reason isn't their own illness. These mothers are most likely
to encounter scheduling problems with child-care
arrangements.
   In contrast, when their spouses miss work, the odds are
6-to-4 that it is because they are ill and not because they
are staying home with a sick child.

   Who's News:
   Maxwell to Retire as Fannie Mae Chief;
   Vice Chairman Johnson to Succeed Him

   WASHINGTON -- David Maxwell, who led the Federal National
Mortgage Association's dramatic turnaround, plans to retire
Jan. 31, and James Johnson, who joined Fannie Mae in January
as vice chairman, will step up as chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Mr. Maxwell, 60 years old, will be retiring one day shy of
his 10th anniversary at Fannie Mae. "I've always felt that 10
years is about the right amount of time for a CEO of a large
corporation to serve if he or she has fulfilled goals set out
at the beginning," he told a press conference yesterday. When
Mr. Maxwell took charge in 1981, Fannie Mae was a basket
case, losing $190.4 million that year. Last year, the company
reported net income of $807 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fannie Mae -- a government-sponsored, publicly traded
company -- buys mortgages from lenders, packages some into
securities for sale to investors and holds the rest in its
portfolio. Last year, its assets climbed to $124 billion.
   Mr. Maxwell's efforts to strengthen the company's
management and operations have won wide praise among analysts
and investors. And Mr. Johnson, 46, isn't expected to bring
any major change in philosophy or management style. Both men
are known as bright, intense and politically savvy managers.
Another stabilizing force, Roger Birk, Fannie Mae's president
and chief operating officer, said he will remain with the
company, and industry sources believe he will stay on for at
least a year. Mr. Birk, a few months younger than Mr.
Maxwell, had been chairman and chief executive of Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., before joining Fannie Mae in 1987.
   Mr. Johnson also brings to the top job Wall Street
experience, having been a managing director at Shearson
Lehman Hutton since 1985, before joining Fannie Mae last Jan.
1. He is well-connected in Washington, having been president
of a Washington consulting firm and serving as executive
assistant to Vice President Walter Mondale and chairman of
Mr. Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign.
   "I don't think Jim Johnson will skip a beat," said Robert
Hottensen, an analyst with Goldman, &amp; Sachs Co. "I think that
David Maxwell has done two outstanding things: He has set the
tone for the company's strong competitive position and has
built one of the outstanding management teams in the mortgage
finance business."
   For his part, Mr. Johnson said he expects to continue
Fannie Mae's commitments, including managing interest rates
and credit risk, helping to solve the nation's housing
problems and providing first-rate customer service.
   Fannie Mae's stock closed at $27.50, down $1.50, yesterday
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Cambodian Dancers on Tour

   Los Angeles -- The choice of the site may have been
pragmatic -- a pleasant outdoor venue close to the freeways
-- but the symbolism seemed sublime. Here was the Classical
Dance Company of Cambodia, a superb young troupe that has
flowered from the devastation of the killing fields,
performing on the grounds of the Arboretum, a place of
institutionalized blossoming.
   Dancers' fingers unfurled like petals in time-lapse
photography. Dreamlike ballets unfolded on a bare stage: a
goddess and her handmaidens in a heavenly garden; a demon
disguised as a golden deer; a chaotic battle at night between
the hideously masked forces of evil and a trio of monkeys,
who were not only the good guys but the comics, scratching
their fleas and flinging themselves around in
lighter-than-air cartwheels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In reality, or rather in a glittering unreality that the
company sustained with nearly flawless concentration, the
stage didn't seem bare at all, but somehow graced by scenic
traces of royal courts, verdant forests and lush rice
paddies. And in that same unreality, it seemed as if these
dancers, with their towering headdresses, sumptuously
sequined costumes and radiant smiles, were the embodiments of
a cultural tradition that had been passed down to them,
through the long centuries, serene and undisturbed.
   Nothing could be further from the truth. Cambodia's
culture, along with much of its population, was murdered by
Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge regime during a four-year reign
of terror in the late 1970s, and many of these dancers were
malnourished orphans. When reconstruction began in 1980, the
nation's most urgent needs were food and shelter. Yet a new
School of Fine Arts opened during the same year in the
capital, Phnom Penh; this dance company is one of the
school's near-miraculous products.
   Its appearance here last week, as the crowning glory of a
delightful, if sometimes chaotic, Los Angeles Festival,
marked the first artistic exchange between the U.S. and
Cambodia since the Vietnam War. It also bespoke a remarkable
willingness on the part of the Vietnam-backed government of
Cambodia to support an art form that is elitist, to say the
least, and of royal descent; in olden days, court dancers did
double duty in the harem.
   The troupe's artistic director, 42-year-old Proeung
Chhieng, survived the terror as a farmer on a
concentration-camp farm, but both of his parents and 12 of
his 13 brothers and sisters were killed by the Khmer Rouge.
When I talked with Mr. Chhieng, I learned that dwelling on
the horrors of the past is not his style. Deflecting all
questions about life under the Pol Pot regime, he declared
himself delighted that his 36-person company had made it to
these shores, and had been received with open arms -- plus
gifts of food, money and warm clothing for the rest of the
tour -- by this city's large Cambodian community.
   Blowing his own horn isn't his style either. "I'm just a
grain of sand in the Sahara," he insisted earnestly. Then he
added that he'd been deeply troubled by the headline above an
article about him that ran on this page two months ago. And
what was the offending head? "The Man Who Saved Cambodian
Dance."
   "No one person could have done that," he said. "What we
have accomplished over the past 10 years is the work of so
many, many people together."
   Whether or not the editor's headline overstated Mr.
Chhieng's role, the article itself, written by Eileen
Blumenthal, a Rutgers professor of theater arts, amply
documented his dedication, from the time he was a child star,
living in the royal palace and dancing monkey roles, to his
first visit to New York earlier this year, in advance of the
company's tour.
   The only problem with the piece was that it never quite
explained how Mr. Chhieng or his company got here, since the
writer left out her own crucial role. When I talked with Ms.
Blumenthal, who has become the de facto producer of the tour,
I learned that her own dedication to classical Cambodian
dance began almost seven years ago, when she saw some shaky
amateurs going through the motions here in L.A. "It was clear
from their performance that whatever the tradition was, they
weren't able to maintain it," she says. "Still, I thought
this was a moving story, the destruction of an ancient
culture, and I decided to follow it up."
   That meant connecting with the Cambodian refugee
community, studying the culture, watching dances being taught
by aging teachers, and finally parlaying her academic
credentials into several visits to Cambodia, which had all
but excluded American citizens, including journalists, since
the Vietnam War.
   What she found, to her astonishment, was not the
destruction of a culture at all, but a small group of
surviving artists and teachers who were literally unearthing
precious traditions, passing them on to young students, and
thereby restoring them to the living stage.
   On her return to the U.S., Ms. Blumenthal spread the word
of her discoveries by writing newspaper and magazine
articles, and showing videotapes of the wonderful dance
troupe in Phnom Penh to some of this country's cultural
commissars. One result was an invitation to the troupe from
the Los Angeles Festival, followed by another invitation from
the Kennedy Center, followed by additional bookings and a
providential flurry of funds. "For a change," Ms. Blumenthal
said, "the gods decided they'd done enough to Cambodia, and
just for once they'd make everything work."
   Almost everything. Visas were slow to come from the U.S.
State Department, whose Cambodian policy remains in flux.
During two cliffhanging days late last month, the L.A.
Festival found itself squeezed between a charter airline,
which wanted advance payment for flying the dance company
from Phnom Penh to Bangkok, and the State Department, which
hadn't yet come through with the troupe's visas. Ten days
before the company opened here, the festival still was
worrying, via FAX, whether it could afford such an elaborate
event.
   Eventually, of course, the visas materialized, most of the
money did too (though one of the festival's checks briefly
bounced), and the artists wove their spell. In a festival
that celebrated far-flung cultures, the Cambodian dancers
served as a mesmerizing reminder that art is what some people
live for, and die for.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Bookshelf:
   Touring the Gallic Mind and Countryside

   France, for the past three centuries, has fascinated the
world. From the refinements of Versailles to the last word in
bloody revolution, from high fashion to high-tech in the
shape of the world's fastest train, it has proved
unpredictable, but interesting. And then, there is that
famous way of life, happily blending -- so we are often told
-- sexual liberation and gastronomical bliss.
   None of this has escaped Richard Bernstein. The former
head of the Paris bureau of the New York Times, Mr. Bernstein
was not only interested in France and the French, he also had
access to people and places well beyond the ordinary
traveler's ken; and the result, surprisingly, is a hymn of
love. Of course, like the good journalist he is, Mr.
Bernstein retains his objectivity: Shortcomings are listed as
well as achievements; the peculiarities of the French
political system -- essentially an elective monarchy -- are
carefully analyzed; and the descriptions of the French on
holiday are enough to make the blood run cold.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still, "Fragile Glory: A Portrait of France and the
French" (Knopf, 349 pages, $24.95) is a paean to the
landscapes, the villages, the traditions and the people of
France. Better yet, Mr. Bernstein set out to disprove a myth
he encountered early. "The French," he notes, "like to think
of themselves as just a bit inscrutable, especially to
outsiders." He shows us just how the French differ from one
another and from us, and why.
   The place to start, contrary to tradition, is not Paris.
Most Parisians, still today, have roots deep in the
countryside; and Mr. Bernstein's summary of "la France
Profonde" (deep France) is nothing short of superb as he
takes us around the country, from village to village and
region to region. His descriptions of the landscape often
verge on the lyrical: "The Luberon Valley in Provence," he
writes, "is an arid region of pastel colors, of mottled pink
land, of olive and fig groves and vineyards that turn scarlet
in the autumn, the ensemble of colors mingling harmoniously
like those on the printed cotton cloth manufactured in the
region." Even better, he then goes on to interview and
observe people with a mixture of sympathy and detachment; and
the conversations he has with farmers and town dwellers alike
combine to offer the reader an unusually vivid and precise
picture of rural France.
   The same is true of Paris. But while Mr. Bernstein's
fondness for the city is evident, he does not allow it to
sway him. "In some ways, Paris's long moment has finally
passed," he writes, accurately, as he goes on to note the
city's lack of "creative audacity." And when it comes to
judging its intellectuals and their productions, he is quite
rightly pitiless, mentioning, among other factors, the
importance of subjects the French themselves call
"franco-francais", Franco-French -- i.e., of no interest to
anyone anywhere else.
   All this, however, just sets the scene: From there, the
book goes on to the French character, with its sometimes
appealing, sometimes maddening characteristics. What Mr.
Bernstein calls the "R5 complex" (after the small Renault) is
a hair-raising description and a brilliant analysis of the
Jekyll-and-Hyde-like transformation the French undergo when
driving a car. "Gallic Shrugs" offers a sharp and amusing
account of French manners. "In Praise of Frivolity" is a
mouthwatering trip through all the good things (to eat and
otherwise) to be found in France. And in passing, Mr.
Bernstein dispels a few myths, among which the best known is
that the French are anti-American. In fact, as he accurately
points out, the French now are frantically pro-American and
prove it constantly, imitation being the sincerest form of
worship.
   Nor is the dark side of French politics ignored: There is
a substantial chapter on the "political class" and the
population's relationship to it, a compound of respect,
cynicism and outright derision. Add to that Mr. Bernstein's
explanation of the role played by the few hundred graduates
of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, and the frequent
lack of responsiveness of the government to its own people
becomes clear; so does its tendency to continue its mistakes
well past the point of absurdity.
   Darker subjects are tackled as well: the continuing role
of "raison d'Etat", for instance, the "reason of State" which
enables the government to get away with a variety of scandals
in the name of national security: The sinking of the Rainbow
Warrior, the anti-nuclear Greenpeace ship bombed in Auckland
by the French secret services, is a perfect case in point.
And, of course, Mr. Bernstein discusses the rise of racism as
sponsored by Jean-Marie Le Pen and his infamous National
Front; but he is quick to point out that the anti-racist
response has been massive and vigorous.
   This is all very well, but there is more: Dispassionate,
if fond, and enormously informative, "Fragile Glory" is more
than yet another book about France and the French. Although
nothing like a guidebook, it offers a fascinating, thorough,
and eminently useful explanation of the country and the way
it works; reading it will unquestionably make a trip to
France richer and more enjoyable.

   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were mixed in the week ended
yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination, or "consumer," CDs
sold directly by banks were virtually unchanged. The average
yield on a six-month CD eased to 7.37% from 7.38%, according
to an 18-bank national survey by Banxquote Money Markets, a
New York information service. The average yield on a
five-year consumer CD rose to 7.91% from 7.90%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also mixed were average yields on small-denomination CDs
sold by leading broker dealers. The average yield on a
three-month broker-sold CD fell to 7.74% from 7.87%,
according to Banxquote. The average yield for a two-year
broker-sold CD rose to 8.24% from 8.13%.
   Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
flat to up slightly. The average yield on a two-year jumbo CD
remained at 7.92%, while the average for a five-year maturity
rose to 8.27% from 8.25%.

   Atlanta Wins 1996 Summer Olympics;
   Games' Revenue Could Hit $3.5 Billion

   ATLANTA -- The Olympics are returning to the U.S.
   The International Olympic Committee awarded the 1996
Summer Games to Atlanta, a move that could generate as much
as $3.5 billion in revenue and some 84,000 jobs for the local
and state economy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Considered the darkest of horses when it began its bid 3
1/2 years ago -- primarily because Los Angeles held the Games
in 1984 -- Atlanta defeated five other cities in what proved
to be the most competitive bidding for the Olympics in
decades.
   Atlanta won the prize on the fifth ballot taken among the
IOC's 86 members, who had gathered in Tokyo. Atlanta
collected 51 votes compared with 35 for the runner-up of
Athens, Greece. Athens had been the sentimental favorite
because 1996 will mark the 100th anniversary of the first
modern Olympics, which were held in Athens. The other
competitors were Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Manchester, England;
Melbourne, Australia; and Toronto.
   "Right now, we're going to sit back and say, `Thank you,'
do a little fishing, and get reacquainted with our spouses,"
said William Payne, president of the Atlanta Organizing
Committee and the force behind the city's bid.
   That might be all that Atlanta's organizers have time for.
By most accounts, the city won the Games for three reasons:
its incessant and highly successful lobbying of IOC members;
the city's infrastructure, including numerous hotels and one
of the world's largest airports; and the likelihood that
Atlanta will generate a sizable surplus, part of which goes
to the IOC.
   What the city lacks, however, are many of the basic
facilities needed to stage an Olympics. Atlanta estimates it
will have to spend more than $400 million on new construction
alone, including an 85,000-seat track-and-field stadium,
housing for athletes, a swimming and diving site, and a
velodrome for bicycling competition.
   Moreover, problems that were all but drowned out in the
clamor surrounding the city's bid -- including Atlanta's
exploding crime rate and extensive homeless population --
will likely resurface as millions of dollars from TV networks
and corporate sponsors pour into the Atlanta Organizing
Committee's coffers.
   For instance, within hours of the IOC's decision,
Greenpeace Action, a local environmental group, called on the
Games' organizers to "tie the growing problems of
homelessness in Atlanta to the development of the Olympics,"
and to "achieve full housing in the city by 1996."
   Perhaps the most difficult task Atlanta's organizers face
in the coming months is simply abandoning their role as
salesmen and adopting that of developers. "For three years,
they've been trying to win friends and influence people,"
said John Bevilaqua, a vice president at the Los Angeles
Olympics and now president of a sports marketing firm in
Atlanta. "Now they'll be working on a dozen fronts: dealing
with environmental impact studies; setting up a security
plan; trying to find 100,000 volunteers -- you name it."
   And while the 1996 Olympics are more than 2,000 days away,
Atlanta's organizers may begin to feel some pressure in the
not-too-distant future, according to one individual familiar
with the process.
   Barcelona, Spain, the site of the 1992 Summer Olympics,
"will become the focus of the world and shelter {Atlanta} a
bit," said Peter Ueberroth, head of the 1984 Games in Los
Angeles. But "immediately afterward, the time will go quite
quickly."

   Xerox Corp. is to begin its latest bid to become a player
in the office computing market today, introducing a computer
workstation and a range of software products, industry
executives said.
   The workstation is a departure for Xerox because it will
be built by Sun Microsystems Inc. around Sun's widely
available Sparc microprocessor, the executives said. Xerox,
an office-products company based in Stamford, Conn., has sold
only proprietary workstations to run its well-regarded
Viewpoint software, used mainly for document-processing.
Xerox will also introduce a new version of Viewpoint written
for Sun's version of the Unix operating system, an industry
standard.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Industry executives said Xerox also will introduce a skein
of software packages intended to tie together the various
computers and programs used in most offices, in an attempt to
give users of computer networks a consistent,
easy-to-understand view of their work. Aside from Unix, it
will work with DOS and OS/2, the operating systems used by
most personal computers.
   Xerox's new computing "environment," while still tilted
toward document-processing applications, will be presented as
a systemwide approach similar to highly publicized products
such as International Business Machine Corp.'s OfficeVision
or Hewlett-Packard Co.'s New Wave, the executives said.
   The company is likely to promote its reputation as the
originator of many of the innovations in these packages, and
thus the most natural provider of software that exploits
them. A Xerox spokeswoman declined to comment on today's
announcement, which will be made in San Francisco.
   On Oct. 2, Xerox is expected to announce a large
multifunction copier-printer that will hook up with the
company's new products as well as a host of other hardware
and software products. That machine also will have scanning
and facsimile capabilities, and is expected to play a large
part in Xerox's push into office computing systems.

   These are edited excerpts from two recent legal opinions
involving savings and loans that have been seized by
government regulators (see related story: "At Lincoln
Savings: Skullduggery" -- WSJ Sept. 19, 1990). In one case,
the judge found that the seizure was an abuse of power. In
the other, the judge decided the regulators got it right. A
related editorial appears today {see related editorial --
"REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): Sheep and Goats" -- WSJ Sept
19, 1990}.

   From the opinion of Judge Dale Saffels in Franklin Savings
v. Office of Thrift Supervision:
                                                                                                       

   As in an initial matter, the court wishes to comment that
this is not a case involving an infamous or notorious savings
and loan association, the likes of which the public has
recently become more than familiar. This is not a case
involving fraud, corruption, or self-dealing by the
management or directors of Franklin. There has been no
allegation or even hint of illegal or unethical conduct by
Franklin's management or directors. Essentially, this case
boils down to a dispute over accounting practices.
   {From footnote one; see below for extracts from the
Lincoln case.} The court has reviewed defendant's recent
submission of additional authority, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
The court finds this authority of little value or guidance to
the present case. The facts established in Lincoln show clear
justification for the regulator's actions. Here, unlike in
Lincoln, the directors and management of Franklin have not
abused their position and have not been looting the
institution. Each case must be resolved on its own factual
situation.
                                                                                                       

   General Background
                                                                                                       

   Ernest F. Fleischer served as chairman of the board of
Franklin Savings Association until the appointment of
conservator on February 16, 1990. Franklin discovered that it
had economic losses in place that ranged from $40-60 million.
To address these losses, Franklin retained Dr. Wayne Angell,
then a professor of economics and finance at Ottawa
University in Ottawa, Kansas. Dr. Angell was retained to
determine whether Franklin could earn back the losses already
in place and continue to operate as a profitable business.
   In 1981 Dr. Angell determined that Franklin could earn a
safe profit on the purchase of Government National Mortgage
Association ("GNMA") mortgage backed securities ("MBS"). Dr.
Angell's analysis indicated that these securities could be
purchased at a value that far exceeded the cost of funds to
carry those assets.
   Franklin initially used Smith, Breeden's services to hedge
the maturity mismatch between its assets and liabilities. In
this hedging program if interest rates increased, Franklin
would experience gains from its positions in the futures
market which would be used to offset its increased cost for
funding deposit liabilities at a new higher rate of interest.
Conversely, if interest rates declined, the losses suffered
in the futures market would be offset by the gains from the
repricing of the liabilities.
   In late 1986, Franklin began the search to hire an
individual to lead and develop a research division, in house,
at Franklin. The research division was to replace the
services that had been provided by Smith, Breeden. In the
fall of 1987, John Scowcroft began working at Franklin. Mr.
Scowcroft had formerly been the head of the research
department at Merrill Lynch.
   Mr. Scowcroft successfully assembled a highly skilled and
talented cadre of professionals in Franklin's newly created
research department. This department was comprised of
individuals having Ph.D.s in finance and economics and
M.B.A.s, and having practical experience at many of the top
finance and brokerage firms in the nation. These individuals
included Massoud Heidari, who had a Ph.D. from MIT in
engineering and who had previously worked at First Boston;
Steve Hotopp, who had a Ph.D. from the University of
Illinois; and Dick Kazarian, who had a M.B.A. from the
University of Chicago and who had worked at Drexel. All these
individuals worked on developing Franklin's computer models.
Franklin also recruited Liz Kearns, M.B.S. Farleigh Dickinson
University, who had worked at Merrill Lynch and Standard and
Poor. Ms. Kearns was hired to work with liability management.
Ramine Rouhani, Ph.D. from Stanford in engineering and
economics, had worked at Goldman Sachs and CitiCorp, and was
hired by Franklin to work with management, hedge analysis and
interest rate models. Furthermore, Franklin was successful in
recruiting Michael Smirlock, Ph.D. from Washington
University, who had been a tenured professor at the Wharton
School of Business. Smirlock was in charge of Franklin's
asset acquisitions. Also, Franklin hired William Marshall,
Ph.D. from Washington University. Mr. Marshall previously had
been co-manager of Goldman Sachs's financial strategies
group.
                                                                                                       

   The Regulatory Examination
                                                                                                       

   In late 1988 some members of the FHLBB-Topeka staff were
highly criticized for their handling of Silverado Savings &amp;
Loan, a Colorado thrift, and were informed by Chairman M.
Danny Wall that their jobs were in jeopardy if their
performance did not improve. Some of these same individuals
were later involved in the October 1989 Franklin examination.
   The analyst in charge of Silverado, Thomas O'Rourke, was
assigned to work full time on the Franklin examination and
matters relating to Franklin beginning July 1, 1989.
   Mr. O'Rourke noted that Franklin had in its portfolio
similar assets to those formerly held by Silverado. This
similarity probably slanted Mr. O'Rourke's view against
Franklin and Franklin's system of operations.
   Mr. O'Rourke reviewed and read Franklin's Form 10K (annual
report) for the period ended June 30, 1989. Mr. O'Rourke had
previously read only one form 10K and was unaware of the
disclosures required in such a document. O'Rourke
misperceived the cautionary disclosures of "Material adverse
risk" in the form 10K as projections that the institution
would experience difficulties. However, Franklin made these
disclosures to fulfill its duty under federal securities
laws. Such disclosures were included in earlier 10Ks filed by
Franklin. After reviewing the Form 10K, Mr. O'Rourke drafted
a memorandum changing Franklin's internal OTS {Office of
Thrift Supervision} classification from "healthy" to
"marginal."
   The disclosures presented in Franklin's 10K for the period
ended June 30, 1989, were proper. The conclusions O'Rourke
and OTS reached after reviewing the 10K, that the risks
disclosed were likely or probable to occur, were arbitrary
and capricious and without reasonable basis.
   Members of the OTS-Topeka staff appeared to lack adequate
training and understanding to evaluate the nature of
Franklin's operation. The written analyses and memoranda
prepared by the Topeka staff, including portions of
Franklin's report of examination, Mr. O'Rourke's review of
Franklin's Form 10K, and the recommendation memo dated
February 12, 1989 contained fundamental factual errors as
well as material errors of interpretation and analysis.
   The recommendation memo, or "Smemo," went through several
drafts before the final form was executed. The draft
preceding the final version was changed, on specific advice
and instruction of OTS-Topeka district counsel, Brian
McCormally. McCormally indicated that it was necessary to
"point the finger" at Franklin's management. No factual or
legal basis exists for McCormally's instruction. This action
is indicative of arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable
conduct.
   February 15, 1990, Mr. Fleischer informed Thomas O'Rourke
of the conversation with IBJ Schroder, and that the bond
trustee was of the view that the Form 10Q did not constitute
an event triggering default and also of the possibility of a
bond exchange. Mr. O'Rourke was instructed by OTS district
counsel McCormally not to follow-up on this information.
   At the February 16, 1990, board of directors meeting, OTS
district counsel Brian McCormally informed Franklin that
OTS's outside counsel had provided an opinion that the Form
10Q as published and the report of examination constituted an
event of default allowing the bond trustee to being
collateral substitution or legal defeasance. This was
erroneous.
   Following the OTS's February 20, 1990, directive
concerning the hedge accounting and credit enhancement
write-downs, Franklin nonetheless had the means to comply
with all regulatory capital requirements through transactions
already scheduled to occur.
   On March 8, 1990, OTS was informed by facsimile
transmission that Franklin had available the means to meet
regulatory capital requirements, even if the hedge accounting
and credit enhancement write-downs were valid and that RTC
was preparing to announce publicly that Franklin was a
solvent institution. On the following day, March 9, 1990, OTS
imposed a second wave of adjustments consisting of an
additional $61.9 million (later corrected to $51.9 million)
"safety and soundness" hedge accounting write-down and a
write-down of $110 million relating to the tax agreements
entered into between Franklin and FSC. The court finds that
this second wave of adjustments imposed on March 9, 1990, was
arbitrary and capricious and lacked any reasonable basis.
                                                                                                       

   OTS's Directed Write-downs for Deferred Hedging Losses
                                                                                                       

   The hedge accounting issue in this case boils down to
whether Franklin's policy and procedures for ascertaining the
existence of high correlation and substantial offset in past
periods on an ongoing basis are appropriate implementation of
the general guidelines of FAS 80, in accordance with GAAP.
   Based on the evidence presented, this court is convinced
and finds that the hedge accounting policies dated June 30,
1988, and December 31, 1988, are consistent in all material
effects and are in accordance with GAAP.
   The expert opinion evidence presented in this case clearly
convinces the court that the challenged provisions of the
Franklin's correlation policy are safe and sound practices.
OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and without
reasonable basis in directing this second wave of write-downs
relating to the hedge accounting policy.
   Franklin's hedging program has not caused any economic
losses to the institution.
   There exists no relationship between the accounting gains
on sales of assets and the amount of Franklin's deferred
hedging losses. The court finds OTS's unsupported assertions
to the contrary to be without reasonable basis.
   Franklin was not dependent on gains from the sales of
assets to conduct profitable operations. For each year from
June 30, 1983, through December 31, 1989, Franklin had net
income after taxes, with gains and losses from sale of assets
and discontinued operations excluded.
                                                                                                       

   OTS's Write-downs Regarding Bond Defeasance
                                                                                                       

   OTS directed an additional $185 million reduction in
Franklin's capital to account for the bond defeasance of the
$2.9 million zero coupon bond issuance made in 1984. OTS
concluded that after the reductions were made for the other
write-downs, Franklin would fail to meet its core and
tangible capital requirements. OTS considered that this
failure of capital requirements would likely trigger the bond
defeasance/collateral substitution provision of the bond
indenture. Bond defeasance or collateral substitution would
result in a realization of $185 million reduction in
Franklin's capital. Therefore, OTS ordered this additional
write-down in capital.
   The court believes that the OTS improperly relied on the
bond issue in reaction to its failure to act promptly with
respect to similar zero coupon bonds issued by CenTrust
Savings Bank of Miami, Florida. OTS wanted to avoid
embarrassment, such as that caused by its failure to promptly
act and to prevent a loss on the CenTrust bonds. Franklin,
however, was not in the same position as CenTrust with regard
to zero coupon bonds. Franklin had never reported capital
failure as had CenTrust. OTS's attempt to draw a parallel
between Franklin's case and CenTrust's case was improper. An
OTS internal memo even indicates that the regulator knew that
Franklin was not in the same situation as CenTrust. (Exhibit
827, "Well, it ain't CenTrust, but it's all we got.") OTS's
action regarding the directed write-down for bond defeasance
was arbitrary and capricious and without reasonable basis in
law or fact.
                                                                                                       

   Charges of Biased or Prejudiced Action by OTS
                                                                                                       

   Franklin has contended that OTS acted with improper bias
and prejudice and in bad faith against Franklin. Although the
court has found that the OTS lacked statutory grounds for the
imposition of conservator and that the regulator made
erroneous findings and conclusions which lacked any
reasonable basis, the court finds that the regulator's
actions cannot be characterized as biased or prejudiced
against Franklin or taken in bad faith. It is most likely
that OTS/Topeka was motivated by the disturbing events that
had occurred earlier with regard to Silverado Savings and
Loan in Colorado and its difficulty with Franklin's unique
and innovative operations. Nevertheless, the court finds that
Franklin has not shown that OTS was motivated in its
decisions regarding the 1989 examination and the ultimate
imposition of the conservator in February 1990 by bias or
prejudice against Franklin or out of any type of bad faith.
                                                                                                       

   Final Comment
                                                                                                       

   The court's concern and review in this case is limited to
whether the OTS acted properly in February 1990 in appointing
a conservator for Franklin. The court realizes that Franklin
is not the same institution today that it was as of February
16, 1990, after six months of control by RTC. There could
very well be some difficulty in Franklin's management
reacquiring control and operating Franklin today. That,
however, is not the court's concern. The court was asked to
determine whether the regulator's action was valid and
appropriate at the time it was taken. We have performed this
task in an expeditious and judicious manner.
   The facts of this case clearly show that the regulator
acted wrongly in imposing the conservatorship. This court
must correct that wrongful action. Any problems in the
reacquisition of control by Franklin's management is a direct
result of the OTS's wrongful conduct in February 1990.
   It will now be the responsibility of Franklin's
management, and not the court, to effectively develop a plan
for operating the association after six months of
conservatorship, during which they had no control.

   Merchandise Trade Gap Grew in July
   As Exports Fell and Oil Imports Surged

   WASHINGTON -- A plunge in exports and a disturbing surge
in oil imports in the month before the Persian Gulf crisis
helped swell the U.S. merchandise trade deficit nearly $4
billion in July, to $9.33 billion, the Commerce Department
reported.
   The new figures are probably only the beginning of a
string of bad trade news for the U.S., as the jolt in oil
prices brought on by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait begins
to boost the U.S. petroleum-import bill further, many
economists said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If you think this trade deficit is bad wait till you see
the next few," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   After improving in five of the first six months this year,
exports tumbled 6.4% in July, to $32.03 billion from a record
$34.22 in June, the department said. The drop reflected lower
shipments of a range of goods, from factory machinery to farm
products.
   At the same time, imports jumped 4.5%, to $41.36 billion,
according to the report, bolstered by the higher petroleum
imports as well as increases in shipments of foreign-made
cars, capital goods and industrial supplies.
   In June the trade deficit had sunk to its lowest level in
seven years, $5.34 billion, and most analysts had said the
monthly gaps were unlikely to continue that small.
   Nevertheless, many were surprised by the magnitude of the
widening, partly because it came in a month when petroleum
prices fell.
   The price of a barrel of crude petroleum dropped to $14.50
in July from $14.68 in June, according to the report. But the
number of barrels imported grew to 274.5 million from 252
million, raising the country's oil bill 7.9% to $3.98
billion.
   Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher said yesterday that
the jump in oil prices as a result of the Middle East turmoil
is likely to increase the U.S. trade deficit more than $2
billion each month through the end of the year.
   That would mean that the monthly merchandise trade
deficit, which has narrowed substantially in 1988 and 1989,
probably won't shrink further this year. By the end of July
the trade gap was about $8 billion smaller than during the
like period in 1989.
   "I think it will be very difficult" to finish 1990 with an
improved trade deficit, said Sam Nakagama, chairman and chief
economist at Nakagama &amp; Wallace Inc., an economic advising
firm in New York. He also noted that the trade balances of
many countries around the world will be hurt by the oil-price
rise.
   But more worrisome than oil prices to some economists was
the big drop in exports, which had been one of the U.S.
economy's few remaining areas of growth. "It's another nail
in the coffin of the economic expansion," Mr. Kellner said.
   Other analysts were more sanguine, predicting that recent
declines in the value of the dollar will help exports by
making U.S. goods cheaper for foreign customers.
   The numbers in the report were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.

   Iraqi Troops Plunder Kuwait Museum

   While rampaging Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait City were looting
jewelry shops, shooting racehorses and making macabre dinners
out of rare zoo animals, some more disciplined troops from
Saddam Hussein's army made off with the treasures of the
Kuwait National Museum.
   "It is one of the most fabulous collections of Islamic art
in the world -- and it is all handpicked," said Esin Atil,
historian of Islamic Art at Washington, D.C.'s Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The museum that Ms. Atil remembers -- a cultural
storehouse of some 7,000 objects from countries as far-flung
as Spain and India, dating from the eighth century -- no
longer exists except as a shell. On Monday, a representative
for the Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington confirmed rumors of
looting that had been heard in U.S. museum circles. The
condition and whereabouts of the museum's manuscripts
(including one of the oldest surviving texts of the Koran),
medieval carvings, princely textiles and precious gemstones
are unknown.
   The most detailed report to date of the sacking has been
provided by a former researcher at the museum who escaped to
London this month.
   "I heard reports on the 26th of August that the soldiers
had gotten into the museum, and decided to go and check for
myself," said the researcher, who out of concern for family
members still in Kuwait asked that her name be withheld.
   Under disguise, she and a friend entered the museum and
were introduced to its "new director," a uniformed Iraqi
official from the Ministry of Information. On that visit, the
museum seemed intact. But on Sept. 4, she saw four large
Iraqi army trucks parked outside the museum.
   "This time I couldn't get in as close . . . but there
appeared to be people in civilian {dress} and uniforms," she
said. "Subsequently, I heard from others who had been there,
that they'd seen them {the soldiers} take out cases."
   Although grateful that the museum was not summarily laid
waste -- the fate of most Kuwaiti institutions -- the
researcher said she feared for the artifacts, many of which
are centuries-old and extremely fragile. Transport across the
desert in an army truck could damage ancient objects, and the
drastic change in climate could further affect sensitive
manuscripts, wood carvings and textiles.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi officials in Washington deny any
knowledge that this highly organized act of plunder took
place.
   "We don't have the slightest idea about that," said
Mahasin Yono, an Iraqi Embassy representative. "We don't have
any information regarding that matter." Nor, by her account,
does her government have any official position on protecting
Kuwaiti-owned art. If, as seems likely, the methodical
plunder of the Kuwait collection was planned from Baghdad, it
amounted to a direct insult to the legacy of the recently
deposed Kuwaiti royal family.
   The Kuwait National Museum was established in 1983 by two
members of the al-Sabah family, Sheikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed
al-Sabah and his wife, Sheikha Hussa Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah.
Eager to create an Islamic cultural repository in their
country, the couple began collecting artifacts from all over
the world in 1975 and assembled a portion of them as a museum
with the help of Marilyn Jenkins, a curator of Islamic art at
New York's Metropolitan Museum. In 1985, the al-Sabahs
sponsored archaeological digs in Egypt.
   Sheikha Hussa is now in Switzerland. Her husband's
whereabouts are unknown. And all that remains for sure of
their magnificent museum collection is a small group of
objects now bound for exhibitions in the U.S.
   More than 100 pieces from the Kuwait National Museum were
on exhibition at the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad during the
time of the invasion. On Dec. 9, they will arrive in this
country for "Islamic Art and Patronage: Selections From
Kuwait," at Baltimore's Walters Art Gallery.
   Ms. Atil, who is curator for the show, little suspected
two years ago that the objects she would select for the show
might be all that would survive of the collection. Some of
the museum's greatest treasures were left off the list
because they were "too fragile or too important," she said,
clearly regretting her earlier scruples.
   "There was one very important 14th-century luster-painted
vase that had the name of the maker as well as the patron,
that had been broken and repaired," Ms. Atil said. "I felt we
should not handle this more than necessary. There were some
marvelous intact early Islamic glass vessels that I felt were
too dangerous to include . . . We took ones that were already
broken and repaired, because if anything happened they would
break in the old place."
   However, other rare objects did make it out of Kuwait for
Ms. Atil's show, among them a 10th-century astrolabe, a
10th-century marble column from a Spanish palace, late 16th-
and 17th-century Indian jewelry, and 16th- and 17th-century
Turkish rugs.
   Other treasures from the Kuwaiti museum owe their survival
to "Romance of the Taj Mahal," an exhibition at the Virginia
Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond through Nov. 25 (the show
then moves to New York's Asia Society). Although the
exhibition features just six objects from the Kuwait National
Museum, they include some of its finer examples of
17th-century Indian jewelry: a 530-carat emerald necklace, a
gold-inlaid dagger with a jewel-encrusted scabbard, and a
delicate cameo carved from onyx and rubies.
   The fate of these artifacts is as uncertain as that of
Kuwait itself. Ms. Atil's exhibition, which will tour the
U.S. through April 1992, may then head on to yet unscheduled
exhibitions in Europe. But the emeralds and other objects
from "Romance of the Taj Mahal" may have to stay put, thanks
to a White House executive order that has frozen Kuwaiti
assets in this country, along with those of its occupying
power, Iraq.
   "They will come back to us for safekeeping if the
executive order has not been lifted," said Pamela Jenkinson
of the Los Angeles County Museum, which organized the Taj
show.
   As for the bulk of the Kuwaiti collection, the refugee art
researcher in London is keeping her fingers crossed that
Saddam Hussein will turn out to be a good curator. "It has
taken us so long to get it together and get it to the Middle
East," she said. "It's sad, but we'll just have to hope."

   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose despite U.S. reports of a
yawning trade gap and quickening inflation.
   Though the dollar was sold after the announcements of the
bleak U.S. data, the selling stalled before the dollar
touched a recent low against the mark. Technicians reasserted
control and halted the decline. Then, other traders stepped
in to square their short, or oversold, dollar positions and
boosted the U.S. currency even more.

<TEXT>
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5530 marks, up from 1.5480 marks late Monday in New York.
   The U.S. currency climbed to 137.85 yen, up from 136.55
yen. It also rose to 1.2905 Swiss francs from 1.2765 francs.
Sterling was unchanged at $1.9140.
   "There was just not enough bad news to push the dollar
down," said Donald Hubbard, a Midland Bank treasury officer
in New York.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 138.45 yen, up from 137.68 yen at the close there Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5525
marks, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.5560 marks.
   Also supporting the dollar yesterday were slight declines
in Swiss and Belgian benchmark interest rates, said Walter
Simon, a New York dealer with Bank Julius Baer. Complementing
looser money trends in France and Italy, the Swiss National
Bank's market-set Lombard rate eased to 9% from 9.375%
Monday, while the Belgian National Bank shaved its
three-month Treasury bill rate to 9% from 9.05%.
   Some analysts have suggested that the Bundesbank is
encouraging credit relaxation by nations neighboring Germany,
in an attempt to support the mark without raising its own
rates. Mr. Simon, however, said the moves probably have more
to do with domestic considerations in those countries.
   The U.S. currency hit bottom at 1.5420 marks about an hour
and a half after the economic numbers were released. That was
well short of its record low of 1.5385 marks, set on Aug. 27,
and just below the 1.5440-mark point that signals a buying
opportunity to some technicians.
   The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade
deficit widened in July to $9.33 billion from a revised $5.34
billion in June. The shortfall was much worse than the $7.6
billion expected.
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the nation's consumer
price index rose 0.8% in August, or at a 9.6% annual rate.
The leap, which was twice the size of the July increase, had
been expected because the report was the first to reflect the
rise in crude-oil prices since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   However, the so-called core rate of inflation, excluding
food and energy, jumped 0.5%, showing the gas pump isn't the
only source of price pressure.
   For the U.S. economy, the reports were pure bad news. For
the dollar, however, they were mixed.
   For example, the inflation pace may restrain the Federal
Reserve from easing credit, even if negotiators produce a
budget deficit reduction pact that is considered credible.
And lower interest rates would discourage foreigners from
buying dollars.
   As currency movements showed, "we still haven't seen
enough of what is going on in the U.S. economy to make big
bets on the dollar," said Lisa Finstrom, an analyst at Lehman
Brothers. That may have to wait for the September employment
numbers in early October, she said.
   The yen was among the day's biggest losers. The Japanese
currency was hurt by profit-taking from its recent run-up, as
well as surging oil prices and a second day of declines on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei Index shed 480.78 points
Tuesday after losing 531.86 points Monday.
   Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan officials tried to
talk the home currency higher Tuesday by calling the yen's
recent gains "welcome" -- but to little effect.
   Meanwhile, the dollar ended European dealings mostly
weaker. Dealers said that the dollar remains under pressure
from economic fundamentals but added that yesterday's U.S.
economic reports weren't bad enough to push the currency
below recent record lows.
   The dollar finished Asian trading higher on covering of
short dollar positions. The U.S. currency was last quoted in
Tokyo Tuesday at 137.68 yen, above 137 yen late Monday.
Traders also said Japanese life insurance companies bought
dollars when the currency was at the 137.50 yen level.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $387.60 an ounce, down $1.80. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $387.95 an ounce.

   Workplace:
   Sweet Revenge Is Souring the Office

   The decade of downsizing has triggered another legacy:
revenge. A growing number of employees are retaliating (or
fantasizing about it) for past or perceived wrongs. They are
taking it out on colleagues, bosses or their companies in
general.
   That's the disquieting report from management consultants,
psychologists and managers. They acknowledge that the
dog-eat-dog world of corporate and office politics has always
sparked acts of retribution. But they say things are getting
out of hand. And while revenge may be sweet, it can also be
devastating, especially when careers and reputations are at
stake.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   People look to exact revenge when they believe they have
been slighted and feel the need to repair the perceived
damage done to them, says Ronald S. Ebert, a psychologist at
the Levinson Institute in Belmont, Mass. "While to an
objective observer, the slight may appear to be of small
consequence, to the individual who feels harmed, it's
significant."
   Mr. Ebert notes that with increased anxiety over job
security present in the workplace, he has found himself
counseling more and more employees experiencing difficulties
in coping with their work situations.
   "Business is all too good for me," the psychologist says.
"It's a change from recent years," he adds, warning that the
workplace is well on the way to becoming a breeding ground
for vengeful acts.
   Revenge takes many forms, from the subtle to the shocking.
Mr. Ebert cites one of his patients who, demoted to a menial
job after years with a Boston-area high-tech company, was
found with a loaded gun in the company parking lot. He blamed
his supervisor for the demotion and was waiting for the
supervisor to arrive at work to retaliate violently.
   A longtime Walt Disney Co. employee used far subtler
tactics to get even after she was passed over for a promotion
she felt she deserved. Knowing that her new boss faced
pressure to vastly improve the work he supervised, the woman
began taking much longer than usual to complete projects.
When he wrote a negative job evaluation, without even talking
to her, and placed it in her employment file, she responded
with a lengthy memo -- and sent copies to the division's top
brass. She also made nasty comments about his actions to a
few colleagues behind his back.
   "This was vengeful, and I did it purposely," she admits.
"But I felt totally justified. I knew it would really hurt my
boss and destroy his credibility." And it did. "All hell
broke loose," she recounts. Within months her boss was fired
-- and she got his job. (That explains why she demands
anonymity.)
   And there is the executive recruiter who, apparently still
angry at his former big bank employer for assigning him to an
undesirable location after he turned down a foreign
assignment, never loses an opportunity to raid that bank in
his headhunting forays.
   Middle managers aren't the only ones looking to get even.
Note the flood of tell-all books that have come out of the
executive suite and corporate board room in recent years.
Company bigwigs who aren't all that concerned about the
consequences have been known to use these books to take
potshots at former colleagues and get back at business
rivals. The books often contain juicy tidbits that weren't
all that well known before their exposure on the printed
page.
   Al Neuharth, former chief executive officer at Gannett
Co., admits in his autobiography, "Confessions of an S.O.B.,"
to having had a hand in unseating his boss at Gannett and in
undermining a company executive. All, it seems, for the sake
of getting even and getting ahead.
   Judith Briles, author of "Woman to Woman: From Sabotage to
Support," points in her book to the head of a West Coast
public relations and advertising agency whose reputation was
nearly ruined by a vengeful employee. The employee had been
threatened with firing because she didn't produce and had
been accused of telling clients she was planning to start her
own firm.
   When the Internal Revenue Service was investigating the
company for mistakes it made in an annual audit, the angry
employee used the occasion to plant rumors with the local
media about alleged financial improprieties by the boss. The
negative publicity almost did the firm in. Later, some
newspapers ran retractions of stories they had printed. But
by then, the firm had already lost a number of its clients,
and the boss had spent $30,000 in tax attorneys' fees to
clear herself, Ms. Briles says.
   The streamlining binge that felled millions of managers
and employers over the past decade also took its toll on
corporate loyalty. And that has spurred getting even. "No
matter how you describe it -- reduction in the work force,
retrenchment or downsizing" -- an executive who loses his or
her job can't help but feel "bitter, defeated, and angry,"
says Arnold Menn, an Austin, Texas, outplacement consultant.
   A casualty of McGraw-Hill Inc.'s cutback last December,
which eliminated over 1,000 people, says she can't lose the
feeling of betrayal toward her former employer, even though
she has landed on her feet. She says she has been tempted to
bad-mouth the publishing concern and tip competitors to
company secrets.
   "When you're associated with a company, you want to hear
good things about it," she says. "But when you're no longer
associated with it, who cares? When I hear the name
McGraw-Hill, I associate it with bad feelings and get these
nasty emotions. It's a simple step to go beyond that and say
something nasty." She adds, "It was more than just a job; it
was a family. So it was worse than if I never cared about the
job to begin with."
   Short of changing the locks -- which is what one New York
consulting firm does every time it lays someone off -- what
can managers do to protect themselves and their employers
against possible retaliation from a worker out to get even?
   First, they must realize that "revenge comes of intense
frustration," says Nella G. Barkley, president of
Crystal-Barkley Corp., a New York-based career-consulting and
training concern. "If you find yourself dealing with the same
troublesome issue over and over again, you can bet something
is wrong."
   Ms. Barkley advises managers to identify the person in the
office who acts as a sounding board for others, who hears all
the gripes, no matter how petty. This person, she says, can
be a valuable conduit of information without becoming a
snitch.
   Ms. Briles, in her book, offers several telltale signs
that often give away a vengeful employee. Be alert, she says,
for an employee who gossips, lies, takes credit for the work
of others, organizes groups that exclude people, withholds
information, or misdirects memos or phone calls.
   Mr. Ebert, the psychologist, urges managers to be
attentive to their associates. "Managers aren't therapists
and shouldn't try to be," he says. But the more that work
procedures are shared and employees involved, he maintains,
the less likely it is that employees will feel frustrated,
angry, rejected -- and want revenge.

   Rule of Law:
   Only David Souter Knows for Sure
   What Justice Souter Would Do

<LP>
   It was no surprise that several people in the Senate
hearing room yesterday wore Stop Souter buttons. What was
surprising is that some of them were conservative Republican
staffers, amazed by what they had heard from David Souter.
His hearings made clear he will not be William Brennan, but
also will not be Robert Bork. His confirmation thus ensured,
the question is: Will Justice Souter rule according to the
signals many think he sent in the hearings or according to
the way he ruled the past 12 years in more than 200 opinions?
   The jury is still out after the fog of three days of
hearings as political theater. The senators who smeared,
tarred and feathered Mr. Bork established that their hearings
are not Oxford tutorials. Instead, full points for clever
hedging. Certainly Bush administration coaches urged Judge
Souter to offer up soothing words to placate liberal
senators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still, imagine the shock of Republican Sen. Charles
Grassley when he tossed Judge Souter this soft pitch:
   "Those who advocate a greater activist role for the court
say that the broad and spacious terms of the Constitution
lend themselves to court-made solutions when the political
branches fail to act. What is your sense of this perception
that the courts, rather than the elected branches, should
take the lead in creating a more just society?"
   "Courts must accept their own responsibility for making a
just society," Judge Souter said, adding that "political
responsibility, constitutional responsibility abhor a
vacuum." Judge Souter did stress that Congress should act
when it has the authority, but did not reassure that "a just
society" is one in which judges stick to their knitting.
Justice Brennan, the great vacuum filler, must have been
amused.
   Judge Souter also said he thought there were rights not
clearly enumerated in the Constitution. He was pressed on how
far judges can go in discovering these rights. One line of
questions asked for his reaction to an approach by Justice
Antonin Scalia, who said judges should look for "the most
specific level at which a relevant tradition protecting or
denying protection to the asserted right can be identified."
In other words, go back in our history to see if the supposed
right has ever been viewed as a constitutional right.
   Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden hinted to Judge Souter what
he thought of this approach. Sen. Biden dismissed the idea of
looking to American traditions with the sneer of "garbage in,
garbage out." Judge Souter took a middle road. He preferred a
"quest for reliable evidence," a less defined notion than the
one Justice Scalia offered.
   Despite many 10-second sound bites that sent chills up
conservative spines -- praising Justice Brennan as
"fearlessly principled," for example -- the full transcript
would not necessarily exclude Judge Souter from the court's
intellectual conservative wing. In the end, for example,
Judge Souter only acknowledged a privacy right for married
couples, declining clearly to extend the concept of privacy.
It's murky, but he didn't seem to accept the Griswold
contraception case, with its search for penumbras and
emanations from enumerated rights.
   Then there was endless questioning usually in legal code
about how he might rule on abortion, civil-rights and other
politicized issues. These questions were often framed as how
seriously judges should take which rights. The Constitution
of course does not say that some rights are important and
others are optional. Yet judges over the years have announced
that some rights, such as the First Amendment, get the
highest protection, while others, economic liberties
especially, get less or no protection. This is judicial
activism through three made-up levels of review: rational
relationship, substantially related and strict scrutiny.
   Judge Souter assured liberal senators that
sex-discrimination cases should get greater protection than
economic-rights cases. The problem with this analysis is that
the greatest act of judicial activism is denying equal
protection to all rights. Judge Souter hinted that he had
thought about this problem, but hadn't quite "gotten to the
point of saying we ought to scrap the whole notion of three
tiers and just take, in effect, every issue as an original
balancing issue." Maybe he will. As Federal Appeals Judge
Alex Kozinski has said, "I can certainly conceive of rational
people who, if pressed to a choice, would be willing to give
up the right to wear a jacket with obscene words on it in
order to retain the right to construct a building or run a
railroad."
   Judge Souter was asked about the litigation explosion,
which not even bar presidents deny. Judge Souter said, "I'm
wary of putting very much weight" on the explanation that
judges have recognized "new causes of action that didn't
exist 10, 20 and 50 years ago." Instead, he said that "the
fact is the population has grown far more exponentially than
rights of action." Even assuming somehow this is true for New
Hampshire, Justice Souter would quickly feel the effects of
the more than quintupling of cases in federal courts to
275,000 today from 45,000 in 1950. Claims under everything
from RICO to strict product liability to "psychic injury"
dwarf the population increase in both citizens and judges.
   There was one question that Judge Souter knocked out of
the park. He was asked, "Do you think it is judicial activism
to rule that capital punishment is always cruel and unusual
punishment?" The audience in the hearing room grew very
quiet. This prohibition on all death penalties is the
position of Justices Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, despite
the Constitution's contemplation of capital punishment in
several clauses. Not even Anthony Kennedy in his hearings
totally dismissed this position. Judge Souter did, saying, "I
think that would be an insupportable decision under the
Constitution, and I say that with a recognition that there
are members of the Supreme Court who disagree with me."
   What about the judicial activism that created the
exclusionary rule as the way this country would protect
accused criminals? "It's one thing to try to come up with a
pragmatic approach to the enforcement of a constitutional
value or standard which is itself accepted," Judge Souter
said. "It's another thing to derive standards based simply on
personal judicial views on what would be desirable in the
world." Judge Souter said if the exclusionary rule makes it
back to the Supreme Court, the justices should "ask very
practical questions about how it actually works." In other
words, weigh the exclusionary rule against the criminals who
get off or get plea bargains and also against alternative
remedies against the police. This could be bye-bye, Miranda.
   One of the tragedies of the Bork battle is that the Senate
hearings have been reduced to primitive ritual. A
conservative nominee must offer up enough sacrifices to
please the gods, but not so many that he becomes despised by
his own kind. We will know whether David Souter passed both
parts of this test only once he has been given the
opportunity as Justice Souter.

   Near the northern border of Saudi Arabia, a young Saudi
air-force captain looks around for eavesdroppers, then lowers
his voice. "The Iraqis are real fighters, not like the
Americans," he says. "They fought through eight years of heat
and dust and blood, and they're tough, I'm telling you."
   Just 35 miles to the north, Iraqis are moving position
daily, sliding up and down the border in a game of nerves
with the several thousand Saudis, Egyptians, Syrians,
Moroccans and Kuwaitis who move to match them, like pieces on
a vast chessboard.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The American forces are positioned hundreds of miles to
the rear of these forward posts. If war comes, this flat and
featureless desert plain will be its first killing field and
the odd assortment of Arab and Islamic forces massed here
will be its likeliest first casualties. Eventually, troops
promised by Arab and Islamic nations could match the scale of
the U.S. buildup in Saudi Arabia. But such forces have been
slow to deploy, and so far the purpose of those who have
arrived seems more symbolic than strategic. "It's important
in the Middle East that Arabs see their own people being
given a responsible part of the task," says Don Kerr, a Saudi
Arabia expert in London. "Being at the front line -- the
tripwire, if you like -- is a very responsible role."
   By pushing these troops to the front line, Iraqi soldiers
are compelled to stare into the faces of their Moslem
brothers rather than at the massed might of the U.S. military
machine. But the mirror works two ways here, and the long
desert days have given Arab troops on this side of the border
plenty of time to contemplate combat with their Iraqi
counterparts. A tour of these northern border positions
reveals widely differing views -- between senior commanders
and junior officers, between Egyptians, Saudis and Kuwaitis
-- about exactly what they have come here to do, and what the
outcome might be.
   This is mirage country, where the landscape is softened
only by illusions. Tricks of light deposit shimmering sheets
of water in the distance, and set army trucks afloat on them.
Apart from man-made intrusions such as tents and sandbagged
artillery, the only relief for the eye is an occasional
camel, marking the horizon like a squiggle of Arabic
calligraphy.
   The young Saudi air-force captain feels at home in this
bleakness, a lot more at home than he did a few weeks ago in
Alabama, where he completed advanced training in flying
Blackhawk helicopters. In his U.S.-style desert camouflage,
there is little to distinguish him from an American soldier.
But there is an edge to his voice, and it betrays an
uneasiness with his new American brothers-in-arms.
   "Americans lead very closed-in lives," he says. In
Alabama, he recalls, "someone asked me if Saudi Arabia was in
California." He wonders if such people know what they are up
against, thousands of miles from home. And most of all, he
wonders whether he doesn't have more in common with his Iraqi
enemy than with his American ally.
   The Americans, he says, "are complaining about the heat
even though the weather these days is nice for this desert.
They say they want to fight and get it over with. Me, I don't
want it, and {the Iraqis} don't want it. My family's village
is just a few miles from the Iraqi border. We are the same
religion, same language, same people. Believe me, I know
them, and I know that fighting them won't be so easy." The
captain's great hope is that the Iraqis will have the courage
to overthrow their leader, and that the Americans will have
the patience to wait for that to happen.
   Saudi ambivalence about fighting alongside Americans has
its faint echoes in the Saudi government's official rhetoric.
Describing the foreign troops in Saudi Arabia, government
statements invariably use the formulation, "Arab, Islamic and
friendly forces," which, given the current ratio of U.S. to
Arab and Islamic ground troops (about five to one) is about
like trying to hide the bulk of the White House behind a
spindly minaret. "It's nonsense," admits one Saudi official.
"Eventually I think it will find its way into the garbage
along with all the rhetoric about `fraternal Iraq.'"
   While some Saudis worry about the tenacity of Americans,
their own forces -- untested in war -- are perhaps a greater
unknown. These include an army of 38,000 and a National Guard
of 56,000 currently swelling with new recruits. Just a
hundred years ago, the very thought of Arabia's desert
warriors -- who never succumbed to colonial conquerers --
inspired dread in their neighbors. The journals of the
British explorer, Charles Doughty, are full of the dire
warnings he received from Arab friends on the eve of his 1877
journey to the region. "If one goes into Arabia, he should
carry his shroud under his arm," said one. Warned another:
"Why cast your life away? You know them not. But we know
them. The Bedouins are fiends."
   Today's highly urbanized Saudis, although well-trained and
equipped with the best that money can buy, are two or three
generations removed from the hard men who waged tribal war on
these sands. At a mobile field hospital set up behind the
front lines, a Saudi dermatologist named Abed al-Twerki lists
photodermatitis -- otherwise known as sunburn -- as among the
biggest health problems so far. An Arab, he says "is no
different to an American. If you take people from the cities
and you bring them to the desert, every day you'll get cases
of headache, sunburn or stomach pains" until they adjust.
   Further north, at a Saudi tank-brigade encampment, the
officers' quarters occupy a large, fabric-lined tent, fitted
out in the traditional style of a desert sheik with oriental
carpets and bolsters. A TV set sits on an ice-filled cooler
alongside a touchtone phone. "You can dial America direct
from here," a Saudi soldier boasts. Lunch -- fried chicken,
grilled quail, rice, french fries, salad, shaslik, stuffed
courgettes and 7-Up -- arrives by helicopter from the giant
northern base, King Khalid Military City, and is dished out
by Filipino waiters.
   The Saudis have some 15,000 of their own troops in the
northern region. Alongside them are 2,000 Egyptian commandos,
1,200 Moroccans, 3,000 Syrians, 2,000 men each from Pakistan
and Bangladesh and around 5,000 Kuwaitis. Some of the Islamic
nations also have troops elsewhere in Saudi Arabia -- all
massed against much larger forces across the border. "We came
here because we are ready for them; numbers don't make a
difference to us," says Brig. Gen. Turki al-Nefie, commanding
the Saudis' 20th Mechanized Brigade from a sandbagged bunker.
   But Western military analysts aren't as confident. "With
the exception of Egypt and Syria, who have armor on the way,
everyone else is pretty cosmetic," says a Western diplomat in
Riyadh. The Saudis have beeen "inundated" by offers of troops
from small Third World countries, he says. "But if combat
breaks out we are talking about a desert tank campaign shades
of World War II in Libya, and while token armed forces might
have an important political role, in a military sense 1,000
Bangladeshi riflemen aren't the answer to that."
   The Syrians, despite the size of their commitment, have
proved the most publicity-shy of all. About once a week,
Saudi officials organize visits to the various Arab armies,
ferrying journalists north by transport planes, buses and
four-wheel-drive vehicles. According to the Saudis, the
Syrians have sent special-forces commandos dispatched from
assignment on the Golan Heights, Syria's contested border
with Israel. "The Syrians just took their position today, and
they're too busy for us to see them," explains a Saudi escort
officer, as a press bus accelerated past what appeared to be
a Syrian encampment adjacent to the Saudi front line. "But
that's exactly what you told us last week," an American
journalist grumbles.
   Saudi officials say they have designed a command structure
that quarantines Syrians and other Arab forces from U.S.
control. The degree of coordination between Saudis and
Americans, and between the various Arab forces, remains
unclear. Brig. Gen. al-Nefie says "there are no Americans at
all" in his northern command area, but adds that an American
officer occasionally visits his forward command post. As for
the nearby Syrian forces, he says, "when we have neighboring
units we always coordinate between commanders to cover gaps."
   But barriers to coordination in combat are potentially
nightmarish here. Syrians fight according to Soviet doctrine;
Saudis use U.S. tactics. Saudis and Moroccans speak such
different Arabic dialects that they can barely understand
each other. Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Arab troops have to
communicate with each other in English. The Saudis shrug off
such difficulties, saying that liaison officers are working
out any problems.
   While the Arab and Islamic forces haven't brought the
high-tech weaponry of the Americans, many have come armed
with battle experience. The Moroccans have fought a long
desert war with Polisario guerrillas in the Western Sahara,
and the Egyptians and Syrians have bitter experience in
battle against the Israelis. Some of these veterans, having
seen the U.S. driven from Vietnam and Lebanon, doubt American
staying power in a vicious contest with war-hardened Iraqis.
   For the most part, American troops are having little
contact with their Arab counterparts, even on bases far from
the border. Some seem torn between the urge to get to know
their Arabian hosts and the fear instilled by years of seeing
Arabs as terrorist threats to U.S. military personnel. Just a
few yards separate American and Saudi crews maintaining their
own air force's fighter planes in a vast hangar at King Abdul
Aziz Airbase. But the work schedule is too grueling to allow
for chat, and off duty the only point of contact is the
airbase gym. So far, says one 22-year-old airman, most U.S.
personnel haven't been allowed off-base, and that suits him
fine. He fears becoming a terrorist target if he ventures
into town. "I'm planning to go home," he says.
   At the northern front, it is the senior officers --
Kuwaiti and Saudi -- who are most eager to fight Iraq. "For a
military man like me, I wish we could transfer the order from
defense to offense -- waiting isn't good," says Gen. Mohammed
al-Sheri, logistics commander of the northern sector. He, at
least, isn't awed by Iraqi fighting prowess. The general is
among the few who have had contact with Iraqi deserters.
After a conversation with three of them, he says, "I know
their morale: They are dead." He says their rations were
mainly dirty flour and their gas masks were so old and
ill-fitting "they wouldn't even keep dust out, much less
chemicals."
   He describes his own troops' morale, by contrast, as
"wonderful," despite a barrage of Iraqi propaganda carefully
aimed at both Arab and American troops. Iraqi radio
broadcasts attempt to both goad the Americans with tales of
Gulf shieks seducing American women and reassure them that
Iraq respects Christians. But the broadcasts also tell Arab
troops of U.S. soldiers cavorting with Arab women inside the
gates of the holy mosques at Mecca and Medina and deride
Christians as infidels. Since many of the Arab troops speak
fluent English, such contradictory broadcasts create hilarity
rather than the hoped-for horror.
   Yet Gen. al-Sheri says such efforts shouldn't be entirely
shrugged off. "Iraqis are good at propaganda," he says. "I
can admit it because we were deceived by them." During the
Iran-Iraq war, he says, "I took from my own salary to give to
the Iraqis, and I saved from my own food." Just six months
earlier, he says, he proudly shook Saddam Hussein's hand when
the Iraqi leader was an honored guest at King Khalid Military
City. "He said, `We now are building a very strong army, and
it's good for the whole Arab nation.' And we believed it
all," says the general, shaking his head.
   Egyptians, too, strongly supported Iraq during the Gulf
war. The government sent arms and some Egyptians even
volunteered to fight alongside Iraqis. At a camp guarded by
stern troops armed with fixed bayonets, Col. Abdulrahaman
Mohammed Sayyed heads 2,000 Egyptian commandos, some of whom
saw combat against Israel in 1973.
   But the Egyptian commander isn't forthcoming when asked
how his men see their current enmity with Iraq. At first, he
tries to brush off the question by saying none of the men
under his command volunteered to fight with Iraq against
Iran. Asked again, he replies that "we are not fighting now;
we are defending the kingdom of Saudi Arabia." Questioned
further, he states: "The unit here is made up of professional
career soldiers who, once given orders, will execute the
orders regardless who the enemy is."
   Outside, as troops file out of their tents for weapons
drill, a young captain named Mohammed Adel Fettah bluntly
states that his mission is defensive. "We as Arabs and
Moslems under Islam know that no Arab should attack an Arab
brother, no Moslem should attack another Moslem. That's all
there is to it," he says. "We won't make war on Iraq, but if
they enter Saudi Arabia, then we will defend it."
   As the Arab forces wait in the desert for a battle many
hope won't happen, the Saudis face the growing task of
meeting all the logistical needs for the assortment of
forces. Fortunately, says Gen. al-Sheri, some bought their
own spare parts, so the Saudis don't have immediate problems
chasing supplies for the Syrians' Soviet weapons or the
Moroccans' Spanish-made vehicles. But some odd orders are
being filled: the Egyptians report that the Saudis somehow
are supplying them with their national dish -- "molokia" -- a
slimy green vegetable scooped up on Arabic bread. While the
Egyptian troops don't share the Americans' degree of
discomfort with the desert, they are equally beset by
boredom. To fill free time, they play soccer and, as the
comedians of the Arab world, concoct daring political jokes
about the current sorry state of Arabian politics.
   Asked to share one, an Egyptian colonel, Wagdu Abde,
glances toward the nearby Saudis and declines with a grin.
"If you come to Cairo I will tell you," he says.

   GM-UAW Pact Allows Company to Cut
   Payroll in Return for Worker Buy-Outs

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp.'s new three-year agreement
with the UAW amounts to a massive golden handshake for its
blue-collar workers under which the company will pay $4
billion for the right to shrink its U.S. work force.
   Details of the proposed pact, which was overwhelmingly
approved yesterday by top UAW leaders, show an elaborate web
of provisions aimed at cutting GM's active U.S. blue-collar
work force from its current level of 280,000 people.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among the pact's features: "pre-retirement leaves" that
allow older workers to leave their jobs at 85% of full-time
pay; a reduction in the minimum early-retirement age to 50
years from 55 years, richer bonuses for those who agree to
simply quit GM.
   In addition, annual pensions for workers under 62 years
old who retire with 30 years' seniority will rise 20% to
$21,600 a year in 1992 from $18,000 a year now. Regular
pension benefits will rise 17% under the proposed pact.
Lump-sum buy-out payments offered to younger workers who want
to quit GM will be sweetened to a maximum $72,000 from
$65,000 now.
   All these measures amount to a program aimed at
encouraging older workers to leave, analysts said.
   "We can expect a considerably smaller work force at GM in
1993," said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University
of California at San Diego. "There's no question but that the
pensions increase was one more mechanism to help shrink the
work force."
   That shrinkage could be substantial. While precise figures
weren't available yesterday, the average GM worker is 44
years old -- just six years short of the new early-retirement
age. By 1995, normal attrition could cut GM's active U.S.
labor force to less than 200,000 workers from about 280,000
now, according to one internal estimate.
   But the new contract could accelerate the normal rate of
attrition at GM. And it could benefit the company, as younger
workers now on lay-off move into jobs vacated by older
employees who retire, or take sweetened buy-out packages to
simply quit.
   And while GM will pay a high price for gains in efficiency
related to a smaller work force, the proposed contract leaves
the company considerable flexibility.
   Workers who are currently laid off will get an additional
financial cushion -- but not a guarantee of jobs. GM will
guarantee 52 weeks of pay at 95% of weekly earnings for
workers with less than 10 years' seniority. Those workers get
less than six months of coverage now. Workers with more than
10 years' seniority will get up to three years of pay at 95%
of their base earnings, compared with two years or less now.
   GM can still idle plants if sales fall drastically. The
catch: It must pay full wages and benefits to workers who are
laid off for more than 36 weeks over the next three years.
Workers in this situation would be placed in a "jobs bank,"
and be given priority for openings elsewhere in GM's U.S.
operations. However, these workers also could be offered
buy-outs, or early-retirement deals that are now about 17%
richer than in the past.
   UAW officials said yesterday that the agreement requires
GM to discuss any proposed plant closing with the union. And
they said the agreement includes a "moratorium" on plant
closings similar to one included in the last pact.
   But Stephen P. Yokich, the union's top GM bargainer,
declined to say specifically yesterday whether the moratorium
prohibits GM from closing more plants by classifying them as
"indefinitely idled" due to market conditions. GM used this
loophole to close four U.S. car factories during the past
three years. Company officials said they expect GM will go
ahead with previously announced plans to close two truck
plants between now and the end of 1993.
   To be sure, there are some measures that will protect UAW
jobs, and benefit those who want to stay at GM. Base wages
will rise 3% this year, with 3% lump sum payments in the next
two years.
   The agreement also gives the union more power to block the
company from giving work to outside suppliers, a practice
called "outsourcing." Under the pact, GM will give the union
detailed information about the comparative costs of doing the
work in-house or sending it to an outside supplier. The
agreement even allows the union to bid on work now being done
by outside suppliers.
   Workers affected by outsourcing also will have the right
to take the issue to an arbitrator. GM and union officials
said the new process won't cause the company to take longer
to get products to the market.
   Overall, however, the union's apparent willingness to
accept income guarantees and better retirement packages in
lieu of jobs reflects a growing realism among UAW officials
as the U.S. auto industry braces for tough economic times and
intense competition.
   "There's only one form of job security; and that's to
build a good product that people will buy," said George
Sailer, who represents some 4,300 UAW members at a GM engine
parts plant in Toledo, Ohio.
   Now that Mr. Sailer and about 400 other UAW leaders from
GM factories around the nation have approved the tentative
pact, the package will go to GM's UAW membership, who will
vote on it by Sept. 30.

   The proposed UAW-GM contract expands and sweetens the
options for workers who want to leave GM, and gives a bigger
cushion to those who lose their jobs:
                                                                                                       

   "Pre-retirement Leaves" -- Older workers can go on "leave"
at 85% of regular pay until eligible for retirement.
                                                                                                       

   30-and-Out -- Annual pensions for workers under age 62 who
retire with 30 years seniority will rise 20% by 1992 to
$21,600 from $18,000 now. Monthly benefits for those retiring
at 62 or older will rise 16-17% over three years.
                                                                                                       

   Early retirement -- Benefits for those with less than 30
years on the job who want to retire rise by 17%. Minimum
early retirement age drops.
                                                                                                       

   Voluntary Termination of Employment Program -- Workers too
young to retire will get an additional $3,000 to $7,000 plus
six months of health benefits to leave GM.
                                                                                                       

   Jobs Bank -- Workers laid off for more than 36 weeks
during the new three-year pact get full pay and benefits.
                                                                                                       

   Supplemental Unemployment Benefits -- Temporarily laid off
workers with less than 10 years seniority get 52 weeks at 95%
pay, up from 26 weeks. Laid-off workers with longer seniority
get up to three years of benefits, instead of two.

   MIAMI -- General Development Corp. said it reached a new
plea-bargain agreement with the government involving an
alleged conspiracy to defraud thousands of home buyers.
   The new agreement between the beleaguered real estate
developer and U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen calls for General
Development to make restitution to home buyers of as much as
$160 million over 25 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company's original plea bargain, which was rejected by
U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt in July, had called for
General Development to make restitution estimated at $80
million to $100 million. Judge Nesbitt said the first
agreement "didn't give her enough flexibility to determine an
appropriate sentence in light of the scope and severity of
the charges."
   The new agreement, according to a company spokeswoman,
calls for General Development to plead guilty to one count of
the original 16-count indictment against the company. That
count alleges that the company conspired to violate a federal
mail-fraud statute in connection with the sale of homes.
   In March, the U.S. attorney unsealed a 16-count indictment
against General Development and its financing unit, GDV
Financial Corp. The indictment, which culminated a two-year
grand jury investigation, alleged that the company had
schemed to sell its Florida homes, primarily to out-of-state
buyers unfamiliar with market conditions, at grossly inflated
prices based on improper appraisals.
   Prosecutors said 9,600 to 10,000 home buyers were
affected. The company's appraisals were based on what
prosecutors say were other overpriced General Development
homes -- not properties in the community at large -- and thus
exceeded fair-market value, prosecutors said.
   General Development, which filed for bankruptcy-law
protection in April, said the new agreement will be filed
today with the U.S. District Court and the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Miami.

   CBS Jumps to Lead
   In TV Ratings War
   On Opening Night

   NEW YORK -- CBS, the No. 3 network for three straight
years, had an unexpectedly strong showing Monday, the first
night of the 1990-91 prime time season.
   The television network unit of CBS Inc. won the night with
a 16.8 rating and a 27 share. ABC, a unit of Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., was second with a 14.7 rating and a 24
share, bolstered by its "Monday Night Football."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co.
and the top-rated network for five straight years, was in
last place with a 12.9 rating and a 21 share, despite the
debut of "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," a situation comedy that
NBC hoped would be a breakout hit. (A ratings point
represents 931,000 TV households; shares are the percentage
of sets in use.)
   CBS officials eagerly touted the network's victory,
specifically at 8 p.m. EDT, when "Uncle Buck," featuring
comedian Kevin Meany, beat "Fresh Price of Bel Air," starring
rap singer Will Smith. Both shows had their premiere Sept.
10, and on Monday, "Uncle Buck" rose 25% in the ratings from
the week before, while "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" fell 7%.
   The win comes despite the fact that "the advertising
industry wrote off our show and picked NBC's as the hit,"
said David F. Poltrack, a CBS senior vice president.
   However, NBC executives emphasized that its show won in
key demographic categories, including men and women 18 to 49
years old, that are most attractive to advertisers. The CBS
show was popular among adults 35 to 49 years old, as well as
those 50 years old and older.
   "`Fresh Prince' was designed for teens and young adults 18
to 34 years old," said Bob Niles, a senior vice-president at
NBC. "We won in the targeted demographic."
   CBS's Mr. Poltrack countered that "Uncle Buck" won in the
key demographic of adults 25 to 54 years old. The CBS show
had an 8 rating and NBC's show attracted a 7.5 rating. "We
want to build on a sophisticated audience of our other Monday
shows, `Murphy Brown' and `Designing Women,'" he said.
   Monday also was the kickoff of CBS's promotional contest
with K mart Corp., another factor that rivals said
contributed to the size of CBS's win. Next Monday, NBC begins
its "tune in to win" contest in conjunction with McDonald's
Corp.
   The win was a big morale booster for CBS. In the 1989-90
season, CBS usually only won Sunday night. "This is the first
of many surprises from CBS," according to Mr. Poltrack.
   Last week, the final week of the 1989-1990 season, the
season premiere of "60 Minutes," produced by CBS News, was
the top-rated show. "CBS Evening News with Dan Rather" didn't
fare as well. It trailed ABC's top-rated "World News Tonight
with Peter Jennings" by 1.4 ratings points, the 36th
consecutive week that it came in second. It was ahead of
third-place "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw" by only
four-tenths of a ratings point. The network news race is
usually much closer with three broadcasts separated by only
tenths of ratings points.
   "ABC News has continued to fortify its leadership,"
conceded Mr. Poltrack. "We didn't hold on to the audience we
attracted at the beginning" of the network's coverage of the
Middle East crisis, he said.

   Law:
   Judge Decides
   Big Lawyer Fee
   Is Out of Order

   The war against high legal costs gained a surprising ally
recently when a state judge in Massachusetts slashed a
lawyer's fee because he thought it was too high.
   The judge's unusual action, which enraged and worried
lawyers in Massachusetts, has sparked a fierce legal battle
that has now reached the state's highest court.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the judge's fee-cutting is upheld, the life of
contingency-fee lawyers (and their clients) may never be the
same.
   The controversy came when Alan R. Goodman, a Springfield,
Mass., attorney, appeared to hit the jackpot in settling a
personal injury case against Browning Ferris Industries Inc.
in December.
   A contingency fee contract with his client gave Mr.
Goodman one-third of the nearly $3 million award -- a tidy
$975,000. "He is entitled to be handsomely compensated for
what he accomplished," noted John F. Moriarty, the judge in
the Springfield trial.
   But not that handsomely, the judge concluded. Although
neither the client nor anyone else objected to the fee, Judge
Moriarty went on to conclude that it was "unreasonable and
excessive," so he reduced it by nearly 30%. Now attorneys
worry that the case will encourage other judges to
second-guess the terms of lawyer-client agreements.
   "There's not a lawyer in Massachusetts who doesn't know
about the case," says Mr. Goodman. "It's a hot issue."
   Mr. Goodman is hardly unbiased, but the Massachusetts Bar
Association says the decision already is creating confusion
about the validity of lawyer-client agreements, and the
standards to be used in future pacts. In a
friend-of-the-court brief seeking a reversal of the ruling,
it contends the decision will spark unnecessary litigation
over fees and prompt attorneys to demand even higher
contingency fees, or else avoid such arrangements.
   "The substantial adverse effects of this decision on
society, the courts, litigants and their attorneys must be
avoided," the association argues. The Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court heard oral arguments on the issue earlier this
month; its decision is pending.
   Contingency-fee pacts, under which an attorney agrees to
forgo fees if he loses but to take a hefty percentage --
typically 30% to 40% -- of his client's recovery if he wins,
is at the center of growing debate. Supporters say the system
enables less affluent plaintiffs to hire top trial lawyers,
which, they contend, is why doctors, corporations and
liability insurers -- frequent targets of suits seeking
damages -- keep trying to change the system.
   "They're trying to make it more difficult for an injured
person to obtain competent counsel," says Michael C. Maher,
an Orlando, Fla., attorney and president of the Association
of Trial Lawyers of America. "They want an uneven playing
field."
   Mr. Goodman says his client, Donald A. Gagnon, could never
have afforded a top attorney if required to pay by the hour,
the more traditional billing method. Mr. Gagnon was
permanently paralyzed from the waist down when he was struck
by a garbage truck owned by Browning-Ferris, a Houston-based
waste-handling company. For its defense, the company retained
a large Boston law firm, Martin, Magnuson, McCarthy &amp; Kenney.
   But critics insist the potentially high payoff of
contingency-fee arrangements encourages more lawsuits that
"puff up" damages, as Martin F. Conner, president of the
American Tort Reform Association, puts it. Moreover, they
argue, the all-or-nothing nature of the system prompts
plaintiffs lawyers to settle cases -- thus ensuring a fee --
even though it may not be in the best interests of their
clients.
   "In a system in which over 95% of cases are settled, the
whole notion of contingency looks a little odd," says Mr.
Conner. "We think it needs a lot more regulation -- along the
lines of what this judge apparently is doing."
   The push for such regulation has borne fruit. Some states,
including Massachusetts, already have adopted legislation
that imposes caps on such fees in medical malpractice cases.
And federal procedural rules authorize judges to regulate the
fairness of fees in certain types of litigation -- big class
actions, for instance, where plaintiffs lawyers sometimes
represent thousands of plaintiffs with claims totaling tens
of millions of dollars.
   In Brooklyn, N.Y., last month, U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein capped at 20% the fees that plaintiffs attorneys
can take from certain payments of health claims to asbestos
victims. Given the limited funds available to pay the
nationwide personal injury claims, it is "intolerable" that a
major portion has been going to legal fees, the judge said.
   But in other areas, regulation of fees is less clear,
leading to ad hoc actions such as Judge Moriarty's. The judge
said in his decision in February that a fee constituting
one-third of a damage award is "reasonable to a point," but
it gets less so as the size of the recovery increases. Even
if the state's medical malpractice cap were applied, Mr.
Goodman's fee would work out to be about $300 a hour, the
judge calculated, substantially less than his one-third fee
calculated on an hourly basis. The judge also noted that the
maximum compensation permitted for appointed counsel in
murder cases is $50 an hour.
   In the end, Judge Moriarty devised his own formula,
concluding that Mr. Goodman should be paid one-third of the
first $300,000 recovered, 25% of the next $1.2 million, and
20% of anything above $1.5 million.
   "At those rates, Mr. Goodman is entitled to an attorney's
fee of $695,000, which I consider to be handsome
compensation," Judge Moriarty declared. "Anything in excess
of that amount would be unreasonable and excessive."
   But Massachusetts attorneys insist Judge Moriarty went too
far, especially when no one had complained about Mr.
Goodman's fee. At a hearing to review the fee, Mr. Gagnon
testified he was satisfied with the arrangement, and with Mr.
Goodman's performance. Paul Keane, lead counsel for
Browning-Ferris, said he was impressed with Mr. Goodman's
work. Even the judge acknowledged that he worked "hard and
well" and achieved a "very favorable" result.
   "It's a very unusual situation," says Mr. Maher. "I've
never seen one like it before."
   In appealing Mr. Goodman's case to the state's supreme
court, Boston attorney Joseph W. Glannon contends a judge
shouldn't be revising a standard contingency-fee contract
when there isn't any question of fraud, and when the
arrangement has worked to the client's advantage. No one
argued in support of Judge Moriarty's decision.
   Although the outcome is unpredictable, legal experts say
the case will require the Massachusetts high court to balance
at least two fundamental concepts in American law. One is a
sort of inherent power of most judges to ensure that legal
fees are fair and reasonable. The other is a strong tendency
to respect contracts.
   Victor Schwartz, an attorney with Crowell &amp; Moring in
Washington, D.C., is one of those who favors more regulation
of contingency fees. But he suggests that legislative
remedies may be preferable to judicial intervention such as
this, at least partly because attorneys have a clearer idea
of what to expect.
   "If I'm going to get a speeding ticket," says Mr.
Schwartz, "I want to know what the speed limit is."

   Even as many magazine titles find their way to the
shredder, publishers are hoping that small business could
mean nicely sized profits.
   They're eagerly launching new books aimed at a growing
market, small-business owners, while advertising revenue
slips for much of the magazine industry.

   This year alone, Entrepreneur Inc., which publishes
Entrepreneur magazine, started Entrepreneurial Woman, and the
National Federation of Independent Business launched
Independent Business for its 560,000 members. Just this week,
American Express Co. is mailing the first copies of Your
Company to more than one million of its corporate
card-holders who run small businesses.
   In the three years ended last December, another 15
small-business publications started, says Samir Husni, a
University of Mississippi associate professor who publishes a
guide to new magazines.
   These publications seek to capitalize on the boom in
entrepreneurship spurred by the prosperity of the 1980s. The
ranks of newly incorporated businesses have grown at an
average 687,000 a year since 1985, up from 453,000 a year in
the late 1970s, says the U.S. Small Business Administration.
   The total number of non-farm businesses -- including
self-employed individuals and part-time entrepreneurs --
reached 20 million this year, up 54% since 1980. Among the
reasons for the growth: Waves of women with managerial
interests and laid-off corporate managers have been going
into business for themselves.
   But as magazines aimed at the small-business market
proliferate, they are changing strategy. Unlike many
publications started in the 1970s -- such as Inc. and
Entrepreneur -- the newcomers increasingly target specialized
audiences.
   For instance, some have aimed only at family-business
owners, Hispanic entrepreneurs, home-based operators,
franchisees or women. Rieva Lesonsky, editor in chief of both
Entrepreneur and Entrepreneurial Woman, says the women's
market until recently had "hardly been touched. We're the
only book that serves it." Entrepreneurial Woman says its
circulation has reached 200,000.
   Some publishers aim at newer entrepreneurs, while others
are geared toward more experienced owners. Entrepreneur
magazine's Ms. Lesonsky says Entrepreneur addresses an
audience of serious business operators who are younger than
the typical National Federation of Independent Business
member.
   Independent Business goes to NFIB members whose average
business has operated for 13 years and employs 15 people,
says Don Phillipson, editorial director. The
September-October issue features such articles as "Big
Customers: Selling to Big Business," "Tax Breaks for Your
Home Office" and "Offbeat Business: Inveterate Invertebrates
-- Ah, the Wonders of Worms."
   The fastest-growing segment of the field aims squarely at
small-business wannabees. These are often newsstand browsers
who dream of owning a business someday -- though many will
never get beyond the daydream stage. Nearly half of the
magazines entering the market in the 1987-89 period address
this market, with features describing "hot" new business
opportunities.
   Advertisers say the increasing specialization makes their
job easier. Bruce Mowery, director of small-business markets
for Apple Computer Inc., says the broadening array of
specialized magazines lets Apple target the small-business
markets it wants to stress.
   Nonetheless, these magazines haven't been immune to the
magazine industry's downturn this year. While Entrepreneur
has had nearly a 14% gain in advertising pages this year from
last, two market veterans -- Inc. and Success -- have
sustained advertising declines, says Steven Cohn, editor of
Media Industry Newsletter, a trade publication.
   New magazines -- which generally don't make money for
several years, if ever -- are finding it particularly rough
going this year. Family Business, a monthly begun late last
year for family-business owners, struggles along with about
10 ad pages an issue. "We're the new kid on the block, and in
this advertising environment, it's hard to sell yourself,"
says editor Stephen Solomon.
   Struggles for ad dollars convince some publishers that
there's a limit to just how thin they can slice the market.
Some fear niche marketing may get carried too far -- at least
by their competitors. Independent Business's Mr. Phillipson
calls Entrepreneurial Woman "a terrible idea." He contends
that the concerns of women business owners are much the same
as their male counterparts.
   Ms. Lesonsky, at Entrepreneurial Woman, insists women
still face problems raising money and gaining credibility
that men don't. Articles in the October issue include: "The
Enemy Within; Are You Sabotaging Your Own Success?" and
"Think Big; The Largest Barrier to Getting Venture Capital Is
Asking for Too Little."
   On the other hand, Ms. Lesonsky wonders if there is a big
enough audience for another magazine, Family Business. She
says family business owners are "business-owners first,
family members second."
   Family Business publisher Leonard Zweig counters that his
readers must grapple with issues that don't trouble
non-family business owners. Among other articles, the
magazine's October issue carries "The Reluctant Successor,"
chronicling a son's decision to leave the family business to
"pursue a different dream."
   Some companies think they can limit the risk by
"controlling" circulation -- generally, distributing the
magazine free to a targeted audience. Besides using its new
controlled-circulation magazine to promote its credit card,
American Express has signed on major advertisers such as
International Business Machines Corp. as a sponsor.
   Even with the current financial strains in the magazine
business, marketing experts see continued growth in the
small-business segment. Says Apple Computer's Mr. Mowery,
"Magazines that cater to the small-business audience are
flourishing right along with the small businesses."

   Inside Track:
   Time Warner
   Has a Bull
   For a Chief

   NEW YORK -- Steven V. Ross, chairman and chief executive
officer of Time Warner Inc., has been bottom-fishing the
sunken stock of the media and publishing conglomerate.
   Since July 23, Mr. Ross has spent almost $40 million on
Time Warner shares, according to insider filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The purchases arguably rank Mr. Ross as the most bullish
company chairman in the U.S. He has spent more money on
shares of his company than any other top corporate official
in the country so far this year, according to Invest/Net, a
North Miami, Fla., concern that tracks insider filings.
   But then, Mr. Ross has a lot of money. Under terms of
Time's takeover of Warner Communications Inc., Mr. Ross, then
Warner's chairman and chief executive, got $193 million,
which included compensation promised to him under his Warner
employment contract. He also got options for 1.8 million Time
Warner shares exercisable at $150 a share. The deal also
called for Mr. Ross to be guaranteed a base salary of
$800,000 a year for 10 years, plus bonuses.
   That 1989 takeover was controversial. Time, which had
already agreed to merge with Warner, rejected a sweetened
$200-a-share bid from Paramount Communications Inc. Back
then, Time stock hit a record high of $182.75. But since the
merger, the renamed Time Warner stock has plummeted to less
than half of that.
   In more than 70 separate purchases in late July and
August, Mr. Ross bought 175,000 Time Warner common shares for
an average of about $90 each, as well as 575,500 Class C and
Class D preferred shares at an average of about $41 each,
according to the company. The shares were purchased for his
trust account.
   So far, Mr. Ross's investment is under water. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Time Warner
common closed at $77.625, down 25 cents. The Class C shares
closed at $38.25, and the Class D, at $38.375.
   Mr. Ross declined to comment on his recent spending spree.
But at the company's 1990 annual meeting at New York's
Ziegfeld Theatre, Mr. Ross told shareholders who questioned
his salary that his stockholdings would ultimately prove even
more profitable.
   "I believe those 1.8 million shares of Time Warner stock
at $150 a share are going to make me more money than I've
ever made in my life," he said. At the time, Mr. Ross blamed
the stock's sharp decline on the potential re-regulation of
the cable-television industry. Time Warner is the parent
company of HBO, among other cable enterprises.
   A Time Warner spokeswoman said that Mr. Ross's decision to
buy the shares "speaks for itself."
   Jessica J. Reif, First Boston Corp. analyst, downgraded
the company to a "hold" recommendation from a "buy" in
February, citing Time Warner's $10.8 billion debt burden and
the risk that regulation of the cable or
television-syndication industries could harm those
businesses.
   Now, however, she says that "all the bad news is in the
stock" and that either of two developments could prompt her
to recommend its purchase -- a corporate restructing that
would sell units to reduce debt, or "benign" legislation from
Congress on regulation of the cable industry.
   All of Mr. Ross's purchases were made in the open market.
Top officials of companies more frequently buy by exercising
stock options -- but Mr. Ross's options for 1.8 million
shares at $150 each are all currently under water.

   HIGH RATINGS: Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom Inc.,
purchased $1.4 million of its stock in several trades in
August, according to SEC filings.
   Mr. Redstone, chairman of National Amusements Inc., the
majority shareholder in Viacom, has been aggressively
accumulating shares of the Dedham, Mass., media company for
roughly two years. But lately he has stepped up the pace of
his buying, he said, because of the stock's weakness.
   "All the stocks in the media industry took a hit, but I
think it was indiscriminate and not rational," he said. "The
drop of the stock does not reflect the operations of Viacom."
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Viacom's common closed at $19.75 a share, down 37.5 cents. It
traded above $32 a share last October.
   Mr. Redstone spent most of the money, about $846,000, on
Viacom's relatively new Class B nonvoting shares. The shares
were created in June, the company said, to allow greater
flexibility in acquisitions. Because some pension funds
cannot hold nonvoting stock, the Class B Viacom shares are
trading several points below the Class A, and "we see that as
irrational," Mr. Redstone said.
   Mr. Redstone paid an average of $19.68 a share for the
Class A common and $16.68 for the Class B, according to SEC
filings. The Class B shares closed at $17.875, unchanged, in
composite trading yesterday on the Amex.
   The purchases increased his and National Amusements' huge
stake in the company by less than 0.1%.

   NEW YORK -- Stock and bond prices swung wildly, dragged
down at first by the latest economic data and then pulled
back up by rumors of a budget accord.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 3.96 rise to
2571.29, after being down as much as 34 points in the
morning. Bonds ended flat, recovering from a decline of
nearly a half of a point, or almost $5 for each $1,000 of
face amount. The dollar, which had lost ground steadily for a
week, also started lower but rebounded in a wave of
profit-taking in the yen and mark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was an unspectacular
141,130,000 shares, but it was the busiest day in three weeks
and much brisker than Monday's anemic 110,600,000 shares.
   Indicating the stock market's vulnerability to rumors,
shares of Chase Manhattan plunged as much as 2 on talk that
the banking concern was having trouble placing its commercial
paper. Chase denied it, and the stock rebounded, ending at
15, down 7/8.
   "It shows you how people are jumpy on any type of news,
not wanting to be the last guy off a sinking ship," said Paul
Hennessey, head of equities trading at Boston Co. "It's the
fear thing. That's when people start throwing stocks away."
   All financial markets were hurt early in the day on news
that the July trade deficit had widened more than expected
and that so-called core inflation -- the consumer price index
not including energy and food -- was stronger than predicted.
   The overall CPI for August rose 0.8% -- or 9.6% on an
annualized basis -- bringing the annual inflation rate so far
this year to 6.2%. However, core inflation rose a
stronger-than-expected 0.5%. The trade deficit widened to
$9.33 billion instead of the expected $7.6 billion.
   Both stocks and bonds, however, turned the corner and
headed higher on rumors that an agreement to cut the U.S.
budget deficit was imminent. Even so, oil remains the
dominant influence in stocks, said Ted Eggert, equity
research manager at Yamaichi International. Yesterday, oil
prices retreated; the October oil-futures contract edged down
22 cents to close at $33.41 a barrel.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose, but declining issues on the New York
Stock Exchange led advancers, 854 to 626.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 9.06%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5530 marks and 137.85 yen, compared with
1.5480 marks and 136.55 yen Monday.

   ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- UNC Inc. said its UNC Support Services
unit received three military contracts valued at about $183
million over the next 15 years.
   The company won a U.S. Navy contract for on-site support
and maintenance of 140 TH-57 helicopters and equipment. The
contract is for $28.6 million in the first year, and about
$28.2 million annually in the following three years.

   UNC Support Services also won a five-year, $7 million
simulator-instructor training contract from the U.S. Air
Force. The award has four one-year options, at a value of
about $1.3 million per year.
   In addition, UNC Support Services will be part of a team
to work on the Air Force's Special Operations Forces Aircrew
Training System program in Akron, Ohio. The 15-year contract
is worth about $65 million.
   UNC services aircraft engines and components, manufactures
jet engine parts and provides other services to the aviation
industry.

   Pentagon Begins to Reduce Presence
   Of Troops Abroad, Mainly in Europe

   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon, starting a gradual process of
paring down the huge U.S. Cold-War troop presence abroad,
said it will eliminate or reduce operations at 150 mostly
small foreign sites, mainly in Europe.
   The cutbacks are designed to carry out earlier pledges to
shrink the size of the armed forces in response to budget
cuts, and to meet force reductions that will be required in
Europe under the conventional arms control treaty expected to
be signed in November. That treaty will require the U.S., the
U.S.S.R., and 21 other countries to reduce the number of
their tanks and other weapons in Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Defense officials said the closings aren't connected with
the current U.S. troop buildup in Saudi Arabia, which is
designed to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Indeed,
administration officials said the bases closings would be so
gradual that they wouldn't free any significant number of
troops for use in the Persian Gulf any time soon.
   The closings will take place slowly over several years,
starting with the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   "It's partly a matter of the obvious changing situation,"
said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. "As the threat changes
in Eastern Europe, as the Soviet forces pull back, as Eastern
European governments change, become democratically elected,
clearly the nature of our deployments in . . . Europe changes
as well."
   Mr. Williams added that "the second thing we have to
contend with is declining budgets in future years."
   The 150 military "sites" range from tiny support posts to
large air bases, but don't include any of the most important
U.S. combat bases in the heart of central Europe. The largest
affected installations are three air bases: Torrejon in
Spain, and Lindsey and Hessich Oldendorf in West Germany. All
150 sites are clustered around 44 locations, the Pentagon
said.
   The Pentagon declined to estimate the number of troops
that will be withdrawn from Europe as a result of the
cutbacks, nor the costs involved. Officials said some troops
serving at the affected sites might simply be moved to others
in the U.S. or abroad.
   The announcement is certain to be welcomed in Moscow,
which is pulling all its troops out of Europe and had been
pressing the administration to make a unilateral statement of
its own intentions.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.), chairwoman of the house
subcommittee on military installations, called the list
"disappointing." She said "these sites include gas stations
on the autobahn, isolated housing units and athletic fields,
and sites which had long ago been slated for closure.
Facilities like these are closed every day at bases in the
U.S."
   The Pentagon doesn't require congressional approval to
close the foreign facilities, as it would if they were
located in the U.S.

   IRVING, Texas -- Integra-A Hotel &amp; Restaurant Co.said it
exercised its option to redeem its 13 1/2% bonds due 1993.
The owner and operator of hotels said it has issued $8.5
million in principal amount of the bonds. Integra said
redemption of the bonds is made possible by the agreement of
ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc., a former Integra subsidiary, to
prepay $3 million on certain debts it owes to Integra.
   The bonds originally were issued as units of certain
Integra warrants that entitled the holders to buy 23.5 common
shares at 30 cents a share. Those warrants aren't being
redeemed and as of Sept. 30, they are transferable separate
and apart from the bonds, the company said.

   Bondholders other than Hallwood Group Inc., which holds
about $6.9 million of the bonds, will be paid in full in
cash, Integra said. For its holdings, Hallwood will receive
about $1.4 million in cash and an assignment from Integra of
certain remaining debts owed to the company by ShowBiz Pizza.

   Charles J. Many
   Is Expected to Get
   Nynex Belgian Job

   Nynex Corp., signaling a more aggressive posture overseas,
is expected to name Charles J. Many to head a new
international office in Brussels, Belgium.
   Mr. Many, president of Nynex Mobile Communications, the
company's cellular unit, has a reputation within the cellular
industry as a tenacious executive with a keen interest in
marketing. He has also been a driving force in Nynex Mobile's
push into emerging cellular technologies. Earlier this
summer, for instance, Nynex announced plans to build a
personal communications network in Manhattan based on a
technology called code division multiple access, or CDMA,
which allows many more simultaneous conversations than other
technologies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Like other Baby Bells, Nynex is playing catch-up with San
Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group, which teamed with
European partners to win an important contract to build and
operate a cellular system in Germany. Although Nynex and its
U.K. partners aggressively pursued cable television
franchises in the U.K., the company's European business
largely consists of computer software sales and consulting.
   A Nynex spokesman declined to comment on reports that Mr.
Many would soon be transferred to Europe, and Mr. Many wasn't
available. The spokesman acknowledged that the company is
positioning itself to take advantage of twin forces at work
in the global telecommunications market: privatization and
deregulation. "We're very serious about international
markets," the spokesman said. Important parts of that
strategy, he said, are cellular and data communications. In
April, Nynex set up a Worldwide Information &amp; Cellular
Services Group, headed by Ivan G. Seidenberg, a corporate
executive vice president.
   The company is expected to make other executive changes,
including naming Mr. Many's successor at Nynex Mobile and
reorganizing Materiel Enterprises Co., the purchasing arm for
New York Telephone and New England Telephone, people familiar
with the situation said.
   Overseas operations last year accounted for only a small
fraction of Nynex's $13.2 billion in revenue. But the company
has said that it is counting on foreign ventures to bring in
as much as 20% of its revenue by the end of the decade.
   "The fact that Nynex has chosen a cellular guy is good,"
said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. "The only
thing that makes sense in Europe is cellular as opposed to
becoming some minority partner in a land-line network."
   Mr. Many, a native of New York City, joined Bell
Laboratories in 1960 and held several management positions
before moving in 1975 to New York Telephone, where he held
jobs in management information systems, networking and
marketing. From there, he moved to Nynex Business Information
Systems Co., holding jobs as vice president of sales, vice
president of new ventures and vice president of marketing. He
became president of Nynex Mobile in 1986, and has briefly
been chairman of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, the main trade group for the cellular industry.

   Loral Corp. Will Sell
   Ford Aerospace Unit
   To the Carlyle Group

   NEW YORK -- Loral Corp. said it will sell the BDM
International unit of Ford Aerospace to the Carlyle Group,
calling the sale "an exception" to its promise to keep the
newly acquired company intact.
   Under terms, Carlyle, a Washington merchant banking firm
that in July lost to Loral in a bidding contest for Ford
Aerospace, will purchase BDM for $130 million, including $115
million in cash and the balance in notes and warrants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   BDM's 3,100 employees will be offered partial ownership of
the company, although an internal memo said details of the
equity agreement wouldn't be made available until the sale is
formalized, probably by mid-October.
   "Certainly we would have liked to get all of Ford
Aerospace, but life goes on," said a Carlyle executive.
"We're happy that we wound up with at least a piece."
   BDM, based in McLean, Va., is a professional services
firm, performing strategic planning and analysis; about 90%
of its work is for the Pentagon.
   Ford Aerospace, a Ford Motor Co. unit, bought BDM in 1988
for $425 million -- a price that many have said was too high,
given BDM's $350 million in annual revenue and $20 million in
earnings.
   And since then, the downturn in U.S. military spending has
only undercut the market value for all defense properties.
Indeed, Loral won all of Ford Aerospace for only $715
million, plus the promise to let Ford Motor keep $100 million
from the unit's overfunded pension plan.
   Former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, a Carlyle Group
vice chairman, will become BDM chairman. Earle Williams, the
BDM chief executive officer since 1972, will remain in that
post.
   Loral, a defense electronics company, said it sold BDM
because of an inherent conflict in having one unit that
advises the Pentagon on the kinds of weapons it needs, as
well as other outfits that actually make arms. "BDM told us
that it inhibited their growth under Ford Aerospace," Loral
Chairman Bernard Schwartz said. "We think we could have
managed the situation, but at the end of the day it just
wasn't worth it."

   Hong Kong supermarkets withdrew thousands of packets of
M&amp;Ms chocolates after an anonymous letter warned that a
packet had been poisoned to protest the manufacturer's
support of the Asian Games in Beijing.
   Dairy Farm Ltd., owner of the Wellcome supermarket chain,
said stocks of the candy were being cleared from shelves and
returned to the importers, Effem Foods Inc. of Hong Kong. A
spokesman for Effem Foods said: "We have asked for all
supplies to be withdrawn and returned. We will replace them
with fresh supplies and will check the returned stock to see
if there is indeed a rogue packet."
   Effem Foods, which imports the candy from Australia, where
it is made by Mars of Australia, said it received the letter
Monday warning that a packet of the candy had been
contaminated with sodium cyanide. The letter condemned
Beijing for its crackdown on dissent last year and said the
manufacturer was supporting China by sponsoring the Asian
Games, which begin Sept. 22.
   Said a police spokesman: "We are taking this seriously,
but we have not reached any conclusions yet."
                                                                                                       

   KUWAIT AIRWAYS KEEPS FLYING
                                                                                                       

   Kuwait's national airline has moved its headquarters to
Cairo and will start operating from the Egyptian capital next
month, a Kuwait Airways official said. Abdel-Razzak al-Otaki,
manager of the Egypt office, said eight Boeing planes that
were outside Kuwait when Iraq invaded his country on Aug. 2
would be used in the Cairo-based operation. "The main goal is
to keep the Kuwaiti flag flying in foreign capitals and
countries," he said. Iraq on Monday ordered the dissolution
of Kuwait Airways and transferred all its assets to Iraqi
Airways.
                                                                                                       

   PANAMA TO SUBSIDIZE GASOLINE
                                                                                                       

   Panama will not increase gasoline prices but will pay $20
million more for imported oil this year, President Guillermo
Endara said. "After studying all options, we have decided
that, until December 31 and depending on the price per barrel
remaining at $28, the government will assume the increase,"
the president said. Panama's average gasoline price is now
$1.98 per gallon.

   Qantas Airways is adding flights to Hong Kong and London
from Australia in its winter schedule for the Northern
Hemisphere. Australia's national carrier said it would
increase flights to London to 14 from 12 a week; all will use
Boeing 747 aircraft. Flights to Hong Kong from Australia will
increase to 14 from eight a week, using Boeing 747 and Boeing
767-300 aircraft. The extra flights boost passenger capacity
to Hong Kong from Australia by 38% and to London by 16%. The
new schedule begins Oct. 28.
                                                                                                       

   ARGENTINA'S DOLLAR ECONOMY
                                                                                                       

   Argentina's Economy Ministry is set to approve checking
accounts in U.S. dollars as well as the austral, Buenos Aires
newspapers reported. The dollar already is Argentina's backup
currency, used for such purposes as renting and buying
apartments and paying for goods in many stores. Approval of
dollar checking accounts "will be implemented . . . within a
period of 10 days," La Nacion reported, citing an Economy
Ministry source.

   Welsh miners voted to accept the closing of the Mardy
mine, the last coal pit in the Rhondda Valley.
   British Coal's decision to close the mine by Christmas, 10
months ahead of schedule, ends an industrial saga that made
Rhondda's name synonymous with mining before recession hit
the industry. "It is . . . a very sad day for everybody
here," said National Union of Mineworkers local Chairman Mike
Richards.
   Mardy's 300 workers accepted layoff payments or transfers
to the five surviving pits elsewhere in the South Wales coal
field. Said Mr. Richards: "Young men are going to find it
very difficult to get other jobs because there is such a lack
of industry in the area."
   The government has launched a program to revitalize the
area. Waste heaps are being flattened to make way for
high-technology factories the government hopes will cut
unemployment, running at more than 20% in some towns.

   Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello traveled to
the Amazon yesterday to order the sealing up of a
1,050-foot-deep hole built by the air force and suitable for
nuclear tests. A presidential spokesman was quoted as saying
that Mr. Collor "has a vigorous position against these tests,
and for this reason ordered the shaft to be rendered
unusable." . . . In his annual state-of-the-world report,
United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
warned that the organization was stretched to the limit in
funds and manpower. "We have funds for only 24 further days
of operation," he said.

   On Use of RICO in Civil Lawsuits

   WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee approved a
bill that would restrict the use of the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law in civil lawsuits.
   The legislation, approved yesterday on a voice vote, would
leave intact the RICO law's criminal provisions, but it would
limit the ability of private parties to brand their courtroom
opponents as "racketeers" and seek triple damages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An unusual coalition of business groups and the American
Civil Liberties Union has tried for years to curb RICO,
arguing that a law designed to target organized-crime
syndicates has become a common weapon in garden-variety
commercial disputes. Consumer advocates and some liberal
legislators have opposed revising RICO, contending that it is
an effective weapon against white-collar fraud in areas such
as the crippled savings-and-loan industry.
   The bill would make revisions generally considered to be
more moderate than those called for in legislation approved
in February by the Senate Judiciary Committee. It remains
unclear, according to Capitol Hill aides, whether proponents
of limits on RICO will be able to iron out differences and
get a compromise approved by both houses before Congress
adjourns this fall.
   The House version, promoted as a compromise, would make
federal judges "gatekeepers" for RICO, permitting its use
only if certain conditions are met. Specifically, judges
could allow a private RICO suit if the plaintiff alleges
"egregious criminal conduct" and the claim involves a
previous criminal conviction. To permit such a suit, judges
also would have to find that the defendant was "a major
participant" in criminal conduct and that the potent
triple-damage remedy is needed to deter future egregious
criminal acts.
   Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), who has led opposition to
the bill, warned that it would "diminish legal remedies for
citizens in the S&amp;L failures, where we have the biggest
economic scandal in American history."
   The House panel approved an amendment offered by one of
the bill's sponsors, Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), that was
intended to address concerns about weakening RICO as a weapon
in lawsuits involving S&amp;Ls. The amendment would create a
legal presumption that a defendant had engaged in "egregious
criminal conduct" if his alleged injury to the plaintiff
involved a financial loss suffered by an S&amp;L that fails.
   But Pamela Gilbert of the Washington consumer-advocacy
group Public Citizen called the amendment "purely cosmetic,"
because under the House version a judge would still have to
find that a defendant was a "major participant" in criminal
conduct to allow a RICO suit involving an S&amp;L-related loss.
That requirement "would let off all the accountants and
lawyers and investment bankers responsible for a lot of the
{thrift} failures," Ms. Gilbert said.
   In two major differences from the House version, the
Senate bill doesn't include the "gatekeeper" provisions, but
it would eliminate triple damages in almost all instances.
The Senate's proposed revisions in RICO would apply to
lawsuits filed only after the law's enactment. The House
Judiciary Committee addressed that issue by passing an
amendment that would make limitations on RICO applicable six
months after the law's enactment.

   SECESSION LAW gets approval from New York's highest court.
   The ruling by the New York Court of Appeals will allow the
borough of Staten Island to begin a cumbersome process that
could lead to its secession from New York City.
   In November, Staten Islanders will get to vote on whether
to establish a commission to study the secession issue. But
state legislators cautioned that even if the borough's
residents ultimately vote to secede, it is unlikely the
city's least populous borough will ever leave New York City.
The state Legislature must approve the secession and is
considered unlikely to do so.
   Interest in secession has grown since last year's U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that the city's Board of Estimate, which
gave the borough an equal voice in the city's governance,
violated the one-person one-vote principle. Some residents
fear that Staten Island, with only 400,000 residents, will
not get its fair share of city services under the newly
enacted city charter. New York City officials have opposed
the law allowing for a secession referendum.
   If this November's proposal passes, a commission will have
three years to recommend whether secession is the best thing
for the borough. If a secession referendum then passes, the
borough may vote on whether to secede, and then leave it to
the Legislature to make its decision.
   "Should Staten Island secede it could pose enormous
problems for the city," said Michael Johnston, who follows
municipal finance for Moody's Investors Service Inc. "It
seems premature to be overly concerned about it, however."

   BUYER OF PROPERTY gains new weapon in conflict over waste
cleanup.
   U.S. District Judge D. Brock Hornby of Portland, Maine,
refused to dismiss a claim by Hanlin Group Inc., seeking to
hold the seller of a manufacturing plant liable for an
environmental cleanup.
   In 1982, Hanlin purchased the plant in Orrington, Maine,
from International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corp., now known as
Imcera Group Inc. Four years later, the Environmental
Protection Agency said the site was contaminated with
hazardous waste and ordered Hanlin to undertake a cleanup, as
required under the federal Resource Conservation Recovery
Act. Enacted in 1976, the act holds the owner of a site
liable for the cleanup of hazardous waste.
   Hanlin, a closely held Edison, N.J., chemical
manufacturer, sued International Minerals, alleging the
company was strictly liable for any cleanup costs because it
had caused the contamination. The ruling last week upholds a
decision by a federal magistrate allowing Hanlin to proceed
on the claim.
   Under the doctrine of strict liability, a defendant
engaged in an activity considered to be abnormally dangerous
may be held liable for damages, regardless of whether the
defendant was negligent.
   Typically, the strict-liability doctrine has allowed
people living near a contaminated site to seek compensation
for damage to their property. Maine is only the second state
to rule that the doctrine is not limited to neighboring
landowners and can be used by purchasers against sellers of
contaminated property. An earlier New Jersey case is pending
in the state's supreme court.
   Under an agreement signed with the Environmental
Protection Agency, Hanlin estimates it will spend $3 million
to $4 million just to study the extent of contamination at
the site, says John J. O'Leary Jr., a lawyer for Hanlin.
Cleaning up an average site can often run as high as $100
million.
   Andrew Schlickman of the Chicago firm Sidley &amp; Austin, a
lawyer for Imcera, said the Northbrook, Ill., company had not
decided whether to seek further review of the decision.

   MANVILLE TRUST formally asks court to authorize class
action for claims.
   In its motion, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
the trust said it has inadequate funds to pay all the
personal-injury claims against it. The motion was expected,
as part of U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein's efforts to come up
with a nationwide approach to settling many of the thousands
of asbestos claims now pending in the courts.
   The trust was formed in 1988 as part of the
bankruptcy-court reorganization plan of Manville Corp. to pay
asbestos personal-injury claims against the company.
   Eagle-Picher Industries Inc., another former asbestos
maker, has made a similar motion before Judge Weinstein. As
many as five other defendants, including the Manville trust,
have been expected to join Eagle-Picher in that process.
Eventually, a single claims-processing facility could be set
up by the court to pay those claims.

   XEROX CORP. wins reversal of jury verdict in
discrimination suit.
   A federal judge in Dallas overruled a jury verdict that
awarded $9 million to a woman who claimed she was made a
victim of fraud, age and sex discrimination by Xerox.
   In his ruling Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Sidney
Fitzwater said Elizabeth Layman's claims against her former
employer weren't supported by the evidence. Ms. Layman, who
had worked for Xerox in Dallas, alleged that Xerox in 1986
fraudulently promised to find her a job in California.
   Xerox said it had in fact offered Ms. Layman, 48 years
old, two jobs in California, both at higher pay than her
Dallas job, but that she rejected them as inferior and chose
instead to resign and file suit.
   Attorneys in the case said Ms. Layman is expected to
appeal.

   DEFENSE LAWYER can be compelled to testify on fees,
appeals court rules.
   Federal prosecutors had sought to require Mike DeGeurin, a
prominent Houston criminal-defense lawyer, to testify about
the fees he received for defending a man charged with
possession of cocaine. Suspecting Mr. DeGeurin's bill is
being paid with drug money, prosecutors had subpoenaed him
last September to testify before a federal grand jury
investigating his client.
   Two U.S. Supreme Court rulings in June 1989 gave
prosecutors wide authority to seize assets of accused
criminals, including funds needed to pay lawyers' fees. But a
federal district judge blocked the subpoena of Mr. DeGeurin,
saying that it could turn him into a witness against his own
client. Last Friday, a three-judge panel of the federal
appeals court in New Orleans reversed that decision but
delayed issuing a written opinion.
   Although Mr. DeGeurin's client already has been sentenced
to prison, prosecutors are pressing for the attorney's
testimony anyway, because they believe the fees were paid by
a third person involved in illegal drugs. "There is no
attorney-client privilege there," says Larry Finder, an
assistant U.S. attorney in Houston.
   Mr. DeGeurin's attorney, brother Dick DeGuerin, says he
won't know the scope of the court's ruling until a written
opinion is produced. If his client in fact is compelled to
testify, he says, "that's a disaster -- and very discouraging
for practicing lawyers."

   Marketing:
   Tire Makers Are Traveling Bumpy Road
   As Car Sales Fall, Foreign Firms Expand

   MONROEVILLE, Pa. -- Heidi Fortwangler needed tires for her
car and dreaded the purchase. "I don't like to spend money on
tires because you can't eat them or wear them," she
complained.
   So when Mrs. Fortwangler arrived at a Tire America shop
here, one of her main concerns was not spending more than
$100 for two tires. She got her wish when the store manager
recommended a house brand tire priced at $27 each.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "All most people care about is the price and how long it
will take for us to put them on," says store manager Timothy
Yowan. In the past six years, he adds, he has noticed a
falloff in loyalty to particular brands, especially as
technological advances have improved tire quality and blurred
the differences between premium and budget-priced tires.
   Stores like Tire America, a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,
offer a wide selection of tires that can deliver as much as
40,000 miles of driving at inexpensive prices. "For the
consumer, it's the best time in my 25 years in the business,"
says Thomas J. Reese, executive vice president of sales and
marketing at General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., a unit of Continental
AG of West Germany.
   But it's a tough time to be a tire maker. With auto sales
declining, the market for original equipment has dwindled,
making competition fiercer in the replacement market. At the
same time, a spate of foreign tire makers, which have gobbled
up most U.S. producers, are seeking to expand their presence
here. Pirelli S.p.A.'s bid to acquire Continental, announced
earlier this week, is expected to tighten the market even
more.
   The result: razor-thin profit margins. Many producers have
dumped inventories of tires slated for auto makers into the
replacement market, lowering prices. In addition, they have
focused heavily on low-priced tires that don't earn them
hefty profits but are one of the few growing markets.
"Pricing has been horrid and the mood in this business very
uneasy," says Edward Kalail, a spokesman at General Tire.
   Even companies that once snubbed the low-priced market are
vying for a foothold.
   Groupe Michelin of France began competing here this year
through its acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., a
producer of private label tires and some flag brands.
Michelin, also hurt by a pricing war involving original
equipment tires in Europe, is now predicting three or four
difficult years ahead.
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., long known for its
premium-priced tires, this year at great expense rolled out a
line called the All-American Decathlon, priced between $27
and $45 and advertised for budget-minded drivers. A step up
are two lines of tires called Concordes priced from $24 to
around $55. Analysts estimate that profit margins on the
lower-end tires are in the 8% to 10% range, compared with 25%
to 30% for a Goodyear premium priced tire.
   Goodyear unveiled the cheaper tires because its dealers
were being clobbered by stores carrying lots of brands at
various prices. The company's strategy is to use the new
tires to attract a broader range of customers to its
dealerships. Tire buyers have to pay anywhere from $86.25 for
an Eagle ST to $424.40 for a Corvette high-speed tire that
bears the Goodyear name.
   "These {new} tires will allow our retailers to broaden
their appeal to every driver in the American household," Al
Eastwood, Goodyear's general marketing manager for consumer
products, said at introduction. "When it comes to
price-oriented buyers, we've not been at the party."
   Goodyear has reclaimed about 3% of the replacement market
it lost in recent years. But analysts believe Goodyear has
been losing money on some of its lower-priced lines. Recently
Goodyear said it expects to post a record quarterly loss --
$65 million in the third quarter after charges.
   Competitors also claim that Goodyear's plan could backfire
because consumers might purchase the cheaper tires at the
expense of Goodyear's branded lines. To avoid that, Goodyear,
whose officials declined to be interviewed for this article,
has unleashed an image advertisement campaign with the theme:
"The best tires in the world have Goodyear written all over
them."
   On the other hand, some tire makers have already conceded
that their flagship brands don't have the marketing pull with
consumers that they once had. As a result, tire makers such
as General Tire don't even bother with image advertising.
   "If you think you can glamorize tires to make sales,
you're kidding yourself," says General's Mr. Reese, who
previously held a similar position at Firestone. "We're
dealing with a product that nobody wants to buy," he says,
adding that many motorists "think of tires as nothing more
than a tax for driving."
   Customers agree. At the Tire America shop here, Richard
Jungo rubs his fingers over the treads of several tires and
compares the prices listed in ads from Tire America and its
competitors. "I don't stick to any particular brand because
I've tried them all and they're pretty much the same," he
says.
   General sells a substantial number of replacement tires at
bargain prices through Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and has been
buying stakes in independent dealerships in an effort to
increase tire distribution. At the same time General Tire
advertises regionally in cooperation with dealers. The ads
stress pricing, service and warranties.
   One of the major benefactors of changes in the replacement
market is Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co., the only U.S. company
besides Goodyear that wasn't acquired by a foreign owner
during recent industry consolidation.
   Unlike its much larger counterparts, Cooper ignores the
original equipment market. Instead, the Findlay, Ohio-based
Cooper focuses on being a low-cost producer.
   It has been able to expand capacity and remodel equipment
at as much as half the cost paid by competitors like
Goodyear. Also, when the original-equipment market was
booming several years ago, many of the brand tire makers cut
back on private-label brands to increase supplies to auto
makers. Cooper, in turn, picked up a considerable
private-label business.
   Now its output is about evenly split between its own
brands and private-label tires for retailers such as Sears,
Western Auto and Tire America. The private-label tires don't
include any marketing costs, so retailers can usually price
them below branded tires of similar quality.
   "About 10% of consumers are very image conscious and
another 10% to 15% are very price conscious -- they own a
1976 Oldsmobile that runs forever," says a Cooper spokesman.
"But the bulk of motorists are value conscious. They want a
good, standard tire for 8,000 miles a year."
   The Middle East crisis could add to tire makers' problems.
Increased gasoline prices, for example, might force some
motorists to cut back on driving, which could crimp
replacement-tire sales. Also, a typical tire is made out of
the equivalent of six to eight gallons of crude oil, so
margins could be squeezed even more as a result of higher raw
material costs.
   But tire makers are trying to recoup some of these
additional costs and halt the price war. This summer, some
producers announced price increases of 4% to 5% that appear
to be sticking; a second similar increase will take effect
next month. For consumers, that suggests that now is the time
to buy tires for the family sedan.

   House Votes to Restrict Textile Imports,
   But Backing for Veto Override Is Weak

   WASHINGTON -- The House passed legislation to restrict
textile imports by a 271-149 vote, a margin that indicates
there may be insufficient support to override President
Bush's expected veto.
   Backers of the bill need a two-thirds majority of those
voting in the 435-member House, or at least 280 votes in
yesterday's case, to override a presidential veto of the
bill, which would hold textile import quotas at current
levels for one year and limit future increases to 1% a year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In capitals around the world, the textile bill is seen as
a barometer of protectionist sentiment in the U.S. That's
partly because the measure has become a focus for opposition
in this country to the current round of international
negotiations on reforming the world's trade treaty, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The Bush administration, arguing that the U.S. needs open
markets to sell its goods overseas, has set successful
completion of the GATT talks as its top trade priority. The
trade talks are named the "Uruguay Round" because they began
in that country in 1986.
   "Enactment of the bill would almost certainly kill the
Uruguay Round of trade negotiations," says William Cline, a
senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a
Washington-based think tank. In a recent letter to House
Speaker Thomas Foley, Secretary of State James Baker warned
that the proposed legislation would directly violate 38
existing trade agreements.
   Recalling the protectionist legislation that preceded the
Great Depression, Mr. Cline termed the textile bill "the
Smoot-Hawley tariff act of the 1990s." He estimated that it
would cost consumers $5 billion in 1992. The cost would total
$48 billion by 2000, he said.
   The textile lobby, led by the American Textile
Manufacturers Institute, has argued strongly for the
legislation. It claims that imports of textiles and apparel
are harming the domestic industry, even though it conceded
such imports grew only 2.2% in the first seven months of 1990
compared with the same period a year earlier.
   "The overwhelming House vote in favor of the textile bill
shows that Congress believes very strongly that the time has
come for our government to slow down the flood of imports
threatening one of our most basic and essential industries,"
said the textile group's president, Donald Hughes.
   A coalition of retailers, apparel manufacturers, importers
and other freer-trade interests has gathered to oppose the
measure. "Today's vote, which failed to receive a two-thirds
majority, indicates that shortsighted, costly, special
protection doesn't always carry the day in the U.S.
Congress," said Ronni Nass, a director of the American
Association of Exporters and Importers and vice president for
imports at McCrory Corp., a New York-based retailer.
   The Senate this July passed the textile legislation by a
68-32 margin -- more than the two-thirds majority needed to
override a presidential veto. Since then, the Bush
administration has campaigned against the bill. Now that the
House has acted, Mr. Bush is expected to carry out his veto
threat soon.
   The textile industry has pushed similar legislation
previously. In September 1988, the House voted 248-150 to
override a presidential veto, failing to muster a two-thirds
majority.
   The administration has bombarded Congress with arguments
against the current bill. Michael Boskin, chairman of the
president's Council of Economic Advisers, recently told Rep.
Philip Sharp (D., Ind.) that the legislation would cost
American consumers $30 billion over five years. He said this
burden would fall most heavily on lower income families that
spend a higher fraction of their household budgets on
clothing and other affected items.
   While the bill might add jobs in the textile industry, the
cost would be about $70,000 a job, Mr. Boskin argued. "The
legislation taxes U.S. consumers and the retail industry in
order to subsidize the textiles industry," Mr. Boskin wrote.

   Japan Inc. is trying harder to promote an all-American
identity for its U.S. operations.
   Japanese manufacturers long have preferred
product-oriented advertising. That has been a fairly easy
sell here, considering Japanese goods' reputation for quality
and reliability.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But now, worried about growing anti-Japanese sentiment,
more Japanese companies are mounting or planning broad
corporate-image advertising in the U.S. for the first time.
Among them: Canon, Honda Motor, Panasonic, Sony and Toyota
Motor.
   The firms want to woo consumers by stressing their
expanded range of American-made products and roles as good
U.S. corporate citizens. A Panasonic campaign that begins
next month, for instance, will tie its products to vignettes
about American life. To further raise their U.S. profile and
better coordinate marketing efforts, a handful of Japanese
concerns such as Sanyo and Toshiba also have opened Manhattan
headquarters offices for their U.S. operations since 1989.
   The new push could help allay popular resentment of
Japan's massive American acquisitions spree, seen in the
recent rash of Japan-bashing ads. The drives also could
deflect further tensions as the U.S. economy deteriorates.
Japanese corporations "are running out and spending {ad}
money just as an inoculation" against greater pro-America
fervor, says one advertising agency executive who is crafting
image ads for a major Japanese client. They fear
"intensification of anti-Japanese feeling," he adds.
   Such concerns persuaded Honda to prepare its first
large-scale image campaign in America, a nearly $10 million
effort set to break this Friday in USA Today and The Wall
Street Journal. The 12 different ads in the yearlong drive
will highlight Honda's commitment to America rather than tout
particular products, explains Eric Conn, senior manager for
automobile advertising at American Honda Motor Co.
   Honda officials hope to convince opinion makers that "we
are not a foreign power draining {America} dry," Mr. Conn
continues. "So many people think that we stick {profits} in
big boxes and mail them back to Japan." He says the ads also
are geared at getting consumers who prefer buying American to
consider Honda cars because "this company is more American
than they thought."
   The Japanese car maker's first full-page ad displays a
Honda Sports Coupe, manufactured at its Marysville, Ohio,
plant and equipped with a right-hand steering wheel, which
cars in Japan use. The model "is made only in America," the
advertisement boasts. "But that's not the only place it's
sold. Thousands of Honda Sports Coupes are exported to Japan
every year." Honda began exporting the cars last year.
   Some U.S. executives of Japanese companies are reluctant
to admit they're taking a defensive tack with their new
advertising. Informed Americans "already know we have made
incredible investments in the U.S.," argues Jeffrey Brooks,
senior vice president of advertising at Sony Corp. of
America. Sony, which owns CBS Records and last year purchased
Columbia Pictures Entertainment, will start running its U.S.
corporate-image advertising in late October, mainly in
magazines and on television.
   Any resulting deflection of Americans' anti-Japanese
feelings "would be a side effect," Mr. Brooks says. "That's
not the main direction." The real goal, he insists, is to
bolster Sony's brand image across a range of entertainment
products.
   Similarly, Toyota executives say its maiden U.S. image
campaign, launched in May after three years of planning, just
happened to coincide with a flurry of ads attacking Japan and
Japanese products. "It's not a direct response" to such Japan
bashing, says Timothy Andree, a Toyota public-relations
manager in New York. "Toyota in America is an American
company. I'm not worried about carrying the banner for
Japan."
   But the campaign, costing almost $10 million this year,
deliberately pitches a wholesome image of Toyota as an
American-style practitioner of corporate good citizenship.
The ads describe community programs supported by Toyota.
   Advertising critics aren't sure the new corporate
campaigns will do much good, either at selling products or
overcoming Americans' anxieties about Japan. The ads tend to
lack a sharp focus, these critics say, because Japanese
corporations know a lot more about promoting products than
about pushing themselves.
   "You constantly have to build your image" in the U.S.,
says Hironobu Shibuya, president of public-relations firm
Dentsu-Burston-Marsteller, a U.S.-Japanese joint venture.
"That bugs the hell out of the Japanese because it's
something they never had to do back in Japan. It's a very
American idea."
   The other danger, he warns, is that the Japanese image ads
will boomerang and exacerbate anti-Japanese fervor. "Trying
to buy that {all-American} image by running expensive ads,"
Mr. Shibuya suggests, "can rub off in the wrong way."

   Kodak Picks WPP Unit
                                                                                                       

   Eastman Kodak named WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson unit to
handle the ad launch of its new electronic photography
system, which the company unveiled Monday.
   The system, which will transfer 35mm photographs onto
compact disks for viewing on TV, won't be available until
mid-1992. Kodak wouldn't say whether or not it held a
competition for the ad assignment.
   Kodak also wouldn't disclose the ad budget for the system,
except to say spending would be "commensurate with
expenditures for our most significant consumer products." At
that rate, spending for the system, called "Photo CD," could
approach $30 million.

Advertising. Network spending, reflecting an increase in
corporate ad campaigns, rose 21% to $865 million. Spot ad
expenditures, though, slipped 5% to $640 million, as slow car
and truck sales hurt individual dealers' budgets.

   Hearings on Supreme Court Nominee
   Souter Near End With Little Opposition

   WASHINGTON -- Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court
nominee David Souter neared completion, with witnesses
testifying for and against, but the opposition from liberal
groups was less than expected.
   Most of the opposition at the Senate Judiciary Committee
hearings came from abortion-rights groups and women's rights
groups, who described the 51-year-old Judge Souter as
insensitive to the right to privacy. Molly Yard, president of
the National Organization for Women, declared a "state of
emergency" for women's rights.

<TEXT>
   Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, said: "All the evidence points to the fact
that he will vote to overrule Roe vs. Wade," referring to the
1973 decision that recognized the right to abortion. "He said
nothing to allay our fears," she added.
   But Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.), describing himself as
favoring the right to abortion, said the opposition by
abortion-rights groups was misplaced. "There are going to be
other Supreme Court choices when you're really going to need
to be in the trenches, and this is not one of them."
   A number of civil rights and civil liberties organizations
decided not to oppose Judge Souter's nomination, including
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Alliance
for Justice. The influential Leadership Conference On Civil
Rights, which includes a broad range of groups and that led
the fight in 1987 to defeat Judge Robert Bork's nomination,
couldn't agree on a position for or against the nominee. The
group urged senators to question Judge Souter further on his
attitude toward racial discrimination. The committee is
unlikely to call Judge Souter back for further questioning.
   Balancing the opposition were a number of witnesses,
including former Democratic Attorney General Griffin Bell,
who endorsed the nomination. Mr. Bell said that Mr. Souter, a
former New Hampshire Supreme Court justice who is now a
federal appeals court judge, has the "right vision for our
country and for the law."
   The hearings are due to conclude today with a handful of
additional witnesses. The date hasn't been set for a vote by
the 14member committee, but Senate aides say unofficially
that it may be on Sept. 27. The confirmation is generally
viewed as a certainty.
   Judge Souter, who completed his testimony Monday night,
remained in Washington yesterday, although not at the
hearings. He met briefly in the morning with some witnesses
who were to testify on his behalf, answered correspondence
for much of the day, and went to see the Boston Red Sox play
the Baltimore Orioles in Baltimore last night, aides said.
Next week, the avid outdoorsman is planning to return to New
Hampshire and go hiking while he awaits the Senate's action.
   As the hearings continued yesterday, a dominant factor
continued to be what Democrats and Republicans alike
described as the impressive performance by Judge Souter.
During 18 hours of testimony over three days, he discussed in
detail dozens of Supreme Court precedents, legal principles
and details of court history, never consulting a single note,
or even requesting a break in the lengthy proceedings.
   Late Monday night, as Judge Souter was concluding his
testimony, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, said to the nominee: "It was a tour de
force on your part."

   ANADARKO PETROLEUM (Houston) -- said it will redeem on
Oct. 18, the entire $100 million principal amount outstanding
of its 5 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures, due 2012.
Under the exchange offer, holders will receive $1,042.97,
which includes an early call premium and accrued interest,
for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures held. Or, the
company said, holders may opt to convert the debentures into
Anadarko common at a conversion price of $32.625 a share.
Anadarko, an oil and gas exploration and production concern,
said a conversion into common of the debentures would reduce
debt by about $100 million, from a level of about $474
million at June 30, and increase the number of shares
outstanding by 5.8% or roughly 3.1 million shares. Anadarko
has about 52.4 million shares currently outstanding.

   NutraSweet Allies
   With Mrs. Fields
   For Diet Food Line

   NutraSweet Co., seeking more ways to extend its sweetener
and diet food lines, said it will supply its Desserve foods
to Mrs. Fields Inc. in test markets.
   The agreement is NutraSweet's first effort to market
Desserve products -- mostly desserts, some of them making use
of aspartame sweetener -- through an alliance with another
widely known brand name. And it accelerates a new direction
for NutraSweet in marketing aspartame.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I think what they're saying is that they've gone through
all the categories" in which aspartame was used as an
ingredient in packaged goods and beverages, said Frank Blod,
a consultant to the food industry at New England Consulting
Group, Westport, Conn. "This is a play to get into food
service."
   NutraSweet, a Deerfield, Ill.-based unit of Monsanto Co.,
St. Louis, has so far offered Desserve products only through
its own three Desserve cafes in the Chicago area.
   David Wilson, the Desserve project manager, said
NutraSweet will be looking for additional outlets for the
line, including the in-store bakery or other specialty
sections in grocery stores. "That's where you would probably
see it, rather than on the {packaged goods} shelf or in the
freezer case," he said.
   In Mrs. Fields, based in Park City, Utah, NutraSweet has
found an ally whose name became synonymous with
entrepreneurial success since Debra "Debbi" Fields began
selling cookies from a single store that has grown into a 500
plus-unit chain. Mrs. Fields, the company's founder and chief
executive, said the Desserve line will help her diversify
beyond cookies through Mrs. Fields Bakery Cafes. There are 20
such cafes to date.
   NutraSweet expects to supply two Mrs. Fields bakery cafes
in Chicago by year's end, and four others in San Francisco
early next year. The supplier agreement could quickly expand
if it works out in those test markets. In addition, the
companies expect to cooperate in product development.
   Some consultants noted that NutraSweet, whose namesake
ingredient is in some 3,000 products, will have to tread
carefully while marketing its own food products in order to
avoid antagonizing customers. "What they have to do is
wrestle with what this will mean for the ingredient
business," said David Braff, chief executive of consultants
Braff &amp; Co., New York, though he called the NutraSweet-Mrs.
Fields deal "a good symbiotic relationship."
   But Mr. Wilson of NutraSweet said the Desserve line will
largely be marketed through different distribution channels
and points of sale.
   In baked goods, the line could also move into a category
that products containing NutraSweet haven't filled, since the
ingredient as currently formulated breaks down under heat.
The company is seeking federal approval for a new formulation
that, it says, holds up well under heat.

   Bigger Biotech Firms Outshine Others;
   Nasdaq Index Off 1.90; VeriFone Plunges

   NEW YORK -- As over-the-counter stocks generally go
nowhere, investors are beginning to separate the strong from
the weak in the young biotechnology industry.
   Biotech stocks were little changed yesterday as the Nasdaq
Composite Index eased 1.90 to 372.21, a 0.5% decline, while
volume grew to 115.1 million shares from 94 million Monday.
But as biotech has emerged as one of the hotter stock groups
this year, investors have flocked to the bigger companies and
generally shunned the gleam-in-the-eye enterprises without
products for sale.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the biggest 10 biotech
companies in a group of 20 have eased only 3.5%, far less
than the 14% decline for the smaller half of the group
tracked by Denise Gilbert, a San Francisco biotechnology
analyst for County NatWest Securities. Meanwhile, the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 11%.
   For the year to date, the top half of the 20 biotech
stocks followed by Ms. Gilbert rose 34%. That compares with a
flat performance by the smallest 10 stocks.
   Biotech industry executives now expect sales to reach $75
billion by the end of the decade, rather than $100 billion,
as forecast a year ago.
   "Financing expectations are half of what they were a year
ago," said G. Steven Burrill of Ernst &amp; Young in San
Francisco, at a news session yesterday describing the
accounting firm's fifth annual survey of biotech executives.
The survey was completed before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
rattled the financial markets and before federal regulators
unexpectedly delayed recommending approval of two products
developed by Immunex and Cetus. Both events shut the
near-term window for public financing of biotech stocks, he
said.
   Only larger companies with the best prospects of having
their products approved are finding financiers on Wall
Street. Those companies also are having the most success in
striking strategic alliances with other biotech and
pharmaceutical companies, according to the survey. As the
industry increasingly stratifies, "you're seeing the large
companies pull away from the pack and become the dominant
part of the industry," Mr. Burrill said.
   "The lower tier is in `biotech purgatory,'" says Ms.
Gilbert. "They'll either move up or move out." On the other
hand, the upper crust will move up as their products move
closer to market.
   Ms. Gilbert's top-tier list includes Amgen, Cetus,
Centocor, Chiron and Biogen as well as Genzyme, Genetics
Institute, Immunex, Xoma and exchange-listed Genentech. She
says there is an "upper crust" among second-tier companies
that stand the best chance of obtaining financing, including
Cytogen, Synergen, Repligen and California Biotechnology.
Other companies in her second tier are Immunomedics, NeoRx,
Oncogene Science, T Cell Sciences and Genex.
   Ms. Gilbert says she has "buy" recommendations only on
those companies that already have reported profits -- Amgen,
Genentech and Genzyme.
   VeriFone, the day's most active stock, lost nearly half
its value in a 5 1/4-point dive to an all-time low of 7 5/8,
less than half its initial offering price of $16 a share in
March. Monday, VeriFone said third-quarter results are likely
to fall below analysts' expectations. Recent estimates have
been between 25 cents and 27 cents a share for the Redwood
City, Calif., provider of credit-card handling technology,
according to Zacks Investment Research Inc. Morgan Stanley
analyst L. Keith Mullins slashed his estimate for VeriFone's
third-quarter earnings to 13 cents from 25 cents and
downgraded his investment opinion to "hold" from "buy."
   After the close, VeriFone said it agreed to provide credit
card authorization to PBS National Datacast Inc., a unit of
Public Broadcasting Service. Nearly 4.5 million VeriFone
shares changed hands yesterday, 37 times average volume. The
stock traded as high as 26 earlier this year.
   Oracle Systems rose 1/4 to 7 1/8 in heavy trading after
the software maker confirmed reports of layoffs and top-level
management changes in the wake of its first quarterly loss
ever.
   News from the technology sector aided several stocks.
   Sun Microsystems' computers will be used in a "Photo CD"
unveiled yesterday by Eastman Kodak Co. The system puts
snapshots on compact discs for television viewing. Sun rose
7/8 to 29 3/8.
   Apple Computer decided to remain neutral in the rivalry
over the Unix operating sytem, which was originally developed
by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. Apple said it will join
two rival groups that have been debating how to turn the Unix
software into a computer-industry standard, rather than take
sides. Sun is a partner with AT&amp;T in Unix International.
Apple eased 3/8 to 33 3/8.
   3Com gained 1/4 to 7 1/8 after the Santa Clara, Calif.,
maker of computer communications systems said it began
shipping Microsoft's LAN (local-area network) Manager 2.0
system with its own network software. Microsoft rose 1 to 61
1/2.
   Trading also was heavy in Ashton-Tate, which rose 1/8 to 7
7/8 on 2.4 million shares, and Chips &amp; Technologies, which
eased 1/4 to 11 on more than one million shares.
   MCI Communications was unchanged at 32 1/8 after the
Washington, D.C., long-distance carrier said it agreed to buy
Over Seas Telecommunications Inc., an Alexandria, Va.,
provider of satellite digital communications overseas. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   Anemic earnings outlooks felled several stocks. Stokely
USA tumbled 3 1/8 to 13. The Oconomowoc, Wis., company said
it expects a 5% to 10% drop in sales will result in a 50%
decline in earnings for the second quarter, ending Sept. 30,
compared with year-earlier earnings.
   Analysts International skidded 1 7/8 to 12 3/8 after the
Minneapolis computer programming concern said its 1991 growth
rate will fall short of its 20% target. The company also said
it expects earnings in the first quarter, ending Sept. 30,
will be flat, although revenue and earnings for the full year
should set a record.

   There has been a justified concern over the prospect that
Iraq might employ its chemical weapons against the forces of
the U.S. and its allies. No one questions that Iraq has a
large supply of various chemical agents that it can deliver
by a number of means. Possibly its most potent weapon is the
Soviet Scud B missile, which is capable of delivering such
agents to a distance of 400 miles. When pressed during the
war with Iran, Iraq employed these weapons to produce as many
as 5,000 casualties a day. It has also used them against its
own citizens, the Kurds. With these facts in mind, the issue
that arises in the current altercation is how to discourage
this use.
   There are a number of options to be considered: As a
defensive measure, military personnel could be sealed in a
protective garment. Against some agents it is doubtful that
this measure would be effective. In any case the garments
would impair troop performance. It is not surprising that
such a solution was not well received by NATO when it was
faced with an impressive Soviet chemical- and
biological-weapons threat. Further, daytime temperatures in
the Middle East deserts can exceed 120 degrees, creating an
unacceptable environment for the use of such clothing. For
these reasons this option should be rejected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The second option would involve a U.S. deployment of a
chemical-weapons stockpile of sufficient capability. For this
solution the U.S. has little stomach. In fact, the current
aim of the U.S. administration is to eliminate stockpiles of
chemical weapons throughout the world.
   The purpose of the third option would be to discourage the
Iraqi employment of any force, including the use of chemical
weapons, by the threat of the use of nuclear weapons. Were
the Iraqis not so dissuaded, the use of nuclear weapons
against Iraqi ground forces would best serve to defeat such
an attack. An enhanced radiation weapon is proposed. It would
be distinctly different from other strategic nuclear weapons.
Their yields would be much lower. Their predominant effect
would be to destroy living organisms while producing minimum
physical destruction. In this regard they would resemble the
effects produced by chemical agents. However, unlike these
agents, their employment would not be influenced by the
weather. Finally, the weapons function so that within a given
circle all living, exposed matter is destroyed; beyond this
circle the lethal effect diminishes rapidly.
   As an immediate option, the nominal five-kiloton
enhanced-radiation warhead produced for the NATO Lance
missile could be employed. (These warheads were never
deployed in Europe.) If airburst over a battlefield, the area
promptly lethal to personnel in a tank would be about one
square mile. Beyond an area of five square miles there would
be no effect on exposed troops. With some effort such a
weapon could be readied almost immediately for either missile
or aircraft delivery. For such a weapon to be effective it
would need both to be advertised widely as a distinctive
chemical-warfare deterrent and to be endorsed strongly by the
president.
   Those who find such a suggestion repulsive might well
change their opinions were an Iraqi chemical attack to result
in the death of thousands of U.S. troops.

   "Paradise Dream" is the torrid tale of Ivan and Anne
Marie, who fall in love while searching for an archaeologist
lost in a Hawaiian jungle. Their passion blossoms as they
overcome obstacles large and small, including a lost
corkscrew on page 102 that threatens to ruin their beach
picnic until Ivan, charmingly, pushes the cork into the wine
bottle with his car keys.
   At least that's in the "Paradise Dream" written for Ivan
and Anne Marie Avetissian of Moorpark, Calif. Mr. Avetissian
ordered the $150 deluxe edition of the novel to celebrate the
couple's fifth wedding anniversary. The corkscrew scene came
from the personal-romance questionnaire he faxed to the
author, Evelyn Brown.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Brown has founded a publishing enterprise on the
observation that all happy couples are alike -- almost. Using
a computer program to fill in the blanks, Ms. Brown can crank
out a 100-page hard-cover novel in an hour. At last count,
she had rewritten "Paradise Dream" 1,500 times.
   Ms. Brown will cast a couple's names in the leading roles
for $45. For another $15 she'll throw in their hobbies, best
friends, favorite flowers, first kiss, pets, special songs,
and other details. In one version, a guest sits on a glass
table during the wedding reception: "The bride, groom and
their guests spent the rest of the day pulling glass shards
from Jo's derriere."
   Ms. Brown created Swan Publishing in 1987 out of a pair of
hobbies: computers and steamy novels. She enrolled in a
"Writing Romances" course and six months later completed "Our
Love," a tale about a newspaper reporter and an
allegedly-but-not-really-corrupt developer. Realizing that
the romance-fiction market was impossibly crowded, she
decided to cut out the middlemen -- agent, publisher and
supermarket -- and sell customized books directly by mail.
   From her garage in Placentia, Calif., Ms. Brown publishes
"Our Love," "Paradise Dream" and her latest, "Lotto Love," in
which a couple wins the lottery but then loses the winning
ticket. Customers can choose the sensuality level of their
text -- from the Candlelit Edition ("like the network
version") to the Burning Embers Edition ("the cable
version").
   Pleased customers have come back for second and third
orders, with a different paramour each time. "I had a guy
tell me all about his girlfriend, and (how) he loved her and
so on," Ms. Brown says. He later requested another novel --
for his wife.

   Soybean Contract Prices Rebound Amid Worries
   About Chances of a Midwest Frost by Next Week

   CHICAGO -- Prices of soybean contracts rebounded amid
jitters about the chances of a Midwest frost by next week.
   The soybean and corn crops are vulnerable to frost damage
because the unusually wet summer slowed their rate of
maturity.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Soybean prices reacted the most strongly of major Midwest
crops yesterday in part because a weekly government survey of
growing conditions showed that the soybean crop didn't
improve as expected in Minnesota, Nebraska and Missouri.
   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the soybean
contract for September delivery rose seven cents a bushel to
settle at $6.225 a bushel.
   On Monday, soybean prices had dropped in the wake of signs
that the White House won't offer any special trade credits
soon to the Soviet Union, one of the biggest buyers of U.S.
crops.
   U.S. traders had been speculating that reports of bread
shortages in the Soviet Union might help unlock U.S. credits.
But the Bush administration wants the Soviet Union to first
clear away any hurdles that block emigration by its Jewish
citizens.
   The new frost forecast also helped to slightly raise
prices of several corn futures contracts.
   In a typical year, most crops have stopped developing on
their own accord in time for a killing frost. This year,
however, only 33% of the corn crop is mature, compared with a
normal rate of 61%, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.
   Only 22% of the soybean crop has matured, compared with a
normal rate of 39% by this time of the season, Mr. Lespinasse
said.
   The rally was triggered by forecasts for cool and wet
weather in much of the Midwest through this weekend. Such a
weather pattern would continue to slow the harvest while
increasing the chances of a frost.
   Some forecasters are predicting a chance for a frost by
Monday in northern sections of southern Minnesota, Iowa,
Illinois and Indiana.
   Most analysts expect soybean prices to be choppy until the
harvest is completed. After the harvest, traders will begin
to focus on the prospects for the planting of soybeans in
South America.
   According to Robert Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain &amp;
Livestock Corp., Chicago, soybean acreage may slip in South
America because budget pressures are forcing governments to
trim funds to farmers. At the same time, farm expenses are
increasing in the wake of the jump in oil prices, he said.
   Wheat prices fell yesterday.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: With no additional war talk out of the Middle East
or Washington, crude oil futures prices couldn't sustain
Monday's record-breaking gains, falling 22 cents a barrel in
New York Mercantile Exchange trading. Crude for October
delivery fell to $33.41 a barrel on the heels of similar
declines in Europe. The October contract, which expires with
tomorrow's trading, was the only crude contract showing a
decline on the New York Merc. However, October and November
gasoline registered a slight decline, as well. Traders have
expressed some surprise at the recent relative sluggishness
in gasoline futures prices.
   Perhaps some of that surprise will dissipate when traders
digest the latest weekly report on U.S. petroleum inventories
released by the American Petroleum Institute after trading
stopped yesterday. It showed a huge 5,870,000 barrel buildup
in gasoline stocks for the week ended Friday. Traders and
analysts surveyed earlier by AP-Dow Jones said they thought
gasoline inventories fell by 750,000 barrels that week.
   Similarly, survey participants were substantially off in
their crude inventory estimates. The API report put U.S.
crude stocks at nearly 369.8 million barrels, a decrease of
4.5 million barrels. The AP-Dow Jones report said market
players expected a drop of 2.1 million barrels.
   Only on heating oil was the survey's projection of a
1,750,000-barrel increase about on target with the API's 1.6
million barrel rise. Heating oil futures have exhibited
strength in recent sessions that traders attribute to spread
trading and firmer European prices. Yesterday, October
heating oil ended at 86.43 cents a gallon, up 1.12 cents.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were sharply lower despite a
partial recovery from an early plunge that was triggered by
weakness in London. The December contract ended with a loss
of 3.75 cents a pound at $1.24, just under the day's high of
$1.2450. The December contract dropped six cents a pound in
early trading to $1.2170, as traders reacted in sympathy with
London, said John Gross, president of J.E. Gross &amp;
Associates, copper industry consultants in New City, N.Y.
"There has been growing concern in London that there might
not be enough copper to satisfy deliveries against the cash
contract on the London Metal Exchange by Thursday, which is
the day on which the contract matures," Mr. Gross said. As a
result, he said, traders who had previously sold short in
anticipation that prices would go down began buying back
contracts to liquidate their positions. As a result, he
noted, "the spread, or the difference between the cash
position and three months {delivery} on Monday widened to the
equivalent of 20 cents a pound." Yesterday, the urgency to
buy contracts by traders who previously sold short ran its
course and the spread between the cash and three months
deliveries narrowed to nine cents a pound as the price of the
cash contract fell sharply, according to Mr. Gross.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices declined. The October contract ended
with a loss of 0.23 cent a pound at 10.92 cents, after
rebounding from a drop to 10.75 cents, which was the day's
low and 0.40 cent below Monday's close. Traders in recent
sessions have been liquidating October contracts prior to the
expiration of the contract on Sept. 28, an analyst said.
Yesterday, after trading quietly most of the day, selling
developed in the contract; the price decline was accelerated
by the thin market, the analyst said. Additional selling
appeared as the December price fell below 11 cents, 10.90
cents and 10.80 cents, regarded as chief resistance levels,
until it fell to its low and steadied. Traders ignored a
report by the International Sugar Organization that estimated
there would be a surplus of 559,000 metric tons of sugar at
the end of the current season on Aug. 31, 1991. Because that
projection was well below the forecast of a major London
trade firm, which last week estimated the surplus at 1.4
million tons, it normally would have been a price-firming
factor, a New York dealer said. "People apparently aren't
paying attention to fundamentals at this moment," the dealer
said.

   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration asked
manufacturers of toothpastes and mouthwashes to submit
scientific data to justify the anti-plaque claims on their
product labels.
   The FDA didn't accuse the manufacturers of misleading
consumers. But it said much research has been done in the
area of oral health care since anti-plaque toothpastes and
mouthwashes were first reviewed by the agency as
non-prescription drugs. In recent years, the products have
been heavily promoted as preventing, among other things, the
buildup of dental plaque and gum disease.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the data don't support the various claims, the FDA said
it would require the manufacturers to drop them. Anti-plaque
toothpastes are touted as containing abrasives that provide
mechanical action to remove plaque. Mouthwash manufacturers
claim their products work differently, through anti-microbial
or chemical activity.
   Under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the safety
and effectiveness of such product ingredients must be
demonstrated, an FDA spokeswoman said.

   Cherished Soviet Strategies Fall by the Wayside
   As 5 Years of Perestroika Fail to Heal Economy

   MOSCOW -- In the late 1960s, Stanislav Shatalin worked on
an economic theory known as "optimal planning" that was
supposed to make the Soviet system of central planning
foolproof. Today, he is the main author of proposals to undo
central planning and create a market economy in the Soviet
Union in just 500 days.
   Abel Aganbegyan, who has helped Mr. Shatalin fine-tune his
market proposals, told parliament this week that the Soviet
economy is in a "catastrophic situation" and can recover only
if the Shatalin plan is quickly implemented. But less than
two years ago, Mr. Aganbegyan was advocating a streamlined
system of central planning, including more state investment
in heavy industry, to dig the economy out of its hole. Such
policies are now widely blamed for the economy's dire state.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev's botched attempt to
overhaul the Soviet economy, has done strange things to the
beliefs and reputations of the nation's leading economists.
Cherished theories have been turned on their heads, and
once-committed Marxists are starting to sound a bit like
Milton Friedman.
   Rather than defending the old system or trying to improve
it, as they once used to, many Soviet economists now agree
that it has to be jettisoned entirely to avoid collapse. The
only way forward, they argue, is to emulate Western theories
and practices they once denounced, such as stock markets and
private property. If this leads to inflation and unemployment
-- long blasted by Soviet propagandists as the twin evils of
capitalism -- then so be it.
   In most places, such astonishing shifts of thinking might
raise questions about the integrity of the people concerned.
But in the Soviet Union, these turnabouts are viewed as proof
of a willingness to abandon dogma and learn from mistakes.
   The very failure of Mr. Gorbachev's reforms to date has
been the catalyst. Like several Soviet leaders before him, he
sought to make the Stalinist economic structure more
efficient when he took office in 1985. But his attempts to
loosen up central planning unbalanced the economy, causing
shortages of basic goods such as bread and shoes,
exacerbating the budget deficit and triggering inflation.
   "Five years of perestroika were necessary for people to
change," says Grigory Yavlinsky, a 38-year-old radical
economist and deputy premier of the Russian republic. "A lot
of mistakes were made in our economic policy, which is why
there are such poor results now." But without these errors,
he says, "the psychology of {economists} would have been
totally unprepared" for the market reforms the nation is on
the verge of adopting.
   As a member of a new generation of up-and-coming
economists, Mr. Yavlinsky hasn't been through the same
conceptual contortions as many of his older colleagues. But
not all of them have totally reversed their views, either.
Some still stick to hard-line communism; others were always
more reform-minded. Nikolai Petrakov, Mr. Gorbachev's
economic adviser, quietly advocated the need for market
mechanisms long before they were fashionable. He was even
slammed as a "market socialist" by Pravda, the Communist
Party daily, in the 1970s.
   But Mr. Petrakov was an exception. Most economists kept
disagreements with official policy to themselves, or within
the walls of their institutes. Now that Mr. Gorbachev's
policy of glasnost, or openness, has allowed them to talk
freely, they spend a lot of time feuding with each other. One
acrimonious battle is complicating plans to introduce the new
market-based reforms on Oct. 1. On the one side is Mr.
Shatalin and a group of younger economists such as Mr.
Yavlinsky, who favor swift decentralization and deregulation
of the economy and the introduction of market prices for most
goods.
   On the other side is Leonid Abalkin, a deputy prime
minister whose deep voice and dry manner exude an air of
gloom. Described by friends as a Marxist, Mr. Abalkin was
primarily responsible for drafting the government's more
cautious program of transition to a market economy. He favors
a continued big role for central bureaucrats, and wants to
maintain government-fixed prices for most goods, at least in
the short term.
   For two years, he has been the economist most closely
identified with government policy. Western bankers who know
him say he recognizes the flaws in the Soviet system. But he
continues to air doubts about the introduction of private
property and advocates hefty social programs to cushion the
blow of a more liberal economic system. He now says a market
system is needed, yet he co-authored a textbook published
this year filled with traditional swipes at capitalism. "The
main aim of capitalism is to squeeze out surplus value" from
the workers, the book lectures, in true Marxist style.
   But Mr. Abalkin suffered a severe blow along with his
mentor, Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, when President
Gorbachev last week said he preferred the Shatalin plan. The
deputy premier immediately went on the offensive, warning
that Mr. Shatalin's proposals amounted to little more than
"fairy tales" and would lead to a sharp drop in living
standards.
   Mr. Shatalin, a mercurial 56-year-old who is dogged by
ill-health and looks 10 years older than his age, soon struck
back. He told parliament that "we need different
authorities," a hint that Mr. Abalkin should resign. After
Mr. Gorbachev ordered that the two sets of proposals be
combined, Mr. Shatalin immediately said the unified version
"is 99% mine."
   In fact, officials say he worked with Mr. Petrakov on the
proposal. The two men first met while attending Moscow
University in the 1950s and then become theoretical
economists at a Moscow institute. This theoretical background
may explain why Mr. Shatalin is more able than Mr. Abalkin to
leap political hurdles.
   "Shatalin is more uncompromising than Abalkin," says
Albert Yeremin, a conservative economist who knows both. "He
doesn't like ideological terms such as a socialist or planned
market."
   The Shatalin-Abalkin dispute has marked the re-emergence
of Mr. Aganbegyan, a portly 57-year-old Armenian. He rose to
prominence soon after Mr. Gorbachev took office in 1985,
devising a blueprint for the first stage of perestroika. But
his belief in accelerating economic growth and spending huge
sums to modernize industry without undertaking more
fundamental changes to the system are now blamed for many of
perestroika's woes.
   "He has a technocratic approach to reform," says Tatyana
Koryagina, a radical economist who has known Mr. Aganbegyan
since the 1960s, when both worked in Siberia. She says he was
completely caught out when perestroika started to go wrong,
despite or because of his policies.
   After disappearing for a couple of years, traveling the
world as an unofficial Soviet economic envoy, Mr. Aganbegyan
resurfaced last month when Mr. Gorbachev asked him to draft a
compromise reform plan incorporating both the Shatalin and
Abalkin proposals.
   "It proved impossible to unite the two," Mr. Aganbegyan
conceded to parliament this week. Then, endorsing Mr.
Shatalin's variant, he warned that the economy "is much worse
than it appears." Compared with what could lie ahead unless a
market system comes soon, he said, the present shortages are
just "a joke."

   Yesterday Charles Keating Jr. was booked in Los Angeles on
criminal-fraud charges involving his failed Lincoln Savings
and Loan. On Monday, regulators at the Resolution Trust Corp.
filed papers showing that they plan to declare insolvency of
another thrift, Franklin Savings Association, ignoring a
federal court order to return it to its owners. Our
regulators, it seems, can't tell foxes from chickens, let
alone sheep from goats.
   To be sure, regulators suffered a decade of intimidation
by the likes of Jim Wright or the five Senators upon whom Mr.
Keating conferred notoriety. This climate allowed the Charley
Keatings and Donald Dixons to run rampant through the S&amp;Ls.
Yet now free of interference, the regulators are creating a
climate of bloody-mindedness, jeopardizing otherwise safe
S&amp;Ls, exposing the government to potentially explosive legal
liabilities, running up the cost of the S&amp;L fiasco and doing
more than anything else to slow the economy to the brink of
recession.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Anyone who doubts that regulators have run berserk should
read the extracts alongside from the opinion in the Franklin
case by Federal District Judge Dale Saffels, himself former
head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of Topeka. And
especially to contrast it with the opinion in the Lincoln
case by Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin, former
enforcement head at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In dispatching Mr. Keating's brazen suit to reclaim Lincoln,
Judge Sporkin has no trouble citing chapter and verse of
deception and what he calls "skullduggery."
   The regulators are unable to distinguish this from the
Franklin case, in which Judge Saffels finds a good-faith
management, indeed one that bailed out a sick S&amp;L by
developing a sophisticated strategy of financial hedges. The
judge finds that Franklin has not been endangered by its
management; its hedges "have not caused any economic losses
to the institution." Rather, it's been endangered by
regulators pursuing an abstruse argument over hedge
accounting, debating over the extent to which losses on hedge
instruments can be amortized against unrealized gains on
other instruments against which they were hedged.
   The intensity of this pursuit is frightening. The
regulators had previously blown the Silverado and Centrust
cases, and weren't about to let another one get away. The
examiner pounced on Franklin's 10K, having only read one such
document in his life. The regulators' general counsel set out
a strategy of "pointing a finger" at the thrift's management,
and then gave instructions not to follow up management's
report that its bond trustee would not regard certain filings
as grounds to exercise claims to collateral. Elsewhere in the
opinion, the judge repeatedly complains that documents
favorable to Franklin were missing from the record.
   On our reading of the record, Judge Saffels was generous
in his finding that regulators had not acted in bad faith.
Yet they obtained a stay of his ruling from a higher court
and reseized Franklin. Now, without waiting for a full
hearing of their appeal, they've moving for insolvency.
   The Franklin case, moreover, is hardly the only case of
regulatory excess. In Oregon, Judge Owen Panner last week
issued a final judgment in favor of the owners of Far West
Federal. He said that the government's plan to renege on its
1987 agreement with the owners would violate their right
against takings. Dozens of similar cases are in various
courtrooms across the nation.
   This goes far to explain why the cost of the thrift
problem keeps rising. Regulators have themselves decimated
Franklin, and probably other institutions as well. Because
the government has insured the depositors, taxpayers will
have to foot the cost of this further damage. Indeed,
ultimately they may have to foot it twice. If the bureaucrats
again lose in court, taxpayers will be stuck with a
multimillion-dollar claim for compensation from owners and
bondholders.
   Naturally, too, frightening cases like Franklin frighten
the rest of the industry. Why should even the best manager
buy into a possibly salvageable thrift if he has to subject
himself to such regulators? How can present thrift
managements move at all?
   The same regulatory climate is spreading throughout the
economy. In particular, jitters have spread to the commercial
banks, whose regulators have decided to avoid an S&amp;L problem
at whatever cost. With everyone afraid of taking a bad risk,
no one takes any risk, fewer and fewer loans are made, the
economy crawls more and more slowly. Balance sheets get
sorrier and sorrier, and regulators see more and more
evidence for more and more stringency.
   Yes, there surely has been fraud and excess to correct,
but if financial safety is the purpose there is also a need
for prudence and discrimination. Yet rather than reform the
underlying flaw of deposit insurance, we are sending
examiners who are supposed to second-guess the good loans and
the bad. Bankers are bad enough at this; who ever believed
bureaucrats would be better?

   Two separate instances in recent days prove what we have
always known. Our sentinels of progress and social welfare
never sleep. Now, in their endless struggle on behalf of the
needy, they have taken on both Mother Teresa and the
Salvation Army.
   The conflict involving Mother Teresa began when her order,
the Missionaries of Charity, undertook to renovate two old
buildings in New York City into residences for the homeless.
Bearing all the costs of the extensive renovation themselves,
the nuns planned to provide food, clothing, shelter and job
referrals for more than 60 homeless men.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trouble began when New York City officials demanded
that the nuns install an elevator for disabled tenants, as
per the requirement that such housing include facilities for
the handicapped. The nuns, unprepared for the additional
expenditure of something close to an additional $100,000,
assured the city that they stood ready to carry any
handicapped resident who could not climb stairs. They asked
for a waiver of the elevator requirement, which the city's
Buildings Department was prepared to grant. Until, that is,
Mayor David Dinkins's Office for People With Disabilities
weighed in.
   As Director Anne M. Emerman saw it, approving the waiver
didn't just have to do with elevators; it had to do with the
endorsement of wrong values. Explaining why the nuns carrying
people upstairs would not do for New York City (also
occasionally known as Calcutta on the Hudson), Ms. Emerman
noted, "Their attitude in India is, they go out and carry
people in off the street. . . . We said no, you don't carry
people up and down in our society. That's not acceptable
here."
   Thanks to this intercession, Mother Teresa's nuns have
scuttled their project to house the homeless of New York
City. In place of housing for the homeless, the city instead
got the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities providing
a ringing reaffirmation of our prevailing societal and
cultural standards. That should help keep the homeless warm
this winter.
   Meanwhile, the Bush administration's Labor Department has
gone to war with the Salvation Army, which has for more than
a hundred years fed, sheltered and counseled the poor. Those
who receive their services of food, board and roughly $20 a
week are required, in exchange, to perform a modicum of work
for the Army, such as gathering old clothes, unloading trucks
or assisting in the kitchen.
   The Labor Department has decided that the Salvation Army
is an employer guilty of exploiting workers under the terms
of the Fair Labor Standards Act and is demanding that the
Army's beneficiaries be paid the minimum wage. The Salvation
Army argues, unanswerably, that the destitute to whom they
assign work, and whom they feed and try to teach discipline,
cannot be considered employees in the usual sense of the
word. The Labor Department's efforts to force them to pay a
wage would, moreover, force their service centers out of
business by bankrupting them. Until now, the Salvation Army
has been providing 11,000 beds at 117 centers around the
country.
   We will continue to monitor the efforts of the public
welfare bureaucracy to extinguish the 1,000 points of light
one by one.

   We have come across a nice little case study in the
difference between the way the public sector and private
sector might approach a similar problem. The postmaster in
Kansas City last month recommended that local patrons forgo
red and green envelopes with their Christmas cards this year.
He says the automatic-sorting machines that "read" addresses
can't handle color. But the Postal Service offered to print
address labels for free, because it turns out the machines
can't read poor handwriting, either. You can't blame the U.S.
Mail for trying to speed things up but you have to think that
a private operator would find ways to exploit the festive
spirit rather than dampen it. The card makers are happy

   FAIRFIELD, N.J. -- Prime Motor Inns Inc., only a year
after becoming the second-largest hotel concern in the U.S.,
said it filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   In a statement, Prime Motor added that Servico Inc., a
unit of FCD Hospitality Inc., which owes a large sum to Prime
Motor, filed a Chapter 11 petition in the same U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Miami. No other details were provided
concerning the filing, however, and the company declined to
comment yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prime Motor shares, which stopped trading for several
hours yesterday pending news of the filing, have now lost
practically all of their market value. Yesterday, they
plunged 75 cents to close at 50 cents a share in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. With 33 million
shares outstanding, the indicated value of the company was
$16 million; just last week, Prime Motor stock was trading at
$3.375 a share, giving an indicated value of $111.3 million.
Last year, the stock traded as high as $38 apiece.
   As a result of the filing, Prime Motor Inns L.P., which
indirectly owns 16 Holiday Inn motels leased to a Prime Motor
Inns unit, said it may not be able to pay distributions to
its unit holders. Also, Ramada Assured Income Associates,
which is managed by two Prime Motor Inns' units, said the
filing would result in a smaller payout to its unit holders.
   The filing comes less than a week after Prime threatened
such an action unless it could obtain additional loans and
other financial relief from its bank lenders. Prime Motor
sought to extend the maturity date of existing loans, obtain
a fresh $25 million loan and to restructure terms of sharing
proceeds from asset sales.
   But yesterday, people familiar with the lenders said the
banks were still considering the requests and hadn't come to
a decision when Prime Motor filed for Chapter 11 protection.
   Prime grew rapidly during the past several years, by last
year operating 1,100 properties with more than 150,000 rooms,
making it the second-largest hotel company. But in the
process of expansion, it also incurred heavy bank debt --
about $350 million -- just as financing became tighter and
the hotel market became depressed.
   Prime Motor has since reduced its bank debt, all due next
March 31, to about $110 million, primarily through asset
sales. It also sold the Rodeway Inns franchise to Manor Care
Inc., Silver Spring, Md., for $14.9 million. That left the
company operating 140 properties with about 14,000 rooms but
still straddling about $400 million in long-term debt apart
from the bank debt.
   As of March 31, when Prime Motor last reported its
results, the company had about $1.4 billion in assets and
about $913 million in liabilities.
   Following the latest announcement, Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its subordinated debt rating of
both Prime Motor and Servico to Ca from Caa. The rating
downgrade affects Prime's convertible subordinated debentures
due 2011 and 2013, and Servico subordinated notes due 1997. A
total of about $318 million in debt is affected.
   Also, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it was dropping Prime
Motor from its stock index of 500 companies and adding JWP
Inc., a Purchase, N.Y., technical-services company, effective
today.

   Unsoeld, Her Mountains Climbed and Tragedies
   Past, Is Again Caught Between Man and Nature

   VANCOUVER, Wash. -- Jolene Unsoeld is a slender woman with
steel-cable strength. She confronts life as she would
confront a mountain, as a challenge to be surmounted.
   Fifty-eight years old and a first-term Democratic
congresswoman now, she was already climbing mountains as a
teen-ager. She became the first woman to scale Wyoming's
Grand Teton by a direct ascent of its north face. But in
mountains she found tragedy. She's confronting that, too.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Family photographs, so personal you have the uneasy
feeling you've intruded into a living room, line her campaign
headquarters here. There is her daughter Devi climbing her
namesake mountain, India's Nanda Devi. Devi died on that
mountain, in her father's arms. There is her husband, Willi
-- the legend who climbed Mount Everest by its stark and
stunning West Ridge, the philosopher who searched for meaning
above 10,000 feet. In 1979, three years after Devi's death,
Willi was killed by an avalanche.
   "I've grown so much tougher since then," the congresswoman
says softly. The gray-haired grandmother will need all the
toughness she can muster. For Rep. Unsoeld is climbing a
different kind of mountain now.
   She may well be the most-endangered Democratic incumbent
in the House. Two years ago, surviving the nation's closest
House race, she squeaked into office by only 618 votes. Now
she's a top-priority Republican target. An environmentalist,
she's caught in the cross fire of the Pacific Northwest's
raging timber war, which pits logging jobs against preserving
old-growth forest and the endangered northern spotted owl.
It's a no-win issue.
   "Things are getting better," she wryly tells a rally here,
recounting the day she joined a parade of angry loggers.
"There was only one logger who said, `If I had a gun I'd
shoot you.'"
   Her southwest Washington district, a region of prime
timberland between the Pacific Coast and the high Cascades,
is traditionally Democratic. But the timber issue alienates
normally Democratic voters, and Rep. Unsoeld's GOP opponent,
former state legislator Bob Williams, has a proven knack for
winning Democratic votes. A conservative, Mr. Williams is
attacking her as an environmental "extremist" who "clearly
has never been on the side of the workingman."
   This race is a barometer of the volatile
environment-vs.-logging issue that's roiling politics
throughout Washington, Oregon and California this year. But
what gives the race a dimension beyond politics is the
personal drama of the woman herself.
   She's a self-described "meddler" in government, determined
to remain so. In 1971, she became a self-appointed watchdog,
tracking the influence of special-interest money in state
politics. The title of a study she published stripped the
political process to a stark core: "Who Gave? Who Got? How
Much?" She'd pore over campaign-contribution disclosures
until five in the morning, then find herself too keyed up to
sleep. The effort, she says, "came close to breaking my
health." Elected to the legislature in 1984, she championed
openness in government and tougher regulations for
toxic-waste disposal.
   In her quiet but relentless way, she is as driven as her
late husband. Willi Unsoeld, who climbed Mount Everest in
1963, believed that "life begins at 10,000 feet." He spent
his life searching for spiritual wholeness -- "closeness with
the ice, brotherhood with the rock," he once put it -- in the
wind and swirling snow beneath summit after summit.
   As a young man, Willi Unsoeld was enchanted by the sheer
loveliness of Nanda Devi, India's highest peak. As he told
and retold the story, he decided then and there it was time
to find a wife, father a daughter and name her for the
mountain. He and Jolene announced their engagement to friends
atop Mount St. Helens. They had four children, two boys and
two girls. In 1976, Willi took his daughter Devi to climb her
mountain.
   It all went terribly wrong.
   The expedition had pushed above 23,000 feet when Devi was
stricken with acute abdominal pains. The pains continued
throughout the night. In the early morning, Willi and others
in the group prepared to get her to lower altitude. Almost
matter-of-factly, Devi said: "I'm going to die." She pitched
forward and was gone. Jolene got the telegram: ". . . Body
committed to the mountain." It was like a burial at sea.
   Three years later, death claimed Willi. An
outdoor-education teacher by then, he led a party of college
students on a winter climb of Mount Rainier. A savage storm
caught the group as it descended; an avalanche killed both
Willi and a student with him.
   "They say it takes a year" to recover from tragedy, Rep.
Unsoeld says. "It takes longer than that."
   She dates her own healing to a wave of utter certainty
that swept over her one day while, of all things, she was
doing the vacuuming. "I hate doing the vacuuming]" she says.
"But I was suddenly aware that {the tragedy} was not a total
loss . . . but rather that all the things my husband and I
had done, separately and together, had coalesced. It could go
on with me."
   So now she campaigns for re-election, a woman far more
comfortable with talking public policy than with asking for
the public's votes. Driving down the interstate, talking
legislation, she becomes so animated that both hands fly off
the steering wheel. The car cruises on, as if on automatic
pilot. But later, after asking for help at a rally, she
admits to the crowd: "You don't know how hard that is to say.
Because I am a very independent cuss."
   Too independent, argues Republican opponent Bob Williams,
who calls Rep. Unsoeld far beyond the mainstream of the
district. "If she were representing Hollywood, it wouldn't be
so bad," he says. "Even within her party she's considered
extremely liberal." Republican big guns have flown into the
Northwest to reinforce his campaign -- among them President
Bush, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan.
   Overshadowing all else is the jobs-vs.-environment issue.
No one can say with certainty how many jobs are threatened by
the federal decision to save the spotted owl and the
old-growth forests in which it lives. But fear and anger are
in the air -- a Williams radio spot predicts a loss of as
many as 40,000 jobs -- and even Unsoeld supporters concede
the issue can only hurt her.
   "Loggers are going to be mad at somebody, and I think
they're going to be mad at incumbents," says Joe King, the
Democratic speaker of the Washington House. Yet Mr. King
draws encouragement from a campaign incident last May.
   Picketing loggers blocked the congresswoman's entrance to
an indoor event. So for three hours the petite congresswoman
stayed outside in a chill wind, listening to burly loggers.
After most had drifted away, she climbed inside the truck cab
of some latecomers and listened some more.
   "I think Jolene will win on character," ventures Mr. King.
"Jeez, that woman has guts."

   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. announced
plans to add features to its Unix operating system that will
increase its security and let it work on computers using more
than one central processor.
   The data-protection features will be available in the
first half of next year. Some multiprocessing capabilities
will be provided in the first half; more advanced features
will become available in 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These capabilities had already been promised, as a group
led by AT&amp;T vied for control of the Unix standard with the
Open Software Foundation, led by International Business
Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. But the
announcement of a timetable for their availability is still
important because so many companies are betting their futures
on Unix. They hope to appeal to customers who don't want to
be tied in to one hardware supplier by their reliance on
software that runs only on that company's proprietary
operating system. And Unix requires features such as improved
security if it is to rival those other operating systems.

   OTTAWA -- Two Air Canada pilots were charged with
illegally smoking on separate Canadian domestic flights.
   The charges were the first to be filed under a year-old
law that prohibits smoking in federally regulated workplaces,
including government buildings, banks and airlines. The
charges were filed following complaints by an Air Canada
employee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If convicted, the pilots, Jack Haycock and Eppie Mulder,
could be fined up to 50 Canadian dollars (US$43). An Air
Canada spokesman said the airline will decide whether to
discipline the pilots after the court's ruling.
   The Canadian law bans smoking on all domestic flights,
most North American flights, and international flights under
six hours. The ban is to be extended to all overseas flights
in 1993.
   Air Canada, one of Canada's largest airlines, voluntarily
extended the ban to cover its longer overseas flights
starting Oct. 1. The airline estimated that 99.8% of its
flights will be smoke-free after the smoking ban is extended
next month. The ban won't apply to its
London-Bombay-Singapore route, where smoking remains popular.

   Your Money Matters:
   The Elderly Discover Reverse Mortgages
   ----

<LP>
   After years of making monthly mortgage payments to the
bank, some elderly homeowners are getting the bank to pay
them by taking out a "reverse mortgage."
   A reverse mortgage is a loan, based on the equity a
homeowner has accumulated, that can be disbursed in monthly
installments over a period of years. Terms vary, but the
amount of the installments generally depend on the borrower's
age, life expectancy and the amount of equity in the home.
And in most cases, there are no interest or principal
payments as long as the borrower is living in the home.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Up to now, finding a reverse mortgage hasn't been easy,
because only a few lenders offer them, but interest is
growing. A provision in pending legislation would
significantly expand a Federal Housing Administration program
that promotes reverse mortgages by insuring lenders against
possible losses.
   "For a lot of people, home equity is half of their net
worth," says Edward D. McCarthy, a financial planner with
Goluses &amp; Co. in Providence, R.I. "You try not to use it, but
the reality is that most of us are going to have to tap it
somehow."
   Many retirees sell their homes and move, either to smaller
quarters nearby or to a new community. But others want to
stay where they are, if they can afford to. Unlike a home
equity loan or line of credit, there's no income requirement
for a reverse mortgage, which makes it attractive to
retirees.
   Reverse mortgages aren't for everyone, however. Costs can
be high, and there's often no house to pass on to heirs at
the end. The lender usually gets most, or all, of any capital
appreciation after the reverse mortgage is taken out. What's
more, if the borrower has to move into a nursing home after a
few years, the loan will have to be repaid, usually forcing
the sale of the home.
   "People should look at the different options they have
first," says Ken Scholen, director of the National Center for
Home Equity Conversion. "A lot of people could solve their
financial problems another way."
   For the elderly who have trouble paying property taxes,
for instance, many states have tax-deferral programs. There
also are low-cost or even no-cost home-improvement loans
available to the elderly through various government agencies.
Indeed, the federally insured reverse mortgage program
requires that applicants get counseling from a third party,
usually a non-profit agency.
   Although reverse mortgages have been around for nearly a
decade, many lenders have been reluctant to take the chance
that borrowers will outlive the equity in their homes. The
federal program provides insurance against declining property
values and the possibility that a long-lived borrower will
get payments in excess of the resale value of the home.
   That program, which is operating through 50 lenders in 34
states, authorizes a total of just 2,500 reverse mortgages.
But a provision in legislation passed by both the House and
the Senate and awaiting action by a conference committee
would expand the program tenfold.
   In addition, three self-insured private lenders offer
reverse mortgages in a total of 15 states. Another two dozen
or so lenders around the country offer "term" loans, which
require repayment after a specific period of time -- usually
10 years. The federally insured program sets maximum equity
amounts, which vary by region. Many private lenders permit
borrowers to mortgage the full value of their homes. Reverse
mortgages also come with both adjustable and fixed interest
rates.
   "It's like comparing apples and oranges and grapefruits,"
says Bronwyn Belling, a housing specialist with the American
Association of Retired Persons. "They're all structured
differently."
   Like any other refinancing, there are closing costs for
such things as title searches and recording of documents.
Usually, there's an origination fee, calculated as a
percentage of the loan or the value of the house. There is
also an insurance premium, when the loan is insured, and
sometimes a monthly servicing fee. Although most if not all
the costs can be financed as part of the loan, they are added
to the balance of the loan. If the borrower dies or decides
to move after just a few years, the loan could be very
expensive.
   Still, demand for reverse mortgages is huge, says Ms.
Belling. She says the association gets at least 20 to 30
calls a day about reverse mortgages and has sent out nearly
100,000 copies of a 47-page guide to home-equity conversion
written by Mr. Scholen.
   Financial professionals say the ideal candidates for a
reverse mortgage are at least in their mid-seventies, and
physically able to remain in their homes for a number of
years. The first mortgage should be paid off, or have very
little remaining.
   "The older you are, the more money you're going to get,"
says Marguerite Quis, a vice president at Interchange State
Bank in Saddle Brook, N.J., one of the FHA-insured lenders.
Payments under a typical federally insured loan, for
instance, would be $272 a month for a 70-year-old with a home
valued at $100,000. An 85-year-old getting a reverse mortgage
on the same home would get $599 a month. Ms. Quis says one of
Interchange's borrowers, a 97-year-old widow, is getting
$2,700 a month.
   While reverse mortgages are designed primarily for elderly
retirees, others have used them, too. James Burke, chairman
of American Homestead Mortgage Inc. in Mount Laurel, N.J.,
one of the private insurers, says one borrower used a reverse
mortgage to finance her grandchild's college education. Mr.
Scholen of the National Center for Home Equity Conversion
says a woman in her mid-30s used proceeds of a reverse
mortgage to be able to stay at home for a few years with her
first child.
   Not all retirees want to stay in their homes. "If it were
me, I'd rather sell my house and move to an apartment," says
William J. Ruckstuhl, associate professor of finance at
American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., who's 55 years old. "Who
wants to mow the lawn and haul the trash?"

   PARTNERSHIPS created as tax shelters face greater
scrutiny.
   The IRS plans to tighten regulation of installment sales
of partnerships being used to create artificial losses for
some large corporate taxpayers. The action follows complaints
from some tax advisers about a strategy promoted by Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. and other financial institutions. Merrill Lynch
declines to comment, asserting it doesn't give tax advice.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The controversial tax plan typically involves the creation
of a partnership by several investors, including one free of
U.S. tax liability who ultimately sells out to its
large-taxpayer partner once the partnership generates losses.
The large taxpayer then uses the losses to offset other
gains. The IRS, decrying such arrangements as "abusive,"
warns it will examine partnerships to see if "they lack
economic substance or are entered into for tax avoidance
purposes."
   The IRS says it may issue a revenue ruling or rewrite its
regulation to block the disputed plans.
                                                                                                       

   THERE ARE NO LOBBIES at tax summit. But that doesn't stop
lobbyists.
   The budget negotiations at Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington may result in the biggest tax bill ever, but the
distant location makes it a challenge for lobbyists eager to
have their views heard. Many turn to gossip to make their
points. Some call each other with feigned confidence to
proclaim that Democrats want a higher corporate tax, that
Republicans want to cut the advertising deduction and that,
last Friday, the deal was finally done -- all wrong. One
supposedly high-powered law firm retypes a day-old Democratic
offer made blurry from repeated copying, then spreads it
around.
   Even lawmakers and their staffs are cut out from what's
going on. When asked by a lobbyist for the latest plans, one
GOP aide sends two lists obviously prepared by another
lobbyist, and mostly in error. Last week, House Majority
Leader Gephardt advised fellow negotiators to skip President
Bush's congressional address so they could duck menacing
questions from colleagues. Many did. When one negotiator
ventured on the House floor, he was surrounded by angry
members, prompting a hasty retreat.
                                                                                                       

   CHEATING can be hazardous if your accountant is a
government snitch.
   Roman Sobolevsky is appealing a federal court conviction
for obstruction of justice and conspiracy, arguing that the
government violated his privacy by enlisting accountant
Robert Freshman -- who has since died -- as an "agent
provocateur" to seek out Mr. Sobolevsky as a client and then
inform on his dealings. Mr. Sobolevsky in May was sentenced
to 33 months in prison, given three years probation and fined
$60,000 after a jury found him guilty in a case involving
grand-jury testimony about the path of two checks totaling
$2,500.
   Mr. Sobolevsky's appeal alleges the government came after
him because it was trying to connect him with gasoline
bootlegging to evade excise taxes. That effort failed, the
appeal says. But then, says the appeal, Mr. Freshman agreed
to cooperate with the government to escape prosecution on
another matter. In recruiting Mr. Freshman, the government
was "extraordinarily intrusive and violated the defendant's
right to a confidential relationship between himself and his
accountant," the appeal says.
   The Justice Department said it won't comment on the appeal
until next month.
                                                                                                       

   BARGAINS ABROAD may prove costly for returning
Californians. Consultant Vertex Inc. says the state screens
Customs Service declarations completed by residents coming
home and asks them to pay a use tax on any goods brought in.
                                                                                                       

   NEVER MIND. The IRS, in response to charges leveled by a
whistle-blower group, says it forgot to sign 31 internal
documents covering 10,700 tax assessments. The goof could
cost the government $22.5 million.
                                                                                                       

   PINCER MOVEMENT: Mexico is the 12th country to agree to
simultaneous tax audits with the IRS, Research Institute of
America says. The countries will conduct separate
examinations but share results.
                                                                                                       

   IT TAKES MORE than religious conviction to get a tax
exemption.
   The Tax Court rules that vegetarian restaurants and
health-food stores run by Seventh-day Adventists shouldn't be
exempt from taxes even though they are dedicated to carrying
out the church's work. Upholding the IRS, the court says
Living Faith Inc., a not-for-profit corporation founded by
Adventists, is too commercial to pass muster under Section
501(c)(3) of the Tax Code as a tax-exempt organization
"operated exclusively for religious purposes."
   The court didn't question the sincerity of the church's
beliefs on diet and health, nor did it take issue with Living
Faith's contention that it was furthering church doctrine.
The court noted that Living Faith provided free meals once a
month, passed out church literature and offerred vegetarian
cooking classes. But, observed the court, the stores also
competed with commercial firms, charging as much or more.
   Living Faith's beliefs "are not enough" to overcome its
commercial nature, the court holds.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Being Arty Aardvark has its perils. The Tax Court,
citing IRS regulations, says a partner whose name comes first
alphabetically is "tax matters partner" when none is
designated and all share equal stakes. . . . Striking out on
a balk? New York enforcers cite five concessionaires at two
baseball-card shows for failing to comply with the state's
sales-tax law.

   S&amp;L Bailout Agency Cancels TV Auction
   Of Certain Real Estate Assets Set Nov. 15

   WASHINGTON -- The savings-and-loan bailout agency, in a
blow to its efforts to stir up publicity for its real estate
sales, canceled its highly promoted November auction and said
it's unlikely another auction could be mounted before year
end.
   Cancellation of the Nov. 15 auction was the latest of a
number of setbacks for the beleaguered agency. Though only
about $300 million of the Resolution Trust Corp.'s $18
billion in real estate assets were to be offered, the RTC
hoped the high profile of the event, with satellite
connections to nine U.S. cities and London and Tokyo, would
draw hundreds of bidders and stimulate interest in other
properties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Instead, officials said a dispute with the auctioneer had
caused them to cancel the event, and a new auction would have
to be planned almost from scratch, with a different bag of
properties. "It's probable an international auction won't be
how we will sell these properties," said David Cooke, the
RTC's executive director.
   The properties, which include about 70 office buildings,
hotels, and shopping centers, probably will be sold
individually using sealed bids rather than auctions. He added
that another big auction intended to whip up investor
interest almost surely couldn't be held "before the end of
the year."
   William Seidman, chairman of the RTC, said: "This does not
mean we are not going to proceed with auctions." But he
indicated that the agency would move carefully in setting up
another one. "It says that unfortunately we didn't do the job
we should have done," Mr. Seidman said. "We got a contractor
who couldn't perform and that's our fault," he added.
   The RTC said the auctioneer it hired, Auction Co. of
America, failed in the past few days to put up $2 million
earmarked for marketing costs, as required under the contract
for the auction. The $2 million was supposed to be part of a
$2,850,000 fund, with the rest contributed by the RTC.
   Jim Gall, president of Auction Co. of America, accused the
RTC of handling the planned auction incompetently. He said
the RTC had scared away investors by failing to set minimum
prices and by pulling properties from the initial list
released in early August.
   Indeed, Mr. Seidman said the RTC already had received
offers on four properties for a total of $39 million.
   Mr. Gall contended that the RTC had removed the four
properties from the auction. The RTC is "bragging that {the
offers are} a good point and I find it very upsetting," Mr.
Gall said. For an auction to work, Mr. Gall asserted, bidders
must know "the property will be there on auction day."
Otherwise, he said, they won't spend the money necessary to
research the properties. For the same reason, he said,
bidders were frightened because the minimum prices hadn't yet
been set.
   Mr. Gall acknowledged that he didn't put up the $2 million
as was required once the RTC and the company agreed on a
budget for the auction. But Mr. Gall said the negotiations on
the budget ended only two weeks ago, and that he already has
spent "just under" $2 million on accountants, public
relations and other costs.
   Mr. Gall said he tried to submit the expenses in lieu of
the $2 million, but the RTC asked for cash. He said the RTC's
actions in handling the auction scared away investors from
whom he tried to raise the money to meet the RTC's demands.
   The RTC's Mr. Cooke strongly disputed Mr. Gall's
assertions. "He ain't sunk $2 million into it," Mr. Cooke
contended, adding: "We deny that it's our fault he didn't
come up with the $2 million."

   NEW YORK -- KPMG said its board, as expected, elected Jim
Butler as chairman of its international practice, succeeding
Larry Horner.
   KPMG, the international accounting and consulting firm
formed in the 1987 merger of Peat Marwick International and
Klynveld Main Goerdeler, also named Johann Steenmeijer to the
new post of chief executive and deputy chairman, effective
Nov. 1. Both Mr. Butler, 61 years old and Mr. Steenmeijer,
57, are currently senior partners in the British and Dutch
practices, respectively of the firm, which is based in
Amsterdam.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Horner, 56, said in early August that he wouldn't seek
re-election as chairman of the international practice or of
the U.S. practice, KPMG Peat Marwick. Last week, Jon C.
Madonna, 47, was nominated chairman and chief executive of
the U.S. practice. He needs majority approval of the U.S.
practice's 1,850 partners, who are scheduled to vote Oct. 3
and 4, when Mr. Horner's term in that practice expires. KPMG
has a total of 6,100 partners worldwide.
   Mr. Horner took over the top positions at Peat Marwick in
1984 and at the international organization in 1988. He was
said to be the driving force behind the merger of the firms
into the largest of the Big Six accounting and consulting
firms. He said in declining to seek another term that the
firm needed an executive who could stay longer in the
positions, which carry six-year terms. The mandatory
retirement age for the positions is 60.

   DETROIT -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is
reviewing $40 billion of Ford Motor Co.'s debt for possible
downgrade.
   Moody's review was prompted by the softness in the U.S.
auto market, said Carol Verscell, the rating agency's
assistant vice president. She said Ford remains secure in the
high-grade area, and will be reviewed again in the next
several weeks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ford has lowered its estimate for overall car and truck
sales in 1990. Ford had forecast the U.S. market at 14.3
million cars and trucks in 1990, which is down from its
original estimate of 14.5 million vehicles. Ford predicted
the sluggish sales would continue into the first half of
1991.
   Moody's said it also will assess the potential capital
requirements of Ford's wholly owned subsidiary, First
Nationwide Bank. About $1.7 billion of First Nationwide's
debt is being reviewed, Moody's said.
   Ford yesterday said Moody's action "isn't warranted," and
questioned the rating agency's decision to review its debt in
light of "what may prove to be a short term situation." Ford
said it will discuss the action with Moody's officials.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Ford closed
at $34.25, up 50 cents. The announcement came less than 30
minutes before the stock market closed.
   Among the ratings now under review by Moody's are the
double-A-2 rating for Ford's senior debt and double-A-3 on
the company's subordinated debt.
   Moody's also is reviewing ratings for First Nationwide
Bank, including the single-A-1 rating on its senior debt and
the single-A-2 rating on its subordinated debt.

   Soaring Oil Costs Are Cited,
   But Core Inflation Rate
   Gives Rise to Concern

   WASHINGTON -- Driven by soaring oil prices in the
aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, consumer prices
jumped 0.8% last month, the Labor Department reported,
confirming fears that the Middle East crisis would ignite a
surge in inflation.
   The rise in the government's consumer price index, which
measures the change in retail prices of an array of goods and
services, was twice July's increase and by far the biggest
monthly climb since a bitter cold wave sent consumer prices
soaring 1.1% in January.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A 4.3% jump in energy prices was largely responsible, but
many economists said the report shows the nation has a
substantial inflation problem apart from the oil-price jolt.
Excluding energy, prices still rose substantially during the
month, climbing 0.4%. Leaving out food prices as well -- to
get what many economists consider the core rate of inflation
-- the index increased 0.5%.
   "What's upsetting is the core inflation rate -- ex food
and energy -- is now rising at an annual rate over 5%," said
Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh. "The danger is that the oil-price increase
spreads throughout the economy. This will push up the core
inflation rate as it gets passed through to an array of goods
and services."
   "I think this month's number is a very good
characterization of our inflation problem," said Joel Popkin,
an economist who used to oversee the compilation of the
consumer price index for the Labor Department. "Half of the
inflation came from the core rate -- problems we had before
the {Middle East} crisis, and half came from the invasion."
   The economy now faces the prospect of recession and the
highest inflation rate in nine years. Economists fear that
the burden of higher energy prices will lead consumers to
curb spending and lead businesses to pare investment,
pitching the already-shaky economy into a downturn.
   The economy's fate could depend largely on the Federal
Reserve, which for more than two years has been battling
inflation by keeping interest rates high. The central bank is
currently under pressure to lower interest rates to stimulate
economic activity by making credit cheaper. But analysts
believe the latest inflation figures -- combined with a
report last week that producer prices catapulted 1.3% in
August -- will make Fed officials reluctant to ease their
grip on credit.
   Meanwhile, more bad inflation news looms. Oil prices have
continued to rise on world markets in September, and some
businesses, including airlines, trucking companies and
petrochemical producers, have already announced plans to
raise prices.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, gaining control of a
large share of the world's oil reserves, crude-oil prices
shot up. At the same time, gasoline stations across the U.S.
almost immediately boosted prices, long before the jump in
crude prices worked their way through the system.
   According to the Labor Department, consumer gasoline
prices jumped 7.6% in August, while fuel-oil prices rose
11.9%.
   Largely because of the oil-price rises, an index measuring
transportation costs shot up 1.8% while an index gauging
housing costs jumped 0.7%.
   Medical-care prices continued their climb, rising 0.9% for
the second straight month and bringing their rise over the
past year to 9.5%.
   Food prices increased 0.3% after growing 0.4% in July.
   All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

   Economy:
   Slowdown Spreads to the Service Sector,
   Where Production Increases Only 2.5%
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- The slowdown has finally reached the
economy's biggest, most resilient sector: services.
   For the past year and a half, as U.S. manufacturers shaved
workers from their payrolls, businesses that provide services
had continued to expand vigorously, adding new employees at
an average of 171,000 a month in 1989. While increasing
numbers of Americans began to think twice about buying a new
car or new home, they continued to spend heartily on an array
of services from telephone calls to airline travel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's changing.
   Except for the health field, job growth in service
industries was virtually flat last month, according to the
Labor Department. Service-sector production has risen just
2.5% in the year ended in July after rising 4.2% in the
previous year, according to an index compiled by the
Coalition of Service Industries, a group formed by a number
of large, service-oriented companies. Growth in personal
spending on services has tapered off since the end of last
year, Commerce Department figures show.
   "The service-producing sector has also weakened after many
years of strong growth during the expansion," the
commissioner of labor statistics, Janet Norwood, told
Congress earlier this month.
   Services are never as prone to economic ups and downs as
manufacturing, construction and other segments of the economy
that are more sensitive to interest rates. People are more
likely to forgo a new color TV or a new house than a haircut
or car insurance, economists explain.
   But the decline in housing and manufacturing has "gone on
for long enough and there are enough uncertainties in the
picture that consumers are starting to identify other areas
where they cannot spend," says Paul McCracken, an economist
at the University of Michigan.
   "Those who are depending on services to forestall
recession should not rest easy," Steven Strongin, an
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, wrote
recently.
   Urbach, Kahn &amp; Werlin, an accounting firm based in Albany,
N.Y., hasn't replaced any of the 17 people who've left the
firm's nine offices this year. "In the past, when the economy
was better, we would have immediately rehired and probably
put on additional staff," says Steven Fischer, Urbach's
president.
   Like that of many firms that provide services to other
companies, Urbach's business is slowing because its clients'
business is slowing. "Many of our clients are not
experiencing growth, they are not having a good year, not
looking for acquisitions and not expanding their business,"
Mr. Fischer says. "As they suffer a bit, we suffer a bit."
   Other industries are victims of increasing consumer
caution. Many retailers are trimming holiday buying plans.
Mr. McCracken notes that tourism in his state of Michigan is
significantly down. USAir recently announced layoffs of
thousands of workers. Because fewer people are booking
cruises and tours, Frommer Travel Service in Washington,
D.C., has decided not to replace a three-day-a-week employee
who left the firm two months ago. "Basically we are not
overwhelmed at all" with the remaining staff, says Larry
Frommer, the agency's president. If the employee had left a
year ago, he said, the firm would have had to replace her.
   "This is the kind of thing, I think, that is not
immediately visible," says Norman Robertson, chief economist
at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "If you have a major layoff at
a manufacturing facility, that gets the headlines. If
McDonald's is laying off two people, if the local department
store isn't hiring this year, that doesn't get headlines."
   Many economists say the weakening in the service sector
isn't surprising and was bound to happen. "When the whole
economy slows down you know what you get: everything slowing
to the point where manufacturing is actually decreasing and
services are growing less than they used to," says Charles
Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. "I don't think that's anything but typical of an
economy that's growing sideways."
   But the fact that one of the most vibrant parts of the
economy during the nearly eight-year expansion is now dimming
underscores the fragility of the U.S. economy. And it has
worrisome implications for large numbers of Americans, for
the service sector is huge. It employs more than seven of
every 10 American workers and accounts for 68% of the value
of the nation's output. "That's the sector now that's really
become the source of income and wealth generation for an
overwhelmingly large portion of the U.S. economy," says
Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
   Most analysts, however, stress that the service sector is
still growing, and probably will continue to expand even if
the overall economy sinks into a downturn. After all, even
during the deep recession of 1981-82, service employment
continued to edge up.
   "I think it is reasonable to expect that sluggish growth
in the service sector would finally happen, in terms of what
is going on in the economy. However it is still growth," says
Margaret Wigglesworth, executive director of the Coalition of
Service Industries.

   NEW YORK -- Norman Lear's ACT III Communications Inc. is
scaling back some of its ambitious plans to become a
diversified media company, folding some properties and
seeking buyers for others.
   According to company officials, ACT III has quietly folded
two of its trade magazines and laid off 19 people at its ACT
III Publishing unit. The subscription lists of the two
publications have been sold to PSN Publications Inc., a unit
of United Newspapers PLC.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   ACT III officials said that Mr. Lear, who owns 80% of ACT
III, is preparing to sell the publishing unit and
significantly restructure his company. ACT III, based in Los
Angeles, owns TV stations, movie theaters, and trade
magazines.
   Mr. Lear couldn't be reached for comment, and Robert C.
Gardner, ACT III Publishing's chief operating officer, said
"we are downsizing ACT III publishing. It's clear ACT III
will not be an aggressive, acquisition-minded company in the
future." Individuals close to the company said Mr. Lear wants
to eliminate unprofitable areas, reduce the size of the
company, which grew quickly in the late 1980s, and return to
television production.
   Mr. Lear formed ACT III Communications in 1985 after
selling his television operation to Coca-Cola Co. for $485
million.
   The two magazines that will be closed are Corporate Video
Decisions and BME's Television Engineering. ACT III continues
to publish an array of other music, television, and
media-related trade magazines.
   Speculation has grown in recent weeks that ACT III would
sell two of its music trade magazines, Mix and Electronic
Musician, to Affiliated Publications Inc. An Affiliated
Publications' spokesman said the company would not comment.
   The slashing of the publishing unit follows the recent
sudden resignations of Thomas B. McGrath, ACT III president
and chief operating officer, and Paul David Schaeffer,
president of ACT III Publishing. Company executives said
Messrs. McGrath and Schaeffer were blamed by Mr. Lear for
spending too much on acquiring new properties and hiring the
wrong people to operate them.
   Mr. Lear would sell the entire company if the price was
right, but it's a poor time to sell TV stations, movie
theaters, or trade magazines, according to the company
officials. Paramount Communications Corp. recently looked
closely at the stations, but backed away.
   Mr. Lear is currently producing a new sitcom for CBS Inc.

   A New York investor group led by Douglas A. Kass boosted
its stake in H.H. Robertson Co. to 18.8% and said it will
launch a proxy battle to fight management's efforts to merge
with another construction firm.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
the group said that it will solicit proxies for an upcoming
special shareholder's meeting. At the meeting, holders will
vote on the company's proposed $150 million cash and stock
buy-out of Ceco Industries, Inc., of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.

   Mr. Kass couldn't be reached for comment.
   After the buy-out, Robertson's shares outstanding would
double between 13.5 million and 14 million. It would give 25%
of the stock to Ceco and another 25% to Swiss investment
company Frontera S.A. which agreed to invest $40 million to
help fund the cash portion of the buy-out in exchange for
25%, or between 3.3 million and 4 million shares of
Roberston.
   Analysts now believe the Kass group is trying to stave off
the merger to generate buyer interest in Robertson.
   First City Financial Corp., a concern controlled by the
Belzberg family with a 25% stake in Robertson, agreed to
support the buy-out.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Robertson closed unchanged at $8.

   CHICAGO -- A power failure at the Chicago Board of Trade
yesterday morning delayed the start of trading in Treasury
bonds and other financial futures for one hour and 25 minutes
to 8:45 a.m. CDT.
   A futures exchange spokesman said that a failure of a
transformer on the exchange's 13th floor caused the delay.

   With the Chicago market blacked out, some brokerage firms
routed orders to the London International Financial Futures
Exchange, which trades a futures contract similar to the
Treasury bond futures listed on the CBOT. The surge of orders
from Chicago boosted Liffe's Tbond volume by several thousand
contracts, but its average volume remained a fraction of the
CBOT's estimated 250,000 contracts traded yesterday.
   The temporary blackout didn't affect futures trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

   R.H. Macy Is Planning to Buy Back

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- A top R.H. Macy &amp; Co. executive said the
retailer has drafted plans to buy back sizable amounts of its
junk bonds, which have sunk in recent weeks.
   A big bond buy-back, at a hefty discount from face value,
could significantly cut Macy's $600 million annual cash
interest bill on its $5.8 billion in debt. Likely sources of
money for an open-market bond repurchase are bank loans and
the possible sale of as much as a 20% equity stake in Macy.
If the retailer carries out its plans, that will almost
certainly be seen as upbeat news in the financial community.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bond analysts and traders have grown increasingly worried
about Macy's financial health in the past month, amid signs
that U.S. retail sales are slumping. The company's 14.5%
bonds of 1998 currently trade at 54 cents on the dollar, and
lion annual cash interest bill on its $5.8 billion in debt.
Likely sources of money for an open-market bond repurchase
are bank loans and the possible sale of as much as a 20%
equity stake in Macy. If the retailer carries out its plans,
that will almost certainly be seen as upbeat news in the
other Macy issues are even lower.
   Macy executive vice president Myron Ullman said in an
interview that the company is looking at "five or six"
different ways to finance a big bond repurchase. Mr. Ullman
said Macy directors, at a board meeting Monday, were shown an
extensive roadmap for how the company could buy large amounts
of its bonds.
   Macy has about $1.6 billion face value of junk bonds
outstanding. They were issued soon after the retailer was
taken private in a 1986 leveraged buy-out.
   This summer, Macy sold a token 1% equity stake to a real
estate developer for $15 million. Macy used part of the
proceeds to retire $45 million face value of its 16.5%
discount bonds of 2006, which traded then at about 20 cents
on the dollar, Mr. Ullman said. Macy also bought about $5
million of its 14.5% bonds of 2001, which were trading at
about 45 cents on the dollar.
   Macy wants to retire more junk bonds the same way, Mr.
Ullman said. "This is a great opportunity," he asserted. "We
never dreamed we would have the opportunity to buy bonds at
such a discount."
   Macy, though, could face a tough time lining up financing.
The company's two lead banks, Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and
Bankers Trust New York Corp., recently lent money for a
comparable bond-repurchase program by RJR Nabisco Inc., but
did so only after long negotiations and the payment of
unusually high loan fees.
   Macy's other likely source of cash is a sizable equity
infusion. The company's owners include such deep-pocketed
companies and individuals as General Electric Co., with a
20.2% stake; Loews Corp., with a 12.1% stake; Mutual Shares
Corp., with a 12.1% stake, and developer Alfred Taubman, with
a 4.1% stake.
   Mr. Ullman reaffirmed that Macy would consider selling a
20% stake in the company for $300 million. That price -- five
times what Macy's original equity investors paid in 1986 --
is in line with the company's asking price in previous talks
with potential buyers. It is unclear, though, whether a new
or existing investor would pay that much.
   Last week, several junk-bond analysts cut their estimates
of operating profit for Macy's Christmas quarter or for the
company's fiscal year ended next July 31. One of them,
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. analyst Ray
Garea, cited "the softening retail environment."
   Even though Macy's bonds are as cheap as ever, Mr. Garea
said, his short-term outlook for the company has switched to
"negative" from neutral. Similarly, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. analyst
Michael Cha said he is lowering his "worst-case" estimate of
Macy's Christmas quarter operating profit by more than 10%.
   As recently as last July, Macy's internal forecasts called
for 2% year-to-year growth in same-store sales for the six
months ending Jan. 31. But because of signs that retail sales
are slowing, Mr. Ullman said, Macy now expects flat
same-store sales in the period. Even that forecast may be
optimistic, he conceded.
   Mr. Ullman reiterated Macy's earlier forecast that
operating profit -- or profit before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization -- would total $654 million for
the six months ending next Jan. 31. He acknowledged that many
analysts regard that target as unachievable in the current
retailing slump.
   "Before the Kuwait invasion and the recession in the U.S.,
Macy was on target for a profit recovery," said Barrie
Littel, an analyst at First Boston Corp. "Now anyone
realistic has to trim their numbers."
   Last year, Macy turned in a disappointing $416 million
operating profit for the six months ended Jan. 31.
   Even if the Christmas selling season isn't much better
than last year's, Mr. Ullman said, Macy is controlling its
inventory more tightly and should show improved profit
margins. He also said Macy's reduced buying of merchandise is
leaving it with plenty of unused bank credit, which helps
build confidence among shippers.

   WASHINGTON -- Top congressional leaders took over budget
negotiations with the White House, after lower-ranking
lawmakers failed to resolve the key remaining issues in
marathon bargaining.
   "The talks are not collapsed," House Republican Leader
Robert Michel said, after Democratic leaders and their GOP
counterparts met with top Bush administration negotiators.
"We are just moving them to a different stage."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators from both parties said they narrowed their
differences substantially during 11 days of closed-door talks
at Andrews Air Force Base near here. Indeed, the offers put
on the table late Monday have many common elements, such as a
new tax on luxury goods and a goal of $120 billion of
spending cuts in benefits programs over the next five years.
   But, as several people close to the talks have been
assuming for months, the final -- and most difficult -- calls
now must be made at the top ranks by Senate Democratic Leader
George Mitchell, House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Mich.) and
President Bush himself.
   Democrats insist that the major stumbling block to the
long-sought accord to reduce the federal budget deficit is
the administration's desire to cut the capital-gains tax rate
without also raising income tax rates on wealthier Americans.
"The problem . . . centers around the insistence of the
administration to reduce the capital-gains tax, " Rep. Foley
said.
   Republicans, while sensitive to Democrats' criticism that
the capital-gains cut is a break for the rich, emphasized
that other major issues remain, including the rules by which
a five-year fiscal blueprint will be enforced and the details
of spending cuts. "To suggest that we were very close, except
for that {capital-gains taxes}, was exceptionally
inaccurate," a Republican participant said.
   With only 12 days left before across-the-board spending
cuts are imposed by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law,
Sen. Mitchell of Maine and Rep. Foley are to meet again today
with White House Budget Director Richard Darman, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu. Also participating will be the top Republican
leaders, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas and Illinois Rep. Michel,
as well as House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of
Missouri.
   Excluded will be some negotiators with particularly
inveterate views, including Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.),
Sen. James Sasser (D., Tenn.), Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas)
and Rep. Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.).
   Even if the high-level talks produce an accord, however,
ratification by the full Congress isn't guaranteed. Just
yesterday, Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee
privately complained to Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.)
that budget negotiators weren't testing their proposals
sufficiently with their colleagues, and warned that a
deficit-reduction package might be rejected as a result.
   Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush said,
"Everybody . . . agrees that they've come quite a way, but
it's not done, by a long shot." He avoided any criticism of
Democrats in campaign speeches yesterday, but reiterated his
eagerness to cut capital-gains taxes. "This is not a tax
break for the rich," he said in Denver. "It will create
jobs."
   In a sixth round of proposals, Democrats and Republicans
on Monday night traded stripped-down plans that were crafted
as much for public consumption as for each party. Democrats
said they would give up most of their spending and tax
initiatives if Republicans gave up the quest for lower
capital-gains taxes. Both proposals would reduce the deficit
by about $50 billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and
by about $500 billion over five years.
   On taxes, the basic division is how to offset a cut in the
capital-gains tax rate. Democrats proposed a 20% income-tax
surcharge on couples with incomes of more than $200,000 and
individuals with incomes above $125,000, effectively raising
their marginal tax rate to 33.6% from the current top nominal
rate of 28%.
   Republicans concede that any compromise will have to raise
taxes on the rich and have offered several alternatives,
including limiting total tax deductions for upper-income
taxpayers. Their last offer was to limit to $10,000 the
deduction for state and local income taxes for taxpayers with
incomes above $200,000.
   Several Republicans complained privately that Sen.
Mitchell, long a proponent of higher tax rates on the rich,
was standing in the way of a compromise.
   Though both parties would raise taxes by a net of $130
billion over five years, Democrats propose additional tax
increases to cover expanded proposed tax breaks for
lower-income taxpayers, as well as a variety of user fees
they didn't count as taxes. "The Democratic package has too
many taxes in it," Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), a
negotiator, said.
   In a previously undisclosed area of agreement on taxes,
both parties proposed to forbid corporations from deducting
interest on tax underpayments, raising about $4.5 billion
next year. The two parties also agreed to increase taxes on
life insurance companies by $2 billion in the first year and
by $10 billion over five years.
   Both parties endorsed a new 10% tax on luxury goods, to be
applied to the purchase price in excess of $30,000 for cars,
boats and yachts; $5,000 for jewelry; $1,000 for electronics;
$500 for furs and the entire price of private aircraft under
5,000 pounds. And both parties support an increase in taxes
on liquor, beer and wine, to yield about $14 billion over
five years, though the details weren't described in the
proposals.
   Democrats proposed increasing the tobacco tax, now 16
cents on a pack of cigarettes, by four cents a pack in 1991
and an additional four cents in 1993. Though Democrats said
Republicans have tentatively agreed, several Republicans deny
this -- and their proposal doesn't show any such increase.
   Though both sides would raise energy taxes, the Democrats
would raise $49 billion over five years through higher energy
taxes. The Republicans, who would limit increased energy
taxes to refined petroleum products, would raise $7 billion.
   On defense spending, both parties are converging on a plan
crafted by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Armed
Services Committee. The administration estimates the plan
would reduce projected Pentagon spending by about $175
billion over five years; some Democrats say it would save
even more. In what remains an important sticking point,
however, Democrats are willing to lock in the defense cuts
for only the next two years, while Republicans want to set
totals for the next five years.
   Democrats, in short, want to leave open the possibility of
tapping the defense budget to fund domestic spending programs
in future years, while Republicans want to limit increases in
domestic spending, other than benefit or entitlement
programs, to the rate of inflation.
   On benefit programs, both parties said they want to cut
projected spending by about $120 billion over five years,
though Republicans said the Democrats' proposals fall short
of that mark. Neither plan would touch Social Security
benefits.
   In the latest proposals, Republicans proposed deeper cuts
in Medicare, calling for, among other things, increasing the
deductible on coverage for doctors' services, known as Part
B, to $150 from the current $75 and increasing the deductible
with inflation. They would raise the premium for Medicare,
now at $28.60 a month, so that the premium covers 30% of the
total costs instead of 25%, as the law now provides. Details
of the Democratic plan weren't available.
   Both parties also proposed substantial cuts in farm
subsidies over five years. Democrats would reduce them by
$11.8 billion from levels projected in the farm bill that has
passed both houses of Congress. Republicans would reduce
subsidies by $13.3 billion. Sponsors of the farm bill
explicitly delayed making any substantial cutbacks in
subsidies, pending the outcome of the budget summit.
   As they have from the start, the Republicans pushed for a
substantially tougher revision of the Gramm-Rudman law than
Democrats are prepared to accept to enforce the terms of any
budget accord. "Their current enforcement {plan} is, `Trust
me.'" Rep. Gingrich complained.
   With the White House forecasting a fiscal 1991 deficit of
about $250 billion, neither Democrats nor Republicans would
try to meet the law's $64 billion deficit target; rather,
they are expected to amend the law to avoid triggering
across-the-board spending cuts.
   Without any change in the law, spending cuts amounting to
more than $85 billion will be triggered on Oct. 1. Though
there is substantial skepticism in Congress, the
administration vows it won't agree to waive the law unless
there is a budget agreement.
   "The clock is ticking," Mr. Bush said.

   Are Supermarket Aisles
   A Haven From Recession?

   NEW YORK -- Salomon Brothers is putting out the word: "Now
is the time to buy supermarket stocks."
   Salomon's thinking, and that of Wall Street generally, is
that even in a recession, people keep on eating. But this
time the stocks aren't cheap. Going into the early-80s
recession, shares of the major supermarket chains traded at
about eight times earnings. Now they trade at about 19 times
the past year's per-share earnings, meaning that the market
is betting on growth even as a recession looms.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And as anyone who shops for groceries knows, the
supermarket of today doesn't resemble the one of 10 years ago
-- and therein lies a reason for investors to be wary.
   What's on the shelves nowadays isn't as indispensable as
in the past. In the prosperous 1980s, supermarkets added
scores of fresh and prepared foods to the traditional array
of canned and packaged goods, and profit margins exploded.
Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea's gross margin on sales, for
instance, surged to about 25% from 22%.
   Where it once offered 125 items of produce, A&amp;P now sells
300 fruits and vegetables -- including, says Michael Rourke,
a spokesman, "things I hadn't heard of before."
   A&amp;P's customers are spending at its new fresh seafood
counters, and at its bakeries and delicatessens and at
counters stocked with freshly prepared, ready-to-serve
gourmet foods.
   And, to take another example, at rapidly modernizing
Safeway, margins have soared by nearly two percentage points
since 1987 as the chain has introduced everything from live
lobster to takeout food prepared in Safeway's "complete
Chinese kitchens."
   Thus, the question isn't whether people will continue to
get their three squares. It is, to quote Mr. Rourke: "Will
they keep eating fresh seafood or switch because it's too
expensive? Will they quit buying prepared foods?
   "This is a question we have discussed quite a bit and we
don't know the answer," Mr. Rourke says. The period in which
the industry revamped itself coincided with "eight years of
good times."
   The answer is critical -- and not just for A&amp;P. According
to Salomon's Debra Levin, many newer stores garner as much as
50% of sales from "perimeter" departments such as delis,
bakeries, expanded produce, meat, seafood, floral sections
and pharmacies.
   The gross margin is 35% to 40% on fresh fish, store-baked
breads, produce and homemade chicken salad. The margin on
canned soup is 15% to 20%; on packaged breads, 10% to 15%. (A
store that sells for $1 an item costing it 90 cents has a 10%
gross margin).
   And with the advent of tough times in the Northeast, A&amp;P
says its sales growth has slowed. "The general economy has
slowed down," Mr. Rourke says. "People are watching what they
spend."
   Giant Food, the dominant chain in Washington, D.C., also
may be losing steam, says Oppenheimer's Edward Comeau.
Giant's gross margins, at 30%, are said to be the industry's
highest. Yet Giant's sales growth at stores open more than a
year has tailed off to a paltry 2.1% in the first half of
1990, after roaring ahead at about a 7% rate for three years.
David Sykes, chief financial officer, cites the downbeat
local economy and adds: "We haven't seen any shift in buying
patterns, but we may. People may be going where the specials
are."
   Many analysts expect supermarkets to hang on to a good
chunk of their newer, high-profit business no matter how the
economy fares. Prepared foods appeal to the two-income
families where no one has time to slice and dice. Fresh
vegetables and fish have become a staple for health-conscious
Americans who measure the actuarial effect of every bite.
   Then, too, the percentage of disposable personal income
that Americans spend on eating at home has shrunk steadily,
to 7.3% today from 14.1% in 1960, according to the U.S.
Department of Labor. Some analysts predict that consumers who
need to tighten their belts are unlikely to do so at the
supermarket. But their view is certainly debatable: If one's
spouse is out of work, grilled cheese tastes awfully good.
Supermarkets are full of shoppers wheeling down the aisles,
squinting at price labels to save a few pennies per item.
   Although grocers have fared better than other industries
in past recessions, they haven't been immune. Typically, they
find it harder to raise prices, and thus, harder to maintain
margins. "Our best guess is we're reasonably
recession-resistant," says Patrick Totman, Safeway senior
vice president. "I don't think anyone is truly
recession-proof."
   But the market is expecting supermarkets to grow, not just
tread water. And if people aren't likely to skip meals in bad
times, it is also dubious that they will start eating more.
To grow, supermarkets either must steal market share from
other stores or become more efficient.
   Supermarket analysts know this, and profess not to be
worried. They are bulls -- with fingers crossed. "Companies
Should Hold Up Well in Mild Recession" says a recent report
by Shearson Lehman's Kimberly Walin, a fan, among others, of
Albertson's and Kroger. Yet in her generally upbeat report, a
caveat draws the reader's eye: "The industry's change makes
direct comparisons with (earlier) recessions not totally
objective . . . If we were to enter a very sharp recession,
the industry's product mix evolution could make it a bit more
vulnerable."
   Sutro &amp; Co.'s Jonathan Ziegler also sees supermarkets as a
haven in rocky times. In a report touting Albertson's,
American Stores and Safeway, Mr. Ziegler gushes over the
modern supermarket's new look -- in his words, "the exciting
presentation in many markets." But his excitement
notwithstanding, he also notes that "in recent months,
same-store sales growth apparently has begun to slow in
certain markets." He adds, almost as an afterthought: "We now
detect some signs that price competition may be reintroduced
on a selective basis . . . Thus, we have recently scaled back
our sales growth assumptions for the balance of this year."
(Late yesterday, American Stores announced it is exploring
the sale of Acme Markets, its 275-store East Coast unit.)
   If a recession does take hold, Mr. Ziegler and others
argue that stores should see an increase in customer traffic,
because people would avoid restaurants and eat more often at
home. Safeway's Mr. Totman expects that while a downturn
might lead some high-margin Safeway shoppers to switch to
frozen dinners, "other people who are dining in Chinese
restaurants will buy (Safeway's) takeout Chinese food."
   Not all of the supermarket industry's improvement in the
'80s can be attributed to high-profit foods. Its warehousing
and distribution practices have become highly computerized.
In terms of technology, "supermarkets are so far ahead of the
rest of retailing it's frightening," says Mary McAboy, head
of industrial relations at Von's. That trend is pushing more
of gross profits to the bottom line. Thus, any
recession-induced damage may be small.
   But because supermarkets' net income is only about 1% of
sales, small changes in operations have a way of looking
large. And high multiples give the industry little room for
faltering.
   Oppenheimer's Mr. Comeau says Albertson's, growing at 20%
to 25% a year, could slip in a down economy "to the 13% to
15% level." There is no complaint here with 15% growth. But
with Albertson's -- to cite an example -- trading at 20 times
the past 12 months' earnings, the Street is expecting growth
to be superlative. In terms of its stock price, merely solid
growth mightn't be enough.
   ---
   Country fund fever has turned out to be a killer. But it
may be creating some healthy buying opportunities.
   Late last year, frenzied buying shoved up the stocks of
publicly traded funds that invest in Austria, Germany,
Malaysia, Thailand and elsewhere. Buyers of fund shares, who
often paid $1.50 to buy a portfolio of stocks worth $1, now
are sitting on sickening losses.
   Nowhere have the losses been bigger than at Spain Fund,
which provoked the most extreme buying binge. Heavy Japanese
purchases at one point propelled the fund's stock to trade at
2.4 times the value of the fund's portfolio. But Spain Fund,
once quoted at 39, dropped yesterday to 10 7/8, a 52-week
low, before closing at 11. The fund's shares now are at a 14%
discount to the fund's $12.74 per-share portfolio value.
   For today's bottom fishers, country funds are "down to
realistic levels," says Richard Barone, chairman of
Cleveland's Maxus Investment Group. "They're now good buys
for the long-term investor."

   Cie. de Saint-Gobain said it applied for regulatory
approval to raise its holdings in the West German glass group
Oberland Glas AG above 50%, from the current level of 35%.
   A spokesman for the French glass and building-materials
group said, however, that the move is preliminary at this
stage and might not lead to an actual increase in its stake
until 1991 or 1992.

   Saint-Gobain acquired its stake in Oberland in 1988
through a share swap with the Wiegand family, which retains a
25% interest. The French company has first refusal rights on
that 25% block, and would need prior regulatory approval
before it could exercise them.
   Oberland couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

   NEW YORK -- Blackstone Group, the investment banking
boutique, joined forces with a French investment bank,
Financiere Indosuez, to advise on mergers between companies
in the U.S., France and Belgium.
   Blackstone and the French concern said each would make an
equity investment of undisclosed size in the other. The new
venture, Blackstone Indosuez, is aimed at the burgeoning area
of cross-border mergers in Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Financiere Indosuez has already invested $25 million in
Blackstone's merchant banking fund, and yesterday Blackstone
said it also plans, along with some of its existing
investors, to invest up to $50 million in a merchant banking
fund set up by Compagnie de Suez, the French parent of
Financiere Indosuez.
   The Suez group, an industrial and financial holding
company, controls Societe Generale de Belgique, based in
Brussels, Belgium.
   Roger Altman, vice chairman of Blackstone, said the two
firms have been working together informally for two years.
"One of the reasons we're confident that this joint venture
will be successful is that we lived together for a couple of
years before getting married," Mr. Altman said. Blackstone
already has alliances with other firms in Japan, Britain, and
Canada.
   As part of the alliance, four Financiere Indosuez
employees will move from their existing offices here to
Blackstone's office. In turn, three Blackstone employees here
will transfer to Financiere Indosuez in Paris.

   Johnstone Named
   To Senior Fidelity

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
SECURITIES (SCR)
</IN>
<LP>
   BOSTON -- Fidelity Investments, underscoring its push into
overseas markets, named successful money manager C. Bruce
Johnstone chief investment officer and a managing director of
its Fidelity International Ltd. affiliate.
   Mr. Johnstone, 49 years old, the best-known money manager
at Fidelity after the recent departure of Peter Lynch, since
1972 has managed the $4.1 billion Fidelity Equity-Income
Fund, the third-largest of Fidelity's more than 100 equity
funds. The fund has been a top performer long term, but it
has had a weaker performance in recent years as "value
investing" in high-yield stocks, Mr. Johnstone's forte, has
fallen out of favor generally.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Johnstone's appointment is "a very aggressive move
showing they're taking {international markets} very
seriously. It should put the rest of the industry on notice
that there's going to be a big push with resources behind it
to make it work," said D. Tyler Jenks, vice president and
research director at Kanon Bloch Carre &amp; Co., which tracks
mutual funds.
   Mr. Johnstone will be based in London and will oversee
portfolio management operations in Europe, Asia and
Australia, which oversee about $11 billion in mutual funds,
unit trusts and institutional accounts for overseas
investors. Fidelity manages $117 billion of assets in the
U.S.
   "Bruce Johnstone's appointment is a key strategic move,
reflecting our belief that investment success in the 1990s
will depend on how well investors exploit the entire world of
investment choices," said Edward C. Johnson 3rd, chairman and
chief executive officer of Fidelity.
   Mr. Johnstone said he asked Mr. Johnson for a new job
because he wanted to try something different. "After you
manage money for 19 years, it's not as much of a novel or
learning experience as it was in the beginning. The variety
isn't quite the same." In his new position, he won't manage
investments, but develop management talent and "create the
kind of environment overseas that we have here."
   Fidelity said that from Dec. 31, 1971, to Aug. 31 of this
year, the Equity-Income fund under Mr. Johnstone had a return
of 1,108.87% vs. 596.11% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. This
performance ranks it 18th among the 229 funds in Lipper
Analytical Services' "general equity" fund category during
the period.
   More recently, Mr. Johnstone's fund hasn't fared as well.
Eric Kobren, a newsletter publisher who tracks Fidelity, said
the Equity-Income Fund is down 13.4% year to date, slightly
worse than the S&amp;P 500 drop of about 10%. Last year, the fund
rose 18.7%, well below the S&amp;P's increase of 31.7%. He said
Fidelity is starting a second Equity-Income fund because it
is hard to attract investors by advertising the performance
of the existing one.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Industrials Gain 3.96 on Decline
   In Interest Rates, Lower Oil Prices

   NEW YORK -- Falling interest rates and slightly lower oil
prices helped stocks break a daylong slump to edge higher.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 3.96 to
2571.29, the second advance this week and the first
back-to-back gain since late August. Even so, 854 issues
declined on the New York Stock Exchange while only 626
advanced.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Big Board volume of 141,130,000 shares was the highest
since Aug. 27, when the Dow Jones industrials rallied 78.71
points on volume of 160,150,000 shares.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
went up 0.83 to 318.60, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index gained 0.26 to 174.88 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index rose 0.68 to 295.08.
   Stock-index arbitrage buy programs, in which traders dart
between stocks, stock-index futures and options to profit
from fleeting price differences, contributed to a late surge
in volume and share prices. Program traders were active in
futures contracts on both the S&amp;P 500 index and the Chicago
Board of Trade's Major Market Index, dealers said.
   A big decline in Primerica helped keep the industrial
average down for much of the session, despite gains in
International Business Machines.
   But a jump in Treasury bond prices and a weaker crude-oil
market helped stocks climb out of an earlier loss of more
than 34 points. Crude oil for October delivery fell 22 cents
a barrel to $33.41. Long-term Treasury bonds recovered losses
to finish about unchanged to yield 9.06%.
   Traders said institutions showed a greater desire to buy
and sell, compared to recent sessions. Some 3,102 blocks of
10,000 shares or more traded on the Big Board yesterday,
compared with 2,502 the day before.
   But the pickup wasn't enough to convince many observers
that the market would soon break out of recent doldrums. "One
can definitely note a lack of enthusiasm," said Trude
Latimer, a market strategist at Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co.
   Daniel Williams, head trader at Dillon Read, said, "It was
another one of those wait-and-see type of days."
   Disappointment with reports on August consumer prices and
the July trade deficit weighed on the market as the session
began, traders said. Although the 0.8% jump in last month's
consumer price index was in line with forecasts, prices
excluding food and energy went up 0.5%, heightening inflation
worries. And the trade deficit of $9.33 billion for July was
wider than expected.
   Stocks skidded to session lows as rumors swept through the
market that Chase Manhattan was having difficulty placing
commercial paper, a form of short-term financing. Chase
denied the rumors, but its stock fell 7/8 to 15 in trading of
1.6 million shares.
   But in the afternoon, a sharp decline in the federal funds
rate -- the lending rate banks charge each other on loans of
their reserves -- sparked speculation that the Federal
Reserve might have eased monetary policy. Federal funds
traded as low as 6.25%, well below their recent 8% level.
   "The market seemed to latch onto the Fed stories," said
Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical research at A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. As Treasury securities recovered
early losses, the rebound "took the stock market up with it,"
he said.
   Optimism about a possible agreement to reduce the federal
budget deficit also lifted the market, traders said. Late in
the session, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt said the
budget talks are moving into "a new stage" as congressional
leaders try to reach a compromise on whether to cut the
capital-gains tax.
   Federal National Mortgage Association, the most active Big
Board issue, tumbled 1 1/2 to 27 1/2 on 2.3 million shares
after its chairman and chief executive officer, David
Maxwell, said he will retire Jan. 31. Mr. Maxwell said Fannie
Mae faces a "great challenge" as the result of "a very
tumultuous time in the economy," which is likely to bring
changes in the U.S. financial system.
   Salomon jumped 1 to 25 7/8 on 748,100 shares, about double
its normal volume, following a positive story by Cable News
Network. Salomon, whose Phibro Energy unit refines and trades
oil, has benefited for weeks from surging oil prices. James
Hanbury, a Wertheim Schroder analyst, says Salomon stock
could hit 30 within six months; he says investors have
"undervalued" the firm's oil refineries.
   Primerica tumbled 2 5/8 to 23 1/8 on 1.5 million shares.
Industry observers attributed the decline to concerns about
the company's consumer finance operations and recent reports
that New Jersey insurance regulators are seeking to stop its
Transport Life unit from doing business in the state.
   International Business Machines climbed 2 1/8 to 107 1/4
as 1.7 million shares changed hands. Among other blue-chip
consumer stocks, Coca-Cola rose 3/4 to 41 1/4, Procter &amp;
Gamble added 3/4 to 76 3/8, McDonald's rose 1/2 to 26 7/8 and
Philip Morris added 1/4 to 45 1/8 on 2.3 million shares.
   UAL soared 7 5/8 to 105. A group of unions at its United
Airlines unit will meet with banks this week to discuss a
new, reduced buy-out offer of $175 to $180 a share, which
will likely involve participation of an unnamed foreign
airline.
   Motorola dipped 1 1/2 to 61 3/4. Analysts at PaineWebber
and Prudential-Bache Securities lowered their 1990 earnings
projections on the company, and PaineWebber also reduced its
1991 estimate.
   Unisys dropped 5/8 to 7 1/4 and traded as low as 6 3/4, a
new 52-week low, amid renewed speculation that the company's
dividend may be in jeopardy. Its board has a dividend meeting
scheduled for next week.
   Vista Chemical tumbled 2 1/8 to 25 1/4. Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
analyst Charles Rose said the company is facing cash-flow
problems which will put its dividend in question.
   Itel dropped 7/8 to 14 3/8. The company completed a
repurchase of 4.7 million common shares from Henley Group
under the terms of a previously reached agreement.
   Abbott Laboratories rose 1 1/4 to 41 5/8. Cowen &amp; Co.
repeated its buy recommendation on the stock, citing Abbott's
selection of Thomas R. Hodgson as president and chief
operating officer.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.02
to 319.69. Volume totaled 10,890,000 shares.
   Mission Resource Partners skidded 1 7/8 to 8 1/4. The
partnership said it is holding talks with an independent oil
and gas company for the sale of all of its remaining assets,
which would result in the dissolution of the partnership.

   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
that Stotler &amp; Co., a now-closed Chicago futures firm,
settled SEC charges of securities law violations in
connection with its government-securities business.
   Without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, Stotler
agreed to have its registration as a government-securities
brokerage firm revoked. The charges stem from Aug. 21, when
the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission brought
action against the firm. Stotler settled the CFTC charges but
hadn't resolved the SEC matter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stotler is the futures-brokerage arm of Stotler Group
Inc., which was partly owned by former Chicago Board of Trade
Chairman Karsten Mahlmann. Mr. Mahlmann resigned his CBOT
post after another Stotler unit was charged by the CFTC with
making loans with customer funds from commodity pools.
   The SEC alleged that Stotler &amp; Co. failed to maintain
sufficient capital, failed to file documents and kept
outdated and improper records of capital levels and of
positions in the government-securities markets. The complaint
also charged that Stotler didn't notify the SEC that its net
capital was below the required minimum.
   Stotler Group filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in
federal bankruptcy court late last month.
   In Chicago, attorneys for Stotler &amp; Co. weren't available
for comment.

   TORONTO -- The Canadian subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.
presented a new contract proposal offering more money in a
bid to end a four-day-old strike by about 13,000 unionized
employees.
   While calling the company's latest package a "serious"
offer, Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers
union, said the proposal still fell short of many of the the
union's minimum demands in important areas such as wages,
additional holiday time, job security and fringe benefits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The union leader appeared to back away from his earlier
threats to abandon the bargaining table, and he said
negotiations would continue in an effort to reach a contract
settlement.
   Ford has "obviously rejected a number of our bottom-line
proposals. We'll have to see if we can do anything about that
in the next couple of days," Mr. White said.
   Donald McKenzie, Ford Canada's chief negotiator, said the
company's latest offer was a "significant improvement" over
its first proposal made last week, which was swiftly rejected
by the union. The CAW has made clear it didn't dispute the
"direction" of the offer, but rather the amount of money put
on the table.
   "My sense is {the new offer} will move things forward
rapidly," Mr. McKenzie said. He wouldn't provide details of
the latest package.
   The strike by Ford Canada employees has shut nine of
Ford's plants in Canada and threatened to hobble operations
at some key Ford plants in the U.S.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues went down 480.78
points, or 1.97%, to 23884.82.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index fell another 68.36
points to close the morning session at 23816.46.
   Investor participation on Tuesday was lackluster as
growing concern about higher domestic interest rates and
continuing uncertainty about the Mideast situation dried up
buying interest, traders said.
   Trading was volatile as the thin overall volume permitted
even a small number of sell orders and arbitrage selling to
push down the Nikkei Index, traders said.
   The index plunged as low as 23308 points early in the
afternoon, before bouncing up on a small amount of buying.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million
shares, up from 306 million shares Monday. Decliners
outnumbered gainers 894 to 85, while 92 others were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 43.86 points, or 2.36%, to 1816.33.
   The second section index dropped 69.16 points, or 1.95%,
to 3474.99. Volume was estimated at 6.5 million shares, up
from 5.1 million shares Monday.
   "Trading both on cash and futures markets was interest
rate-driven," said a trader at J.P. Morgan Securities.
   "The market is gradually discounting another discount rate
increase," said a trader at Dai-Ichi Securities.
   A report by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun in its Tuesday
morning editions that the long-term prime rate will be raised
for the third consecutive month in October fueled
expectations that domestic interest rates will go higher,
traders said. Such expectations were also prompted by another
upswing in oil prices, the traders said.
   Also, rumors that securities houses and institutional
investors will sell Japanese government bonds heavily
Wednesday, resulting in higher yields, damped sentiment in
the stock market Tuesday afternoon, traders said.
   Widespread perceptions that domestic interest rates
haven't yet peaked further discouraged buying by
institutional investors, who have been slowing trade activity
ahead of the fiscal midyear book closing at the end of
September, traders said.
   Observers attributed Tuesday's decline to the lack of
buying, which they said made the market unable to absorb even
a small amount of sell orders.
   "Stocks are priced abnormally low," said Kazuhiko Hama,
general manager of stock trading at Nomura Securities. "It's
largely because of the seasonal factor," he added, predicting
that the worst will be over with the disappearance of
term-end factors.
   A trader at Yamaichi Securities said some institutions are
ready to start bargain hunting next week because trading
after Tuesday will be recorded as October transactions.
   Because stocks have fallen on a small amount of selling, a
rebound may not require a large amount of buying, the trader
said.
   Mitsuhiro Nakano, an analyst with Daiwa Securities,
warned, however, that as long as the bond market remains
unstable, institutions are unlikely to start buying actively.
   Kobe Steel fell 13 yen to 516 yen (9.5 cents to $3.78),
while Nippon Steel dropped 15 yen to 456 yen. Kansai Electric
Power declined 140 yen to 2420 yen, and Tokyo Electric Power
was down 140 yen at 3040 yen.
   Among financial shares, Mitsubishi Bank dropped 50 yen to
1780 yen, while Nomura Securities plummeted 20 yen to 1620
yen.
   Blue-chip shares in the electronics and automobile sectors
also ended lower, with Sony down 170 yen at 6690 yen and
Toyota Motor falling 10 yen to 1890 yen.
   Meanwhile, Tokyo Steel gained 60 yen to 3960 yen,
reflecting speculation that the company may increase
dividends for the current fiscal year.
   In London, traders said the disclosure of U.S. economic
indicators was hurting that market. Among them, the U.S. July
trade deficit grew to $9.3 billion from $5.3 billion in June,
and the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.8% in August.
   As the London market fell through a key support level,
traders expected the market to fall lower still in search of
a new level. Wall Street drifted lower during London
afternoon trading, and traders were not optimistic for a
quick recovery.
   Scattered buying was evident, but institutions continued
to stay away from any large holding positions, traders said.
What buying was done amounted to "topping up funds
discreetly, not to support levels but to get cheap stock,"
one trader said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index fell
30.3 points to 2064, falling to the lowest close since April
24, 1989, when the index settled at 2062.
   The Financial Times 30-Share Index ended down 29.3 points
at 1576.8. Volume was 379.2 million shares, well above
Monday's 286.6 million shares.
   Among several companies reporting interim results,
property and construction concern Taylor Woodrow, said
half-year pretax profit fell 12% to #38 million ($72.8
million) as high interest rates weakened earnings. The shares
fell a penny to 200 pence, as traders were relieved that the
company's results matched expectations.
   Stores and property management company Kingfisher also
matched expectations with a 24% slump in pretax profit
following a sharp decline in property operations. The shares
gained 11 pence to 318 pence.
   Bermuda-based security services and auctions concern ADT
recorded a 38% rise in pretax profit for the half-year, at
the bottom of expectations, and offered a bonus share to
investors. ADT fell 5 pence to 148 pence.
   On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, investors were still
expecting Continental AG to reject Pirelli's takeover bid
outright or arrange a watered-down compromise. This would
deprive the stock of the takeover speculation that has buoyed
Continental shares in recent months. Continental plunged 5.5%
to 250.50 marks ($161.87), after a 7.1% decline Monday.
   In Milan, Pirelli fell 10 lire to 1775 lire ($1.53) and
slumped to 1745 lire in the after market.
   Meanwhile, shares closed lower on all major European
markets. South African gold stocks closed lower. Stocks also
closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei, Manila, Singapore
and Wellington, but rose in Seoul.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   NEW YORK -- The bond market was rampant with rumors
yesterday as traders and investors tried to explain why the
federal funds rate suddenly plunged.
   The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other
for overnight loans and is often used by the Federal Reserve
to signal changes in monetary policy. The rate has hovered
around 8% for months, but yesterday fell as low as 6 1/4%. On
Monday the rate closed at 1%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many analysts said yesterday's decline doesn't signal that
the Fed is reducing short-term interest rates, but instead
reflects technical factors. Specifically, analysts said that
the falling federal funds rate is a sign that major
commercial banks are flush with cash and don't need to borrow
short-term funds as they approach the end of a two-week
settlement period.
   In recent months, the federal funds rate has risen sharply
near the end of a settlement period as banks scrambled to
meet their reserve requirements by borrowing heavily.
   "The banks have more reserves than they need," said Kevin
Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. He said the banks borrowed earlier in the period in an
effort to avoid being squeezed again as they have been in the
past.
   But there were rumors that the decline in the federal
funds rate reflects the inability of one or more big New York
banks to borrow in the fed markets as a result of perceptions
that banks are having credit problems. According to these
traders, some big New York banks are expected to borrow
needed funds at the Fed's discount window instead of through
the market.
   "There was suddenly just no demand for federal funds,"
said one fed funds trader in New York. "It happened so
quickly. We may find out in a few days that something went
wrong, either a wire transfer problem or a major borrower was
pushed out of the market or maybe something else," he said.
   In trading, bond prices ended little changed after a day
of seesaw trading. Bonds fell nearly 1/2 point, about $5 for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount, in early trading after the
government reported that the consumer price index rose 0.8%
in August. The CPI, a measure of inflation, "knocked the
market lower, and that set the tone for a lousy day," said
Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank.
   A sharply higher trade deficit also hurt market sentiment.
The Commerce Department reported that the import-export gap
widened to a seasonally adjusted $9.33 billion in July from a
revised $5.34 billion in June.
   In addition, traders said that a power outage at the
Chicago Board of Trade suspended dealings in the Treasury
bond futures pits and may have exacerbated the early losses.
   The bond market retraced the losses when the federal funds
declined as dealers rushed to cover short-sale positions.
These dealers had sold borrowed securities earlier this week
in hopes that yesterday's inflation report would push prices
lower and they could buy back the securities at a lower price
and pocket the difference. After prices dropped sharply early
yesterday, dealers saw the softening federal funds rate as an
opportunity to close out their positions and take profits.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   It was a busy day in the tax-exempt market as more than
$900 million of new securities were offered.
   But the avalanche of supply appeared to overwhelm demand
and pushed prices of tax-exempt issues as much as 1/4 point
lower.
   Traders said that while retail buyers have been supporting
many of the new issues, institutional investors have been
reluctant to purchase securities in the primary market and
instead are scooping up bargains in the secondary market.
   "They can sit back and buy {bonds} cheaper," on the
secondary market, said one trader. "They don't see any
upside" to the market, he said.
   Weaker than expected demand forced underwriters at Dillon
Read &amp; Co. to reprice and restructure a $200 million
Connecticut general obligation bond issue.
   The repricing raised some yields by 10 basis points,
eliminated serial bonds due in 2007 and 2009 and created a
term bond due in 2010. Under the restructured terms, the
bonds were priced to yield between 6% for notes due in 1991
to 7.25% for bonds due in 2010.
   Among other new issues, New York State Dormitory Authority
offered $314 million City University system consolidated
second general resolution revenue bonds. The securities were
priced to yield between 6.40% for notes due in 1992 to 8.05%
for bonds due in 2017.
   Chase Securities Inc., a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp.,
was in the process of pricing $110 million of Vermont Housing
Finance Authority bonds. Pricing details weren't completed by
the end of the day.
   Ahead on the calendar, the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey will sell $100 million consolidated notes via
competitive bid at 11 a.m. EDT today.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Rumors that Chase Manhattan Corp. was having problems
selling its commercial paper, shook the banking sector,
pushing up yields of many financial issues.
   Although Chase denied it was having difficulty placing the
short-term corporate IOUs, yields on its bonds rose.
   Corporate bond traders said Chase Manhattan's 10%
subordinated notes, maturing in 1999, were yielding 13.40%
yesterday, about 30 basis points wider than Monday.
   Chase Manhattan bonds had tightened about 20 basis points
last week after the company reset the rate on $200 million of
subordinated notes at more than 13%. The bonds, however,
returned to their existing levels yesterday as a result of
continuing concerns about the bank's financial well-being,
traders said.
   Those concerns as well as worries about the banking
industry in general depressed bonds of other financial
institutions.
   Chemical Banking Corp.'s 9.75% subordinated capital notes,
due in 1999, were yielding 14.125%, about 20 basis points
wider than Monday.
   In the broader corporate bond market, prices of high-grade
corporate issues were barely changed while junk bonds, or
high-risk, high-yield bonds, ended lower.
   The junk bonds of Carter Hawley Hale Stores continued to
plunge. Like many retailers, Carter Hawley has been hurt by
reports that consumer spending is expected to be light this
Christmas.
   Carter Hawley's 12 1/4% securities fell 6 3/4 points to 62
on the New York Stock Exchange while the company's 12.5%
securities fell six points to 52.
   AmBase Corp.'s junk bonds, which had been trading in the
mid-90s a month ago, plunged 10 points to 40. Market
participants said that they knew of no news developments that
would account for the sharp decline.
   But junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. rose even as the
broader high-yield market posted losses of between 1/4 to 3/8
point. Most notably, RJR's 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind
debentures surged 1 3/8 point to 89 1/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange.The 17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due
in 2009, rose 7/8 to 112 7/8.
   A spokesman for RJR Nabisco declined to comment on the
rise in either issue.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasurys ended unchanged after a day of seesaw trading.
   The benchmark 30-year bond finished at a price of 96 23/32
to yield 9.06%, the same level as Monday. Two-year notes
ended unchanged at a price of 100 5/32 to yield 8.02%.
   Treasury bill rates also were unchanged at Monday's
levels, with the discount rate on three-month bills ending at
7.38% and the rate on six-month bills ending at 7.29%.
   Today, the focus of the market will likely turn to Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who is scheduled to present the
central bank's economic outlook to Congress.
   Investors and dealers will be listening closely for any
indication that the Fed is moving toward easing monetary
policy. Mr. Greenspan will begin speaking at 10 a.m. EDT.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities ended unchanged to slightly
lower after recouping most of their losses posted yesterday
morning on news of a rise in the core rate of consumer price
inflation.
   In the secondary mortgage market, Government National
Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue for October delivery fell
1/32 at 98 3/8, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2%
Gold participation certificates were unchanged at 98 7/8, and
Federal National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% securities
were flat at 98 21/32.
   The mortgage-backed securities market showed little
response to the continuing sales from Resolution Trust Corp.
The thrift bailout agency reportedly sold more than $100
million of seasoned Ginnie Maes yesterday after unloading
nearly $200 million of seasoned Ginnie Maes and other
securities Monday.
   In the primary market, a $330 million issue of Freddie Mac
Remic mortgage securities, collateralized with Freddie Mac 9%
securities, was priced by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
   Also, a $75 million Alaska Housing Finance Corp.
collateralized mortgage obligation issue was offered by First
Boston Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government bond market managed to end firmer
despite continued bearish factors. Traders said the
last-minute rise in Japanese bond prices reflected short-sale
covering.
   In a short sale, dealers and professional traders sell
borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by
replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities.
Essentially, these dealers are betting that prices will fall.
   Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond ended at 81.22, up
0.05 points, to yield 8.55%. (When calculated using the
semiannual compound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at
7.79%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   Traders, however, said widespread bearish sentiment
remains as key interest rates continue to rise. The yield on
Euroyen interest rates futures contracts ended at 8.82%
yesterday, up from 8.78% the day before. The long-term prime
rate is expected to be boosted for the third month in a row,
to almost 9% for October from 8.5% for September.

   PARIS -- French Industry Minister Roger Fauroux urged
troubled state-owned computer maker Cie. des Machines Bull to
negotiate a partnership with West Germany's Siemens AG or
Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. so it could compete in world
markets.
   As part of a recent agreement to acquire the computer
operations of Honeywell Inc. of the U.S., Bull already has a
cooperation agreement with Japan's NEC Corp. But Mr. Fauroux
said in an interview with the newspaper Les Echos that the
government prefers that the partner be European rather than
American or Japanese.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bull, whose losses in this year's first half tripled to
1.88 billion francs ($361.5 million) from last year's first
half, declined comment. The industry minister said the
government would consider authorizing Bull to swap shares
with a European partner, as state-owned auto maker Renault
S.A. did with Sweden's AB Volvo, in effect partially
privatizing Bull. Another option, Mr. Fauroux said, would be
for Bull to set up joint subsidiaries with a European
partner.

   NEW YORK -- The average interest rate rose to 7.98% at
Citicorp's $50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial
paper, or corporate IOUs, from 7.9397% at last week's sale.
   Bids totaling $405 million were submitted. Accepted bids
were at 7.98%.

<TEXT>
   Citicorp also said the average rate rose to 7.928% at its
$50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 7.924%
at last week's sale. Bids totaling $375 million were
submitted. Accepted bids were at 7.928%.
   Earlier this month, Citicorp said this would be the last
such auction of commercial paper. Growth in consumer
deposits, the bank's balance-sheet management and its direct
placement of commercial paper have eliminated the need for
the auctions, Citicorp said.

   France's Groupe Strafor S.A. plans to acquire Facom S.A.
through a stock swap valued at 2.06 billion francs ($397
million).
   The companies said they will ask their boards next week to
approve the exchange of 13 Strafor shares for every 10 Facom
shares. Strafor shares closed yesterday at 1,015 francs, down
25 francs from when trading was suspended Monday for the
announcement. Facom shares declined 80 francs to 1,290
francs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 2.06 billion franc valuation is based on the new value
of Strafor shares and the fact that about 1.56 million Facom
shares are outstanding.
   The move will establish Strafor as the holding company for
the group, with control of almost all of Facom's shares.
Facom will be set up as a separate operating unit.
   The groups said they will have about 15,000 employees when
the merger is completed.
   Facom, which claims to be the European leader in the hand
tools market and third world-wide, had consolidated net
profit of 141 million francs in 1989 after payments to
minority interests. Revenue totaled 1.89 billion francs.
   Strafor, which is active mainly in the areas of office
furniture and metals, generated consolidated net profit of
165 million francs after payments to minority interests last
year on revenue of 5.4 billion francs.

   Campeau Corp.'s two retailing units, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., reported a total loss of
$126.3 million for the 13 weeks ended Aug. 4, a somewhat
better performance than a year earlier.
   At the same time, the two companies -- both of which filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection on Jan. 15 --
reported that their total revenue for the period decreased
slightly. Most retailers experienced sluggish sales during
the summer months, leading many Wall Street analysts to
speculate that the fall and Christmas selling periods will be
more difficult than earlier anticipated.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Federated reported a loss of $80 million for the quarter
ended Aug. 4 compared with a $78.9 million loss in the same
period a year earlier. Allied suffered a $46.3 million loss
compared with a $56.2 million loss in the same period a year
earlier.
   Revenue at Federated decreased 3.5% to $983.8 million for
the quarter compared with $1.02 billion in the same quarter a
year earlier. Revenue at Allied decreased 7.8% to $540.9
million compared with $586.8 million last year.
   A spokesman for Federated and Allied also noted that the
cash flow from continuing operations was stronger than
expected for both companies.

   Bertelsmann AG said it sold 49% of its book club in Italy
to publishers Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera Editori. Terms of
the transaction weren't disclosed.
   The West German publishing company said it could expand
the market share for Euroclubs Italia through Rizzoli's
influence in Italy.

   Bertelsmann, one of the world's largest operators of book
clubs, said its Euroclubs Italia book club had 700,000
members in 1989 with sales of 75 million German marks ($48.5
million). Walter Gerstgrasser, Bertelsmann managing board
member, said the company will retain 51% of the book club as
well as its current management.
   Last year, Rizzoli had the equivalent of 3 billion marks
in sales and controls about one-fourth of the Italian book
market, according to Bertelsmann.
   A spokesman for Bertelsmann said the company has had "good
experience" with partnerships established with other book
clubs in France and Britain.

   Itel Corp. repurchased 4,675,000 of its shares from Henley

Henley said it now holds 14 million Itel shares, or 33% of

   In August, Itel, a leasing company, agreed to buy 25%, or

   Itel also agreed to buy another 4,675,000 shares held by
Henley before the end of the year for about $91 million, or
$19.50 a share.
   Itel has an option to buy the remaining 9,350,000 shares
that Henley owns at $21 a share if it makes the purchase by
March 31, 1991, or at $22 a share if it buys the stake by
July 31, 1991. If Itel doesn't exercise the option, it must
underwrite the sale of the 9,350,000 shares at $22 a share,
or $206 million, according to the pact.
   On Monday, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded its rating
on more than $1 billion of Itel debt, citing the increased
leverage prompted by Itel's agreement to buy back shares from
Henley. S&amp;P said the buy-back, which is being financed
through asset sales, will increase debt leverage during an

schedule.

salaried. The company said it will provide those employees
with severance and outplacement benefits.
   Ralston called the closing an "economic necessity." The
company said that it is facing "more production capacity than
needed," citing increased plant efficiency.
   Ralston said production from the Mechanicsburg plant,
which makes dry cat and dog food, will shift to other pet
food plants. The company said it has seven other pet food

   EPA Says 9 Companies Agreed to Slash
   Toxic-Chemical Emissions at 40 Plants

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency said
nine major companies have agreed to substantially reduce
emissions of toxic chemicals at 40 plants in 14 states.
   At a briefing, EPA chief William Reilly also announced
that the agency is issuing a new guidebook on asbestos that
emphasizes that removal isn't necessarily the best way to
reduce potential exposure to the substance. In addition, he
said he is pleased with the progress made recently by House
and Senate conferees that are reconciling their differing
clean-air bills.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Reilly said the emissions cuts, which will be
completed in December 1993, would reduce overall toxic air
emissions from these facilities by almost 83%, or 9,460,000
pounds, annually. "This is an extraordinary voluntary effort,
demonstrating that EPA and industry can work cooperatively to
address environmental problems," Mr. Reilly said.
   The nine companies are BASF Corp.; Dow Chemical Co.; Exxon
Corp.; General Electric Co.; Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.;
Occidental Petroleum Corp.; Reichhold Chemicals Inc., a
subsidiary of DIC Americas Inc.; Texaco Inc. and Texas
Petrochemicals Corp. Some of the plants could get credit for
reductions that would be required under proposals pending in
the clean-air conference.
   The largest cut from a single plant would come from a GE
plant in Mt. Vernon, Ind., which is scheduled to cut
emissions of methylene chloride, which the EPA lists as a
probable human carcinogen, by 6,113,390 pounds a year. A
Texaco facility in Port Neches, Texas, is scheduled to reduce
emissions of butadiene, a probable human carcinogen, by
1,199,230 pounds a year.
   The agreement grew out of an August 1989 meeting when Mr.
Reilly sought commitments from senior officers of these nine
companies and the Chemical Manufacturers Association. The 40
plants are on a list of 182 facilities the agency has
identified as having high estimated risks from toxic air
emissions. As part of the agreement, the companies will
submit annual reports describing their progress.
   On asbestos, the EPA said the substance is a health hazard
only when its fibers are breathed into the lungs. But if
asbestos isn't airborne and isn't releasing fibers, it should
be maintained until buildings are renovated or demolished,
the agency said.
   The EPA insists that its new guidebook represents a
renewed emphasis rather than a change in policy. Many school
officials and building owners, however, have believed that
the EPA has been encouraging costly asbestos removal.
   A Goodyear spokesman said the company has already achieved
a 61% reduction in emissions of butadiene at four of its
plants since December 1988 and expects further reductions by
January 1991.
   "We agree emission reductions must be a top priority and
in 1987 we committed to reduce emissions by 75% over a
five-year period," said Joe Murphy, human resources manager
at the GE plastics' site in Mount Vernon, Ind. Mr. Murphy
added that GE is planning a "long-term process change" that
will eliminate more than 80% of the methylene chloride
emissions at the site by 1993.

   Anticipating increases in nonperforming loans and
securities losses, NewMil Bancorp of New Milford, Conn.,
parent of New Milford Savings Bank, said its board voted an
addition of about $700,000 to the loan-loss reserve,
equivalent to its expected earnings for its first quarter
ending Sept. 30.
   The board also suspended the regular quarterly dividend of
15 cents a share for "the foreseeable future."

   The move will increase NewMil Bancorp's total loan-loss
reserve to $2 million. New Milford Savings Bank operates 12
banking offices in northwestern Connecticut. NewMil Bancorp
had fiscal 1990 earnings of $3.8 million.
   The company said its decision was in response to a
regulatory opinion that its reserve was inadequate against
nonperforming loans, which include foreclosed loans and loans
for which interest payments are 90 days past due. In
addition, substantial losses are expected as the value of the
company's stock portfolio depreciates.

   The diaper wars have entered a new phase.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. is launching Pampers Phases, a
disposable with different absorbency and design features for
the four stages of a child's early years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For instance, the diaper for "crawlers" has wider tape
fasteners because babies old enough to crawl put more stress
on the tapes. The infant size has a longer back sheet,
because at that age, they spend more time lying down.
   While P&amp;G's two brands, Pampers and Luvs, have a combined
market share of about 51%, rival Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s
Huggies is the leading brand with 34% of the market. Pampers
is second with 27%, and Luvs is third with 24%.
   P&amp;G has been continually upgrading Pampers, which was the
leading brand with a hefty 59% of the market a decade ago.
"It's two brands against one, but in their heart of hearts,
they'd love to have Pampers number one again," says Hugh
Zurkuhlen of Salomon Brothers.
   It's too soon to say if the new Phases will do the trick.
Some analysts note that P&amp;G has simply given new names to
familiar "small," "medium" and "large" sizes. "It depends on
how you position it. If you just put it out there, no one
will notice," says Mr. Zurkuhlen.

SGB's other main units are also expected to report lower

of Deeway Servais &amp; Cie, a Belgian brokerage firm. "They've
got some interesting projects, and I think their management
is doing a good job."

   Dismissal of Antitrust Suit

   Pan American Satellite is expected to appeal a federal
court decision to dismiss the company's $1.5 billion
antitrust suit against Communications Satellite Corp.
   The decision in federal court in Manhattan was on the
ground that Comsat has immunity from such lawsuits. PanAmSat,
a satellite operator based in Greenwich, Conn., filed the
suit in July 1989, alleging attempts by Comsat to limit
competition in the market for satellite transmissions. The
court said that agreements between the federal government and
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization
(Intelsat) as well as the International Organizations
Immunities Act gave Comsat, as the U.S. signatory to
Intelsat, immunity from antitrust suits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "My sense is that we will appeal," said Frederick Landman,
president of PanAmSat. He said that company lawyers were
examining the Friday decision. "We think the court gave an
incorrect reading" of the antitrust immunity issue, Mr.
Landman said.
   Comsat, based in Washington, D.C., welcomed the decision,
and reiterated its view that the lawsuit was groundless and
ironic because Comsat had urged other Intelsat members to
approve PanAmSat's operations.

   House Votes to Cut
   Spending for SDI
   To $2.3 Billion

   WASHINGTON -- The House voted to reduce spending for the
Strategic Defense Initiative to $2.3 billion in fiscal 1991
-- the lowest level in more than five years and nearly half
of the Bush administration's request for the ambitious
program.
   The 225-189 roll call reflected a concerted effort by the
Democratic leadership and underscored the continued
vulnerability of major strategic weapons despite the current
crisis in the Mideast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Iraqi threat was invoked by both sides in the debate
to bolster their opposing arguments, and a large portion of
the SDI savings is expected to be reallocated to meet
conventional-force needs in the Persian Gulf operation. An
amendment being crafted by House Armed Services Committee
Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) would add back an estimated $1
billion elsewhere in the bill, including funds for
anti-chemical weapons equipment, fast sealift capability, and
hospital and ammunition supply ships.
   Although the final margin last night was narrower and more
partisan than a comparable vote last year, the cut is
significantly deeper. The $2.3 billion level is less than the
House approved as early as fiscal 1986, and represents a
nearly 40% cut from the $3.8 billion authorization for the
current fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   Critics argued that the reduced level condemns the program
to research forever, and the Senate, which has approved $3.7
billion for SDI next year, is certain to demand a higher
figure. In this context, the vote was directed at buying some
leverage in the coming negotiations between the two chambers.
But even if the House moves more than halfway toward the
Senate, the final cut would be the deepest yet sustained by
the program.
   The administration's own SDI budget was implicitly
rejected by a 338-83 margin. As much as conservatives cited
the threat of Iraqi arms, opponents countered that the
Pentagon had failed to give sufficient priority to the
relatively small portion of the program devoted to developing
systems that intercept low-flying missiles such as the Scud
used by Iraq.
   Within SDI, an estimated $125 million is allocated this
year for these so-called theater defense programs, and while
the administration had requested $132 million for fiscal
1991, it was a Senate Democratic initiative that proposed to
raise the level to $180 million next year. Within this
figure, an estimated $42 million would be provided by the
Senate for the Arrow missile project with Israel, and
Raytheon Co. has a stake in related work to further upgrade
its Patriot missile, which has an anti-tactical missile
capability and is deployed with U.S. forces in the Mideast.
   The House SDI provisions are neither as specific nor as
ambitious as the Senate proposal, but language inserted by
Rep. John Spratt (D., S.C.) cites the need for such
interceptor missiles as one of the top priorities for a
revamped program.
   The debate on SDI came as the House moved toward final
adoption -- likely today -- of the underlying $283 billion
authorization bill for the Defense Department. Unlike the
Senate, the measure would stop production of any additional
B-2 bombers beyond the 15 already authorized, but rather than
fight the issue on the House floor, Republican allies of the
administration chose to avoid any vote yesterday that might
influence negotiations during the conference between the two
chambers.

action.
   BSN President Michael Blumenfeld, who owns or controls
about 15% of BSN's stock, said the company only agreed to
provide the list because it was required to do so under
Delaware law. Mr. Blumenfeld also indicated that he remained
opposed to selling a controlling interest to Pelham. "We

said.

   GOLDEN, Colo. -- Adolph Coors Co. said its Keystone and
Keystone Light brands sold more than 2.3 million barrels in
their first year, surpassing the initial sales of many other
recently introduced beers.
   The so-called popular-priced brand was Coors's first
venture into the lower-priced beer market and one of the few
new product introductions from the company. "I think you'll
find Coors will be aggressive in the new product area in the
future," said Craig Guthrie, brand director at Coors.

   Among other successful brands which have been introduced
recently, Miller Brewing Co.'s Miller Genuine Draft sold 2.2
million barrels in its initial year, while Anheuser-Busch
Cos.' Michelob Dry sold 1.7 million in its first year. Miller
Brewing is a subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos.
   Mr. Guthrie said the success of Keystone, which was
introduced without test marketing, was due in part to
effective advertising and to timing in the beer market. "We
could have introduced this beer three years ago and our
results wouldn't have been quite as good," he said. "The fact
that (Stroh Brewery Co. and G. Heileman Brewing Co.) are
having problems certainly helped a lot."

   A federal judge in Cleveland preliminarily approved a
proposed legal settlement between DWG Corp., Miami, and
Granada Investments Inc., New York.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas D. Lambros said he will
consider any shareholder objections to the settlement at a
fairness hearing on Nov. 14. As part of the settlement, three
independent, court-appointed directors will serve on DWG's
board for five years, heading the audit and compensation
committees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   DWG and Granada agreed on Sept. 4 to end their five-month
battle. Granada sued DWG's board in April 1989, charging that
DWG directors had shirked their fiduciary responsibility by
not seriously considering Granada's $22-a-share, or $572
million, offer for DWG in March 1989. The suit also attacked
the high salary and other perquisites of DWG Chairman Victor
Posner, the Miami financier. DWG owns enterprises such as
Arby's Inc. and Royal Crown Cos., and is the crown jewel of
Mr. Posner's empire. DWG countersued, claiming Granada's bid
wasn't a serious offer, rather, a scheme intended to
manipulate the market for DWG shares and allow Granada to
benefit from the stock's price increase.

   Stanley Stahl agreed to Apple Bancorp Inc.'s plan under

rescind two expense reserves it set up last week.
   The parent of Apple Bank for Savings said Monday it would

if the investor buys all shares tendered to him and holds a
majority of Apple's stock before its annual meeting Oct. 10.

   But Mr. Stahl noted that on Sept. 14, the bank set up a $2
million trust to pay expenses that its officers and directors
might incur in connection with litigation between the bank
and the investor. He said the establishment of that and
another $1.5 million trust violates a condition of his tender
offer.
   Apple said Mr. Stahl's "unwillingness to unambiguously
commit to complete his tender offer . . . demonstrates the
risk shareholders face if {his} nominees for the board should
take control" of Apple through the proxy contest he is
waging.
   Mr. Stahl's offer values Apple's nearly 4.6 million shares
outstanding at a total of $175 million. He has said he
controls about 76% of Apple, including his own stake plus
shares tendered under his offer.

costs related to planned layoffs, and write-downs of certain
products.

   The loss will be "fairly large but it's too early to say
how big" said Diane Van Son, director of finance. The quarter
and year end Sept. 30. In the year-earlier quarter, the
company had net income of $564,000, or 15 cents a share.
   Ms. Van Son said the company began to experience a sharp
decline in orders from its casino customers about four months
ago.
   Electronic Data Technologies said its chief financial
officer, David Brogan, resigned two weeks ago "to pursue
other interests." Most of his duties have been assumed by
William Vargas, corporate controller.
   Ms. Van Son said the company plans to pare its work force

   NEW YORK -- Two New York Bancorp Inc. directors who won
their seats after a proxy fight are charging the rest of the
board with refusing to allow them to help supervise the
holding company's bank.
   The charges are in a suit filed in Delaware Chancery Court
by the company's largest shareholder, Patrick E. Malloy III,
who has a more than a 9% stake, and an attorney, Michael A.
McManus, who has less than 1%. Mr. Malloy also is president
of Malloy Enterprises Inc., a Sag Harbor, N.Y., real estate

   In January, Messrs. Malloy and McManus won a proxy fight

   New York Bancorp, the Queens, N.Y., parent of Home Federal
Savings Bank, declined to comment on the suit.
   The suit charges that the plaintiffs have been unable to
help oversee Home Federal because the bank's affairs are
dealt with only by directors of the bank, not by directors of
the holding company. The lawsuit charges that the holding
company's board departed from its routine by not naming
Messrs. Malloy and McManus to Home Federal's board.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, New York
Bancorp shares fell 37.5 cents to $11.375.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Judiciary Committee approved
a plan under which makers of computer software could bar
video stores and others from renting them to customers.
Manufacturers have complained that video game rentals cut
into sales.
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mike Synar (D., Okla.), is
similar to a law under which record makers are allowed to bar
rentals. The software measure sailed through the Committee by
a voice vote, despite objections from video rental store
operators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sponsors are expected to push for early action on the
measure. The Senate already has passed similar legislation.
   The idea behind the bill is that it is easy to copy both
records and computer software stored on floppy disks. Rentals
thus are considered to undercut copyrights held by
manufacturers. Games often are priced from $40 to $50. Under
the bill, manufacturers could allow rentals or bar them. In
the case of records, most makers don't allow rentals.
   The bill applies to a wide range of computer software, in
addition to video games, but rentals of games by stores that
specialize mainly in renting movies is the main focus of the
issue.

   Bank, Colonial Realty Dispute $2 Million Shift

   Two officials of Colonial Realty Co. transferred $2
million from investment partnerships they managed into
personal accounts just before disclosing that the troubled
real estate marketer would be unable to pay debts, according
to bankers who worked with the company.
   A spokesman for Colonial said that the transfers "never
happened."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two officials, Benjamin Sisti and Jonathan Googel, are
founders and partners of Colonial, a West Hartford, Conn.,
syndicator of about $1 billion in real estate partnerships.
Last week, six Connecticut banks filed to place Colonial,
Messrs. Sisti and Googel and another Colonial partner into
bankruptcy proceedings in federal court in Hartford., Conn.
   The bank transfers worried officials of Burritt
Interfinancial Bancorp., of New Britain, one of the six
banks, according to bankruptcy court affidavits filed by two
Burritt officials. The bankers said that the transfers were
made just before Messrs. Sisti and Googel declared they would
be unable to pay debts that Colonial owed and were declaring
a moratorium on interest payments.
   Colonial disputed the bankers' accounts. Transfers from
the partnerships' account to Messrs. Sisti and Googel "never
happened," said Tom Drohan, a Colonial spokesman. "The money
was routed to clients' funds to finance projects. The banks
were attempting to tie up our operating capital."
   The transfers, if they occurred as Burritt said, could be
a subject for possible legal action against the Colonial
officials, according to federal law enforcement officials,
who asked not to be named. The funds in the partnership
accounts, Burritt says, were owned mainly by the individual
investors to whom Colonial had sold partnership interests.
   The disputed transfers are just one aspect of lenders' and
investors' concern about Colonial, which has been squeezed by
the slumping real estate market in Connecticut and in many of
the other 18 states where its partnerships own property.
Bankers to Colonial estimated yesterday that loans to
Colonial, the partnerships and Colonial officials total more
than $1 billion.
   With some of the properties known to be operating at a
loss, and closely held Colonial saying little about the
specifics of its financial woes, both banks and
limited-partner investors are getting edgy. Colonial says it
has "several thousand" partnerhip investors and that it is
current with all of them in distribution payments.
   West Hartford investor Leslie Daniels says he bought into
a 220-unit Tamarac, Fla., apartment complex partnership
marketed by Colonial and Advest Group Inc. Mr. Daniels said
that each partnership unit lost $10,500 in 1990, three times
the projected loss of $3,800.
   Although Colonial recently suspended quarterly
distributions to many of its limited partners, Mr. Daniels
says Colonial so far "hasn't broken a promise" because the
payout is not technically due until the end of the year.
   What worries Mr. Daniel and other investors is that they
may be forced to make good on promissory notes, or pledges to
add more capital to the partnerships in the future, even if
the ventures go sour and Colonial can't make payments it
promised the investors.
   "The big question that all of the investors have is, `Do
we throw good money after bad?' " he said. Investors are
considering the ramifications of walking away from the deal,
he said, adding: "If the downside is not too great, we might
just do that."
   Several authorities on real estate limited partners say
that investors might not have much choice but to continue
making payments.
   "Chances are, they're up the creek," said Spencer
Jefferies of Partnership Profiles, a Dallas partnership
research firm. Even if the general partner doesn't make a
payment guaranteed to the investor, in nearly all cases the
investor must continue meeting payments into the partnership,
Mr. Jefferies and other partnership specialists say.
   Others potentially at risk include mortgage holders on
Colonial partnerships' properties and banks that loaned money
to the partnerships secured by the investors' promissory
notes. Colonial says it has sold about 85 partnerships since
its founding in 1966, with the bulk of them still active.
   One big interested party is General Electric Credit Co.,
mortgage holder for Constitution Plaza, a Hartford building
owned by Colonial Constitution Partners LP. Earlier this
month, the General Electric Co. unit confirmed, it exercised
its right to receive rental payments from tenants directly,
rather than receiving mortgage payments from Colonial, the
partnership's manager. GE declined to specify the amount of
the mortgage, but bankers familiar with Colonial said it
exceeded $100 million.
   Virginia Steinberg, a spokeswoman for GE Credit, said it
"was too early to tell" whether any of the mortgage loan was
at risk. "Colonial Realty has been a good client," she said.
"We're working with them in their financial difficulties."
   Citytrust Bancorp., of Bridgeport, Conn., also confirmed
yesterday that it had loans outstanding to Colonial or its
partnerships. Citytrust declined to discuss particulars of
the loans.

   LOS ANGELES -- Charles H. Keating Jr., former chairman of
American Continental Corp., surrendered to California
authorities yesterday on a 42-count criminal fraud
indictment. He was being held in a county jail here in lieu
of $5 million bail.
   Also indicted by the state grand jury, which since March
had been investigating the failure of American Continental's
California-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association, were a
former president of American Continental and two former
Lincoln presidents. Bail was set at $1 million for Judy E.
Wischer, who with Mr. Keating resigned from American
Continental last month, and for Ray S. Fidel and Robin S.
Symes, the indicted former Lincoln officials. American
Continental is based in Phoenix, Ariz.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The indictment alleges violations of the California
corporations code, prohibiting false statements in the sale
of securities and requiring securities transactions to be
within qualifications approved by the state. The case focuses
on the more than $200 million of unsecured American
Continental debentures sold to 23,000 investors, often
through Lincoln branch offices, before American Continental
filed for federal bankruptcy-court protection in April 1989.
   That bankruptcy-court filing rendered the debentures
worthless. Civil suits filed by bondholders, many of them
retired people who contend that they were targeted for bond
sales in Lincoln branches, have alleged that Lincoln
officials claimed that the debentures were federally
guaranteed and were as safe as insured certificates of
deposit.
   If convicted, each of the four faces a maximum prison term
of 10 years and a fine of $250,000.
   Attorneys for Mr. Keating, 66 years old, and for Mrs.
Wischer, 42, and Mr. Fidel, 32, left the courtroom without
commenting to reporters. The former American Continental
chairman, however, has insisted in the past that purchasers
of debentures were told they were unsecured. He also has
asserted that the bonds are worthless only because the
government forced American Continental into Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings by moving to seize Lincoln.
   Donald Smaltz, an attorney for Mr. Symes, called the
amounts of bail for the four "outrageous with a capital `O'"
and "punitive in nature." He said his client, who traveled
from his Ohio home to face the charges, has been unemployed
since leaving Lincoln last year. "That amount of bail is
impossible for Mr. Symes," the attorney said, adding that he
intends to seek a review.
   "Everybody was just shocked," Mr. Smaltz said of the bail
levels. "These people aren't selling anything. They're not in
a position to engage in any alleged securities violations,
which is what this case is all about, and they're not a risk
of flight," he said.
   The usually flamboyant Mr. Keating, himself a lawyer, was
unflinching in court, even when the $5 million bail was
imposed and he was led to a temporary courthouse lock-up
prior to an expected transfer to the central county jail in
downtown Los Angeles. Though Mr. Keating has been the center
of national controversy over his management of American
Continental for more than a year, these were the first
criminal charges to be filed against him.
   The four were booked, fingerprinted and photographed
before appearing before Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner.
The judge, who set formal arraignments for Oct. 5, said the
bail amounts reflected the seriousness of the charges and the
amount of loss by investors. He added that bail might have
been higher had the four not voluntarily surrendered to
investigators.
   The indictment had been sealed for a week, although its
existence was learned about Monday. The state's investigation
began last December, when Los Angeles County District
Attorney Ira Reiner was named to head a statewide
"prosecutors' task force" studying Lincoln's collapse in what
federal officials say is one of the costliest thrift failures
ever for taxpayers.
   Most attention nationally in the American Continental case
has involved charges Mr. Keating and others fraudulently
transferred funds out of Lincoln into American Continental
through phony tax and real-estate loan transactions, which he
has denied.
   The U.S. has filed a $1.1 billion civil racketeering suit
containing those allegations, and in ruling against Mr.
Keating's own separate challenge to the government seizure of
Lincoln, a federal judge said that American Continental's
activities "amounted to a looting of Lincoln." A federal
grand jury in Los Angeles also is investigating Mr. Keating
and others, according to people knowledgable about the
investigation.
   While yesterday's indictment itself was little more than a
list of bondholders, each connected to an alleged state-code
violation, the district attorney said the testimony of 94
witnesses to the grand jury could be unsealed soon to provide
more detail.
   The grand jury has been dismissed, although a spokeswoman
for Mr. Reiner said the investigation of Lincoln's collapse
continues and that another, sitting grand jury could hear
further evidence, or that other criminal complaints could be
filed.
   Mr. Reiner told a news conference that his intent was "to
have this be tightly focused so it could be easily understood
by a jury." He said previous efforts to prosecute alleged
thrift frauds often were "far too complex for a jury to
comprehend." Prosecutors, who said the desire to simplify the
case was one reason no more than four people were indicted,
estimated that their case could take only four to six weeks
to present.

   Corroon Rejects Aon's $840 Million Bid
   In Favor of a Merger With Willis Faber

   Corroon &amp; Black Corp. spurned a $40-a-share, or $840
million, acquisition proposal from Aon Corp. and said it will
proceed with plans to merge with Willis Faber PLC of London
in a stock swap currently valued at $30.01 a share, or $615.2
million.
   But Aon, saying it found Corroon's rejection "incredible,"
reiterated its offer and said its all-cash bid "remains on
the table and is not being withdrawn." Initially, the
Chicago-based insurer had said it wouldn't proceed if
Corroon, an insurance-brokerage concern, opposed the bid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New York-based Corroon, which late yesterday unanimously
rejected Aon's bid, said it favored the international
presence it would gain by merging with the British insurance
broker. Richard Miller, Corroon's chairman and president,
said the planned merger with Willis Faber "has become the
centerpiece of our longstanding plans to internationalize our
operations. . . ."
   In a statement issued last night, Aon Chairman Patrick G.
Ryan said, "We find it incredible that they came to this
conclusion without even talking to us or to our investment
bankers about our proposal. They have never heard our
domestic and international strategy for a combined
Corroon/Aon which, like our price, is clearly superior to a
combined Willis/Corroon."
   Mr. Ryan said, "Our proposal was superior when made and
has become even more superior due to a fall in the Willis
Faber stock price." Indeed, since it launched its bid in
June, Willis shares have declined, while Corroon's jumped
last week on news of Aon's bid.
   Yesterday, Willis Faber fell two pence to 201 pence in
London trading. When Willis Faber made its merger proposal to
Corroon June 4, the offer was valued at $34.72 a share, or
$712.3 million, based on Willis Faber's closing price of 265
pence.
   Corroon shares closed at $35.50, down 37.5 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Aon rose 25 cents to
$32.25.
   Takeover-stock traders said Corroon's stock is likely to
fall $2 a share or more today because of the bid rejection,
which was announced after the market closed yesterday.
   With Aon pressing on with its bid for Corroon, the fight
could hinge on legal precedents set in last year's battle for
Time Inc. In the Time case, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled
that Time could reject an all-cash hostile bid from Paramount
Communications and proceed with plans to merge with Warner
Communications Inc. in a stock swap. Under the terms of the
stock swap, former Time shareholders would own about 40% of
the merged company's shares.
   The Delaware courts ruled that such a transaction didn't
constitute a change in control of Time and therefore Time's
board wasn't required to consider other bids, such as
Paramount's.
   Corroon, like Time, is incorporated in Delaware. Corroon
shareholders will own 40% of the merged companies and the
rest will be owned by Willis Faber shareholders. Some
takeover experts believe the Delaware courts are likely to
allow Corroon to reject any Aon offer and complete the
proposed merger with Willis Faber.

   WASHINGTON -- Iraq has significantly increased the number
of troops and tanks it has deployed in and around Kuwait, but
the bigger force still appears to be in a defensive posture,
the Pentagon said.
   Iraq now has 360,000 troops and 2,800 tanks in occupied
Kuwait and nearby areas of Iraq, said Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams. Those estimates are up from the Pentagon's
estimates of 265,000 troops and 2,200 tanks two weeks ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Williams said that while there are more Iraqi tanks in
the area, some of them have been pulled back to positions
farther away from Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia, where
some 130,000 American soldiers are massed along with forces
from several other nations. Still, the higher overall troop
and tank estimate is significant, because it shows a steady
growth in the size of the force Iraq could immediately use if
hostilities erupt.
   At the same time, the Bush administration sent a series of
mixed signals to Jordan, a neighbor of Iraq that has
maintained good ties with Baghdad since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. The State Department reproached Jordan
for playing host to a conference last weekend of Arab
radicals that openly called for attacks on American targets
and the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   "We were surprised and dismayed that this conference took
place, and we have told the Jordanians so," said Margaret
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman. "We want to work
with Jordan during and after this crisis in the Gulf. Hosting
the conference is very hard for us to understand."
   At the same time, the State Department reported that
Jordan still appears to be receiving about 40% of its oil
from Iraq, a technical violation of the international trade
embargo. But the department seemed sympathetic toward
Jordan's need for Iraqi oil. Ms. Tutwiler emphasized that
Jordan had reduced its dependence on Iraqi oil from 90%
before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and she said she hoped
Jordan could cut its use of Iraqi oil further as it gets new
economic aid from other countries.
   Separately, the Pentagon disclosed that American sailors
stopped and boarded a Soviet cargo ship as it carried goods
to the Jordanian port of Aqaba. American forces determined
that the cargo wasn't bound for Iraq and let the ship travel
on to Jordan, the Pentagon said.
   The U.S. also announced that it is sending three military
aircraft to fly relief missions to help refugees from Iraq
and Kuwait who have fled to Jordan. The planes will carry in
blankets, cots and other supplies for the refugees and carry
some of the refugees to their homelands.
   The increase in Iraqi troop strength in and around Kuwait
appears to be at least partly a result of a slight
restructuring of forces by Iraq as it consolidates its
positions in the area. Mr. Williams, the Pentagon spokesman,
said that the increase was caused partly by the addition of
troops to "round out" Iraqi units sent in earlier and partly
because infantry units, which use more troops, are being
moved forward as armored units are moved back from the Saudi
border.
   "There has been a gradual buildup in Iraqi forces since
this operation began," Mr. Williams said. "There has been no
sudden surge. It's certainly a continued buildup."
   Separately, Central Intelligence Agency Director William
Webster warned in a New York speech that Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein has "recently revived" his ties "to those
Palestinian terrorists who have gone after Western
interests."
   Mr. Webster said "what intelligence has tracked and
reported in the past year about Iraq's involvement in
terrorism concerns us." He said American intelligence has
determined that Saddam Hussein now "has both strong ties to
Palestinian terrorists and an elaborate network within his
own intelligence service capable of carrying out terrorist
attacks."
   The CIA chief specifically cited Saddam Hussein's ties to
terrorist groups led by Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas. Iraq's
renewed ties to terrorists had been reported, but Mr.
Webster's is the strongest on-the-record confirmation that
U.S. intelligence is concerned about it.
   Mr. Webster also disclosed that the CIA has set up special
task forces to work on the Persian Gulf crisis, and is
monitoring Iraqi troops, ships, terrorists and "the condition
and status of the foreign hostages being held in Iraq and
Kuwait."

   American Stores Co., a leading food and drug retailer,
said it is exploring the sale of Acme Markets Inc., its
275-store East Coast subsidiary.
   Late yesterday, the Salt Lake City company announced that
its board had authorized management to seek buyers for the
Malvern, Pa., supermarket chain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sale of Acme would help reduce American Stores' debt,
which soared to $2.3 billion after its 1988 takeover of Lucky
Stores Inc.
   Acme, which the parent said had sales of $3.3 billion last
year, has outlets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, New York and Virginia.
   J. L. Scott, chief executive officer of American Stores,
said proceeds would be used to reduce debt and allow American
Stores to build stores and modernize others.
   The company has agreed to sell its remaining Alpha Beta
stores in Southern California within five years to settle an
antitrust action brought by California.
   Last month, the company also agreed to sell its Buttrey
food and drug division for about $184 million to an
investment group led by management of Buttrey and the
merchant banking firm of Freeman Spogli &amp; Co.
   American Stores said that it had retained Lehman Brothers
to solicit bids for Acme.

   Stokely USA Expects
   Quarter's Net to Fall
   By Half; Pricing Cited

   OCONOMOWOC, Wis. -- Stokely USA Inc. said it expects net
income for its second quarter ending Sept. 30 will fall by
half, because of lower prices for its canned and frozen
vegetables.
   The company, which processes and markets vegetables,
fruits and juices under its own brand and for private-label
venders, also said it expects sales to drop about 10%, in
part because it opted for a "nonaggressive" sales policy
earlier this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year-ago second quarter, Stokely had earnings of
$3.2 million, or 38 cents a share, on sales of $60 million.
   The company said prices for its products declined earlier
this year, based on "buyer expectations of larger-than-normal
supplies being produced." Stokely's own assessment was that
poor planting and growing conditions this spring made those
projections premature, and so the company didn't cut prices
to get contracts from some canning accounts. "We have a
number of customers we have to service on a twelve-month
basis," said a spokesman. "If we think we're going to have
less product available," he said, the company is disinclined
to engage in price cutting to get additional contracts.
   "The outlook for supply and pricing still remains
uncertain," said Chairman Joseph B. Weix. A spokesman said
the industry is "not looking at an oversupply situation,"
citing among other things the "possibility of significant
demand increases related to European crop failures and to our
military buildup in the Mideast," factors which might boost
currently depressed margins. The "disappointing" projected
results, Mr. Weix said, thus "are not necessarily indicative
of results for the balance of the fiscal year."
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Stokely
shares fell $3.125, to close at $13.

   WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. said it agreed to
purchase OverSeas Telecommunications Inc., an international
satellite and fiber-optic concern. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The move is part of MCI's continuing effort to boost its
international voice, data and video communications business.
Since 1982, MCI has sought to expand its global reach
primarily through acquisitions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The long-distance telecommunications concern bought
Western Union International Inc. in 1982; RCA Global
Communications Inc., a high-speed data and telex concern, in
1987; and a 25% stake in Infonet Services Corp., an
international dataswitching network and computing-services
concern, last January.
   Privately held OTI, based in Alexandria, Va., provides
digital communications services and operates 24 earth
stations world-wide, and thus will give MCI a larger presence
in 27 countries. OTI specializes in small customer premises
satellite services between the U.S. and Latin America. It
also offers satellite earth-station project management,
overseas private-line channels and international video
services.
   Annual revenue for OTI wasn't available.
   Robert B. Morris III, a telecommunications analyst with
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said the acquisition is important to
MCI because the company holds such a small share of the
global marketplace and is "virtually unknown" outside the
U.S. "By purchasing other entities, MCI will raise its global
presence and expand its market," he said.
   MCI's current share of the international telephone market
ranges between 12% and 13%, while American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. dominates with an estimated 80% to 85% share.
   OTI will give MCI a stronger foothold in such markets as
West Germany, France, Spain, Singapore, Japan, Australia,
Mexico, Argentina and Brazil.

   Rumors Buffet Chase Manhattan Stock
   In a Show of Investor Fears on Bank Sector

MAJOR MONEY CENTER BANKS (BAN)
BANKS (BNK)
CDS, INTEREST RATES, COMMERCIAL PAPER (FIN)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- In rumor-fueled trading, the stock of Chase
Manhattan Corp. yesterday was the big bank that had Wall
Street worried the most.
   Showing how touchy the market for bank stocks is these
days, Chase fell as much as $2 a share to $13.875 at one
point, before closing at $15, down 87.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading of 1.6 million shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sparking the slide were rumors that Chase was having
trouble selling its commercial paper, or short-term corporate
IOUs. Chase responded by not only denying the rumors but also
charging arbitragers with "spreading certain rumors in an
unsettled commercial banking climate."
   Traders and analysts had their fill of rumors from all
directions. "I heard a litany of Chase's problems all day.
But there was nothing new," said the head trader at one large
brokerage firm. "In this environment, no one, especially
portfolio managers reporting third-quarter positions, wants
to hold anything that has the slightest hint of bad news."
   Chase's stock already is among the most troubled among
major commerical banks. As of Friday, it was off 63% from its
52-week high of $44.875, while the average major bank stock
was off 51%. Banks are off more sharply than the stock market
because the weakening economy and regulatory pressures have
caused one bank after another to make unexpected provisions
for problem loans, especially in real estate.
   The rumor about Chase's commercial paper came atop other
investor concerns about Chase and rekindled old concerns as
well. They included worries that Chase's dividend, now
yielding a hefty 16%, would be cut or eliminated and that a
previously announced restructuring would result in a big
third-quarter loss.
   "I've heard every rumor today except that management is
leaving," said Frank DeSantis, an analyst with PaineWebber.
He and other analysts said they don't believe that Chase's
dividend is in imminent danger.
   An executive at Chase, in denying the rumors that Chase
couldn't sell its commercial paper, also said the bank
holding company relies on that market for only 2% of its
funding. Even if the paper market were to shut Chase out,
"We're pretty flush with cash and have other sources of ready
funding," he said.
   From a credit standpoint, "investors overreacted," said
Fay Wong, a bank analyst with Fitch Investors Service, a
rating concern. Still, the reason Chase's stock remains
vulnerable, according to some analysts, is that the bank has
yet to give much of a signal to investors on how much its
restructuring will cost, what Chase will do to keep its
capital levels in compliance with new international standards
and what exposure the bank has to problem loans.
   "The scope of further charges is what the market is
waiting to hear," said James McDermott, head of research at
Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. Shortly after a new management team
was announced this summer, Chase said it planned to save
about $300 million a year after a restructuring that would
eliminate jobs.
   Mr. McDermott estimates that voluntary retirements and
mandatory layoffs could cost as much as $250 million, which
will be taken before year's end. He said he also expects
Chase will add at least $325 million to its loan-loss
reserves in the third quarter, up from a $250 million
provision in each of the first two quarters.
   The latest decline in Chase's stock is especially
troubling for holders who purchased more than $600 million of
newly issued Chase shares last October at $40 each. The stock
offering, the first since the bank was founded in 1877, left
Chase executives disappointed because underwriters had missed
the $44 level that the shares were trading at a few weeks
earlier.

   EUREKA SPRINGS, Ark. -- Unshaven, his sandy hair lapping
over the collar of his weathered denim vest, Herbie Shreve
roars into town on his Harley-Davidson, prompting a few
stares from the busloads of Bible Belt churchgoers here for
the outdoor passion play, one of the chief attractions of
this Ozark tourist haven.
   Mr. Shreve, however, has business elsewhere. He heads his
motorcycle down a gravel road rutted like a washboard and
pitches a tent in a lakeside clearing where hundreds of other
bikers have gathered for a boozy weekend rally. Here, he will
spend the next 48 hours as he spends most weekends: trying to
save souls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Biking and Bibles would seem an unlikely combination. But
as a leader of the Christian Motorcyclists Association,
33-year-old Mr. Shreve is no purse-lipped, fire-and-brimstone
evangelist. Eschewing what he calls the pushy "vacuum cleaner
salesman" approach, he's as adept at "kickin' tires" --
talking shop with other bikers -- as he is at quoting
Scripture.
   The CMA encampments that are fixtures at most motorcycle
events nowadays provide free ice water and Biblical tracts,
as well as volunteers eager to preach the Gospel should a
biker amble by. But there is no hard sell. "They will seek us
out when it's the right time," Mr. Shreve says serenely.
   Mr. Shreve is thus able to mingle easily with people like
"Cowboy," a towering, long-haired biker from Little Rock who
rides with the tough Bandido club. "As long as he doesn't try
to judge me, we get along fine," Cowboy says of Mr. Shreve.
"I'm a Christian and not ashamed of it," he says. "I just
live differently than the CMAers do. They stick closer to the
rules."
   CMA was founded by Mr. Shreve's Baptist-preacher father,
Herb Sr., who took up motorcycling to draw closer to his
then-rebellious teen-age son. As the pair biked around the
heartland, often snubbed by fellow Christians when they tried
to attend church along the way, the preacher hatched plans
for a motorcycle ministry. "Jesus said, `Go on the highways
and hedges,' and that always stuck with me," says the elder
Mr. Shreve. "I felt churches ought to be wherever the people
were."
   So in 1975, he resigned from his church in Cove, Ark.,
moved his family out of a comfortable parsonage and took to
the road. The pastor's wife, Shirley, who found herself
suddenly supporting the family with Tupperware parties, gave
him one month to make good.
   The group has since grown to 33,000 members in more than
300 chapters in the U.S. and Canada, Herbie Shreve says.
   To get to Eureka Springs, Herbie Shreve and his wife,
Diane, have cycled four hours from their home in Hatfield,
Ark., where CMA is headquartered. At the campground, they
rendezvous with about 20 CMA compatriots and plunge into the
festivities: a noisy parade through town, motorcycle games
and races. Vultures soar overhead, beer flows and a blues
band plays at top volume through the night.
   Some CMA members led rough-and-tumble lives prior to
joining up. "There were no warrants out on me, but I'd been
around the block a few times," says bearded Bill Wisely, a
hospital janitor in Jackson, Ark. Three years ago, he says,
"God started giving me the word it was time to turn my life
over to Him."
   Tonight, he talks not only of the bike show he helped
judge at the rally, but of "witnessing" to some attendees.
   Greg Heinritz of Oden, Ark., used to ride a bike painted
with images of nude women. Now the bike sports murals
depicting Jesus reaching down to bikers on the road. His
famous "Jesus bike," as it's known, has been on prominent
display at big rallies and featured as a "centerfold bike" in
many biker magazines.
   Mr. Heinritz now is a paid CMA evangelist -- and Herbie
Shreve says the bike led one of his young sons to accept
Christ.
   Plenty of CMAers are simply church people looking for a
wholesome crowd to ride with. Some shun what they call
"secular rallies," such as this one. Instead, they congregate
at CMA events that feature Bible study and Gospel music.
   CMA member Frances Wing of Cincinnati, Ark., prayed hard
before deciding to attend a secular rally. "The Lord and I
decided I shouldn't hold back," she recalls. Now she finds
that witnessing to the "down-and-outers" -- the CMA term for
hard cases and rough customers -- is easier than trying to
win converts among the prosperous professionals who have
taken up biking in recent years.
   "They think they are all right, that they're going to go
to heaven," Mrs. Wing says of the upscale crowd. The more
menacing bikers, on the other hand, "know they are sinners."
   During winter months, CMA runs weekend workshops where
skills such as witnessing in parking lots and "handling
negative responses" are honed. Members are also reminded not
to restrict their ministry to motorcyclists. As Herb Shreve
Sr. put it in a recent newsletter: "If Jesus physically lived
in America today and rode a motorcycle, would He witness only
to motorcyclists in America? No way]"
   CMA doesn't assess dues or collect offerings at the
services it holds at motorcycle rallies. Member donations
fund its $500,000 administrative budget, which covers the
salaries of its 13-member staff (including eight paid
evangelists), publication of tracts and a monthly newsletter.
   In addition, it sponsors an annual fundraiser in which CMA
members solicit pledges for completing a 100-mile motorcycle
run. This year's proceeds, $284,000, went mostly for foreign
missions, such as the purchase of motorcycles and even mules
for local ministers in Central America.
   The CMA rank-and-file, who call themselves "weekend
warriors," ride at their own expense. Typical is Dewell
Grisham of Little Rock, a retired installer for AT&amp;T who puts
in 20,000 miles a year on his bike in voluntary service to
CMA. "The pay's not too good," he chuckles.
   "Riding for the Son," the motto embossed on CMA T-shirts
and jackets, isn't easy riding. Severe thunderstorms doused
Herbie Shreve on his way to Eureka Springs. The weekend
before, he camped in a Kansas cornfield in 108-degree heat.
"There was gobs of nudity, and we woke up Sunday morning with
a guy passed out in front of our tent," he says. And two CMA
women at this rally were sidelined all summer after cycling
accidents.
   But no one in CMA, members say, has ever been harmed by a
biker. The closest call came in the early days, when drunken
revelers surrounded Herb and Shirley Shreve's tent at a rally
in Sturgis, S.D., and threatened to burn it down. "Some of
those same people are close friends of mine today," says the
elder Mr. Shreve, who is 56 years old.
   Motorcycle events in general are much tamer now, he adds.
   It is dawn in Eureka Springs, and the CMA contingent fans
out through the campground urging last night's carousers to
join them by the lake for a Sunday service. Four years ago at
this rally, no worshippers bestirred themselves from their
tents, and Herbie couldn't hold a service. Today, about 20
groggy bikers straggle down to the dock.
   Herbie's brief, plain-spoken sermon touches on the bikers'
alienation: the unpaid bills, the oppressive bosses, the
righteous church ladies "who are always mad and always
right." His message: "If you call me, I'll help you fix your
life."
   Though the weekend brings no dramatic victories, Herbie
isn't discouraged. "Always on Saturday," he says, "you begin
to think, `Is this panning out?'" Peer pressure keeps some
away from services, he says. "But they come by afterwards and
talk. We don't get in a hurry to leave on Sunday morning."
   Sure enough, while breaking camp, the CMA group gives away
half a case of tracts to bikers who drop by their tents. And
as Herbie pulls out to leave, two bikers call to him,
thanking him for his words. "I don't remember seeing them at
the service," he says. "You're covering a lot more ground
than you realize sometimes."

   Your Aug. 21 editorial "The Jogger and Gun Control"
displayed a surprising ignorance of not only the raging gun
violence gripping our nation, but also of remedies urged by
law enforcement.
   Law enforcement does not treat felons "gingerly," as you
implied, but police believe we need laws to prevent crime,
not simply take action after the crime. Every major
law-enforcement organization in America -- including the
Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of
Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and the
National Association of Police Organizations -- is urging
Congress to enact two federal gun statutes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Congress is considering legislation to stop the sale of
assault weapons such as the AK-47 used in the Stockton
massacre and the Uzi assault pistol, favored by drug
traffickers. Assault weapons are like armor-piercing
ammunition, machine guns and undetectable plastic handguns.
They aren't used by legitimate sportsmen, and shouldn't be on
the civilian market.
   Such public-safety measures enjoy broad bipartisan support
in Congress. More and more politicians are beginning to
listen to those to whom we entrust our public safety -- the
police -- and not the gun lobby.

   Your editorial is demagogic nonsense. What does this poor
woman's experience have to do with gun control? If someone
dies from a heroin overdose, are we to conclude that there
should not be laws against selling crack cocaine? A barbaric
act was committed with a pipe, a rock and a stick, but not
all barbaric acts are committed with those weapons. In fact,
each year in the U.S. about 9,200 murders -- nearly half of
all murders -- are committed with handguns, while only 6% of
all murders are committed with blunt instruments (including
pipes and rocks) and 6% with personal weapons (fists, feet
and teeth).
   Your editorial has waved a bloody shirt to inspire fear
and fury and to turn those emotions subtly against an
undeserving target. As ridiculous as it seems once exposed,
it actually attempted to blame gun-control advocates for the
attack on the jogger. The editorial's implication is that
gun-control advocates are somehow blocking more efficacious
anti-crime measures. Notwithstanding whatever stereotype
exists in your imagination, proponents of more rigorous gun
control (who today include the organized law-enforcement
community) often favor many other public-safety measures. One
can just as easily favor more rigorous gun control and more
stringent sentencing of violent juveniles as one can favor
prosecuting those who sell heroin and those who sell crack
cocaine.

   Your editorial, in mentioning the verdict in the trial of
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, condoned what you perceived as
the jury's decision to craft a "rough justice" by not
"pil{ing} on" convictions in its verdict. You went on to laud
this outcome as a "common-sense" effort on the jury's part to
keep Mr. Barry from running for re-election and stop him from
claiming vindication.
   I do not share your implicit view that these jurors did
anything except their duty, which was to hear the evidence,
determine the facts, and apply those facts to the law as
instructed by the court. By suggesting that they crafted a
rough justice based (at least in part) on political factors,
you are necessarily assuming that they reached their verdict
in dereliction of their obligations as jurors.
   More distressing than your interpretation of the verdict
is your approval of it based on that interpretation. If you
are correct in your view that the jury had a political
agenda, then the judicial system has broken down and Mr.
Barry has not received a fair trial. If the evidence adduced
at trial proved Mr. Barry's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
on more than one count in the indictment, he should have been
convicted on all of those counts. Conversely, he should not
have been convicted of any counts that were not borne out by
the facts. No other result comports with our Constitution or
the principles of modern democracy.
   I recognize that sentences do not always reflect common
sense, and that they do not always seem just. This may be
acutely true when trials involve public figures whose actions
are not only criminal but also offend their public trust.
However, if we are unsatisfied with the sentences that accord
with the facts and the law as it is written, we must change
the law itself. We can fashion the law to reflect common
sense. But we cannot rely on an unspoken understanding that
jurors may abandon a court's instructions in favor of their
political instincts whenever they perceive a need for "rough
justice." Rough justice is not a high enough ideal for the
American judicial system.

   Your editorial should be made mandatory reading for all
high-school students. They are now the only ones who can stop
the rampage of criminal warriors, on the streets and in
government.
   Our sick society has reaffirmed that crime, indeed, does
pay. Until "We the People" start pushing for crime control,
something the National Rifle Association has supported since
its birth, we will have to live and die with the reality that
criminals control our lives and destinies.
   L. Alan Kudravy

   You are certainly right that there is no connection
between the jogger case and gun-control laws, so why did you
try to make one?
   I haven't heard or seen any gun-control arguments that
claim guns to be the only tools of violence, nor have I seen
or heard any argument that guns are "the {only} key to the
crime problem" -- with one exception: The National Rifle
Association does claim that gun-control advocates say that,
but they don't. Nor is there any claim that "the crime
problem can be {totally} solved" by such laws.
   Guns are often related to violence, but violence is quite
possible without guns. You are right.

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Alfred C. Sikes delivered his most optimistic assessment yet
that the FCC is likely to ease federal rules barring the
three television networks from the rerun-sales business.
   Mr. Sikes told a broadcast industry luncheon here that by
early next year, the FCC will likely rule on how to soften
the so-called Financial Interest and Syndication Rules. The
regulations block the networks from selling series reruns to
local stations, forbid them from sharing in the profits from
reruns sold by other companies and prohibit the networks from
taking partial ownership stakes in programming.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There is an emerging consensus, I believe, in Washington
that these rules do need some adjusting," the FCC chairman
said to the International Radio and Television Society.
   Mr. Sikes said the Federal Communications Commission will
hold a major hearing with all parties in the rerun-rules
dispute some time before the end of this year, with a final
ruling expected in the first quarter of 1991.
   If the rerun rules ultimately are lifted, the entire U.S.
entertainment business could undergo a realignment as
television networks would be freed to acquire, or merge, with
the studios that supply most of their prime time series.
   For years the ABC, NBC and CBS networks have fought to
lift the rules, which were first imposed in 1970 when the
networks controlled over 95% of the viewing audience. Their
share now is 65%, with cable and independent stations making
steady gains.
   The major opposition in the rerun battle has come from
Hollywood's major studios, which largely control the $3
billion-a-year market for reruns and other syndicated
programming.

   Amdahl Plans
   Most Powerful
   Mainframes Yet

   Biggest Model Has 323 Mips,
   Much More Than IBM's,
   But Won't Appear Soon

   Amdahl Corp. said it will introduce the most powerful
IBM-compatible mainframe computers yet, making the company
the fourth player to enter the most recent round of market
jockeying among mainframe vendors, kicked off by Hitachi
Ltd.'s announcement last June.
   After Hitachi threw down the gauntlet with its
next-generation mainframes, International Business Machines
Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. declared their plans for new and more
powerful machines in early September, only a day apart.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Amdahl's new 5995 series of mainframes will include 10
models, which won't be shipped before late 1991. The series
includes at the top of the line an eight-way multiprocessor
with three times the power of any previous Amdahl mainframe.
This premium machine also will be the first IBM-compatible
system to use eight central processing units.
   "Our basic building block {the uniprocessor} is bigger
than theirs," said Joe Zemke, president and chief operating
officer of Amdahl, Sunnyvale, Calif. In terms of raw power,
Amdahl indeed leads the pack. But not by much: Amdahl's new
mainframes offer as much as 54 million instructions a second
for each uniprocessor, while Fujitsu offers 50 mips, Hitachi
45 mips and IBM 41 mips. At the top of the line, Amdahl's
eight-way multiprocessor, the 5995-8650M, offers about 323
mips, while IBM's top model, the six-way ES/9000, has 210
mips, analysts say.
   The Amdahl models also are equipped to handle massive
amounts of memory; each microprocessor can support a total of
10 gigabytes of processor storage. A gigabyte is 1,000
megabytes.
   The new mainframes will range in price from $3.2 million
to $32 million, and Amdahl's four most high-powered models
won't be ready for shipment until at least the fourth quarter
of 1991 and as late as the second quarter of 1992, the
company said. Hitachi has said that its most powerful new
machines will be available in the second quarter of next
year, and IBM has said its biggest machines will be available
in the third quarter.
   Mr. Zemke said that Amdahl made its announcement so early
because, given the spate of claims from competitors, "we
really wanted to clear the air about what we were going to do
and when it would be available."
   In spite of the impressive specifications, the long delay
in shipment -- which has been a feature of the announcements
by Amdahl's rivals -- inspired some dubious reactions from
industry watchers. "Amdahl will have leapfrogged IBM's,
Fujitsu's and Hitachi's latest, that's unquestionably true,"
said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix,
Ariz., who follows the company. "But I get to be skeptical
with any of these claims when the lead time is this long. We
are unfortunately going back to the days of marketing wars.
These are all paper tigers, by vendors who don't want to be
perceived as being left behind."
   Despite the staggering prices at the top of the line --
only a few years ago, price tags topped out at $5 million --
analysts predicted that Amdahl's $32.1 million eight-way
model probably would attract the most interest -- from
corporate customers with huge data-processing requirements.
   While at first glance, Amdahl would appear to be competing
with its own kissing cousin -- it is 44%-owned by Fujitsu --
the Japanese company's new mainframe offerings aren't
IBM-compatible and won't be marketed in the U.S., Mr. Zemke
said. The two companies use the same semiconductor technology
for their new mainframes, but they are designing,
manufacturing and marketing their versions separately.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Amdahl shares closed at $12.125, down 37.5 cents.

first such cut in nine years. The last time it cut its
dividend, Stelco was also in the midst of a lengthy
steelworkers' strike.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Company officials said that the decision to cut the
dividend, payable Nov. 1, could save Stelco about C$4.4
million (US$3.8 million). They declined to estimate savings
from cutting salaries and capital spending.
   The company had planned to spend C$185 million on capital
projects during 1990, a significant portion of which was
accounted for by a project to reline one of its blast
furnaces. That reline, begun July 1, has been halted by the
strike, Stelco said.
   A spokesman for Stelco said salaries will be cut
"progressively" as long as the strike continues. He declined
to identify the size of the initial reductions.
   About 10,000 Stelco employees have been on strike since
Aug. 1. Talks are reported to be continuing under a news
blackout.
   John Allan, chairman and chief executive officer of
Stelco, said in a statement that the company's management is
reviewing all of Stelco's businesses "with a view to
implementing additional cost containment measures including
consideration of various strategic structural changes
directed to improving shareholder value."
   A Stelco spokesman declined to discuss what those
structural changes could include.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has agreed to pay $200 million to
Tehran as an interim step in resolving a decade-old dispute
involving American weapons bought by Iran but held in the
U.S.
   The two nations signed an agreement in the Hague,
Netherlands, according to a U.S. official here, and the
settlement will be submitted to a nine-member tribunal for
approval. The U.S. official said approval could come as soon
as this week. The official added that the $200 million will
be deposited by Iran into a special account at the Dutch
Central Bank from which outstanding claims made by the U.S.
against Iran would be paid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The $200 million is part of an Iranian claim involving
about $400 million in military equipment Tehran owned that
was in the U.S. at the time of the Iranian revolution. The
equipment, impounded after the 1979 seizing of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, includes one combat aircraft, several
helicopters, a submarine, missiles and spare parts.
   The U.S. contends that because the equipment was used and
in the U.S. for repair at the time it was impounded, it is
worth far less than Iran claims. The U.S. also contends that
the balance owed is $93 million, plus interest, and
negotiations between the two nations are continuing.
   Iran has said the total military-sales claim, which
involves about 1,200 items, is valued at about $11 billion.
The U.S. contends that the figure is far lower. The tribunal,
set up in 1980, is the only official point of contact between
the two nations. The tribunal has three judges appointed by
the U.S., three judges appointed by Iran, and three neutral
judges appointed by the six other judges.
   The U.S. has denied that the negotiations, which have been
going on for a decade, are related to the current crisis in
the Persian Gulf.

   Continental Airlines Pays $80.5 Million,
   Assumes Eastern Pension Obligations

   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. said it made a one-time
payment of $80.5 million and assumed responsibility for up to
$600 million more over 12 years to satisfy pension
obligations at its former Eastern Airlines unit.
   In an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.,
the federal agency that insures retirement benefits for
millions of workers, Continental Holdings agreed to pay
nearly all of what is owed on Eastern's seven underfunded
pension plans. Eastern is currently in Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law proceedings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pension settlement is one of the costliest legacies of
Continental Holdings' four-year-long control of Eastern,
which ended with a bankruptcy judge ousting management and
installing a trustee to run day-to-day operations earlier
this year. The parent company still owns the equity and under
federal law is liable for the pension plan.
   Continental Holdings has put up $500 million worth of
collateral in the form of international routes of its
Continental Airlines unit to secure its agreement with the
PBGC.
   Whether Continental Holdings has to pay all of its
obligations to the underfunded pension plans depends on a
variety of factors, ranging from the resolution of Eastern's
bankruptcy-law filing to the interest rates available on
certain annuities. As a result, the actual amount Continental
Holdings ultimately pays could vary by several hundred
million dollars.
   At the very least, Continental said it would have to pay
$225 million, in monthly installments, over the next three
years.
   Continental is obligated to make the pension payment
because Eastern Airlines can't pay the full amount, the
result of the carrier's tenure in bankruptcy court. Eastern
said its only contribution would be a $30 million payment, $8
million of which will be paid next month and the rest on Jan.
15.
   Eastern's money will come from the roughly $1 billion
being held by the court in escrow from asset sales conducted
over the last 18 months of its Chapter 11 case.
   That Continental Holdings would have to make such a
payment was no secret, as it has been negotiating for months
with the federal agency in what were often contentious talks.
It was unclear until now, however, how much of a financial
hit the company would take.
   The pension liability has been an albatross to Continental
Holdings, and the company is understood to have told the
agency that the outstanding obligation was limiting its
ability to secure financing. Continental Holdings, the former
Texas Air Corp., has been unprofitable three of the last four
years, making money this year primarily on nonoperating
transactions.
   The agency considered the payment plan a clear triumph,
since it will have to make no payment and the pension
obligations will be assumed entirely by Continental Holdings.
"We have structured a settlement to protect retirees and the
insurance program from one of the largest potential losses we
faced," said James B. Lockhart, the agency's executive
director. All retirees covered by the seven pension plans
will continue to receive full and uninterrupted pension
benefits from a trust set up to receive the agreed-upon
payments.
   Continental Holdings said the payments will have no
immediate effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Its Continental Airlines unit, however, will record a
one-time charge to its retained earnings, but the amount
wasn't determined.
   In a statement, Continental Holdings' president and chief
executive, Hollis Harris, said "we are pleased that this
matter has been resolved, and in such a way that it will not
hinder Continental's plans for future growth and increasing
profitability."

   THE U.S. BOOSTED its estimate of Iraqi troop strength in
and around Kuwait.
   The Pentagon said Baghdad has 360,000 troops and 2,800
tanks in Kuwait and nearby areas of Iraq, showing a steady
increase, but the forces still appear to be in a defensive
position. Meanwhile, Washington reproached Jordan for playing
host to a meeting of Arab radicals, and Bush said Iraq's
military mustn't benefit from any humanitarian aid shipments.
In Paris, nine European nations demanded that the U.N. trade
embargo on Iraq be extended to the air as well as the sea.

   THE PENTAGON SAID it will eliminate or reduce operations
at 150 foreign sites.
   The cutbacks at the mostly small foreign facilities in 10
nations, mainly in Europe, are designed to carry out pledges
to shrink the size of the armed forces in response to budget
cuts, and to meet force reductions that will be required in
Europe under the conventional arms control treaty expected to
be signed in November. Defense officials said the closings,
to take place over several years, aren't linked to the U.S.
troop buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   The announcement is certain to be welcomed in Moscow,
which is pulling all its troops out of Europe and had pressed
the U.S. to state its intentions.

   IMF Plans Loans
   And Rates Linked
   To the Price of Oil

   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund plans to
seek money from countries reaping higher profits as a result
of recent high oil prices and to lend it at subsidized rates
to nations hit hard by the rise in energy prices, a senior
financial official said.
   The official, who spoke on the condition that he wouldn't
be identified, declined to name the countries that might be
approached for funds, but he said they include the big
oil-producing nations. The countries that might be able to
borrow the funds at below-market interest rates would include
the Philippines, India, Brazil and the Dominican Republic;
all have trouble paying market rates of interest but don't
necessarily qualify for sufficient concessional lending, he
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The idea still must be approved by the IMF's board, which
gathers here next week for its annual meeting. Details,
including the terms by which the oil-producing nations would
provide the funds, would have to be worked out later.
   The IMF believes the impact of the oil price rise on
industrialized countries will be quite limited, provided it
is passed through to consumers quickly rather than allowed to
fuel a sustained rise in inflation. The official said the IMF
expects the rise to trim about 0.5 percentage point from the
output of industrialized countries in 1991. He said higher
oil prices will add about 0.25 percentage point to inflation
this year and between 0.50 and 0.75 of a percentage point
next year.
   The international agency is assuming that oil prices will
average about $26 a barrel in the fourth quarter. Although
prices currently are hovering about $33 a barrel, futures
market prices suggest they will drop to the lower level in
the fourth quarter, economists say. Further, the IMF expects
oil prices to decline to about $21 a barrel by late 1991. Its
forecasts are based on the assumption that the current
situation in the Persian Gulf continues.
   The IMF is strongly against easing monetary policy to
accommodate higher oil prices. The IMF's "clear response" to
the oil price rise is that monetary authorities shouldn't
accommodate this shock with easier monetary policies, the
senior financial official said.
   The IMF official ruled out establishing specific loan
pools such as those set up at the IMF in the 1970s to cope
with the oil price shocks of 1974 and 1979. He added that the
IMF is in a much better position to monitor the effects of
oil price rises now than it was in the 1970s because many
more countries now have IMF programs. There are 50 such
countries today, compared with 20 in 1979 and only 10 at the
time of the first oil shock.
   On other matters, the official said the Soviet Union could
soon become a member of the IMF. "I don't see any special
obstacles," he said. He added that the Soviets haven't as yet
formally applied for membership. The Soviet Union will for
the first time attend next week's IMF and World Bank meetings
as an official observer.
   The senior official also defended the IMF's recent
strategy in its negotiations with Brazil. The Institute of
International Finance, a Washington-based bank lobbying
group, has attacked the IMF for negotiating with Brazil even
though that country hasn't paid billions of dollars of
overdue interest arrears.
   The official said that an IMF economic program with Brazil
will be submitted only to the organization's board if the IMF
is "reasonably sure" that commercial bank negotiations have
started "in full good faith."
   While banks want countries to use their reserves to clear
interest payments arrears, the IMF has to balance that
consideration with the need to establish sound economic
programs in debtor nations, the official said.
