   Mutual Funds:
   Investors Pour More Cash Into Stocks

   Small investors' springtime passion for stock mutual funds
is showing no signs of waning. Investors poured $2.2 billion
into stock funds in April, and fund groups report even
stronger inflows this month.
   So far this year, net inflows into stock funds -- at $7.8
billion -- are 34% above the $5.8 billion for all of 1989.

   Much of this new money hasn't ended up invested in stocks,
because stock fund managers have remained stubbornly bearish.
In April, the percentage of stock fund assets in cash jumped
to 12.5% from 11.9% in March. That rise is the fourth
consecutive monthly increase, according to data from the
Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade group.
   But there is evidence that some of that cash recently got
put to work, helping to propel this month's stock market
rally. Cash positions are falling fast at the 56 stock mutual
funds tracked by Indata, a service of Gordon, Haskett &amp; Co.
The firm says cash at these 56 funds stands at 9.7% of
assets, down from 11.6% at the end of April and 12.5% at the
end of March.
   Signs abound of growing enthusiasm for stocks among fund
managers. Peter Lynch, who retires today as manager of $13.8
billion Fidelity Magellan, has cut the fund's cash hoard to
$1.3 billion from $1.7 billion over the past month. So far
this month, the average cash position at Massachusetts
Financial Services' 14 stock mutual funds dropped to 12.2%
from 12.8%. Janus Group's flagship fund, $1.1 billion Janus
Fund, has shifted to 3% cash today from 22% cash at the end
of April.
   Though April was a strong month for stock fund inflows, it
couldn't match March's feverish pace, when stock funds pulled
in $3.1 billion more than they surrendered to departing
shareholders. (This figure includes new sales less
redemptions, plus money switched among stock funds and other
funds. Reinvested dividends are excluded.)
   April's stock fund sales got a $662 million boost from the
initial offering of American Fund Group's Smallcap World
Fund, which was the second-largest initial stock mutual fund
offering ever. The largest was the $1.1 billion launch of the
Gabelli Value Fund in September 1989.
   People buying global small cap funds "is a sign of
increased confidence," says Avi Nachmany, an analyst with
Jesup &amp; Lamont Inc. "That's about as far away as you can get
from the conservative, capital conservation approach."
Smallcap World now will be closed to new investors until at
least January 1991, so that the fund's adviser can invest the
money already pulled in.
   May's stock fund sales promise to be even better than
April's. "This is probably the best month we've had since the
fall of '87," says Henry Schmelzer, an executive vice
president with New England Securities.
   This month, $300 million has poured into Vanguard Group's
stock funds, up from $187 million in April. The group's
bestselling fund is its Index Trust-500 Portfolio, an index
fund that seeks to track the performance of the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index. Among Vanguard's sector funds, its
gold fund suffered net outflows in May, while its health care
fund was the biggest money magnet.
   In April, small investors put slightly more money into
junk funds than they withdrew, the first time that has
happened since June 1989.
   The overall data, however, show a $272 million outflow
from junk funds in April. But that number reflects a $290
million withdrawal that came because of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Holdings Inc., American Express Co.'s brokerage firm
subsidary. Shearson, which had made an ill-timed move into
junk bonds in early 1989, liquidated its entire junk fund
holdings in April.
   The small investor's renewed interest in junk continued
this month. Massachusetts Financial, T. Rowe Price Associates
and Vanguard all report net inflows into their junk funds in
May.
   April's upward spike in interest rates caused a rash of
withdrawals from bond funds, so that -- excluding junk --
only $239 million flowed into bond and income funds in April,
down from $1.2 billion in March.
   But fund groups say bond fund sales recovered in May.
"We're looking at the strongest new sales in over a year,"
says Michael Hines, a marketing vice president at Fidelity
Investments. "People are thinking that interest rates have
peaked. That's a real turnaround from the month of April."

   Report Says Assets
   Of Taxable Funds
   Fell $1.1 Billion

   Investors resumed pulling their money out of money-market
mutual funds as yields stayed where they've been since
January.
   Assets of 427 taxable funds fell by $1.1 billion to $375.6
billion in the week ended Tuesday, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The Holliston, Mass.-based
newsletter has reported only one increase in assets in these
funds in the past nine weeks -- the week ended May 15.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some of the cash "may be going into the stock market,"
said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report.
"People may be tempted by the latest rally." Individual
investors accounted for most of the latest outflow -- $830
million.
   The average seven-day compound yield of the taxable funds
remained at 7.98% for the second consecutive week. It has
been at or just below 8% for 19 weeks. (Compound yields
assume reinvestment of dividends.)
   The average maturity of the funds' investments -- such
things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
Treasury bills and certificates of deposit -- shortened by a
day to 43 days. It was the first change in seven weeks, but
shifts of one day usually aren't considered significant.
   Shorter maturities generally are considered a sign that
portfolio managers think interest rates are rising, because
they allow a fund to latch onto higher rates sooner.
Conversely, longer maturities are thought to indicate
declining rates. Average maturities have been as short as 29
days and as long as 53 days in recent years.
   The average seven-day simple yield remained at 7.68%. The
average 30-day simple yield also remained at 7.68% and the
average 30-day compound yield again was 7.98%.
   Yields on tax-exempt money funds fell. The average
seven-day compound yield slid to 5.54% from 5.59%. That's
equivalent to 8.27% for an investor paying 33% in taxes, but
just 7.69% for someone in the 28% bracket.
   Assets of the 222 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's
declined by $289.2 million to $75.4 billion. Average maturity
shortened by a day to 39 days.

   Your April 23 article "Smokers Go Out of Their Way to Beat
Restrictions on Lighting Up in Flight" distorted the reality
of the overwhelmingly successful implementation of the
smoking ban on virtually all domestic airline flights. You
focused on a few addicted smokers and one "smokers' rights"
activist funded by the tobacco industry, but failed to
mention that 455 million people fly each year in the U.S.,
the vast majority of whom are thrilled with the new law.
   The measure has been a huge success since it went into
effect on Feb. 25, surpassing even its proponents' greatest
expectations. The almost complete lack of news about the
public's adjustment to the new law is a sign of its warm
welcome. Thus, by focusing on three or four of the millions
of smokers and nonsmokers who have enjoyed your article, you
drew an inaccurate picture of what has occurred.

   So the government has banned smoking on domestic flights,
and passengers are sneaking smokes in the bathroom. Is anyone
surprised? Sooner or later, there will be a bathroom fire, a
plane crash and many deaths.
   Will the government then admit its mistake and restore the
smoking section as the lesser risk? Of course not. The
government will ban bathrooms.

   The current intolerant attitude of many Americans toward
smokers shows with chilling clarity how easily a good
propaganda campaign can create socially acceptable hatred of
a minority. As the harassment, bullying and mistreatment
escalate, it should surprise no one that more and more
smokers are reacting angrily and impolitely.
   The federal law banning smoking on flights of less than
six hours is an excellent example of unnecessary government
action that causes more problems than it solves. Decisions
regarding smoking should have been left to the individual
airlines. The marketplace would have decided the issue
peacefully and efficiently. Why was it not allowed to do so?

   I am sorry that smokers are trapped between their
addictions and the regulations, but like many nonsmokers, the
regulations mean that finally I am able to enjoy traveling.
No longer do I get nauseated just at the thought of boarding
an airplane. No longer do I arrive at my destination feeling
slimed by smokers sitting 20 rows behind me. No longer does
my wife make me shower and change my clothes the moment I
walk in the door from a trip.

   In an April 13 article, you invited the reaction of
Carnegie Mellon University's president, Richard Cyert, to
Yale's "de-emphasizing the organizational approach" to
studying management problems. He responded in kind. Both the
question and the response appear to be outdated. We recently
have changed our program to improve the education we offer to
managers who wish to make a positive contribution to our
society in the private, public or nonprofit sectors. We have
diversified our Organizational Behavior offerings, emphasized
professional, rather than Ph.D., education in this field, and
changed the content of the required first-year course. We
have not "de-emphasized" the school's commitment to
understanding how organizations work and how people work
within them, nor have we "driven . . . out" those who are not
"discipline-oriented."
   We offer an innovative and interdisciplinary professional
education to those who wish to be leaders in management. We
continue to offer courses and to recruit faculty whose
paradigms are drawn from the behavioral sciences. Our recent
curriculum changes are meant to make sure that our education
continues to offer an innovative response to the educational
needs of managers for the 21st century. They should not be
misunderstood as being hostile to organizational studies.

   Knowing Leslie Combs II's "fondness for younger women was
legendary" ("Dead Horse Breeder Raises a Ruckus With a
Beneficiary," page one, April 25), Linda Mauk should have
taken special cautions to see that volunteers (not paid
staff) connected with the McDowell Cancer Foundation
cultivated the late Mr. Combs and involved themselves in all
his vicissitudes. As foundation director, her lack of
professional judgment with a major potential contributor
resulted in this unfortunate situation. She already has let
the issue fester by publicly involving the board and the
community. This can be ameliorated simply by Ms. Mauk doing
the honorable thing and resigning.
   The good work of the McDowell Cancer Foundation and the
needs of those yet to be served by its eleemosynary efforts
far outweigh the personalities and idiosyncrasies involved.
Let Mr. Combs speak from the grave -- that's the idea of a
legal and directed gift.

   HIGHER GAS PRICES are due this summer as more Americans
take to the road.
   The American Automobile Association says a record number
of vacationers -- more than 80% -- will take driving trips
this summer. And that will help boost gasoline prices between
five and nine cents a gallon, the AAA says. "The key will be
how strong the driving season is" says Warren Shimmerlik,
analyst for County NatWest USA.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But analysts say other factors will keep gasoline prices
from surging. More efficient cars are curbing demand, says
Bernard Picchi of Salomon Brothers Inc. -- it's off about 1%
from last year. Moreover, currently tight supplies are
expected to ease. The reason? Many refineries now closed for
maintenance are expected back on line soon to take advantage
of higher margins, created by a sharp drop in the price of
crude this year.
   Consultant Purvin &amp; Gertz Inc. says gas prices "are headed
for a collapse as refiners respond to high margins," but not
until the third quarter.
                                                                                                       

   DROUGHT PRODUCTS find a big market in Florida and
California.
   Stores in drought-stricken areas report strong demand for
items ranging from drums for collecting washing-machine water
to low-flow showerheads. Xeriscaping, which uses
drought-tolerant plants, is catching on in Florida, says
Ellin Goetz of J. Roland Lieber Landscape Architects, Naples.
Rain for Rent, a Bakersfield, Calif., firm that offers
equipment that lets wastewater be used on landscaping, says
the last four months have seen record sales.
   Santa Barbara, Calif., is giving $80 to anyone who
converts to a low-flush toilet. Home Improvement Center says
that's boosted sales to 330 in the last eight weeks, compared
with only "a few" each week previously. Those in the
businesses don't expect the market to dry up at drought's
end. "Everybody is conservation-oriented now," says Beverly
Munns of Resources Conservation Inc., Greenwich, Conn.
   One unlikely drought product: Creative Energy, San Rafael,
Calif., touts its spas, saying they can save a family 900
gallons of hot water a month.
                                                                                                       

   REAL ESTATE AUCTIONS boom, partly because of savings and
loan troubles.
   Auction Co. of America, Miami, says its sales will jump to
more than $500 million this year from $186 million last year,
thanks to a contract to sell real estate for the Resolution
Trust Corp. "This is an auctioneer's dream," says Jim Gall,
chief executive. Industry watchers are waiting to see if the
September auctions bring top dollar. "If this works," there
will be a lot of pressure to move more real estate by
auction, says Christopher Beard of Turnarounds &amp; Workouts
newsletter, Washington.
   Other real estate auctioneers say they are having banner
years even without the RTC's business. "The phone is ringing
off the hook," says Steven Good, president of Sheldon Good &amp;
Co. Chicago. One reason: Many sellers are "in a foot race" to
beat the Resolution Trust to market. Twelve firms did more
than $25 million each in auction sales last year, says
Turnarounds &amp; Workouts, noting problem real estate loans
promise significant future growth.
   One obstacle: the need for adequate time for due diligence
in commercial building sales, says Robert Rudin of Edward S.
Gordon Co. of New Jersey.
                                                                                                       

   ENGINEERS HAVE ETHICS, says a poll for Robert Half
International Inc., Menlo Park, Calif. They were cited by 34%
of executives as being the most ethical type of professional.
CPAs came in second at 24%. Investment bankers got only 1% of
the vote.
                                                                                                       

   HISTORIC PLACES on the most endangered list include
Antietam National Battlefield Park and the gold-rush town of
Deadwood's historic district, says the National Trust for
Historic Preservation. Also among the 11 named: New Orleans'
French Quarter and Walden Woods in Massachusetts.
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN AND MINORITIES still fare poorly in drug company
ads, says Karen Tietze and Maya Smith of the Philadelphia
College of Pharmacy and Science. No female doctors appear in
any ads sampled from either 1979 or 1989; only one in the
1989 sample featured a minority doctor.
                                                                                                       

   CLASS REUNIONS turn into a big business as more women go
back to work.
   In 1981, all high school reunions were organized by
volunteers, but by 1995, one in three will be planned by a
professional, says the National Association of Reunion
Planners, which has seen membership grow to 60 companies from
only three in 1984. Why the surge? "Ten years ago, there were
still enough women at home doing volunteer work," says Betsy
Flaherty of the Reunion Co., Rockville, Md. Today, they
"don't have the time, and what time they do have they don't
want to spend calling 300 alumni."
   Growth potential is enormous, says Shell Norris of Class
Reunion Inc., who pioneered the industry with a part-time
business in 1982. He estimates that Chicago alone has 1,500
reunions each year. His company handles just 115 to 120.
Planners say 10-year reunions are their least favorite. "The
cliques are still intact," says Mr. Norris.
   "In Colorado, they have three-day events," says Linda
Davis of High Class Reunions, Mountain View, Calif. In
California: one-nighters.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Most skateboard injuries occur on homemade or
scoop-shaped skateboards, says physician Richard Dominguez in
Working Mother magazine. . . . Geo Expeditions, Sonora,
Calif., offers "ecologically responsible" Himalayan trekking
where trekkers stay in huts, not tents.

   Tokyo stocks bounced back from early arbitrage selling
pressure to close firmer on average volume.
   Traders said buying of domestic demand-related issues, as
well as some arbitrage buying, buoyed the key index back from
early losses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, British stocks surged, boosted by the rising
Dow Jones Industrial Average and new optimism about the U.K.
economy and the Conservative government's prospects.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 108.59 points to
32926.26. The index fell 373.94 points Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 227.34 points to
close the morning session at 33153.60.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
800 million shares, down from 825 million shares Tuesday.
Advancers outpaced decliners 511 to 414, while 197 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which fell 22.39 points Tuesday, added 5.43
points, or 0.23%, to 2417.09.
   The second section index advanced 15.95 points, or 0.41%,
to 3902.32, after gaining 1.99 points Tuesday. Volume was
estimated at 15 million shares, down from 16.4 million shares
Tuesday.
   "The market was buffeted by arbitrage all day," noted one
trader at a foreign securities firm.
   But although stock prices fluctuated a fair amount
yesterday because of trading linked to futures and cash
indexes by domestic and foreign arbitragers, the market
ultimately was trading on fundamentals, observers said.
   The Nikkei Index closely mirrored the currency's
movements, falling early in the morning with a softer yen and
recovering later when the yen firmed slightly against the
dollar, one equity analyst at a U.S. investment trust bank
said.
   The market evidently is becoming two-tiered, with
blue-chip electricals rising on yen weakness and domestic
demand-linked shares rising on yen strength, the investment
trust bank's analyst said.
   "The (equity) market is a hostage of the currency market:
As the dollar strengthens, the index falls but high-techs
tend to get stronger, and vice versa when the dollar
weakens," he said.
   Yesterday's buying sentiment was also boosted by a
slightly firmer bond market and various rumors about domestic
demand-linked issues, traders said.
   Environmental-control stocks received steady buying,
focusing on a local economic newspaper's report that 15 types
of chlorofluorocarbons may be restricted by the year 2000.
   Ebara, which has been actively traded in the past week,
rose 80 yen to 2200 yen (53 cents to $14.57).
   Construction stocks continued to be bought as well,
boosted by an article in a Japanese newspaper that said these
companies are likely to post double-digit growth in the
current fiscal year.
   Very favorable earnings, which have persisted in
attracting buyers in the sector, have been posted over the
past few days by several construction firms for fiscal 1990.
   Also yesterday, an unconfirmed rumor that Sumitomo Mining
has discovered a high-yielding gold find in Japan's Kagoshima
Prefecture was enough to ignite buying throughout the sector,
one trader at a leading foreign securities firm said.
   On the other hand, blue-chip electrical shares were lower,
lacking any inspiring news to hold them up against
profit-taking, observers said.
   Chiyoda Corp. rose 150 yen to 2690 yen. An article in an
economic newspaper said the plant engineering company
received a large order from a European buyer.
   Among mining stocks, Dowa rose 20 yen to 1000 yen, Mitsui
added 80 yen to 1200 yen, Nippon gained 60 yen to 1070 yen,
and Sumitomo rose 90 yen to 1650 yen.
   Construction stocks included Taisei Corp., up 40 yen to
1420 yen, Ohbayashi, up 30 yen to 1740 yen, and Kajima, up 50
yen at 1970 yen.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share
Index gained 50.6 points to 2346.20, just one point below its
high for the day. Only four of the 100 stocks listed in the
index fell during the day, with four others unchanged.
   Traders and analysts said Wall Street's strong showing
Tuesday and early yesterday was the major impetus for the
London gain. But they said the British market also was driven
by domestic factors, such as the possibility that early full
membership in the European Monetary System could lower U.K.
interest rates and bolster sterling.
   "What we're seeing is a general rehabilitation of the U.K.
market," said George Hodgson, U.K. strategist for S.G.
Warburg Group, a U.K. stock brokerage firm. "People who were
pouring their money overseas realized our market was looking
cheap."
   The market shrugged off a statement yesterday by British
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major that interest rates
could rise. Analysts said base rates should fall by the end
of the year. Traders also responded favorably to recent
opinion polls indicating that the Labour Party's long lead
over Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative
Party has been cut to 15 points from about 20 points.
Technical factors, such as a stock shortage because of firms
scrambling to fill buy orders, also fueled the advance.
   But analysts cautioned that the market, which has been
flat for most of this year, won't hold up against bad news at
home or from Wall Street. If it looks as though falling
interest rates and full EMS membership won't happen until
next year, Mr. Hodgson said, "the market won't sit and
twiddle its thumbs." He added that London "still needs the
comfort blanket of a strong New York market," with falls on
Wall Street likely duplicated in London.
   The rise yesterday on London's Stock Exchange was
broad-based, though consumer sectors showed particular
strength, while oil and property stocks lagged. Volume was
robust, with 556.4 million shares traded, up from 330 million
shares Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Zurich, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Milan; lower in Paris and Frankfurt. South
African gold stocks closed down.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, stocks ended higher in
Seoul, Hong Kong, Taipei and Wellington, and were lower in
Sydney, Singapore and Manila.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   Let us start with a self-evident proposition. What matters
most when you face a new situation or perplexing problem is
not the identity of the people who come up with a solution,
nor the "correctness" of its ideological underpinnings, but
the fact of the solution itself.
   Add a second proposition. The U.S. faces a dramatically
new situation abroad and a large handful of seemingly
intractable problems at home.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Put the two together and you come up with a third
proposition. There is a tremendous political payoff for
anyone who manufactures a package of workable ideas for
refashioning American domestic and foreign policies over the
next decade.
   All of this is a truism, you say. But it is a truism that
does not seem to have led enough people to draw the
appropriate conclusions as of this late spring. The need for
agonizing reappraisals is much discussed. Actual
reappraisals, and subsequent political repositioning, are
rare.
   There is some ferment. On the right, which has held a
near-monopoly on intellectual vigor and muscular politics (if
not intelligent policies) for almost 20 years, there is a
growing call for new thinking. High priests of the Cold War
say it is time to close the temple and worship new gods.
While this threatens schism -- old believers still being in
the majority among conservatives and visceral anti-communism
not easily abandoned -- what is noteworthy is that the debate
is fully joined.
   So, too, is the debate among conservatives on how to
confront the unavoidable realities of persistent poverty,
anemic public education, a tattered social safety net and
environmental degradation. Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
half partisan Cro-Magnon, half brilliant strategist, keeps
machine-gunning ideas at the GOP and the nation in the hope
that some will take. In a satellite TV show the other day, he
highlighted a smorgasbord of ideas on how to apply local
answers to social problems. Former Rep. Jack Kemp, now HUD
secretary, suggests a mix of activist government and less
government. Right-wing think tanks are mass-producing
manifestoes and "new paradigms" beyond count.
   On the left, creative thinkers from Cambridge to
California are writing scores of books designed to move the
nation into a new progressive era. Individual Democrats in
Congress offer pieces of a new approach, some of them
startling in innovation and complexity. Sen. Daniel Moynihan
(D., N.Y.) makes an offer no liberal should be able to refuse
when it comes to cutting Social Security taxes. Profoundly
revolutionary proposals for creating a peace dividend of
immediate impact and breathtaking scope have been tabled, all
requiring that our defense establishment be downsized to
reflect more accurately the substantially reduced
international threat.
   But for all the verbal fireworks and press-release gloss,
monographs and mass mailings, little is actually happening.
It seems even less when compared with the bumper crop of
change and difficulties being harvested inside and outside
U.S. borders. While yeasty ferment is a good sign, bubbles
alone won't do. There must be translation into concrete
programs.
   Examine for a moment the rationale for new thinking and
policies. The revolution and disintegration that have
imploded the Soviet empire and undermined the stability of
the Soviet state are major realities of our time. Another
major reality is the re-emergence of a truly competitive
international economic system, (say the words Japan and
Europe), coupled with growing disparities in the economic
health of the haves and have-nots of the world.
   And here at home there is a neck-and-neck race to see
whose pet ideological theories will turn out to have been
most disastrously wrong. To offer but a handful of the
possible illustrations, there are the squalid shambles of HUD
and the financial black hole created by the savings-and-loan
scandal to prove that government regulation and oversight are
the sine qua non of the good society in the modern industrial
world. Political fecklessness and failed economic theories
have created an explosion of public debt and a long string of
thus-far intransigent deficits, with enough blame to go
around several times over. Each day's headlines bring new
indicators of trouble. This week's included the declining
financial relevance of private pension plans, once hailed as
the nongovernmental alternative to Social Security.
   But in Washington, there is a collective failure to act on
the basis of changed circumstances. It's politics pretty much
as usual. Amid the throaty roars of change, what are
noteworthy are the dogs that have not barked. Intellectual
and political arteriosclerosis seems to have set in,
occasional spasms of production such as the Clean Air Act to
the contrary.
   Consider the Bush administration's approach. When
initially confronted, deny anything has really changed. Then
grudgingly begin to admit something is different. Next,
having acknowledged the nature of change in let us say,
Mikhail Gorbachev's U.S.S.R. or the federal budgetary
situation, claim there is no need for radical alteration in
defense or tax policy. Finally, tiptoe into a new stance with
one leg while straddling the old one with the other.
   As for the Democrats, their problem is that their most
articulate voices find little resonance on Capitol Hill. The
party's congressional wing achieves consensus most often with
patchwork quilts that cover almost every interest but have no
discernible design. There is no overarching theory or set of
common goals around which the party unites or toward which it
aims.
   Conservatives are fond of saying there are no new ideas.
Perhaps, but a combination of old ideas offered with new
intensity would make sense for the Democrats -- or a new
party. It would stress the creation of what a spokesman for
the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce
recently referred to as Germany's "social marketplace
economy." How the objectives were achieved would matter less
than their achievement. The Three E's -- environment,
education and equity -- would be treated as basic to national
security. So would universal health insurance, common to
every other industrial democracy. National tax policy would
be progressive in fact, rather than regressive as it now is
in overall impact.
   The military defense component of national security would
finally be placed within parameters of clearly defined
mission and unexaggerated threat all within the context of a
community of nations infinitely better able to defend
themselves than 30 years ago. Recognizing that
interdependence is an unavoidable reality on most matters,
whether environmental, military or economic, Washington would
recommit itself to breathing new life into existing
international organizations.
   All of this is as familiar as it sounds. It is the stuff
of which the democratic left has historically been made, but
from which it has been steadily retreating. The time has come
to reassert the tradition with imagination and persistence.
The conservatives are already in the field. Taking the long
view, it hardly matters which side wins, so long as the
winner is committed to engaging the world and nation as they
are and proposing solutions to what is there. What would be
unforgivable, and possibly disastrous, would be to allow
today's drift to become tomorrow's inertia.

   Solo Act: In Beijing,
   Chinese Rock Star Is
   The Last Protester

   One Year After Tiananmen,
   Only Hou Dejian Dares
   To Speak Out in Public

   BEIJING -- During the early hours of last June 4, as the
Beijing night resounded with gunfire, a skinny, bespectacled
Chinese rock star named Hou Dejian suddenly found himself
center stage in a tense political drama.
   Chinese troops had just shot their way through thick
crowds of pro-democracy demonstrators, killing hundreds of
civilians and wounding thousands more. When they reached
Tiananmen Square, the soldiers turned their sights on the
several hundred student protesters who had vowed to stand
their ground.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To avoid further bloodshed, Mr. Hou, who had joined
Tiananmen protesters in a hunger strike a day earlier, helped
persuade the students to give up their suicidal course. Then,
trembling, he approached the commanding military officers and
negotiated the students' peaceful retreat. It was one of the
few cool-headed acts in a night full of terror and despair.
   For Mr. Hou (pronounced Ho), the massacre was a turning
point. Today, a year later, he has given up his performing
career and become a full-time dissident. Indeed, he is
China's No. 1 dissenter -- the only person in this vast
nation of 1.1 billion who regularly utters in public the
criticisms of the state that many Chinese share but dare not
speak.
   "I don't like being a professional dissident. I would
prefer to be a musician," says the 33-year-old Mr. Hou. "But
June 4 changed everyone. Today, if I keep quiet, nobody will
talk."
   It isn't surprising that Mr. Hou's candor is highly prized
by the foreign reporters in Beijing. They have had little
access to the Chinese people in the repressive period since
the massacre. Last August, when he emerged from the
Australian Embassy after 72 days' refuge there, Mr. Hou was
beset by reporters. Now, as journalists work on their stories
about the first anniversary of Tiananmen Square, they are
beating on his door again. He has been interviewed by ABC,
CBS, NBC and CNN, plus a slew of print journalists. "He's the
only real interview in town," says Andrew Higgins, Beijing
correspondent for the Independent, a British daily.
   Mr. Hou doesn't exactly fit the stereotype of a dissident:
He is no rumpled intellectual surrounded by books and
absorbed in thought.
   He still lives like the rock star he was. He sleeps past
noon most days, then goes to a hotel to while away his
afternoons playing pool. He drives there in the maroon 1987
Mercedes-Benz that he spent $40,000 to import. After a few
games of snooker, he relaxes in the hotel sauna before
heading out for the evening.
   Mr. Hou receives visitors in his studio, which is the
converted half of a two-car garage, certainly one of the few
two-car garages in all of China. (His three-room apartment is
nearby.) The studio is full of gadgets: an electric piano,
expensive stereo, even a sound-activated, dancing plastic
flower. Mr. Hou lives on royalties from the records he made
in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and he still gets a salary check
each month from his official employer, the Guangzhou Culture
Hall, though he hasn't worked there in more than a year. (He
still gets paid because this is China. Once you are assigned
to a "work unit," you belong to it, even when conditions
change drastically. Virtually no one is fired, and he hasn't
quit. So, they keep paying him.)
   Sitting with guests, Mr. Hou balances an Ovation guitar on
his knee. And between observations on the Chinese political
scene, he will pick a quick blues riff. "My favorite musician
is B.B. King," he says, in his accented but colloquial
English. "Since June 4, I've learned to understand the blues.
It's about facing reality. When you sing, you can't hide
yourself in your voice."
   Despite his privileged life style, Mr. Hou has the respect
of many of China's cowed intellectuals for his willingness to
risk everything he has, including his freedom, by speaking
for the politically oppressed. His fame and his background --
in 1983, he became one of the few Taiwan-born Chinese to
defect to China -- offer him some protection, but his words
may yet land him in prison.
   For the time being, the state tolerates his outbursts,
perhaps to give the impression that China allows dissent.
Police recently stopped tailing his car, and authorities no
longer force him to report his contacts with the foreign
press. With this leeway, Mr. Hou thrives on tweaking the
Communist Party hierarchy.
   His most satisfying moment came on Jan. 26, when officials
of the United Front Department, a Party organization that has
contact with overseas Chinese, invited him to attend a New
Year's party. He was asked to sing and play for the
gathering.
   If his hosts expected something innocuous, they were
mistaken. Mr. Hou took advantage of the opportunity to
deliver a public affront to the party elite. He announced he
would perform "The Beautiful Chinese," a song he wrote to
honor the heroic students and workers who took part in last
year's democracy movement, which has been officially
dismissed as a counter-revolutionary rebellion.
   Here are some sample lyrics:
   My friends who love freedom, let's open
    our wings and fly.
   Listen carefully -- so that no one can
    lie to us again.
   Watch carefully -- so that no one can
    twist the truth again.
   When he finished the song, a couple of people in the big
Beijing banquet hall started to applaud, then abruptly
stopped amid the surrounding silence. Mr. Hou slipped back
into his seat, neither humiliated nor chastened. "They
haven't invited me to any parties since then," he says,
smiling broadly.
   As he is recounting the story, the lights in his studio
suddenly go out. The room is completely dark, but for the
ember of the Kent he is smoking. Not to worry. Deng Xiaoping
isn't listening in and cutting off the juice. It's just a
simple power outage in energy-starved Beijing.
   Mr. Hou does believe that Mr. Deng, China's elderly
paramount leader, personally ordered the troops to open fire
on demonstrators last June 3 and 4.
   "Deng was really the only killer," says Mr. Hou. "Yang
Shangkun doesn't have enough power, and Li Peng is too
stupid." (Mr. Yang is China's president; Mr. Li is premier.)
   On the other hand, Mr. Hou says, the Chinese should blame
last year's tragedy on the political system, not on
individuals. "The `devil chair' makes everyone the devil, no
matter who they are," he says. "Even if I sat in it, I
couldn't help but become the devil."
   Mr. Hou hasn't stopped in Tiananmen Square since June 4,
though he has zoomed by in his Mercedes many times. He urges
Chinese to stay away from the potently symbolic square,
particularly on heavily freighted occasions like the
anniversary of the massacre.
   "I'm not sure if the mad dogs are still mad," he says. "My
suggestion is to keep a safe distance from the mad dogs if
you ain't got a heavy stick."
   Though he says he is still "filled with anger and hate,"
Mr. Hou also sees some faint signs of progress in China. He
was pleased about the release this month of 211 people
arrested after June 4 for participating in the pro-democracy
movement. That, and other indications of a political
softening, he believes, are a direct result of economic
pressure from the U.S. and other Western nations that imposed
sanctions after the massacre.
   "Things are beginning to change for the better," he says.
"It isn't as much as we might have hoped for, but it's a
start. Everyone should try to encourage this kind of change."
   Even Mr. Hou's solitary life as a dissident may soon
become less lonely. Two of those released from jail, Zhou Duo
and Gao Xin, are close friends of his. They were with him on
the hunger strike before troops stormed Tiananmen. The trio
plans to speak out on political issues, beginning with a
joint statement. "Together, the three of us can make a bigger
noise than I alone," Mr. Hou says.
   Mr. Hou isn't sure, however, how much longer he will play
the part of a dissident. At the moment he doesn't know what
else to do. Authorities have approved his application to
leave the country, but he has lost the reason he had to go.
His wife of four years, who had been living in Australia,
recently jilted him for another man, another of China's
political celebrities: Wuerkaixi, a handsome, charismatic and
rather flaky student leader who fled to the West after the
massacre.
   So Hou Dejian, lonely dissident, remains in Beijing,
shooting pool and taking potshots at the government.

   Battle Between U.S. and EC Complicates
   Bid to Boost Trade-Liberalization Talks

   PARIS -- A growing battle between the U.S. and the
European Community over agricultural subsidies has
complicated attempts to boost the current round of
trade-liberalization talks, and the feud could torpedo them
completely.
   The struggle has come to a head here at the annual meeting
of the club of 24 rich nations, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. The fight pits the U.S., backed
by Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many other food
exporters outside the OECD against the European Community.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We have hit a snag in our negotiations," White House
Trade Representative Carla Hills told reporters. "It means at
the least that the European Community isn't yet prepared to
deal with {agricultural} export subsidies." Earlier in the
day, Mrs. Hills told ministers that agricultural trade is the
"linchpin" of the current round of world trade talks being
held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Frans Andriessen, the EC's vice president for external
relations, said the U.S. "has fallen prey to
oversimplification" in insisting that agriculture is so
central to the GATT talks. "Some people wanted to bring
pressure to get back to positions we have given up," said Mr.
Andriessen, a former minister in the Dutch government.
   The squabble centers on how to implement a commitment that
the GATT's 97 member countries made in April 1989 to
negotiate "a substantial progressive reduction" of subsidies
and other policies that distort agricultural trade. The U.S.
and its supporters want to implement that commitment through
negotiations involving four separate aspects of agricultural
trade: market access; internal price supports; export
subsidies; and health and sanitation rules, which sometimes
are used to protect agricultural markets.
   But the 12 nations of the European Community were prepared
this week only to repeat their endorsement of the earlier,
general GATT statement against agriculture subsidies,
according to U.S. and Canadian officials.
   "This is a framework that could be accepted, and would be
accepted, by everyone in the world except the EC," said U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   The EC, whose overall agricultural subsidies are estimated
to cost as much as $125 billion a year, wants to consider all
trade-distorting agricultural policies in the aggregate
rather than looking at specific areas as proposed by the the
U.S. That, according to Washington, would give the Europeans
room to maintain export subsidies while giving some ground in
other areas. The U.S., whose subsidies are estimated to cost
as much as $75 billion a year, seems much more willing to get
rid of such devices.
   The EC's commissioner for agriculture, Ray MacSharry, said
agricultural reform "is a difficult and complex subject to
tackle" and averred that the EC remains committed to "the
path of reform that it initiated several years ago." He said
that since 1986 the EC has cut its overall support for the
arable sector 10%, and its support for the livestock sector
15%.
   Mrs. Hills and Mr. Yeutter said at a news conference that
the dispute over agricultural trade will be left unresolved
in the OECD's annual communique, which is scheduled for
release today. That communique is expected to contain the
respective positions of the two groups of countries without
attempting to reconcile them.
   Some ministers were particularly gloomy about the outcome
of the OECD discussions on agricultural trade. There's "no
reason for optimism from the discussions today," said
Canada's trade minister, John Crosbie, who said the deadlock
over agriculture could threaten the whole round of GATT
negotiations.
   The GATT talks began in 1986 and are due to be completed
by the end of this year. Mr. Yeutter noted that the 97
countries participating in the GATT talks previously agreed
to reach outline accords covering 15 different areas of
trade, including agriculture, by July. A final accord must be
reached by year end to meet U.S. legislative deadlines deemed
essential for the pact's approval by Congress. Because the
U.S. is the world's largest economy and largest exporter, a
trade plan would be doomed by its failure to go along.
   Agricultural protectionism has been growing in recent
years. Mr. Yeutter said protectionism currently adds 40% to
the value of agricultural goods, compared with 21% in the
mid-1960s.
   Some in the EC recognize the benefit of getting rid of
agricultural subsidies, and the U.S. and other nations
clearly hope that dialogue among EC countries in the coming
weeks will produce a greater willingness to compromise.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major argued that
the potential benefits are "huge," saying that by one
estimate liberalizing agricultural protection and subsidies
would save $60 billion in annual government subsidies in
industrial countries and offer developing countries
comparable income gains.

   Another Shuffle

   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- In another shake-up at McDonnell
Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft division here, the company
named two executives to oversee its troubled C-17 military
cargo plane program for the Air Force.
   John P. Capellupo, 55 years old, deputy president of
Douglas Aircraft, was named to the additional post of interim
program manager for the C-17 program. He succeeds Robert
Clepper, who has taken "a medical leave of absence," Douglas
said. Messrs. Capellupo and Clepper couldn't be reached for
comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Capellupo was appointed deputy president of Douglas
Aircraft in January in a move to help shore up performance on
several major transport aircraft programs. He previously had
served as president of McDonnell Douglas's missile-systems
subsidiary.
   The company also named Leonard F. Impellizzeri, 51, staff
vice president for engineering and advanced systems at
McDonnell Douglas's corporate headquarters in St. Louis, as
vice president-deputy general manager for the C-17. He joins
Jack Hayden, who was named to the same post last August. Mr.
Impellizzeri will oversee engineering aspects of the C-17
program, while Mr. Hayden will continue to direct
manufacturing operations.
   "The C-17 has to be the area of greatest concern for
Douglas, because if the cost goes over the ceiling price it
would have a detrimental impact on Douglas's financials,"
said Lawrence M. Harris, an aerospace analyst with Bateman
Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. Douglas took a $72
million charge in the second quarter last year to reflect
cost overruns on the program.
   The contract for the C-17 is a so-called fixed-price
incentive contract, under which the company and the
government share in any cost increases up to a certain
ceiling, with the government assuming the larger share, about
80%, Mr. Harris explained. However, once the increases hit
the ceiling, around $4.8 billion, the contract reverts to a
firm fixed-price contract under which the company must absorb
the cost overruns, he said. "Right now, Douglas is at or near
the ceiling on the full-scale development portion of the
program."
   The executive changes on the C-17 program are just the
latest in a series of shake-ups here that began last year,
when Douglas eliminated four of nine management levels and
forced all managers to reapply for their own jobs.

   Robert Zemeckis's Time Travel Ad Nauseam

   Shortly into "Back to the Future Part III," zany Doc Brown
(Christopher Lloyd) realizes he and Marty McFly (Michael J.
Fox) are about to embark on more time travel, and the Doc
says: "I can't believe this is happening."
   That sentence may be the only one uttered in the entire
film that contains an ounce of true feeling. Certainly that
was the thought on my mind as I watched this depressing
rehash of material that seemed original just five years ago,
when it was. And "I can't believe this is happening" seemed
to be what most of the actors were thinking as they gamely
trudged through their paces yet again.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Director Robert Zemeckis ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit"; "Back
to the Future" and its sequels) has a gift for seeing the
world as it appears in Loony Toons. The usual laws of gravity
don't apply to his imagination.
   What's reined him in has been his ability to succeed with
mediocrity. "Back to the Future Part II," the main purpose of
which seemed to have been to sell advertising space, took in
more than $300 million at the box office. In its first
weekend, "Back III" grossed $23.7 million.
   This time around Mr. Zemeckis and his
producer-screenwriter, Bob Gale, have sent their show to the
Wild West, in the year 1885. That's where Doc Brown landed at
the end of the last movie, and where Marty goes to rescue
him. The setting has allowed Mr. Zemeckis to stage some
elaborate Western scenes. Like a television commercial shot
in Monument Valley, the terrain looks right but you know it
isn't "Stagecoach." Something is being sold, but it isn't
story or character or emotion.
   In much of the dialogue, the characters pass the time
reminding one another what year it is. As part of the Western
homage, Marty McFly calls himself Clint Eastwood and wears a
poncho. Mary Steenburgen was brought in to fall in love with
Doc Brown and to talk about H.G. Wells. This only adds to the
misery, because it brings to mind an earlier Steenburgen
film, "Time After Time," made a decade ago, when she -- and
time travel -- were still fun to watch.
   ---
   The ticket seller at a Manhattan theater showing Pedro
Almodovar's "Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down]" informed patrons before
they paid that the movie is in Spanish with English
subtitles. "Of course it doesn't need subtitles," he added.
"Heh. Heh. Heh."
   The ticket man must have suspected that not everyone going
to see this comedy about sadomasochistic sex/love has a deep
interest in Mr. Almodovar's flamboyantly idiosyncratic vision
of the New Spain. He'd figured out that at least some people
were attracted by the picture's contested X rating, and were
titillated by the chance to see a dirty picture made
respectable by its director's reputation. Mr. Almodovar's
cinematic virtuosity has been much acclaimed around the
world, especially since the success of his kitschy "Women on
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown."
   Those seeking pornographic thrills, however, will be
disappointed by the relative brevity of the movie's one
relatively explicit sex scene. But they won't be as
disappointed as the viewers looking for the wayward bawdy
humor many people managed to find within the convoluted plot
of "Women on the Verge." The only thing in "Tie Me Up]" that
may satisfy both camps is a bath toy, a motorized plastic
scuba diver with a slyly naughty desire to dabble in human
speleology.
   Otherwise Mr. Almodovar takes a remarkably earnest
approach to this story of a psychopath named Ricky who
kidnaps a porn star named Marina and woos her by tying her up
in bed. She disdains him completely until he gets drugs for
her and is beaten up by thugs. Ricky's wounds touch Marina,
and she touches them, and Ricky, and all of this leads to the
X-rated moment of passion.
   Mr. Almodovar has mingled this story of warped desire with
the story of an old film director who has starred Marina in
her first -- and last -- legitimate film. The "legitimate"
film is a horror picture that uses Marina much the way the
porn films do, as a prop with a firm and pliable body.
   Victoria Abril, who plays Marina, has the right kind of
hard beauty, worn around the edges, for the vulnerable porn
princess. Antonio Banderas gives Ricky's madness a sweetness
that somewhat diminishes the crude horror of what he is doing
(brutally forcing a woman to love him). But the movie's ideas
and Mr. Almodovar's handling of them are seriously unfunny.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: But does the movie deserve an X rating? Miramax
Films, its distributor, argues that it doesn't, in a lawsuit
filed against the Motion Picture Association of America.
Miramax, as represented by William M. Kunstler, argues that
the film deserves an R rating, which permits people under 17
years of age to see the film only when accompanied by a
parent or guardian.
   Miramax claims that the ratings board is being harsh on
"Tie Me Up]" because it is a foreign film, and cites several
examples of R-rated American films with equally explicit sex
scenes. These include "Body Heat," "9 1/2 Weeks," "Looking
for Mr. Goodbar," "The Postman Always Rings Twice," "Fatal
Attraction," "An Officer and a Gentleman," "Lethal Weapon
II," "No Way Out," "The Accused," "Dead Ringers" and "Blue
Velvet." Every one of these is available on videocassette.

   At the close of a three-day Arab League summit in Baghdad,
Libya's Moammar Gadhafi said he had stopped attending most
such gatherings because they "amounted to nothing but a big
zero." The Baghdad summit, he conceded, "deserves to be rated
one mark above zero."
   Mr. Gadhafi's modest grade probably reflects the
evaluation of most delegates, none of whom got exactly what
he wanted from a meeting called to tackle what many Arabs
consider the threat posed by Soviet Jewish immigration to
Israel. The delegates split over how stridently they should
criticize the U.S. for backing Israel.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat had hoped for
condemnation of Israel and the U.S., backed with economic
sanctions including, perhaps, a limited oil embargo.
   But such moderate voices as Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd mostly prevailed, nevertheless
ending up with resolutions harsher than they would have
preferred. Mr. Mubarak, arguing against condemnation of the
U.S., said Washington was playing a constructive role in
urging talks between Israel and Palestinians, even though
that plan has been shelved during Israel's political crisis.
   The summit communique threatened punitive "political and
economic measures" against nations that recognize Jerusalem
as the capital of Israel but didn't specify what actions
would be taken. The communique also criticized the U.S.
Congress for supporting Israel's claim to Jerusalem, even
though U.S. government policy holds that Tel Aviv is the
capital of Israel.
   The summit failed to deliver to its host, Mr. Hussein, the
Arab leadership position he had hoped for. Instead, by
agreeing that annual summits would be held in Cairo beginning
in November, the gathering conferred prestige on Mr. Mubarak.
   Palestinian newspapers expressed disappointment over the
summit. Al-Fajr, an East Jerusalem paper, accused moderate
Arab leaders of "taking orders from America."

   Firms Hurt in U.S. Contracting Scandal May Get Help
   ---
   Federal Officials Will Examine
   Losses Coming From Surety Defaults

   For small businesses that have been victims of a
nationwide federal contracting scandal, help may be on the
way.
   Today, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) is scheduled to preside
over a fact-finding meeting in Washington that could
eventually lead to Congress's appropriating funds to repay
firms hurt by so-called individual sureties, says an aide to
Sen. Hatch.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Subcontractors and government officials will discuss with
Mr. Hatch surety problems they have encountered and means to
help the victims. Some federal investigators estimate such
sureties have cheated small businesses out of tens of
millions of dollars in the scandal.
   At the same time, however, a separate effort in Congress
seeks to revive the individual-surety business -- just as it
is dying out in the face of tough new federal regulations.
This time, fans of the measure say, small businesses will be
safeguarded.
   An individual surety is supposed to be a well-heeled
person who for a fee from the prime contractor provides
financial-guarantee bonds on a government building project.
If the prime contractor fails to finish the job, the surety
is supposed to step in and make sure that the work gets done
and that all the subcontractors get paid, even if some of the
money has to come from his own pocket.
   Government contracting officials say the use of individual
sureties grew sharply in recent years as contractors found it
increasingly difficult to get bonding from insurance
companies.
   As reported in this newspaper and elsewhere over the past
year, the individual-surety market was invaded in recent
years by individuals whose prime asset turned out to be an
ability to vastly inflate their own net worth on financial
statements. Many of these bogus financial statements slipped
by federal contracting officers and weren't discovered until
the building jobs went sour and subcontractors weren't paid.
   In February, federal acquisition regulations were changed
to substantially toughen rules on individual sureties. For
instance, if a surety wants to claim real estate on his net
worth statement, he has to prove his ownership and the value
of the property. He also must give the government a lien on
the property until the job is done, says J. William Green, a
Navy contracting attorney.
   Since the new regulations went into effect, "the number of
contractors using individual sureties has shrunk to almost
nothing" around the country, says Albert Proctor, an attorney
with the Army Corps of Engineers. Before the rule changes,
some government agencies estimated that individual sureties
were appearing on more than 10% of their construction jobs.
   Unfortunately, the new rules may be too effective, says
Mr. Green, the Navy attorney who has been a vocal advocate of
tougher individual-surety regulations. Now "all those
small-business men who used individual sureties have a chance
to argue that they can't get any of the {government
contracting} action because the rules are too stringent."
   Which is exactly what some businessmen and their
representatives are arguing. The new individual-surety rules
"have had a devastating impact on our members," says Ralph
Thomas, executive director of the National Association of
Minority Contractors, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group.
   Partly because minority contractors tend to be smaller and
newer than their white counterparts, they have had a more
difficult time getting insurance-company bonding and have
relied on individual sureties, he says. Mr. Thomas estimates
that up to 75% of his members that do government construction
contracting have been hurt by the new rules.
   In response to such complaints, Rep. Cardiss Collins, an
Illinois Democrat, is sponsoring a bill to authorize a pilot
project that would allow individual sureties to form
self-policing associations. These groups would ensure that
claims against individual members got paid. Critics worry
that such a plan would simply pool bad risks and wouldn't
significantly reduce the risk of abuse. The House Government
Activities and Transportation subcommittee, which Ms. Collins
chairs, has scheduled a hearing next Wednesday on the
individual-surety issue.
   What makes the debate particularly vexing is that for
every contractor who has been hurt by the tough new rules,
there seems to be a subcontractor hurt by the old lax rule.
For example, Camilo Ramirez says he is owed over $98,000 for
masonry work his small firm did in 1988 on a building project
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in
California. When the prime contractor failed to pay, the
individual sureties also failed to come up with the money.
   The absence of that money left him unable to pay his
workers or keep up payments on his equipment, which was
eventually repossessed, says Mr. Ramirez. Creditors are
hounding him for thousands of dollars of unpaid bills and his
business, which he spent eight years building, is essentially
closed down. The financial stress contributed to the breakup
of his marriage, says the 37-year-old Mr. Ramirez. "This has
ruined my life. I have nothing now," he adds.
   He does have some unhappy company in the form of about two
dozen other subcontractors who say they are owed a total of
$2.8 million on the same NASA job. These firms have banded
together to demand the federal government pay them, and
representatives of some of these firms are to meet with Sen.
Hatch today.
   Getting Uncle Sam to pony up in such matters is a tall
order, concedes John Tacke, the subcontractors' attorney. The
government aimed to keep itself out of such payment disputes
by requiring sureties.
   A NASA spokeswoman said the agency believes it acted
properly on the contracts.
   Sen. Hatch is looking at introducing special legislation
to pay these subcontractors and others "who fell into the pit
before the surety rules were changed," says Robert Lockwood,
an aide to the senator. Already, he adds, more than a dozen
senators have expressed interest in co-sponsoring such a
measure.

   PARIS -- French prosecutors asked that insider trading
charges be brought against five people, including the French
finance minister's onetime chief of staff, in connection with
a failed 1988 raid on banking company Societe Generale.
   The former chief of staff is Jean-Charles Naouri, who had
left the government and become a banker by the time of the
alleged insider trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Naouri declined to comment, saying he would wait for
the judicial process to be completed. He earlier acknowledged
buying Societe Generale shares in July 1988, before the raid
was launched. He said he bought 10 million francs ($1.8
million) of the shares for the Euris investment fund that he
manages and 1.5 million francs of the shares for himself. He
said he sold the shares before the raid on the company, and
he has denied wrongdoing.
   Mr. Naouri did confirm that before he bought the shares he
was contacted by businessman Georges Pebereau, who later
orchestrated the raid. He said he turned down Mr. Pebereau's
offer of jointly investing in Societe Generale but later
decided to make the investment himself.
   The others against whom charges were sought are three
investors and the estranged wife of one of the raid's
backers.
   The Societe Generale raid became politically controversial
in France, where some viewed it as an effort backed by Mr.
Naouri's former boss, Socialist Finance Minister Pierre
Beregovoy, to manipulate the political composition of Societe
Generale shareholders. The insider trading allegations shook
the government and weakened Mr. Beregovoy politically.

   Speaking recently to analysts in New York, Thomas
Stephens, the chief executive of Manville Corp., tried to
interest them in its "quality businesses and strong
competitive positions." But when it came time for questions,
the analysts seemed mainly interested in "the Trust."
   More than a year after emerging from bankruptcy
proceedings, Manville is striving to overcome its
asbestos-tainted past and push ahead with a new strategic
thrust and a fresh, environmentally correct image. That task
is tough enough, given soft markets and entrenched
competition in many of its main businesses. But at every
turn, Manville is still dogged by the financial problems of
the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, which was set
up to compensate asbestos victims.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a landmark agreement that got Manville out of
bankruptcy court, the company gave the trust $2.5 billion of
assets, mostly stock. It also promised to pay the trust $75
million annually beginning in August 1991, plus 20% of its
annual net income from 1992 until all claims are paid. It
contends that it has no further legal obligation.
   Others aren't so sure. "Manville is basically a very sound
company with good management," says Paul Kleinaitis, an
analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. "But the unknown is the
trust. No one knows what the ultimate liability will be."
   Meanwhile, the memory of asbestos lingers on, even as
company officials swear that Manville's reputation among
customers wasn't damaged. The company has became a born-again
environmentalist. A health, safety and environment committee
independent of management audits all operations and policies.
Scrubbers are being added to smokestacks, and waste sites and
water-storage ponds are being brought into compliance with
government regulations.
   The company is clearly wary of the power of
product-liability law. It is the only major company that
stamps a warning label on its two-by-fours and other wood
products. (Wood dust can harm lungs.) And when the
International Agency for Research on Cancer said diatomaceous
earth, which is used as a filler and as a filter, might cause
cancer, Manville added a warning label to the product even
though that action stirred customer resistance, especially in
cancer-wary Japan. Manville stood its ground as sales slipped
and, eventually, regained prior levels.
   "We want to be way out front in safety and health issues,"
says Richard A. Kashnow, recently named president of the new
engineered-products group. "We want to set some standards for
ethical behavior in those regards."
   Image-makers say this kind of aggressive environmental
makeover is the only way to reinvent a company whose name has
become synonymous with health problems. "You can't just
change the name, you can't just redesign the logo and
everything will be all right," says Gershon Kekst, a New York
public-relations executive (not in Manville's employ).
"You've got to come to grip with reality."
   However, another reality -- the fact that the trust is
running out of cash -- keeps intruding. Earlier this month, a
state court judge and a federal judge presiding over 450
asbestos lawsuits stemming from 1940s employment at the
Brooklyn Navy Yard asked, in an unusual joint memorandum,
whether the trust's overseers had considered going back to
bankruptcy court to alleviate a cash crunch that has impaired
its ability to pay claims. As the New York judges interpreted
the law, the bankruptcy court could choose to lift an
injunction barring asbestos victims from suing Manville
directly. They also suggested that the court could increase
the company's payments to the trust. They even hinted that
they might appoint a receiver for the trust if it didn't work
out its problems.
   The resulting legal uncertainty rattled Manville
investors, who promptly deluged its investor-relations
department with calls. Although the stock fell just 50 cents
a share to $6.50 over the two days following the hearing, 20%
of the common shares not held by the trust changed hands.
(The trust owns 50% of the common, which closed at $7 a share
yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.)
   In response to the judges' questions, the trust filed a
memorandum in court Tuesday arguing that reopening the
reorganization plan "would jeopardize the very structure of
the plan." Anything raising uncertainty about Manville's
liability, the trust added, reduces the value of Manville
stock and therefore the trust's assets. The trust also said
that "no mismanagement has occurred nor is there an emergency
warranting the drastic measure of receivership as suggested
by the court," adding that only 8% of the money spent by the
trust has gone to pay its own costs and its attorney fees.
The rest -- about $750 million -- has gone or been earmarked
to pay claims. The judges will respond to the memorandum at a
hearing tomorrow.
   Manville executives and bankruptcy experts doubt that the
injunction will be overturned. Court-approved reorganization
plans are rarely modified, especially so late in the game.
Furthermore, says Richard Von Wald, Manville's general
counsel, "If the injunction is challenged, we'll all be
spending a lot of money on legal fees that should be going to
plaintiffs."
   The trust has already doled out to some 22,000 claimants
most of the $800 million-plus in cash it had when it started,
and it can't sell its common-stock holdings until year end.
It rejected as too low a company offer to buy back the
trust's preferred stock for $500 million; instead, the trust
plans to borrow assets to tide it over until Manville cash
starts flowing next year. Borrowing, however, has been made
more difficult by the New York judges' statements and the
publicity they received, the trust said in its memo to the
judges.
   "Everybody knew that we would have no income in 1990,"
says Marianna Smith, the trust's executive director.
"Everybody knew this was going to be troublesome."
   But some plaintiffs' attorneys think that the trust paid
out too much to early claimants -- the average settlement has
been about $42,000 -- and to attorneys. So far, 152,000
claims have been filed, and at least 3,000 more are expected.
With cash short, victims filing this year won't be paid until
2004, and lawyers are suing the trust rather than settling.
"That means the trust ends up spending more money on
litigation and less to pay claims," says Stanley J. Levy,
chairman of the plaintiffs' committee during the bankruptcy
proceedings and now a Manville director.
   Even before the New York judges' action, plaintiffs'
attorneys were contemplating a challenge to the bankruptcy
plan and to the injunction against suing Manville. "If
Manville has to put more of its profits into the trust, maybe
that's what has to happen," says Perry Weitz, an attorney
representing 2,000 asbestos claimants.
   Renegotiating the bankruptcy agreement would certainly
impede the ambitious plans Mr. Stephens started sketching
back in 1986, when he took command of the shattered company.
Although it was still solvent, the compounding liability risk
from asbestos-related lawsuits had driven Manville into
bankruptcy court in 1982. Manville sold its asbestos mines
and quit making asbestos products, which once produced nearly
half its operating profit.
   The company used its time in bankruptcy court to expand
its fiberglass operations and its 50%-owned platinum mine and
to absorb newly purchased Olinkraft Inc., a large
forest-products company. It also slashed its costs, shrinking
its payroll from 30,000 to 17,000, reducing the ranks of
senior vice presidents from 12 to five and trimming its jet
fleet from five planes to two. Nearly $500 million was sunk
into money-saving capital improvements, mostly to update
equipment. Employees pitched in: At one plant, maintenance
workers improved a wire mesh that controls the flow of
materials through a paper machine and saved $40,000 a month.
   Manville emerged from Chapter 11 late in 1988 and, for
1989, reported net income of $197 million -- its third
consecutive year of record earnings. And it has a $1 billion
war chest of cash and unused credit lines with which to
expand operations and buy new businesses. Already, the
forest-products group has acquired a beverage-carton business
in the U.S. and paper mills and corrugated paperboard plants
in Brazil as part of an ambitious plan to double its size in
five to seven years. The engineered-products group is
building a $65 million fiberglass plant in Waterville, Ohio.
   "This is a $2.2 billion company that has transformed
itself around new products and markets," says Mr. Kashnow,
the group's president.
   However, Manville still needs to modernize its plants.
Most of its fiberglass spinning plants, for instance, operate
on energy-gulping technology dropped by competitors 20 years
ago. The company will spend much of its 1990
capital-improvements budget of $300 million to upgrade those
facilities, Mr. Kashnow says.
   Meanwhile, Brazil's tough anti-inflation program is
squeezing profits at Manville's sizable forest-products and
corrugated-container operations there. New machines under
construction by U.S. and Canadian rivals threaten to flood
the U.S. paperboard market by early 1991, and continued
sluggishness in the construction and automobile markets will
limit 1990 earnings.
   The company also needs to regain the competitive edge it
lost while mired in bankruptcy court. "We'd lost good people,
customer support and new-product momentum," says Ronald
Mathewson, newly named president of Manville's building
products group. Mr. Mathewson's line of products, which once
numbered in the hundreds, has been reduced to non-asbestos
building insulation and roofing materials; the rest were sold
off. Now, he plans some aggressive buying.
   The new Ohio fiberglass plant illustrates Manville's hopes
and fears. Although the company expects to make up for lost
time with technology licensed from Nippon Electric Glass, Mr.
Kashnow acknowledges that major players such as Owens-Corning
Fiberglas Corp. and PPG Industries Inc. gained major
footholds while Manville was reorganizing. In
fiber-reinforced plastics -- the burgeoning business for
plastic clones to replace metal parts -- Manville must build
its business slowly, Mr. Kashnow says. He will concentrate on
market niches and custom applications, such as the emerging
air-filters market and the undeveloped fiberglass
wall-covering market, rather than challenge the leaders in
the $500 million commodity glass-fibers market.
   As Thomas Johnson, president of the forest-products unit,
puts it, Manville's cost-cutting efforts may have made it a
low-cost producer, but that "is simply the ante to play the
game. It doesn't guarantee you can stay in the game."
   So marketing also is under scrutiny. Mr. Mathewson of the
construction group notes, for example, that the same Manville
building-insulation salesmen now call on contractors at muddy
construction projects, buyers in retail home-improvement
centers and architects nestled in fancy design centers. "We
are a production-driven company. We don't think markets and
marketing," Mr. Mathewson admits.
   By September, he vows, that will change. A specialist will
advise retailers on ways to sell Manville insulation; another
will work with architects to get them to specify it. The
company's computer system is being reprogrammed to ask
questions more closely related to customer service. "For
example, it will focus on how many on-time deliveries we made
today instead of how many pieces did we produce," Mr.
Mathewson says.
   Despite such efforts, he acknowledges that the company is
struggling to regain lost business. "There were a lot of
customers who said, `I'll stick with you, but I can't let you
be my major supplier,'" he says. While Manville was mired in
the bankruptcy proceedings, Owens-Corning took the lead in
the retail insulation business through aggressive
advertising.
   Though not disclosing market shares, Mr. Mathewson says
some lost customers are returning. Payless Cashways Inc., a
retailer based in Kansas City, is in negotiations to restore
Manville as an insulation supplier. The chain, which now
carries only Owens-Corning products, dropped Manville six
years ago.
   Mr. Stephens expects old wounds to heal. "There were lots
of critics who said this company couldn't perform," he says.
"But $1 billion in claims have been settled and the plan is
working and the company is performing above expectations."
   Yet he concedes that the healing process will be lengthy.
"We're used to seeing unbelievable problems solved in 30
minutes," the length of an episode on TV, he complains. "It's
going to take far longer than 30 minutes to solve problems
that were years in the making."

   He warmed up with a bottle of beer, cleared his throat a
little and slowly headed to the stage. Not for him weeks of
rehearsals and endless caterwauling in the dressing room.
Intermissions he spent wondering where he might party
afterward. "The thought of a good meal after he'd finished
work incited him to his finest performances," recalled Frida
Leider, whose diet suffered whenever she sang Isolde to his
Tristan.
   And what performances. Lauritz Melchior (1890-1973) was
simply amazing. Melchior exhaling could make Brunnhilde's
battle gown billow at 20 paces. His tones were golden; his
declamation eloquent; his stamina astonishing. In the
Wagnerian repertoire nobody today can match him, old-timers
say, and they are right judging by Melchior's numerous
recordings and the pipsqueaks recently heard in the Met's
"Ring" cycle. Even the Melchior Foundation, which
periodically runs a heldentenor competition, has so far
failed to find a replacement for this most heroic tenor and
happy ham.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Just how Melchior got so big in so many ways is the story
told in Shirlee Emmons's "Tristanissimo" (Schirmer/Macmillan,
$24.95). It is a perfectly splendid biography, candid,
informed, amusing and, at 462 pages, appropriately scaled to
a giant who weighed in at 250 pounds in his lean years. "Like
a moving couch covered in red plush," commented Rudolf Bing,
after witnessing his Tannhauser. Bing, caustic and
"cadaverously thin," was not one to appreciate Melchior's ego
or his size, and though the tenor's voice was still strong,
he refused to re-engage him during his first season as
general manager of the Metropolitan Opera in 1950-51.
   "Tristanissimo" (the title comes from a sobriquet
superlative coined by Toscanini; another nickname was "Big
Noise") is as much a biography of the Danish tenor as it is a
history of changing opera traditions. Melchior was the
helmeted ornament of an era in which singers reigned supreme
and traveled with their favorite costumes and staging
notions. With Bing "Production Values had arrived . . . and
with them, the world of the director," writes Ms. Emmons.
   All Melchior asked in the way of a production was a table
that didn't collapse when he jumped on it to reach for the
sword in "Die Walkure." Mostly he was content to repeat the
gestures he had learned at Bayreuth, where he debuted in 1924
when Wagner's antique widow, Cosima, was still running the
shrine by remote control, conveying what she insisted were
the master's wishes to son Siegfried, who would then scurry
from her darkened box to the stage.
   Expressive eye movements executed in accordance with the
Cosima codex were a major part of the Bayreuth style, writes
Ms. Emmons: "(1) lids covering a major portion of the eyes,
which gazed onto the stage floor about five yards in front of
the performer; (2) eyes exposed normally, with the gaze
raised to eye level; and (3) eyelids drawn up as the eyes
widened in an expression of recognition, longing, or
fatigue." Unfortunately, critics insensitive to the master's
widow's wishes, often thought Melchior was just too lazy to
move.
   Big Noise stopped singing in Bayreuth in 1931 after the
widow died and Hitler became a favorite guest.
"Tristanissimo" is particularly interesting in its
descriptions of private lives impacted by politics and
finally war. At Covent Garden, Lotte Lehmann, a favorite
colleague and usually a cool cucumber, suddenly threw her
hands up in the middle of the first act of "Der
Rosenkavalier" saying, "I cannot go on." Her stepchildren
were at that moment illegally crossing the Austrian border.
   Germany's loss was America's gain. Melchior's career
boomed in the States, so much so that Kirsten Flagstad feuded
with him over first place. Kirsten, he would say, "the opera
is called `Tristan and Isolde' not `Tristan or Isolde.'"
   Melchior owed his immense popularity in no small part to
the constant efforts of his pretty, pushy second wife,
Kleinchen (Little One), and Constance Hope, a pioneer in
personal publicity. Years before Kathleen Battle plugged
Japanese Scotch for vast sums, Melchior cheerfully hustled
cigarettes. "I favor Lucky Strike for the sake of my throat,"
the cigar smoker declared for $7,000. Years before Luciano
Pavarotti bombed in Hollywood, Melchior made several silly
MGM movies -- which further disgusted Bing.
   No more serious offstage, the tenor sometimes entertained
luncheon guests wearing pajamas picked up in a store for the
full-figured woman -- or nothing at all. Cover up, darling,
Kleinchen would giggle, tossing a napkin. Such vignettes do
enliven a text. Now a voice teacher who sang with Big Noise
on his variety show in the 1950s, Ms. Emmons had access not
only to vast archives of Melchioriana (including diaries and
scrapbooks), but to the two appallingly mistreated children
from his first marriage. Ib and Birte pop up frequently in
the text, taking great pains to be fair, though the partly
Jewish daughter was left to fend for herself in Nazi-occupied
Denmark during the war and the son was blackballed at several
jobs by his stepmother. Only after Kleinchen's death did
Melchior finally repair his family ties.
   He never lost his appetite for fun and food. In a charming
foreword, Birgit Nilsson describes meeting Big Noise when he
was long retired from the Met, where she herself had sailed
into legend as Isolde in 1959. "What a wonderful couple we
would have made," he sighed, tucking her under an arm pit and
dragging her off to a groaning smorgasbord augmented by vast
quantities of pumpernickel bread slathered with goose fat and
peppered onion slices.

   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- First Connecticut Small Business
Investment Co., which lends to and invests in small-business
concerns, said it will omit its dividend indefinitely, citing
poor results and falling values in the New England real
estate that secures many of its loans.
   The quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents a share was last
paid Jan. 26. The company had a loss of $460,667, or 39 cents
a share, for its fourth quarter ended March 31, according to
David Engelson, president. For the fiscal year, First
Connecticut's earnings declined 42% to $1.2 million, or $1.05
a share, from a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Engelson said the dividend omission will help the
company conserve cash, but he emphasized that First
Connecticut remains "basically solid. We just want to see our
earnings before declaring a dividend." Dividend payments
amounted to about $1.1 million in fiscal 1990, and about $2.3
million in fiscal 1989, when an extra dividend of $1 was
paid, he said.
   First Connecticut shares plunged $1.875, to close at
$9.50, in American Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday.

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Wendy's International Inc. said its
restaurants are running better, its revamped menu is selling
better and its outlook is more optimistic than many analysts
think.
   Wendy's President and Chief Executive Officer James W.
Near said that analysts' second-quarter operating earnings
estimates of eight to 10 cents a share are "low" and that the
company will do "much better" in all of 1990 than last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   April sales were very strong, Mr. Near said; the trend
seemed to continue into May.
   Rumors have circulated that Wendy's may be a candidate for
takeover-rumors that the company won't address.
   Today, Shearson Lehman Hutton raised its earnings estimate
to 35 cents a share for 1990, rating Wendy's as likely to
outperform the market by 10 to 20 percentage points.
   The fast-food industry is emerging from a period of
discounting that swallowed profits as restaurants offered
coupons and other inducements to diners. Wendy's problems
were compounded by financial difficulties at some franchises.
   Mr. Near says Wendy's expanded too rapidly through the
early and mid-1980s, selling franchises to owners who wanted
the investment and not the work. The company has been atoning
for those errors by buying back ailing franchises.
   While the company was able to show improved net income for
1989, thanks to a five cent-a-share gain from an accounting
change and a two cent gain from early extinguishment of debt,
operating results eroded from 1988. Wendy's net from
operations last year was $23.7 million, or 25 cents a share,
down from $28.5 million, or 30 cents a share, in 1988.
Revenue increased slightly to $1.07 billion, from $1.06
billion in 1988.
   Wendy's revenue fell in the first quarter of 1990 to
$241.3 million, from $259.5 million a year ago. Operating
profit increased to $3 million, from $814,000 in the 1989
first quarter. The 1990 quarter included a $499,000, or
one-cent-a-share, gain on extinguishment of debt for net
income of $3.5 million, or four cents a share. The 1989
quarter included $339,000 from extinguishment of debt and
$5.2 million, or six cents a share, from an accounting
adjustment for net income of $6.3 million, or seven cents a
share.

   Bally Offers Exchange
   Of Over 20% Stake
   To Retire Junk Bonds

   CHICAGO -- Bally Manufacturing Corp. offered to exchange a
more than 20% stake in the gambling and health-club concern
to retire a four-year-old, $135 million issue of junk bonds.
   The move is what Bally called a "first step" toward
shoring up its heavily leveraged balance sheet and improving
its stock price. Bally said it also is considering a variety
of asset sales, refinancings, joint ventures and other
measures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bonds, sold through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
January 1986, have been trading at about 53 cents to 55 cents
on the dollar, Paul Johnson, Bally's chief financial officer,
said. Bally offered 57 shares of its common stock for each
$1,000 bond, or a total of about 7.7 million newly issued
shares if all the bonds are tendered. The company currently
has about 28 million shares outstanding.
   Bally's stock tumbled $1.50 yesterday on the news to close
at $10.625 in Big Board trading.
   Despite greatly increasingly the number of shares
outstanding, Bally said the equity-for-debt swap would
increase per-share profit by reducing the company's debt
load. The bonds, due January 2001, pay 13 5/8% interest, and
are the company's costliest debt.
   Bally had first-quarter profit of $7.6 million, or 21
cents a share, compared with $11.8 million, or 37 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue was $551.3 million compared
with $516.7 million. The company wouldn't project future 1990
results or say how much per-share net would be increased by
the exchange.
   In all, Bally has about $1.77 billion of long-term debt,
Mr. Johnson said, and its 1989 interest expense was $206
million. "The market perception is that we had too much
debt," he said.
   Bally joins some other junk-bond issuers in trying to buy
back its debt at a deep discount to the original price. Mr.
Johnson said, however, that since the company is under no
financial pressure to retire the bonds, it wouldn't sweeten
the offer. "It's terribly unlikely we would do anything
else," he said.

   Suzuki Motor Co. of Japan reported that consolidated
pretax profit for the year ended March 31 rose 76% to 25.48
billion yen ($168.7 million) from 14.48 billion yen a year
earlier, after the company limited growth in manufacturing
and administration costs.
   But net income fell 14% to 5.61 billion yen, or 13.75 yen
a share, from 6.54 billion yen, or 17.38 yen a share, because
of higher tax payments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales of Suzuki vehicles and parts rose 2.3% to 982.57
billion yen from 960.49 billion yen. Costs increased only
0.4% for sales and 1.9% for administration, allowing
operating profit to surge from a year earlier. A Suzuki
official attributed the slower growth of costs to
exchange-rate factors, as well as changes in Japan's tax
system.
   Receipts from auto sales slipped 0.7% to 617.06 billion
yen from 621.66 billion yen. Motorcycle sales inched up 0.6%
to 148.266 billion yen from 147.384 billion yen. Parts sales
rose 13% to 217.247 billion yen from 191.45 billion yen.
Vehicle volume sagged in every area but sales of motorcycles
overseas; unit sales fell 2.2% for motorcycles and 6.6% for
autos.

   Phoenix Technologies Ltd. said 14 personal computer makers

new strength for the EISA computer communications standard
over International Business Machines Corp.'s MCA design.
   EISA, which stands for extended industry-standard
architecture, was developed last year by a group of PC makers
led by Compaq Computer Corp. to counter IBM's effort to push
a new standard that wasn't compatible with existing PCs. IBM
says its MCA -- or micro-channel architecture -- design
allows faster data exchange within and among its computers.
</LP>

   In a statement, Ron Fisher, president and chief executive
officer of the Norwood, Mass., company, said, "We continue to
see a groundswell of development activity on the EISA"
design. Phoenix, which sells system software that allows PC
makers to build IBM-compatible computers, said its EISA
products are made for PCs using Intel Corp. 80386 and 80486
chips.
   Companies licensing the EISA compatibility products from
Phoenix include Intel, NEC Corp., Tandy Corp. and Altos

   Chrysler Corp. will reduce the cash it offers consumers on
at least three of its car lines, when it renews its buyer
incentive program this week.
   A spokesman confirmed that the Highland Park, Mich., auto
maker will reduce to $750 from $1,000 the rebate to buyers of
its Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance compact cars; its
Chrysler LeBaron line; and its Dodge Spirit and Plymouth
Acclaim midsized cars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler officials attributed the reduced incentives to
stronger sales and lower stocks of the cars. Sales of the
Spirit and Acclaim vehicles this year through May 20 rose 34%
from a year earlier, Chrysler said. Inventories of the cars
represent about a 50-day supply, relatively low for the
industry. Chrysler said its aggressive sales campaign, which
compares the cars directly to those built by Japan-based auto
makers, has helped boost sales.
   Chrysler isn't the only auto maker to cut incentives
recently. Ford Motor Co. this month reduced its cash
incentives on some of its more popular models.

   After Haloid {Xerox's predecessor} acquired the rights to
xerography, the company set forth on its mission to develop
the invention, and to explore and fulfill its promise. The
crucial fact is that it took 14 years between the time Haloid
obtained the first license on the Carlson patents and the
successful introduction of the first truly commercial
product, the Xerox 914. They were years of anguish,
uncertainty, disappointment, frustration and only occasional
satisfaction during which we were never entirely sure that
xerography would ever be a success. It took truly tenacious
commitment to bring it all to pass.
   How did it happen? I think there were several qualities
that gave Haloid and later Xerox its special character.
   First, there was faith in the idea. From the beginning
there was a belief in this untried, uncertain and still
largely ephemeral concept about which many more sophisticated
companies had misgivings. It took faith -- and some
foolhardiness -- to pursue xerography with such commitment
when we knew that other, more knowledgeable, experienced and
competent companies had looked at and turned down. . . .
   A second essential characteristic of the company was its
enthusiasm -- a kind of corporate contagious enthusiasm about
what was being done and what might yet be done. From the
beginning there was a feeling of excitement which permeated
Xerox. . . .
   Third, there was a sense of idealism. We saw xerography as
far more than a way to make better copies. We sensed not only
a copying revolution but also the nascent information
revolution. . . .
   None of this could have happened without our antitrust
laws and the patent system which provided the incentive for
investment in an uncertain technology of potential value.
   The protection provided by the patent laws enabled the
international licensing and marketing of a technology that
has brought benefits to the world and continues to reward
improvement in xerographic processing.

   Law:
   Caller ID Service Barred by Pennsylvania Appeals Court
   ----

<LP>
   A Pennsylvania appeals court barred Bell of Pennsylvania's
Caller ID service, saying it violates the state's wiretap law
and constitutional right to privacy.
   In a ruling with nationwide implications, the court
overturned a November decision by the state Public Utilities
Commission that allowed the Bell Atlantic Corp. unit to offer
the service. Caller ID permits customers to identify the
telephone number of incoming calls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled 5-0 that the
service violates the state wiretap law's provision banning
trap and trace devices and split 3-2 on the issue of
violating privacy rights. The court took a hard line, ruling
that the service was illegal whether or not the phone company
allowed customers to block the transmission of their phone
numbers.
   The company said it was "extremely disappointed" and
indicated it would appeal. "We will carefully study this
ruling before deciding our next action, but a clear option is
to ask for judicial review by the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania," said Bill Harral, vice president, external
affairs, for Bell of Pennsylvania. In banning the service
even if customers were allowed to block their numbers, the
court went beyond what opponents had sought, the company
complained.
   The suit was filed against the commission by the state
Consumer Advocates' office, the Pennsylvania Coalition
Against Domestic Violence, the American Civil Liberties Union
and the Consumer Education and Protective Association.
   "We're gratified, of course," said Daniel Clearfield,
Pennsylvania's senior assistant consumer advocate. "This
affirms consumers' right to control the disclosure of
personal information, a fact that was forgotten by the phone
company."
   In its 23-page ruling, the court said that neither the
device that lets customers see the phone number of people
calling or the information that is collected is "controlled
or maintained by Bell but rather by the customer subscriber,
clearly violating the trap and trace device prohibition."
   The issues raised by the Pennsylvania case are likely to
be repeated as phone companies roll out Caller ID services
across the country. Privacy rights, said Mr. Clearfield, "are
very carefully protected in our society, and once courts
begin to take a hard look at Caller ID, they will see through
the phone company line that the service enhances privacy."
   So far, Bell Atlantic has been the most aggressive of the
seven regional Bell companies in introducing the service,
having begun offering it more than two years ago in New
Jersey. Bell Atlantic units also offer Caller ID service in
Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. The company has
promoted Caller ID as a guard against harassing or obscene
calls, and claims that most Caller ID subscribers have
unlisted numbers and want the service to further protect
their privacy.
   A Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman acknowledged that the
ruling "could lead to other states looking at this and
concluding that they need to take a closer look at Caller ID.
But frankly, I don't think this story is completed." Caller
ID proposals have generated intense debate in several states,
including California, Nevada, Ohio, Indiana, and in the
District of Columbia. In California, the issue was resolved
by a new law that allows customers to block the transmission
of their number on a call-by-call basis.
   Bell of Pennsylvania has been providing Caller ID in
Pennsylvania on a limited basis to police and ambulance
services as a cheaper alternative to 911 service, a spokesman
said. The company's plan to offer it to customers in
Philadelphia and Harrisburg was blocked until the case was
decided.
   The issue has made its way to Congress, where Sen. Herbert
Kohl (D., Wis.) is pushing a bill that would require phone
companies to block the transmission of numbers at customers'
request. The bill is scheduled for a committee markup next
week.
   Among consumer advocates and privacy experts, the court
decision was viewed as an important first step. They worry
that Caller ID violates callers' expectations that their
number is private. Many contend the service could increase
telemarketing and other sales calls and threatens the
effectiveness of hotlines, tip lines for law enforcement
agencies, shelters for battered women and other community
services that depend on maintaining a caller's anonymity.
   "The state court reaffirmed a central principle that the
phone subscriber -- not the phone company -- should decide
when to disclose phone numbers," said Marc Rotenberg, head of
the Washington office of Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility.

   NEW YORK -- Populist Boris Yeltsin's election as president
of the Soviet Union's Russian Republic and expected wrangling
at the Bush-Gorbachev summit over the military status of a
unified Germany highlighted underlying nervousness about
German unification yesterday, driving the mark broadly lower.
   The mark dropped almost a pfennig against the dollar and
slipped about a third of a yen after rallying against both
currencies on Tuesday. The pound, bolstered by British
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's remarks supporting
continued high interest rates, rose about 1 1/2 pfennigs
against the mark.

   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6830 marks, up from 1.6740 marks late Tuesday, and at
151.45 yen, up from 151.25 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6950, up from $1.6940 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 151.62 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
150.75 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.6830 marks.
   The mark's decline came despite a steady stream of
positive-sounding statements about unification by West German
monetary authorities and news that the West German
cost-of-living index rose a preliminary 0.2% in May.
   Anticipation of a moderate cost-of-living figure had
helped the West German currency post gains Tuesday, and past
remarks by West German authorities suggesting that the
process of unification is well in hand have helped boost the
mark.
   But both the inflation news and the remarks on unification
were overshadowed yesterday by a burst of pessimism about the
chances for a smooth transition to one Germany, participants
said.
   The closer unification gets, the more "people are wary,"
said Jack Griffin, a vice president and corporate trader at
Banque Indosuez in New York.
   The election of the maverick Yeltsin to the presidency of
the huge Russian Republic added to traders' nervousness
because he is seen as a rival to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and possibly a further destabilizing influence
within the already tumultuous Soviet political scene. Mr.
Gorbachev recently has been widely perceived as having
political trouble at home despite successes overseas.
   The issue of a united Germany's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization is likely to be discussed at the
U.S.-Soviet summit meeting that begins today in Washington.
Market participants will watch the summit carefully because
the two sides may find it difficult to compromise on that
issue, traders said.
   Chief among the slew of statements by West German
officials yesterday was Bundesbank President Karl Otto
Poehl's remark that the central bank is "very satisfied" with
the state treaty between East and West Germany on economic
and social unification. Rumors of a split between the
Bundesbank and government over the treaty had been weighing
on the West German currency recently, and the mark enjoyed a
slight rebound against the dollar after news of the comment
at midafternoon New York time, but soon lost its gain on
continued selling.
   Earlier, Bundesbank directorate member Hans Tietmeyer said
there is no extreme threat of inflation in West Germany due
to unification, a comment supported from the government side
by Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, who said that the
central bank will take appropriate action to keep West German
inflation below a 3% annual rate after July 2, when the
treaty on unification takes effect.
   Mr. Griffin of Banque Indosuez noted that the potential
impact of the statements by West German officials was diluted
by the perception that the remarks were politically motivated
as different forces within West Germany jockey for position
before unification and coming national elections.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery
next month settled at $364.10 an ounce, down $3.30. Estimated
volume was a heavy six million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $364.45 an
ounce.

   Lotus Development Corp. said it acquired the AlphaWorks
integrated software package from Alpha Software Corp. and
will market the package as LotusWorks. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The software, which provides word processing, data
management, financial analysis and communications functions
in a single package, competes with Microsoft Corp.'s popular
Microsoft Works product.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The purchase strengthens the Cambridge, Mass., company in
the entry-level segment of the market for integrated
software. Its Symphony product is aimed at high-end
customers, but that market isn't growing as fast. Symphony
sells for $695, while LotusWorks will sell for $149.
   Alpha Software says it has shipped more than 300,000
copies of AlphaWorks since its first version was introduced
in 1983. The program has been well-received by reviewers and
software experts.
   Lotus also said it has struck agreements with several
personal computer manufacturers, including Olivetti Office
USA, Packard Bell and Poquet Corp., which will sell the
product bundled with some PCs.

   ATLANTA -- Home Depot Inc., which has seen its shares'
market value soar 20% since early May, declared a 3-for-2
stock split and effectively boosted its dividend rate 50% by
maintaining the payout at three cents a share on a post-split
basis.
   The highflying building-materials and home-improvement
company said its board made the decisions at a session after
the annual meeting yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We had a long discussion about it and decided it was the
right thing to do," Ronald M. Brill, senior vice president
and chief financial officer, said, pointing to strong
earnings and a recent surge in the company's share price. "We
want the shares to be more affordable on a per-share basis to
our customers and employees -- to the retail (stock)
purchasers."
   Home Depot's first-quarter net income rose 49% to $38.6
million, or 48 cents a share, from $25.9 million, or 33 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales jumped 37% to $880.9 million
from $641.5 million. The company this year has opened seven
new stores, increasing its total to 125.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Home Depot shares closed at $59.875, up 37.5 cents.
   Home Depot said it would accomplish the stock split by
issuing one-half common share for each share held, payable
July 6 to stock of record June 14. It said that after the
split, its quarterly dividend of three cents a share will be
paid Aug. 3 to stock of record July 20.
   The company has about 77 million shares outstanding. At
the meeting, shareholders approved a measure increasing the
number of authorized shares to 250 million from 100 million.

   Business Brief -- Quantum Corp.:
   Western Digital Will Pay
   $4 Million to Settle Lawsuit

   Quantum Corp., a Milpitas, Calif., maker of hard-disk
drives for personal computers, said it has settled a patent
infringement suit that it filed against Western Digital Corp.
in 1988. As part of the agreement, Western Digital, Irvine,
Calif., said it will pay Quantum $4 million.
   The suit charged that certain disk drive products that
Western Digital acquired from Tandon Corp. in 1988 infringed
on patents covering Quantum's wedge-servo architecture and
the popular Hardcard disk drives made by Quantum's
subsidiary, Plus Development Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Western Digital said it stopped making the contested
drives that use wedge-servo architecture at the end of last
year. It said it agreed, as part of the settlement, to
sharply limit production of its version of Quantum's
Hardcard, which Western Digital calls FileCard, by Jan. 1,
1991.
   A company with a reputation for zealously guarding its
patents, Quantum has successfully waged patent wars against
several rivals. In recent years, it has won $6 million from
Computer Memories Inc. and $3 million from Japan's NEC Corp.
Last year, it escalated a legal feud with Sony Corp., filing
a federal lawsuit that accused the Japanese firm of patent
violations and unfair business practices.

   Future Cloudy For
   $1 Billion Supercollider Plea

   TOKYO -- U.S. government officials from four executive
agencies and one congressional committee arrived here this
week bearing a letter from President Bush to Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu.
   Their mission: to coax roughly $1 billion from Japan for
the superconducting supercollider to be built in Texas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Their pitch is becoming more common. Big basic-science
projects are getting more expensive. The U.S. government is
financially pinched. And there is growing sentiment that
Japan should share more of its wealth -- particularly because
it has benefited greatly from relatively free access to
Western basic research.
   In February U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pressed
Japan to share more of its military technology, noting that
"Japan and other allies have long benefited from technology
flow from the United States." Japan is also likely to get
requests as Americans raise funds for other megaprojects such
as an advanced fusion reactor and a manned journey to Mars.
   But such pleas, at least in the short term, will likely go
unfulfilled, further fraying bilateral relations. Japanese
officials say they agree in general with foreign demands, but
Japanese science policy-making works against major spending
on basic research.
   That stance already is creating problems. Last year,
prominent American biologists, led by Nobel laureate James D.
Watson, lambasted Japan on Capitol Hill for foot-dragging in
supporting a multibillion-dollar effort to map the human
genetic system. "The days when the United States can
effectively subsidize Japanese science are over," Mr. Watson
wrote to a Japanese colleague.
   The supercollider, scheduled for completion by 1998, is
supposed to push particle physics to unprecedented energy
levels, giving new insights into the basic laws of matter.
The U.S. government is planning to underwrite $5 billion of
the $8 billion price tag, with the state of Texas chipping in
another billion dollars. American officials are now tapping
other sources to meet the total. Japan is their first stop.
   U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore, the leader
of this week's delegation, said at a press luncheon here
yesterday that the government is approaching Japan because of
its advanced work in physics. He refused to say publicly how
much support he seeks from the Japanese, but several members
of the delegation put the figure at $1 billion. Mr. Moore
stressed that Japan is being approached as a potential
partner -- participating in designing and constructing the
project -- not just as a financier. He said he will also
discuss the issue with other countries, starting with South
Korea next week.
   Other officials say the U.S. expects Japan in particular
to play a greater role. In bilateral discussions in
Washington at the beginning of May, "there was a general
agreement that greater cooperation was needed in basic
science in general and in the megaprojects in particular," J.
Thomas Ratchford, associate director of the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy, said publicly.
   By its own admission, Japan is a relative laggard in
fundamental scientific research. Research-and-development
spending by the government, the main source of basic research
funds, is less than 0.5% of Japan's gross national product,
compared with more than 1% in the U.S., West Germany, and
France.
   Two weeks ago, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry issued a report calling for Japan to increase
government funding to 1% of GNP by the year 2000. "Until now,
we haven't placed emphasis on basic, or creative R&amp;D work,"
said Yukio Honda, director of the technology policy planning
division at MITI's Agency of Industrial Science and
Technology.
   Japan is already contributing somewhat more to
international projects. It is helping build, along with
Europe, a part of the U.S.-sponsored space station. "The
trend is toward convergence" in basic research spending by
Japan and the U.S., Mr. Ratchford noted. But it will be a
difficult battle before Japan reaches parity. The Ministry of
Finance opposes any increase in the national budget. And
Japan's policymaking, particularly in science, is divided
among several bureaucracies that rarely agree.
   "Everybody feels we have to contribute something on these
international matters," says Genya Chiba, vice president of
the government-sponsored Research &amp; Development Corp. of
Japan and a major proponent of more basic research. "But I
don't know how. Which ministry, which department is
responsible for that? A consensus hasn't been formed."

   In another move to reduce its debt, the Anglo-American

to sell its European cosmetics businesses to closely held
Joh. A. Benckiser G.m.b.H. of West Germany, a household

   The sale, which requires West German government approval,
involves the Margaret Astor and Lancaster businesses, which
had 1989 sales of #264 million; the rights to several
designer brands, and manufacturing facilities in West
Germany, France and Spain. Benckiser's payment will be made
in at least two installments, the first for about #176
million on completion of the sale, expected in about a month.
SmithKline said the deal brings to #701 million the sum it
has raised in its continuing program of selling assets.

   Benckiser said the acquisition will boost its 1990 sales
more than 50% to 3.4 billion marks ($2.03 billion). The
purchase, Benckiser's first in the cosmetics industry, also
marks its second deal with SmithKline; in December, it bought
the U.S.-based Household Products operations for #66 million.

   Feeling Pinch,
   William Farley
   May Accept Bid

   Outside Investors May Seek
   To Buy Majority Stake
   In West Point-Pepperell

   CHICAGO -- Several outside investors are considering
buying a majority stake in West Point-Pepperell Inc. from
cash-strapped owner William Farley, according to people on
Wall Street.
   Mr. Farley, who can't complete his $1.56 billion tender
offer because he lacks the funds to buy the remaining 5% of
West Point-Pepperell shares outstanding, may reluctantly
accept such a bid, people close to the transaction indicated.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The investor may need a suitor with deep pockets to help
him complete the transaction.
   Officials at Farley Inc., the closely held manufacturing
concern and umbrella company for the investor's business
empire, declined to comment.
   Among the possible bidders mentioned by sources are two
New York investment concerns: Coniston Partners and
Blackstone Group. A Coniston official declined to comment on
the rumors, and Blackstone officials didn't return telephone
calls.
   One other investment concern rumored as a possible bidder,
Henley Group of New York, also declined comment. But a Henley
official said he previously expressed interest in West
Point-Pepperell to certain of Mr. Farley's bankers. The
official, who requested anonymity, said the inquiry fell
short of formal talks, however, and he added that he is no
longer interested. He wouldn't elaborate.
   People close to the West Point-Pepperell situation said
Mr. Farley may be receptive to an offer couched as a joint
venture -- one that repays much of his estimated $200 million
equity stake in the big West Point, Ga., textile concern.
   Pressure on Mr. Farley to accept such an offer, should one
come, is mounting. As reported, he may soon have to battle
his bondholders over voting control of West Point-Pepperell.
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., financial adviser to some of Mr.
Farley's bondholders, suggested to its clients last week that
they seek voting control, according to a person close to
those discussions.
   Troubles worsened for Mr. Farley and his creditors in
March when West Point Acquisition Corp., the unit he set up
to buy West Point-Pepperell, fell into default on $796
million in bank debt and missed bondholder interest payments.
   Last month, Mr. Farley offered to surrender majority
ownership of West Point-Pepperell, which he fought so hard to
win in a takeover battle last year. That offer would leave
Mr. Farley in control of West Point, however, through his
ownerhsip of a series of so-called super-voting privilege
common shares, people close to the situation said.
   But a new West Point suitor would presumably want to
acquire at least 51% of the common stock and control of the
super-voting shares, sources said. Such a bid would probably
include an offer to buy the bonds of certain of Mr. Farley's
debtholders at a sizable discount. But the bondholders might
find such a proposal attractive, now that Mr. Farley is in
default to them. The various issues of bonds held by Mr.
Farley's creditors have been trading in the range of 10 cents
to 35 cents on the dollar in recent weeks.
   People close to the West Point-Pepperell transaction said
a suitor may be welcomed by Mr. Farley's bankers, led by
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co. He's about $83
million short of the cash needed to acquire the remaining 5%
of the West Point-Pepperell, and his debt restrictions won't
let him tap into its cash reserve to help pay interest on his
various loans unless the transaction is completed.
   While rumors of a possible outside bidder sparked interest
in bond-trading circles, there isn't much incentive for
prospective bidders to move fast: Mr. Farley's weak financial
condition may merely serve to make any bidder's position
stronger later.
   Mr. Farley's financial strength ebbed earlier this year
with the collapse of his investment banker, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. His Farley Inc. had a pretax loss of about $40
million in 1989, analysts estimated.

   Who's News:
   Quebec Seen Naming Delorme Chairman
   Of Caisse de Depot Pension-Fund Agency
   ----

<LP>
   MONTREAL -- The Quebec government will name Jean-Claude
Delorme, a veteran telecommunications executive, chairman of
Caisse de Depot et Placement, the government's powerful
pension-fund agency, according to people familiar with the
appointment.
   The announcement, expected tomorrow, will end months of
speculation in Quebec business circles. Caisse de Depot,
which is both feared for its power and revered as a concrete
example of French-speaking Quebecers' growing economic clout,
manages 34.2 billion Canadian dollars (US$29 billion) in
assets and is one of the biggest players in Canadian
financial markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Mr. Delorme has accepted the post," said Claude Gareau,
an associate at Heidrick Struggles Woods Gordon Inc., the
executive search concern that conducted the hunt for a new
chairman.
   Chairman Jean Campeau (no relation to the Toronto
businessman Robert Campeau) transformed the once sleepy
Caisse de Depot into an investment powerhouse during his two
five-year terms, the second of which expired in March. Mr.
Campeau, 58 years old, agreed to stay on for a few months,
but never said whether he was seeking reappointment to
another term. Under his hands-on direction, Caisse de Depot
has consistently beaten broad measures of Canadian stock and
bond market performance in recent years. Last year, the
agency's stock portfolio had a total return of 22.7%,
compared with 21.4% for the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index.
Caisse de Depot's bond portfolio had a return of 14.6% last
year, compared with 12.8% for a reference index compiled by a
Toronto brokerage house.
   Mr. Delorme is president and chief executive officer of
the Teleglobe Canada Inc. unit of Memotec Data Inc., a
Montreal-based telecommunications and communications
equipment concern. Teleglobe provides overseas communications
services for Canadian telephone companies, and was formerly
owned by the Canadian government.
   Neither Mr. Delorme nor Mr. Campeau was available to
comment.
   "I think Mr. Delorme has ideal qualifications" for the
Caisse de Depot post, said H. Arnold Steinberg, a Memotec
director who first met Mr. Delorme in the 1960s. Mr. Delorme
"is highly regarded throughout the (Quebec) business
community," Mr. Steinberg said.
   The appointment of Mr. Delorme, who is viewed as a
diplomatic executive with broad experience dealing with
governments, is also a sign Caisse de Depot will make more
investments outside Canada, said a person familiar with the
situation. As president of Teleglobe, Mr. Delorme deals with
dozens of foreign governments and companies.
   Mr. Delorme also is expected to tone down Caisse de
Depot's reputation as an aggressive investor that always
likes to get its own way. "I don't think he'll beat up on you
in the corner," said a Montreal investment banker, adding
somewhat wistfully that Mr. Delorme "probably won't be as
exciting as Jean Campeau."
   Though widely praised for its investment performance,
Caisse de Depot is privately criticized for taking too active
a role at small and medium-sized Quebec companies in which it
holds significant stakes. "I think if you took a poll of
those Quebec companies, people would say, `We regret taking
in Caisse de Depot as a partner,'" the investment banker
said.
   Public criticism of the agency, no matter how polite, is
almost unheard of in Quebec. "It's like handling dynamite for
me to talk about it," a Montreal financial analyst said.
   Earlier this year, the entrepreneur Marcel Dutil paused at
the end of a speech here to take a polite shot at Caisse de
Depot. All conversation stopped. The financial analysts and
business people in the audience looked around uneasily, as
though they expected lightning to flash down from the ceiling
of the hotel ballroom and strike Mr. Dutil dead. Nothing
happened. Relieved, people applauded and smiled, as Mr. Dutil
continued his very mild critique.
   Outside the province, Caisse de Depot attracts attention
for its apparent Quebec nationalism. Last year, Caisse de
Depot helped tiny Socanav Inc., a Montreal shipping concern,
take over Steinberg Inc., a big grocery concern based here.
Socanav's winning C$1.33 billion bid, with Caisse de Depot as
a partner, beat out a competing bid by a Toronto group.
Caisse de Depot "makes princes out of princelings," an
executive at a Montreal brokerage firm said.
   Mindful of criticism that Mr. Campeau, who also has the
title of general manager, wields too much power at Caisse de
Depot, the government is expected to create a new position,
chief of operations. According to people familiar with the
situation, Guy Savard, a Sherbrooke, Quebec, accountant, will
be named to the new post. Mr. Savard also is a fund-raiser
for the governing Liberal Party. His appointment is seen as
less than certain. A Caisse de Depot executive said the
agency's managers "were very surprised" and are "worried" by
Mr. Savard's expected appointment. Mr. Savard couldn't be
reached to comment.
   According to local reports that couldn't be confirmed, Mr.
Campeau will be named chairman of Domtar Inc., a
Montreal-based forest products company. Caisse de Depot and
another Quebec government agency hold a controlling stake in
Domtar, which declined to comment on the reports.

   Meyer Emerges
   As Chief Contender
   For Harvard Post

   NEW YORK -- Jack R. Meyer, treasurer of the Rockefeller
Foundation, emerged as the leading candidate to head Harvard
University's $5 billion endowment, people familiar with the
university said.
   The search to find a new president for the Harvard
Management Co., Harvard's investment arm, neared a conclusion
this week as the management company's board met on the issue.
People familiar with the situation said a formal announcement
of the choice is expected soon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Meyer, a 1969 graduate of the Harvard Business School,
declined to comment.
   The presidency of Harvard Management is considered one of
the premier jobs in the money-management business. In
addition to handling the nation's largest private university
endowment, Harvard Management has gained prestige in the
investment world as an early and large investor in such areas
as venture capital, oil and gas properties and leveraged
buy-outs.
   While Mr. Meyer already holds a top investment job at the
Rockefeller Foundation, a move to Harvard would be a major
step up. Rockefeller Foundation has about $2 billion in
assets and relies heavily on outside money managers to handle
its investments. Harvard Management, on the other hand, is a
much larger organization, with a staff of about 115 people,
and manages many of its investments directly.
   Harvard has been looking for a new endowment head since
January, when the university announced that Walter Cabot, the
only president of Harvard Management since it was set up in
1974, was stepping down, following a 1989 heart attack.
   Finding a replacement for Mr. Cabot is believed to have
been a priority for Harvard University President Derek Bok,
who announced Tuesday that he planned to leave his post at
the end of the next academic year. A Harvard spokesman said
yesterday he wasn't aware of any announcement plans regarding
Mr. Cabot's replacement.
   The selection of Mr. Meyer would be "a superb choice,"
said David Swensen, director of investments for the Yale
University endowment. "He's one of the most impressive
institutional fund managers I've ever met," Mr. Swensen said.

   MADRID -- Spain's current international payments account
deficit widened sharply in April to 155.3 billion pesetas
($1.49 billion) from 81.1 billion pesetas a year earlier, the
Bank of Spain reported.
   The central bank said a sharp drop in foreign capital
investment, which fell to 84 billion pesetas from 193 billion
pesetas in April 1989, was the major reason for the marked
deterioration in the current account deficit. The current
account includes trade in goods and services, plus some
unilateral transfers.

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices inched higher again in light
trading activity as investors continued to mark time ahead of
two key economic reports due out tomorrow.
   The most important of the two indicators is the May
employment report, which is anxiously awaited because it will
provide the first official reading on how the economy
performed this month. The findings in the report are expected
to set the tone in the bond market for the next several
weeks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "People are not willing to speculate in the bond market
with a report of such importance coming out," said Michael
Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
   Also due tomorrow is the May survey of the nation's
purchasing agents. Dealers and analysts said indications of a
sluggish economy in data issued yesterday morning on April
leading indicators and new home sales helped to buoy bond
prices.
   "The data that came out this morning were positive, and
that set the tone for trading during the day," said Brian
Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montague Securities Inc.
Leading indicators fell 0.2% last month, which was in line
with market forecasts. New home sales fell more than expected
to their weakest pace since December 1982.
   Sales of new single-family houses fell 1.6% in April to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546,000, the Commerce
Department said.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 1/4 point
higher, or up $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its
price, eased slightly to 8.59%.
   The highlight of an otherwise dull session was the Federal
Reserve's purchase of an estimated $3.5 billion to $4 billion
of Treasury bills for its own account in an infrequent
operation known as a bill pass.
   The Fed's action, which added reserves to the banking
system, had only a small impact on bond prices because it was
viewed as technical in nature.
   "The action meets a seasonal need for increased reserves
and has no monetary policy significance," said Louis
Crandall, an economist with R.H. Wrightson &amp; Associates.
   The Fed's bill pass did push Treasury bill rates lower
because it helped to sop up some of the new supply in the
short end of the market, analysts said.
   In addition to yesterday's sale of $12 billion of
cash-management bills, the Treasury will sell $10 billion of
52-week bills today and a record $17.2 billion of three-month
and six-month bills Monday.
   The bill pass "helped to relieve some of the congestion in
the bill market," said Mr. Moran. Also in the short end of
the market, the federal funds rate fell to 7%, well below the
8 1/4% perceived target.
   However, the softness in the funds rate, which banks
charge each other on overnight loans, had little effect on
the market because it was attributed to yesterday being the
final day of a two-week statement period, when funds often
fluctuate widely as banks adjust their reserve positions.
   Traders said that apprehension about tomorrow's data was
reflected in rumors circulating in the bond market that the
index of the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago,
due to be released today at 10 a.m. EDT, would show a strong
rebound in that region's manufacturing sector.
   The Chicago survey is closely watched by the bond market
because many players believe it can provide an early reading
of the national survey, due tomorrow.
   However, the composite diffusion index of the National
Association of Purchasing Management is expected to have
declined to 49.5% in May, according to the average of
estimates of 10 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital
Markets Report.
   In April, the index was pegged at 50.2%, the first time in
a year that it was above the 50% level. A reading above 50%
indicates an expanding industrial sector, and a reading below
50% suggests the sector is contracting.
   Elsewhere, employment growth is expected to have picked up
considerably in May, with nonfarm payrolls expected to have
increased 253,000, with a gain of 135,000 seen if newly hired
census workers are excluded, according to a Capital Markets
Report survey of 20 economists.
   In the month, the civilian unemployment rate is expected
to have been unchanged at 5.4%. The jobless rate rose 0.2
percentage point in April.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Investors willing to gamble to get high yields went flying
after a $201 million special project revenue bond issue by
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   Yields on the bonds, sold on behalf of Continental and
Eastern airlines, topped 9%, about two percentage points
higher than the average municipal bond. The new bonds posted
the highest yields seen on a municipal issue in almost three
years.
   The yields were high because the bonds aren't rated and
aren't obligations of the Port Authority, which means the
authority is under no responsibility to repay the bonds if
the airlines default on the debt.
   The bonds, which are subject to alternative minimum tax,
fall into the "speculative" category, which means they are
essentially municipal junk bonds.
   Although Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., is
modestly profitable, Eastern is operating under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code. Eastern, a former Texas Air
unit, has been put in the hands of a trustee by the
bankruptcy court.
   Despite these facts, underwriters led by Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. said the bonds drew strong demand from
institutional and high net-worth individual retail investors.
   The bonds were priced to yield from 9.38% for bonds that
mature in 2005 to 9.63% for bonds that mature in 2015. In
comparison, the Bond Buyer municipal bond index yielded 7.62%
yesterday.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used to build a new 10-gate
passenger terminal at La Guardia Airport in New York.
   Traders say Continental, based on its own credit, would
have to pay exorbitantly high yields to do this type of
unsecured bond deal in the corporate market. Also, this type
of special project financing is usually done in the municipal
market. Continental's corporate junk bonds generally yield
between 17% and 19%.
   Meanwhile, most actively traded municipal bonds ended
between 1/8 and 1/4 point higher. New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% bonds due in 2018 rose 1/8 point to 98 bid
to yield 7.36%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of a Bally Manufacturing Corp. subsidiary
surged on news that the company is launching an exchange
offer that analysts called favorable to bondholders.
   Bally Health &amp; Tennis's 13 5/8% senior subordinated
debentures rocketed five points to finish the session at 58.
   Under terms of the exchange offer, each holder of Bally
Health &amp; Tennis 13 5/8% subordinated debentures will receive
57 shares of Bally common stock for each $1,000 principal
amount of debentures tendered. Based on yesterday's closing
price of $10.625 for the common stock, analysts said
bondholders would receive equity worth almost $606 for each
$1,000 principal amount of debentures exchanged. That's
considerably more than what the bonds were trading at before
news of the exchange offer.
   The junk bonds of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. weakened after news that
other vendors and lenders are concerned about the retailer's
financial health.
   Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due in 1998
ended at a bid price of 68, off one point from Tuesday. The
14 1/2% subordinated debentures maturing in 2001 finished at
a bid of 58 1/2, down 1/2 point.
   Meanwhile, Michelin Finance B.V. said its offers to buy
Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.'s and UGTC Capital Corp.'s junk
bonds expired Tuesday without any bonds changing hands.
   Traders said investors are holding out, expecting Michelin
to sweeten the offer. But some investors are doubtful that a
higher offer will materialize, which explains why Uniroyal
Goodrich junk weakened slightly. The company's 14 1/8% senior
subordinated notes lost 1/4 point to end at 110 3/4.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade bonds with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings, ended about 1/4 point
higher.
   Investment-grade corporate bonds also closed about 1/4
point higher.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 101 18/32,
compared with 101 10/32 on Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes
ended at a price of 101 22/32 to yield 8.60%, compared with
101 15/32 to yield 8.63%.
   Short-term rates moved lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.75% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.99%, while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.67% to yield 8.07%.
   Here are details of yesterday's sale of cash-management
bills:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, which have risen considerably in
the past month, ended sharply higher again.
   Prices of long-term gilts climbed more than one point
during early trading, but they gave back some of the gains
later to end about 3/4 point higher.
   As in previous sessions, the impetus for the rally came
from the foreign exchange markets, where the pound resumed
its upward climb, especially against the mark.
   Once again, speculation about the imminent entry of the
pound into the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System was the starting point for the pound's rise.
Dealers said the latest speculation began ahead of a meeting
between Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major and his French
counterpart, Pierre Beregovoy. But no announcement on the
exchange rate mechanism was scheduled nor was such a meeting
expected by analysts.
   In Paris, Mr. Major helped damp the market's euphoria by
reiterating that monetary policy must remain tight for some
time to come and that higher interest rates can't be ruled
out.
   The Bank of England contributed to cooling things off with
its money market operations. Faced with an estimated shortage
in the money markets yesterday of #1.15 billion ($1.95
billion), the bank quickly arranged only #15 million of
repurchase agreements and then purchased through the rest of
the day a total of only #948 million of short-term bills to
help meet the shortage.
   "That was a clear signal to the market not to be looking
for lower interest rates soon," one dealer said.
   Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% security due in 2003/2007
ended 3/4 higher at 100 1/8 to yield 11.72%, while 12% notes
due in 1995 rose 9/32 to 98 29/32 to yield 12.29%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   After being stalled at their opening levels throughout the
morning, prices of mortgage-backed securities steadily edged
higher to stand at session highs late in the day.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
for June delivery were up 9/32 to 98 16/32. The spread
between the Ginnie Mae issue and the Treasury 10-year note
remained at 1.25 percentage points.
   News that sales of new single-family homes in April fell
1.6% had little impact on the mortgage-backed market.
   Ginnie Mae 9% securities were up 10/32 at 96 3/32, and 10%
securities were at 100 29/32, up 6/32.
   Meanwhile, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2%
securities were up 6/32 at 98 1/32, and 10% securities were
at 100 1/ 32, up 5/32. Federal National Mortgage Association
9 1/2% securities were up 6/32 at 98 17/32, and 10%
securities were at 100 18/32, up 5/32.

   New Construction
   Fell 6% in April
   To Four-Year Low

   NEW YORK -- New construction contracts fell 6% in April to
the lowest level in four years, reflecting a response to
regulatory clampdowns on high-risk real estate lending
practices.
   Nonresidential building contracts were down 12% from March
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $78.45 billion. The
value of newly started one-family homes and apartments
slipped 4% to $106.36 billion. Nonbuilding construction,
which includes public works and utilities, edged up 1% to
$45.38 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said
total U.S. construction contracts awarded in April fell to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $230.2 billion from
$245.47 billion in March. That brought the Dodge index down
to 146 from 156 the previous month. The index compares
current contracting with a 1982 base of 100.
   After a temporary rebound in March, the latest month's
setback continues a decline that began in late 1989.
Construction contract values to date this year are trailing
last year's total by 9%, on an unadjusted basis. Weakness was
evident in the four major regions, with sharpest drops in the
Northeast at 27%, followed by the South at 11%. The West was
even with last year's rates. The only improvement was in the
North Central region, which showed a 5% improvement,
according to Dodge.
   "The collapse of homebuilding in the first half of 1990,
despite workable mortgage rates, indicates a problem of
availability, rather than cost, of credit," said George A.
Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W. Dodge.

   TOKYO -- Trade statistics issued by the Japan Trade
Council, a group of major trading houses, show that Japan's
imports will continue to climb sharply because of strong
domestic demand.
   Import contracts signed in April by 18 leading trading
companies surged a record 65% from a year earlier to 1.359
trillion yen ($9 billion), the council said. This followed a
54% jump in import contracts concluded in the previous month.
The statistics indicate that imports will continue to
register sharp gains in the coming months, helping reduce
Japan's trade surplus.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trade gap has been dwindling steadily as the pace of
import growth has exceeded export gains, because of vigorous
domestic demand such as corporate investment in plant and
equipment that has been fueling sustained economic growth in
Japan. Export contracts signed in April totaled 849.7 billion
yen, a 20% increase from a year earlier.
   The council's report, based on contract data provided by
the trading companies, is considered to be a short-term
indicator of overall trade trends. The 18 trading houses
handle about half of Japan's overall exports and two-thirds
of imports.

   WARSAW -- Poland's state-run railroad, recently hit by a
crippling weeklong strike, will double passenger fares on
Friday, the official PAP news agency reported.
   The fare increases, which were planned before the labor
strike, result from higher fuel and other operating costs and
the cut in state subsidies under the new government's
economic overhaul program, a railway official told PAP.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The railroad had used government subsidies to keep fares
unrealistically low.
   For example, a first-class ticket for the three-hour
express train ride from Warsaw to Gdansk cost about three
dollars before the increases, and even less before the
inflation surge of the second half of 1989.
   Wildcat strikers snarled freight and passenger service to
northwest Poland from May 20 until Monday, when Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa persuaded the workers to return to their
jobs and give the government until June 13 to consider their
demands.
   The government, not veering from its anti-inflation
economic overhaul plan, had refused to consider pay raises
for the workers while the strike was on.
   However, officials said a plan, including new pay scales,
was being drafted to restructure the railroad for Poland's
post-Communist, market-driven economy.

   LONDON -- Britain's longer leading indicator of economic
activity fell in April from March, continuing a nearly
two-year slide, the Central Statistical Office said.
   The index, which indicates economic turning points about a
year in advance, dropped to 92.9 from 93.6. The index has
declined or stood even each month since May 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency said the index's fall so far in 1990 is partly
because of the influence of declining share prices.
   The coincident index, which generally moves in line with
current economic activity, also declined in April to 97.4
from 98.4 in March. This index has declined or gone unchanged
since August 1988.
   The shorter leading and the lagging indexes aren't
available for April.

   S.G. Warburg Group PLC, a British merchant banking and
stockbroking concern, said pretax profit for the year ended
March 31 rose 68% to #188 million ($318.4 million) from #112
million a year earlier, but warned it is unlikely to match
this performance in fiscal 1991.
   The pretax profit was below some market forecasts. Fiscal
first-half pretax profit more than doubled to #102.6 million,
largely from corporate finance activity; its pace slowed in
the second half.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Profit after taxes and minority interests jumped 67% to
#112 million from #66.9 million, and fully diluted per-share
earnings rose 64% to 49.9 pence from 30.4 pence. Net profit
attributable to shareholders, after preference-share dividend
payments, increased 73% to #108 million from #62.5 million.
Warburg said it will recommend a final dividend of 10.5 pence
a share, raising the total payout for the year to 15 pence
from 12.5 pence.
   In its cautious fiscal 1991 forecast, Warburg cited tight
monetary policies and high real interest rates as reducing
corporate takeover activity, and low securities trading
volume.

   NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has agreed to buy the main
businesses of Elders Futures Inc., a futures and options arm
of Australian brewer Elders IXL that has been on the block
for several months, people close to the transaction said.
   The move is part of a series of asset sales by merchant
bank Elders Finance Group Ltd., an Elders IXL unit that owns
Elders Futures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Merrill is making the acquisition to beef up its Merrill
Lynch Futures metals and energy futures operations. Merrill
will pay less than $20 million for Elders Futures, people
close to the transaction said.
   A Merrill spokesman declined to comment. However, an
announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire the main
businesses of Elders Futures is expected as soon as today.
   The one part of Elders Futures that Merrill won't buy is
the financial-futures operations. Securities-industry
executives said those operations would be sold to
Chicago-based Cargill Investor Services Inc., a subsidiary of
Cargill Inc., Minneapolis. A Cargill spokesman confirmed the
purchase yesterday, but declined to disclose the terms.
   Gene D. Donney, president of Elders Futures, didn't return
phone calls.
   The Elders IXL parent company operates agribusiness,
trading, brewing and finance companies in nearly 30
countries, and is perhaps known best for its Fosters Lager.
Elders Futures provides brokerage, research and other
services in New York, Chicago, London and Geneva, with a
staff of about 175.

   Designated Chief
   At Westinghouse
   Has High Goals

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   PITTSBURGH -- Paul E. Lego, Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s
newly designated chief executive officer, is setting
ambitious goals.
   The 60-year-old president, who succeeds Chairman John C.
Marous Jr. in the No. 1 job effective July 1, said he expects
the company's profit and revenue to double "long before the
end of the decade." Last year, the company earned $922
million, or $6.31 a share, on revenue of $12.8 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Westinghouse closed at $35, down 62.5 cents.
   "We will be a great company. We are very close to being
that right now," Mr. Lego said in his first interview since
being named to the job. He expects the company to continue to
have a return on equity in the 18% to 21% range. Corporate
revenues, meanwhile, should continue to grow at least 8.5%
annually.
   Some of that growth will clearly come from acquisitions.
The executive noted, though, that while he doesn't rule out
blockbuster acquisitions entirely, he would prefer smaller
ones, in the $250 million to $500 million range. Mr. Lego
also said Westinghouse won't make acquisitions outside its
present portfolio of financial-service, broadcasting and
diversified-manufacturing businesses.
   Specifically, the executive said he wants to supplement
Westinghouse's existing businesses in air-traffic control
equipment as well as the production of news and entertainment
programming that can be aired both in the U.S. and overseas.
   He said he'd be "tickled to death" to acquire a company
involved in international air-traffic control, which would
enhance Westinghouse's Electronic Systems Group. That unit
has been trying to expand its presence in the commercial
sector in the face of likely cutbacks in military spending.
   Citing legal constraints, Mr. Lego declined to comment on
rumors that Westinghouse might be interested in making a bid
for Sundstrand Corp., an aerospace parts maker based in
Rockford, Ill. However, he cast doubt on the likelihood of a
bid, mainly because Sundstrand probably would cost more than
$2 billion, and therefore would dilute earnings.
   He acknowledged that Westinghouse's growth path "scares"
some people who follow the company because they fear it will
make poor acquisitions. But he said Westinghouse is picky and
has already screened "thousands of companies" as possible
acquisition candidates. "We're very controlled," he said,
reflecting his own analytical temperament. Confident and
intense, Mr. Lego, is the son of a steelworker and joined
Westinghouse in 1956 as an electrical engineer.
   Increasing the company's revenue, however, "is an
imperative," he said. In recent years the company has
divested underperforming assets that produced about $1
billion of revenue and Westinghouse now wants to replace that
revenue, he said.
   As for future succession at Westinghouse, Mr. Lego clearly
wants to establish a horse race for the No. 2 job. The
executive said he would continue to carry the president's
title for several years. The several possible presidential
candidates, he said, need additional "seasoning" before they
are ready to succeed him.

   TOKYO -- Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses fell
18% to 430,216 units in April from a year earlier, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association said.
   The year-to-year decline was the sharpest since December
1986, when vehicle exports fell 17.8% year-to-year, according
to the association.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A sharp drop in exports to the U.S., the largest importer
of Japanese vehicles, and a decline in exports by Toyota
Motor Corp., the nation's top car exporter, contributed to
the fall in the overall exports, an official at the
association said.
   The slowdown of exports to the U.S. should be seen as a
trend due to declining demand and continuing expansion of
production in the U.S. by Japanese car makers, the official
said.

   WAYNE, N.J. -- Lederle Laboratories was cleared to begin
marketing an antihypertensive drug that will be the first
direct competitor in the U.S. against the best-selling drugs
of G.D. Searle &amp; Co. and Knoll Pharmaceuticals.
   The Food and Drug Administration's approval of the drug,
sold under the trade name Verelan, gives Lederle its first
entry in the big U.S. market for drugs called calcium channel
blockers that are made in once-a-day doses. Lederle had
licensed U.S. marketing rights to Verelan from Elan Corp.
after Elan applied for FDA approval.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lederle, a division of American Cyanamid Co., will market
Verelan directly against Searle's Calan SR and Knoll's
Isoptin SR. All three drugs are formulated from the same
compound, known generically as verapamil.
   But Elan, of Althone, Ireland, developed Verelan with its
own sustained-release technology and put the drug through its
own clinical trials. As a result, Verelan isn't classified as
a generic drug and probably won't start an intense price war.
A Lederle spokesman said that the pricing will be
"competitive" with that of the Searle and Knoll drugs.
   In the U.S. in 1989, sales of Calan SR, which Searle
licenses from Knoll, were $364 million; U.S. sales of Isoptin
SR were about $90 million. Searle is a subsidiary of Monsanto
Co., St. Louis. Knoll is a subsidiary of BASF AG,
Ludwigshafen, West Germany.
   Elan estimated annual U.S. sales of calcium channel
blockers at $1.5 billion. Several drugs of this class,
besides verapamil compounds, also are on the market. Their
uses include treating chest pains known as angina pectoris,
as well as treating high blood pressure.

   Burma's Avalanche

   From the abyss of Burma comes the Marxist world's latest
cry for freedom. After 28 years of vicious one-party rule by
Ne Win and his military proteges, the Burmese government on
Sunday attempted to legitimize itself with a managed
election. It miscalculated. Voters delivered a landslide
victory to the opposition National League for Democracy.
   Sadly, it's a long shot that Burma's vote will translate
smoothly into democratic government. The ruling military
junta has said that the newly elected legislature must write
a new constitution before there is any serious transfer of
power. It is perfectly capable of using that requirement as
an excuse for an indefinite stall that ignores the popular
will while it renews its policy of political oppression.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since democratic protests broke out in 1988, the junta has
employed shootings, jailings and forced resettlements to
discourage its critics. The winning opposition's most
prominent figure, Aung San Suu Kyi, is serving a one-year
sentence under house arrest. Another opposition leader, U Tin
Oo, is doing three years of hard labor for sedition. Hundreds
more remain in prison.
   But whatever comes next, Burma's vote offers encouragement
that democracy may yet prevail over the tyrannies of Asia --
where no communist regime has fallen so far.
   Conventional wisdom likes to blame the despotic gridlock
on Asian cultures, which are presumed to have some affinity
for dictatorships. Burma reminds us that since communism
proved itself a ferocious failure in the region, Asian
cultures have shown a keen affinity for Voice of America
broadcasts, fax machines, and anything that brings news of
how good life can be in a free society.
   Burma's people know enough to place no trust in their
government, whose Burmese Way to Socialism has reduced their
once rich country to a poor and forgotten hellhole. Tuned in
to the VOA, the BBC and Indian radio, they have heard about
the Tiananmen uprising in China and the overthrow of
communism in Eastern Europe. According to diplomats based in
Bangkok and Rangoon, the Burmese took special note of the
fall of Romania's tyrant, Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Indeed, Burmese dissidents like to point out, correctly,
that the democratic avalanche of the past year really began
almost two years ago in Burma. It was in the summer of 1988
that Burmese protesters took to the streets, demanding
democratic reform. They were killed by the thousands. But not
before they had achieved the formal resignation of Ne Win,
who after 26 years of misrule was at least banished to
behind-the-scenes manipulation of today's military junta. And
not before they had reminded the world that even in such
obscure places as Burma, there were people brave enough to
challenge what seemed then an immovable Marxist regime.
   It would be a pity for Burma's glad news to be swept under
the clippings of this week's Bush-Gorbachev summit. Burma's
next move bears watching, not only because its people have
shown admirable courage and a great appetite for freedom, but
also because their persistence will not be lost on the people
of countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and especially
China. What began with Burma's 1988 days of rage may yet feed
into a democratic avalanche in Asia to match the one in
Europe.

   This is in regard to Jose de Cordoba's April 19 article
recalling his trip to Cuba.
   It may be true that you do not see children begging in
Havana or "misery belts" surrounding the city. Other things
that you do not see in Havana are freedom and prosperity. You
do not see the small business. Or the corner newsstand where
people drink a cup of coffee and enjoy a political
discussion. Or the middle-class neighborhoods where families
live and enjoy watching their uncensored TV programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By Mr. de Cordoba's standard, most cities in the world
wouldn't compare favorably with Havana. Yet we do not see
Haitians rowing their rafts to Cuba. But we do see Cubans
rowing to Miami.
   One thing you do see in Havana, and not in other Latin
American capitals, are hotels and restaurants for the
exclusive use of tourists. There is no other country that
excludes its citizens, and its currency, from tourists'
resorts. Newlyweds cannot spend their honeymoon in the better
Cuban resorts. A Cuban cannot take his family out to dinner
at one of these exclusive restaurants. This is the way life
is in the "socialist paradise" of Cuba.
   Something puzzles me. Journalists who visit Cuba always
speak of the free health care enjoyed by Cubans. On the other
hand, our relatives in Cuba are always requesting medicine in
their letters. The answer is that Fidel Castro has been
better at building hospitals than providing medicine.
Furthermore, he has done all of this by turning Cuba into one
of the world's indebted nations. His legacy will be political
prisons and a massive foreign debt.
   When Mr. Castro moves from the political scene, and Cuba's
doors are finally opened to the world, we will learn the
truth of Cuba. As with Romania and the other East European
countries, we will learn about the corruption, the faulty
health care, the ecology crisis and the people's discontent.
   Communism has been far better at impressing U.S.
journalists and academicians than at gaining the acceptance
of local citizens. We saw this in Eastern Europe. And we will
soon see what Cubans have known for 30 years: The venerated
Mr. Castro and his socialist paradise have been a big fraud.

   Cleaner Incinerators Drawing Less Fire

   The first garbage-burning plant in Hempstead, N.Y., was a
disaster. It rarely worked, and when it did, it smelled like
rotten eggs. Its chimney spewed soot, heavy metals and
dioxin. Neighborhood groups, fearing for children's safety,
picketed the plant. After it closed in 1980, they protested
to stop it from reopening.
   But Hempstead's garbage crisis only got worse. The Long
Island community's 740,000 residents continued to generate
mountains of trash. The first of its two local landfills
closed in 1984, the second in 1988. Then the
"not-in-my-backyard" activists became realists. If an
incinerator plant was inevitable, they would fight for the
cleanest one they could get.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Their campaign seems to have succeeded. Since last year,
Hempstead has had a new, high-tech incinerator that is
considered among the cleanest and safest anywhere. State
regulators, who issued a final operating permit this month,
conclude that it poses no health threat. And town officials
say the plant will save $49 million a year, consuming all of
the community's trash at half the cost of hauling it to
distant landfills.
   The Hempstead project could become a model for a national
incinerator program. Experts say it demonstrates how an
improved plant design and responsiveness to community
concerns could help resolve the national deadlock over trash
disposal. "These technologies have demonstrated they protect
the public health and are much more benign than landfills,"
says William Rosenberg, Environmental Protection Agency
assistant administrator.
   The $360 million waste-to-energy facility is operated by
American Ref-Fuel, a joint venture of Air Products &amp;
Chemicals Inc. and Browning-Ferris Industries. American
Ref-Fuel is among six major participants in an industry that
is growing rapidly as landfill capacity diminishes.
   The potential for burning trash is tremendous. By 1994,
the EPA estimates that incinerator plants will consume 15% to
20% of the nation's municipal waste. To help meet that need,
52 plants are under construction or approved to join the list
of 166 already operating. Capacity could double to more than
200,000 tons a day by the year 2000, says analyst Richard J.
Sweetnam Jr. of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   But growth isn't guaranteed. Some incinerator projects are
being delayed or canceled as more cities view recycling as a
safer and cheaper alternative to burning waste. Among the
concerns is incinerator ash, which represents about 10% of
the volume of waste. Ash is laden with toxic heavy metals and
dioxin and must be deposited in special landfills.
   Seattle, for example, decided to increase its recycling
rate to 60% by 1998, from 36% currently, after the city found
such an approach would be cheaper than dumping most waste in
landfills or building an incinerator. "The public was very
concerned that an incinerator would be a disincentive for
recycling," says Lorie Parker of the Seattle Solid Waste
Utility.
   Similarly, Los Angeles and Philadelphia canceled
incinerators because of public opposition, while New Jersey,
Massachusetts and New York City have delayed new projects in
hopes of promoting recycling. Isolated pollution problems
continue to fan public fears. Detroit's new incinerator was
shut down temporarily in April for exceeding mercury emission
limits. The facility agreed to screen garbage to remove
mercury-laden "button" batteries and install better pollution
controls.
   American Ref-Fuel's plant in Hempstead is among a new
generation of incinerators that is improving the outlook for
an industry damaged by plant failures in the late 1970s. The
plant relies on "mass burn" technology, widely used in Europe
and Japan for 25 years, which is cleaner burning and more
dependable than early refuse-derived fuel plants.
   Waste is fed into the furnace on rolling drums known as
grates. Computers monitoring temperature and pollutants
automatically adjust the speed of the grates and the air
mixture to maximize combustion. Next, a "scrubber" injects
lime into the flue gas to neutralize acid rain components.
Finally, a "baghouse" containing more than 1,000 vacuum
cleaner-like bags captures ash particles. The ash is trucked
to a landfill near Buffalo at $140 a ton. Federal officials
say such pollution controls should meet strict national
standards, proposed for adoption later this year, that would
require 85% to 99% reductions of key pollutants. They expect
these tough safety standards to diminish opposition to
incinerators.
   Tests show the Hempstead technology works. Plant emissions
were far below state standards for 16 chemical pollutants
sampled over three weeks. Dioxin, a suspected carcinogen, and
particulates, which include most toxic metals, were at least
five times lower than proposed federal standards. "These
results are the lowest I've seen in New York state. We are
very impressed," says Harold D. Berger, regional director of
the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The state
Health Department concluded that the cancer risk was less
than one in one million, which it says is about the risk of
being hit by a train. The plant would require minor
modifications to comply with proposed limits for gases
causing acid rain.
   But some environmentalists complain that annual testing
for dioxin and particulates isn't frequent enough. Theodore
D. Goldfarb, a chemistry professor at State University of New
York at Stony Brook and member of the town's solid waste
advisory committee, worries that recent results may reflect
ideal conditions. "You need a lot more test results over a
longer period of time to get an accurate picture of the
plant's emissions," Mr. Goldfarb says.
   Town officials say the plant has exceeded their
expectations. Since it began commercial operation in October,
the plant has been running at its 2,250 tons-per-day capacity
97% of the time. The town's waste disposal fees have dropped
to $79 a ton, from $160 a ton.
   Burning garbage is also a good deal for its owners. Air
Products estimates the plant will earn $3 million to $6
million this year, with profits rising steadily to $12
million to $15 million by 1995. Like other new plants,
roughly half of its revenue comes from its steam turbine,
which generates enough electric power for 60,000 homes.
   The Hempstead project also has been helped by a
sophisticated community relations program to calm fears and
counter negative perceptions of the previous plant. In 1986,
when the state was going to allow American Ref-Fuel to build
a new incinerator, neighborhood groups mobilized. They
demanded American Ref-Fuel install the "baghouse" filter and
build its stack 384 feet high instead of only 284.
   At various stages, the plant sent four newsletters to each
of the town's 250,000 households. Plant officials meet
monthly with local activists and make available plant
emissions records. A 24-hour hot line was installed after
neighbors complained they couldn't reach anyone to inquire
about a dark plume that appeared one Sunday. State officials
say the plume was caused by a baghouse malfunction that has
since been corrected.
   Activist Shelley Lotenberg, who lives a half-mile away,
says the plant is now "as safe as we can make it." But there
is continuing concern about potential hazards in the waste
stream. For example, neighborhood groups forced the plant to
reject hospital waste and are pushing the town to recycle
plastic and compost yard waste. Mrs. Lotenberg complains that
recycling efforts are limited in Hempstead now because
three-fourths of the town's waste is contracted to the plant.
Proposed federal regulations would require the town to
recycle 25% of waste, up from 13% today, and collect
batteries to further reduce toxic metal emissions.
   American Ref-Fuel officials say the plant, their first in
operation, is their best selling tool. The firm is building
incinerators in Newark, N.J., and Preston, Conn., and has
been selected to build plants in Bergen County, N.J., and

   SEOUL -- The South Korean government will limit the supply
of new stocks to 300 billion won ($427.4 million) a month in
a bid to revive the stock market, the Ministry of Finance
said.
   Ministry officials said the government will limit the
issuing of shares by listed companies to 250 billion won a
month and by previously unlisted companies to 50 billion won.
The limits will remain in effect until the stock market
recovers from its current bearishness, they said. The
market's key index has fallen about 14% this year, despite
government measures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Financial institutions, which have provided a large amount
of new stocks to the market recently, will be banned from
issuing new shares until market sentiment improves, under the
ruling. Small and midsized companies, which face more
difficulties in raising capital than large corporations, will
be given priority in getting government approval for issuing
new shares.
   Under the ruling, stocks issued this year could total only
about 3.4 trillion won, including 1.3 trillion won to date,
compared with 14.1 trillion won in 1989.

   Xerox Seeks to Sell
   Part of Financing,
   Leasing Operation

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Xerox Corp. said it put up for sale
much of its third-party financing and leasing operation,
further backing away from its financial-services business and
counterbalancing a large write-off that is said to be in the
offing.
   The businesses on the block represent about $2.2 billion,
or about 40%, of the financial assets of Xerox Credit Corp.,
Xerox's financing subsidiary. They also include $140 million
in assets in international third-party financing but don't
affect the financing of Xerox equipment or any other Xerox
finance-oriented businesses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Alex Henderson, analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., valued the businesses for sale at between $150 million
and $300 million. Xerox couldn't be reached for comment on
its target price.
   Yesterday's announcement comes amid Xerox's recent
disillusionment with its financial-services business, which
was responsible for a $375 million first-quarter write-off
related to bad real-estate investments.
   Wall Street analysts have tied that change in corporate
attitude to the appointment of Paul Allaire, head of the
company's business-equipment arm, as successor to David
Kearns as chief executive.
   Mr. Allaire is known as a cost-cutter, and analysts say he
has sent out word that unprofitable businesses, especially in
the financial-services sector, must shape up or be sold.
   But yesterday's announcement also coincided with
speculation about another impending write-off, related to
Xerox's Crum &amp; Forster insurance unit. That speculation,
featured in an article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal,
sent Xerox shares diving $1.75 a share to close at $46.50 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   "The timing obviously isn't an accident," said Mr.
Henderson. "The specter of some fairly significant write-offs
scared a lot of people, but this should compensate and put
the stock back on track."
   The announcement was made after the market closed
yesterday. Mr. Henderson said he expects Xerox shares to
rebound to previous levels on the news today. "The Street
will laud any move to sell anything in financial services,"
he said. "Anything that takes debt and liability off the
balance sheet will be viewed positively."

   SEATTLE -- The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will
conduct "interference proceedings" to determine which of two
sparring biotechnology companies have rightful claim to a
patent to GM-CSF, a promising protein hormone that increases
infection-fighting white blood cells.
   Immunex Corp., based here, interpreted the government's
decision to hold an administrative hearing as a sign that the
company is still "a serious contender" in the patent race.
Genetics Institute Inc., the Cambridge, Mass.-based company
that filed its patent application for GM-CSF in July 1984,
maintains that Immunex forfeited its claim by filing its
application three months later.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for Genetics Institute said, "We filed our
application first, we published our results first, and we
feel we are in the stronger position." She characterized the
hearings as "standard procedure" when two parties file
applications less than six months apart. (Genetics Institute
has assigned its patent application to Sandoz Pharmaceuticals
Corp., an East Hanover, N.J. drug company.)
   U.S. law, however, states that the party who first invents
the product, not the one who first files an application,
should receive the patent. Scott Hallquist, Immunex's general
counsel, said that his company has lab records and witnesses
who will show that the firm invented the hormone "early
enough for us to win." The government is expected to make a
decision within two years.
   GM-CSF is a protein that appears to shorten recovery time
for bone-marrow transplant patients and reduce bone-marrow
failures among some AIDS patients. The patent war over the
drug has high financial stakes. Analysts have estimated the
potential U.S. market for GM-CSF could run about $300 million
to $600 million a year. And if Immunex received the patent,
it could likely turn a profit for the first time by 1991,
according to its chief financial officer, Alen Frazier.
   Immunex is also currently ensnared in interference
proceedings over interleukin2, an immune-systems booster.
Immunex is claiming patent rights along with Japan's
Dainippon and Switzerland's F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co.

   Index of Leading

   0.2% in April

   Despite the Second Decline
   In 4 Months, Economists
   Don't Foresee Recession

   WASHINGTON -- The government's premier gauge of expected
economic strength declined slightly in April, indicating
continuing weakness.
   The Commerce Department's index of leading economic
indicators dropped 0.2% in April, diluting the optimistic
outlook suggested by the 1.0% increase in March. It was the
index's second decline in four months. The leading
indicators, intended to foreshadow economic activity several
months in advance, tumbled 1.0% in February after holding
steady in January.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the figures do suggest a weakness in the economy,
economic analysts said, they don't foreshadow a recession.
   "This trendless indicator suggests that the economy is
going to grow slowly," said David Berson, chief financial
economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association.
   Bob Dieli, a financial economist at Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, also forecast slow growth, saying the indicators'
seesaw behavior reflects "a mixed economy that is still
managing to move forward."
   In another sign of sluggishness in the economy, the
Commerce Department also reported that new home sales dropped
1.6% in April, the fifth straight month of decline.
   Seven of the 11 statistics making up the index of leading
indicators contributed to the April decline: average
workweek, unemployment claims, factory orders, capital
spending, building permits, unfilled orders and stock prices.
Positive contributions were made by vendor deliveries, raw
materials prices, money supply, and consumer expectations.
   Many economists said the April drop doesn't mean the
economy is deteriorating.
   "Nothing has changed," said Fred Sturn, senior financial
economist with Fuji Securities Inc. The numbers "have been
bobbing up and down for the last year . . . we're looking at
low growth."
   April's 1.4% decline in new home sales, following a 8.4%
drop in March, brought this key sector of the housing
industry to its lowest level since December 1982, when the
country had just emerged from a recession. Sales of new
single-family homes fell to an annual rate of 546,000 in
April, the department said, from a 555,000 annual rate in
March.
   Economists said increased mortgage rates were a major
contributor to the April drop, but predicted a slow decline
in the rates for the rest of the year.
   In fact, mortgage rates have already begun to come down a
bit in May, and Mr. Berson of Fannie Mae said he expects home
sales to pick up during the next two months.
   Sharing Mr. Berson's view, Mr. Sturn said, "A bottom may
be forming in the home sales market."
   Mr. Sturn said that although lower mortgage rates should
help the market to level off, "the issue of whether banks
will be willing to make loans" is still an important factor
in the level of housing sales. "Interest rates are secondary
to credit policy," said Mr. Sturn.
   The numbers in both reports were adjusted for normal
seasonal fluctuations.

   Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments, they produced a 0.2% decline in the
index for April and a 1.0% increase for March.

   Beware of Accountants Promising Riches

   It adds a whole new terror to taxes: Many financial scams
now involve accountants and tax preparers who select their
victims from among those whose returns they handle.
   In one such case, a jury in Dayton, Ohio, recently found
Naomi Taubman guilty of 60 counts of securities-law
violations in connection with the sale of "promissory notes"
to her tax clients. Victims testified that the 64-year-old
accountant told them they would receive returns as high as
24%, tax-free, says Richard Lipowicz, a prosecutor with the
fraud and economic-crimes division of the Montgomery County
prosecutor's office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cases like this alarm securities regulators, who foresee
an increase in the number of complaints of fraud and abuse
involving accountants. The reason, they say, is that more and
more accountants are giving investment advice without, in
most cases, having to register as investment advisers.
   "They've got the books and records to know how much money
is there for the taking, and they have your trust," says
Scott Stapf of the North American Securities Administrators
Association. "That's a big leg up on ripping someone off."
   In the Taubman case, most of the victims were the
accountant's tax clients, says Mr. Lipowicz, assistant
prosecuting attorney. "She had prepared their tax returns --
in some cases for 40 years," he says. So when it came to
accepting investment advice, "they trusted her judgment
implicitly."
   Ms. Taubman's attorney, John H. Rion, says that his client
"merely borrowed money from clients and signed promissory
notes to secure those loans. We fully expect the case to be
reversed on appeal."
   Accounting-industry officials say that abuses by certified
public accountants aren't widespread. The cases that get
publicity typically involve financial advisers who take
custody of their clients' funds and sell investment products,
says John Hudson, director of accounting and consulting
services at the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. "These are not areas that most CPAs get involved
in," he says.
   Many cases of fraud involving accountants are Ponzi
schemes in which money from new investors is used to make
"interest" payments to those who invested earlier. Victims
are also often lulled by words such as "guaranteed,"
"insured," and "tax-free." As a result, they may not become
suspicious for months or years -- or until they try to get
their principal back.
   Typically, victims of these schemes are given bogus
debentures and promised returns in the 12% to 15% range.
   To get the money to "invest," they are frequently
encouraged to withdraw funds from individual retirement
accounts and other tax-deferred retirement plans, even though
this subjects their money to a 10% early withdrawal penalty
and taxes. In a recent case in Missouri, officials at the
state securities division allege, accountant Paul B. Brock
told clients his firm would pay the penalties for them. Mr.
Brock is currently awaiting trial on criminal charges in a
state court in Neosho, Mo. The public defender assigned to
the case had no comment.
   Investors are more vulnerable to fraud perpetrated by
their accountant because they know the person, securities
regulators say. They also say people are less suspicious of
investment advice proffered by an accountant -- particularly
when it includes tax strategies -- than they would be if it
came from a stockbroker or some other financial professional
who they figured was getting commissions for selling the
products being recommended.
   Consider the case of John Wyatt Duncan Jr., a 29-year-old
accountant sentenced to five to 15 years in prison in Kansas
after pleading guilty to several charges. According to the
arrest warrant issued for Mr. Duncan, one of his victims was
a widow with nine children whose tax returns he prepared.
   The warrant alleged that Mr. Duncan told her to withdraw
$203,238 from retirement accounts and mutual funds and put
all her money into something called "International
Investments." He told her the investment was fully insured
and would pay 12%, guaranteed for five years, the warrant
alleged. In fact, it said, the company didn't exist, and the
woman lost all her money.
   Other alleged victims included a couple who were told that
their IRAs needed to be rolled over into some other
tax-deferred program, a wheelchair-bound widow with a
maturing certificate of deposit, and a 17 year-old who had
received his father's death benefit. "This took away his
chance of a college education, and one retiree is now mowing
lawns to make ends meet," says Kansas Securities Commissioner
M. Douglas Mays.
   An attorney retained by Mr. Duncan had no comment.
   Accounting regulations vary from state to state, but only
a few states require accountants to register as investment
advisers -- and then only in some cases. Accountants are also
exempt from federal registration requirements for investment
advisers, as long as giving investment advice is incidental
to their practice.
   Various measures have been proposed to subject accountants
who give investment advice to greater regulation. A bill
introduced in Congress in March by Rep. Rick Boucher (D.,
Va.) would require accountants and others who receive
compensation as financial planners to register as investment
advisers.
   Accounting-industry officials say, however, that having
accountants register as investment advisers wouldn't curb
fraudulent or abusive behavior, but would leave accountants
open to more lawsuits. Consumers would be the ones to suffer
in the end, they say.
   "Qualified, competent, objective practitioners would be
deterred from giving financial planning advice because of the
specter of potential litigation," says William Goldberg,
chairman of personal financial planning legislation and
regulation subcommittee of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants.
   Whatever the case, an investor's best hope of avoiding
fraud, says securities regulators, is to "exercise the same
judgment you'd use with any investment adviser, such as a
financial planner or stockbroker," says Mr. Mays, the Kansas
regulator. "If you're suspicious, check with the securities
regulator in your state, or the state board of accountancy,
which will tell you whether they're certified and whether
they've had any complaints."

             Red Flags for Accounting Clients
                                                                                                       

   Spotting a crooked accountant or tax preparer can be
tough, but some things should make you suspicious. Think
about taking your business elsewhere if your accountant:
                                                                                                       

 -- Tells you to withdraw money from IRAs, 401(k)s, pension
plans and other tax-advantaged retirement accounts and put
all of it in another investment.
                                                                                                       

 -- Dangles an offer to get you into an investment with
above-market returns (say, 12% in the current environment),
especially if the investment is "tax-free."
                                                                                                       

 -- Urges you to put all of your money in a single
investment, particularly one that's supposedly "insured,"
"guaranteed" or "tax-free."

opportunity.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Caseloads of State Courts Soared in 1988

   State courts, the workhorses of the nation's court system,
added an astonishing total of 98 million new cases to their
dockets in 1988, the most recent year for which data are
available.
   While 68 million involved traffic and ordinance
violations, more than 30 million were new civil, criminal and
juvenile cases, according to a study by the National Center
for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In contrast, about 962,000 cases were brought into federal
courts last year, nearly 5% more than in 1988.
   State court civil filings in 1988 increased 4.3% from
1987, and new criminal cases rose more than 5%. The overall
increase in new filings is consistent with the steady growth
in state court caseloads since the center began the annual
study in 1984, says David Rottman, project director.
   Completion of cases filed in state courts in previous
years has not kept pace with new filings, the study shows.
The center estimates that the number of cases added to state
court dockets in 1988 exceeds the number of files closed by
about 5%.
   In the state trial courts that hear the most serious
felony and misdemeanor cases, filings of criminal cases rose
an unprecedented 8.4%, a rate which, if it continues, could
double the number of these cases every decade. Court experts
say the upsurge in state-level criminal cases is largely an
indication of a rise in drug-related prosecutions, which are
also clogging the federal courts.
   Defense lawyers, who have long complained about a
so-called litigation explosion, view the data as confirmation
that litigation is out of hand. Defense attorney James Morris
of the Richmond, Va., law firm Morris &amp; Morris says one
reason for court congestion is judges' willingness to admit
unreliable expert testimony. Many cases, he said, wouldn't
"even be filed if it weren't for the fact that some paid
expert loosely applying science is able to give an opinion"
that the plaintiff should recover.
   But the president of the mostly plaintiff-oriented
American Trial Lawyers Association played down the caseload
increase, saying it has generally kept pace with population
growth and has also reflected the rise in business failures.
The group's president, Russ Herman, said: "Even if all types
of litigation were increasing, in a democracy that's good.
The civil courts are the pressure valve for society."
   George Milko of HALT, a Washington organization that seeks
to promote the interests of consumers of legal services,
notes that the persistent rise in case filings provides
evidence that efforts to promote forms of dispute resolution
outside the court are not succeeding. "Maybe we ask our
courts to do more than they can handle," he says.

   RETIREE BENEFIT termination is halted by court restraining
order.
   A federal judge in Connecticut ordered the energy
conglomerate Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine of Paris to
refrain temporarily from terminating a health benefits plan
for former senior executives of Texasgulf Inc., a U.S. oil
company acquired by the French company in 1981.
   Richard D. Mollison, who was chairman and chief executive
officer of Raleigh, N.C., company at the time of the
acquisition, sued Elf Aquitaine and its current chief
executive officer, Michel Schneider-Maunoury, after he
received a letter from Mr. Schneider-Maunoury that said the
plan would be abolished May 31, 1990.
   Marilyn Ford, a professor of law at the University of
Bridgeport in Connecticut, who represented Mr. Mollison,
asked the judge for a restraining order, arguing that the
takeover agreement guarantees continuation of the benefit
plan.
   The suit is part of a recent trend of cases against
companies that attempt to cut retirees' benefits in response
to rising health care costs. The case appears to be one of
the first in which a judge has put a restraining order on a
company before any termination of benefits.
   A spokesman for Elf Aquitaine said that the company
decided "to provide the same medical coverage for senior
officers as everybody else." He said although the takeover
agreement stipulates that employee benefit levels would not
be changed, the rising cost of health care has created a
definitional dispute over whether "level of benefits" implies
costs borne by the company or health services actually
received by retirees.
   Elf Aquitaine has retained the New York law firm Sullivan
&amp; Cromwell to represent it in the lawsuit. The judge
scheduled a hearing for June 1, when he will consider
granting a preliminary injunction, a stronger measure than
the restraining order he issued last week.
   Ms. Ford said that other former Texasgulf executives have
expressed interest in joining Mr. Mollison as plaintiffs in
the lawsuit and that there is potential for a class action
against the company.

   NEW YORK ELECTION law is challenged as unconstitutional in
federal suit.
   The lawsuit, filed by a group of labor unions, targets the
state's requirement that voters must register at least 60
days in advance to be able to vote in a primary election.
Deborah H. Karpatkin, an attorney for the unions and for 100%
Vote/Human Serve Campaign, a national group seeking to make
registration easier, said New York's 60-day cutoff "is one of
the longest, if not the longest," in the U.S.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, claims the
requirement is unreasonable and detrimental to voter turnout.
"It places a harsh and unnecessary barrier in the way of
citizens' ability to participate in the political process. .
. . Many primary contests don't reach a high level of public
attention until the last few weeks before the election, when
it is too late to register for that primary," the suit said.
For the general election, the registration cutoff is 30 days
before the vote.
   A spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections said
the board and the state attorney general's office are
reviewing the suit. He said 60-day requirement is meant
mainly to deter "party raiding," in which a member of one
party tries to influence the opposing party's primary
results.
   For instance, a voter might register in the other party's
primary in an effort to get the other party's weaker
candidate into the general election, the spokesman said.

   CHINESE PROVINCE appoints U.S. lawyer as legal
representative.
   John T. Kesler, president of the 18-lawyer Salt Lake City
law firm of Woodbury, Jensen, Kesler &amp; Swinton, said he will
represent Szechwan province in business dealings and in legal
disputes between U.S. and Szechwan organizations. Szechwan
province has more than 105 million residents and is in
Western China. Many defense and aerospace companies are based
there.
   Woodbury Jensen specializes in international commercial
work, as well as real estate, technology and corporate law. A
visiting Chinese lawyer is an associate with the firm. The
firm has also established ties with four Chinese law firms in
different parts of China.
   Mr. Kesler received the appointment after lecturing in the
province's capital on international commercial law.

   SALARY FREEZE: Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, one of the
nation's largest law firms, said it will keep starting
salaries this year at 1989 levels, ending years of annual
increases. In all its cities except New York, the
1,160-attorney firm will pay new lawyers, who arrive during
the summer and fall, a salary package worth $74,000. In New
York, the figure is $83,000. Michael H. Carpenter, the Jones
Day partner in charge of recruiting, said the Cleveland law
firm decided that "this was an appropriate year to hold the
line in terms of the concerns of our clients and in terms of
outside legal costs and in controlling those outside legal
costs." Jones Day's move could tempt other firms, many of
them hit hard by the current slowdown in corporate deal work,
to hold the line on salaries as well.

   ROSENMAN &amp; COLIN, New York, will merge its six-attorney

Casson &amp; Harkins's Joseph Casson, who said his own firm would
benefit from Rosenman's expertise in taxes and securities.

   Who's News:
   Borden's D'Amato
   Named President,
   Operating Chief

FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Borden Inc., continuing a tradition of tapping
its chemical operations for top management, named Anthony S.
D'Amato president and chief operating officer, effective July
1.
   The appointment of Mr. D'Amato, 59 years old, comes at a
time when Borden, largely a food business, is going through a
restructuring designed to streamline its food and
consumer-products operations by consolidating production
plants and cutting back its dairy business. The two posts
have been vacant since early 1987, when R.J. Ventres became
Borden's chairman. Mr. Ventres, 65, remains chairman and
chief executive officer. It is clear, however, that the
choice of Mr. D'Amato puts him firmly in line to take over
from Mr. Ventres at his expected retirement at the end of
1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. D'Amato's background as a corporate executive vice
president and president of the packaging and industrial
products division, which accounted for 23% of the company's
$7.59 billion sales in 1989, gave food industry analysts
little expectation that the company eventually would shed its
films and adhesives business to concentrate solely on its
food lines. A number of large food companies have been
disposing of non-food operations in recent years.
   Mr. D'Amato said he planned to continue the strategies
that were put in place within the past year, including
efforts to reduce costs through restructuring and investing
significant capital in building more-efficient plants.
Borden, the nation's leading milk producer, took a charge of
$404.4 million in the third quarter for its restructuring
program.
   Mr. D'Amato characterized himself as "a mixed bag" between
the food and chemicals segments, although he comes from the
division that used to be called chemicals. He noted his
division responsibilities included the company's Brazilian
pasta products and other consumer-products businesses. He
also pointed to the strength in the three other executive
vice presidents who run the food businesses. Mr. D'Amato said
he planned to become "much more aggressive in growth and
acquisitions overseas," continuing to look for acquisitions
and selling some businesses.
   Mr. D'Amato, instrumental in Borden's divestiture of its
commodity chemicals operations, also was elected a director.
He has been with Borden 31 years and will be succeeded as
corporate executive vice president and president of packaging
and industrial products by Joseph M. Saggese. Mr. Saggese, 58
years old, had been senior group vice president of the
division. He also was named to the office of the chairman,
joining Mr. Ventres, Mr. D'Amato and the three other
executive vice presidents.
   John M. McMillin, a food analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities, was impressed by Mr. D'Amato's ability to explain
the dynamics of the wall-coverings business and said he
appeared "street smart" and "production driven."
   Mr. McMillin said that although "Wall Street may be
disappointed with the appointment of a chemical man," Mr.
D'Amato would "slowly gain acceptance." He noted that many of
the analysts who follow Borden are food analysts and know
little about chemicals.
   William Leach, a food industry analyst with Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said, "I've never understood the synergy
between wallpaper and pasta," a reference to Borden's
standing as the biggest company in the world in sales in both
areas. Mr. Leach said most analysts feel Borden would be
worth more if the two aspects of the company were separated.

   Canadian Pacific's
   Spinoff Is Blocked
   By Court Ruling

   TORONTO -- The Supreme Court of Ontario blocked a plan by
Canadian Pacific Ltd. to spin off its real-estate unit to its
common shareholders, saying that holders of preference shares
who aren't included in the transaction would be hurt.
   In his ruling, Justice A.M. Austin said Canadian Pacific's
proposed 767 million Canadian dollar (US$650 million) spinoff
of Marathon Realty Co. wasn't necessary and wouldn't benefit
Canadian Pacific. While the spinoff would enrich Canadian
Pacific's holders of common shares, it would leave fewer
assets in the company from which to pay preference-share
dividends, Mr. Austin said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The judgment was a surprise because Mr. Austin had ruled
on April 23 that holders of preference shares weren't legally
entitled to participate in the spinoff, which was devised as
a dividend to Canadian Pacific's common shareholders. Holders
of preference shares are appealing the April 23 ruling. But
in his latest decision, Mr. Austin said Canadian Pacific also
must show that the spinoff is fair to holders of preference
shares.
   Under Canadian law, Canadian Pacific must obtain court
approval for a spinoff, which represents a "fundamental
change" in the company's corporate structure.
   A lawyer for Canadian Pacific said the Montreal-based
railway, resources, telecommunications and real-estate
concern is studying its options: whether to appeal the
court's decision; submit a revised spinoff plan; provide
other compensation for Canadian Pacific preference-share
holders; or scrap the spinoff plan. The company has 30 days
in which to appeal Mr. Austin's ruling to the Ontario Court
of Appeal, the province's highest court.
   As reported, at Canadian Pacific's annual meeting on May
2, its common shareholders voted 90% in favor of the
company's proposal to spin off 80% of Marathon through a
share distribution.
   Under the plan, Canadian Pacific would keep 20% of
Marathon, but the real estate unit's 99 million shares
outstanding would make it Canada's most widely held public
real-estate concern. Marathon's assets, which have a market
value of more than C$4 billion, include office buildings in
Canada and the U.S. and prime undeveloped land in railway
corridors in downtown Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
   At the annual meeting, common shareholders also narrowly
approved a shareholder-rights plan that would make it
prohibitively expensive to launch a takeover bid for Canadian
Pacific. Observers saw the spinoff of Marathon as another
important anti-takeover measure.
   Holders of Canadian Pacific's preference shares are led by
the Fielding family of Sudbury, Ontario, which holds about
82% of the shares.
   The latest ruling could delay Marathon's debut as a public
company for months if the decision is appealed. For several
weeks, Marathon has been trading in the so-called gray
market, where investors are exchanging promises to buy or
sell the stock after it is listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.
   Marathon shares were quoted yesterday in gray market
trading at C$7.86 to C$8, up from C$7.75 to C$7.86 on Tuesday
when the court ruling was issued. In composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Canadian Pacific common
closed at $18.75, up 25 cents, on volume of 648,300 shares.

   The Other Summit

   As George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev meet today to toast
the end of the Cold War, we hope someone responsible is
keeping an eye on another summit, where all the talk has been
of hot war. Hosting other Arab chiefs in Baghdad, Iraq's
Saddam Hussein has been ranting about "weapons of mass
destruction" and threatening to "burn up half of Israel."
   To be sure, the Iraqi dictator has always prefaced his
remarks with "if Israel attacks us." It may be that his
bluster is intended to preclude a new attack on the nuclear
reactor now being rebuilt after a 1981 Israeli attack. Israel
is widely assumed to have its own nuclear deterrent, which
even Mr. Hussein is not apt to take lightly. His Arab
neighbors might have more to fear; Syria's Assad even refused
to attend the summit. Mr. Hussein also has scores to settle
with Iran.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still, feigning fear of an attack has been the aggressor's
tactic since time immemorial, and Saddam Hussein is not a man
to be easily dismissed. He started the last big war by
invading Iran, after all, and a million lives were lost. He
used the war as an excuse to turn his nation into an armed
camp. Iraq, for example, has a larger air force than Britain.
He has pursued every armament opportunity, like bankrolling
the "supergun" that was apparently foiled by Western
intelligence.
   Most of all, Saddam Hussein does have a capability that
plausibly might wipe out half of Israel in a matter of hours:
Soviet Scud B missiles armed with chemical warheads. What's
more, he demonstrated his willingness to use chemical warfare
against both Iran and his own rebellious Kurds.
   Mr. Hussein's bluster, moreover, has been playing to
applause in much of the Arab world. The pretext for the Arab
summit and other "concern" in the West is the recent flood of
Soviet Jews to Israel. This of course will revitalize Israel.
Demographic trends are being reversed; no longer is it likely
that Arabs will constitute a majority of the nation at some
time in the future. The new immigrants will boost the Israeli
economy, and break the country's political deadlock, probably
in favor of the conservative Likud Party.
   If Saddam Hussein has emerged as the Arab point man for
the new offensive, he is of course being aided in this effort
by Yasser Arafat, who has proposed another scheme. Under it,
Israel would immediately withdraw from the West Bank to be
replaced by U.N. forces, until, as he says, "a final
settlement -- Palestinian sovereignty -- is reached." Mr.
Arafat knows that U.N. forces wouldn't stay long on the West
Bank. The PLO would gain control of the territory without
having to make any meaningful concessions to Israeli
security. Understandably, Israel's Yitzhak Shamir quickly
rejected the U.N. idea.
   Astonishingly, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker has
sent signals that he supports some U.N. role on the West
Bank. The White House also grabbed Mr. Arafat's bait by
dwelling on the phony issue of new Soviet Jewish settlements
on the West Bank. Fewer than 1% of the Soviets have chosen to
settle there; they just emerged from an embattled
environment, and don't want to move to another. President
Bush compounded this by also criticizing settlements in East
Jerusalem, a departure in American rhetoric.
   On April 16, Mr. Arafat went out of his way to praise
President Bush and Secretary Baker for their "good
intentions" in the region. U.S. good intentions
notwithstanding, Palestinian terrorists launched a large
attack via speedboats yesterday against Israeli beach-front
hotels on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. Against a mountain
of proof, the State Department has refused to acknowledge
that the PLO remains implicated in the terrorism. Though
Saddam Hussein has emerged as a brutal dictator, the
administration continues to placate him.
   The tilt toward the Arabs is no doubt part of some arcane
diplomatic strategy by which the State Department hopes to
solve the riddles of the West Bank and 42 years of Middle
East tension. We doubt the White House has any overt
intention of departing from the historic bipartisan consensus
that has committed the United States to Israel's continued
existence. But recent U.S. diplomatic activity in the Middle
East surely creates ambiguities about whether the U.S. would
in fact intervene to support Israel in a military crunch. And
Mr. Hussein is neither a prudent nor cautious man.
   It is of course to be hoped that nothing will come of Mr.
Hussein's threats. But if some fit of anger or madness leads
him to unleash a chemical-weapons assault on Israel,
President Bush and Secretary Baker (and for that matter Mr.
Gorbachev) might face an excruciating decision: Would they
allow another Holocaust to take place on their watch? We
expect the Bush administration would follow the historic
American commitment rather than its own recent bobbing and
weaving. But if so, it might be a good idea for it to let Mr.
Hussein know now rather than stand silent before his
bellicose threats. Ambiguity may be a clever negotiating
ploy, but clarity of American intent is the way to stop war
from happening.

   Brent Scowcroft has said that this week's meeting between

control summit." It will have to do with "what's going on in
the Soviet Union" and "with remaking a political map of
Europe."
   That gets our priorities about right. Moves toward free
economic and political choice in the Soviet empire are
redrawing the political map of all Eurasia. It is these
movements -- not arms agreements -- that are transforming and
reducing the Soviet threats that have preoccupied the West.

   U.S.-Soviet agreements to reduce arms and relocate troops
and equipment not only lag behind the reductions and
withdrawals demanded by the newly independent Eastern
European states (and needed by the shattered Soviet economy)
but have tended to slow them down. Second, arms agreements
focus excessively on two far-fetched contingencies: an
all-out conventional invasion through the center of Europe
and an unrestricted nuclear attack on thousands of targets in
the U.S. They ignore other Soviet threats -- ones that were
always more plausible and now are more transparently so.
   Third, they neglect the increasing dangers presented by
the spread to many countries of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons. And last, arms agreements try
artificially to separate the strategic and the nuclear
systems from theater and nonnuclear systems, even when they
are essentially the same -- as in the Soviet attempt in the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to constrain conventional
cruise missiles we need to meet a wide range of conventional
threats in any of several widely separated theaters.
   Arms control bureaucracies treat arms control essentially
as a technical matter of matching numbers on each side. That
assumes wrongly that Soviet forces are in the center of
Europe only because our forces are there. It ignores the key
difference between NATO and the Warsaw Pact: The Soviets have
inserted troops in Eastern Europe by force, while NATO, a
voluntary organization of free, sovereign democracies, asked
for U.S. troops and can tell them to leave knowing that the
U.S. will do so -- as it did when it withdrew its forces from
France in the mid-1960s.
   Unless U.S. and West European governments misguidedly
negotiate a continuance of the Soviet presence in East
Europe, the new democratic states there can make it
impossible for the Soviets to support their forces
logistically. The Soviets would have to use massive force to
keep them there. This is a most implausible course given
their other troubles. (Agreements can't lock in future Soviet
governments; the new political realities can lock them out.)
It is primarily the governments of Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Poland and Germany that should negotiate the withdrawal of
Soviet forces. West Europe and the U.S. should help mainly by
providing moral support to these governments and perhaps,
like West Germany, help in financing civilian housing and
retraining in the Soviet Union for the demobilized soldiers.
   The main aim of U.S. security policy in Europe should be
to let the democracies in the region decide what foreign
forces they will allow to be located within their own
boundaries. The same objective should animate the arms
agreements the U.S. supports. If the U.S. achieves this goal,
U.S. forces in West Germany will dwindle and Soviet forces in
East Europe will disappear without endangering Soviet
citizens.
   U.S. arms control bureaucracies should also recognize that
it is the Soviet independence movements that will have the
dominant effect, beyond the center of Europe, on Western
interests world-wide.
   In short, arguments that the U.S. must sacrifice the
democratic independence movements inside the Soviet Union in
order to get arms control agreements get things exactly
backward. By doing so, the U.S. would sacrifice or seriously
compromise the movements that are genuinely reducing threats
and making lower defense budgets feasible in return for
agreements that do little or nothing for either purpose.
   The nationalism that moves so many parts of the Soviet
empire toward independence can have its flip side. The U.S.
wants such moves to be peaceful, but they may well be violent
-- especially if repressed.
   The various nationalities are not only hostile to their
communist rulers, but have many old antagonisms among
themselves. But the Politburo is a very implausible defender
of any minority. In fact, it is Mr. Gorbachev's Politburo
that has been stirring up ethnic violence:
   -- In Georgia in April 1989, Moscow authorized the use of
poison gas to end peaceful demonstrations and to incite
Georgian Christians against Moslem Meshketians.
   -- In Azerbaijan, Moscow sent troops to Baku several days
after the Popular Front for Azerbaijan had stopped the
pogroms against Armenians. Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov
admitted that the presence of the troops had nothing to do
with separating the Azeris and Armenians but with the
destruction of the Azerbaijanian independence movement.
   -- In Lithuania, Moscow sent in armored personnel carriers
ostensibly to protect the civil rights of Russian minorities
there; dropped leaflets from helicopters in an attempt to
rally the Russian minorities against the Lithuanians; and
imposed an economic blockade.
   -- In Latvia and Estonia, the Soviet military led
simultaneous unarmed assaults on the legislatures.
   All of these examples provide evidence of Moscow's
continuing attempts to stir ethnic antagonisms and to obscure
the fact that whatever reconciliation these nationalities
need to achieve with each other, they have in common an
unquenchable desire to be free of their Soviet rulers.
   Over the past 70 years, the Soviet Union's leaders have
tried and failed to meld its citizens into one "Homo
sovieticus." They are even less likely to succeed now. Soviet
leaders have had little success in rallying even ethnic
Russians in support of holding on to the empire. Just this
week leaders in the Russian republic held the founding
meeting of the Democratic Party of the Russian Federation,
which favors immediate independence for all of the national
republics and immediate privatization and transition to a
free market.
   The fanfare that greets every announcement by Mr.
Gorbachev that he has sweetened his offer to negotiate about
the secession of various republics cannot conceal the fact
that these concessions are so much smoke.
   Take the case of Lithuania. Mr. Gorbachev has demanded
that before negotiations can begin the Lithuanians must
suspend their declaration of independence, thus admitting
that they are subject to Soviet law. That is the main point
stalling negotiations, but it is sharpened by the fact that
Mr. Gorbachev has designed the two laws that he rushed
through this year so as to make secession essentially
infeasible. One, a new secession law, outlines a nightmare
obstacle course.
   First, it demands that a referendum on secession pass by a
majority of more than two-thirds. This majority must obtain
not only in each republic at large, but in each autonomous
subdivision or "place densely populated by an ethnic group"
within the republic. It's conceivable that Lithuania might be
able to get over this obstacle, but Latvia and Estonia, which
have been extensively colonized by the Soviets and whose
populations have been subject to extensive deportations,
might not.
   Even if they did, independence would then have to be
approved by the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, whose
2,250 members were elected only after the Communist Party had
rigorously screened all proposed candidates. Miraculously, a
few hundred free spirits slipped through the party net, but
not enough to give independence for one of the republics much
of a chance.
   If somehow a republic cleared that second obstacle,
however, Mr. Gorbachev could assure that an application for
independence was withdrawn by using another drastic new law.
Under it, he has the power to impose direct presidential rule
in any of the republics and to replace the local authorities
with his own appointees. The Balts will remember how the
Soviets "replaced" the Hungarian leaders with whom they were
negotiating in 1956 and the leaders of the Prague Spring in
1968.
   Finally, a new republic could secede only if it paid
compensation for Soviet investments in the territory. In
short, Mr. Gorbachev would ask the prisoners to pay for the
costs of their imprisonment.
   For sheer gall this last requirement is the top. Soviet
authorities assert this right of compensation not only in the
relatively rich Baltic republics, but in other republics as
well, including -- as an example -- the impoverished Moslem
republic of Uzbekistan, whose natural endowment Soviet
planners ruined by an enormous ecological disaster -- the
shrinking of the largest inland sea in the world, the Sea of
Aral -- by poisoning the soil with a huge overload of
pesticides, and by destroying human capital through the
extensive use of child labor. Some accountant among the
central planners no doubt is totting up the cost of the
pesticides and the irrigation pipes and trenches that drained
the Sea of Aral. It's as if, instead of paying compensation
to the survivors of Hitler's Final Solution, Germany had
demanded compensation from Israel or from the Diaspora for
the expense of the gas ovens.
   Mr. Gorbachev, as the Communist official answerable to the
party for the economy before he became its leader in March
1985, deserves credit for recognizing the need for drastic
economic restructuring. But he has swung wildly among
attempts to improve central planning, partial ventures into
decentralizing and halfway flirtations with the market and
private ownership.
   Though an increasing number of his advisers have made
clear that nothing short of rapidly freeing markets and
instituting private property rights will do, he has
vacillated and reversed course and never indicated clearly
where he is headed. A master of oxymoron, he last week
launched his latest dash to "free" (regulated) markets. For
all his talk of pluralism and democracy, he has refused to
face the fact that the economic crisis in the Soviet Union
can be solved only by a move to economic freedom, and that
economic freedom is not feasible without political freedom.
   All this suggests that:
   a) Western policy should support a path of evolution in
communist empires rather than specific leaders such as Mr.
Gorbachev or Deng Xiaoping.
   b) While there are sharp limits to what Western
governments can do to encourage paths of decolonization
favorable to Western security and they are most unlikely to
intervene militarily to counter crackdowns, they are not
helpless to affect events.
   c) At a time when communist economies are in trouble,
Western governments can make clear that suppression of
independence movements will slow or stop access to Western
capital markets, technology and other assistance -- just as
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan reduced such access.
(President Bush's statement this week that Soviet treatment
of Lithuania is delaying Most Favored Nation status is a step
in the right direction.)
   d) Western governments can make this clear not only by
private communications but by taking preliminary actions to
delay help. Whatever they say in public should be phrased not
only to minimize the loss of face on the part of communist
leaders, but the loss of credibility on the part of Western
governments.
   e) Western governments should understand that even a
Soviet Union limited to Great Russia would be the most
formidable military power in Eurasia. At the same time, such
a Soviet Union, perhaps joined by other republics in a
voluntary confederation of states modeled on the British
Commonwealth (as Mr. Gorbachev has sometimes suggested),
would drastically reduce threats to U.S., European and
Japanese interests not only in Europe but in Asia and the
Mideast as well in precisely the same way as independence
movements in East Europe have reduced the threat in the
center of Europe.

   Soviets Join
   Air-Safety
   Venture

   A joint venture between two U.S. companies and the Soviet
Union will try to take the guesswork out of navigation during
transoceanic flights, increasing the safety of long flights
and opening the skies to even more planes.
   Currently, commercial airline pilots face some big
headaches when they fly over the ocean. Less than an hour off
the coast, planes lose contact with land-based ground
controllers. After that, their crews must rely on on-board
navigation equipment that's "subject to drift and errors," an
airline official concedes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, pilots are encountering increasing air traffic,
particularly over the Pacific, that one airline official said
was "approaching gridlock."
   To help alleviate those concerns, Honeywell Inc. and NWA
Inc.'s Northwest Airlines unit announced yesterday that they
plan to put sophisticated equipment aboard a Northwest Boeing
747 freighter in a test that taps into both U.S. and Soviet
satellite navigation systems.
   While both satellite systems now leave numerous holes in
the sky, plans call for the countries to launch as many as
two dozen satellites to plug them. Once that's done, most of
the world's long-range aircraft could be equipped with a
single "black box" capable of marrying location data from the
two satellite networks. Pilots would be able to get
second-by-second data about their whereabouts, greatly
decreasing the chances of straying off course.
   One official involved in the experiment speculated that
such a system could have prevented the loss of Korean Air
Lines flight 007, which wandered off its trans-Pacific route
in late 1983 and was shot down by a Russian jet fighter.
   After that disaster, which cost 269 lives, investigators
determined that the KAL pilots probably punched the wrong
navigational coordinates into their on-board computer. That
device had no way of checking that the information was
correct; once airborne, the plane was on its own.
   Such commercial airliner on-board navigation systems rely
primarily on gyroscopes that sense the movement of the
aircraft, allowing pilots to keep track of the plane's
progress. But they "don't have the means of . . . confirming
the position the aircraft is at," according to Robert Buley,
Northwest's manager of flight standards projects who helped
negotiate the venture. As a result, planes can be off course
by a number of miles at any one time.
   Because of the uncertainty, air traffic controllers now
must keep wide spaces between aircraft over the oceans -- 60
miles on each side and about 85 miles before and behind a
plane. Such wide separation is a particular problem in the
Pacific, where air traffic is burgeoning and many carriers
are operating flights during the same hours because of the
big time change.
   Since satellites provide much more precise navigational
information, controllers would be able to reduce the
separation and increase the number of flights over both the
Atlantic and the Pacific without compromising safety.
   By electronically consulting both U.S. and U.S.S.R.
satellite systems "over water, they'd tell you at all times
accuracies within 100 meters," said D. Larry Moore, president
of the space and aviation systems business at Honeywell,
which is a major producer of on-board inertial navigation
systems.
   Both the U.S. and Soviets already have satellite
navigational systems for military use. But because commercial
airlines are held to different safety standards than military
aircraft, use of the satellite systems for commercial jets
remains in the testing stage. What's more, neither country
alone has enough satellites to test the system on a
continuous basis. By combining the two systems, there will be
enough satellites to provide navigational guidance to flights
around the world on a second-by-second basis, as well as to
cross-check information coming from each, officials said.
   The test is expected to last until mid-1993, after which
Northwest and Honeywell will turn their results over to the
Federal Aviation Administration, and presumbly also to the
Russians. Although the FAA has been encouraging international
technical cooperation, officials yesterday estimated that it
may not be until 1995 that the industry moves away from the
current land-based navigational equipment.
   Mr. Moore estimated that the resulting black box, which
his company hopes to make, could cost between $35,000 and
$50,000. "It's going to be the navigation system of the
mid-to-late '90s," he predicted.
   Northwest's Mr. Buley said he broached the idea of a joint
venture with the Soviets when he attended a conference
between U.S. and Soviet aviation technology experts in
Leningrad earlier this year. Northwest is the biggest U.S.
carrier in the North Pacific, and thus has an interest in
ensuring that it can expand its number of flights on
trans-Pacific routes.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Lawmakers Continue to Rake In Speaking Fees,
   With Senators More Cautious Amid Inquiries

   WASHINGTON -- In the face of a torrent of recent ethical
scandals, members of the House and Senate are still happily
grabbing up speaking fees from special-interest groups.
   The pace-setters in 1989, according to congressional
financial disclosure forms, were lawmakers in key leadership
roles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last year, when House members voted themselves a pay
raise, they agreed to forgo honoraria and most other forms of
outside income beginning next January. So it's hardly
surprising that there was something of a feeding frenzy in
1989.
   Senators, by contrast, were generally much more cautious
about taking huge amounts of speaking fees. They accepted a
total of $2 million in honoraria for personal use, a 23% drop
from 1988. The pending ethics investigations of seven
senators, all of whom are facing allegations involving their
ties to special-interest groups or contributors, seems to
have had a chilling effect.
   Once again, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski was the top honoraria recipient. The Chicago
Democrat collected $285,000 in speaking fees last year,
dwarfing the honoraria earned by any other member of
Congress. Many of the special-interest groups that paid to
hear the tax-writing chief have vital economic stakes in the
outcome of his panel's decisions. Citicorp, for instance,
paid $10,500 for a Rostenkowski appearance. Rep. Rostenkowski
gave all but $26,850 of the total to charity. Under House
rules, he could keep only the equivalent of 30% of his House
salary.
   Rep. William Gray, the majority whip, was the runner-up
with $164,098 in honoraria. The Philadelphia Democrat also
was reimbursed for 52 trips by special-interest groups and
others. He pocketed $25,000 in honoraria and donated $139,098
to charities.
   More senators than ever -- 34 -- didn't keep any honoraria
for personal use. That's almost twice the number who resisted
boosting their incomes with special interest speaking fees in
1988, according to an analysis by Common Cause, a citizens
lobby. Many other senators took pains to play down the gifts
and extra income they received.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), for example, reported that
he received a "National League {baseball} pass for the 1989
season that was not used." Sen. Harry Reid (D., Nev.), a
freshman, received "fruit baskets, vegetable plates and
infrequent meals" during stays at two Las Vegas hotels. "None
had a value in excess of $35," Sen. Reid carefully noted.
Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R., N.H.) wrote in a handwritten scrawl
that his trip to Kenya and the Sudan, underwritten by the
Americares Foundation Inc. of Connecticut, "was to encourage
parties to the Sudan Civil War to permit shipment of food to
starving refugees."
   Four senators who face ethics investigations for their
intervention on behalf of savings-and-loan executive Charles
Keating are among those who didn't keep any honoraria for
personal use. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), John Glenn (D.,
Ohio), and Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) didn't accept any
honoraria, while John McCain gave all of the $30,250 he
earned from speeches to charity.
   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), the fifth member of the
so-called Keating Five, earned $52,800 in honoraria, mostly
from lecturing at the Washington Campus, a seminar program
for executives and business students in Washington.
   Sen. David Durenberger, the Minnesota Republican who faces
a public trial in the Senate next month on charges that he
violated Senate rules in a $100,000 book deal and in a
separate real-estate transaction, was among the top Senate
honoraria earners with $62,185. He kept $35,785.
   Sen. Durenberger also amended his disclosure filings from
previous years to include $484,000 he received from a
Minnesota bank in 1988 as a bridge loan on his McLean, Va.,
residence and to include free lodging he accepted at the
Florida condominium of a friend over the past three Christmas
holidays. He reported that these items had been inadvertently
omitted from his previous filings.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), the other senator facing
ethics charges for various ties to campaign contributors,
received $42,000 in honoraria, as well as trips financed by
special-interest groups, including the Securities Industry
Association. He kept $35,800 of the honoraria -- the legal
limit of 40% of the 1990 Senate salary of $89,500.
   The honoraria leader in the Senate was Minority Leader
Robert Dole (R., Kan.), who earned $108,900 in honoraria and
kept just under the legal limit. The rest went to a long list
of charities. Sen. Dole, who also led the pack in 1987,
grossed a much more modest $67,750 in honoraria in 1988.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine)
received $50,000 in honoraria, not quite enough to push him
into the top 10. He kept $39,000. (Sen. Mitchell's bigger
take is based on his larger salary of $99,500 as majority
Leader).
   There were amusing nuggets buried in some of the
disclosures: Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) received $657 in
royalties for appearing in an episode of "The Cosby Show."
According to an aide, Mr. Bradley portrayed a doctor
colleague of Cliff Huxtable, the character played by comedian
Bill Cosby, and was seen playing basketball during the show,
which was broadcast on Feb. 23, 1989; Sen. Robert Byrd (D.,
W.Va.) received $120 in royalties for a record album of
fiddle tunes he recorded in the late 1970s; Sen. Dole
received 14 neckties from Baroness Sophie Vavlitis, of New
York, while Sen. Bob Graham (D., Fla.) reported he accepted a
one-person sleeper sofa valued at $1,500 from Theresa Castro,
of Ocala, Fla.
   Honoraria are paid by many different companies and
organizations. Lawmakers may pocket only $2,000 per speech.
Some groups, including Autrenet, a New York brokerage
company, invite senators to speak on two successive days, for
a total of $4,000. The Tobacco Institute, a trade association
of cigarette manufacturers, shows up repeatedly on the
disclosure forms, as does Connell Co., Westfield, N.J.
Company chairman Grover Connell, a multimillionaire commodity
merchant, said he gave $104,000 to 52 House and Senate
members last year.
   House and Senate members can donate their honoraria to
almost any nonprofit organization. Assistant House Minority
Leader Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.), for example, gave $29,304 to
the Atlanta Zoo and plans to fund a reading program in the
Georgia public schools with his 1990 honoraria.
   In general, committee chairmen and those in leadership
positions received the most speaking fees. Rep. Gingrich, who
rose to a leadership position in 1989, more than doubled his
honoraria to $67,491 last year from a 1988 level of only
$28,550. But House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) drew only
a modest $32,000 in honoraria, pocketed $27,000 and gave
$5,000 to charity.

   Tonka Corp. Expects
   A Significant Loss
   In Second Quarter

   MINNETONKA, Minn. -- Tonka Corp. said it expects to post a
"significant" second-quarter loss because of lower sales and
that it might post a loss for the full year as well.
   The toy maker said sales of some fad toy lines have been
lower than expected, failing to take up the slack from the
company's popular Real Ghostbusters line, which is petering
out after three strong years of sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales from 1989 also included a video game line that has
been discontinued.
   Tonka said it now is doubtful that its revenue will exceed
last year's $870.5 million, and that the company is in talks
with its banks to relax some debt covenants that the company
could be in violation of. "We are clearly disappointed by the
current outlook," Stephen G. Shank, chairman and chief
executive officer, said, "and are examining every option to
improve performance for the balance of the year."
   A spokeswoman attributed the sales decline to a series of
relatively small disappointments in the fad toy line, which
promotes toys tied to movies and other phenomena through
Tonka's Kenner Products unit. Tonka wouldn't identify the
items not selling well, she said, for fear that sales would
be further hurt by identifying the lines as slow sellers.
   In the year-earlier second quarter, Tonka had profit of
$100,000, or two cents a share, on sales of $189.4 million.
Tonka wouldn't project results for the current quarter.
   For all of 1989, Tonka had profit of $5.7 million, or 67
cents a share, after a $2 million charge.
   Tonka expects a profitable second half for 1990, but now
isn't sure whether that will be enough to offset the
first-half loss. For this year's first quarter, Tonka had a
$10.3 million loss, or 71 cents a share, on revenue of $135.9
million.
   International sales and sales of Parker Brothers games are
above last year's levels, Tonka said. In addition to the fad
lines, sales in the Tonka Products division, which makes toy
trucks, Play-doh and other general items, are off.

   First American Corp.
   Dismisses Top Officer
   Amid Earnings Woes

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- First American Corp., struggling with
problem loans, dismissed its chairman, president and chief
executive officer, Kenneth L. Roberts.
   The banking company said James F. Smith Jr., 60 years old,
currently vice chairman, will fill Mr. Roberts' positions
until a successor can be found.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Problems at First American, which has seen its earnings
fall drastically in recent quarters, reached a head three
weeks ago when the company posted a loss of $44.8 million, or
$1.94 a share, for the first quarter, compared with net
income of $15.4 million, or 67 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. The loss, the company said, stemmed from
a $94.4 million provision for possible loan losses after net
charge-offs of $60.8 million of loans, primarily related to
real estate.
   The results prompted First American to eliminate its
dividend for the second quarter of this year.
   First American said Mr. Roberts was dismissed by "mutual
agreement" between himself and the board. Neil Cunningham,
executive vice president, said the departure "obviously" was
connected to First American's recent performance, but he
declined to comment further.
   Mr. Roberts, 57, couldn't be reached for comment. He
joined First American in 1976, and was named chairman and
chief executive in 1979.
   He is the second top executive to leave First American
during the past year. In August, the company's president and
chief operating officer, Andrew Higgins, resigned. While no
reason was given for his departure, it coincided with a major
revision downward in second-quarter earnings. At the time,
Mr. Roberts assumed the position of president.
   Mr. Roberts' dismissal "wasn't surprising, given recent
developments at First American," said Henry J. Coffey Jr., an
analyst at J.C. Bradford &amp; Co. in Nashville. Added Jon Burke
at Robinson Humphrey Co. in Atlanta: "It was a hard decision,
but it appears to be the right one."

   Judge Finds U.S.
   Violating the Law
   In Disability Cases
   ----

   NEW YORK -- A federal judge said the Department of Health
and Human Services is violating the law in the way it
processes many Social Security disability claims. The
decision could force the U.S. to reconsider tens of thousands
of applicants who have been turned down for disability
benefits.
   Judge Leonard Sand said he will order Social Security
officials to change their policy for processing the
applications. The suit was filed in 1984 after the Reagan
administration began taking a harsh approach to most
applications for mental and physical disability benefits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the Reagan administration approach, called
non-acquiescence, federal officials rejected disability
applications, although courts had ruled that the procedures
they used were wrong. As a result, thousands of people were
rejected for benefits without ever being informed that in
similar cases a federal appeals court had ruled that the
process used was inappropriate.
   Because most of the applicants are poor people without
lawyers, they usually never learn that they had grounds for
challenging the benefit rejections, said Burt Neuborne, a New
York University law school professor who helped bring the
case when he was legal director for the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   Under the disputed policy, the applicants could be
disqualified for benefits for various reasons. In some cases,
for instance, the opinion of the Social Security
Administration's own doctors were given more weight than the
applicants' regular physicians. Judge Sand, in federal
district court in Manhattan, found that and other guidelines
to be illegal.
   The judge said that although the department had revised
its policy in 1985, apparently in response to the litigation,
the procedure for granting claims "leaves a great deal of
room for non-acquiescence." The judge said the policy allows
the agency to continue avoiding complying with previous
holdings by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The agency has maintained that it hasn't engaged in any
form of non-acquiescence in disability cases at least since
1985.
   Judge Sand said a plan has to be worked out to remedy any
harm caused by the policy. The remedy could involve reopening
disability cases that were rejected as long ago as 1981. But
Judge Sand rejected a proposal by the benefit applicants'
attorneys to reopen all the cases. Instead, he ordered the
attorneys to come up with a narrower plan. He said the plan
should cover cases that were rejected for the specific
reasons now found to have been in violation of previous court
rulings.
   Attorneys working on the case said it is impossible to
predict how many cases might be affected and how much money
might be involved. Prof. Neuborne said a small percentage of
rejected applicants did appeal cases involving the disputed
policy and that nearly all of them won. Generally the
benefits at stake amount to about $500 a month for each
individual.
   Nancy Morawetz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said she
expects a remedy plan to be approved within two or three
months.
   A spokesman for the Justice Department, which represented
the Health and Human Services Department, said attorneys are
reviewing Judge Sand's opinion. He said they have no comment
at this time.
   Prof. Neuborne said the Social Security Administration
adopted the policy of non-acquiescence because it believed
that its interpretation of the law, rather than the federal
appeals court's intrepretation, was correct. Instead of
incorporating the court rulings into its policy, the agency
required that each individual applicant go to court to
challenge the decisions. Prof. Neuborne said the policy was
one of the first "to use non-acquiescence against people who
couldn't afford lawyers."
   Judge Sand said the applicants had no reason to believe
their requests were being rejected in ways courts previously
had found to be invalid. Under Judge Sand's decision, the
Social Security Administration's policy will have to be
changed to state that the previous court rulings are binding.

   NEW YORK -- A federal judge has asked the U.S. attorney's
office to review whether a free-lance reporter working for
Forbes magazine misrepresented himself as a New York City
police officer.
   The reporter, John Connolly, says he was a New York City
policeman from 1965 to 1976.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise said in a May 22
letter that Mr. Connolly had recently presented a policeman's
badge to obtain access to sealed affidavits in the case of a
lawsuit filed by the former president of entertainer Merv
Griffin's Griffin Co. Michael Nigris Jr. filed suit against
Griffin in November, charging that he was fired in a breach
of his contract. Mr. Nigris helped put together the deal for
Griffin Co. to buy Resorts International, the hotel and
casino concern, two years ago.
   In a letter to attorneys for both Mr. Nigris and Griffin
Co., Judge Debevoise said he learned later that Mr. Connolly
doesn't currently work for the police and "may be
disseminating information derived from the affidavits."
   Judge Debevoise could not be reached for comment.
   Mr. Connolly in an interview said he examined documents in
the case before they were officially sealed by the judge on
March 9. He said he never flashed a cop's badge. "I never
even spoke to the judge," Mr. Connolly said. "His clerk
handed me the documents." In the June 11 issue of Forbes, Mr.
Connolly and Forbes staff writer/editor Richard L. Stern
co-authored a story entitled "How Merv Griffin got taken to
the cleaners," which claims Mr. Nigris had ties to organized
crime.
   James Michaels, editor of Forbes, defended Mr. Connolly
and the magazine's story, saying, "No sealed documents were
fraudulently obtained."
   Michael Chertoff, first assistant U.S. attorney in Newark,
would not confirm his office has received the letter from
Judge Debevoise, but said the case "will be reviewed if it's
a violation of the law. Any time a matter is referred by a
judge to this office for review, it will be reviewed."

   Over-the-counter stocks gained slightly as ardor for
technology shares cooled a bit.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.26 to 458.77, a 0.28%,
gain, matching the rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Advancing stocks continued to lead over declining shares,
1,041 to 923, as volume rose to 169.4 million from 134
million Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I saw them take everything a little too fast and too soon
right at the opening," said James Tarantino, head of OTC
trading at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco. The Nasdaq
Composite Index gained more than 2 points by midmorning
before fading. "That left {stocks} vulnerable later in the
day," Mr. Tarantino said, adding that he saw some
"nervousness" in late-afternoon trading.
   Technology shares are beginning to falter with the
approach of summer, typically a slow season for the computer
industry, according to two managers of technology funds.
"Summer generally is not a good time to own tech stocks,"
said William Keithler, manager of the $75 million Financial
Dynamics Fund of Denver-based Financial Programs.
   Larry Bowman, manager of the Fidelity Select Computer Fund
and Fidelity Select Technology Fund, Boston, explains that
summer demand for computer wares are particularly weak in
Europe, where August is a big vacation month. Typically
there's a sell-off in technology shares by the end of the
summer, when computer companies are reporting weak revenue,
Mr. Keithler added.
   Mr. Keithler and Mr. Bowman said they've already begun
paring back their technology holdings, taking profits in
stocks they think have become too expensive and holding on to
shares of companies with strong earnings-growth momentum.
Both men said they are selling shares of Apple Computer.
   Mr. Bowman, who noted that the last quarter of the year is
typically a strong one for technology stocks, said he's
holding on to issues of Pyramid Technology, Quantum, Applied
Materials, MCI, Maxtor and Intelligent Electronics. Mr.
Keithler said he likes LSI Logic, Seagate Technology and
Intel.
   Shares of Adobe Systems continued to trade heavily,
falling 2 1/2 to 35 3/8 on 3.7 million shares. Technology
analyst Peter D. Schleider of Wessels, Arnold &amp; Henderson,
Minneapolis, said in an interview he downgraded his
investment opinion on the Mountain View, Calif., software
maker to "hold" from "buy."
   Mr. Schleider said that given Adobe's surprise revenue
outlook last week, along with his earnings estimate for the
company, he thinks the stock is fairly valued at $30 a share,
but no higher. The analyst pointed out that Adobe has been
losing some market share for inexpensive software for
printers to Hewlett-Packard and isn't expected to come out
with a competitive product until the fourth quarter. He
estimates that Adobe will earn $1.65 a share in fiscal 1990,
ending in November, and $2.45 in 1991. But, he added, the
company must do well in the next two quarters to reach those
levels. In the long run, however, he said that he believes
Adobe "is a very solid company."
   Elmwood Federal Savings rose 1/4 to 13 1/4. Susquehanna
Bancshares of Lititz, Pa., said it will now buy the Media,
Pa., bank in a stock swap valued at about $15.85 a share,
down from an indicated value of about $19 a share agreed to
in November. The revised terms call for an exchange of shares
at a rate of 0.88 Susquehanna share for each for each Elmwood
share outstanding. Susquehanna said the price was reduced "in
light of recent changes in the market for bank stocks."
   Psicor gained 1/4 to 8 1/2 after the San Diego, Calif.,
medical service company said that Diatek Inc. will develop
for Psicor a data base management system used in surgery.
   Immucor rose 1/4 to 14 3/4 after the Norcross, Ga., maker
of blood-bank reagent systems and related products said late
Tuesday it plans to acquire its German distributor, Immucor
G.m.b.H, which markets blood collection bags and Immucor's
products.
   First American (Tennessee) advanced 1 to 14 3/4 after the
Nashville, Tenn., bank named vice chairman James F. Smith Jr.
to replace chairman, president and chief executive officer
Kenneth L. Roberts on an interim basis.
   Goulds Pumps added 3/4 to 21 3/4. Goldman Sachs analyst
Thomas G. Burns Jr. spoke positively about the stock, Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report said. The company's chief
financial officer, John Morphy, told DJPIR there weren't any
corporate developments to account for the rise, but said he
was comfortable with Mr. Burns's estimates that Goulds will
earn $1.50 a share in 1990 and $1.70 a share in 1991, up from
$1.41 in 1989.
   Office Depot tumbled 2 1/4 to 18 3/4 on nearly eight times
average volume. The Boca Raton, Fla., operator of office
supply stores said that sales for the second quarter ending
in June will be lower than originally expected. The company
said it plans to open nine new stores in the quarter, but
several will open later than anticipated. Office Depot also
said that gross margins are being hurt by pricing
competitiveness, but it hopes to offset that weakness in
other ways.
   Survival Technology slid 1/2 to 9 3/4 after the Bethesda,
Md., medical technology concern said two-thirds of its common
stock outstanding was left to the Stanley J. Sarnoff
Endowment for Cardiovascular Science Inc. by Dr. Sarnoff, the
company's founder, who died May 23. The company's board
elected James H. Miller, president, to succeed Dr. Sarnoff as
chief executive.
   Rax Restaurants dipped 1/4 to 2 1/8. The Columbus, Ohio,
chain of fast food restaurants reported that the loss in the
fiscal third quarter ended April 30 narrowed to 10 cents a
share from a loss of 27 cents a year earlier.

   Prenatal Surgery Saves Two Infants
   From Possibly Fatal Congenital Hernia

   SAN FRANCISCO -- A team of physicians at the University of
California Medical Center here performed delicate prenatal
surgery that saved two infants from a potentially fatal
congenital defect.
   It is the first time doctors anywhere have reported
success in fetal surgery to correct the problem -- a
diaphragmatic hernia, or hole in the muscle wall dividing the
chest from the abdomen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such hernias occur in about one of every 2,200 babies
born. Although children suffering from such hernias may
undergo surgery after birth, they stand only a 25% chance of
survival using this approach. This is because pressure forces
internal organs up through the hernia and into the chest
space, crowding and stunting the growth of the fetal lungs so
they cannot support life outside the womb.
   The prenatal surgery has previously been used to correct
urinary obstructions, but doctors termed the hernia repair
about 10 times more difficult to perform.
   Drs. Michael Harrison and Mitchell Golbus and their
colleagues at the University of California reported the first
successful patient to undergo such surgery is now nine months
old and doing well. A second infant now is six weeks old.
Their report is published in the current issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   "We're extremely proud of these kids. It was a terrible
struggle and they were heroic," Dr. Harrison said, flanked by
both families at a news conference.
   At the news conference, Dr. Harrison added the team has
spent 12 years of intense and sometimes frustrating work
developing and testing the technique using fetal lambs and
monkeys. Prior to June 1989, the surgery was attempted on six
infants who died, four of them due to effects of the hernia
on the liver and umbilical vein.
   About a year ago, the team worked out problems in
diagnosis, anesthesia and organ replacement. They had refined
ways to preserve the fetal blood supply during surgery, and
to prevent preterm labor afterward. Last June, what was to be
the first successful hernia repair was undertaken to save the
24-week-old fetus of Beth and Rick Schultz of Chelsea, Mich.
   "I was scared because I had never had surgery," Mrs.
Schultz said yesterday. But chances of {the baby} surviving
long enough to have the surgery after birth weren't good."
   After anesthetizing mother and fetus together, surgeons
made an incision in the mother's abdomen. They opened the
uterus, partially removing the fetus from the womb and making
a small cut under his ribs. The fetal stomach and other
organs were taken out of the chest, and replaced in the
abdomen where they belonged. Then the diaphragm was repaired
with a small fabric patch. The fetal abdomen, too small to
accommodate all organs in their proper place, also was
enlarged with a fabric patch. The entire procedure took 54
minutes.
   Seven weeks after surgery, Blake Schultz was born by
Caesarian section, about six weeks premature. At nine months
old, he weighs 14 pounds. Passed from Dr. Harrison to his
parents, Blake squirmed, generally upstaged his surgeon, and
punctuated the news conference with a series of squeals.
   A second baby, Devona Anderson, the daughter of Stephen
Anderson and Lora Scott of Tacoma, Wash., underwent the
operation March 3. At six weeks old, she slept unperturbed
through her press debut in her parents arms.
   Drs. Harrison and Golbus said the fetal surgery, at
$18,000, costs far less than the $50,000 necessary to perform
surgery after birth due to the intensive-care-unit stay that
follows the later procedure.
   Asked about the debate over pitting such high-tech
procedures against cheap and basic prenatal care, Dr. Golbus
countered: "This in no way denigrates prenatal care. They're
both necessary to have the healthiest possible cadre of
newborns."
   Still, Dr. Harrison said only one in 10 babies thus
afflicted will become candidates for the rare procedure. "I
don't think it will ever be routine. The disease is rare.
{The procedure} is hard to accomplish," he said. "But it will
save a few babies' lives."
   Moreover, he said he was concerned that "as a surgeon and
an admitted enthusiast, we might talk parents into it. They
need to talk to the skeptics, too."
   In the future, he said, the team may attempt to use such
surgery to correct certain other congenital defects, such as
tumors that steal the fetal blood supply, or malformations of
the lung.
   Dr. Golbus said fetal surgery may one day be combined with
techniques of gene-therapy to perform genetic repairs before
birth. "It's harder conceptually," he said, "but easier
mechanically. You're talking about thousands of babies,
instead of the few babies with surgically correctible
lesions" of the kind presented yesterday. en

   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
a federal judge ordered Thomas James Associates Inc., its
former president and a director to repay $1.5 million in
connection with four initial public offerings underwritten by
the firm in 1989.
   The order stems from an SEC complaint in March charging
the Rochester, N.Y., concern with undisclosed domination of
the market for four companies' stocks. The suit also charged
that the securities firm used "fraudulent and high-pressure
sales techniques" to inflate demand for the stocks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of the $1.5 million payment ordered by the federal
district court in Rochester, $300,000 is to be paid by Thomas
James Associates; $800,000 by Brian Thomas, former president
of the firm; and $400,000 by James Villa, a 50% owner of the
firm and a member of its board. Mr. Thomas also agreed to
accept a lifetime ban from the securities industry, the SEC
said.
   The SEC alleged a scheme involving the shares of Sunrise
Technologies Inc., Phoenix Laser Systems Inc., Megamation
Inc. and International Superconductor Corp. The agency said
Thomas James Associates generated about $4.5 million in
undisclosed excessive mark-ups by purchasing securities from
customers at arbitrary prices and reselling them to other
customers at arbitrary prices.
   Thomas James Associates and Mr. Villa didn't return phone
calls seeking comment. Mr. Thomas couldn't be reached for
comment.

   NEW YORK -- Fitch Investors Service Inc. pared its ratings
on Citicorp's senior and subordinated debt and its preferred
stock, while affirming the banking giant's commercial-paper
rating.
   Citicorp called the move somewhat disappointing, noting
that on Tuesday, another rating concern, Duff &amp; Phelps,
affirmed its Duff-1-plus rating on Citicorp's commercial
paper, "along with ratings for our senior debt, subordinated
debt and preferred stock that are basically in line with
Standard &amp; Poor's {Corp.} and now with Fitch."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The weakening economic environment" is hurting the
commercial real-estate sector and "highly leveraged
borrowers," Fitch said in announcing the downgrade. Fitch
added that Citicorp's $8.4 billion refinancing portfolio of
loans to less-developed countries "continues to be
under-reserved relative to other international lenders."
   Fitch ratings fell on Citicorp's senior debt to
double-A-minus from double-A; on subordinated debt to
single-A-plus from double-A-minus; and on preferred stock to
single-A from single-A-plus. Fitch affirmed the
commercial-paper rating at F-1-Plus.
   The Fitch downgrades affect about $15 billion of senior
debt, $3 billion of subordinated debt and $1.8 billion of
preferred stock. It affirmed ratings on about $5 billion in
commercial paper.
   "While disappointing in some aspects," Citicorp said,
"Fitch's comments are extremely positive in citing Citicorp's
diversified income stream and consistently strong global
consumer-business profits."

   INDIANAPOLIS -- Robert Fitzgerald, like most art dealers,
has never dealt in Van Goghs or Renoirs or Matisses. His is
the other world of art -- a few blocks or a few thousand
miles removed from MOMA and Madison Avenue -- where lesser
works, some of insignificant, obscure or dubious provenance,
make their way to market.
   Even so, the sizzling market for art of all kinds has been
good to Mr. Fitzgerald. More than 20 years ago he discovered
that the clay artifacts he could pick up for a pittance in
South America sold for much bigger profits in Los Angeles
than the exotic animals he was pursuing in treks through the
rain forest. Since then, the smooth-talking, 53-year-old
dealer, who tools around Indianapolis in his Jaguar, has been
jetting around the globe, tracking down and acquiring
desirable works for smaller museums and rich individual
collectors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Mr. Fitzgerald's niche in the art market, it hasn't
always hurt business that some people think of him as an
engaging rogue. Says Indianapolis dealer Peg Goldberg, a big
loser in dealings with Mr. Fitzgerald: "He's one of the most
fascinating creatures on two legs. He can tell stories and
jokes and sing nightclub songs nonstop. His typical story:
He's smuggling guns into some Latin country for the CIA and
taking pre-Columbian art out."
   Says Mr. Fitzgerald: "If you spend any time in Latin
America, people think you must be with the CIA, so I just go
along with it." He also says: "I'm not as pure as the driven
snow. The art business is a tough business." And: "I'm only
guilty of making a profit."
   Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and Indiana
law-enforcement officers say otherwise. They say he is a
crook. But he was never accused of a crime until 1989, when
he was charged in Marion County Superior Court in
Indianapolis with masterminding a 1984 theft of African and
other objects of art. Valued at $100,000 to $200,000, the art
was stolen from a doctor's home. Mr. Fitzgerald has pleaded
not guilty; his trial is scheduled for June.
   The dealer vigorously maintains his innocence. "If I were
going to steal, why go after a little collector like the
doctor?" he asks. "I'd go after a big collector worth
millions."
   If nothing else, however, his career illustrates other
aspects of the netherworld of art. Few dealers may outright
steal, but people in the business say many have, with
impunity, misrepresented the age, provenance or quality of
antiquities they sell, charged wildly inflated prices, and
handled art works that others have stolen, smuggled or faked.
Often the deals are done in a rush, with few questions asked.
All this has made the world of art a dangerous place for
unwary collectors and investors.
   The skyrocketing prices on works of art have brought a big
rise in art theft around the world. The International
Foundation for Art Research in New York circulates a periodic
bulletin describing missing works. For the past three years,
the number reported has exceeded 1,000 a year, up from about
700 a year in the mid-1980s and 500 a year in the early
1980s.
   Rarely have authorities penetrated the sophisticated rings
of thieves and fences who dispose of these pieces, some of
them so well-known that their purchasers dare not risk
displaying them to others. Few works are quickly recovered. A
missing Picasso recently turned up in Miami when a New York
dealer tried to buy it for $300,000, but it had been stolen
from a Baltimore apartment 20 years ago.
   There is also a thriving market in the U.S. for
pre-Columbian art -- not stolen, exactly, but looted from
ancient tombs and then smuggled from Latin American countries
in violation of their laws, and in some cases U.S. law.
Recently the discovery of gold artifacts in the tombs of
Moche civilization noblemen in Peru has touched off even more
looting and smuggling. Last year, a Los Angeles dealer was
convicted and sentenced to prison for smuggling Moche art.
   As it turns out, Mr. Fitzgerald has acted as a middleman
in a number of questionable art transactions.
   Born in Toledo, he moved to Los Angeles in his early 20s.
From there, he says, he began roving in South America to
capture jaguars, parrots and other animals for sale to
collectors. On one trip, he says, he bought a batch of
pre-Columbian pots in Peru for $200 and sold them to a
gallery in Los Angeles for nearly $8,000. "I said, `Goodbye,
animal business,'" he recalls.
   By the time the U.S. had begun clamping down on the
smuggling of certain pre-Columbian antiquities in the 1980s,
Mr. Fitzgerald had discovered Africa. And he had moved to
Indianapolis -- partly, he says, to be closer to Harrison
Eiteljorg, a client who with his help has assembled a notable
collection of African art. Mr. Fitzgerald had also changed
his name, from Jones to Fitzgerald. He says Jones was the
name of the grandparents who raised him, and Fitzgerald his
parents'.
   Another dealer says that Bob Jones had come to be viewed
with some misgivings by colleagues. "Everybody has a Bob
Jones story, or three or four," says Al Stendahl, a Los
Angeles dealer in pre-Columbian art. "He is a
wheeler-dealer."
   As Mr. Fitzgerald, he had his first brush with
international notoriety in 1987, after a Parisian dealer,
Michel de Bry, discovered a seven-inch statue that supposedly
had served Michelangelo himself as the model for celebrated
"David." Through another dealer, in Amsterdam, Mr. Fitzgerald
learned that Mr. de Bry needed cash and would sell the
mini-Michelangelo. Mr. de Bry agreed to sell a half-interest
to the Amsterdam dealer and Mr. Fitzgerald for $3 million.
   Mr. Fitzgerald recalls whipping out his checkbook in
Europe and writing a postdated check for $3 million on his
account at a Florida savings and loan association. Could the
check have cleared, even on the future date? "Hell, no]" Mr.
Fitzgerald says -- unless, as he had hoped, he could persuade
a certain client to cover it and acquire an interest in the
statue. The client came to London. But the deal fell through.
Mr. Fitzgerald says Mr. de Bry failed to show clear title to
the statue, a claim Mr. de Bry disputes. Both dealers wound
up suing each other; the litigation has never been concluded.
   Mr. Fitzgerald's dealer friend in Amsterdam was Michel van
Rijn. In May 1988, a year after the abortive Michelangelo
deal, Mr. Fitzgerald and Ms. Goldberg, his dealer
acquaintance from Indianapolis, went to Amsterdam and there
discussed some rare Byzantine mosaics that Mr. van Rijn knew
were for sale by a collector in Munich. Ms. Goldberg says she
fell in love with the mosaics when she saw photographs of
them, depicting Christ, an archangel and two Apostles.
   Ms. Goldberg said she would buy the mosaics for possible
resale. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. van Rijn would act as brokers
in selling the mosaics to her.
   The Munich collector, Ms. Goldberg was told by the two
men, was ill, and needed cash fast -- $3 million in cash. "I
said, `Get serious,' " Ms. Goldberg recalls, "and I finally
negotiated the price down to about $1 million." Even so, "Bob
was screaming and having a nervous breakdown," asserting, she
says, that he couldn't afford to broker the sale at such a
low price.
   Convinced that the two dealers were making little or no
commission, Ms. Goldberg agreed to give each of them 22.5% of
any resale profit and 5% to their lawyer. Mr. Fitzgerald and
Ms. Goldberg then met the Munich collector in Geneva and
inspected the mosaics. Ms. Goldberg, who had arranged for
credit at a Swiss bank, says she went to the bank, drew out
$1,080,000 in $100 bills, and gave the money to Mr.
Fitzgerald and his attorney, who packed it in two gym bags.
   According to undisputed testimony in subsequent litigation
in federal court in Indianapolis, the two men then went to a
Geneva hotel and paid the Munich collector, but only
$350,000. Of the $730,000 remaining, $150,00 went for legal
fees, $282,500 to Mr. van Rijn, and $297,500 to Mr.
Fitzgerald. The money for himself and Mr. van Rijn was simply
their commission, Mr. Fitzgerald says. "I was only making
this much," he says, holding his thumb and forefinger close
together -- "compared to the $20 million (in resale profits)
Peg was going to make." After collecting his commission, Mr.
Fitzgerald sold his interest in the resale profits to an
Indianapolis man for $375,000. That brought Mr. Fitzgerald's
total gain in the deal to more than $670,000.
   Ms. Goldberg feels deceived. "I never would have given a
share in the resale profits if I had thought they were making
an upfront commission," she says.
   Ms. Goldberg took the mosaics back to Indianapolis and
offered them to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles for $20
million. But the Getty had no interest in Byzantine mosaics
-- and museum officials immediately suspected that the
sixth-century antiquities were the ones that had been looted
from a church on Cyprus after Turkey invaded and occupied
part of the island in 1974. The museum alerted the Greek
Cypriot government, which sued Ms. Goldberg in federal court
in Indianapolis to recover the mosaics. Last year a federal
judge ordered them returned to Cyprus. Ms. Goldberg has
appealed the order.
   None of the dealers involved say they had any reason to
suspect that the mosaics had been stolen. Other authorities
say it seems strange that the sale was concluded in only a
few days and that no one took the time to verify the
provenance of the mosaics before Ms. Goldberg acquired them.
   Mr. Fitzgerald's most serious problem also began in 1988,
with the publicized recovery of a stolen painting. In June,
Mike Nichol, a dealer in Bremen, Ind., gave Mr. Fitzgerald
and Jerry Mulholland, a small-time Cincinnati coin dealer, a
check for $72,000 in return for an American Impressionist
painting that Mr. Nichol was buying for a New Mexico dealer.
Mr. Fitzgerald had represented Jacob Schott of Cincinnati as
the owner of the painting and said the sale had to be kept
quiet. "Fitz said that the painting was on the market because
of an upcoming divorce and that the owner did not want the
painting in auction, or appearing in an advertisement, for
several years," Mr. Nichol says.
   But when the New Mexico dealer saw his new acquisition, he
thought he recognized it as one that had been reported
stolen, and told Mr. Nichol he was calling the FBI. The
bureau began an investigation, eventually cracking a ring of
thieves that had been stealing art from rich Cincinnati
households for years. Two of the defendants, Messrs.
Mulholland and Schott, pleaded guilty to federal charges of
interstate transportation of stolen goods. They were fined
and given brief prison sentences.
   Mr. Fitzgerald denies any knowledge that the painting he
helped sell through Mr. Nichol was stolen. "I was duped," he
says. He wasn't charged in the Cincinnati case. But the FBI
was on a new casehis.
   In Mr. Schott's home in Cincinnati, agents had found an
Oriental rug that had been stolen, with many other art
pieces, from the home of Hanus Grosz in Indianapolis in 1984.
Mr. Schott told the agents that Mr. Fitzgerald had planned
the Grosz theft.
   The FBI made Mr. Mulholland, the coin dealer, an
informant. Agents concealed an electronic recorder in his
clothing and sent him to see Mr. Fitzgerald last year. A
transcript of their conversation in the possession of
authorities shows that Mr. Mulholland referred to art from
Dr. Grosz's house, and mentioned other names. "I don't want
any names mentioned around the house . . .," Mr. Fitzgerald
said.
   "Well, that's why we went outside," Mr. Mulholland said.
   "The FBI have very sophisticated equipment and they could
put it in the driveway now and you're out there mentioning
names," Mr. Fitzgerald went on. "I asked you not to do that a
million times. It'll hang you."
   Mr. Fitzgerald explains the conversation this way: He
dislikes mentioning names because they could implicate him
mistakenly in some sort of shady business. "I have enough
trouble," he says. "I don't need any more." He says Messrs.
Schott and Mulholland got short prison sentences for
cooperating with federal agents, and so, he says, "They'll
name anybody."
   The FBI's case against Mr. Fitzgerald in the Indianapolis
theft was turned over to Indiana authorities.
   Even those who may have been taken by Mr. Fitzgerald are
amazed at the theft charges against him. Ms. Goldberg, the
dealer who bought the stolen mosaics, says she may sue Mr.
Fitzgerald if she loses her legal battle to retain them. But,
she says, "I can't believe Bob was involved in any theft."
   Mr. Nichol, who has already filed suit against Mr.
Fitzgerald to recover the money he paid for the stolen
painting, says that he is "absolutely convinced Bob had
nothing to do with {the theft}. . . . It's totally unlike
Bob. He would run away from that kind of deal with track
shoes."
   Mr. Fitzgerald fervently agrees. "I'm super careful," he
says. "I ask where pieces come from. You know they don't fall
out of the sky."

   PARIS -- French consumer prices rose 0.4% in April from
March and were up 3.2% from a year earlier, according to
definitive results announced yesterday by the National
Statistics Institute.
   The definitive results confirm previously released
preliminary data. They follow a monthly rise of 0.3% for
March, when the year-on-year growth rate was 3.4%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the preliminary data, the definitive result
included a breakdown of price growth by product category.
This showed that service prices led the monthly gain with a
rise of 0.8% from March. This advance had been widely
anticipated because the index for the first month of every
calendar quarter includes housing and rent increases that
generally add about 0.1% to the monthly growth rate for the
overall index.

   To Take Charge
   Of $126.5 Million

   LONG GROVE, Ill. -- Kemper Corp. said it will take a
$126.5 million charge to pare down its securities brokerage
division, in what analysts said was a belated recognition of
problems.
   The second-quarter after-tax charge will include $108.5
million to write down good will and other intangible assets
of the company's brokerage operations and $18 million to pay
for layoffs and trimming costs. In the year-ago quarter,
Kemper had net income of $121.7 million, or $2.46 a share,
including $67.2 million in profit from discontinued
operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kemper wouldn't forecast this year's second-quarter
results.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Kemper climbed $1.375, to $39; analysts said the rise
reflected investor sentiment that Kemper had moved to address
the problems of its brokerage operations.
   The charge was widely viewed as an overdue effort by the
insurance and financial services company to improve the
performance of its regional brokerage concerns.
   "We could have restructured sooner, but we believe that
this plan is adequate to get the brokers in a stronger
competitive position," said John Fitzpatrick, Kemper's chief
financial officer.
   Kemper acquired most of its regional securities concerns
in the past decade at relatively steep prices. The brokerage
business was itself attractive at the time, and Kemper viewed
the units as sales outlets for its mutual funds and other
financial services.
   "The price was high, but not excessive," Mr. Fitzpatrick
said. "We paid an entry price for regional broker
dealerships, which at the time were disappearing off the face
of the Earth."
   Since then, Kemper has been struggling to reduce the
operations' costs and improve their performance.
   "They went into the business with a strategic plan that
made sense to them, but the entire concept of diversified
financial services has been changing over the last several
years," said Carol Manning, analyst for Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. "Brokerages have less value today."
   The charge comes just two months after David B. Mathis,
former head of Kemper's insurance operations, edged out
Thomas R. Anderson, president and chief executive officer of
the financial unit, for the chief operating job of the parent
company.
   Earlier this month, Kemper was hit with a $38.2 million
arbitration award to a former employee in a contract dispute.
Though it is appealing the award, the company has taken a
second-quarter after-tax charge of $19.5 million to cover the
award, in addition to the $126.5 million for restructuring.
   Kemper said the staff cuts and restructuring will bring
annual after-tax savings of more than $30 million, once the
plan is completed in 1991.
   The company intends to lay off 600 employees at the
regional brokerage operations, a cut of about 12%, and
increase its authorized common stock buy-back program to 2.5
million shares from two million shares.
   The restructuring plan also calls for centralizing risk
management and consolidating back office functions at the
broker firms Kemper owns.
   "These steps should be a positive to those who look at
cash flow, the competitive position of businesses and control
of risk," Mr. Fitzpatrick said.

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said it will assume
responsibility for negotiating U.S. participation in Japan's
plans to pool international know-how in automated
manufacturing.
   The measure effectively halts Tokyo's earlier attempts to
recruit individual U.S. companies and trade associations for
its Intelligent Manufacturing System, or IMS, program, and it
gives the department the right to coordinate any U.S. role.
"Our aim is that everyone's interest be served in a balanced
manner," Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said in a
department statement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The statement said the action is based on an agreement
reached earlier this month in Brussels by the U.S., the
European Community and Japan. At that meeting, the U.S. and
the EC agreed to submit proposals for taking part in the IMS
program, while Japan agreed to refer all private U.S.
inquiries to the Commerce Department.
   A Commerce Department spokesman said yesterday that before
any U.S. company can participate in the IMS program, there
must be an agreement detailing the methods of cooperation,
the ownership of patent rights, the nature of the funding,
and the specific areas of research. The original Japanese
plan was to create an international consortium to design the
automated factories of the future, using the most advanced
computer and artificial-intelligence techniques. Some U.S.
and European officials had charged that the scheme was a
Japanese "Trojan Horse" intended to obtain Western technology
without a reciprocal pooling of knowledge.
   A Japanese Embassy spokesman here declined to say how
Japan will implement the agreement.

   Marketing:
   Downscale Consumers, Long Neglected,
   Start to Get Some Respect From Marketers

   Homer Simpson, the decidedly downscale patriarch of Fox
Broadcasting's "The Simpsons," has become a pop icon. So has
Roseanne Barr, the proletarian star of ABC's hit series
"Roseanne."
   Regular folks are back in fashion, a fact that hasn't
escaped the attention of some of the nation's most powerful
marketers. Blue-collar and other nonprofessional people have
always represented a vast and loyal group of consumers. But
now, with growth in most upscale markets slowing to a crawl,
more companies than ever are viewing them with renewed
respect.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consider: McDonald's Corp. features working stiffs in new
TV commercials. Burger King Corp. plans to use cartoon
characters from "The Simpsons" in promotions. A Southern
cable operator has revamped its marketing to lure low-income
viewers. Clothing maker Gitano Group Inc. cultivates a trendy
image, but focuses its products and prices on middle America.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. advertises some of its top brands in
the National Enquirer.
   Of course, it wouldn't make sense to peddle luxury items
to consumers who can't afford them. But for most of the past
decade, Madison Avenue has been loath to target downscale
markets for even mundane products. In part, that's because
advertisers like to show their products as part of an
affluent life style.
   Some critics also attribute the lack of interest to a
cultural bias on the part of image makers, who often create
marketing campaigns that tend to reflect their own life
styles more than the lives of average consumers. "Nobody
wants to work on a downscale product," says a New York ad
executive. "We're all pretty upscale people, and we all wear
the prestige products we've worked on on our sleeves."
   It's hard to dispute the demographic appeal of Middle
America. The average household earns about $34,000 a year,
according to the most recent Census Bureau figures. That may
not be in a league with gilded yuppiedom, but because of
their numbers, households that live on that figure or less
control more than 30% of total income in the U.S.
   Moreover, middle-class consumers may respond to
down-to-earth pitches in growing numbers because more are
feeling squeezed. Since the early 1970s, family incomes have
hardly managed to stay ahead of inflation. For baby boomers
starting out, that makes upward mobility more difficult.
Allow for climbing health-care costs, property taxes and
tuition bills rising much faster than inflation, and the
ranks of penny pinchers swell.
   "It's the phenomenon of the fading fortunate," says Carol
Colman, a partner in the New York consulting firm Inferential
Focus. "Marketers may have made the mistake of thinking
average Americans made $75,000, and now even that
aspirational group is feeling squeezed."
   The appeal of the blue-collar market goes beyond the
numbers. Despite their image as traitorous coupon clippers,
lower-income consumers may actually be more brand-loyal than
their wealthier counterparts. Because they can less afford to
make mistakes, experts say they're more likely to stick with
a brand that pleases them. "A brand is a safety net for these
groups," says Stewart Owen, director of research at Landor
Associates, a San Francisco image consulting firm.
   Marketers are trying a range of techniques to woo the
diverse downscale market. McDonald's, for example, exalts the
average guy in several new TV commercials created by Leo
Burnett Co. Though the nation's largest purveyor of meals for
the masses has never courted the silk-stocking set, several
ads rolled out in early May more pointedly reflect the modest
life styles of some of its customers.
   In one spot, a nervous suitor launches into a monologue on
his prospective date's doorstep. He's not a doctor or a
lawyer, he proclaims, but a record-store salesperson. The
awkward Romeo is eager to set the record straight on a few
other points: He doesn't wear designer clothes or go to
restaurants that refer to themselves as "bistro." The woman
is enchanted, of course, and happily follows him to the curb
-- where his 1980 Chevrolet Citation awaits.
   In another ad, a little girl waits for her mother to
return from work on a rainy night. When the woman --
apparently a single mom -- finally arrives looking exhausted,
the child reminds her of a promised meal at McDonald's. On
the way to the restaurant, the daughter listens to the
account of her mother's trying day at work. "We're saying
it's OK to be regular," says a McDonald's spokesman.
   Meanwhile, rival Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan
PLC, seems to be sending the message that it's all right to
be a little weird. The fast-food chain plans a series of
promotions starting this summer based on "The Simpsons." A
spokesman for Fox confirms that Burger King has licensed the
characters Homer Simpson, a safety inspector at his town's
nuclear power plant, and his puckish son, Bart, to push
burgers.
   Other marketers are going much further. Birmingham Cable,
which operates cable-TV systems in Birmingham, Ala., and
nearby Bessemer, has repositioned its service to draw
working-class customers. Though the company was doing well
among upscale residents, lower-income people weren't hooking
up in large numbers -- bad news since such customers account
for about two-thirds of the population in the systems'
territories.
   Through a research firm that develops neighborhood
profiles, the cable operator found its territory includes a
cluster of neighborhoods occupied mainly by single adults and
one-parent families who earn an average of $15,000 a year.
Market research also showed that such consumers are put off
by complicated pitches.
   So, Birmingham Cable changed its approach. The company
ditched a glossy brochure, which had included a letter and a
response form, in favor of a brief appeal, and it began to
push the service as cheap family entertainment rather than as
a luxury. Response to the modified mailer more than doubled.
   The cable operator also started advertising its monthly
charges, rather than breaking the cost of the service down to
40 cents a day, a tactic customers found suspicious. "The
people in these market segments are very good money
managers," says Rod Clark, vice president of marketing at
Birmingham Cable. "They're worried about hidden costs."
   For many marketers, targeting the blue-collar brigades is
a matter of finding the right vehicle. Procter &amp; Gamble
places ads in some unexpected publications. For several
years, P&amp;G has been advertising some of its best-known brands
in the noisy pages of the National Enquirer. Tucked near the
tale of a woman who was run over by her own "van from hell"
in a recent issue was this unfanciful claim: "If it's got to
be clean, it's got to be Tide."
   Other marketers court downscale consumers by presenting a
middle-class or affluent image to which they can aspire.
Gitano Group spends some $15 million a year to promote its
women's clothing with slick ads in swanky publications such
as Vogue and Mademoiselle.
   But in fact, Gitano clothing is aimed squarely at the
discount crowd. The primary outlets for the company's wares
-- mostly women's tops and bottoms that sell for around $20
-- are mass merchandisers such as K mart Corp. and Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. And despite Gitano's trendy, youthful ads, most
of the clothes are cut to fit more mature bodies. Some of the
brand's big sellers are maternity clothes and jeans for
larger-sized women.
   General Mills Inc.'s Hamburger Helper brand of dinner
mixes uses a similar marketing illusion to create a
comfortable, middle-class image. The product, whose sales are
booming, was created in the mid-1970s, when meat prices
soared, as a way to stretch ground beef. But ads for the
boxed dinners stress convenience and taste over economy, and
often feature an affluent-looking suburban family.
   Despite the size -- and spending power -- of working-class
America, most marketers don't want their products associated
with the masses. "The marketing community has no aspirations
to address the needs of a demographic group of which it is
not a member," says John Quelch, a professor at Harvard
Business School who specializes in consumer marketing.
Indeed, most brand managers and ad executives have far more
in common with Mr. Quelch's students than with Roseanne or
Homer.

   LOS ANGELES -- The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and
several local companies have committed $39 million toward a
targeted $125 million investment fund for building 4,000
low-income housing units in California.
   The five-year fund raising effort is spearheaded by the
Local Initiatives Support Corp., a nonprofit community
development organization formed by the Ford Foundation in
1979. The organization operates three investment funds --
National Equity Fund, California Equity Fund and New York

   International:
   Gorbachev, in a Significant Gesture,
   Plans to Meet South Korea's Roh in U.S.

   SEOUL, South Korea -- The U.S. arranged a last-minute
meeting between South Korean President Roh Tae Woo and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The meeting would be the most
significant gesture by the Soviets toward South Korea in more
than four decades.
   The meeting will take place in San Francisco Sunday, U.S.
officials confirmed, after Mr. Gorbachev finishes the
official phase of his summit meeting with President Bush in
Washington.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Seoul and Moscow don't have formal diplomatic ties and
Moscow maintains strong links with North Korea. But trade and
other business links between the South Koreans and the
Soviets have been strengthening. Topics would most likely
include South Korea asking Soviet help in diminishing the
antagonism between the South and the Communist North and
Soviet diplomatic recognition of Seoul.
   The U.S. involvement in setting up the meeting indicates
Washington's eagerness to defuse one of the world's last
trouble spots where U.S. troops face a Soviet-supported army.
About 42,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea, many of
them at the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean
peninsula, eye-to-eye with North Korean troops.
   In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said the
U.S. "would welcome a meeting" between the Soviet and South
Korean leaders, but she declined to answer questions about
such a meeting.
   The San Francisco meeting would be the first between a
Soviet leader and a high-level South Korean government
official, let alone a South Korean president. In addition to
seeking diplomatic recognition from the Soviets, Seoul wants
Moscow to let it join the United Nations. North Korea, which
also isn't a U.N. member, doesn't want South Korea to join
and has asked its allies -- China and the U.S.S.R. -- to veto
any admission attempt. Moscow, on the other hand, needs South
Korean trade and investment to help its struggling economy.
   Seoul has tried for many months to convince North Korea's
allies to recognize South Korea and to rein in North Korea,
whose excesses in past years have included bombing and
killing South Korean leaders in Rangoon and Burma, and
blowing up a Korean Air Lines commercial jet on the eve of
the 1988 Summer Olympics. Even before communism began
faltering in Eastern Europe last year, South Korea made
progress with many of those nations and was isolating North
Korea. Seoul established diplomatic ties with Poland, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia; in December, it and Moscow began limited
consular services in their trade offices in each other's
capitals.
   But Moscow, North Korea's main supporter, has held back on
full diplomatic ties. The Soviets very much want South
Korea's trade and economic assistance. China, which has
become more hard-line following the Tiananmen massacre last
summer, also shows little eagerness to openly support South
Korea over North Korea, though its trade relations with South
Korea have been growing rapidly, too.
   North Korea has always successfully played China off
against the Soviets and it has never been clear how much real
influence Moscow and Beijing have on North Korean leader Kim
Il Sung. North Korea has shown no sign of retreating from its
rigid Stalinist policies.
   The Gorbachev-Roh meeting could provide a major boost for
Mr. Roh, whose popularity is slipping as South Koreans blame
him for their economy's fits and starts. The Korean stock
market reversed its plummet Wednesday when rumors about the
trip circulated. It closed at 789.89, up 6.02 points.
   The trip will also undoubtedly feed criticism of Mr. Roh
and the U.S. by Korea's radicals, who are likely to contend
that the U.S. hand in setting up the Roh-Gorbachev meeting
proves their allegation that Mr. Roh is a puppet of the U.S.
   Mr. Roh originally planned to be in the U.S. during the
Gorbachev visit, but canceled his trip to Mexico, Canada and
the U.S. because he didn't want to risk being criticized for
leaving Korea when the country faced economic troubles.

   EC Study Finds
   Fraud, Waste
   In Farm Policy

   Court of Auditors Criticizes
   EC Commission, States
   For Roles in Program

   BRUSSELS -- In a devastating condemnation of the European
Community's agricultural policy, the EC's Court of Auditors
found widespread criminal fraud, mismanagement and waste in
its $33 billion-a-year farm-subsidy program.
   The court criticized the EC member states and the EC
Commission for their roles in managing farm policy. The court
said member states provided too few safeguards against
financial abuse and that the commission had failed to satisfy
"the requirements of public accountability."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   John Carey, one of the court's 12 members, said he
couldn't estimate how much money the EC was losing to fraud
and mismanagement. Previous estimates from other sources have
ranged between $3 billion and $10 billion a year. But Mr.
Carey said court investigators had uncovered a series of
multimillion-dollar cases in the past two years including
rigged tendering of contracts, subsidies paid on
misidentified or nonexistent products and other abuses. He
also said the EC's policy was too complex and difficult to
administer.
   Guy Legras, the commission's top civil servant in charge
of agriculture, defended the EC's farm policy and the
commission's management of it. He said many of the cases the
court uncovered were blown out of proportion. But the
criticism of the EC farm policy comes at an awkward time for
the commission; it is trying to defend its agriculture policy
in world trade talks and at the same time convince member
states to give more powers to EC institutions.
   This isn't the first time the court has faulted EC farm
policy, but the strong language of the report is likely to
get more attention than previous investigations. A U.S. trade
official said she hoped the Court of Auditors report "would
finally wake EC consumers up to the fact that they are paying
through the nose" for a program that is supposed to be
helping farmers but instead is lining the pockets of big
traders, shippers and other middlemen.
   The court's findings also could make it more difficult for
the EC to defend its agricultural subsidies program in the
current Uruguay Round of world trade talks. In those talks,
the EC's export-restitution program is blamed by most other
countries for raising retail food prices and creating unfair
competition. Experts say the policy is unfair to producers
from less-developed countries who are often squeezed out of
the market by the subsidized European products.
   The independent Court of Auditors is charged with
overseeing financial management of the EC budget, about 54%
of which is composed of the agricultural subsidy program. The
latest investigation covered only beef, dairy and grain
exports. The total export subsidies program costs EC
taxpayers more than $11.5 billion a year.

   NEW YORK -- Investors pushed stock and bond prices higher
for the second day, and this time the volume in stocks was
heavy enough to suggest a broadening interest in the market.
   New records were set by the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
which rose 8.07 points to 2878.56, and by Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index, which inched ahead 0.21 to 360.86. Volume on
the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 199.5 million shares
from Tuesday's thin 137.4 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose a quarter of a
point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount, in modest
trading. The dollar rose narrowly against the Japanese yen
and sharply against the West German mark.
   Many investors said they continue to be mystified by the
stock market's persistent strength in the face of economic
data indicating a weaker economy. However, the same data have
helped push bond prices higher and interest rates lower,
which lessens the appeal of bonds to investors.
   "But there's a flaw in this logic," said Abby Cohen,
market strategist at Barclays. "If bond interest rates are
falling because of a sluggish economy, then investors should
ask whether profit expectations also will be falling soon. My
concern is we have had investors interpreting bad news for
the economy as good news for the stock market. It's a trading
mentality" produced by "many years of a bull market."
   Ms. Cohen attributed much of the heavy volume to program
trading and "tactical asset allocation" -- shifts of money
from bonds into stocks largely because of interest-rate
moves. But individual and institutional investors also are
contributing to the volume, said Carmine Grigoli, vice
president of equity research at First Boston.
   "The market keeps reaching new highs and attracting
interest among individuals and institutions," Mr. Grigoli
said. "Now we're crossing the point where stocks are
outperforming cash this year. Until now, cash has been king."
   Counteracting the upward pressure from such investors
eager to get into a rising market were others wanting to take
profits, said Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst at
Kidder Peabody. "There was a good tug-of-war going on," he
said, noting that the Dow industrial was up as much as 25
points earlier in the day.
   Bond prices rose on the expectation that the report on the
May unemployment rate, due out tomorrow, will be unchanged.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose. In heavy Big Board trading, gainers led
losers, 803 to 691.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year
bond fell to 8.59%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar gained. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6830 marks and 151.45 yen, compared with
1.6740 marks and 151.25 yen Tuesday.

Centel Corp. noted that it had said in 1988 that it planned
to sell its Business Systems Group, which included Centel
Communications Systems, Centel Federal Systems and Centel
Information Systems.
   Centel Corp. sold its Federal Systems unit, which sells
data systems to federal agencies, to a management group
earlier this year. Yesterday, the company said it is "still
seeking bids" for the Information Systems unit, which makes
data-communications products for private industry customers.

   Boesky Ex-Aide Testifies He Conducted
   Illegal Trades With John Mulheren

   NEW YORK -- A key aide to convicted former stock
speculator Ivan F. Boesky said that he conducted numerous
illegal securities trades with defendant John A. Mulheren Jr.
and that Mr. Mulheren proposed a bogus scheme to compensate
Mr. Boesky for profits on those trades.
   Michael Davidoff's testimony provided the most damaging
evidence yet in the government's case against Mr. Mulheren,
former chief of Jamie Securities Co. Mr. Davidoff appeared to
help the government much more than did his former boss, Mr.
Boesky, who testified last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,
securities fraud and keeping false records in connection with
his dealings with Mr. Boesky.
   Appearing nervous and speaking with a slight stammer, Mr.
Davidoff recalled a series of trades with Mr. Mulheren that
Mr. Davidoff said were designed to generate tax losses for
Mr. Boesky's trading company and to help evade net capital
requirements.
   Mr. Davidoff, 46 years old, said the trades with Mr.
Mulheren, which Mr. Davidoff said he believed to be illegal
at the time he did them, began in July 1985 and continued
until March of the following year. Mr. Davidoff said he
conducted the trades at Mr. Boesky's direction. Mr. Davidoff,
once Mr. Boesky's chief trader, pleaded guilty in 1987 to one
felony count related to securities fraud and is awaiting
sentencing.
   In every case, Mr. Davidoff said, Mr. Boesky's company
agreed to sell securities to Mr. Mulheren's firm with the
understanding that those securities would later be
repurchased. Mr. Davidoff said he repeatedly assured Mr.
Mulheren that all profits and losses from the trades "would
be borne by" Mr. Boesky's company.
   Mr. Davidoff said the first of these trades with Mr.
Mulheren involved stock of Unocal Corp. and was arranged by
Mr. Boesky himself. Mr. Davidoff said he did the trade with
Mr. Boesky after talking with him. Shown records of the trade
by assistant U.S. attorney Alfred Pavlis, Mr. Davidoff
acknowledged it was his handwriting on the documents.
   Mr. Davidoff said that Mr. Mulheren later agreed to buy
securities in five other companies with the understanding
Jamie Securities would sell these securities back to Mr.
Boesky at a later date and be compensated for any losses. By
December 1985, Mr. Davidoff said, Jamie Securities owed Mr.
Boesky's firm "over $1 million" from profits that Jamie made
on the trades.
   According to Mr. Davidoff's testimony, Mr. Mulheren
proposed a scheme where Jamie would inflate brokerage bills
it paid to Mr. Boesky's trading company in late 1985. But in
March 1986, when Mr. Boesky wanted to speed up the payments,
Mr. Davidoff said that he agreed with Mr. Mulheren that Jamie
would sell Mr. Boesky securities at below-market prices,
resulting in a profit to Mr. Boesky.
   Mr. Davidoff is expected to continue his testimony today
and will likely be cross-examined by Thomas Puccio, an
attorney for Mr. Mulheren.

   American International Seeks to Acquire
   Fischbach Through $44 Million Merger

   American International Group Inc., in an apparent move to
protect itself from potentially large performance-bond
claims, said it is proposing through a subsidiary to acquire
Fischbach Corp. in a merger at $11 a share, or approximately
$44 million.
   American International, a large New York-based insurer, is
responsible for a large portion of the performance bonds for
Fischbach, a troubled electrical and mechanical contracting
concern based in New York. While an American International
spokesman said he couldn't estimate the dollar amount of the
performance bonds issued to Fischbach, the total reportedly
is about $600 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Performance or surety bonds usually guarantee that
construction projects for municipalities and other entities
are completed as promised.
   American International officials weren't available late
yesterday to explain the status of the work guaranteed by
these bonds and how recent these commitments were.
   American International also said it plans to bring in a
construction company to provide management consulting
services to loss-ridden Fischbach as soon as American
International can obtain approval from Fischbach's board.
   In addition, APL Corp., controlled by Miami financier
Victor Posner, said it and American International modified
the terms of American International's previously announced
option to acquire APL's approximately 54% stake in Fischbach
to set a new exercise price of $11 a share.
   APL also said it agreed to recommend approval of the
merger proposal to Fischbach's board, which APL said is
planning to meet next week to consider the matter.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Fischbach closed at $9.75, unchanged. Fischbach officials
couldn't be reached for comment.
   American International said the proposed merger would be
subject to approval of Fischbach's board and other customary
conditions.
   Mr. Posner couldn't be reached for comment, but he may rue
the day he became involved with Fischbach. He paid far more
for the shares than the $11-a-share option he gave to
American International. And the manner in which he acquired
control has proven to be part of one of Wall Street's most
high-profile scandals.
   According to testimony by Michael Milken, the former
junk-bond king who pleaded guilty last month to six felonies,
one of his misdeeds was forcing an unwilling Fischbach into
the hands of Mr. Posner by having Ivan Boesky take a large
and unlawfully secret position in the company's stock.
   Analysts were puzzled by American International's
announcement yesterday. One said that if a contractor can't
complete a job, insurers would typically pay the claims, but
not take over the entire contracting company.
   Another person familiar with Fischbach believes American
International's move is "purely defensive," as the insurer
would probably like to oversee the management of Fischbach as
a way of guarding against possible future claims against its
performance bonds.
   In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last
December, Maurice Greenberg, chairman of American
International, said the company has been an insurer of
"Posner enterprises for a number of years and with
satisfactory results."
   Mr. Greenberg also said last December that American
International could hold on to Fischbach as an investment or
act "as a facilitator," possibly selling it to another entity
that would be interested in the contracting business.

   Smith Barney Is Sued

   Over Sale of Shares

   LOS ANGELES -- A former employee has sued Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. for allegedly forcing employees to resell
stock to the securities firm just before a merger with
Primerica Inc. in 1987.
   According to a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior
Court by John L. Heath, a former first vice president in
Smith Barney's San Francisco office, the firm falsely claimed
it had the right to force repurchase of shares owned by
employees in Sbhu Holdings Inc. The suit, which seeks
class-action status, is requesting unspecified damages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Heath said he bought blocks of stock annually in the
holding company, under a company stock-purchase plan,
accumulating shares with a book value of more than $300,000
between 1979 and 1985.
   In his complaint, the executive said he left the company
in 1985 and was subsequently told three times by Smith Barney
that he must sell portions of the shares back at book value.
The last repurchase of about $200,000 of shares came just two
months before the Primerica acquisition, Mr. Heath alleges in
his suit.
   It was common practice among Wall Street brokerage
partnerships to require partners who resigned to gradually
sell back their stock in the partnerships. Smith Barney was a
partnership before being acquired by Primerica, and had such
a stock buy-back plan.
   The complaint says that Smith Barney breached its
fiduciary duty to employees because it didn't disclose the
pending acquisition by Primerica in which shares were
acquired at more than double book value.
   Richard Callahan Jr., Mr. Heath's attorney, said, "The
company had the right to buy back the stock under certain
terms of the employee agreements, but those terms weren't
met. It's our position, and we intend to prove, that there
must have been awareness that at least negotiations {to merge
with Primerica} were going on, and employees should have been
given knowledge of that." A Primerica official said the
company and its Smith Barney unit hadn't seen the complaint,
and couldn't comment.

   Banks' Insurance
   Bill in Delaware
   Is Signed Into Law

   Delaware's governor yesterday signed into law a measure
that allows banks chartered in the state to underwrite and
sell insurance nationwide to consumers.
   A few other states allow a limited number of banks to
underwrite insurance, but Delaware is the first to put such
broad legislation on its books. The new law opens the door to
major and superregional banks, several of which already had
financial services operations in the state. It also could
make Delaware a springboard for national insurance-marketing
efforts by banks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About a dozen banks with operations in Delaware could
benefit from the new law, and some are moving quickly to take
advantage of it. Shortly after Gov. Michael Castle signed the
banking bill yesterday afternoon, New York-based Chase
Manhattan Corp. announced plans to transfer its Delaware
subsidiary, Chase Manhattan Bank (USA), from a federal to a
state charter.
   Chase said its Delaware unit plans to underwrite and sell
homeowners and auto insurance, possibly in partnership with
other insurance carriers, using direct mail, telemarketing
and advertising.
   A spokesman for Citicorp said the New York-based bank
plans to establish a headquarters in Kent County for
underwriting and agency purposes. This office will eventually
employ approximately 300 to 500 people.
   The Delaware banking law allows banks chartered in the
state after 1933 to engage in all aspects of the insurance
business through separate divisions or subsidiaries. Assets,
liabilities and records of the insurance units are to be kept
separate from those of the bank. A bank can't invest more
than 25% of its total capital, surplus and undivided profits
in its insurance operations.
   Banks pushed aggressively to get this banking bill through
the Delaware Legislature. They see insurance as a
multibillion-dollar business that they want to enter on a
large scale. The Castle administration and some state
officials backed the measure, because it holds the promise of
generating thousands of new jobs that could prolong the
state's economic boom.
   The powerful insurance lobby waged a bitter battle in the
past two years to try to defeat the bill. Insurance agents
claimed that the banks would bring unfair competition to the
market. Insurance company officials fear that the solvency
safeguards in the new law might not withstand a crisis and
capital shortage.
   A group of five insurance trade associations requested the
Federal Reserve to block the Delaware law. The insurers are
asking the Fed to rule that federal bank holding company
regulation prohibits the nationwide sale of insurance by a
bank's nonbanking subsidiary.
   Gov. Castle also signed into law a companion bill that
offers some protection to insurance agents in Delaware. This
law limits banks' marketing of insurance to Delaware
residents. The companion bill was designed by state senators
to win the votes needed to get the banking bill through the
Delaware Senate.

   MONEY IS THE LEGAL TENDER of philanthropy, but it can take
forms other than cash. Sir Thomas Lipton, for example, the
Scottish-born master marketer and yachtsman who made
tea-drinking big business in the U.S., willed $4 million to
the poor of his native Glasgow. His successors at the Thomas
J. Lipton Co. (now a Unilever subsidiary) who, unlike Sir
Thomas, must explain their largesse to stockholders, are
celebrating their U.S. centennial by giving time and
expertise to a whole spectrum of causes.
   When Blaine Hess, Lipton's president, called for
"something special" to add to the conventional 100-year
hoopla, his staff gave him the idea of using the company's
considerable marketing and promotion muscle to urge consumers
to volunteer for worthy causes.
   The timing was right on the money. Volunteers can be as
vital as cash, and their numbers have been shrinking. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics found this year that one in five
Americans was giving time to charity; in 1974, it was one in
four. From 1981 to 1988, according to Independent Sector, a
Washington, D.C., umbrella group for nonprofit organizations,
the percentage of adults doing volunteer work dropped to 45%
from 52%. Among women, traditionally the mainstay of charity
drives, the falloff was from 56% to 47%.
   With a cash outlay of $500,000, Lipton will stage half a
dozen fairs at shopping malls across the country, the first
in Chicago, the others in New Orleans, Kansas City,
Philadelphia, Dallas and Tampa. At these "mall events," local
agencies serving  everything from AIDS to the Little League
will be invited to make their pitches for volunteers among
the crowds Lipton expects to generate.
   To round up the agencies, Lipton teamed with an
organization that has been recruiting volunteers for 11
years. This  is the Volunteer National Center, a Washington,
D.C.-based nonprofit group headed by former auto executive
George Romney. The Center selected the six cities for the
volunteer fairs and will handle the job of inviting the local
charities. Lipton takes it from there.
   As a food company, malls are Lipton's home ground,
explains Anthony Montuori, vice president for marketing
support. To keep the crowds coming, shopping centers are
hungry for any event that will draw them. Four malls in
Kansas City, Mr. Montuori says, began competing for Lipton's
volunteer fair as soon as they heard of it.
   Lipton's staff warmed up with a minifair at its New Jersey
headquarters, rounding up 30 local philanthropic agencies to
make their pitches to Lipton employees and those of neighbors
like Lever Brothers (a sister Unilever subsidiary), publisher
Prentice-Hall and other companies based along the Jersey
Palisades. Five hundred potential volunteers showed up.
   Before the first volunteer fair opened at Chicago's North
Pier Mall, Lipton flew six regional directors of the
Volunteer National Center to New Jersey for a two-day,
all-expenses-paid seminar on public relations and media
techniques. The six, in turn, were expected to conduct their
own PR drills in each of the mall cities. To back up these
amateur drumbeaters, Lipton will fly its own promotion people
to each site to round up local media coverage, help conduct
interviews and oversee the fanfare.

   Delaying Marriage,
   Time and Again

   BRIDES AND GROOMS are getting older. People are waiting
longer to get married the first time, and they're also
waiting longer to remarry.
   In 1977, the median age of all brides was 23. First-time
brides were 21, on average, and women who remarried were 31.
In 1987, the median age of all brides was 26. First-time
brides were nearly 24 and remarrying brides were 34,
according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
   For grooms, the overall median age for newlywed men rose
to 28 from 25. In 1977, first-time husbands were 23 and men
who remarried were 35. In 1987, men getting married the first
time had a median age of 25 and those getting remarried were
38.
   Women now bide their time more than ever when getting
married for the second, third or fourth time. In 1977, women
who remarried did so within an average of three years of
getting divorced or being widowed; for men, the interval was
2 1/2 years. In 1987, women who remarried had waited four
years and men had waited 3 1/2 years. Widows wait almost
twice as long to remarry as divorced women. But widowers
don't wait much longer to remarry than divorced men.
                                                                                                       

   One in Five Americans
   Volunteers Some Time
                                                                                                       

   ALMOST 40 million Americans take the time to care.
   One out of five people 16 years or older volunteers some
of his or her time, based on a 1989 Bureau of Labor
Statistics survey. That appears to be off since a 1974
survey, which isn't strictly comparable, that found one in
four volunteering time to charity.
   The median amount of time people now donate is a little
more than four hours a week. The average volunteer works half
the weeks of the year.
   Women are slightly more likely than men to volunteer; 22%
of women donate time vs. 19% of men. People aged 35 to 44 are
most likely to volunteer, 29% of them do so. Only 11% of
those in their early 20s volunteer. Married people are more
likely to volunteer than others; one out of four does so vs.
14% of never-marrieds and 17% of divorced people.
   Better-educated and working people are more likely to
volunteer than others. Nearly 40% of those with four or more
years of college volunteer time, compared with 8% of high
school dropouts. And 26% of people who work part-time and 22%
of full-time workers spend time volunteering, compared with
17% of those who don't work in the paid labor force.
   Religious organizations are the most popular places to
spend volunteer time, followed by educational institutions
and civic or political groups. The elderly are more likely to
spend time with hospitals and social welfare groups than with
schools. Men are more than twice as likely as women to spend
time with sports and recreational groups and half as likely
to volunteer at schools.
   Only 9% of Hispanics volunteer, compared with 12% of
blacks and 22% of whites. But when they do volunteer,
Hispanics average 5.2 hours a week vs. 4.8 hours for blacks
and 4.3 hours for whites. Blacks and Hispanics most often
volunteer time to a church or other religious group.
                                                                                                       

   Female Graduates Close
   Part of Income Gap
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN GET MORE out of a college education than they used
to. But for men, a college degree is just a way to keep their
heads above water.
   A new Census Bureau report on income trends shows that men
aged 25 or older with four or more years of college had
$35,700 in median cash income from all sources in 1988. This
is up from the $35,300 they had in 1968, in
inflation-adjusted dollars. But for college-educated women in
this age group, income rose much faster, to $20,500 from
$16,600.
   Even with the gain, the median income of college-educated
women remains far below that of men. Women as a group still
are less likely to work than men, and those who do more often
have part-time jobs or work in lower-paying clerical or
service jobs.
   Men with less than four years of college lost economic
ground in the past 20 years. Median income for high school
graduates who didn't go on to college fell to $21,200 in 1988
from $24,300 in 1968. Even for men with one to three years of
college, income fell slightly, to $25,400 from $27,000.
   Women in all education groups had income gains. For high
school graduates, median income rose to $9,700 in 1988 from
$9,600 in 1968. For those with one to three years of college
education, median income rose fastest of all, to $13,400 from
$10,200.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   OVER FOUR million babies were born in the U.S. last year,
the most recorded since the baby boom ended in 1964. The
National Center for Health Statistics reports that one-third
of the 3% rise over 1988 levels is because of a 1% increase
in the number of women 15 to 44 years old, but the rest is
due to a 2% rise in fertility rates. In other words, women
are having more children. . . . Virtually all full-time
employees in medium and large firms get paid to go on
vacation and take holidays off, states a 1989 Bureau of Labor
Statistics survey. Nine out of 10 workers get paid for going
on jury duty, 68% for being sick and 10% for hours spent
eating lunch. But only 3% of women and 1% of men get paid to
take care of a new baby (another 37% of women and 18% of men
are eligible for unpaid parental leaves). . . . The U.S.
suicide rate is relatively low -- 15th among 25 developed
countries studied by Metropolitan Life. Suicide rates are
lower in the U.K., Ireland and several Mediterranean
countries; they are higher in Canada, Japan, Scandinavia and
most of the rest of Europe.

fiscal second quarter, ending today, up from 33 cents a share
in the year-ago period.
   However, the frozen-yogurt retailer, whose stock has been
something of a highflier on Wall Street, said it expects
sales at stores open more than a year will be down for the
quarter because of poor weather during April and May.

   Belzbergs Sell Entire Stake in Armstrong
   At a Loss, Ending Battle for Active Role

   Canada's Belzberg family sold its entire 11.7% stake in
Armstrong World Industries Inc. at a loss yesterday, bailing
out of a yearlong losing battle to effect a takeover or
otherwise influence the course of the company.
   Belzberg-controlled First City Financial Corp. sold its
4.8 million shares in one block for $35.75 a share, or a
total of about $171.5 million. The late-afternoon trade
occurred at about $1.625 below the prevailing market price
and left First City with an estimated loss of $16 million to
$18 million on its investment. The Belzbergs' personal loss
was significantly smaller.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Armstrong's shares closed at $35.75, down $1.50.
   "We didn't do all the things we wanted to do with
Armstrong. But we've certainly focused the world's attention
on it," said W. Gordon Lancaster, First City Financial's
executive vice president, and a longtime associate of family
patriarch Samuel Belzberg. Mr. Belzberg recently described
the Armstrong stake as a "long-term" holding, though he
didn't rule out a possible sale of the shares.
   First City Capital Corp., the Belzbergs' New York-based
merchant bank, issued a cryptic, one-page statement, in which
it said, "It is now clear to us that we cannot play an active
role in enhancing value for Armstrong shareholders.
Accordingly, we have decided to sell our Armstrong shares and
look for investment opportunities elsewhere."
   Armstrong, a Lancaster, Pa., maker of flooring and other
building products, said the repurchase was in the best
interests of shareholders. "We can get down to the business
of building up the results of the business," a company
spokesman said.
   Armstrong is believed to have purchased 1.6 million of the
Belzberg shares as part of its continuing stock repurchase
program. The spokesman would not comment on the number of
shares purchased beyond saying it was "significant."
   The remaining shares were apparently purchased by
institutional investors through Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., which
handled the buy side of the trade, said one market source.
Goldman Sachs is Armstrong's investment banker.
   Industry analysts said they were not surprised that the
Belzbergs sold their stake, particularly in light of recent
setbacks in their drive to buy Armstrong or find another
bidder for it.
   Last month, Pennsylvania passed a strict anti-takeover law
at Armstrong's behest. A few days later, the family lost a
bitter proxy fight at Armstrong's annual meeting, managing to
seat only one of four directors on the company's 13-member
board.
   "The market has been discounting the Belzbergs' presence
for some time," said John Baugh of Wheat First Securities.
"The Belzbergs had few options: holding the stock for
investment purposes or selling it."
   Jonathan Goldfarb of Merrill Lynch Research said the
Belzbergs' ownership of Armstrong stock was probably a damper
on the company's stock price. "Their big block was hanging
over the market," Mr. Goldfarb said. "Everyone was thinking,
`How are they going to get rid of it?'"
   The Belzbergs first disclosed their interest in Armstrong
last July 3, when they announced a 9.85% stake in the
company, in a filing with securities regulators.
   The Belzbergs' sudden exit from Armstrong follows a spate
of bad news at First City Financial, whose earnings tumbled
in the first quarter, and whose stock is languishing near its
52-week low of C$7.25. In Toronto Stock Exchange trading
yesterday, its shares closed at C$7.50, unchanged.
   Family patriarch Samuel Belzberg said earlier this month
that losses on arbitrage trading largely accounted for the
big drop in first-quarter earnings of First City Financial,
the family's flagship investment and holding company.
   As reported, First City's profit totaled C$5.2 million, or
10 Canadian cents a share, for the period, down from
prior-year net, before special items, of C$31.7 million, or
58 cents a share. The sale of an investment swelled last
year's first-quarter net to C$155.4 million, or C$2.82 a
share.
   Much of First City Financial's earnings in recent years
came from what critics say is classic greenmail -- acquiring
a big stake in a company, threatening a takeover, then
selling out at a profit, often to the target itself. With the
takeover boom waning, partly because of the end of easy
junk-bond financing, some investors are wondering where First
City Financial will go from here.
   The sale of the Armstrong stake at a loss and Mr.
Belzberg's recent hints that First City is exiting arbitrage
suggest that that the Belzbergs may be considering a shift in
the company's focus.
   Mr. Belzberg has provided few clues, though he said
recently he sees major opportunities arising in real estate,
particularly on the West Coast, where the family has major
interests.

   Joseph J. Pinola today ends his ill-starred 12-year tenure
as chairman and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based
First Interstate Bancorp, the nation's eighth-largest bank.
   Mr. Pinola yields his posts to Edward M. Carson, 60 years
old, who moves from president to chief executive and chairman
as of today. William Siart, 43, who has been running First
Interstate's profitable California unit, becomes president of
the parent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This is a bitter moment for the proud, headstrong Mr.
Pinola. Analysts and industry executives give him credit for
assembling a far-flung and potentially lucrative retail
franchise in the western U.S. But Mr. Pinola wasn't able to
capitalize on that network.
   He had visions of First Interstate dominating banking in
the West, yet at the end of his reign, he finds his
reputation as banker is tainted and his beloved company
staggered by disastrous decisions he and his subordinates
made, most notably an acquisition in Texas that has cost
First Interstate about $500 million since 1987.
   Mr. Carson has effectively been running the company since
Mr. Pinola announced his retirement in January. He has said
that he intends to rebuild the company from within,
concentrating on streamlining First Interstate's bloated cost
structure, one of the worst in banking.

   ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc., Irving, Texas, said its board
approved a change in its 1.3 million warrants outstanding,
allowing holders to exercise them between Aug. 15, 1990, and
May 2, 1993. Previously, the pizza restaurant chain said,
holders could exercise the warrants only in the 90 days
preceding May 2, 1993.
   The warrants, which are exercisable at $4 a share, were
issued when ShowBiz was spun off from Integra-A Hotel &amp;
Restaurant Co. at the end of 1988. ShowBiz has about 6.1
million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hallwood Group Inc., a New York merchant bank, and its
affiliates own about 1.2 million of the warrants. Hallwood
previously agreed to exercise 800,000 of the warrants in June
for $3.2 million, increasing its stake in ShowBiz to more
than 20% from about 8%. ShowBiz said it plans to use proceeds
from the transaction to reduce its debt and to expand.

   DISARMING FRANCE'S POLICEMEN

   French policemen are facing the prospect of hanging up
their guns.
   Most don't need the weapons, Interior Minister Joxe
suggested during talks about proposed legislation affecting
10,000 municipal policemen. He supported his argument with
the example of London, where only 2,552 of the 26,800 police
officers are armed.
   Roger Chaix, former director of the national intelligence
service, rejected Mr. Joxe's comparison with London, saying
that "crime doesn't have the same characteristics in Britain
as in France, where unfortunately there is extremely violent
crime." According to Mr. Chaix, "the London bobby is
respected," unlike the "police of Paris, Lyon or Marseille."
   Police unions estimate that 95% of France's 80,000 armed
uniformed officers would oppose mothballing their guns.
                                                                                                       

   EC AID FOR YUGOSLAVIA
                                                                                                       

   Abel Matutes, the European Community's commissioner for
Mediterranean countries, said the 12-nation trading bloc
would be increasing loan aid to Yugoslavia and would upgrade
the current cooperation agreement between Belgrade and the EC
into an association agreement. Mr. Matutes said the next
five-year loan for Yugoslavia, from July 1, 1991, would be
900 million European currency units ($1.1 billion), almost
double the current five-year loan of 550 million ECUs.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S FEARFUL ILLEGAL WORKERS

   Thousands of illegal foreign workers in Japan have been
streaming to immigration offices to be deported after false
rumors they would be arrested under a new law that goes into
effect tomorrow. Most of the illegal workers are Pakistanis,
Malaysians and Bangladeshis. Under the new law, employers or
brokers of illegal aliens -- not the employees themselves --
face up to three years in jail.
                                                                                                       

   BANNING BRITISH BEEF
                                                                                                       

   France banned all imports of British beef to protect
against an outbreak of "mad cow" disease that has killed
thousands of British cattle. Agriculture Minister Henri
Nallet said the ban would be lifted as soon as Paris was
convinced that the British virus posed no danger to French
citizens. Austria imposed a similar ban Tuesday. The British
government says there is no evidence that the virus can
affect humans.
                                                                                                       

   GERMAN INFLATION: A PROMISE
                                                                                                       

   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said
inflation will be kept under a ceiling of 3% after the two
Germanys form an economic and monetary union. Addressing a
meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris, Mr.
Haussmann said the Deutsche Bundesbank will act to keep
inflation from exceeding that 3% ceiling. "It is clearly
defined in the state treaty {on economic and monetary union}
that money supply for the two German states will be decided
only by the Deutsche Bundesbank," he stressed. He said West
Germany's current inflation rate is 2.7%.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPEAN DRUG CONTROLS
                                                                                                       

   The European Community's executive commission said it
planned to introduce stringent controls on trade in chemicals
used to turn plants into addictive narcotics. The 12
chemicals, mostly solvents and acids, are used to turn coca
leaves, poppies and other plants into drugs like heroin or
cocaine and are used to make synthetic drugs such as LSD. But
the chemicals are also widely used to make paint, varnish and
glue, and the commission said its proposal tried to
"reconcile the need to efficiently monitor trade in these
chemicals with the legitimate interests of legal trade."
                                                                                                       

   SPANISH NUCLEAR SHUTDOWN
                                                                                                       

   The Vandellos I nuclear-power plant in northeastern Spain
was closed permanently yesterday, throwing into doubt the
future of Spain's nuclear-energy program.
   Energy Minister Claudio Aranzadi told parliament that
repair and modernization of the plant is too great an
economic burden to "justify to the consumer." He said the
cost of restarting the power station, which was shut down
last October after a fire, would run upwards of 33 billion
pesetas ($315 million).
   While Spain's Nuclear Safety Commission determined that no
radiation leaked from the plant during the fire, the accident
sparked a storm of protest. Questions about the plant's
safety prompted the government to shut down the power
station, though few had expected the closure would be
permanent.
   "Permanently closing Vandellos clearly sends a signal that
the anti-nuclear position is gaining ground in the
government," said Jose Porta, an analyst with BSN S.A. in
Madrid. He noted that the decision implies that
Valdecaballeros nuclear-power plant in central Spain, which
is now 70% complete, isn't likely ever to see a startup.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Japanese wine lovers, usually among the first in the world
each November to sample France's Beaujolais Nouveau, will be
among the last this year. The charter flights that carry the
wine to Japan will be delayed by foreign dignitaries arriving
in Tokyo for Emperor Akihito's enthronement. . . . In South
Africa, hijackers seized a truck delivering the latest
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" tapes from Johannesburg's Jan
Smuts airport to a local television station. The station said
it would screen repeats until replacements are rushed from
New York.

   What Nerve, to Say, `We Must
   Have Lunch,' and Really Mean It

   Genevieve McLaughlin plans to retire tomorrow from
Independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia, but her employer
won't let her go without a luncheon.
   Ms. McLaughlin, a Blue Cross employee since 1971, doesn't
want one of the company's traditional farewell fetes. She
says she'd rather steer the $1,200 that would be spent on it
to a worthy cause.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I grew up in poverty and worked to put my four children
through school," says Ms. McLaughlin, a 64-year-old claims
examiner. Her retirement, she says, means a "chance to help
someone else with a substantial amount of money."
   But Independence Blue Cross, skittish at being caught
without a policy guideline on the issue, insists on going
ahead with a luncheon at a local hotel. These affairs,
attended by up to 35 colleagues and a handful of managers,
include flowers, photos and a $100 gift certificate for the
retiree.
   Three years ago, when Ms. McLaughlin first broached the
idea of a donation, it was greeted with a smile and quietly
swept under the rug, she says. Unyielding, she told Blue
Cross two months ago that she has no intention of attending
the company luncheon when she retires.
   Independence Blue Cross, which has two million subscribers
in southeastern Pennsylvania, then formed a six-member
advisory group to ponder the propriety of her charitable
urges. A Blue Cross spokeswoman says the group has drafted a
recommendation, which remains secret. The panel is awaiting
comments from the company's senior management council, after
which it will draw up a final plan. The spokeswoman predicts
any change will be adopted in less than a year.
   In the meantime, company officials have urged Ms.
McLaughlin to settle for the luncheon and let the policy
group's decision benefit those who retire after her, if
that's how they decide.
   But Ms. McLaughlin says her closest friends and office
mates have already thrown a little party for her; anything
more, she figures, would be a waste. And she questions the
value of having a luncheon with drinking and canned speeches
by people who have passed her in the hallway for years
without saying a word.
   Ms. McLaughlin is convinced that others share her
conviction. "I know of two people in particular who want
their {retirement luncheon} money to go to hospices," she
says. If she has her druthers, she says, she'll split the
$1,200 between a local hospice and a little league.

   Private Placement
   Of Swedish Issue
   Set via New Rule

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)

<LP>
   Another first takes place tomorrow in the long-awaited
transformation of the U.S. market for privately placed
securities.
   An international stock offering for Atlas Copco AB, a
Swedish industrial and construction equipment company, closes
tomorrow. Investment bankers say it is the first stock
offering under the Securities and Exchange Commission's new
Rule 144a, which is designed to ease trading of privately
placed securities in the U.S. by exempting billions of
dollars in new offerings from U.S. disclosure rules.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last month the SEC passed the new 144a rule, which is
expected to benefit big institutional investors but not small
investors. The new rule allows certain large U.S.
institutions to sell and trade private-placement securities
without having to fill out extensive financial disclosure
forms. The new rule is meant to draw foreign companies and
sovereigns to the U.S. markets to raise capital.
   Bankers said Atlas Copco last week placed a 1.3 billion
Swedish kronor ($214 million) offering that was
oversubscribed, with 23% of the offering -- or about $50
million of common stock -- placed in the U.S. under the new
Rule 144a. Lead manager of the issue was Enskilda Securities,
a London-based unit of Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken. CS First Boston Inc.'s First Boston Corp. unit headed
a regional syndicate for North America.
   The Atlas Copco offering is the first stock deal under
Rule 144a, investment bankers said, but it isn't the first
overall. A $100 million bond offering under Rule 144a for
British Aerospace closed May 14; investment bankers led by
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. completed that transaction.
   Elsewhere on the 144a front, Salomon Inc.'s Salomon
Brothers Inc. is in the process of completing a large 144a
bond transaction for Union Tank Car Co.
   A CS First Boston spokesman declined to comment on the
Atlas Copco deal yesterday, citing regulatory restrictions
against public comment until the transaction closes.
   While some kinks remain in the procedures for bringing
such deals to market, the Atlas Copco offering is seen as a
successful maiden test for 144a-related stock offerings,
investment bankers said. Non-U.S. companies have shied from
U.S. markets because of SEC disclosure rules. Rule 144a
enabled Atlas Copco to avoid the extra paperwork. "We made no
changes to the offering circular that was distributed in
Europe other than stamping in red letters, `It's a 144a
transaction,'" said one securities executive.

   Avery International Corp., which last week agreed to merge

second-quarter net income to be "in excess of 10% below" the
year-ago level on a projected 5% sales increase.
   For the year-earlier quarter, Avery posted net of $24.1
million, or 55 cents a share, on sales of $446 million.
Avery's fiscal second quarter ends today.

   Charles D. Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of
the Pasadena, Calif.-based company, told securities analysts
in New York that the expected lower earnings reflect
"significantly slower" demand by car makers and owners for
Avery's decorative films and labels.
   "Sales bookings turned up" in May, Mr. Miller said,
"encouraging us to believe the last half of the year could be
better than the first. Overall, we continue to believe that
for the full year we can exceed last year's results."

more than 1.5 million shares in New York Stock Exchange

   Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. reduced the value of its offer
to acquire Elmwood Federal Savings Bank by about $5 million,
to a revised price of about $22.8 million in stock.
   By mutual agreement, the two bank companies said that
Elmwood shareholders would receive 0.88 Susquehanna share for
each Elmwood share outstanding. Based on Susquehanna's
closing price of $17.75 a share, down 75 cents, in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, the transaction has a
value of $15.62 an Elmwood share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Elmwood, based in Media, Pa., has about 1.46 million
shares outstanding. Susquehanna, based in Lititz, Pa., has
about 7.96 million shares outstanding.
   In November, the two institutions agreed to a stock-swap
combination valued at about $19 for each Elmwood share, or a
total of about $27.7 million at then-current market prices.
   Susquehanna said the price was reduced due to "recent
changes in the market for bank stocks." Because the exchange
ratio for the proposed merger has been fixed, any further
change in Susquehanna's share price would alter the value of
the transaction, an Elmwood spokesman said.

   Stocks Rise Again in Day Marked
   By Big Sale of Armstrong's Shares

   NEW YORK -- The market climbed higher, but on weaker knees
than Tuesday.
   The session was marked late in the day by the sale of a
huge block of Armstrong World Industries' stock.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Traders say profit-taking has begun to sap the market's
strength and may mean more selling in the next few sessions.
   "We tickled the 2900 area {on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average} but the market wasn't enthusiastic enough," says
Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns.
   But Mr. Solomon didn't predict a change of course. Any
pull-back should set the stage for a summer rally that could
take the industrial average to 3000, he says.
   The industrial average surged at the opening, but fought
bouts of selling through the session. By 3:30 p.m. EDT, the
index had dropped into the red before recovering to a modest
8.07 point gain at 2878.56 -- its second high in the past two
sessions.
   The broader market tracked the blue chips, with Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-Stock Index also hitting a high at 360.86 on a
0.21 point rise. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
added 0.18 to 196.75, while the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
rose 0.25 to 335.67.
   Armstrong World Industries was the third-most active
stock, falling 1 1/2 to 35 3/4 after Canada's Belzberg family
sold its entire 11.7% stake in the company. Trading volume in
the stock reached about 5.1 million shares. Bear Stearns
handled the sell side of the 4.8 million share block, while
Goldman Sachs handled the buy side.
   The Belzbergs' attempts to win control of Armstrong were
crippled by a recent anti-takeover law passed by
Pennsylvania. The family recently won one seat on Armstrong's
board in a proxy fight, but failed to win three other seats.
   Big Board volume was a strong 199,540,000 shares, compared
with 137,410,000 shares Tuesday.
   Advancers led decliners, 803 to 691, with 523 stocks
ending unchanged.
   Mitch Meisler, executive vice president of world-wide
equities at Shearson Lehman Hutton, says that despite
selective profit-taking, institutions still have a healthy
appetite for stocks.
   "This market could take a breather any time, and that
could be soon, but there's still a lot of interest out
there," Mr. Meisler says.
   He adds that as the market gets extended, investors are
looking for value.
   And despite the recent sharp gains stock analysts say
there are still major areas where values can be found.
   David Dreman, managing director at Dreman Value
Management, says computer stocks, for example, may still have
room to move on the upside.
   "Taken over a three- or four-year period, the computer
area is still undervalued relative to the Dow {industrial
average} or S&amp;P 500," he says.
   He also sees good value in bank stocks, which have fallen
far behind the broader market as a result of worsening real
estate markets.
   Dividend-related trading boosted volume in two bank
stocks. First Interstate added 3/8 to 38 1/4 on volume
bloated by a block of 710,000 shares that was traded in the
morning. The block represents about 1.3% of the company's
total shares outstanding. First Interstate pays a
75-cent-ashare quarterly dividend, giving the stock a 7.8%
annual yield at its current trading price.
   First Bank Systems gained 3/4 to 15 1/2, on volume of more
than five million shares. A 2.5 million-share block,
representing about 4% of the banking concern's shares, was
traded in the early afternoon. First Bank will pay a 20.5
cent-dividend to holders of record today.
   In so-called dividend rolls, a buyer seeking dividend
income buys a block of stock and then sells it back to the
original owner at a slightly lower price. Settlement of the
trade is arranged making the short-term buyer the shareholder
of record for the dividend distribution.
   Traders say big volume in Texas Utilities was also
dividend related. The stock, which ended up 1/8 at 36 3/8 on
volume of 5.9 million shares, goes ex-dividend next week.
   International Business Machines gained 1 1/8 to 120 7/8 on
volume of more than 2.8 million shares.
   Global Marine was high on the most active list again,
adding 3/8 to 5 1/8. The stock has been active since a
private placement of 13.4 million shares was oversubscribed
last week.
   Wendy's gained 5/8 to 6 1/4 in active trading. Shearson
Lehman Hutton upgraded the stock and raised its earnings
estimates for the company.
   Wendy's chief executive officer, James W. Near, said
estimates that the company will earn eight cents to 10 cents
a share in the current second quarter are "low," according to
Dow Jones New Service.
   Walt Disney rose 6 to 125 3/4. Wertheim Schroder repeated
its "buy" recommendation on the stock, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Xerox fell 1 3/4 to 46 1/2. The Wall Street Journal's
"Heard On The Street" column cautioned that Xerox faces new
write-offs at its Crum &amp; Forster Insurance unit.
   L.A. Gear continued to slide, dropping 3 3/4 to 43 5/8 in
heavy trading. Profit-taking hit the stock Tuesday, clipping
off 1 3/4 points.
   Avery International dropped 1 1/2 to 24 3/4. The company
said it expects to report second-quarter net income as much
as 10% below the 55 cents a share reported in the
year-earlier quarter.
   Consolidated Edison of New York slipped 1 to 23 5/8.
Kidder Peabody cut its rating on the stock to a "hold" from a

   Circus Circus Enterprises slid 2 5/8 to 62 5/8. Late
Tuesday, Bear Stearns took the stock off its recommended list
and downgraded its rating to a "hold" from a "buy,"
Professional Investor Report said. Analysts say the stock's
price had risen too far, too fast.
   Bally Manufacturing fell 1 1/2 to 10 5/8 after a delayed
opening. The company has begun an offer to exchange shares of
its common stock for any and all of its 13 5/8% subordinated
debentures due Jan. 2, 2001.

company to 7.5% of the total shares outstanding. Fidenas
disclosed in filings that it is continuing discussions with
the company aimed at improving shareholder value.
   Par Pharmaceutical added 5/8 to 6 3/4. The company said it
completed the acquisition of the 40% minority interest in
Quad Pharmaceuticals from three individuals who had been

the Taipei stock market that began on Saturday.
   Equimark ended off 5/8 to 7 1/2 following the resignation
of the company's vice chairman Tuesday. The company said the
position won't be filled.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.35
to 362.91. The Amex volume totaled 16,295,340 shares,
compared with 11,437,945 shares Tuesday. There were 276
issues advancing, 293 declining and 259 were unchanged.

   Intel Corp. said it resolved to stop using ozone-damaging
chlorofluorocarbons at its manufacturing plants by 1992.
   The Santa Clara, Calif., company, which makes
microcomputer parts and systems, said it is starting "an
aggressive world-wide program" to find alternative
manufacturing techniques that don't rely on CFCs. Intel's
measures are in response to a federal goal to eliminate
industry's use of CFCs by the year 2000. The move is in line
with a tentative industrywide effort by chip makers to rid
the ozone-depleting emissions from their plants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Intel began this process three years ago, when it started
tracking CFC levels at its plants. Since then, Intel says it
has lowered its CFC use by about 30%, by experimenting with
new conservation and control methods.
   A company spokesman said the new equipment that Intel
plans to install to replace CFCs will cost several hundred
thousand dollars and "in the long run, it will probably be
cheaper." The entire program won't run more than several
million dollars, the spokesman said.

   Further Reduction in Supplies of Motor Fuel
   Helps Price Rally Triggered by Gasoline Hold On

   The oil-price rally triggered by gasoline began fading,
but held on because of an expected further reduction in
supplies of motor fuel.
   But supplies aren't shrinking as fast as many oil-market
participants thought.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Release of the industry's latest weekly oil statistics
showed an increase rather than the expected drawdown in U.S.
gasoline inventories. According to the report by the American
Petroleum Institute -- released after U.S. futures trading
closed -- gasoline inventories totaled 214.2 million barrels
as of Friday. Although that is below the 221.7 million
barrels of a year earlier, it is nearly 1.1 million barrels
higher than the level of the preceding week.
   The nation's inventories of crude oil and distillates,
which include heating oil, also gained last week by 2.1
million barrels and 737,000 barrels, respectively, according
to the API figures. But it was the level of gasoline on the
eve of the Memorial Day weekend, which traditionally marks
the beginning of the "driving season," that drew the
attention of oil-market participants.
   As a result, many traders considered the API report a
bearish signal for crude oil as well as motor fuel. Some
cited a drop of 20 cents to 25 cents a barrel in the cash
market for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude,
after the API report was released.
   The report will "take some of the momentum" out of the
market, said William Hinton, a Stotler &amp; Co. energy-futures
broker. Still, he said, gasoline inventories are somewhat
low. A more bearish factor, he said, was the rise in refinery
operations.
   "There was an increase of 492,000 barrels a day in
refinery runs, which means they will make more gasoline," he
said.
   Crude oil rallied in early trading yesterday on fears that
an earthquake in Romania and the southern part of the Soviet
Union might have damaged oil facilities. But there wasn't any
report of damages.
   Reports of shutdowns and other problems in some U.S.
refineries helped support crude and kept gasoline firm
through much of the day. In U.S. futures trading, July crude
broke through the technically important level of $18 a barrel
to settle at $18.08, up 10 cents. The August crude contract
was up six cents to $18.64.
   In a contra-seasonal move, heating oil also was strong.
The June and July heating-oil contracts on the New York
Mercantile Exchange were up 0.91 cent and 0.66 cent a gallon,
respectively.
   The really big futures price jump came in unleaded
gasoline for June delivery. Today is the last day of trading
for the June contract; yesterday it rose 1.08 cents a gallon
to settle at 66.87 cents. The July contract increased 0.3
cent to 63.26 cents.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices fell with the July contract
settling one cent a pound lower at $1.1150. The market opened
weak because of softness in the London market and the U.S.
Commerce Department's news that sales of new single-family
homes fell to a 546,000 annual rate in April, its lowest
level since December 1982. John Gross, publisher of the
Copper Journal, says the market has been pressured by
increasing copper stocks. Copper in New York's Commodity
Exchange warehouses rose to 14,871 tons as of Tuesday night;
stocks were as low as 2,334 tons on March 23. London Metal
Exchange warehouse stock rose to 84,988 tons on May 25 from
65,174 tons at the end of March. Mr. Gross also said a report
of an earthquake in Peru Wednesday steadied the market. He
added that the most recent housing starts figures are
anything but encouraging. "The annualized rate {of housing
starts} in April was 1.2 million units," Mr. Gross says.
"That number can be compared with an actual 1989 rate of 1.37
million units and 1.49 million units in 1988." Philip
Gotthelf, publisher of Commodity Futures Forecast, says most
technicians see copper maintaining a trading range between
$1.18 and $1.08 a pound. He adds, "I believe that a lot of
traders are just waiting for an opportunity to sell July
copper above $1.1750 on the theory that there is a lot of
overhead resistance above the contract high of $1.1925" a
pound.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn-futures contracts sank
amid forecasts that dry weather will let Midwest farmers
resume planting a crop that has been delayed by wet weather.
Corn farmers have planted 81% of their fields compared with a
normal rate of 94%. If farmers can rapidly complete planting,
their crops stand a better chance of enduring the summer. By
June, farmers avoid planting corn because the crop would
reach pollination in midsummer when it is the most vulnerable
to hot and dry weather. Some analysts doubt the dry weather
will last, however, and have begun to cut their estimates of
how many acres of corn will be planted this spring. Katharina
Zimmer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, New York, said the
planting delay prompted her to reduce her estimate to 75.5
million acres. Earlier this spring, she expected corn farmers
to plant about 76 million acres. Instead of corn, farmers
will probably plant other crops such as soybeans, which can
be planted into June. Planting of soybeans, however, is also
lagging. About 25% of the soybean crop is planted compared
with a normal rate of 60% by this time of the year. Prices of
soybean-futures contracts fell.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices fell. The July contract opened near
Tuesday's close and, failing to sustain any upward move, sank
to 13.53 cents a pound before closing at 13.71 cents. Mr.
Gotthelf of Commodity Futures Forecast said most of the
action was tied to a follow-through of Tuesday's selling. He
also said the U.S. must again liberalize its import quotas on
sugar to remain in accord with the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. U.S. import quotas have been increased
twice. Mr. Gotthelf said bulls are using the GATT accord to
make their case. "They believe that our liberalized quotas
will knock the U.S. price to under 20 cents and bring the
world price above 16 cents" because increased U.S. use will
draw supplies from the world market. He pointed out that July
sugar was above 16 cents briefly in early May before the
market quickly backed down. Mr. Gotthelf is also sympathetic
with the views of the World Food Council, which expects
countries in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to upgrade
their diet as their economies become less centralized. "I
believe that one of the first areas they will want to improve
is sweets. They will look to acquire a sweet tooth," Mr.
Gotthelf said. He also said most technical traders don't
expect July sugar to fall below the area of 13.50 cents a
pound.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: The July futures contract settled at 81.13 cents a
pound, down one cent, after it rose above Tuesday's
life-of-contract high of 82.15 cents a pound. Mr. Gotthelf
said reports from Louisiana indicate that the fields are
drying out rapidly in cotton-producing regions and that flood
damage won't be as severe as first feared. "We believe that
cotton above 80 cents a pound is a very dear commodity," said
Mr. Gotthelf, who added he would be a seller above that
price. He also pointed out that recent Commerce Department
reports show that retail sales are down, which will cut
demand for cotton.

Del Webb's anti-takeover provisions was approved by more than
78% of the holders who voted on the proposal, according to an

   The votes in favor of the proposal represented a majority

   Del Webb, a Phoenix, Ariz., real estate development
concern, had said last week that a preliminary report of
inspectors of election for its May 16 annual meeting
indicated that the resolution had passed.
   The resolution by Los Angeles-based Webcott, controlled by
Del Webb director James L. Cotter, requested that the board
redeem shareholder rights issued under a so-called "poison
pill" plan adopted last year. In April, Del Webb agreed to
several of Mr. Cotter's demands to avert a proxy fight at the
annual meeting. A poison pill plan is aimed at making hostile
takeovers prohibitively expensive.
   A special committee of the company's board will consider
options and make a report to the board regarding the
nonbinding resolution.

   Families Settle Feud,

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A feud between families owning two
blue jeans companies was settled out of court yesterday when
Jordache agreed to give back its half-interest in Guess.
   The settlement came after a four-month trial and during
the jury's third day of deliberations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The terms for division of about $106 million held in an
escrow account weren't disclosed. Attorneys said all parties
had agreed not to disclose disposition of funds.
   The family feud involved four Frenchborn Marciano brothers
-- Maurice, Armand, Paul and Georges -- who founded Guess in
1981, and three Israeli-born Nakash brothers -- Joe, Ralph
and Avi -- who own Jordache and who purchased a half-interest
in Guess in 1983.
   The partnership disintegrated into allegations of fraud
and double-dealing that led to two separate trials to resolve
the claims.
   "The parties agree and the court orders that the sale of
Guess stock by the Marcianos to the Nakashes is hereby
rescinded," said the settlement agreement filed in Los
Angeles Superior Court.
   Under terms of the accord, the Nakashes returned to the
Marcianos a half-interest in Guess that they bought for just
under $5 million. The Marcianos won an earlier court fight in
which a jury determined that the Nakashes had defrauded the
Marcianos when they purchased the interest in the
then-fledgling company.
   "It seemed like a senseless thing to ever have it happen,"
said Dennis Townsend, who was a juror in the lengthy trial.
"These people are supposedly such good friends, and it turned
into a war."

   Portfolio Insurance Is Back for Stocks in New Guise

<LP>
   A potent new form of portfolio insurance, the trading
strategy that helped exacerbate the 1987 crash, has crept
into the stock market, threatening to turn market drops into
deep plunges.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is taking a hard
look at "portfolio puts," a strategy using stock-index
options and futures that, like the now-discredited older
style of portfolio insurance, is used to protect
institutional investors against losses when the stock market
drops.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the SEC, portfolio puts were successfully
used to protect about $2 billion in institutional stock
holdings during the Oct. 13, 1989, minicrash, when the Dow
Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points, almost all in
the final 80 minutes of trading.
   The put strategy is part of a sophisticated "dynamic
hedging" technique done mainly through Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
and Salomon Brothers Inc., according to people familiar with
the Wall Street firms. Dynamic hedging "can have a severe
impact on the liquidity of the futures and securities
markets," the SEC warned in an agency report on the Oct. 13
plunge. Adds Richard Ketchum, the SEC's market-regulation
chief: "We're uncomfortable with the fact that firms are
choosing to use this kind of dynamic hedging strategy that
puts risks into the market."
   How widely is it used now? The SEC isn't quite sure,
although agency officials say it's far less than the $60
billion or so of portfolio insurance in place before the 1987
crash. Still, "it gets used most when the market has moved up
a lot," Mr. Ketchum says.
   As the Dow Jones average sets record highs, that makes the
SEC nervous. "The markets start to move again, and you sort
of wonder what happens," Mr. Ketchum adds.
   The big loser may be the small investor, who is almost
helpless on days like Oct. 13. Indeed, the revival of
portfolio insurance illustrates how the stock market is
increasingly being influenced by big investors using complex
strategies to manage their risk and to trade.
   Traditional portfolio insurance -- heavily used by
institutional investors before the 1987 crash but now almost
defunct -- uses stock-index futures to protect against loss
on stock investments. (Stock-index futures allow investors to
bet on a basket of stocks without owning the actual shares.)
   The goal of portfolio insurance is to provide more
protection against losses in falling markets, while reducing
hedges if a stock portfolio is doing well without them. But
the product proved to be a failure by the 1987 crash, when
hordes of institutions tried to get out the door at the same
time by selling stock-index futures, helping to drive the
stock market down sharply.
   Portfolio puts change the strategy slightly. A large
pension fund or insurance company that is concerned about its
stock portfolio buys stock-index options to protect that
investment. Those "put" options allow the institution to make
money if the market falls, balancing losses in its stock
portfolio.
   The options are sold by a brokerage firm as a service to
its largest clients, and the brokerage firm makes money when
the stock market goes up or remains flat. But the brokerage
firm has to pay out money to the pension fund or insurance
company if the stock market falls and the options become more
valuable. Unlike the traditional strategy, the brokerage
firms, rather than the institutions, take most of the risk.
   So, to hedge its own risk, the brokerage firm sells
stock-index futures contracts. That bet pays off if the
futures basket falls in price. And, if the stock market
continues to fall, the brokerage firm sells additional
futures or stocks to protect itself. As in the case of
traditional portfolio insurance, the selling kicks in at
"critical periods," the SEC says, accelerating price
declines.
   The problem for the markets comes on days like Oct. 13
when the stock, options and futures markets start to fall
precipitously. In that case, UAL Corp. announced that its
leveraged buy-out was collapsing. The markets reacted
fiercely, driving down prices in huge gaps. The brokerage
firms weren't hedged enough against what they owed the
institutions for options.
   So they scrambled to sell stocks -- and sold them in
droves. For example, the SEC says in its report that at 3:49
p.m. EST, just before the DJIA hit its bottom, down 200
points, the New York Stock Exchange floor was "hit by a spike
of program sell orders for 2.5 million shares from three
firms." The SEC declined to identify the three firms, but two
of them are believed to be Salomon and Morgan Stanley.
   The SEC report continues: "While all three firms indicated
that these programs were hedging transactions, two of the
firms, accounting for 2.08 million shares or 83% of this
spike, attributed their stock selling directly to hedging
risks from portfolio put strategies."
   Simply phrased, these firms executed massive sell orders
in the stock market at a point when the market could least
handle it.
   Morgan Stanley executives don't dispute the SEC's account
of events. But they defend portfolio puts, contending that
Morgan Stanley provides clients with a customized product
that is sometimes cheaper than options that trade in the
public market. And more importantly, they say, portfolio puts
keep huge institutions insulated from market declines and
prevent them from bailing out of the stock market when stocks
slide.
   "If they don't have these {hedging techniques} in place,
they are going to sell stock," says an official in Morgan
Stanley's futures trading operation. "Through our hedging
techniques we diffuse what we have to sell over longer
periods of time and over multiple markets," he says.
   By remaining insulated from the Oct. 13 plunge, some
institutions were able to focus on buying opportunities when
the stock market was down, adds another Morgan executive.
"When they have this downside protection, they will be much
more willing to step to the plate and do some buying," he
says. The stock market bounced back the next trading day,
Oct. 16, with the DJIA closing up 88.12 points.
   Salomon officials declined to discuss the SEC study. "Our
sales of stock on Oct. 13 were the result of hedging our
customers' commitments, which were made prior to Oct. 13,"
says Stanley Shopkorn, vice chairman and head of equity
trading at Salomon. He declined to elaborate.
   The SEC hasn't decided whether to take any action to curb
portfolio puts. It could consider forcing brokerage firms to
increase their capital if they write these options.
Meanwhile, "they have every right to do that" under current
rules, says the SEC's Mr. Ketchum.
   Morgan Stanley officials complained that the Big Board was
the only place traders could hedge increasingly risky options
positions on Oct. 13, because officials at Chicago and New
York exchanges had shut off all important stock-index options
markets in an effort to stem the market rout.
   For example, at 3:16 p.m. Eastern time, exchange officials
shut down options trading on the Standard &amp; Poor's 100-stock
index at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest
options market, because of market volatilty. Regulated by the
SEC, the CBOE is where portfolio insurers regularly hedge
their risks. The trading shutdown in the big options pit
created havoc and tremendous risk for hundreds of options
players. Immediately, the CBOE market makers began selling in
other stock and futures markets, including the Big Board.

Electron a darling of the stock market. The Waltham, Mass.,
company has promising products in such businesses as
pollution control, bomb and drug detection, and cogeneration,
or the production of energy from waste heat.
   Now, with the shares up 72% since the start of 1989, a
number of investors are turning cautious on the stock. Not
only is it trading at an above-market multiple of nearly 25
times the past 12 months' earnings, the skeptics say, but
those earnings depend nearly as much on clever financial
management as on operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Think of Thermo Electron as a big research-and-development
shop. Promising projects are partly spun off as new publicly
traded companies. There are five Thermo offspring at the
moment, and the company's chief financial officer, John N.
Hatsopoulos, says there may be 15 or more by the end of the
decade.
   Thermedics (62%-owned by Thermo Electron), makes devices
to detect bombs and drugs. Thermo Process Systems (77%-owned)
makes equipment to incinerate hazardous wastes and detoxify
contaminated soil. Thermo Instrument (80%-owned) makes
instruments to measure and control pollutants. Tecogen
(78%-owned) makes natural gas cogeneration units and is
working on a low-emission natural gas engine.
   Investors' pulses also race for a heart-assist device made
by Thermo Cardiosystems (39%-owned, mostly through
Thermedics). The parent company also has operations of its
own, mainly in building and operating cogeneration plants.
Last week it privately sold, for $8.5 million, a 10% interest
in the operating end of the business. With such products, and
a cash-rich balance sheet, it's little wonder that Thermo
Electron stock has surged 14% this year to yesterday's close
of 34 7/8, up 1/4, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
   Today's price would be easier to justify if the vast
majority of earnings came from operations, but recently that
hasn't been the case. In 1989, Thermo Electron earned about
$34.2 million before taxes ($24.6 million after taxes) on
sales of $579 million. But only about half of its profit came
from operations. Gains on issuance of stock in subsidiaries
were close to $17 million. (The "issuance" mainly took place
as holders of convertible debentures exchanged them for
stock.) Net interest income was about $2 million.
   There's nothing wrong with making money through savvy
financial management. But profits from financial engineering
probably aren't what many investors think of when they buy
Thermo Electron.
   Its multiple of nearly 25 times earnings at yesterday's
close makes the stock one of the priciest on the Big Board,
where the average stock's multiple is now about 16 -- and
that's above the historical norm itself. And Thermo
Electron's price is approaching 50 times last year's
operating earnings.
   Mr. Hatsopoulos, the company's financial chief and brother
of its chief executive officer, George N. Hatsopoulos, says
its percentage of profit from sources other than operations
"will come down dramatically over the next two or three
years." Without the partial spinoffs, he says, "we couldn't
afford to finance all these new ventures unless we were
General Electric."
   Wall Street analysts generally expect Thermo Electron to
earn about $1.60 a share this year, compared with $1.35 a
share in 1989, and to reach $1.90 a share next year.
Optimists such as Dick Martin of Louis Nicoud &amp; Associates
look for $2.05 a share in 1991.
   Even this still means the stock is selling at 17 times the
optimists' guesses for next year's earnings. But so what,
asks John Bowen, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in San
Diego. Thermo's major units, he says, are "right on the verge
of some good earnings," and "you've kind of got to throw the
P-E (price-earnings ratio) out the window."
   Not so fast, say skeptics. "The quality of earnings is
quite low" because non-operating earnings are such a large
portion of the mix, says Walter Peterson, analyst with
Ferris, Baker Watts. "Return on equity has been 11% to 12%.
That's disappointing for a reputed high-tech company." He's
also concerned about Thermo Instrument's pending acquisition
of Finnigan. It would give Thermo Instrument better
distribution in Europe, but Finnigan had been posting losses.
   Overall, Mr. Peterson rates Thermo Electron a hold. He
would buy if it drops much below $30 a share but would sell
at prices above $40.
   Mr. Hatsopoulos says the fair value is higher, maybe $50 a
share, based mainly on the current market value of Thermo
Electron's stakes in subsidiaries. The parent's share of the
various units has a current market value of about $43 a
share. He hastens to add that a corporate acquirer might pay
$70 to $80 a share for all the pieces.
   But several money managers who have sold the stock
recently say it is already fully priced. Others are holding
on to their Thermo Electron stock but wouldn't buy more at
today's prices. Roland W. Gillis, who manages the Keystone
S-4 Fund in Boston and owns more than 80,000 Thermo Electron
shares, says he would lighten his holdings if the stock moved
into the 40s and would buy more if the stock fell 10% from
recent levels.

   LA JOLLA, Calif. -- John C. Stiska was elected president
of Intermark Inc. and of its 52%-owned affiliate, Triton
Group Ltd. The executive also was endorsed to be the
companies' next chief executive officer.
   The companies' current chief executive, Charles R. Scott,
said that Mr. Stiska, 48 years old, will be groomed as his
"ultimate successor" after he retires. On June 1, Mr. Scott,
62, will relinquish the president's title and assume the
additional title of Intermark chairman, a vacant post. He is
also Triton chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Stiska is an attorney who has acted as special counsel
to Intermark's board of directors for the past 15 years.
Since 1987, he has been a partner in the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison.
   In March, Triton and Intermark announced an agreement to
combine the two holding companies. If the merger is
completed, Triton would become a wholly owned Intermark
subsidiary. The companies anticipate that shareholder
meetings to approve the transaction will be held in July.
   The two companies hold interests in numerous operating
companies in retailing, restaurants, real estate and other
industries.

with Bush.
   After concluding a brief visit to Canada, the Soviet
leader was welcomed by Secretary of State Baker for today's

plans to meet with South Korea's Roh in San Francisco, said
Moscow would resolve the Lithuanian independence crisis in

   Move by Greenwald, Viewed
   As Iacocca Heir, Is Seen
   Boosting Union's Effort

   Chrysler Corp. vice chairman Gerald Greenwald, the heir
apparent to succeed Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, is leaving the
No. 3 U.S. auto maker to lead a proposed buy-out of United
Airlines by UAL Corp.'s unions.
   Chrysler and UAL announced the move yesterday evening,
after the stock market closed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move was startling because, as recently as last
Friday, the 54-year-old executive instructed a Chrysler
spokesman to say there was "nothing to" reports that he might
join the buy-out.
   Since two other Chrysler vice presidents also recently
announced their departures, Mr. Greenwald's move creates
uncertainty at a time the No. 3 auto maker needs to focus on
regaining lost market share and boosting profitability.
   At Chrysler, Mr. Greenwald faced considerable personal
uncertainties: the auto maker's long-term viability as an
independent company, and whether the 65-year-old Mr. Iacocca
will actually retire at the end of next year, as tentatively
planned.
   Now Mr. Greenwald will face considerable risks. He will be
aligning himself with a transaction that financial analysts
and Wall Street investors have given only a 50-50 chance of
succeeding because of poor market conditions for financing
leveraged buy-outs.
   But Mr. Greenwald's presence provides the buy-out effort
with a major shot in the arm. The unions needed to show they
could attract credible management in order to secure bank
financing for the $4.38 billion deal. Mr. Greenwald, a
well-respected figure in financial circles, will spearhead
efforts to obtain financing, which must be completed by Aug.
9, union advisers said. If the takeover succeeds, Mr.
Greenwald would become the airline's chairman, replacing
Stephen M. Wolf.
   One takeover stock trader predicted yesterday's
developments could boost UAL's stock price by $5 a share
today. UAL stock, which has remained far below the nominal
$201-a-share price of the union bid, closed yesterday at
$150.875, down 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   "I was approached at the right time and with the right
challenge," said Mr. Greenwald, in a statement. "I've been
offered an opportunity to lead another great company during a
period of major transition and it's an opportunity I can't
turn down."
   Mr. Greenwald was a major architect of the financial
restructuring that led Chrysler out of near-bankruptcy in the
early 1980s.
   In his statement, Mr. Greenwald didn't indicate any
concern for the company he is leaving. "Future product
programs are on schedule and securely funded, product quality
has been steadily increasing, significant progress has been
made in reducing costs and, most important, our market share
has started to rebound from its April low," he said.
   But a Chrysler spokesman acknowledged that possible
uncertainty about Mr. Greenwald's personal future may have
played a role in his decision. Mr. Greenwald "is the heir
apparent here but that doesn't necessarily mean he'd be the
heir."
   The 65-year-old Mr. Iacocca signed a contract with
Chrysler that expires at the end of 1991. But recently, the
Chrysler chairman has been coy about whether he actually will
leave next year, telling audiences in Chicago and Los Angeles
that he hasn't made a decision about the matter.
   In a statement, Mr. Iacocca said Mr. Greenwald leaves
Chrysler "with my deep gratitude and highest respect for the
job he's done here. He has told me that it's time for him to
run his own show . . . he is a major management talent and
he'll have a chance to show it."
   The unions said Mr. Greenwald's name surfaced early in
their two-month search, which was managed by Spencer Stuart,
an executive-recruitment firm. In all, the unions considered
more than 50 names. Recently, the names were whittled down to
a list of about six managers, none of whom currently works
for airlines. The labor group said they ruled out any current
airline chief executives early in the search.
   If the takeover succeeds, Mr. Greenwald will be entering
unfamiliar territory. He has no previous airline experience.
However, UAL's unions said they were less concerned about
enlisting an executive with airline experience than in
tapping one they believe could work well with labor and
command Wall Street's respect.
   The labor group said it will probably seek an airline
executive to take the No. 2 post. Union advisers said they
will begin working on filling that position now that a
chairman candidate is on board. They also indicated they want
to keep several of the 40 members of UAL's current senior
management team.
   In his new role, Mr. Greenwald faces the daunting task of
leading the largest experiment ever in employee ownership,
where he will answer to a board of union leaders and their
hand-picked outside directors.
   At Chrysler, he got mixed reviews from labor leaders.
However, leaders of the three UAL unions praised him, with
John Peterpaul, vice president of the International
Association of Machinists, hailing him as "a top-notch
executive with a proven performance record who's shown he can
get along with workers."
   Mr. Peterpaul said the UAL union has agreed to pay Mr.
Greenwald $1.1 million a year over five years, which matches
the compensation package Mr. Greenwald received from Chrysler
in 1989. He will also be compensated for Chrysler stock
options he lost and given an undisclosed amount of UAL stock.
   UAL paid current chairman Mr. Wolf a $6.7 million bonus to
take the job.
   Chrysler didn't say whether it will replace Mr. Greenwald,
or who will assume his current duties, which include acting
as adviser and sounding board for Mr. Iacocca and overseeing
Chrysler's technology, financial, international, parts,
quality and productivity operations.
   "There's no shortage of very able executives at Chrysler"
who would like to assume his mantle as Mr. Iacocca's
successor, however, said David Healy, a long-time automobile
industry analyst.
   The prime candidates are Robert A. Lutz, the 58-year-old
president of Chrysler Motors, and Robert S. Miller Jr., 48,
executive vice president and chief financial officer.
   A possible third candidate could be Bennett E. Bidwell,
62, chairman of Chrysler Motors. But Mr. Bidwell has broadly
hinted that he might take early retirement, although he told
reporters recently he won't retire in 1990. He hasn't ruled
out a departure after that, however.
   The Chrysler spokesman downplayed the timing of Mr.
Greenwald's announcement -- coming within two weeks of
similar announcements by Chrysler's treasurer and vice
president of international operations.
   "I know what it looks like," he said. "But I don't think
these three are in any way, shape or form related."
   Still, Chrysler faces considerable challenges as it enters
a two-year period that will prove critical to its long-term
survival. Among the problems it faces are a dearth of
all-new, high-volume cars until at least 1992. In addition,
even though the company is introducing a new minivan this
fall, production constraints currently prevent Chrysler from
boosting output much above traditional capacity levels --
which means no big boost in sales.

   TOKYO -- The Ministry of International Trade and Industry
officially approved a standard for digital audio tape players
Wednesday, clearing the way for Japanese makers to produce
machines for the mass market.
   A year ago, the major hardware makers from Japan and
Europe agreed on a standard for the equipment, but they had
to seek clearance from their governments. DAT machines
reproduce sound more clearly and accurately than conventional
tapes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Spokesmen from Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., which makes Panasonic equipment, said the
companies will probably start selling machines in the U.S.
later this year.
   It still isn't clear, however, whether record companies
will produce the necessary software for the machines. Many
record companies have expressed concern that the DAT machines
will encourage greater private copying in violation of
copyright rules. The standard is supposed to discourage such
behavior by limiting the ability of the tapes to copy from
compact disks.
   Some Japanese companies displayed DAT machines at the Las
Vegas, Nev., consumer electronics show earlier this year, but
those were only prototypes, a ministry official said. More
companies will probably display such machines at the
electronics show in Chicago, which opens Saturday.

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Former Arkla Inc. executive Sheffield
Nelson won the Republican nomination for governor of
Arkansas, besting Tommy Robinson in a bitterly personal
campaign.
   The defeat of Mr. Robinson, a flamboyant U.S. congressman
who described himself as a "junkyard dog," was also a setback
for the powerful Little Rock investment-banking firm of
Stephens Inc. Chairman Jackson T. Stephens heavily backed Mr.
Robinson, causing Mr. Nelson to charge that the chairman was
out to destroy him politically.

   Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton, who's widely thought to
harbor presidential ambitions, won renomination for a fifth
term. But the governor's percentage of the vote, about 54% in
a six-candidate race, was lower than expected.
   Mr. Nelson is the former chief executive officer of
Shreveport-based Arkla, owner of Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Co.
He's a Democrat-turned-Republican, as is Rep. Robinson, whose
political conversion was announced by President Bush last
year.

   NEW YORK -- Blackstone Group said Richard Ravitch, the
former public official and turnaround specialist who ran
unsuccessfully for mayor of New York in 1989, will join the
investment boutique as a general partner.
   Mr. Ravitch, who will start work tomorrow, said he will
focus mainly on restructuring over-leveraged companies -- "of
which there will be many in the 1990s" -- and on
recapitalizing troubled thrifts and other financial
institutions. He also said he will scout out prospects for
Blackstone's $800 million buy-out and investment fund.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Everything he does will be tied in some way to his past
experience and background," said Jerome Traum, a Blackstone
general partner.
   Mr. Ravitch, 56 years old, is known mainly for his
chairmanship during the mid-1970s of the New York State Urban
Development Corporation, which he is credited with saving
from bankruptcy; and for heading the New York State
Metropolitan Transit Authority, which he saw through a bitter
transit strike in 1980 and spent until 1984 rebuilding with
bond issues and innovative financing.
   His bailout plan for the UDC became the model for the
Municipal Assistance Corporation, created in 1975 to help New
York City out of its fiscal crisis.
   Mr. Ravitch has also served as chairman of HRH
Construction, a developer of several major New York office
buildings and residential projects. In 1985 he led a group of
investors who bought, ran and resold in 1988 -- at a big
profit -- New York's Bowery Savings Bank. "That's one of the
most successful turnarounds that has ever taken place," said
Mr. Traum.
   Since 1989, Mr. Ravitch has concentrated on writing,
teaching at New York University and seeking new opportunities
in business.

   Speaking of Business:
   Europe '92? It's Mostly a Break for the Americans

   If the European Community can get all its internal
problems ironed out (How does Eastern Europe fit into this?
How much sovereignty is each of us willing to give up? Can we
all get along with Mrs. Thatcher?), a new Europe will start
business in 1992. People, money and trade will flow freely
across borders without the restrictions that now apply.
   Some Americans are frightened by the prospect of this
development. They figure that the free internal market will
produce much larger and more competitive European firms that
will win sales away from U.S. companies both in Europe and
elsewhere. They fear that the Europeans will become
increasingly protectionist, trying to guard their expanded
market against Americans and all other outsiders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such fears are by no means new. When the Common Market was
founded in 1958, there were many who saw a plot to screen out
American goods. One result was a continuing increase in U.S.
investment in plant and equipment in Europe -- an investment
that helps to make the Europe '92 fears largely unfounded.
   Whether by plan or by luck, such investment prepared U.S.
firms both for the EC as it was and the EC as it evolved. The
community was formed in 1958 with six members: Belgium,
France, Italy, West Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
Over the years the group added Denmark, Greece, Ireland, the
United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. When a new nation
entered, it usually was already a base for U.S. firms.
   The prime example is the U.K., which became a member of
the EC in 1973. In 1966, not surprisingly, our neighbor
Canada was the host to the largest number of American firms,
but the U.K. already ranked second or third in most
industries.
   As a result, there has been no last-minute surge of U.S.
investment in the EC to prepare for Europe '92. In National
Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 3293, Robert E.
Lipsey of Queens College says the lack of expansion plans by
U.S. companies already in the EC may reflect satisfaction
with their current positions. "There is a widespread feeling
that American firms already established in Europe are already
ahead of European firms in treating the EC as a single
market," Mr. Lipsey writes.
   The author quotes a British magazine, the Economist, as
saying that General Motors and Ford have more "Europewide
strength" than any of their local competitors, strong though
many of them may be in their own national markets. The same
is true in their fields for other American companies such as
IBM, Digital Equipment and Unisys.
   Protectionism is no particular worry, moreover, because
U.S. manufacturing affiliates and even wholesale trade
affiliates in the EC are largely independent of imports from
the U.S. For manufacturing affiliates, imports from the U.S.
account for about 5% of sales in the EC.
   A lot of the merger and acquisition activity in the recent
past and in the near future is likely to involve European
companies seeking partners to extend their reach more widely
around Europe. The Economist suggests that some EC firms may
try to do this with mergers, joint ventures or other
arrangements with U.S. firms already in Europe.
   U.S. companies now outside the EC are in fact engaging in
some such transactions with EC firms; sometimes the prime
beneficiary is the U.S. firm. General Mills, for instance,
has announced a venture with Nestle to sell breakfast food in
Europe where General Mills's main rival, Kellogg, is already
entrenched as a producer. The cost of the plan was estimated
in the tens of millions, not an amount that would qualify as
a major international investment.
   The available evidence indicates it is unlikely that there
will be any rush of U.S. firms to enter Europe before 1992.
"It is hard to find evidence on rates of new entry," Mr.
Lipsey says, "but a survey conducted for KPMG Peat Marwick,
among a sample of executives in almost 600 companies in high
technology, other manufacturing, transportation, and
merchandising, found that of those (29% of the total) not
currently doing business in the EC, over two thirds said they
had no plans to do business there either before or after
1992."
   Only 6% of the sample project some sort of entry into the
EC before 1992. Surveys indicate a large proportion of the
new entrants will opt for joint ventures -- an unusual
decision for U.S. firms, which usually prefer 100% ownership
or at least majority control of any foreign operations.
Opting for joint ventures obviously limits the investment,
and thus it is not a strong indication of a pell-mell rush to
participate. Some of the joint venturers may be smaller
firms, interested in a piece of the action but unable to buy
a large piece.
   Another reason for U.S. firms to participate in joint
ventures, Mr. Lipsey suggests, is to have an opportunity to
enter markets dominated by public procurement; that probably
led to the recently launched joint AT&amp;T-Philips venture to
produce telecommunications equipment.
   There is no intention here to suggest that U.S. companies
are losing interest in doing business in Europe -- or are
blind to the 1992 deadline. Some companies are entering
Europe for the first time, and when this happens the firms
nearly always list 1992 as one of the reasons. It was cited
last year, for instance, when Intel announced plans to build
a $400 million computer plant in Ireland.
   But U.S. corporations have been doing business in Europe
for a very long time, and they're accustomed to the fact that
the rules and circumstances sometimes do change in Europe,
pretty much as they do in the U.S. An intelligent U.S.
businessman tries to stay alert and, if possible, adjust to
such changes even before they happen.
   This time, at least, it looks like the Yanks did a pretty
good job.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Xerox in Talks With Agencies
   About a Domestic Ad Project

   Xerox Corp., a major blue-chip client of Backer Spielvogel
Bates, is talking to other agencies about its advertising,
industry executives said.
   The executives said Xerox has asked the agencies on its
roster to compete for a domestic advertising project. Backer,
a unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, typically handles most of
Xerox's domestic account, which billed close to $20 million
last year. The other agencies on the big electronics
company's roster include Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Young &amp; Rubicam and
Lowe Marschalk.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rumors have been swirling for months that Xerox was about
to put its account at Backer up for review. The loss would be
a painful one, especially since Backer lost the $60 million
Prudential Insurance account earlier this year.
   But one of the executives involved in the pitch for the ad
project stressed that the full account isn't up for review.
"I'm sure that they aren't even thinking review," he said.
"They have a little problem; if (an agency) is on a roster of
a client, it helps out on things that aren't its account.
This happens quite often. It's a way a client can get help
without putting their account up for review."
   Xerox executives couldn't be reached, and executives at
the agencies involved declined comment. However, all three
agencies aside from Backer have been hoping to pry away the
domestic business from Backer, whose predecessor agency Ted
Bates snared the account in 1986. "We've been chasing the
business for years," conceded an executive at one of the
competing agencies, who asked not to be identified. Clearly,
the competing agencies are hoping the project work will turn
into a bigger chunk of the domestic business.
   All three agencies have powerful reasons for coveting more
Xerox work. Ogilvy, a unit of WPP Group, has been working
desperately to turn around its troubled New York office.
Earlier this month, it picked up the $45 million Eastern
Airlines account, its first major win in more than two years.
Another prestigious win would help wipe out the poor morale
and problems stemming from account losses and management
turnover that have plagued the agency's New York office for
several years. Ogilvy currently handles some direct response
work for Xerox.
   Lowe Marschalk, which also handles some Xerox direct
response work, has been trying to build its roster of
blue-chip clients. It recently won the Prudential account
away from Backer. Young &amp; Rubicam, meanwhile, is among the
most competitive of all agencies. After some setbacks last
year, including lawsuits -- later settled -- involving its
backing of a start-up agency and its work on the Jamaica
account, it also is looking for a big win.
   The agencies have been unsuccessful so far, though, in
wooing the Xerox account away from Backer, despite persistent
rumors to the contrary. Backer's hallmark is its service, and
its hands-on attention from its chairman, Carl Spielvogel.
Mr. Spielvogel was traveling and couldn't be reached for
comment.

   Ella Fitzgerald: Songbird Lives

   Last spring jazz impresario Norman Granz, who among other
things has produced most of Ella Fitzgerald's records since
1956, mentioned casually to me that he was doing an album
with Fitzgerald in a week. I was surprised. Neither had been
in a studio for nearly four years. I wanted to be there.
   "Do you think I could be a fly on the wall," I asked.
Okay, he said, but he'd have to check with Ella first. A few
days later he called back. "Sorry," he said. "It's her first
session in a long time, and she's not that sure of herself or
how well it will go. She'd rather not."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   ". . . Not sure of herself." It sounded ominous. After
all, she'd been hospitalized for respiratory problems in
1985; undergone bypass surgery in August 1986; and cut back
her concerts to fewer than a dozen a year since. Under the
circumstances, what could one expect?
   A few weeks ago the album came out, "All that Jazz" (Pablo
Records 3210-398, all formats). And it is proof of what comes
when a frail-looking, semi-retired, 72-year-old singer,
perhaps insecure in her music, tries for a feeble last
hurrah. Right? Well surprise] It's a wonderful album. Backed
by Benny Carter, Clark Terry and Harry Edison, she moves
gracefully through 10 standards ("Dream a Little Dream of
Me," "Jersey Bounce") with command to spare.
   There's nothing frail about Ella Fitzgerald. In fact, 1990
will be her busiest year in a long time. Her company, Salle
Productions (Ellas spelled backward), has scheduled nearly 30
concerts, including Minneapolis June 16 and the New York JVC
Jazz Festival June 29.
   To see her craft in context, it may help to remember that
inside every singer there lives an actor and a musician. The
actor aims for the heart and soul; the musician, for the head
and feet. But each singer ultimately leans one way at the
expense of the other, so it's the actor-musician ratio that
ultimately defines a singer's most fundamental focus.
Singer-actors see a lyric as a role. They inhabit its
character and magnify its emotions by making you believe it's
their personal statement.
   The secret of artists from Al Jolson to Judy Garland to
almost any rock singer is their sense of theater, not their
musicology. Singer-musicians, on the other hand, tackle a
song more in instrumental terms. The drama of its lyric is
less important than the abstractness of its melodic and
harmonic logic. And when words get in the way, they twist
them into knots or toss them off entirely in favor of
wordless voice-as-an-instrument improvisation.
   Singers from Louis Armstrong to Mel Torme to Bobby
McFerrin make up a line of musicians who happen to sing. And
bestriding this lineage like the proverbial colossus is Ella
Fitzgerald.
   If her clear, youthful voice has been nature's gift to her
art, the musicianship that drives it is all hers. Yet it was
fate, not training, that led her into singing only after
dancing failed. She joined the Chick Webb band at 17 in 1935
and quickly made it her appendage. Decca saw to it that most
of Webb's records featured her vocals. Today they hold up
poorly.
   Her sound is adolescent. Her style follows period pop
conventions. And for every good tune she gets ("Don't Worry
'Bout Me"), there are a dozen pieces of junk ("Chew Your
Bubble Gum"). After Webb's death in 1939, Decca built her as
a single, and for the next 17 years she muddled along as a
moderately interesting pop singer who sang what she was told
and never got out of second gear. Today there is not a single
CD in release from Fitzgerald's long Decca era.
   By the late '40s, though, there was another Ella emerging,
one nurtured and managed by Mr. Granz. This Ella sang only
the best songs. And in Granz's open-ended "Jazz at the
Philharmonic" concerts she had the space and freedom to
perform with the finest musicians of her generation.
   Fitzgerald had always had a knack for mimicking other
singers. In the JATP concerts she began mimicking the
musicians. She coined an uncanny vocabulary of semiverbal
onomatopoeia that expressed the subtlest nuances of swing
improvisation -- its attack, smears, curves, phrasing,
vibrato and pulse. Coupled with an overdrive falsetto
reserve, she met players such as Oscar Peterson and Ben
Webster on their terms and dazzled audiences. ("Ella
Fitzgerald at the Opera House" on a Verve/PolyGram CD is a
superb 1957 sampling of her JATP fireworks.)
   There was a problem, though. Mr. Granz may have managed
Ella, but Decca still managed her recording career, which was
not distinguished. For 10 years she was partitioned between
two sovereigns. Then in 1956 fate handed Mr. Granz powerful
leverage. Decca, which owned Universal Pictures, was
anticipating with pleasure big profits from the soundtrack
album of Universal's "Benny Goodman Story." Until, that is,
Mr. Granz jumped out of the bushes waving exclusive contracts
with most of the film's star musicians.
   His price for their release? A buy-out of Fitzgerald's
contract. Decca reluctantly surrendered, and a reunified Ella
Fitzgerald promptly went to Mr. Granz's Verve label.
   There, in the second week of February 1956, she made the
first of the masterpieces that would put her among the
immortals: "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book"
(Verve/PolyGram CD 82l-989/990). Other song books followed --
Ellington, Gershwin, Berlin, Rodgers, etc. Then loads of
Pablo albums in the '70s and '80s with everyone from Count
Basie to Andre Previn to Nelson Riddle.
   What does this body of work tell us about Fitzgerald and
her contributions? First, her song books have helped change
the way we think about our popular music. Without being
stuffy about it, she showed that it was all right to take
good popular music seriously; that the best of it had a life
outside the zeitgeist that produced it; that there was an
almost classical essence inside it that could be given
something approaching a definitive interpretation.
   She treated our greatest songwriters as composers; their
music as a body of work. A lot of the respectability that
"the American popular song" enjoys today exists because
Fitzgerald sang it. She has served both art and commerce
without pandering. Her commercial albums have shown a respect
for the mass market rare in popular culture. And her jazz
albums have been so consistently good, critics seem to have
given up finding fault, except perhaps for the creeping
redundancy of the Pablos. As for me, I'd rather hear her
fifth version of "Don't Be That Way" any day than not hear
her at all. Or worse, hear her sing the Barry Manilow song
book.
   Although her mannerisms are familiar, her technique and
sense of proportion have held them in balance. Fifty-five
years in the big time -- 30 of them as an icon -- have not
come between Ella and the kind of artist she is. She never
fell into the kind of self-caricature that, say, Billie
Holiday became. Self-destruction brought out the actor in
Billie at the expense of the musician. If the musician in
Fitzgerald should ever fail, the actor in her could not pick
up the slack.
   Few singers are as dependent upon pure musicianship as she
is. Or have such reserves of it. More important still, she's
never groveled to the god of nostalgia because she's never
attached herself to the cycles of fashion that nostalgia
feeds on. The elite aesthetics Mr. Granz has underwritten for
her these 34 years have given her distance without isolation
in the protected sanctuary of mainstream jazz. If she had
self doubts, she never embarrassed us with them by doing Cole
Porter in disco (as her only peer, Frank Sinatra, once did).
Her values have been as consistent as her musicianship. It
hardly matters now that she no longer seriously scouts for
new repertoire. Her core capital appreciates more every year.
