   Taiwan's Plan to Open Banking Industry
   To Foreigners May Increase Competition

   HONG KONG -- Taiwan's plans to give foreign banks greater
access to the country's long-protected banking industry
during the next year are likely to heat up competition in a
sector already simmering from recent liberalization measures.
   "The whole industry is going to get blown wide open," says
John Engle, chief country officer for Hoare Govett Securities
Taiwan Ltd. "It's going to be a very big year."

   That isn't to say Taipei will soon be edging out Hong Kong
or Tokyo as regional financial centers. The wheels of change
for the country's insulated financial sector were set in
motion only last year, with laws designed to liberalize
financial services, and the current proposals will take time
to bear fruit. Moreover, while the industry is relatively
underdeveloped and the amount of business expected to expand,
the onslaught of new banks at a time when the economy is
being hit by setbacks means some of them may have to swallow
red ink for a while.
   "It's a very competitive market already," says Edward
Chien, vice president of Hua Nan Commercial Bank, one of the
country's largest commercial banks.
   It's a safe bet that the country's large, government-owned
commercial banks will have a dominant role. Their main
domestic rivals will be the regional banks and the five to 10
new domestic institutions opening sometime next year. And as
foreign banks take advantage of the increased access, they
will assume small but significant roles.
   Among those outside entries, Japanese banks are piquing
interest by coming back to Taiwan after a 30-year absence
motivated by economic and political considerations.
   The huge government-owned commercial banks have an edge
with their existing branch networks countrywide. They also
are benefiting from the government's efforts to eliminate the
country's underground investment houses. The collapse of many
of these operations has sent depositors scurrying for the
safety of the commercial banks.
   The government also is now encouraging its commercial
banks to develop an international profile and help channel
Taiwan's huge cash reserves and corporate earnings into
investments around the world.
   "We are very, very strong in many areas," says Mr. Chien,
who thinks the regulatory changes will enhance the commercial
banks' advantages.
   But government ownership also sometimes undercuts their
competitiveness. A government plan to sell part of its stakes
in three of the biggest commercial banks, including Hua Nan,
flopped early this month.
   Only a few of the investors lucky enough to win the right
to some of the shares actually showed up to buy them because
the market price had sunk far below the sale price announced
by the government weeks before.
   The failure startled analysts at the time because the
banks' shares had been so popular that the government was
forced to hold a lottery to determine who could buy the
shares.
   But the tepid response now is thought to reflect poor
planning and a weak stock market rather than investor
sentiment on the future health of the banking industry. It
also reflected the common perception that bank shares in
general are overpriced and underscored the uncertainty those
old behemoths face in trying to evolve from a protected
market to a competitive one.
   Even if the government goes ahead with the sale as
expected in the next few months, the state will remain
majority shareholder, and it may take two years to complete
the privatization plan for those and other state-owned banks.
   Meanwhile, the commercial banks are saddled with
government-imposed budgets and hiring policies, which bank
officials fear will limit their ability to compete with new,
unfettered banks and some of the aggressive regional banks.
   "The pace of privatization has slowed, and perhaps the
government will go ahead and approve new banks while we are
still hand-tied," says Mr. Chien. "We are looking for a free
hand to do our own business."

   Commuting in L.A.
   Takes 50% Longer
   Than a Year Ago

   Although 79% Drive Alone,
   More People Are Aware
   Of Growing Alternatives

   LOS ANGELES -- Driving to work takes 50% longer than just
a year earlier here in the freeway capital of the U.S.
   The hassles of commuting have replaced real estate as the
main topic of cocktail party conversation. But although 79%
of residents still drive to work alone, more of them are at
least aware of a growing number of employer-offered
alternatives, ranging from car pooling to flexible job hours
and working at home.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Those are some of the results of the State of the Commute
Report, a survey by Commuter Transportation Services Inc., a
nonprofit Los Angeles organization, and the Southern
California Association of Governments. The survey questioned
1,254 residents of four counties, comparing answers with a
similar survey taken last year.
   For most commuters, their morning trip to work is still
about the same distance as it was a year ago, or 16 miles.
But it now takes half an hour, compared with 20 minutes
previously. Getting home in the evening takes 60% longer, or
40 minutes behind the wheel instead of 25 minutes.
   Trying to beat the traffic, 28% of commuters surveyed hit
the road at dawn to arrive at work before 7 a.m. Almost that
many head home before 4 p.m., while 13% wait until after 7
p.m. Only 14% use car pools and just 4% use public transit.
   Atlantic Richfield Co., based in downtown Los Angeles, has
encouraged car pooling for nearly 20 years. Currently,
employees get a 30% discount off their $85 monthly parking
fee for each extra rider. Some 70% of Los Angeles employees
at Transamerica Life Cos., a unit of San Francisco-based
Transamerica Corp., pick the early flextime shift, starting
between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
   The South Coast Air Quality Management District, charged
with controlling air pollution in the Los Angeles basin,
operates on a four-day workweek. It also has a pilot
"telecommuting" program.
   Eight million people who own 6.3 million registered
vehicles reside in Los Angeles County; an additional two
million people are expected to arrive in the next decade.
   Voters approved construction of a 150-mile rail and subway
system back in 1980. By 1994, 46 miles of the system are
supposed to be in service. Voters will consider two new
public-transit proposals in next month's primary election
that would raise $18.5 billion over the next 10 years for
freeway-improvement and rail projects.

   LONDON -- Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman of the U.K.
Securities Association, said yesterday that a Pan-European
financial services market will likely remain years away, even
though Europe is moving toward a single market in 1993.
   Mr. Yassukovich, a senior advisor to the U.S. brokerage
and investment banking house Merrill Lynch, and the former
chairman of its European and Middle East operations, told a
European Monetary Union (EMU) seminar that "it will be quite
some time before we have a truly Pan-European retail
financial services market."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He noted that even with the ongoing deregulation of
Europe's financial barriers, retail services will probably
remain checked by fundamental factors, most significantly the
extensive diversity of client demands throughout the
continent.
   Such diversity, he said, will likely continue to limit the
ability of financial services concerns to introduce products
that create economies of scale and profitability.
   "I don't think we're looking at anything as optimistic as
a quantum jump in Pan-European services (after single-market
regulations are fully implemented)," he added.
   The Merrill Lynch executive compared his company's 450
branch offices in the U.S. to the five it operates in West
Germany. He noted that Merrill Lynch is unable to offer
clients in Hamburg the same products it offers in Munich,
even though clients in both German cities "have the same
economic profile."
   "In the U.S. we are able to apply economies of scale (to
the range of products offered)," he said.
   Mr. Yassukovich stressed that this condition applies in
Europe strictly to retail markets, while he said that
wholesale financial services have operated on a Pan-European
basis for decades. He doesn't anticipate any significant
changes in the wholesale market after 1992.
   Regarding Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism
of the European Monetary System, Mr. Yassukovich said that he
didn't see the timing of the entry, or the government's
commitment to the system, as of significance to London as a
financial center.

   TOKYO -- Japan won't answer U.S. demands that Japan
completely liberalize interest rates on all bank deposits
within one year, a high Finance Ministry official said,
according to Kyodo News Service.
   U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford called for the
complete liberalization of Japanese rates Tuesday following
two days of U.S.-Japan financial market talks that ended with
both sides far apart on the question of how quickly
interest-rate deregulation in Japan should proceed.

<TEXT>
   At a joint news conference following the U.S.-Japan talks
Tuesday, Japan's Vice Finance Minister for International
Affairs Makoto Utsumi denied that Japanese banks are gaining
a substantial advantage from the continuation of some
interest-rate regulations. Mr. Utsumi said both countries
agree that further liberalization is desirable but disagree
on how quickly liberalization should proceed.

   Standing Up for Public-Interest Suits

   L. Gordon Crovitz complains in his April 18 Rule of Law
column, "Revised `Standing' Can Make Political Plaintiffs
Stand Down," that "activist" federal judges in the past 20
years have opened the floodgates to "obstructionist" suits by
liberal do-gooders by lowering the test for a plaintiff's
standing to sue in federal courts.
   This is a remarkable claim in light of a string of
well-known Supreme Court rulings since 1970 shutting the
courthouse door on "public-interest" litigants and setting
stricter requirements for standing. In these decisions, the
court has barred the Sierra Club from suing to block
construction of a highway across Sequoia National Park,
barred the parents of black publicschool children from
challenging tax exemptions for racially discriminatory public
schools, and barred welfare recipients from challenging an
IRS ruling relaxing requirements for hospitals to care for
the poor in order to be tax-exempt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When Mr. Crovitz cites with approval a Michigan Court of
Appeals opinion-in the form of a poem-dismissing the suit of
a homeowner whose tree was hit by a car, the column goes from
bad to verse. The Michigan court dismissed the homeowner's
claim because the driver was immune from suit under
Michigan's no-fault law, and the homeowner did not serve
process on the driver's insurance company. The case had
nothing to do with the requirements for standing, either in
Michigan or in the federal courts.
   Mr. Crovitz betrays even further misunderstanding of
standing when he complains that a federal appeals court
should not have allowed an environmentalist to sue to block
the Interior Department from opening up 180 million acres of
federal land to development when the environmentalist's only
allegation of injury was that her "recreational use and
aesthetic enjoyment of federal lands was threatened." But it
was not the court that declared such injury illegal. It was
Congress, when it passed the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act and directed the Interior Department to manage
federal lands in a manner that protects "scenic" value and
provides for "outdoor recreation."
   Robert N. Kravitz
   New York
   ---
   Invoking the writings of Justice Antonin Scalia, Mr.
Crovitz suggests that standing is a bulwark of our system of
separation of powers and that the foundations of the republic
will crumble if types like the National Wildlife Federation,
in order to protect wilderness and wildlife, can complain in
court that federal officials have violated acts of Congress.
What a load of snaildarter mulm.
   Yes, federal courts should refuse to render advisory
opinions at the request of intermeddlers with no real stake
in the issues. And yes, they should confine their holdings to
real "Cases and Controversies" as required by Article III of
the Constitution. But why shouldn't the average modern
environmental complaint clear that hurdle? In fact, many
lawsuits of the sort Mr. Crovitz so detests involve genuine
legal disputes of current importance, aggressively pursued by
sophisticated plaintiffs, in cases where nobody has a greater
claim of injury than the members of an environmental group.
This last element is crucial, and may explain best why our
courts entertain environmental claims that might have been
tossed out in years gone by.
   The question is not whether trees have standing -- a
notion on which Mr. Crovitz fixates with unthinking glee. The
question is whether courts will continue to fulfill their
traditional role of reviewing bureaucratic actions, even in
situations where illegality will not cost anybody money.
   Personally, I often oppose the positions of environmental
groups, and have done so in litigation. Unlike Mr. Crovitz,
however, I am not obsessed by the fear that the other side
might get a hearing.

   I thought John C. Goodman's April 11 editorial-page
commentary, "How Much Will an Operation Cost? Fat Chance of
Finding Out," raised some good points but missed the heart of
the issue.
   Most people are insulated from the price of health-care
services at the point of use. They do, however, routinely
make comparative cost choices when making decisions about
enrollment in one insurance program or another.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most patients are covered by insurance programs that have
agreements with hospitals at preset prices for a group of
services (i.e. Medicare will pay only a fixed price per
admission and many insurances pay a negotiated payment for
all services provided each day a patient is in the hospital).
In all cases a hospital is legally or contractually prevented
from billing the patient for the difference between the
actual charges and the preset payment.
   Quoting prices to patients will have little impact on the
cost or competitiveness of health-care services. More
informed consumers and payers may, however, realize that we
(as buyers and users) can make choices about what and how we
will pay for health care.

   ---
   Mr. Goodman's proposal that hospitals that treat Medicare
patients "should be required to quote pre-admission prices to
all patients" is an excellent way to help deal with runaway
medical-care costs. This simple reform could initiate much
needed price competition in a major segment of the
health-care delivery system.
   Hospital price information is flatly unavailable to
patients and largely unavailable to many third-party payers.
Hospitals rarely unbundle their fees for services or
supplies, thus optimizing their charges per admission but
making price-shopping by consumers impossible.
   A large number of hospitals do this through their
contracts with health-maintenance organizations, preferred
provider organizations and insurance companies. A more
consumer-friendly pricing system would have the major
advantage of helping the insured and uninsured alike.
   Critics will argue that price competition will affect the
quality of care. Not true. Patients' physicians will always
participate in the selection of the hospital. They can help
patients differentiate between good-quality, cost-efficient
hospitals and poor-quality, low-cost hospitals.
Unfortunately, many physicians have as much difficulty
differentiating between hospitals on the basis of price under
the current hospital pricing system as do their patients.
   Others will argue that physician "hospital privileges"
determine the selection of a hospital, not the patient. That
is true to a degree. However, many physicians ought to be
sensitive to their patients' financial constraints and should
willingly help them achieve a healthy outcome in an
economical way.
   Richard B. Berman
   Chairman
   The Partnership on Health Care and Employment

   ---
   What Mr. Goodman is really proposing is for hospital
business-office managers and financial departments to begin
practicing medicine and telephone diagnoses on the general
public. I've seen unusual propositions to reduce the costs of
health care, but this really is absurd.
   Hospitals literally each perform thousands of different
individual tests, procedures and services in millions of
possible combinations. Each and every patient may or may not
need more or less care and services, and there is no way to
incorporate accurately all the possible variances for every
possible procedure and combination of services for every
patient.
   Mr. Goodman's own examples of total charges for outpatient
services in Chicago are good examples of the range that
exists because of the scope of services required for
individual treatment and not because he is comparing
procedure costs on an "apples-to-apples" basis.

   State Budgets Groan, Credit Ratings Fall

   Northeast Is Hit Hard
   As Federal Role Shrinks

   NEW YORK -- As New York State thrashed out a desperately
late budget, school district treasurer Robert Finnerty
watched his carefully crafted safety net disintegrate.
   The seven-week-late budget marked the sixth consecutive
year the state missed its April 1 deadline -- forcing school
districts and towns to scramble for costly, short-term
borrowings and bruising the Empire State's credit rating.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Finnerty, a 26-year veteran of Fairport Central School
District near Rochester, N.Y., took defensive action last
December: Fairport borrowed $2.5 million, invested it in
certificates of deposit to help "take the sting out" of the
loan's cost, and waited. The strategy allowed the school
district to meet its $2.4 million April payroll while others
flailed for funds.
   Now, Fairport has borrowed another $3 million to meet
expenses due yesterday.
   Even though state legislators agreed on the $49.8 billion
budget last week, it will be some time before state aid
checks are in the mail. And that has Mr. Finnerty concerned.
"I'm worried about the competition, since everyone is out in
the market at the same time looking for funds," he says. But
he's even more worried about the trickle-down impact that the
state's fiscal woes will have on its future, long-term
borrowing power.
   And well he should be, according to a recent
credit-quality workshop run by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the
rating concern that recently knocked New York State's debt
down a notch. S&amp;P and many economists note that the burden of
funding environmental, social and similar programs is
increasingly being passed down to the state and local level
by a federal government eager for spending cuts. The
buck-passing is expected to be especially difficult on
Northeastern states beleaguered by economic slowdown, stalled
property values and aging infrastructures.
   Meanwhile, many local governments find their borrowing
power weakening. For all of 1989, S&amp;P downgraded $24 billion
of municipal debt. But during the first quarter of 1990
alone, it downgraded $23.2 billion, largely because of New
York State issues.
   S&amp;P's workshop assembled top finance officers of New York,
New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, who told analysts,
bankers and a few local officials, often with grim humor,
about their pummeled budgets. "The real `miracle' in
Massachusetts is they haven't killed each other yet," says
Richard Larkin, a managing director in S&amp;P's municipal
finance department, in introducing the session.
   Many of the other 46 states have similar problems. S&amp;P
says California, Florida, and North Carolina may be next on
the endangered credit list.
   "You've got to start watching California," says Hyman
Grossman, managing director of S&amp;P's municipal department.
Mr. Grossman cited a steady slowdown in military spending
(most recently reflected in heavy layoffs at McDonnell
Douglas Corp.'s West Coast operations) as well as weakness in
commercial real estate. As for the Sunshine State, Mr.
Grossman says: "We have a real estate bust in Southeast
Florida."
   North Carolina suffers from a problem affecting many
budgets: a major gap in projected corporate tax revenue. But
S&amp;P says the gap was exacerbated by capital-gains tax
miscalculations related to the RJR Nabisco Inc. leveraged
buy-out, among other things.
   New York State holds center stage at the moment, as it
proposes $1.4 billion in new taxes in the state with the
third-lowest bond rating in the country. The New York State
comptroller estimates some $3 billion in late school aid cost
districts about $400,000 a day in interest payments, or about
$20 million over about 50 days. The best guess on when
overdue state aid payments will reach the school districts is
the week of June 11.
   New York City and Buffalo have had to seek bridge loans to
tide them over until state revenue is apportioned. The Big
Apple, which faces a $105 million revenue gap of its own,
says borrowing because of the state's tardiness could cost it
$23 million in interest and other costs.
   In general, state credit ratings will be more difficult to
maintain; some 37 states expect revenue shortages in fiscal
1990. Meanwhile, the states are loath to raise taxes in this
election year. Still, Cathy Daicoff, a managing director in
S&amp;P's municipal finance department, interprets President
Bush's famous "lips" speech this way for the states: "Read my
lips: Raise your taxes."
   Of course, there are those who feel tax increases are
unconscionable, considering already-bloated levies and
laissez-faire administration. Chief among them is Martin
Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at
Stanford Univeristy.
   Mr. Anderson points out that both state and federal
revenues have continued to gush in at higher levels, year
after year. "The problem is they're just spending too much,"
Mr. Anderson says.
   Mickey Levy, chief economist of First Fidelity Bancorp.,
notes that the Eastern states are experiencing the same kind
of "restructuring" that has already happened in places like
the Midwest and Texas. While he stops short of forecasting
recession, Mr. Levy does see sluggishness in several
industries that requires reduced expectations. "In a sense,
elected officials on the East Coast are going through the
same kind of adjustments bankers are," he says.
   And Douglas C. Berman, New Jersey's treasurer, adds: "We
will never see the growth rates of 1983-87." With smaller
annual growth and larger infrastructure and social needs,
where will the revenues come from? "My guess is property
taxes are going up," he says. And "you will see a greater use
of state authorities," such as the turnpike office.
   Paring spending while shoring up creditworthiness may
sound simplistic, but it is exactly the point made repeatedly
at the S&amp;P workshop. "Credit ratings can be improved by
economic managers of these states," says S&amp;P's Mr Larkin. "A
lot of states have taken us up on establishing some kind of
`rainy day' fund. That's one thing I can't stress enough,"
says Mr. Larkin.
   That message isn't much help to troubled states that
drained their rainy-day funds some time ago. And it's no help
at all to Schroon, N.Y., and its frugal officials such as
John Kelly, town supervisor. Schroon, a self-professed "Town
of Recreational Beauty" in the Adirondacks with its own
nine-mile lake, has been bracing for a $1.5 million,
state-ordered closing of its landfill.
   "The states mandate a lot of things, but they don't put
their money where their mouth is," says Mr. Kelly. The town
(population: 1,650; annual budget $1,849,872) hasn't borrowed
any money to speak of since 1973, when it installed a public
sewer system. Mr. Kelly's been more than a little concerned
about the high cost of funds needed for the landfill closing.
So "we've been squirreling away money for the last five
years" in the general and water department funds, he says.
   So far, the town has saved about $289,000. But in
mid-April, Schroon got a letter from the state comptroller's
office noting the town has "no statutory authority for the
accumulation of excessive fund balances." The comptroller
suggested Schroon think about lowering its taxes.

   Steelmakers See Clean Air Bill Costing
   Them $5 Billion Over Next Five Years
   -----

   PITTSBURGH -- Clean Air is going to cost Big Steel big
bucks.
   Regardless of what version of the legislation is finally
signed into law, major steelmakers say they may have to spend
as much as $5 billion in the next five years to install new
technology to reduce hazardous emissions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ultimately the legislation may force an industry long
associated with soot and smokestacks to accelerate efforts to
find a new formula in the century-old process of making steel
with coke ovens. And the industry estimates that converting
to a new process could cost more than $30 billion.
   "Our big concern here is cost," says David M. Anderson,
general manager of environmental affairs at Bethlehem Steel
Corp., the nation's second-largest steelmaker. He notes that
the expected environmental spending could all but wipe out
the entire industry's capital spending budget, which has
averaged about $2 billion annually in recent years.
   Yet even the United Steelworkers union, whose members'
jobs could be threatened, doesn't entirely accept the
industry's dire predictions. Jack Sheehan, the union's chief
lobbyist in Washington, says the industry has a long
tradition of resisting environmental regulations even though
cleaner processes often result in greater efficiency.
   "The history of coke oven cleanups has been positive and
without massive shutdowns," he says.
   Still, the new Clean Air legislation has targeted the very
heart of steelmaking: coke-baked coal -- which fuels blast
furnaces. But the baking process, done in huge and sometimes
leaky ovens, releases what environmentalists contend are
harmful gases that can cause cancer.
   Both the House and Senate want steelmakers to install the
best technology available to rebuild older coke ovens and add
new doors and seals. Rebuilding a coke oven costs close to
$200 million. And the industry estimates that nearly half of
the nation's 94 coke ovens need rebuilding or new doors and
seals.
   Under the stricter Senate version of the Clean Air
legislation, coke ovens would have to meet tight emission
standards by the year 2020 or be automatically shut down, a
provision favored by environmentalists.
   Steelmakers balk at the shutdown provision. They say
technology doesn't exist -- and likely won't for decades --
that could meet the stricter guidelines. As a result,
steelmakers dourly predict the shutdown of virtually all coke
ovens, resulting in the loss of 25,000 jobs. Moreover, the
industry says it would be forced to buy coke from foreign
competitors, or build coke ovens overseas.
   "We'd just be exporting pollution and jobs," says Mr.
Anderson.
   The House version is more palatable to steelmakers. While
it would still require them to use the best available
technology to hold down coke-oven emissions, it doesn't have
an automatic shutdown provision, nor does it have specified
emission standards. The final shape of the bill will be
determined by a House-Senate conference committee.
   Steelmakers haven't ignored coke oven emissions. In fact,
in the past 20 years they claim emissions have dropped 90% as
the industry built more efficient -- and cleaner -- ways to
bake coal.
   "We have a much better record than people give us credit
for," says Frank Luerssen, chairman of Inland Steel
Industries Inc.
   Still, the industry has accepted the fact that its coke
ovens must be rebuilt on a more accelerated program. But
having to spend $5 billion to install new coke oven
technology, they assert, means less money available to
modernize plants.
   "We have limited resources and we have to husband those
resources," says Mr. Luerssen. Most steelmakers don't have
investment-grade securities, he notes, making borrowing
difficult and expensive. Nor have they been successful in
raising cash by selling equity. And options to share costs --
such as joint ventures, downsizing and employee stock
ownership programs -- are limited, they contend.
   If the ovens face possible automatic shutdown, it will be
even more difficult to persuade steelmakers, their
shareholders and lenders to spend money for newer and bigger
coke ovens. "You can't plan or invest," says Bethlehem's Mr.
Anderson.
   With coke's status as the obvious environmental culprit,
steelmakers around the world are experimenting with more than
40 processes to reduce dependence on the dirty substance.
   In the U.S., the American Iron and Steel Institute, the
industry's trade association, and the Department of Energy
are developing a $30 million pilot program near Pittsburgh to
make steel in one step without coke. The so-called direct
steelmaking process is a high research priority in both Japan
and Europe.
   Environmentalists have used the prospect of cokeless
steelmaking to lobby for an automatic shutdown of polluting
coke ovens, arguing that they won't be needed in the future.
   But steelmakers say direct steelmaking has been studied
for 50 years and isn't close to reality, let alone commercial
application.
   Inland's Mr. Luerssen, who ran an unsuccessful direct
steelmaking pilot program in the early 1960s, questions
whether an economical cokeless process can be developed. "I'm
not holding my breath," he says.
   Even if such a method were found, steelmakers simply can't
shut down all coke ovens one year and install the new process
the next. He notes that it took 40 years to fully adopt
oxygen steelmaking vessels and that was a "relatively simple
process compared to this."

   HIGH HOPES? Voters see the Soviet summit yielding even
better relations.
   Fifty-four percent say the impending meeting can
substantially improve ties, according to a new Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll. "Gorbachev's popularity is the
linchpin to U.S.-Soviet relations," say pollsters Peter Hart
and Robert Teeter, who conducted the survey for the Journal
and NBC. Despite the Soviet leader's Baltic, economic and
other woes, some 59% of U.S. voters view him positively, up
from 51% in December.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But skepticism remains. By 50% to 38%, voters oppose
helping strengthen the Soviet economy; in December, such
support was favored by 45% to 40%. Voters are closely divided
on whether the Soviets can be trusted to live up to
arms-control agreements. If Gorbachev were no longer in
power, voters would distrust the Soviets by three to one, but
64% predict he will still be in charge two years from now.
   Voters split evenly on whether Soviet recognition of
Lithuanian independence should be a condition of any new
accords -- something Bush won't demand, and Gorbachev
wouldn't accept.
                                                                                                       

   DUMP QUAYLE? Voters would rather see Baker as Bush's 1992
running mate.
   Those polled prefer the secretary of state for the ticket
over Quayle by nearly two to one; Republicans favor Baker by
43% to 35%. "Particularly if the economy is bad, the
president is going to have to choose someone else," asserts
one GOP strategist.
   Only 29% of the 1,007 registered voters surveyed between
Friday and Tuesday hold positive views of Quayle, while 37%
view him negatively; despite concerted administration efforts
to burnish the vice president's image, those numbers are
virtually identical to soundings taken last November and
March. Baker's positive-negative ratio is 44%-20%. On the
other hand, he still doesn't match Gorbachev's 59%-16%.
                                                                                                       

   VOTER EDGINESS could nudge Bush toward a budget deal with
Congress.
   While the president's job-approval remains high, at 72%,
the percentage who say the country is generally going in the
right direction dips to 42%-38%, down from 47%-32% a month
ago. Bush's slipping economic approval rating could also
provide impetus for an accord.
   White House aides insist that a genuine, long-term fix
would be a potent political winner, easily outweighing any
flak he takes if he goes back on his no-new-taxes pledge. But
some would prefer no deal at all to a modest one that might
make it appear he gave up too readily on taxes.
   A key to selling any deal, aides believe, will be
convincing Americans that it restores "sanity" to the budget
process.
                                                                                                       

   RECESSION FEARS return to earlier levels after a brief
burst of optimism last month. In the new Journal/NBC poll,
30% expect a downturn in the next year. That is up from 23%
last month, but equal to the figures for January and March.
                                                                                                       

   REPUBLICANS GAIN in voter intentions for this year's House
races. Thirty-four percent say they plan to vote for the GOP
candidate in their district, while 33% say they'll vote
Democratic. Democrats had been consistently leading in that
barometer since last September.
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS SEE a political edge in the pending
parental-leave bill. In the poll, nearly seven in 10 support
such a law even if it would mean additional costs to
businesses. Even some GOP lawmakers like Rep. Martin, running
for the Senate in Illinois, break with Bush on the issue.
                                                                                                       

   NO NUKES in Europe shouldn't be the U.S. goal, voters
believe. Seven of 10 agree that the U.S. should always
maintain some nuclear weapons there, while only 22% say
almost all such weapons should eventually be removed.
                                                                                                       

   HOSTAGE HOLDUP: Hope fades that more releases are coming.
   U.S. analysts say Lebanese Shiites rebuff Iran's bids for
more releases. Bush's small signals to Iran after Reed and
Polhill were freed fail to impress the hostage-holders as
expressions of good will. "They aren't viewing these as
reciprocal gestures," says one U.S. official. "They believed
us when we said they weren't linked to hostages."
   Bush remains wary of any stronger steps that might make it
appear he is negotiating with the terrorists. Voters in the
Journal/NBC poll approve his handling of the hostage
situation by two to one, but they are deeply split over
whether the U.S. should negotiate directly with the
hostage-holders; 48% oppose such dealings, while 45% favor
them.
   Forty-eight percent favor pressuring Israel to release
Arab prisoners to help gain the release of the U.S. hostages,
while 43% oppose such pressure.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Gender Gapski: While 64% of men view
Gorbachev positively, only 53% of women do. . . . Traitors to
their class? Fifty-seven percent of voters with incomes over
$50,000 would rather see higher taxes on upper-income
taxpayers than an increase in the gasoline tax. . . . The
G-8? By better than four to one, respondents would approve
inviting the Soviets to join in the economic summit of the
seven leading industrialized nations.

   Heredity Plays Major Role in Amount
   Of Fat a Person Gains, New Study Says

   Inheritance plays a major role in how much fat a person
accumulates and where it builds up on the body, a new study
of twins found.
   An experiment in Canada, in which identical twins ate a
high-calorie diet for more than three months, found that
weight gain and fat distribution in one twin was remarkably
similar to that of his fellow twin but markedly different
from that of other, unrelated individuals. As identical twins
have identical genes, this indicated that the genes each pair
of twins shared played an important role in determining their
weight gain and fat distribution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The study added new evidence that a predisposition to
being overweight or obese can be inherited. But scientists
cautioned against misinterpreting the new findings.
   "There is a risk" that publishing the results of the
studies "may lead the popular media to declare that what goes
on in the home really makes no difference" in whether a child
becomes an obese adult, warned an editorial published in this
week's New England Journal of Medicine where the two reports
were published.
   The studies don't mean that genes automatically dictate
that a person will be overweight or obese regardless of how
much or how little he or she eats. Instead, the genes
inherited from the parents merely influence the way the body
handles excess calories. In other words, a person could
inherit a predisposition to obesity but whether he actually
becomes obese could be influenced by eating habits.
   The Canadian experiment, carried out at Laval University
in Ste. Foy, Quebec, involved 12 pairs of male identical
twins who agreed to spend 100 days living with researchers in
a special dormitory. After they determined each man's
base-line daily calorie needs, the researchers made sure each
man ate an extra 1,000 calories a day six days a week. Thus,
over the 100 days each volunteer ate 84,000 more calories
than he needed.
   Weight gains varied widely among the 24 men, ranging from
five to 30 pounds per person over the 100 days. The aim of
the study was to find out how much of this difference among
individuals was due to hereditary factors and how much was
due to environmental factors, the excess calories in this
case.
   The researchers found that when comparing one twin with
his fellow twin, there was far less variation in weight gain
than seen in the group as a whole. This indicated that the
genes were having a major influence on how much of the extra
84,000 calories each person stored as fat.
   The researchers also found that increases in lean and fat
tissues in one twin was similar to that of his fellow twin
although such changes in the fat to lean ratio varied widely
among twin pairs. The same phenomenon was seen when the
distribution of newly gained fat was measured. If one twin
tended to gain fat in the abdominal skin, so did his twin.
Such correlation wasn't seen when comparing twin pairs.
   A second study at Pennsylvania State University of 93
pairs of identical twins separated early in life and reared
in different homes found that genetic factors were about
twice as important as the childhood home environment in
determining adult weight.
   The analysis, also published in the New England Journal,
found that each twin's body mass was more similar to his or
her identical but separated twin's body mass than it was to
other members of each twin's adoptive family.
   The researchers in the Pennsylvania State University study
estimated that genetic factors accounted for 70% of the
difference in body mass among individuals.

   Perkins Foods PLC Is Buying Up Firms
   In Effort to Develop European Network

   LONDON -- Perkins Foods PLC, a small but hungry British
concern, is buying up bits of northern Europe's fragmented
foods industry in hopes of building a coherent manufacturing
and marketing network.
   Chairman Howard Phillips says his company, which deals in
a number of items from fresh produce to frozen pizzas,
intends to buy as many as six closely held companies across
the region this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Our main area of development will be in added value
products," Mr. Phillips says, with the aim of capturing more
of the profit built into food goods at various stages on
their way to consumers.
   Earnings at Perkins have grown quickly in the two years
since Phillips and a new management team arrive. In 1989,
Perkins pretax profit more than tripled to 9.78 million
pounds ($16.5 million) from 2.84 million pounds in the
previous 15 months. Fully diluted per-share earnings stood at
7.8 pence, up 32% from 5.9 pence.
   Analysts expect pretax profit this year to rise 62% to
15.9 million pounds, with per-share earnings rising 17% to
9.15 pence. In 1991, they forecast a further 16% rise in
pretax profit to 18.5 million pounds and a 15% rise in
per-share earnings to 10.5 pence.
   With debt of just $1.6 million, gearing at 10% and a
strong cash flow, the company is in a strong position to make
still more acquisitions, says analyst Charlie Mills of London
stock brokers James Capel &amp; Co. Ltd.
   The type of foods company Phillips says he is looking for
is of medium size, already profitable with pretax earnings of
about 5 million pounds and with plenty of room for growth. He
isn't keen on buying large companies which might be past the
bloom of youth, or small ones which need extensive work to
get through start-up problems. Wherever possible, he wants
management to stay on.
   In 1987, an investment team led by Phillips and Michael
Davies, who with Phillips was once a director of Hanson PLC's
Imperial Foods Ltd., took an initial 12% stake in what was
then a largely family owned business, John Perkins Meats PLC.
   Phillips' management team quickly turned the company
upside-down. Perkins divested itself of the original meat
trading business and snapped up 12 companies for a total of
70 million pounds.
   In the process, Perkins has acquired a clutch of added
value units that include frozen food distributor Nuka, frozen
foodmaker Van der Made and mushroom canner Holland
Champignons.
   Peppinos, the West German pizza maker, remains among the
company's flagships. Costing an initial 34 million Deutsche
marks ($20.4 million), the frozen pizza maker gives Perkins
the first of other much-hoped-for acquisitions in West
Germany as prospects for a unified German market for food
grows ever-brighter. "We'd like very much to realize what's
happening there," he said.
   Phillips believes the Perkins strategy leave little to
recession, with business exposure spread among northern
Europe's healthiest economies.
   "We believe in spreading the risk and not exposing
ourselves too much in any one country," the chairman says.
While the British economy may be slowing, he adds, "I see
little evidence of a recession on the continent."
   Central to Perkins' vertical integration plans, says
Phillips, is the expansion of the company's frozen products
which include pizzas, potato snacks and seafood.
   Already, frozen-food manufacturing bases in Britain,
Germany and the Netherlands have boast sales outlets in
domestic markets and markets in Scandinavia, France, Belgium
and Italy thanks to a network of marketing and distributing
units including Perkins' Nuka and Sunbird subsidiaries.
   In its bid to extend the company still further, Perkins is
now considering Denmark, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland as
host countries to further acquisitions in a bid to extend the
company well into the 1990s.

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Probably no company in America will be
touched in more ways by the clean-air legislation now rolling
through Congress than Du Pont Co.
   As lawmakers work to reconcile the bill passed late
Wednesday by the House with a Senate-approved version, Du
Pont is scrambling to anticipate final details of the
landmark legislation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of companies will be hit by the new clean-air
requirements, but the anticipated impact on Du Pont, with its
vast array of products, illustrates the proposed law's
pervasive nature through the eyes of a single corporation.
"From a legislative standpoint, it has probably as
significant an effect on the company as anything else ever
has," says Bruce Karrh, Du Pont's vice president for
environmental affairs. The company, which once fought a new
clean-air law, now says it supports one.
   The wide-ranging bill will force factories, power plants,
cars, gasoline and eventually many other consumer products to
be less polluting, at a cost to industry and consumers that
the Bush administration estimates at $21.5 billion a year by
2005. Within 15 years, it aims to clean up the smog in all
cities except Los Angeles, partly by forcing oil companies to
develop cleaner-burning gasoline. For the first time, it
attacks the acid rain widely accused of harming lakes and
streams in New England by forcing coal-fired utilities to
sharply reduce emissions. Factories nationwide will have to
install new anti-pollution equipment to protect people living
and working nearby from dangerous fumes.
   Congress and President Bush are largely in agreement on
the clean-air provisions, although the White House is
threatening a veto because of House approval of special
unemployment benefits for workers who lose jobs because of
the law. The final legislation will be worked out in a
House-Senate conference.
   As the nation's fifth-biggest air polluter, based on
federal reports, Du Pont is a natural target for the public's
environmental demands. Name nearly any pollution attacked by
the clean-air legislation, and the giant company famous for
the Freon in refrigerators, the Teflon in cookware and the
nylon in Stainmaster carpets somehow shares the blame. Even
though Du Pont is also known as a corporate leader in
anti-pollution efforts, the final clean-air law will force a
series of tough requirements that will influence, for better
or worse, the future of its far-flung operations.
   At Du Pont's chemicals operations, plant managers are
wondering whether some production lines might have to be shut
down because of federal estimates suggesting that their fumes
pose cancer risks to people nearby. Refiners at its Conoco
subsidiary are alarmed at a new, probably very costly recipe
that Congress is writing for cleaner gasoline. Still in
question, too, is whether the law will deter Du Pont's U.S.
investment in substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, the
chemicals that it sells for use in refrigeration and
insulation and that are widely blamed for destroying the
Earth's protective layer of ozone.
   How the new law is finally written will go a long way in
determining how Du Pont spends its growing
environmental-equipment budget, now scheduled to nearly
double within one year to $500 million in 1991. That spending
could expand much more in the 1990s, especially to reduce
toxic emissions, if some of the two bills' tougher provisions
end up in the law. No fewer than 80 Du Pont chemical plants
from Delaware to Texas will fall under the law's mandates.
   But the law will reach beyond questions of where to
install better pollution filters and tighter valves. It will
probably cost jobs, particularly in Du Pont's Consolidation
Coal subsidiary. Consol estimates that acid-rain controls may
trigger the closing of as many as three of its four
high-sulfur mines on the Ohio River south of Wheeling, W.Va.,
and put up to 1,000 miners out of work in the depressed
region.
   Denny Pickens's job dispatching coal movements at Consol's
Shoemaker mine may ride on whether the Senate accepts a
single provision in the House bill. Without it, 337 miners,
including Mr. Pickens, his brother and most of his friends,
could be idled. Mr. Pickens, 38, says he would have to uproot
his family from Wheeling to find a new job. "Except for
flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, I don't know what I'd do
around here," he says. "I just think it's a God-awful shame."
   Within the huge scope of Du Pont, whose 1989 sales totaled
$35.5 billion, even some of the law's secondary effects will
be significant. Its electrical bill, for example, would
surely be inflated by the acid-rain provisions. Du Pont,
which consumes about 0.5% of all the electricity generated in
the U.S., isn't offering estimates anymore. But while
studying somewhat-tougher legislative proposals two years
ago, it calculated that its annual bill would soar by as much
as $40 million.
   And because the law will provide for the gradual
introduction of pollution-control measures -- many still
unspecified -- extending into the next century, it will
preoccupy Du Pont for years. Many executives now running the
company may well be retired before its full effect is
understood.
   Yet for all the hustling the company will have to do, the
law isn't going to make or break it. "It's very clear that Du
Pont has anticipated a good deal of what's in the Clean Air
Act," says Paul Kleindorfer, a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School who studies pollution-control
issues.
   After years of fighting off new clean-air rules, Du Pont
has accepted their political inevitability, even though it
still insists that acid rain isn't a crisis and that its
chemical plants aren't poisoning their neighbors. Edgar
Woolard, who became Du Pont's chief executive last year, has
been preaching within the company that its plants will
continue to operate only at the pleasure of the public.
   Contrary to dire warnings from industry trade groups, Du
Pont doesn't believe that the legislation will inflict huge
job losses or cost consumers and businesses up to five times
the government's estimate. The company even anticipates
making some financial gains. It expects, for instance, to
expand its own budding environmental-services businesses
tenfold during the 1990s, to annual sales of $1 billion.
   Indeed, the new law is likely to create winners and losers
within Du Pont.
                                                                                                       

   Chemicals
                                                                                                       

   Du Pont, the largest U.S. chemical company, has at least
five production lines that could come under scrutiny if the
law includes a Senate provision that threatens to shut down
plants emitting high levels of toxic or cancer-causing fumes.
Production lines at three Du Pont plants in Texas and one in
Louisiana showed up this year on a controversial list in an
Environmental Protection Agency study of cancer risks
attributed to manufacturing.
   The Senate bill could halt production unless the neighbors
of industrial plants face no more than a one-in-10,000 risk
of getting cancer from emissions. A different approach by the
House, which Du Pont favors, calls instead for a
still-unspecified margin of safety. Risk assessment being an
imperfect science, the law will provide for further studies,
and the outcome could be years off. Yet the chemical industry
is already fighting the shutdown prospect especially hard.
   An example of how the issue affects Du Pont can be found
at its sprawling Beaumont Works, along the Neches River in
east-central Texas. The plant appeared on the EPA list
because it emits carbon tetrachloride, a solvent used to
produce Hypalon synthetic rubber. The Hypalon line accounts
for about 100 of the plant's 1,000 jobs and supplies rubber
for use in roofing, pond liners and auto parts.
   The Beaumont Works already uses a state-of-the-art carbon
filter to catch the emissions, according to Jeffrey Greif, an
engineering specialist at the Texas Air Control Board. And
two years ago, the plant began to recycle carbon
tetrachloride from the filter more often, cutting the chance
that the gas would escape. What more could Du Pont do to
control the fumes? "I don't think they could do a lot more
without making it extremely expensive," Mr. Greif says.
   If the regulatory pressure on the Beaumont Works grows, Du
Pont will no doubt try to prove the EPA's initial risk
assessment wrong. Already, an industrial group including Du
Pont is trying to make the first actual measurements of
emissions outside the plant. By contrast, the EPA relied on
calculations that ignored conditions specific to that plant.
One condition that would favor the Beaumont Works: The
prevailing winds tend to blow fumes away from residences and
toward a swamp.
   A broader, more immediate task for Du Pont stems from
provisions in both the House and Senate bills requiring that
every production line nationwide install the best
pollution-control technology available. The EPA hopes that
toxic fumes, blamed for at least 2,700 cancer deaths a year
and other health hazards, will be cut 90%.
   The tricky part for Du Pont is that it has already begun
its own effort to cut total emissions 60% from 1987 levels by
1993, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. By
continuing along its own route, the company may yet exempt
certain plants from adopting EPA-specified controls if
emission reductions are deep enough. But at other plants, it
runs the risk of installing new equipment only to find later
that the EPA requires something else.
   "Do we want to proceed" with current plans? asks Du Pont
engineer William Walsh, noting the dilemma. "Or do we want to
fall back" until the EPA regulations are clear?
                                                                                                       

   Coal
                                                                                                       

   No Du Pont unit is stung harder by clean-air legislation
than Pittsburgh-based Consol, one of the two biggest
high-sulfur coal producers in the U.S.
   Acid-rain provisions will hurt demand for high-sulfur
coal, which makes up 60% of Consol's production. Consol
Executive Vice President William Karis sees "a high
probability that some part" of 10% of its total output --
representing $40 million to $50 million in annual revenue --
will be lost as utilities switch to cleaner-burning
low-sulfur coal to reduce emissions. Up to 1,500 coal miners
throughout the company could lose their jobs.
   Consol hopes to make up its revenue losses by selling more
low-sulfur coal. But job losses seem inevitable, especially
along the Ohio between Moundsville, W.Va., and Clarington,
Ohio. Acid-rain controls may force one or perhaps as many as
three of the company's four high-sulfur mines there to close,
starting in 1995. "This is the bull's eye as far as acid-rain
legislation is concerned," Mr. Karis says.
   What happens depends on how two area power plants that
burn local coal from Consol's mines decide to cut their
sulfur-dioxide emissions. They can either install expensive
scrubbing equipment that lets them burn local coal more
cleanly or switch to low-sulfur coal from elsewhere.
   The prospects aren't good. Ohio Power Co. currently thinks
its Kammer power plant can't be economically retrofitted with
a scrubber and will have to switch fuels. Ohio Electric
Valley Corp. says the chances are 50-50 that its Kyger Creek
plant also will switch.
   Consol's problems would hurt the community, which has
steadily lost mining and industrial jobs. "There's a point
where people's lives and jobs are much more important than
what's going up into the air," comments John R. Yanen, who
runs the Ford dealership in Moundsville.
   In Pittsburgh, Consol executives are planning how to react
to the legislation. Mr. Karis says the company is acquiring
more low-sulfur reserves and plans to double the pace at
which it develops new low-sulfur mines, at a significant
capital investment.
   "I could make an argument that on balance we should do as
well or maybe even better under an acid-rain bill," Mr. Karis
says. But "as it stands today," says Rafael Villagran, an
energy analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, "Consol is major
loser." It has been slow in acquiring low-sulfur reserves,
analysts say. They add that while companies with large
low-sulfur reserves may grow as much as 30%, Consol will have
a hard time just staying even. However, the company has the
ability "to pull this off if anybody can to make this thing a
wash," Mr. Villagran says.
                                                                                                       

   CFCs
                                                                                                       

   Du Pont, which supplies half the chlorofluorocarbons in
the U.S., pledged in 1988 to stop making CFCs by the year
2000, the date now set in the House and Senate bills. But the
bills also set phaseout deadlines for so-called HCFCs, the
chemicals on which the company is relying most heavily as CFC
substitutes.
   So, Du Pont has to rethink where to put the $1 billion it
had planned to spend world-wide on substitutes by the end of
the decade. Though working on various substitutes, the
company still favors HCFCs because they retain many of the
operating characteristics of CFCs but only 2% to 10% of their
ozone-depleting capacity. Yet it maintains that its customers
-- makers of refrigerators, for example -- will be loath to
switch to HCFCs if soon afterward they have to switch -- and,
for some refrigerants, redesign equipment -- again.
   "If our customers don't want the compound, there's no
reason for us to make it," says Tony Vogelsberg,
environmental manager in Du Pont's CFC business.
   Some environmental groups say that Du Pont can still
recoup its investment and that only tight limits on HCFCs
will spur industry to seek still-better options. "The
deadline on HCFCs must be soon enough to keep the engine of
innovation running," David Doniger, an attorney for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, told a congressional
committee earlier this year. The current bills would freeze
production of most HCFCs in 2015 and ban nearly all
production in 2030; both dates are more than a decade earlier
than Du Pont had favored.
   Mr. Vogelsberg declines to say how Du Pont may change its
spending plans. Even before Congress started debating the new
law, however, Du Pont was hedging its bets. Its first new
commercial-size HCFC plant to serve the U.S., now under
construction in Ontario, is designed to make only modest
amounts of the chemical initially -- in case a market never
develops.
                                                                                                       

   Gasoline
                                                                                                       

   A few months after President Bush unveiled his clean-air
proposal with a mandate for fuels cleaner than today's
gasoline, researchers at Conoco's lab at its Ponca City,
Okla., refinery were reassigned to a new project:
reformulated gasoline. Chemical specialists at other Du Pont
labs also were told to study cleaner-burning auto fuels.
   Conoco does little business in the nine smoggiest U.S.
cities where a cleaner gasoline would be required under the
congressional proposals. But officials of the Houston-based
company expect demand for a cleaner gas to spread. So, it
already is exploring what will be needed to reconfigure its
four U.S. refineries to produce a new fuel.
   Another oil company, Amoco Corp., estimates that it would
cost the entire industry $20 billion in capital costs to
reconfigure the 188 U.S. refineries to produce a new fuel.
David Rossiter, Conoco's energypolicy manager, declines to
estimate the expense to Conoco but says "it's not one we're
going to go out of business on."
   Like much of the oil industry, Conoco has big problems
with attempts by both the House and Senate to write a
specific formula for a new gasoline; the industry is expected
to lobby for changes before the bill goes to the president.
Nevertheless, Mr. Rossiter says Conoco sees "multiple
business opportunities" ahead because of clean-air
requirements, not just for a new fuel at the pumps but in
specialty products such as additives and lubricants. "We have
plenty of incentive to be right on top of this," he says.

   THE PLIGHT OF AFRICA

   Africans lead shorter lives and have the worst
infant-mortality and literacy rates of all developing
regions, according to a new study by the United Nations
Development Program.
   The study rated personal well-being in 130 countries based
on a formula combining life expectancy, adult literacy and
per-capita income. Of the 44 countries the study listed as
having low "human development," 33 are in Africa. The African
nation with the highest rating was Mauritius, ranked No. 49.
   Africa's per-capita income fell by a quarter in the 1980s,
the report said. It predicted that nearly 400 million
Africans will be living in extreme poverty by 1995, up from
250 million in 1985.
   The study also found that some of the world's poorer
countries such as Sri Lanka and Costa Rica have a higher
quality of life than wealthier ones such as Brazil because
they put the poor ahead of the middle class or the military.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN-OHIO AGREEMENT
                                                                                                       

   Japan agreed to send trade experts to Ohio to promote
imports from that state. Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste signed
the agreement with an official of the Japan External Trade
Organization, which has decided that the state-based approach
is Japan's best bet for reducing its $49 billion trade
surplus with the U.S. Under the agreement, the Japanese
representatives will be sent to Ohio for one-year stays to
advise government trade officials and companies that want to
export to Japan. The trade organization has already signed a
similar agreement with Indiana.
                                                                                                       

   ROME AIR-TRAFFIC DISRUPTION

   Air-traffic controllers at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci
airport announced strikes for tomorrow and Sunday and from
June 4 through June 6. The strikes are expected to seriously
hamper flight schedules in other Italian airports. Tens of
thousands of fans will be arriving in Italy over the next two
weeks to attend matches of the month-long World Cup soccer
competition, which begins June 8. The controllers are
protesting what they call unfair working conditions.
                                                                                                       

   INVESTING IN THE PHILIPPINES
                                                                                                       

   Foreign investment in the Philippines reached $47.9
million in the first quarter of the year, up 62.5% from $29.5
million in the like period a year earlier, the Central Bank
of the Philippines reported. Britain topped the list of
foreign investors during the quarter with $14.8 million, or
30.8% of the total, followed by the U.S., with $12.7 million,
and Japan, with $7.8 million.
                                                                                                       

   A MADRID PLAN FAILS
                                                                                                       

   Motorists in traffic-congested Madrid ignored calls for a
"Day Without Cars" yesterday, snarling the Spanish capital
with traffic jams as usual. Police said traffic decreased by
only 3%. Extra commuter trains remained idle, and the number
of passengers on subway services did not increase. Madrid's
commuters have been urged by Mayor Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun
to use public transport on weekdays and save cars for
weekends.
                                                                                                       

   `GODDESS' PROJECT ENDS
                                                                                                       

   Organizers of the radio ship Goddess of Democracy, which
planned to broadcast pro-democracy messages to China, are
abandoning their mission. Pascal Dupont, an organizer of the
mission, was scheduled to announce the termination of the
project at a Tokyo news conference today, the Foreign
Correspondents' Club of Japan said in a press release. "The
ship, still in Taiwan, has been turned away from Hong Kong,
made unwelcome in Taiwan and told by the Japanese it would
not be welcomed. . . . In the face of this opposition, the
organizers have decided to give it up," the release said.
                                                                                                       

   U.N. REFUGEE AGENCY IS BROKE
                                                                                                       

   The Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, a United
Nations agency that depends on voluntary contributions from
governments, said its financial situation is so desperate
that it could "result in unacceptable suffering and could
even take its toll in terms of human lives."
   The agency said it needed $80 million to make ends meet
this year. Staffers said the agency cannot afford to buy food
or blankets for 800,000 Mozambicans who have fled civil
strife into neighboring Malawi. Officials point out that the
agency, which was set up in 1951 to deal with one million
displaced people in Europe, now cares for 15 million on five
continents.
   The agency's 43-nation Executive Committee has recommended
that the agency limit the scope of its operations to the
survival of refugees -- food, water and housing -- and leave
the education and self-help programs that have proliferated
over the years to other specialized bodies.
   In Japan, the Foreign Ministry said 427 Chinese boat
people who disguised themselves as Vietnamese refugees to
seek jobs will be sent home today.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Most West Germans favor slowing down German unification,
according to a poll published in Stern magazine. Though most
support eventual union, many fear haste will jeopardize their
affluence, since East Germany will be heavily reliant on West
German financial aid. . . . Commenting on the plans of a
Hungarian businessman to turn Budapest into the Bangkok of
Eastern Europe, replete with brothels and "sex boats,"
Interior Minister Balazs Horvath said prohibiting the scheme
would be useless, "but we hope very much to create a society
in which there is no demand for such services."

   Paying a Premium
   For Service Contracts

   SOME AUTO DEALERS are taking car buyers for a ride by
charging inflated prices on extended warranties.
   So says the New York attorney general's office, which
gathered pricing information from four auto makers -- Ford
Motor Co., General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. and Toyota
Motor Corp. -- and from New York car dealerships. The office
concluded that dealers overcharged half of New York customers
who bought service contracts in 1989, or about 175,000 car
buyers.
   The attorney general's office defined overcharging as any
prices higher than manufacturers' suggested retail prices,
which include sizable profits for dealers. Where there wasn't
a suggested price, any price more than double the dealer's
cost was considered overcharging.
   In one case, the attorney general's office says, a New
York Chrysler dealer charged a customer $1,620 for a service
contract that had a suggested retail price of $250, and a
wholesale price to the dealer of $125.
   Based on its findings in New York, the attorney general's
office estimates that consumers nationwide paid $300 million
more than they should have in 1989 for such policies. A
spokeswoman for the National Automobile Dealers Association
says, "We are aware of the findings but have no comment at
this time."
   Extended warranties may not be worth the trouble anyway.
"Service contracts can be real moneymakers for the provider
{but} very troublesome for consumers," says a spokeswoman for
Consumer Reports magazine. She suggests simply buying a car
with a track record of reliability.
                                                                                                       

   Marketing to Women
   May Be No Different
                                                                                                       

   DON'T WE all want the same thing? A woman auto executive
says yes and declares "women's marketing" to be nonsense.
   For years, auto makers have talked up marketing to women
and spent big money on several programs aimed directly at
female buyers. The reason: Women buy lots of cars and
influence purchases they don't actually make. Last year, 47%
of all cars and 20% of trucks were sold to women, says a Ford
spokesman, who adds that growing female purchasing power is
bringing women's marketing "to a high point in the industry."
   But Laurel Cutler, Chrysler's vice president, consumer
affairs, and vice chairman of New York ad agency FCB/Leber
Katz Partners, says advertising aimed solely at women is
"patronizing and condescending." Ms. Cutler says women, like
men, want their cars to deliver quality, reliability,
enjoyment and style. She says Chrysler and other auto makers
should dismantle their women's marketing committees.
   A Ford spokesman, however, says its women's advisory
committee brought the company such recommendations as car
door handles that can be opened with minimum breakage to
women's fingernails. "There is a value to a women's marketing
committee," the spokesman says. "It comes up with concrete
things that are really worthwhile."
                                                                                                       

   Things That Go Bump
   Can Be a Nightmare
                                                                                                       

   CAR BUMPERS may not be the same even on vehicles that are
alike in virtually every other way.
   Toyota's Corolla DX, made in Japan and exported to the
U.S., sustained no damage when its front bumper hit a barrier
at five miles per hour in a test by the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety. But the car's U.S.-made twin, GM's Geo
Prizm, sustained $267 of damage in the same test. "There are
some differences in {the supporting} brackets that may have
accounted for the difference in performance," a GM
spokeswoman says.
   Overall, the institute says, bumpers did "a poor job of
preventing damage, and some were downright lousy." It
recently conducted a series of four five-mph crash tests at
different angles on 16 small, four-door 1990 cars. All
sustained extensive -- and expensive -- damage in the tests.
   The best-performing bumpers of the group were on Honda
Motor Co.'s Civic DX, which had $769 in damage. The Civic's
front bumper came out unscathed in a head-on barrier
collision, and the car suffered moderate damage in three
other tests. The worst performer was Daihatsu Motor Co.'s
Charade SE, with $3,838 in damage.
   The institute blames weakened federal requirements and
failure to supply consumers with bumper performance
information. In the early 1980s, new cars had to withstand
front and rear crash tests at five mph with minimal damage to
the bumpers. But for 1983 and later models, the
Transportation Department switched to 2 1/2-mph crash tests
and allowed more substantial bumper damage. "The result is
unnecessary damage in fender-bender crashes," says Brian
O'Neill, institute president.
                                                                                                       

   Price of Replacing
   Air Bags Is Dropping
                                                                                                       

   THE COST of replacing a deployed air bag depends on the
car.
   Ford says repairs average $475 for its driver-side air
bags and $575 for passenger-side bags. But at Mercedes-Benz
of North America Inc., those costs average $950 and about
$1,500, respectively. Chrysler's average cost is $300 for a
driver-side bag; the company doesn't yet offer one on the
passenger side. Nor does General Motors, which suggests
replacing the total air-bag system, rather than just the bag,
at an average price of $945.
   The good news for drivers: Insurance companies generally
pay to replace bags. And as air bags become more common, the
cost of replacing them is falling. Ford's charges have
dropped by more than $100 in the past year.

   Navy Reopens Inquiry of USS Iowa Blast
   After Gun Powder Ignites During Test

   WASHINGTON -- Bags of powder from 16-inch Navy guns
ignited in a test yesterday, blowing a hole in the service's
explanation for last year's fatal gun-turret explosion aboard
the battleship Iowa.
   Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett ordered an immediate halt
to firing of the large-diameter guns on all four of the
Navy's World War II-vintage battleships and reopened the
search for the cause of the April 1989 Iowa explosion, which
killed 47 sailors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Navy originally concluded that the cause of the Iowa
explosion "most probably" was an intentional act by one of
the ship's enlisted men, Clayton Hartwig, who died in the
explosion. Lawmakers weren't satisfied with that explanation,
however, and insisted on further tests.
   At those tests yesterday, Secretary Garrett said in a
brief statement, there was an "unexplained ignition" of bags
of powder used to fire such guns.
   Pentagon officials said yesterday's "follow-up" tests were
intended to evaluate a theory, developed by scientists and
engineers at the Energy Department's Sandia Laboratory, that
friction inside the gun could have sparked the Iowa explosion
and the resulting intense fire. According to these officials,
the tests simulated the force of ramming five fully loaded
bags of powder into the firing mechanism of the battleship's
gun with more force than Navy procedures call for.
   Officials said the first 17 simulated loadings didn't
create any explosion, but all of the powder bags exploded
during the 18th test.
   The Navy's embarrassing reversal came just one day before
officials from Sandia and the General Accounting Office are
scheduled to challenge some of the service's basic
conclusions about the accident in testimony before the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
   Mr. Garrett and Navy brass apparently hope to deflect some
of that criticism by quickly ordering a further investigation
of their own. But Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), one of
the strongest critics of the Navy's Iowa probe, said in an
interview that the Navy waited too long to reopen the probe.
   "It's long overdue for them to admit their mistake . . .
and acknowledge that they had absolutely no credible
evidence" to support the theory that Mr. Hartwig purposely
caused the explosion, the Ohio lawmaker said. "It's obvious
that they know what's coming in the GAO report."
   Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, who was in charge of the
initial investigation, has maintained that months of
laboratory tests uncovered "unique foreign material" on the
projectile that was in the Iowa's gun barrel at the time of
the accident, indicating that the explosion was caused by
some kind of detonator rather than by unstable powder or
improper handling of the charge by the ship's crew.
   Scientists at Sandia, however, recently told Pentagon
officials and lawmakers that the laboratory's series of test
firings showed that friction from improper handling could
have been enough to ignite the powder used in the
battleships' guns.

   Environment:
   Package Firms
   Find It's Hard
   Being `Green'

   It's easy to talk about the environment. But as
competition grows in the consumer-packaging industry to bring
environmentally correct bottles and cartons to market, many
companies are finding that it's no snap to develop packaging
that both protects the environment and sells.
   Consider the experience of privately owned Drug Plastics &amp;
Glass Co. The little Boyertown, Pa., maker of pill bottles,
envisioning a vast consumer market, recently set out to
introduce its Recyclepak, a plastic bottle made with
one-third recycled plastic.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   First, the company had to adapt manufacturing equipment to
extrude three different resins simultaneously, including a
middle layer made from recycled plastic. Now Fred N.
Biesecker, chairman and president, is sweating out two months
of field marketing trials that will determine whether
Recyclepak is as durable and versatile as bottles made from
all-new plastic, which can hold everything from hand cream to
pesticides.
   Even if the bottle, as expected, passes muster, Mr.
Biesecker must still worry about the quality of the recycled
plastic he's buying. Many users of recycled materials
complain that curbside collection programs often offer
contaminated loads because plastic, glass and aluminum have
been mixed up in one bag and haven't been cleaned.
   "I'm taking a very big gamble," the 50-year-old Mr.
Biesecker says. But he quickly adds: "This baby is going to
work. It's part of the solution" to the solid-waste crisis.
   Some industry specialists agree. Arthur D. Little Inc.
forecasts that the market for packaging made at least partly
from recycled material will total $500 million by as early as
the mid-1990s.
   To cash in on this market, it helps to have a link to a
big consumer-products company such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co. or
General Mills Inc. P&amp;G says it guided its packaging suppliers
in the development of plastic bottles containing recycled
plastic for Tide and Cheer laundry detergents and other P&amp;G
products. General Mills says it pushed its paperboard
packaging suppliers to the point where, today, 98% of the
cartons it uses for cereals and other dry food are made of
recycled paperboard.
   In these cases, however, the packaging companies' problems
get transferred to the consumer-products makers. For example,
after P&amp;G, in 1988, told its packaging suppliers to
incorporate recycled plastic, it conducted extensive tests to
ensure product integrity. It further has set out to ensure a
steady supply of uncontaminated recyclable plastic. Thus, P&amp;G
is now working with several cities and companies on
developing new plastic recycling programs and reprocessing
centers.
   Many small packaging companies are struggling just to
create a market. Korrus New Jersey hopes a new packaging
material it makes called Korrvu will replace polystyrene
"bubblepacks" and plastic foam "peanuts" that have long
encased products during shipment.
   Korrvu is a thin, tough, flexible plastic film glued to a
cardboard frame that fits snugly inside a corrugated shipping
container. The plastic takes the shape of the product,
effectively immobilizing the contents during shipment.
   Although Korrvu uses much less plastic than plastic foam
peanuts, Elliott R. Beneroff, Korrus's vice president, says
the company set out to enhance its environmental credentials.
First, it persuaded Korrvu's inventor to add corn starch to
the plastic, thus making it biodegradable. Given recent
criticism of claims for biodegradable products, Korrus then
found a professor in Rutgers University's biochemistry and
microbiology department who tested and confirmed Korrvu's
biodegradability.
   All this, however, only got Korrvu to the starting line.
Next, says Mr. Beneroff, the company searched for a machine
that could affix the plastic film securely to the cardboard
frame. Finding none, Korrus induced a German company to adapt
a similar machine. Even with Korrvu's environmental
friendliness, however, Korrvu has yet to catch on.
   At International Paper Co., Robert Gordon, principal
packaging designer, has high hopes for a product that he says
nearly caused him to pull out his hair over the 3 1/2 years
it took to perfect.
   It's called the "spout package," a basic cardboard juice
carton with a twist -- specifically, a plastic screw cap on
the carton's gabled top. The package, similar to one Procter
&amp; Gamble has in test markets for its Citrus Hill orange
juice, was initially developed for convenience. But focus
groups with consumers early on convinced International Paper
that people perceived it to be better for the environment
than an all-plastic or even glass or tin container, because
it could be recycled more easily. So Mr. Gordon went to work.
   First, he had to lick pourability problems: Some
experimental spouts tended to drip, others to clog. Next, he
developed a form of sonic sealing to affix the spout to the
package because traditional heat sealing wasn't fast enough
to meet the company's manufacturing goal of 70 to 90 packages
a minute. Then the company looked for a plastics molder to
make the top; it rejected 18, mostly for quality problems,
before settling on one. Finally, International Paper had to
help develop machinery for its customers so they could modify
their own packaging equipment to make spout packages.
   In this case, at least, the reward seems at hand. Mr.
Gordon says that given International Paper's big share of the
juice-carton market, anywhere from 50 million to 100 million
spout packages could turn up on supermarket shelves over the
next several months.

   TOKYO -- Japan's long-term prime rate is likely to drop
0.3 percentage point to 7.6%, according to an official at one
of the long-term credit banks.
   The decision by the three long-term credit banks, which
reset their benchmark lending rate at the end of each month,
is expected Friday afternoon, the official said. The rate is
set 90 basis points above the coupon rate of the new monthly
issues of five-year debentures of the banks. The three
institutions are Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank.

   Economy:
   GNP Growth
   Estimate Is Cut
   For 1st Quarter

   Latest Government Report
   Says the Economy Rose
   At Annual Rate of 1.3%

   WASHINGTON -- The government scaled down its estimate of
the economy's growth in the first quarter to a 1.3% annual
rate, barely faster than the fourth quarter's limp pace.
   New information showed that business inventories,
particularly stocks of auto dealers, were considerably
slimmer during the three months than the government initially
believed. That led the Commerce Department to reduce its
estimate of the increase in the nation's real gross national
product -- the inflation-adjusted value of all the goods and
services produced -- from the 2.1% rate it calculated in an
advance report released last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On the surface, the numbers suggest a shift to economic
anemia from slow but healthy growth. But because the downward
revision centered on business inventories, many analysts said
the picture wasn't quite that dark. In fact, many economists
believe a reduction in inventories is healthy during a time
of slow growth because it keeps stocks in line with softening
demand and diminishes the possibility of drastic cuts in
production.
   "The economy is just as strong as in the advance report,"
said Kermit Baker, director of economics at Cahners
Publishing in Newton, Mass., which puts out business
publications. "What it means fundamentally is manufacturers
weren't expecting as much strength and didn't produce as
much. When demand came in stronger, they took it out of
inventories."
   Real final sales, a gauge of demand in the economy, grew
4.1% in the first quarter, a quick pace and a shade stronger
than the initial estimate of 4%. That was much better than
the 1.1% gain in the fourth quarter.
   The department said after-tax corporate profits edged up
0.2% in the first quarter, to an annual rate of $157 billion.
That was a sharp slowdown from the 2.8% increase in the
fourth quarter but it was still better than the first three
quarters of 1989, when profits fell. The department will
revise its profits statistics next month when it makes a
third estimate of GNP.
   Even though the downward revision in first-quarter GNP
meant the economy barely improved from its meek 1.1% rate of
growth in the fourth quarter, the report showed personal
consumption, trade and fixed investment were all higher than
in the final three months of 1989.
   Although many economists -- as well as the financial
markets -- seemed to dismiss the revision because of its
concentration in inventories, Joseph Carson, senior economist
at Chemical Bank in New York argued, "To put all attention on
inventories is to ignore some fundamental deficiencies in the
economy."
   He, like many other economists, believes much of the
economy's expansion in the first quarter was helped by
temporary occurrences: mild weather contributed to a spurt in
construction, and the conclusion of a strike at Boeing Co. in
the fourth quarter resulted in a burst of aircraft production
in the first quarter. "So I think apart from those special
factors, growth in the first quarter was close to zero," Mr.
Carson said.
   Mr. Carson also noted that much of the reduction in
inventories was in the auto industry, which closed plants and
laid off thousands of workers during the first quarter to
trim bulging stocks.
   The department did push up its calculation of inflation in
the first quarter a bit. Its fixed weighted price index,
which measures the change in price of a fixed array of goods
and services in the GNP, grew at a 6.7% annual rate in the
first quarter instead of 6.5%, the new report said.
   That jump, following a 3.6% rate in the fourth quarter,
was the biggest since the fourth quarter of 1981. But most
analysts think the spike in prices was largely temporary,
driven by a jump in food and energy prices after a bitter
cold spell during the winter.
   The department didn't change its estimate of another price
gauge, the implicit price deflator, which reflects the change
in the mix of goods and services in the GNP. Prices by this
measure rose at a 5.7% annual rate, the steepest increase
since the third quarter of 1982.
   Also according to yesterday's report, profits from current
production rose 0.7% in the first quarter to a $287.8 billion
rate, after tumbling 3.2% in the fourth quarter. Net
corporate cash flow decreased 2.3% in the first quarter to a
$389.3 billion rate, compared with a 0.3% decline in the
fourth quarter.

   AUSTIN, Texas -- Boosted by unusually strong overseas
sales growth, Dell Computer Corp. said it had record revenue
and net income in its May 4 first quarter.
   Net income more than doubled to $5.3 million, or 28 cents
a share, from the year-earlier level of $2.1 million, or 11
cents a share. Revenue increased 38%, to $120.3 million from
$87.5 million a year earlier, reflecting the highest
quarterly sales in the computer maker's history.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dell's earnings "exceeded our expectations," said Michael
Dell, chairman and chief executive. They also marked a sharp
turnaround from the past several quarters, when the company
was working off a surplus of high-cost inventory that
severely pinched its margins and reduced earnings to as low
as one cent a share.
   While domestic revenue was up 15% from a year ago, most of
Dell's gains were made overseas, where sales more than
doubled from last year's first quarter. International sales
now represent 36% of Dell's world-wide revenue, said Mr.
Dell, compared with 23% a year ago. Dell has international
subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Canada, West Germany,
France and Sweden.
   But Mr. Dell cautioned that the current quarter will not
show the same growth rate, partly because much of the
first-quarter international sales gain was caused by year-end
government orders.
   And while Dell's domestic business is "holding its own,"
Mr. Dell added, margin pressures are increasing as
competitors try to increase market share through
more-aggressive pricing.

   ROME -- Italy's balance of payments surplus rose
marginally to 2.232 trillion lire ($1.81 billion) in April
from the 2.202 trillion lira surplus recorded a year earlier,
the Bank of Italy said.
   The April surplus was sharply lower, however, than the
4.190 trillion lira surplus reported in March.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The central bank also reported that the balance of
payments showed a surplus of 8.184 trillion lire in the first
four months of 1990, compared with a surplus of 9.188
trillion lire in the year-earlier period.
   The central bank said the balance of payments surplus was
the result of a net capital outflow through the banking
system of 1.148 trillion lire as well as inflows totaling
6.899 trillion lire in the form of international investments
and loans.
   All figures are provisional and aren't seasonally

   SYDNEY -- Australia's current-account deficit is expected
to have narrowed in April from March, but economists say that
is due to fewer business days in April rather than to a
contraction in average daily imports.
   The current-account deficit for April is scheduled to be
announced Monday.

<TEXT>
   An AP-Dow Jones survey of 20 economists shows they expect,
on average, a current-account deficit of 1.2 billion
Australian dollars (US$919.6 million) before seasonal
adjustment, narrowing from deficits of A$1.8 billion in March
and A$1.3 billion in April 1989. Forecasts range from A$800
million to A$1.4 billion.

   LONDON -- New U.K. economic data showed a continued rise
in industrial production against a background of steady wage
increases in manufacturing, reinforcing economists' views
that the Thatcher government is having mixed success in
cooling the economy.
   The Central Statistical Office reported industrial
production rose 1.8% in March from month-earlier levels,
while rising 1.7% from March 1989. In addition, unit wage
costs in the manufacturing sector, while easing 0.3% in March
from February, were up 7.5% from the year-earlier month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The data come on top of a wider-than-expected April
merchandise trade deficit of 1.78 billion pounds ($3.01
billion), reported Wednesday.
   "One month ago, we had tentative signs" of a slowdown in
economic activity that could lead to lower inflation, says
David Owen, economist at Kleinwort Benson Securities. Now, he
says, that optimism appears to have been misplaced.
   A Treasury official noted that the year-on-year rise in
industrial production showed that the "rate of growth has
clearly slowed over the past year," as expected in the
current fiscal climate.
   But the market was anticipating a rise in industrial
production of only about 0.45%. The higher-than-expected rise
led many economists to revise next week's first-quarter
output-based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures upward to
stand even with quarter-earlier levels or to show a modest
gain.
   GDP in the fourth quarter was up 2% -- from a year
earlier. Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major has forecast
that GDP growth would be 1% for 1990.
   Although unit wage costs in the manufacturing sector
showed a modest fall in March, UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew Ltd.
economist Joe Roseman notes that wage settlements are still
running at an "uncomfortably high level" on an annualized
basis, putting considerable pressure on profit margins.
   The squeeze on profits has led to some employment
contraction in the manufacturing sector, which economists say
may shortly lead to lower wage demands. But they add that
this has yet to be felt in the service sector, where the wage
problem is exacerbated by an acute shortage of skilled labor.
   Mr. Roseman and other economists take comfort from the
historical pattern of high wage settlements of the early
1980s and early 1986, which were followed by sharp falls in
pay settlements. But these also suggest that any sudden
shakeouts in the labor market can't be expected in 1990.

   LONDON -- In a sudden change of corporate strategy,
Britain's Thorn EMI PLC said it is discussing selling its big
European light bulb and light fixture business to GTE Corp.
of the U.S.
   Such a transaction, valued by London analysts at roughly
350 million pounds ($592.7 million), would expand Stamford,
Conn.-based GTE's European lighting business and strengthen
its standing in the increasingly fierce world lighting
market. The Thorn business is the world's fifth biggest
light-bulb maker, and claims to tie N.V. Philips of the
Netherlands as the largest manufacture of fixtures. GTE ranks
third in making light bulbs, but is a smaller player in
fixtures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For Thorn, the move to sell what the company had
previously called a "core" business puzzled many London
financial analysts. Since 1985, when plunging profits and a
boardroom coup brought Chairman Colin Southgate to power, the
company has been in a near-constant state of reorganization.
It has shed a movie-making division and a semiconductor unit,
and has been trying to sell its defense-electronics division.
If lighting goes -- Thorn's original business at its 1928
founding -- two main divisions will remain: renting household
appliances, and publishing and recording music.
   A Thorn spokeswoman said the lighting-business talks were
necessitated by harsher market conditions. In the past few
years the world lighting industry has been consolidating,
with bigger companies buying smaller ones or forming
alliances. The Thorn business "wasn't of a sufficient size to
compete on an independent basis," she said. Also, according
to London-based analyst Ron Littleboy of Nomura Research
Institute, the Thorn lighting business's operating profit
slipped to about 36 million pounds in the year ended March
31, from 40 million pounds a year earlier. A Thorn spokesman
declined to comment on Mr. Littleboy's estimate.
   Neither Thorn nor GTE was willing to discuss the possible
sales terms. "Where'd they get that number?" responded Dean
Langford, president of GTE's Electrical Products Group, when
asked about London analysts' estimates of a possible 350
million-pound price tag. "It's a bit premature to say what
the price is going to be when we're just beginning
negotiations," he added.
   GTE and Thorn have already been partners for some time.
The two companies have a joint Italian light-bulb venture.
Mr. Langford said that combining with Thorn's business would
make GTE a "strong number two" in the world-wide lighting
business after Philips -- though it wasn't possible to
confirm that assessment independently. Mr. Langford said the
transaction would strengthen GTE in Italy, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Scandinavia and Australia.

   SOUTH WINDSOR, Conn. -- Gerber Scientific Inc. said it
named a new president to its Gerber Scientific Products Inc.
subsidiary, and formed a new wholly owned subsidiary to focus
on the eyewear industry.
   The factory-automation concern also reported an 8.3%
profit drop for its fourth quarter ended April 30, and a 1.3%
profit drop for the year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gerber said Ronald Webster, a 30-year company veteran,
will replace David Logan as president of GSP, which makes
automation systems for the sign-making, graphic arts and
related industries.
   Mr. Logan, who joined Gerber in 1957 and founded GSP in
1980, has decided to retire, the company said. He will
continue to serve as a director and consultant to GSP and
Gerber Optical Inc., the new Gerber subsidiary.
   The company named Kenneth Wood, former head of Gerber's
optical division, as president of Gerber Optical. The
subsidiary, which aims to automate eyewear makers, was formed
from Mr. Wood's old division.
   In the fourth quarter, Gerber said it had a 1.3% gain in
sales, to $80.9 million from $79.9 million in the year-ago
period. But profit slipped to $8.3 million, or 35 cents a
share, from $9.1 million, or 38 cents a share on a greater
number of shares outstanding.
   For the fiscal year, Gerber posted a 2.6% sales gain, to
$307.2 million from $299.3 million in 1989. Profit fell
slightly, to $32.4 million from $32.9 million, but pershare
earnings rose one cent to $1.36 because of a 1.9% drop in
average shares outstanding.

   Makers and Sellers of Toxic Chemicals
   Face Environmental-Cleanup Liability

   Manufacturers and distributors of toxic chemicals may face
liability for environmental cleanups, even in cases in which
they weren't responsible for any accident or spill.
   Preliminary rulings in a handful of cases suggest that
courts may be heading toward the conclusion that, with
cleanup costs skyrocketing, the burden must be shared more
broadly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the federal Superfund law, companies that generate,
transport, store or dispose of hazardous waste are liable for
its cleanup. Chemical suppliers, who played no role beyond
manufacture or sale of their products, had assumed until
recently that they could escape such liability. Their main
legal concern was defending against suits by people who
claimed they or their property were damaged by exposure to
the products.
   The potential for environmental liability increases their
legal risk significantly. "The costs of cleaning up hazardous
waste are much higher than a generous personal-injury award,"
says Joel Schneider, a defense lawyer with the Philadelphia
law firm of Manta &amp; Welge, who has written about the trend.
   So far, most courts have required that a supplier can't be
held liable unless it played at least an indirect role in
disposal of the product. But if the supplier sells its
product to a waste-site owner, courts have assessed liability
against the supplier under the assumption that the supplier
was arranging for the product's disposal.
   Last year, a federal appeals court in St. Louis refused to
dismiss a suit filed by the Environmental Protection Agency
against eight manufacturers that did business with Aidex
Corp., a defunct Mills County, Iowa, pesticide formulator.
The eight companies hired Aidex to mix and package their
chemicals into finished pesticide products. The agency sought
to recover more than $10 million it had spent cleaning up
toxic waste at the processing site.
   EPA acknowledged that the companies, including Aceto
Agricultural Chemicals Corp. and Dow Chemical Co., hadn't
actually created or disposed of the waste. But the agency
argued that the companies should still pay for the cleanup
because the generation of waste was an inherent part of
Aidex's manufacturing process.
   "Automobiles contain transmission fluid and battery fluid,
which are technically hazardous substances. The fear is that
if you follow this case to its extreme, manufacturers could
be held liable under Superfund for the mere sale of a car,"
says Peter Gillon, a lawyer in the Washington, D.C., office
of the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, which
represents three of the defendants.
   So far, Mr. Gillon says, those fears have gone unrealized.
The government has yet to file other suits using that theory.
But the case has expanded "who might ultimately be liable and
can be brought into a settlement," says Glenn Unterberger,
associate enforcement counsel at EPA.
   Defense lawyers say the greatest litigation threat to
product suppliers comes from other industries seeking to
spread their own cleanup liability. Plaintiffs have relied on
a variety of state claims, including nuisance and negligence,
to make their cases. With several significant cases pending,
courts will be required to decide just how far liability
should extend.
   In one such case, Gelman Sciences Inc., an Ann Arbor,
Mich., maker of microfiltration membranes, faces potentially
huge damages for the contamination of groundwater by the
chemical 1,4-dioxane, which it used in manufacturing until
1986. Gelman filed suit in state court in Ann Arbor against
seven companies that made or sold the chemical alleging they
failed to adequately disclose its dangers and should
therefore bear the cleanup costs.
   The chemical companies have asked the court to dismiss the
case, arguing that they can't be held liable for
environmental problems arising after a normal commercial
sale. They say it is unreasonable to expect them to supervise
the handling of their products. Their motion is pending.

   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange and American Stock
Exchange barred from membership a number of individuals and
disciplined several others for alleged violations of exchange
rules and federal securities laws.
   Gary R. Weaver, a former broker with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., agreed to be barred by the New York exchange
without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The exchange charged
that the Clearwater, Fla., resident, among other things,
misrepresented his authority at the firm by sending out
letters that purported to bind Prudential-Bache to repay
certain loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James Carlton McLamb, a Raleigh, N.C., ex-broker with
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., was barred for what the Big Board
charged was effecting odd-lot transactions at prices more
favorable to customers -- including family accounts -- and
himself than the firm's procedures required. Odd-lot
transactions are trades of less than 100 shares. Mr. McLamb
has appealed the decision to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Also barred by the exchange were Dana Vincent Brackett of
Duxbury, Mass., formerly with A.G. Edwards & Sons; Charles
Cantrell Marshall of Phoenix, formerly with Young, Smith &amp;
Peacock; and Robin Newell of Johnson City, Tenn., formerly
with Merrill Lynch. Mr. Brackett didn't admit or deny any
wrongdoing. The exchange charged the three with, among other
things, misappropriating customer funds.
   Ann Marie Barone of Brooklyn, N.Y., a former broker at
Newhard, Cook &amp; Co., was barred by the New York exchange
until she responds to certain inquiries the exchange has
made.
   Stephen J. Samuels of Boston, a former broker at Merrill
Lynch, agreed to be barred by the Amex without admitting or
denying any wrongdoing. The exchange charged him with
recommending unsuitable trades, effecting options
transactions without customer knowledge or consent, and
issuing false documents showing fictitious transactions,
among other things.
   Thomas E. Malone of San Antonio, a former broker with what
is now Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., was censured and barred
for five years by the Big Board. The exchange charged that he
exercised discretion in certain customer accounts without
authorization, made misstatements to customers, and made
unsuitable trading recommendations.
   Joseph Robert Schwartz of New York, former broker with
Rooney Pace Inc., consented to a censure, a three-year bar
and a $3,000 fine without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
The New York exchange charged Mr. Schwartz with agreeing to
reimburse a customer for losses in an account and making
misstatements to the exchange.
   The following also were disciplined by the exchanges.
Suspensions and fines are noted. All were censured:
   New York Stock Exchange: Louis Matthew Sirota of Brooklyn
and Antoine Omar Khoury of London, each one year; Paul
Stephen Dolan of Boston and Lester Morehart Bolstad Jr. of
Plymouth, Minn., each three months; William Wallace of
Maitland, Fla., $3,000; Dale R. Bonga of Wheaton, Ill.,
$1,500; Daniel Munter of Los Angeles and Arnett Rolland Tharp
of Norfolk, Va., censure only.
   All except Mr. Dolan settled the charges without admitting
or denying wrongdoing.
   American Stock Exchange: Leslie Maladowitz of Cambridge,
Mass., one year and $6,000; William F. Leeson, Greenville,
S.C., suspended as a supervisor for 12 months must requalify
as an options principal; David Naulin of Newport Beach,
Calif., $5,000; Anthony Chrampanis of New York, $1,000.
   All except Mr. Naulin settled the charges without
admitting or denying any wrongdoing. Mr. Leeson declined to
comment, and all others couldn't be reached for comment.

   Revises Its Plan
   To Recapitalize

   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., trying to satisfy its
bondholders and avoid a bankruptcy-law filing, revised its
plan to recapitalize its debt and issue new common stock.
   The communications company, which said its core businesses
are operating profitably, has been struggling under a debt
load of $643 million, which current cash flow can't cover.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company has told the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it will have to file for protection under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code if it can't work out a new agreement
with its bondholders.
   Moreover, Western Union will face a moment of truth on
June 15, when it must make a $51 million interest payment on
its senior notes. It has told the SEC that it could be forced
into default if it can't find sufficient funds to make this
payment. The company's annual interest payments total $116
million.
   To avoid bankruptcy court, Western Union and its principal
owner, New York-based Brooke Partners Limited Partnership,
led by Bennett S. LeBow, the New York financier who also is
Western Union's chairman, have been trying to overhaul the
company's finances. Western Union wants to issue new debt
securities to holders of its senior secured reset notes, due
Dec. 15, 1992, which carry an interest rate of 19.25%, and to
holders of its 16% notes, due June 15, 1991. Debt from these
notes totals $530 million. Western Union also is seeking to
reclassify its preferred stock into new common shares.
   The 139-year-old communications carrier, which has been
hurt by a steep decline in its telex business, has cut its
work force more than half to about 3,300 from 8,000 in the
past two years. It also has scaled its operations back to two
basic businesses: Business Services, which include telex,
electronic mail and Mailgram; and Financial Services, which
include Money Transfer, voice messaging, telegram and bill
payments.
   "We've cleaned up the company," said Robert J. Amman,
Western Union's president and chief executive officer. "Both
of our businesses are healthy and operating profitably. If
we're successful with the exchange offer, Western Union is on
a long-term healthy path."
   Leigh Walzer, an analyst at R.D. Smith &amp; Co., a brokerage
firm that specializes in distressed securities, said Western
Union's problem "is no longer a business problem, it's a
balance sheet problem." He said the first plan's provision of
no interest payments for two years and a 5% interest rate on
some of the securities were "hot buttons" that turned off the
bondholders.
   "Another bone of contention could still be the equity
provision in the common stock that gives the bondholders 20%
immediately and 50% later on," Mr. Walzer said. "The
bondholders might still ask for 50% now. . . . {But} this new
plan is a pretty realistic proposal. I don't think the
company and the holders are especially far apart now."
   Western Union bondholders weren't available to comment.
   In its revised proposal in exchange for each $1,000 face
value of 19.25% senior reset note and 16% note, Western Union
is proposing to issue a new $400, 13% note, due Sept. 14,
1992, and a new $600 note paying 8% interest, due Dec. 31,
1995, plus 150 common shares, 200 Class C common shares and
300 Class D common shares.
   Interest on the 13% and 8% notes would accrue from Dec.
16, 1989, and be payable semiannually in the form of
additional new notes, rather than cash, through Dec. 31,
1991, and Dec. 31, 1992, respectively. In Western Union's
earlier proposal, no interest would have accrued or been
payable on the new notes for two years; also, the rate of
interest on the $600 note would have been 5%, rather than 8%.
   Western Union's current senior reset notes required that
the company reset their interest at a level that would allow
them to trade at par. To accomplish this, the company last
year had to raise the rate from 16.5% to its current level of
19.25%, but the bonds nonetheless are trading at 31 cents on
the dollar, or $310 for each $1,000 note.
   In an April 27 report to the SEC, Western Union said its
operating profit was $95 million from Financial Services and
$72 million from Business Services. But Western Union's cash
flow won't be able to handle the interest burden on its
senior debt, which will hit $96 million this year. The
company said in its quarterly report to the SEC that it
anticipates $102 million in negative cash flow this year and
$38 million in negative cash flow before interest payments
and after asset sales.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Western Union shares closed unchanged at 46.875 cents.

   SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea recorded a
larger-than-expected 10.3% growth in gross national product
during the first three months of this year, according to the
Bank of Korea.
   The central bank's preliminary report said the nation's
GNP in the first quarter of 1990 amounted to 28.4 trillion
won ($40.46 billion), up 10.3% from the previous year's 25.7
trillion won, at 1985 constant prices. In the first quarter
of last year, GNP rose 6.2%. The two-digit number is far
higher than the government's original projection of 6.5% to
7%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In all of 1989, GNP rose by 6.7%, far down from an annual
average of 12% during the 1986-1988 period.
   Bank officials attributed the sharp increase in GNP growth
so far this year to brisk performance in the manufacturing
and construction sectors. The comparatively low growth rate
during the first quarter of last year was a contributing
factor to the sharp increase, they add.
   But officials say the economy isn't firmly in the track of
recovery. The rise wasn't led by exports, which have
traditionally been the engine of growth in South Korea, but
by strong private consumption and a temporary construction
boom, spurred by a housing construction rush.
   The construction sector grew 39.1% during the first
quarter from a year ago, in contrast to a 10.2% rise in the
first quarters of 1988 and 1989. The manufacturing sector
posted 7.1% growth, up from the year-ago first quarter level
of 1.8%.
   The utility sector rose 18.1%, compared with 14.2% a year
ago, largely because of higher electricity and gas
consumption.
   The agriculture, forest and fishery sectors, however,
declined 3.6%, compared with a 9.9% increase a year earlier.
   Private consumption rose by 11.9% largely because of
strength in sales of automobiles and other durable consumer
goods as well as an increase in spending on services. Fixed
investment rose by 32.1% largely because of heavy investment
in construction and facilities.
   Merchandise exports rose a mere 0.1% because of slow
exports of automobiles, toys and other strategic export
items, while imports soared by 15.2%.
   The service sector rose by 9%, compared with 7.2% a year
ago.

   Surprise -- Metal CDs

<LP>
   Your April 18 editorial "Are CDs Recyclable?" commits a
major gaffe in calling music CDs "metal" and "weeds in (the)
garden" (]) of our green, biodegradable earth. The shiny CDs
are sleek new laser plastics not likely to be recycled
because the music -- whether Beethoven or Bon Jovi -- is not
likely to be discarded.
   You should also know that these small, optical prerecorded
discs are also being widely introduced as CD ROMs, with 1,000
times the capacity of standard prerecorded data-storage discs
for personal computers. A larger laser disc (videodisc)
format with interactive video is capable of 5,000 times
today's capacity.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CD ROMs can be far cheaper than today's computer discs or
their drives of equal capacity. Although introductory prices
for CD ROM players have been higher, within a few months they
will likely decline to substantially less (about $500). These
new devices are easily connected to desktop computers already
in use. Are we ready to use 1,000 to 5,000 times the info
available last week? Our educational missions will be
challenged sharply by increased demands for machines,
materials and the production of specially formatted
interactive video.
   There is one desktop computer for every three adults aged
18 to 64 in the U.S., a ratio that likely will double over
the next five years. You can bet that in 10 years, or soon
thereafter, there will be nearly as many personal computers
as adults. New educational initiatives are necessary to help
our students best cope with the wrenching changes resulting
in the school, home and office. Alas, the CD "weeds" will
even be in every editorial office.

   Lufthansa Plans
   To Let Interflug
   Stay Separate

   BRUSSELS -- Lufthansa says it doesn't plan to gobble up
Interflug completely. But the big West German airline won't
be a passive investor in its East German counterpart.
   If Lufthansa's bid for 26% of East German airline
Interflug is approved by regulators, the West German carrier
will treat Interflug as a "subsidiary profit center,"
Lufthansa's chairman said. But he added that "we want
Interflug to remain a separate company."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview here, Heinz Ruhnau also said that the
letter of intent Lufthansa signed in March gives it the right
of first refusal if additional shares of Interflug are
offered to the public. And it's expected that another 23% of
the shares will be put on the market, he said, leaving East
Germany with a 51% stake in Interflug.
   "If there is more to buy, I would have a right to buy
more" shares, he said, adding that the letter of intent
doesn't spell out how much more Lufthansa could purchase. But
Mr. Ruhnau didn't say whether Lufthansa would boost its stake
above 26%.
   Any link with the East German carrier can only increase
Lufthansa's might in a unified Germany. The large airline,
which has 55,000 employees and carried 20.4 million
passengers last year, already dominates not only its home
market but also is a major player in Europe. Interflug, with
its aged, mostly Soviet-built fleet, its 7,000 employees and
1.7 million passengers a year, hardly will be in a position
to resist the wishes of its new benefactor.
   As a result of this and other factors, Lufthansa's plans
for Interflug now are being being examined by the West German
Cartel Office, the European Community Commission and the
newly formed Office for Competition in East Berlin.
   An official of the West German competition agency said
this week that he couldn't predict when those investigations
will be completed. But he said East Germany already has
agreed that Interflug shares won't include access to East
German airports or to landing slots. Separating these rights
from airline ownership probably will mute regulators'
concerns that Lufthansa's market position would be unduly
strengthened by the acquisition, the official said.
   Mr. Ruhnau said there is much work ahead before Interflug
can sell its shares. The airline currently is being valued by
Western auditors so that a price can be set for the assets.
Interflug probably will need to be restructured as well.
Currently, the airline also runs five East German airports,
does aerial photography and air ambulance work and its
agricultural division sprays crops with a fleet of small
aircraft.

   Chairs of Entrepreneurship Are Bad Business
   ----
   By Martin Morse Wooster

   Market-oriented foundations have spent tens of millions
dollars to advance the capitalist cause on university
campuses. Yet capitalism's largest investment in the
collegiate marketplace of ideas has yielded returns lower
than the shakiest grade of junk bond. That's because much of
the money has been donated to universities to establish
chairs of free enterprise and entrepreneurship -- and despite
the wealth of their endowments, these chairs are remarkably
ineffective.
   The first free-enterprise chair was founded at Georgia
State University in 1963; today, according to an April 1989
survey by Jerome Katz of St. Louis University, there are at
least 89 professorships in the U.S., as well as several whole
centers of private enterprise, instilling free enterprise and
entrepreneurship into the minds of students. Baylor
University in Waco, Texas, alone has eight. Chairs have been
created at a rate of eight to 10 a year since 1985. The
movement is world-wide; there are free-enterprise chairs in
the U.S., Canada, England and even India.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Katz estimates that it costs between $1 million and
$2.5 million to endow a full-fledged chair of free enterprise
or entrepreneurship. (Named professorships cost less.) Some
donors have been even more generous. The Coleman Foundation
of Illinois, created from the profits of Fannie May Candies,
has endowed five chairs of entrepreneurship at colleges in
Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri. Frank Kenan, a North
Carolina trucking magnate, was so determined to create the
Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of
North Carolina (Chapel Hill) that he gave $8.5 million to the
university for a building and an additional $3 million for
the institute's budget.
   Nearly $100 million has been invested in endowing
free-enterprise and entrepreneurship chairs. While that's
small change for a major corporation, the same amount, if put
in one place, would create the wealthiest think tank in
America. (The Brookings Institution, whose riches are the
envy of its competitors, has an endowment of only about $85
million.)
   By affixing an aggressively ideological label to their
professorships, the founders of the "free enterprise" chairs
guaranteed that the chairholders would play a marginal role
on college campuses. Michael Mescon, the Georgia State
private-enterprise professor who originated the concept and
holds the very first of these chairs to be created (the
Bernard B. and Eugenia A. Ramsey Chair of Private
Enterprise), says that the free-enterprise name was chosen to
ensure that universities understood the ideologically
motivated nature of the donation: "Everything you do," Mr.
Mescon says, "you do right on top of the table and in broad
daylight." That's exactly why Milton Friedman opposes these
chairs. "I am opposed to chairs of free enterprise," Mr.
Friedman said in an interview, "as I am to chairs of
Marxism-Leninism or socialism."
   The ideological nature of free-enterprise chairs makes it
difficult to find qualified people to occupy them.
Twenty-four of the 89 chairs and professorships of free
enterprise or entrepreneurship counted by Jerome Katz were
unfilled. In part this is due to a problem of credentials; no
one offers doctorates in free enterprise or entrepreneurship.
But often the chairs are left empty while liberal university
presidents and donors complete their delicate and protracted
negotiations. At Trinity College in Connecticut it took five
years to appoint someone to the Shelby Cullom Davis Chair of
American Business and Economic Enterprise.
   On many campuses, however, there is little objection to
chairs of private enterprise or entrepreneurship for one
simple reason -- the chairholders do little that would annoy
anyone.
   Few holders of free-enterprise chairs conduct serious
scholarship. In a 1985 survey by the Baylor University Center
for Private Enterprise, 51% of the free-enterprise and
entrepreneurship chairholders surveyed said they placed
"extensive emphasis" on training elementary and high-school
teachers in economics; only 17% said they attached similar
importance to scholarship, equal to the number who said they
stressed the production of training manuals. Only 11 of the
51 papers presented at the 1989 annual meeting of the
Association for Private Enterprise Education were about
economics; the remainder were on business-related topics: how
entrepreneurs like independence and should be more creative.
   The activities of centers of private enterprise are also
oriented away from research. At Baylor University, Center for
Private Enterprise Director Calvin Kent is proudest of a
program, funded by a $200,000 grant from the Pew Charitable
Trusts, that encourages inner-city youths to be entrepreneurs
by introducing them to suitable role models. Rollie Tillman
Jr., director of the Kenan Institute for Private Enterprise,
promises that his institute will, in time, attach more
importance to original research, but says that his
organization's chief product at the moment is a series of
television interviews with H. Ross Perot, Mary Kay Ash and
Roger Horchow. "We've got a lot of input," Mr. Tillman says,
"but our output is just beginning." The institute is also the
headquarters of the National Entrepreneur Hall of Fame.
   At Beloit College in Wisconsin, Jerry Gustafson,
Coleman/Fannie May Professor of Entrepreneurship, who had
already been a tenured professor of economics at Beloit, says
that his course load has changed relatively little since his
chair was endowed in 1986. Mr. Gustafson uses the $1 million
invested in him by the Coleman Foundation to convince
students that self-employment is a pleasant notion. He hopes
to be able to award $2,000 to $2,500 start-up grants to
Beloit students who may wish to start their own companies,
and lobbies his colleagues to advise their students that
working for themselves is just as worthy as going to graduate
school. The Coleman Foundation, Mr. Gustafson says, "isn't
interested in being ideological at all. They're just trying
to present options rather than push an agenda."
   Certainly whispering the praises of capitalism or helping
poor people escape the ghetto are noble goals. But the
millions invested by free-enterprise chair donors have done
little to change the tone or nature of the debate over ideas
in American colleges and universities. Of what use is it, for
example, to pay a tenured economics professor's salary if a
college can use the money saved to pay for socialist
speakers? Frank Ellsworth, president of Pitzer College in
California reminds donors that of all forms of gifts to
colleges, an endowed chair "is the hardest mechanism for a
donor to control the outcome."
   The millionaires who endow free-enterprise chairs would
find their gifts put to better use at the dozens of
market-oriented think tanks. For the price of a
free-enterprise chair, a donor could pay for a year's budget
of a first-rate research organization, such as the Cato
Institute or the Manhattan Institute.

   WASHINGTON -- European countries, with some help from the
U.S., defeated a Japanese proposal to set uniform standards
for high-definition television, making it more likely that
the new technology will develop differently on three
continents.
   The decision to defer adopting an HDTV production
standard, made at an international telecommunications
conference in Duesseldorf, West Germany, was largely a
symbolic blow to the Japanese. Japan Broadcasting Corp. plans
to start high-definition TV broadcasts in Japan next summer,
after the launch of two video satellites. So far, the
Japanese are about one year behind schedule. European
television makers, grouped together within the Eureka EU 95
project, are pushing their own standards. So are Zenith
Electronics Corp. and others in the U.S.

   High-definition TV refers to a host of new technologies
aimed at producing video monitors with super-sharp images.
The technology has become an important trade issue because of
predictions that the new sets will come to dominate the
consumer electronics market and produce huge business for
makers of semiconductor chips. The first sets are expected to
go on sale in the U.S. in the mid-1990s.
   In 1986, Japan, backed by the U.S., proposed to set a
standard for the production of high-definition videotapes.
These standards would be important for producing such studio
equipment as cameras and professional video-tape recorders, a
relatively small market.
   The Japanese also apparently hoped that getting their
production standard approved would help win approval of a
separate standard for transmitting high-definition shows to
homes world-wide. Winning approval of that standard could
mean tens of millions of dollars in royalty payments and give
a leg-up to producers of the new television sets.
   European countries, which wanted to develop their own
standard to protect their electronics industries, defeated
the 1986 proposal. Since that time, the U.S. backed away from
the Japanese proposal, and the Europeans continued their
opposition.
   In the U.S., a production standard isn't likely to be
adopted until after 1993, when the Federal Communications
Commission is scheduled to chose a standard for HDTV
broadcasts. It now seems likely that the U.S., Europe and
Japan will use different production and transmission systems
for the new technology.

   GOP War Chest
   Surpasses by Far
   Democrats' Sum

   In 15 Months, Republicans
   Received $113 Million,

   WASHINGTON -- The national Republican political committees
continue to hold a huge cash advantage over their Democratic
counterparts, according to a study by the Federal Election
Commission.
   In the 15 months ended in March, the three major
committees of the Republican Party raised a total of $113
million, compared with $24 million for the three Democratic
national committees. In overall spending, the Republicans
held a four-to-one lead over the Democrats.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With the 1990 campaign season about to move into high
gear, the Republican committees had $19 million in cash
reserves at March 31; the Democrats had only $6 million on
hand. As impressive as are the GOP totals, however, the
Republican committees have yet to raise as much as they did
in 1984.
   Fundraising results for the Democratic National Committee
and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee trailed
1986 and 1988 levels in the 15-month period covered by the
FEC study. But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,
which raised $10 million, surpassed its fund-raising totals
of 1986 and 1988.
   Still, Ron Brown, DNC chairman, said: "The DNC's
fund-raising program has made substantial progress over the
past year and is on track with the Democratic Party's
financial goals."
   At the same time the FEC released its study, the Democrats
made public a list of the party's top "soft money" donors,
who gave a total of $3.6 million to the party in 1989 and the
first quarter of 1990. Soft money consists of donations that
aren't spent directly on campaigns and thus aren't restricted
by federal election laws.
   Congress is considering a ban on "soft money" as part of
campaign-finance legislation. The DNC had resisted making
public its list of "soft money" contributors while the Senate
was considering the bill. Late last month, the Republican
Party released a list of wealthy donors who gave the party a
total of more than $7 million in "soft money" donations in
1989 and 1990.
   Among the top Democratic "soft money" contributors were a
number of labor unions, corporations and wealthy individuals.
They included: Archer-Daniels Midland Corp., $55,000;
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees,
$150,400; Frederick Field, a California investor, $103,400;
Monte Friedkin, a Florida millionaire, $100,000; Jerome
Kohlberg, a co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, $25,000;
National Education Association, $135,000; Maurice Tempelsman,
a New York diamond merchant, $25,000; United Steel Workers
union, $100,000; United Auto Workers union, $130,000. Mr.
Brown's Washington law firm, Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow gave
$10,500.

   DETROIT -- Frank Rekasi is preparing for doomsday.
   The 39-year-old auto worker isn't hoarding canned food or
building a bomb shelter. Instead, he has begun a second
career as a designer and producer of clothing for "people
with freer cash" than his daytime associates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Rekasi hopes to keep his regular blue-collar job as a
statistical processor at General Motors Corp. for a long
time. But the 20-year GM veteran learned a disturbing lesson
in the early 1980s, when a huge wave of plant closings and
employee layoffs hit the U.S. auto industry. Watching
co-workers cope with the shock of dismissal, Mr. Rekasi
realized "you have to prepare yourself for the ultimate. You
might have a job now, but what about later?"
   So Mr. Rekasi turned a sewing hobby into a second job,
laying a foundation for a future without GM.
   He is among a growing number of what are being called
defensive entrepreneurs: people who, while continuing in
their regular jobs, are developing new careers -- for psychic
as well as financial reasons. They're sacrificing weekends
and vacations to moonlight as small-scale landlords,
innkeepers, studio photographers, mechanics and owners of
hardware stores and hair salons.
   "I don't know if we're visionaries," Mr. Rekasi says.
"Maybe we're masochists or we just have a need to be active."
   Certainly people have always had hobbies, and moonlighting
isn't new. But the tremendous restructuring that hit
corporate America in the 1980s brought a new sense of
insecurity to many employees. Hundreds of thousands faced
unexpected layoff. Now, "by and large, people don't trust
their companies anymore," contends Quinn Mills, professor of
business administration at Harvard Business School.
   People who began their careers 20 or more years ago at
paternalistic companies tended to feel they had an implicit
contract guaranteeing them employment as long as they did
their job well. Now, Prof. Mills says, "that contract no
longer exists."
   Defensive entrepreneurship isn't easy. Nurturing side
ventures demands time and resources. There are no guarantees
these businesses will succeed, to say nothing of growing
enough to provide support if a job is lost. If the business
founders, invested money will vanish with it.
   Mr. Rekasi discovered a less-predictable hazard. Some
fellow union members initially resented his clothing design
business. "Some said that I believed I was too good for
them," he recalls. "Some say why not get out {of GM} so that
others who don't have a job can work."
   Still, three workers who have chosen to open small
businesses while employed say the risks are a small price to
pay for gaining some control over their future. The
insecurity at their places of employment is evident from some
numbers: The three employers -- GM, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. and International Business Machines Corp. --
have reduced their work forces by a total of at least 87,000,
counting those who left through early-retirement programs.
                                                                                                       

   Private Property
                                                                                                       

   Gregory Cesario started a real estate business several
years before voluntarily accepting an early-retirement
package from IBM. "I probably wouldn't have taken the buy-out
if I didn't have the business," says the 47-year-old
bachelor. "It helped me to make my decision."
   For the last eight of his 19 years at IBM, Mr. Cesario, a
middle manager in the company's industrial operations, had
dodged at least five departmental mergers and staff
reductions. He even tried to make himself more valuable to
IBM by learning about operations outside his department. "I
had visions of being in one of the top corporate echelons,"
he says. "IBM was all I wanted to do. But it had become
corporate musical chairs. When the music stopped, there were
fewer chairs than there were people."
   Concerned about his future, Mr. Cesario in the late 1970s
began buying modestly priced resort property to manage. In
the spring of 1988, he began laying the groundwork for his
first restaurant. "I didn't want to have 100% dependency on
IBM as a source of income. I wanted to be able to make
choices and not be told by IBM here is the choice made for
you."
   In December 1988, he got his wish: He volunteered for an
IBM early retirement program that amounted to two years'
salary plus $25,000. Mr. Cesario, now part-owner of three
restaurants, has traded managing a department for dish
washing, table clearing and bathroom cleaning, among other
duties. And his real estate holdings have expanded to include
condos and single-family residences, which he may rent out or
fix up and resell.
   Still, giving up a $90,000-a-year salary, bonuses and
frequent expense-account trips hasn't been easy. The
restaurant and real estate operations generate only about a
third what IBM paid him, so "now I think twice about hopping
on a plane," Mr. Cesario says, adding he's taken only two
business trips in the past two years.
   He hasn't played golf in almost a year, even though the
backyard of his Deerfield Beach, Fla., villa abuts a golf
course. And a "personal relationship is in jeopardy because
of all the time I have to devote to the businesses."
   He admits that "there have been nights where I come home
and watch the ceiling fan go around and around, wondering if
I did the right thing." But there have been many rewards, he
says. "I work when I want to work. I had the choice. It's all
mine."
                                                                                                       

   Room at the Inn
                                                                                                       

   Restoring old houses was just a hobby for Joseph Mulay
until deregulation of the telephone industry forced AT&amp;T to
divest itself of some of its holdings in the early 1980s. Mr.
Mulay, now 51, had a secure job as a planning and development
manager when he and another AT&amp;T employee decided to buy an
old Victorian house and refurbish it as a bed-and-breakfast
inn.
   Mr. Mulay, divorced with two grown children, wanted
something to fill his time. A former co-worker who was
eligible for a retirement package but waived it had told Mr.
Mulay he didn't feel as though he had enough outside
interests to keep him occupied if he left the company.
   Mr. Mulay's plan was that by the time he turned 55 the inn
would be open and profitable and he would retire from AT&amp;T.
His partner, Paula Williams, took an AT&amp;T buy-out in 1985 to
set up and run the Stanhope, N.J., operation day to day. He
gave up vacations and weekends to restore the house, which
opened in 1986 as the Whistling Swan Inn. So far, it covers
Ms. Williams's living expenses, and other income is plowed
back into the business.
   Then last November, four years ahead of his schedule, Mr.
Mulay accepted an early-retirement package after 32 years at
AT&amp;T. It appeared AT&amp;T would continue downsizing for some
time and "there were just fewer opportunities to move
forward," he said. The package, combined with the inn, helped
make the transition easier.
   After five months, Mr. Mulay is still undergoing
withdrawal from corporate life. The inn gives him "a
schedule, some requirements and a deadline," things he still
clearly needs. Other things he can do without. While
rummaging through his closet a couple of weeks before he left
AT&amp;T "it dawned on me that I don't need all these suits," he
says. "That part of my life is gone."
                                                                                                       

   Design for Living
                                                                                                       

   Frank Rekasi isn't ready yet to make his break even though
life at GM has become less secure. He says a "gut feeling"
kept him from taking a job at a new factory GM was touting in
Hamtramck, Mich., in 1985. Instead, he chose to stay in
material operations at an antiquated plant nearby that GM had
promised to close.
   His instinct proved correct. The new GM plant had problems
almost from the start with equipment and with slow sales of
the luxury cars built there. When GM laid off the second
shift of workers in 1986, only 16 months after the "plant of
the future" opened, Mr. Rekasi realized he couldn't depend on
the auto maker for lifetime employment.
   So he began devoting more time to clothing design. He
designs and produces evening attire and ensembles for
entertainers, specializing in leather. His leather dresses
start at $100, and a leather suit may sell for $2,500.
   Mr. Rekasi's father, who had worked 38 years at GM, didn't
approve of his starting a business on his own. "He said I
would never make a penny," recalls Mr. Rekasi, who is married
and has two children. "He couldn't understand. He said GM
takes care of its own."
   But industrial competition has stiffened, and GM and many
other corporate giants can no longer make such promises. Over
the past five years, GM has bumped Mr. Rekasi to various
plants in the Detroit area; he has been temporarily laid off
several times.
   His new business is more steady, even though it generates
revenue equal to only about a third of the $40,000 to $60,000
he earns a year at GM. But he says it is profitable, and has
helped get his family through the layoffs, including one
four-month period in 1987. During that period his clothing
business soared, convincing him he could make it if he had to
leave GM permanently.
   He hopes he won't have to for at least 10 years, though.
He still depends on GM for family medical benefits, and uses
part of his salary to build the clothing business.
   Between GM and clothing design, Mr. Rekasi works 12 to 14
hours a day and has given up some of his weekends. "Sometimes
there is a question of which is the second business," he
says. His wife helps out, managing the office in Lathrup
Village, a suburb of Detroit, and handling bookkeeping.
   Still, the demands on Mr. Rekasi sometimes leave him
little time for his 10-year-old son and eight-year-old
daughter, who don't always understand why daddy sometimes
spends so many hours making sketches and sewing when the
family is together in the evening. "Sometimes they ask, `Dad,
you got a minute?' and I don't," he says.
   This is painful for Mr. Rekasi, who remembers his father
giving up family life for work. "I had said I would not do
what my father did. But I have no choice."

   Longhorn Gothic Complete With Band Saw

   The Texas murder book, with gore galore, is a phenomenon
of the American publishing industry. You wonder how there
could possibly be 17 million Texans, given our penchant for
bumping each other off in ways bizarre and extravagant.
   Money and sex commonly are stage center in the Gothic
accounts. We have plastic surgeons who poison their womenfolk
and amorous housewives who chop up their rivals with axes.

   For several years a famous Methodist minister from Dallas
has been chief suspect in the strangulation of his wife --
who, inconveniently for the minister, lingers on in
vegetative condition. The minister was conducting a torrid
love affair with the daughter of a former Methodist bishop.
   You see what I mean about Texas? Maybe it is something in
the manure. Kelly Fero's "The Zani Murders" (Texas Monthly,
322 pages, $17.95) is about murder in Texas, but somehow it
doesn't fit comfortably into the Texas-murder-book category.
   There's gore, naturally. Robert Zani, our protagonist,
does more than just kill his mother. He beats her over the
head with a hammer until -- well, you don't want to hear
about that. That's before he takes her and his band saw into
the basement.
   Nor is this the full extent of Zani's crime. In 1967 he
executed a convenience-store clerk who was a leading light of
Students for a Democratic Society. Aha, we think, political
overtones] A right-wing nut. But maybe not. Certainly in his
personal life, Zani took a non-discriminatory line. His wife
was a round-faced Mexican prostitute, Irma Serrano, ugly as a
mud fence, to judge from her photo.
   The capstone of Zani's career, had not the police caught
him first, might have been the serial murder of real estate
agents. Zani had decided to support his family by murdering
doctors and real estate agents, whose professions he
despised. Lawyers somehow escaped his notice, though they
would seem completely suited to his twin purposes of revenue
and enrichment.
   Using false names and stories, he made appointments with
unsuspecting agents. For hours on end, they would explore
this property and that one, while Zani checked out prospects
for mayhem.
   Several agents had chilling experiences in Zani's company,
but only one was actually slain -- an elderly San Antonio man
trying to sell a piece of rural property. Zani and Irma (as
she subsequently confessed) shot him three times. He was
carrying just $3 in cash.
   A few months later, the cops nabbed Zani in a motel.
Additional murders were suspected, but nothing else was
proved. He was tried and convicted of the 1967 murder and
sent to prison for 99 years.
   It's all very grim, and pretty soon the reader starts
wondering what to make of it. What's the big picture here --
the picture that Texas murder books usually succeed at
painting?
   Mr. Fero, an Austin journalist, isn't forthcoming with
explanations. We never do find out what makes Zani tick. We
know he has cold, dark eyes, but he isn't exactly your
everyday sociopath, having graduated from the University of
Texas, where he worked as a translator in the university's
archives. One year he ran for student-body president on the
Mickey Mouse ticket and received nearly 1,000 votes.
   Though Mr. Fero asserts that Zani belonged to "the
anti-integrationist" Young Americans for Freedom, the reader
gathers he mainly was just a sun nut.
   From the text it's reasonably clear that Mr. Fero didn't
interview Zani. Maybe Zani wouldn't cooperate. Whatever the
case, we end up not knowing nearly enough about just what
makes him wacko.
   The hint is imparted that Irma was his evil genius, but it
is a hint only, and goes undeveloped. Robert Zani never
becomes a figure of Madame Tussaudian horror; by today's
standards, he is neither particularly monstrous, nor is he
ordinary with that ordinariness that, manifested in certain
criminals, chills our marrow. We read dreary stretches of
courtroom testimony without appeasing our curiosity about
this man, and ultimately the experience becomes irritating.
   That's the bad news, from the reader's standpoint. The
good news is what Mr. Fero does with the cops. Two Hispanic
detectives on the Austin police force, Paul Ruiz and Robert
Martinez, cracked the 1967 murders, 13 years after they had
been committed. They weighed and sifted evidence ignored by
their predecessors on the case. They showed extraordinary
initiative. Mr. Fero is a little sociologically sanctimonious
for my taste. The racist white cops couldn't crack the case
but the brown ones could, is what he seems to be telling us.
Who cares? The brown cops did a heck of a job. They were
dogged, perceptive, and fair. Ruiz and Martinez are credits
to the profession, and it is bracing to read in meticulous
detail of their modus operandi.
   Yes, occasionally at least, good guys show up in the
Texas-murder-book genre: standing out against a backdrop of
weirdos and sociopaths, reminding us that crime is guaranteed
to pay only in the publishing house's balance books.

   Boeing Co. confirmed that it received firm orders valued
at $3.1 billion for 20 747-400 jetliners from Japan Air
Lines. The order included options JAL exercised for 15 planes
and five orders booked but not announced in February, Boeing
said.
   The order, disclosed by JAL in Tokyo, includes options to
buy 34 more jetliners. Boeing valued the 54-plane package at
about $7.5 billion in current dollars, including $130 million
a plane plus spare parts and training.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   JAL's quoted cost for each 747-400, about $158 million a
plane, would place the total value of the 54-plane order at
$8.53 billion. Boeing couldn't fully explain its own lower
valuation, but a spokesman said that the difference might be
in future costs for parts and training. If JAL exercises its
34-plane option, "there won't be much training to be added
and the spares requirement (will go) down," he said.
   Seattle-based Boeing said that the order brings to 40 the
number of 747-400s ordered by JAL. The airline said it has
taken delivery on five of the jumbo jets so far. Deliveries
are expected to continue at the rate of about four a year
through 1999, Boeing said.
   Separately, General Electric Co. said in Evendale, Ohio,
that its GE Aircraft Engine unit received firm orders from
JAL for engines to power the 20 Boeing planes, and optional
orders for the additional 34 planes. GE said the orders for
the so-called CF6 engines, including the options, are valued
at $1.8 billion.
   JAL has ordered 104 planes from the 747 family since 1966,
Boeing said. The latest order brings to 1,002 the total
number of Boeing's firm orders for jetliners in the 747
family, of which 279 are for the 747-400.
   The 747-400 widebodies give JAL the ability to carry 375
to 404 passengers in a three-class configuration on flights
linking Tokyo with European and U.S. destinations. The
747-400 has a range of up to 8,400 miles and consumes 11% to
15% less fuel than its predecessor, the 747-300, Boeing said.
The aerospace concern said that it has delivered 70 747-400s
since the new model was rolled out in January 1989.
   With Japan's new wealth, air travel is booming. While the
nation's airports are clogged and operating at capacity,
completion of a new international airport in Osaka and
expansion of Tokyo's two airports, Narita and Haneda,
represents significant opportunity for expansion, JAL said.
People in the airline industry expect the growth rate for
Japanese domestic and international air travel to reach 6% a
year for the next 10 years.

   NEW YORK -- Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.
is being shaken up as management moves to revamp the
executive suite and slash expenses.
   Yesterday, Equitable said chief financial officer, Glenn
T. Gettier, resigned to pursue other business interests. The
resignation of Mr. Gettier, 47 years old, follows John B.
Carter's abrupt departure from the company.

   Mr. Gettier was unavailable for comment yesterday.
   Last week, Equitable announced that Mr. Carter, 55, was
retiring as president and chief executive officer, effective
immediately. The company said Mr. Carter had no immediate
future plans. Mr. Carter's duties were assumed by Richard H.
Jenrette, the company's chairman and chief investment
officer.
   People within the company who didn't want to be identified
say Equitable's board had been extremely displeased with Mr.
Carter's inability to improve the company's financial
condition consistently in recent years.
   Now that Mr. Jenrette has been installed as Equitable's
top executive, he wants to move quickly to streamline other
management positions and reduce expenses, a problem that has
plagued the insurer in recent years.
   Equitable said Thomas M. Kirwan will assume the chief
financial officer duties for the entire company as part of a
program to consolidate three separate financial oversight
groups into one unit. Mr. Kirwan had previously served as an
executive vice president and chief financial officer of
Equitable Insurance Cos., Equitable's main operating unit.
   "The merging of the financial reporting functions will
streamline operations, reduce costs and will provide improved
financial controls and information," said Mr. Jenrette.
   A companywide program to cut costs, which began late last
year and is known around Equitable as "Project Focus,"
appears to have intensified in the last week. Company
employees quoted Mr. Jenrette as saying in the last week that
"over the next 100 days, the company has to cut $100 million
in expenses."
   In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week, he
said that Equitable, the nation's third-largest life
insurance company, had cut expenses by about $50 million in
the last two years and had plans to reduce costs by an equal
amount this year.
   As part of Project Focus, agents' commissions on incentive
life insurance policies and certain health insurance plans
have been reduced. The company said a new incentive life
product was being designed that would carry higher
commissions. Travel has been severely curtailed and operating
departments' purchasing practices and expenses are being
closely monitored.
   There are also rumors at the company that incentive
bonuses for 1990 will be reduced or eliminated. Middle
managers could get bonuses ranging between 12% and 14% of
their salaries, while executives at the vice-president level
and higher might receive year-end bonuses of 20% to 50% of
their annual pay. A company spokesperson said decisions on
bonuses aren't made until year's end.
   In 1989, Equitable reported a much smaller increase in
surplus, which is equivalent to a decrease in earnings.
Surplus increased $14.9 million to $1.33 billion. A year
earlier, Equitable's surplus increased $63 million to $1.31
billion. Mutual companies don't report earnings as such.
   The company attributed the results to a downturn in its
guaranteed income contract business, which produced a loss
that it didn't specify. Equitable also cited a one-time,
after-tax charge of about $20 million, related to the decline
in market value of its investment in Lomas Financial Corp. A
still high expense level contributed to the lower 1989
results.
   Raymond L. Colotti, chief financial officer for the
Equitable Investment Corp., which oversees the company's five
investment units, will be transferred to Mr. Kirwan's group
as part of the consolidation.

   NEW YORK -- Telerate Inc. said it laid off 41 employees in
its Americas and corporate groups as part of cost-cutting
moves.
   Telerate is the financial information-service subsidiary
of Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a letter to employees, Carl M. Valenti, Telerate's
president, said sales staffs were "only minimally affected"
by the cutback. Telerate has about 2,500 employees. Mr.
Valenti said he doesn't anticipate any further layoffs in the
Americas group, which includes U.S., Canadian and Latin
American operations, or elsewhere in the immediate future.
   Mr. Valenti said Telerate's Europe-Gulf region and
Asia-Pacific region "continue to show strong progress" and
are reporting double-digit sales growth. However, the
Americas group "is having a much tougher time this year" due
to contraction in Wall Street firms and continued problems in
the U.S. thrift industry.
   He said the Americas group revenue has declined and
Telerate earnings "are down significantly so far this year,
due mostly to major increases in expenses."

   Mexicans Fall Into Step on Bank Moves

   Nationalization Backers
   Now Favor Privatization

   MEXICO CITY -- As Mexico does its version of the economic
shuffle, everyone shimmies in step with "el presidente."
   Witness the quick acceptance of President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari's initiative to return the commercial banking
system to private hands. The same congressman who eight years
ago praised the "brave and patriotic" nationalization, last
week lauded the "firm, patriotic and decisive" privatization.
Both houses of Congress have overwhelmingly approved it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For a matter treated so cavalierly by politicians, the
nationalization fundamentally reshaped Mexico's economy and
left lasting scars on the Mexican psyche. With funds of the
nationalized banks tied up financing the public sector,
Mexico's long-ignored stock market emerged as one of the
world's fastest-growing. Enrollment at economics schools
soared and Mexico's first financial newspaper found an
audience, as Mexicans groped to understand what was happening
to their money.
   What follows are the stories of four people who now find
themselves trying mightly to adapt to the privatization:
                                                                                                       

   The Pundit
                                                                                                       

   When news of the nationalization broke eight years ago,
Luis Pazos picked his jaw off the floor and did what came
naturally: He began to write. Displaying the stamina of the
long-distance runner that he is, Mr. Pazos worked round the
clock to finish his manuscript in two weeks. "The
Nationalization of the Banks" was in bookstores by the end of
the month.
   "This sold 60,000 books and had six printings in two
months -- in a country where people don't read books," he
boasts. Mr. Pazos's hard-core brand of laissez-faire
capitalism has struck a chord among a middle class
disaffected with economic populism. Besides turning out about
one best seller a year since 1982, Mr. Pazos hosts his own
radio program, gives seminars to businessmen and writes for
newspapers in many countries, including The Wall Street
Journal's editorial pages.
   Critics point out that the popularity of Mr. Pazos's work
grows as the economy deteriorates. And those who allow that
Mr. Pazos was a necessary antidote to the populists, say he
continues criticizing Mexico's current reformist government
because he doesn't know how to do anything else.
   "They call me an opportunist," Mr. Pazos says. "An
oversimplifier."
   They call him worse than that. One Mexican official calls
him "the ambulance chaser of economics." In 1981 another
official accused him of an "extremism {that} leads ultimately
to fascism." That critic was a young budget ministry
bureaucrat named Carlos Salinas.
                                                                                                       

   The Nationalizer
                                                                                                       

   Clemente Ruiz was an up-and-coming budget official still
in his 20s when he helped draft the 1982 nationalization. "We
wanted a financial system for common people, not
speculators," he says.
   This month, Mr. Ruiz was seated in a cramped cubicle in
the national university -- not a corner office of the
National Palace -- when he heard that President Salinas was
undoing the most significant thing Mr. Ruiz had ever done.
"An historic opportunity has been lost," he says.
   These days, having been an economic policy maker in the
Lopez Portillo administration isn't an item to highlight on
your resume. The former president himself gets barked at when
he appears in public, a reminder of his promise to "defend
the peso like a dog" shortly before he devalued it. On
campus, Mr. Ruiz is in a kind of intellectual exile, though
he's unrepentant about his role in the nationalization.
   Mr. Ruiz says the Lopez Portillo government had to take
drastic action when collapsing oil prices set off a financial
panic so severe that at least $300 million was transferred
out of the country from one midsized Mexican bank in a single
day. He says the nationalized banks helped private-sector
companies work out their debts, and enabled the government to
impose wage, price and exchange-rate controls that have
smothered inflation.
                                                                                                       

   The Banker
                                                                                                       

   In 1982, as they did every year, several dozen of the most
powerful businessmen in Mexico gathered in front of a
television to watch the state of the union address. Rolando
Vega, chief executive officer of a midsized bank, followed
the speech with an advance copy of the text before him. As
the president strayed from the text here and there, Mr. Vega
clung to the hope that he might not lose his bank. Reality
didn't really set in until Mr. Vega later saw troops ringing
the bank lobby.
   After the speech, most of the businessmen went to a
presidential reception. Not Mr. Vega. "I'm not going to greet
someone who insults me," Mr. Vega said.
   The generally apolitical business community has been
divided ever since. Mr. Vega softened toward the next
government after he was allowed to buy back a stake in his
bank and participate in the liberalized financial services
industry. Last year, the still divided business community
named Mr. Vega as compromise choice to head the largest
business lobby, the Business Coordinating Council.
   Now that business has won its demand for private banks,
Mr. Vega says it will show its appreciation by bringing home
some of the estimated $80 billion held abroad by Mexicans.
                                                                                                       

   The Expatriate
                                                                                                       

   When Mexico appeared to go socialist, as Raul de Alba
thought possible after the bank nationalization, San Antonio,
Texas, stood a chance to become for Mexicans what Miami is
for exiled Cubans. Mr. de Alba, a financial adviser who first
came to Texas after a peso devaluation in 1976, became a
godfather to the few hundred moneyed Mexican familes that
straggled to San Antonio after the nationalization.
   One expatriate businessman was so fearful for money he had
brought from Mexico and of the long-arm of the Mexican
government, that he scrambled out of the lobby of a Texas
savings institution at the mere sight of the security
cameras.
   But now the bold, young Mr. Salinas has come along. "He's
some guy," says Mr. de Alba. "Mexico's future is very
exciting, and I'm looking for a lot of trade with Mexico, a
lot of cross-border investment."

   SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. plans to close its
multiwire division in Hicksville, N.Y., in 60 days, if the
company fails to sell it.
   The closing of the division would complete Kollmorgen's
planned disposition of its electronic interconnections
business. James A. Eder, Kollmorgen secretary, said the
closing, together with other sales in the business segment,
wouldn't significantly affect earnings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The multiwire plant, which has 142 employees, manufactures
proprietary interconnection products. Kollmorgen will retain
its operations in motors and controls and electro-optical
instruments.
   John Youngblood, Kollmorgen chairman, president and chief
executive, said the company would continue to try to find a
buyer for the division, but he said the company believed that
is unlikely.
   Mr. Eder said the entire electronic interconnections
business was classified as a discontinued operation last
September, when the company announced a restructuring that
called for disposing of the entire segment. That segment once
acccounted for one-third of Kollmorgen's operations. Mr. Eder
said provisions against earnings for a possible closing of
the multiwire division had previously been made.
   Kollmorgen has been trying to fend off a takeover attempt
by Vernitron Corp., a closely held motors and controls
company based in Deer Park, N.Y. The two companies are suing
each other over a collapsed merger agreement, and Vernitron
is mounting a proxy contest for control of Kollmorgen's
board. Vernitron has said it would offer $15 a share for 50%
of Kollmorgen's shares, if it is successful in its proxy
solicitation.

   The Gallery: Blacks in American Art

   Brooklyn, N.Y. -- It isn't surprising that "Facing
History: The Black Image in American Art, 1710-1940" is a
polemical exhibition. The material gathered at the Brooklyn
Museum until June 25 invites controversy, because its subject
matter and its thesis are provocative. But the exhibition,
and especially its catalog, by black art historian Guy C.
McElroy with an essay by the black
scholar-entrepreneur-celebrity Henry Louis Gates Jr., often
overwhelms or distorts the art.
   This happens in two main ways. The first is through the
application of a polemical argument to pictures that seem
inherently to resist clearcut ideological interpretation. The
second is through the inclusion of a number of works that
invite polemics but that hardly qualify as works of art.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Francis Guy's "Winter Scene in Brooklyn" (circa 1817-20)
is a charmingly animated street scene with figures so small
that you can hardly make out who is black and who is white.
But this doesn't prevent the catalog from seeing in it the
servile and "not very important" role of the blacks.
   By contrast, a work such as Nicolino Calyo's "Negro Dancer
and Banjo Player" (1835) does show clear racial stereotypes,
but it is so banal and simplistic an image that it hardly
deserves display in an art museum.
   Although this exhibition is billed as a history of the
black image "in American fine art," it is something both less
and more than that. Many of the works here are of low
artistic quality, and are included primarily for their
sociological interest. But the exhibition is not quite a
pictorial history of American attitudes toward blacks,
either. For by avoiding crude and violent images (some of
which are illustrated in the catalog), the exhibition pulls
its punches as social history. After all, the treatment of
American blacks between 1710 and 1940 was generally much
worse than one would be led to believe solely on the evidence
of the paintings in this show.
   In terms of its "fine art" content, the exhibition seems
to ignore the important point that paintings cannot be fully
interpreted without taking artistic quality, as well as
subject matter, into account. For while some artists are able
to convey the complexity and ambiguity of human situations in
their pictures, others depict almost everything in a
sentimental or stereotyped way. This is one of the
differences between major and minor artists -- and between
artists and mere illustrators. Not surprisingly, a number of
the banal stereotypes of blacks in this show were painted by
artists who also painted equally banal stereotypes of whites.
   Unfortunately, because of this exhibition's ideological
program, these kinds of distinctions tend to be ignored.
Little differentiation is made between the sorts of
"messages" contained in works by strong artists such as
Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer or Eastman Johnson, and those
conveyed by banal illustrational works done by minor artists
such as Calyo, Charles Deas or Lilly Martin Spencer. By not
adequately addressing the question of artistic quality, this
exhibition only partially addresses the role of race in
American "fine art" and in a sense falls victim to the very
sort of stereotyping that it set out to criticize.
   The emphasis on ideology rather than art is particularly
disturbing because there seem to be more docents leading
groups through this show than at any other recent exhibition
I have seen. And on the evidence of my own eavesdropping,
what many of these docents are telling their charges picks up
the attitudes expressed in the catalog and on the wall
plaques and runs with them in rather extreme ways.
   A case in point is Eakins's "Will Schuster and Blackman
Going Shooting" (1876), in which a red-shirted white man is
shooting a rifle from a boat balanced by a plainly dressed
black oarsman. The catalog makes much of the fact that the
white man's name is given in the title, while the black man
is "identified only in terms of race," and disapprovingly
remarks the differences between the two men's social and
economic positions. The wall plaque notes that although
"blacks were described carefully and sympathetically by
Eakins, they were never depicted in the front of a white
man's boat." Taking their lead from the catalog and wall
plaque, some of the lecturers whom I saw bring groups before
this painting characterized Eakins as a flat-out racist.
   But in fact the depiction of the black man in this
painting is both more individuated and more humanly
sympathetic than that of the white man. And while the
discrepancies in naming, like the relative positions of the
men in the boat, reflect a hard social reality, Eakins's
sympathies are much broader than the cliches that are used to
describe the painting. Moreover, since this is basically a
realist work it seems only reasonable that the artist would
reflect the actual social realities of the time, whether or
not they were pleasant ones.
   With similar complexity, John Singleton Copley's "Watson
and the Shark" (1778) presents one of the subtlest and most
nuanced portrayals of a black man by any American artist. In
this picture, which was based on a real incident, a boatful
of men desperately attempt to rescue the naked Francis Watson
from the menacing jaws of a giant shark. The sole black man
in the picture dominates the scene below him with gravity and
power. It is he who stands at the apex of the group and it is
he who holds the rope that has been thrown to Watson.
Moreover, the alert downward gesture of the black man's hand
movingly echoes that of Watson's upward reaching arm -- a
poignant and pointed reversal of the customary social
hierarchy.
   Given that Watson's business interests were connected to
the slave trade, and that Copley sided with England during
the Revolutionary War, this painting is fraught with highly
nuanced racial and political implications. Thus it was
particularly disheartening to hear a number of visitors
dismiss it as an early instance of racial discrimination
against blacks, especially since in this case the catalog
entry and wall plaque duly noted the ambiguities inherent in
the picture. But unfortunately, the aggressively polemical
tone of the exhibition as a whole seems to have produced a
climate conducive to responses as unreasoning and prejudicial
as those that underlie racism itself.

   A Canadian truckers' protest, which stalled auto parts
from crossing the U.S.Canada border, idled nine Canadian auto
plants employing a total of 22,400 workers on Wednesday and
part of yesterday.
   The plants began reopening yesterday afternoon as auto
makers used alternative transportation -- including barges
and air shipments -- to move parts to Canada from the U.S.
"It looks like everything is getting back to normal," said a
spokesman for Ford Motor Co. of Canada, a subsidiary of Ford
Motor Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The protest, which blocked trucks from using Detroit's
Ambassador Bridge and various other border entry points, was
started late Tuesday night by Canadian truckers who said U.S.
trucking firms enjoyed an unfair advantage under the
U.S.-Canada Fair Trade Agreement.
   The protest affected more than the auto industry. An
estimated 300 trucks daily cross the border between Vermont
and Quebec Province, transporting forestry products, steel,
granite and other materials. Many of these trucks were forced
to use alternate routes after protestors temporarily stopped
trucks from using the two main highways crossing the border.
   Separately, the ten major U.S. auto makers reported that
all assembly facilities are scheduled to operate next week.
   The domestic car makers planned to build 136,786 cars this
week, down 7.8% from 148,363 a year ago.

   State Department Opposes AT&amp;T Plan
   To Use Intersputnik for Phone Traffic

   NEW YORK -- The U.S. State Department wants to disconnect
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s plan to use the Soviet
Intersputnik satellite system to carry phone traffic between
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.
   Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, in a May
14 letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Alfred Sikes, said AT&amp;T's proposal would violate
international policies among the U.S. and the 118 countries
-- including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies
and Japan -- that own the International Telecommunications
Satellite Organization (Intelsat).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   U.S. policy bars U.S. communications carriers from sending
public voice and data traffic over satellite networks other
than Intelsat's system.
   Mr. Eagleburger added that "insufficient foreign policy
reasons exist to deviate from applying the existing U.S.
separate systems policy to the AT&amp;T application."
   The FCC has yet to rule on AT&amp;T's request, but it is
doubtful the commission will buck the State Department's
finding.
   The use of Intersputnik is critical to AT&amp;T for several
reasons. The plan, which has been waiting for FCC and State
Department approval since last December, was a cornerstone of
a wider-ranging agreement signed earlier this month between
AT&amp;T and the Soviet Ministry of Communications that called
for the two to explore joint ventures in telecommunications
services, equipment manufacturing and research and
development.
   In addition, world-wide satellite capacity has grown tight
in recent years, and AT&amp;T and the Soviets wanted to use
Intersputnik to handle some of the voice and data
communications traffic that has increased 2 1/2 times between
the U.S. and the Soviet Union since 1987. What's more, Moscow
could pay for Intersputnik transmission service in rubles
much easier than paying for Intelsat service in Western
currency, which is scarce in the U.S.S.R.
   An AT&amp;T spokesman said the company had received favorable
reaction for its proposal to use Intersputnik from the State
Department's telecommunications policy experts. But a
spokesman at the State Department's Bureau of International
Communications and Information Policy declined to comment,
saying Mr. Eagleburger's letter speaks for itself and the
department's position. He added that "the department would
support an amended AT&amp;T application for use of Intersputnik"
for private communications traffic.
   Intersputnik is run by a consortium of 15 Socialist
countries, which it services exclusively. Those members use
Intelsat to communicate with nonmembers.
   AT&amp;T currently derives less than 1% of its $3.5 billion in
international communications revenue from the Soviet Union.
It planned to link its network with Intersputnik to provide
150 circuits to augment the 32 now being used between the two
countries and to build a satellite Earth station in Roaring
Creek, Pa., to link with the service. Intelsat provides 20 of
the 32 circuits; the other 12 are handled by underground and
undersea cables owned by AT&amp;T and numerous foreign
telecommunications authorities.
   Asked whether the State Department's decision on the
Intersputnik plan would hamper AT&amp;T's other projects with the
Soviets, Charles Miller, AT&amp;T vice president and liaison with
the State Department, said, "down the road it could. At this
point, we just don't know."

   British Phone Firm
   Sets Job Cuts' Cost
   At $660.7 Million

   LONDON -- British Telecommunications PLC set aside #390
million ($660.7 million) to pay for planned job cuts, part of
a wrenching reorganization aimed at making Britain's main
phone company more efficient.
   The extraordinary earnings charge, to finance job cuts of
about 10% over the next few years, prompted the deepest
plunge in British Telecom's quarterly and annual income since
1985. Net profit attributable to shareholders, roughly
equivalent to net income, tumbled 47% in the fourth quarter
ended March 31 to #195 million from #373 million a year
earlier. Before the charge, however, pretax profit rose 19%
to #684 million from #575 million, largely because of rising
British phone usage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The cuts are part of a corporate restructuring begun
recently called "Project Sovereign." Though British Telecom's
basic United Kingdom phone business is faring well, the
former government phone monopoly concedes it is overstaffed
and bureaucratic compared with all U.S. and some European
rivals. At the same time, British Telecom managers say they
fear getting sideswiped by increasing domestic competition
unless they cut costs now. By its own measure, said Chairman
Iain Vallance, British Telecom is 10% to 15% less efficient
than the U.S. regional telephone companies, and job cuts and
internal reorganization are needed to boost efficiency.
   "We've got some catching up to do," Mr. Vallance said at a
news conference. "We're going to step up the pace of change
at BT."
   Such comments are a marked change from British Telecom's
former complacency and follow a series of management shuffles
in the past few months that have increased the tough-minded
Mr. Vallance's power inside the company. Mr. Vallance said he
expects to cut British Telecom's 246,000-member work force by
roughly 10,000 annually over the next two to three years,
partly by attrition and partly by offering older employees
early retirement. The first step in those cuts was announced
a few weeks ago, when the company said it plans to reduce its
40,000-member management staff by between 4,000 and 5,000
this year.
   London financial analysts said even deeper job cuts than
the 10,000-a-year rate may eventually be needed, but the
announced pace is as fast as British Telecom can go without
provoking labor or political strife. "If they had announced
40,000 to 50,000 {job cuts}, they might have had mass union
action," said analyst Tim Hirst of London-based Smith New
Court Securities PLC. Three years ago, a relatively minor
company attempt to alter inefficient work practices ended in
a costly, weeks-long strike by its blue-collar workers.
   London stock traders greeted the announcements cautiously.
Though Mr. Hirst said the job cuts make "a very good
beginning" for the company's cost-cutting program, British
Telecom shares fell two pence to 276 pence in late trading on
London's stock exchange.
   Partly motivating the British Telecom moves is its
managers' growing tendency to measure their company against
the seven U.S. regional telephone companies. Indeed, Mr.
Vallance hired as his strategy chief a former manager at one
of those companies, U S West Inc. Soon, London analysts say,
British Telecom may find itself competing directly with those
companies in the British market.
   In recent months, several U.S. regional operators have
quietly invested in British cable-television franchises. Some
British Telecom officials say they expect them eventually to
try using their cables as telephone wires, thereby competing
directly with British Telecom.
   If that happens, British Telecom may be in big trouble
unless it boosts efficiency. It has, for instance, 92.7
employees for every 10,000 telephone lines, compared to 49.1
employees per 10,000 lines at the average U.S. regional phone
company, according to a recent study by Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. The reason is largely historical. Before its 1984
privatization British Telecom couldn't get enough cash to
modernize its antiquated phone network. Now it is installing
new equipment that needs fewer workers to tend it -- but that
modernization program will take most of the decade to
complete.

   Small Businesses Say They Don't Feel Credit Crunch
   ---
   Survey by Trade Group Finds Little
   Change in Availability of Funds

   WASHINGTON -- A dispute has broken out over a crucial
question for entrepreneurs: Is a credit crunch really
striking small business?
   Contrary to expectations, a National Federation of
Independent Business survey found small companies generally
weren't finding it tougher to get loans than it was last
fall. The survey by the nation's largest small-business trade
group covered 2,300 such businesses, mainly very small
concerns employing a few dozen workers or less.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But more than half the banks surveyed recently by the
Federal Reserve say they have tightened standards for lending
to small and medium-sized businesses in recent months. These
banks cite concern over the economy -- and the health of
their own loan portfolios.
   The NFIB survey showed little change in the availability
of credit between last October and last month. In the survey,
the "net percent" of business owners who say credit is harder
to obtain than in the previous quarter increased to only 8%
in April from 6% in January. (The study defines net
percentage as the share of respondents who said it was harder
to get credit minus the share who said it was easier.)
   "For now, the credit crunch is more smoke than fire,
though the smoke is thick enough to warrant a watchful eye,"
the NFIB survey concluded.
   NFIB President John Sloan called the credit-crunch "only a
rumor" a few days before the Federal Reserve Survey was
released. Yesterday, the group's chief economist, William
Dunkelberg, said the term "credit crunch" still overstates
what's going on nationally.
   "We're concerned about credit availability," said Mr.
Dunkelberg, who is also dean of Temple University's School of
Business in Philadelphia. "We're seeing more careful
documentation, more jumping through hoops and wailing and
gnashing of teeth to satisfy the comptroller of the currency,
but not necessarily a striking shift in availability. Once
you've done all your work, the credit's still there."
   The Federation does agree with reports from other groups
that businesses in the Northeast, the Southwest and those in
the real estate industry are having trouble getting
financing. But they also note that loan demand is down in
much of the country because economic activity is flat.
   Some say company size accounts for much of the discrepancy
between the NFIB survey and other studies. One-third of the
NFIB sample had annual revenue of less than $200,000, while
the bank survey focused on businesses with sales from $50
million to $250 million. Only 35% of those in the latest NFIB
survey classified themselves as "regular borrowers."
   A Federal Reserve economist said the NFIB study might not
have shown businesses were having difficulty getting credit
if those in the survey hadn't tried to get additional credit
or change the conditions of their loans recently. (He also
noted that most of the Federal Reserve banks indicated they
only had tightened lending policies somewhat rather than
severely.)
   Very small businesses "use so little credit that they
aren't affected" by the credit crunch, says Donald Lawhorne,
a Dallas venture capitalist. But many of the 55 companies in
his portfolio -- considerably bigger concerns than those in
the NFIB sample -- continue to have a difficult time with
lenders, he adds.
   Mr. Lawhorne says lenders continue to ask for greater
documentation, higher equity requirements and increased
collateral. The loan covenants are restrictive. "Things
haven't improved in the last year, they've gotten worse," he
says.
   Alamo Technologies Inc., a San Antonio maker of electronic
testing equipment and one of Mr. Lawhorne's portfolio
companies, couldn't get working capital after its troubled
local lender was acquired by an out-of-state bank.
   Alamo, which has annual sales of $4 million and is
profitable, had paid back by the end of last year more than
half of a $660,000 loan it received in 1986. But when it
applied for a new $400,000 loan to pay vendors on a $12.6
million Defense Department contract, the bankers said no.
   Alamo's chief executive, Doroteo Chavarria, is now turning
to financial factors for capital. Using factors -- companies
that buy accounts receivable -- is costly. But Mr. Chavarria
says: "It's the only way I can stay in business. I am going
to ride this wave and hope that things will improve."
   Others report signs of mounting trouble. "We're not just
in a credit crunch, we're in a credit crisis," says Jo Ann
Price, president of the National Association of Investment
Companies. She says entrepreneurs are now returning to
investment companies two and three times for loans, rather
than simply asking them for early-stage financing.
   "Our investment should make a company a bankable deal, but
it doesn't happen," she says. "We're there until the end
because so many companies can't get bank financing." She says
many of the companies having problems have about a million
dollars in annual sales and aim for sales between $5 million
and $15 million.
   The National Association of Manufacturers didn't find its
smaller concerns were in a credit pinch when it did a survey
in January and February. Sixty-two percent of the
manufacturers said their difficulty in getting credit hadn't
changed and many said they were trying to decrease their
debt. "But in March and April, we started to hear from people
that there's a problem," says Christian Braunlich, director
of the smaller manufacturers forum.
   Problems may be worse than they appear, too. "Companies
are reluctant to come forward," says John Galles, executive
vice president of National Small Business United. "They don't
want to tell their suppliers that they're short of cash and
they don't want other banks to know they're in a crunch."
   According to Michael Knight, a Fairfield, Conn.,
accountant, small businesses find banks in the area are
setting conditions that are impossible to meet. "Many of the
local banks will tell you there's plenty of money but when
you go to them, they won't respond," he says. One client, a
local provider of security services, asked a local bank for
an $80,000 loan three weeks ago. "They won't even return our
calls," Mr. Knight says.
   H-R Industries Inc., Richardson, Texas, says it found
lenders willing to finance expansion of its Midwest
operation, but couldn't get $250,000 to expand its hometown
manufacturing facilities.
   H-R, which manufactures double-sided, printed circuit
boards for communications and computer makers, says it has
annual sales of over $10 million and is profitable. When it
wanted the $250,000 loan, lenders conducted a new audit and
increased the valuation of the company assets by $500,000 --
but still wouldn't lend the additional amount, says Michael
Strathmeyer, chief financial officer. "They said that the
business conditions didn't warrant the loan," he adds.
   Mr. Strathmeyer now is obtaining the necessary capital
from a group of venture capitalists but says that the new
money, at a 14%-15% interest rate plus a stake in the
company, could raise his total cost of capital sharply.
   John Robinson, president and chief executive of the
National Minority Business Council, says members found
long-term loans getting harder to obtain even six months ago.
But now, the crunch has extended to shorter-term loans and
working capital requirements, he adds. With the economic
outlook cloudy, prospects for an improvement look bleak, he
says.

   MONROE, Conn. -- Taunton Technologies Inc. and VISX Inc.
said they signed a definitive agreement to merge.
   Under the planned merger, which has been approved by the
boards of both companies, one share of Taunton stock will be
issued for each 1.3597 shares of VISX outstanding, resulting
in VISX shareholders' owning about 32% of the combined
company. The planned merger is subject to shareholder
approval.

   The companies said Charles R. Munnerlyn, chairman and
chief executive officer of VISX, which is based in Sunnyvale,
Calif., will become chairman and chief executive of the
combined companies. Alan R. McMillen, current president of
VISX, will become president. John W. Warner, current chief
executive of Taunton, will consult on the evaluation of
products, patents and technology for the combined companies.
   Officials of both companies said that the merger would
result in the termination of patent litigation between the
companies. Taunton and VISX had been engaged in interference
proceedings over rights to patents for the use of lasers to
correct nearsightedness and other eye disorders.
   Taunton said it expects VISX shareholders to receive about
2.5 million shares of the combined company valued at about
$27 million. Shares of Taunton closed yesterday on the
national over-the-counter market at $11 bid.

   Houston -- The Astrodome here passed its 25th birthday
this year, and it would be nice if, sometime during the
annum, we each light a sparkler to mark it.
   I suggest a sparkler not only because it would be festive,
but also because the device has a place in Astrodome history.
In the indoor ballpark's earlier days, its humongous
electronic scoreboard would erupt into a lengthy and
excessive display every time a Houston Astro hit a home run.
This prompted some opposing players to light sparklers in
countercelebration of their teammates' four-baggers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The big scoreboard is gone, removed in a recent expansion
of the Dome's seating capacity. Gone, too, is the apartment
its creator, Judge Roy Hofheinz, maintained in the upper deck
behind right-center field, the presidential suite he built
for his pal, Lyndon B. Johnson (but which LBJ never
occupied), and the medieval-style chapel he installed in case
guests felt the need for prayer or meditation.
   The presidential suite was a special stunner. Designed by
Harper Goff, whose previous credits included sets for the
movie "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," it featured
chandeliers, statuary, a rug bearing the presidential seal,
and canopied twin beds covered in regal purple. Once asked if
the effect wasn't a bit gaudy, the late judge is said to have
replied, "Maybe, but you'll remember it, won't you?"
   Much the same thing can be said for the Astrodome as a
whole. You don't hear much about its being the "eighth wonder
of the world" anymore, now that Toronto and Montreal boast
indoor ballparks with roofs that retract, but the place's
place as a pacesetter will ever be secure. It was the first
domed and air-conditioned baseball-football stadium, the
first to sport an artificial playing surface, and the first
to have corporate "luxury suites." When Houston's
rank-and-file fans didn't rise up and murder their occupants,
the suites became the bedrock of new-stadium financing.
   "Whether you like it or not, we're in show business,"
declared the judge in 1965, when his brainchild opened. And
American sports have never been the same since.
   Judge Hofheinz, stout and bespectacled, was a prototypical
Texas politician-entrepreneur who titled his autobiography
"The Grand Huckster." He first envisaged an indoor stadium
for his sultry home town, a city of shiny skyscrapers and
shinier foreheads, after visiting the Colosseum in Rome and
learning that the structure once had a huge "velarium," or
awning, that could be unrolled in inclement weather.
   He discussed the matter with the architect Buckminster
Fuller, inventor of the geodesic dome, and came away
convinced "that it was possible to cover any size space if
you don't run out of money." The Astrodome cost $36.5
million, which was a lot then but not so much now; the
1988-89 remodeling job cost about $50 million.
   The Dome was a hit at first, drawing 2,151,470 spectators
to Astro games its initial season, triple the number of the
year before, and thousands more for tours to view its
splendors. Judge Hofheinz branched out on the site, building
convention facilities, hotels and an amusement park, all with
"Astro" in their names. His Astro-naming craze extended to an
early baseball program, which provided fans with space to
collect "Astrografs."
   Astromania would be shortlived. When the novelty of the
Dome wore off, Houston proved to be a tough-nut sports town,
and sellouts remain rare even for the pro-football Oilers. In
the middle 1970s, with seasonal baseball attendance below the
one million mark, the Hofheinz empire unraveled, and
creditors had to step in for a time and operate his
properties.
   The Dome's, and the Astros', current proprietor is the
Houston Sports Association, which leases the building from
Harris County. It books about 200 dates a year with things
like rodeos and tractor pulls in addition to baseball and
football, and usually runs close to breaking even, no small
achievement for an enterprise of its sort.
   "September baseball is our key -- if the Astros are
playing well, they'll draw enough people to put us in the
black," says Adam Richards, HSA's treasurer. Since the team's
second and last National League Western Division title, in
1986, they have, he adds.
   Withal, the Astrodome has stood up well during its first
quarter-century. Its seats for baseball, its main activity,
are comfortable and close to the field, and parking is
plentiful and cheap ($3). Dome management courts the family
trade by keeping the place tidy and leveling a close eye on
rowdies. "First, we ask 'em to hold it down, and if they
don't, we ask 'em to leave," notes Gary Weaver, one of the
building's red-jacketed security men.
   If there have been complaints about the building, they've
come mainly from ballplayers, not fans. Whatever else the
Astrodome may be, it's also the toughest park in the National
League in which to hit home runs. During the 1980s, just 702
batted balls cleared the fences here, fewer than half as many
as at Chicago's Wrigley Field, the league's most-generous
venue.
   "A lot of awfully hard-hit balls wind up as simple
fly-outs here. It can get really frustrating," says Glen
Davis, the reigning Astro strong boy, who has hit more homers
on the road than at home over his five-year career. His
theory is that sea-level Houston's hot and soggy summer air
overpowers the Dome's air-conditioning and stifles potential
round-trippers.
   It's been said that the Dome's cushioned seats and
decorous atmosphere, coupled with the prevailing
power-hitting failure, has created a laid-back local fandom
that's been less than an asset to Astro teams. "Some players
used to say it was more like a theater than a ballpark, and
that makes it tough to get up for games," notes Larry
Dierker, who pitched for the Astros for 14 years and now is
one of the team's broadcasters.
   He adds, "I never agreed with that view, but sure I
understood it. Heck, the place is more like a theater than a
ballpark."

   TOKYO -- Four major Japanese electronics companies -- Sony
Corp., Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. -- announced strongly higher earnings for the
fiscal year ended March 31. But some companies were cautious
about the current fiscal year, saying growth rates are likely
to ease.
   Sony said pretax group profit surged 37% to a record
227.43 billion yen ($1.5 billion), from 165.52 billion yen
the year before. Net profit climbed 42% to 102.81 billion
yen, also a record, or 306.87 yen per share, from 72.47
billion yen, or 241.72 yen per share, the year before.
Revenues rose 34% to a record 2.88 trillion yen ($18.4
billion) from 2.15 trillion yen the year before. The dividend
for the year rose 5.4 yen per share to 50 yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sony said strong world economic growth and its marketing
successes contributed to the showing, which it noted would
have been even better without the costs connected with its
November purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   Sales rose 19% in Japan to 869.48 billion yen from 731.3
billion yen, 46% in the U.S. to 857.81 billion yen from
586.28 billion yen, and 44% in Europe to 715.42 billion yen
from 497.84 billion yen.
   But Sony predicted that in the current fiscal year, growth
in sales would slow to about 20% and in profits to about 12%.
   Toshiba reported a 15% increase in group pretax profit, to
269.74 billion yen from 234.83 billion yen, on a healthy 12%
gain in sales. Group net for the year rose 10% to a record
131.84 billion yen, from 119.40 billion yen, while group
sales increased to a record 4.252 trillion yen, from 3.801
trillion yen.
   Company officials expected continuing robust growth for
the company, especially in sales of telecommunications
products and semiconductors, including one-megabit dynamic
random access memory, or DRAM, chips. "We believe the market
{for semiconductors} hit bottom at the beginning of this
year, and therefore we see conditions tightening up and
demand rising," a spokesman said.
   Hitachi, Japan's biggest manufacturer of electric
machinery, said pretax group earnings rose 7.9% to 529.99
billion yen from 491.11 billion yen, owing to strong demand
for computers, industrial machinery and some other products.
   Net climbed 14% to 210.96 billion yen, or 61.71 yen a
share, from 185.59 billion yen, or 56.14 yen a share. Sales
surged 11% to 7.077 trillion yen, from 6.401 trillion yen.
   Hitachi plans to pay a special two-yen dividend to
commemorate the 80th anniversary of its founding, or a total
of 11 yen, up from the previous year's nine yen.
   Overall, officials said, strong personal spending and
corporate investment in plant and equipment fueling the
present 42-month economic expansion were behind their
company's healthy earnings results. They said foreign sales
climbed 13% to 1.657 trillion yen.
   In the current fiscal year, they added, a booming domestic
economy will continue to sustain sales and earnings, though
they added economic conditions overseas are difficult to
foresee, with changes sweeping Europe and the possibilities
of renewed trade tensions lingering.
   Matsushita Electric, one of the world's largest consumer
electronics makers, posted a 7.9% rise in consolidated pretax
profit, to 571.73 billion yen from 529.45 billion yen in
fiscal 1989.
   Operating profit rose 8.5% to 452.72 billion yen from
417.19 billion yen, and net rose 10% to 235.56 billion yen,
or 108.34 yen a share, from 213.46 billion yen, or 99.94 yen
a share. Sales rose 9% to 6.002 trillion yen, a record, from
5.504 trillion yen. The company cited increased Japanese and
overseas demand for its broadening lines of electric and
electronics products.
   The company predicts increases to slow this year to 6.6%
in both sales and net income.

   Largest Issues Ease by 1.74%

   NEW YORK -- Short interest among smaller over-the-counter
stocks dropped 25.9% in the month ended mid-May, giving back
nearly all of the increase a month earlier.
   Meanwhile, short interest among the OTC market's largest
stocks continued to ease, slipping 1.74%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The short interest in several computer stocks dropped
significantly, including Intel. The short position in the
Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker plummeted 73.6%
after last month's 64.8% rise. Short positions also fell more
than 50% in Softsel Computer Products, Inglewood, Calif., and
Conner Peripherals, San Jose, Calif. On the other hand, the
short interest in Oracle Systems, Belmont, Calif., rose
57.2%.
   Nordstrom led the list of companies with the largest
increase in the number of shares sold short. Short interest
in the Seattle retailer surged 104.52% to 2.66 million of
Nordstrom 81.6 million outstanding shares.
   First Executive, the Los Angeles life insurance company
that once held a large portfolio of junk bonds, retained its
lead with a short position of 10.4 million shares. In distant
second place was Valley National Corp., a Phoenix, Ariz.,
commercial bank, with a short position of 4.2 million shares.
   Several other financial issues surfaced on lists
indicating large volume or percentage increases in short
interest, among them: BayBanks, Boston; Bank South, Atlanta;
Washington Bancorp., Washington, D.C.; SouthTrust Corp.,
Birmingham, Ala.; and Great Bay Bankshares, Dover, N.H.
   To sell short, traders borrow shares and sell them in
hopes the stock's price will decline so they can buy back the
shares later more cheaply. Short interest is the number of
shares that haven't yet been purchased for return to lenders.
   Although a substantial short position reflects heavy
speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors
consider an increase in short interest bullish because the
borrowed shares eventually must be bought back. Some short
interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the stock at all but
shows up as part of another strategy, such as arbitrage or
dividend capture.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory agency for the OTC markets, reported that
short interest in 2,338 National Market System issues, the
largest OTC stocks, slid to 248,818,151 shares at mid-May
from 253,218,788 in mid-April among 2,346 shares.
   Short interest in 1,301 smaller securities traded on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations system fell to 31,671,000 shares for May, down
from 42,790,704 for April among 1,252 issues.
   The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-May fell to 2.59 from 2.69 a month earlier, while the
short-interest ratio for other OTC issues dropped to 0.9 from
1.24 a month earlier.
   The ratio is the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position. It is considered
by many a measure of negative sentiment. Some analysts
suggest, however, that the ratio has weakened in value as an
indicator because options and other investment products can
be used to hedge short positions.
   The adjacent tables show the National Market System issues
in which a short position of at least 50,000 shares on May 15
or in which the short position had changed by at least 25,000
shares from mid-April (see accompanying tables -- WSJ May 25,
1990).

   Fun and Facts Fly Across Phone Lines
   As the Market for `Audiotex' Explodes

   The information revolution, ushered in by the personal
computer, has been hijacked by the telephone.
   While the boom in videotex information services delivered
by PC keeps receding into the future, the market for
information and entertainment services delivered via
telephone lines has exploded, with analysts predicting growth
rates of 40% or more over the next five years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The range of telephone-information services is limited
only by the entrepreneurial imagination. Most are toll-free
800 numbers or 900 numbers, for which callers pay. There are
services that virtually everyone has called at least once,
such as time, weather or sports numbers. Adult and chat lines
are commonplace and profitable, too, although analysts say
their use is now declining.
   But the variety of services that can be easily accessed
simply by poking numbers and letters on a touch-tone phone
goes much further. Is your diet center's appetite for cash
hard to swallow? Call the USA-DIET line and a computerized
voice will direct you to punch in personal information on
your age, height, weight and medical history before
delivering a custom diet plan for about $30 a month. Tired of
arguing with the know-it-all next door over the outcome of an
old boxing match? Button his lips by calling Boxing Line and
having him listen to the bout's blow-by-blow as it was
recorded 40 years ago.
   Brokerage firms and banks, many having abandoned attempts
to serve customers using home computers, are beginning to
offer account information and even transaction services by
telephone. Newspapers are augmenting printed information with
quick updates via phone. And advertisers are beginning to use
the new lines to promote their products.
   There's even a line that tells you how to set up a line.
Call 900-USA-INFO and a recording by W. Brooks McCarty, who
runs a one-man company called Information 900 Service Corp.,
based in New York, will tell you how. It costs about $12 for
the average 11 minutes it takes to get the information. Mr.
McCarty has also designed a system that will set up a
customer's program at no upfront charge, although he keeps 20
cents on each call that's made to the number. "I can take
your order, run it through my system and have you operating
by tomorrow," he says.
   With much of the telephone-information business --
commonly referred to as audiotex -- still in private hands,
its size is hard to gauge. But Link Resources Corp., a New
York research firm, says that phone company revenue alone
from carrying telephone-information traffic will grow 54% to
$825 million next year from $550 million in 1990. By 1994,
revenue will hit $1.5 billion, says Stephen Reynolds, Link's
voice information services analyst.
   But that estimate includes only calls to 900 numbers. It
doesn't cover revenue that programming companies take in. Nor
does it include revenue from local information services such
as weather lines and toll-free or sponsor-paid 800 calls,
advertising and promotional services or even equipment sales.
   Meanwhile, the videotex market, led in particular by
Prodigy Service Co., a joint venture of International
Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., had revenue
totaling $234 million last year and is growing about 25% a
year, says Mr. Reynolds.
   "All the projections suggest that {audiotex} is going to
be a very big medium," says Andy Fraser, Saatchi North
America's executive vice president and director of business
development. "Of course, we're looking at it."
   Andrea West, national marketing manager for American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph's MultiQuest audiotex transmission
services, sees the telephone-services market maturing: "In
the past six months, we've seen a shift in the market from
sheer entertainment programs to things like hot lines for
software customers, magazine subscriptions and travel lines
from companies such as Avis and the airlines."
   Companies are using 900 and 800 numbers to promote new
products and conduct surveys. Teleline Inc., a voice
information services company, is working with Japan's Isuzu
to set up a line that would promote its cars and trucks --
and be entertaining enough that consumers would be willing to
pay for the call. Callers would dial chronic fibber "Joe
Isuzu" for the lie of the day. "Let's say the advertiser gets
45 cents per call," says Robert A. Lorsch, Teleline's
president. "If 15,000 calls come in a day, that's $6,750 a
day, or $209,250" after a month. At that rate, which Mr.
Lorsch says is about the number of calls he would expect the
line to generate, income from the calls would pay for
promotion of the phone line. In other words, the campaign
would pay for itself.
   Audiotex also can be an extremely accurate
target-marketing tool. Callers' phone numbers,
computer-matched with addresses from directory data bases,
can be used to draw up a profile of customers and their
buying habits, or as a mailing list of consumers who have
already shown an interest in a company or its products.
   In the proposed Isuzu campaign, for instance, dealers
might get the name and phone number of the caller and reply
with a thank you and an offer to test drive an Isuzu. "You
can target the customer so directly," Mr. Lorsch says.
   Marketers also see big potential for 900 numbers in
billing. A customer would order something -- a magazine
subscription, for instance -- and the bill would appear on
his monthly telephone bill. The stumbling block is liability.
Phone companies are wary of being held responsible if a
service or good is delivered late or damaged.
   Things weren't supposed to turn out quite this way. The
computer industry had high hopes customers would use PCs and
modems hooked up to phone lines to bank from home, order
airline tickets and play games. But "many videotex services
require you to become a junior computer weenie," says
Mitchell Kapor, chairman of On Technology Inc. and founder of
software giant Lotus Development Corp. "The phone is
brainlessly simple to operate."
   Companies such as Citibank and Northern Telecom Inc. have
phones with screens attached to them that combine the simple
touch-tone pad with a small computer screen to facilitate
order entry and other interactive communications services.
AT&amp;T is said to be working on a similar audiotex phone.
   Some computer industry experts think audiotex could
actually help develop the videotex market by introducing
customers to electronic information services. But aside from
the simplicity of using the phone, videotex lacks a network
comparable to the nation's phone system. Mr. Kapor adds that
the computer industry is hobbled by networking problems that
prevent users on one videotex system from communicating with
PCs on other systems.
   Also retarding videotex are start-up costs. A new phone
information service can get started for as little as $50,000,
including writing and recording the program, hiring the
talent and advertising, says Mr. Lorsch.
   A recent study of audiotex users by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising, New York, shows they differ from nonusers not by
age or background but by "their ego structures," says Doreen
Doell, vice president and associate research director at
Saatchi. Users have "a fear of the unknown related to wanting
and needing to know what the future holds. For these people
the anxiety becomes overwhelming." The challenge, she said,
is for advertisers and their clients to create this
overwhelming desire among nonusers, who consider the lines
frivolous and associate them with porn lines and chat
services.
   The audiotex industry has already formed its own National
Association For Information Services to police itself against
marketing abuses before regulators step in. Phone companies,
excluding long-distance carriers, by law can't own the
information they transport over their networks and they must
give any information provider access to their public
networks. But some, including AT&amp;T, put many of the adult
lines out of business when they stopped providing billing
services to the lines.
   Don't bury the adult lines yet, however. After AT&amp;T's
move, the more resourceful providers simply switched their
numbers to toll-free 800 lines and let Visa and MasterCard do
their billing.

   Newsweek magazine is about to begin printing
"personalized" magazines -- including different ads for
different types of subscribers -- following the lead of
archrival Time magazine.
   The national news weekly, a unit of Washington Post Co.,
is struggling like other major, mass-market magazines to draw
new advertising dollars during one of the worst ad slumps in
years. The specialized editions also are part of the
far-reaching plans by Newsweek's new regime of top executives
to "raise the profile of the magazine" against Time Warner
Inc.'s Time. Those plans include ad packages with Washington
Post's flagship newspaper and its television stations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Personalized editions are the latest weapons that
mass-market magazines such as Time and Newsweek can use to
compete with local newspapers and direct mail. The Newsweek
program, for example, will offer advertisers specially
printed editions that will reach only "recent movers,"
subscribers who have moved in the last 12 months, and senior
citizens. The personalized editions also can address
subscribers by name, or give them the address of a car
dealership or retail outlet nearest them, by using a special
binding process known as selective binding.
   Newsweek, the perennial No. 2 of the prestigious news
weeklies, has been battling toe-to-toe for decades with Time,
and its latest ad twist just ups the ante. Time was the first
major magazine to embrace personalized advertising: In
December, American Isuzu Motors ran personalized ads, talking
to subscribers by name and listing the nearest dealer, in
three Time Warner magazines. In April, Newsweek performed a
similar feat for the New England Volkswagen Dealers
Association, naming the closest dealer in 160,000 copies.
Newsweek plans to expand the program in June to other regions
of the country.
   Newsweek's plunge into personalized ads is just one of
several new ad packages it is readying to announce that draw
together the various media properties of its parent company.
Peter W. Eldredge, who joined Newsweek as U.S. publisher in
March, and Alan G. Spoon, appointed president of Newsweek in
September, outlined the new packages in an interview.
   "It's important that we have on our menu a variety of
possibilities for the advertiser," says Mr. Eldredge, who
before joining Newsweek had put together similar cross-media
packages for Rupert Murdoch's various News Corp. properties.
"Time {magazine} is putting these bells and whistles. So we
have to show we are more than a one-magazine company."
   One of the new packages, for example, will offer
advertisers a discount if they buy both time on the ABC Radio
networks and pages in Newsweek. Another ad package, to be
unveiled in three weeks, will offer a combination of pages in
Newsweek and the Washington Post. The package is geared to
attract financial, corporate-image and national-association
ads, which Newsweek has had trouble attracting on its own.
   Mr. Eldredge said that eventually the magazine also will
offer ad packages that include commercial time on the four
Post-Newsweek TV stations in Detroit, Miami, Hartford, Conn.,
and Jacksonville, Fla.
   The new packages come at a crucial time for Newsweek, as
well as the newsweeklies in general. Once the dominant
magazines in the industry, the news weeklies have lost their
editorial leadership to TV news, while losing ad revenue and
readers to special interest magazines. For example, News
Corp.'s Murdoch Magazines, which was experimenting with
launching a new weekly news magazine, has shelved plans to
enter the field. "The climate is not right," said Leslie
Hinton, Murdoch Magazines president.
   While advertisers have been intrigued by personalized
editions, some industry experts question whether personalized
ads are just a gimmick. For one thing, the special binding
practice is quite expensive. Even the newsweeklies concede
that only a small number of advertisers are interested at
this point. Because of the cost, some skeptics question
whether the practice will ever be widespread.
   Messrs. Spoon and Eldredge don't believe their new plans
will suddenly make Newsweek No. 1 in a field that also
includes the U.S. News &amp; World Report. In 1987, Newsweek was
forced to follow Time Warner's Max-Plan, an ad incentive
plan, with its own plan that also offered discounts to
advertisers. Newsweek's Match Plan fizzled and was phased
out.
   But Newsweek's new executives do hope to wrest some
momentum away from Time. While the magazine doesn't plan any
major changes in its editorial approach, it's increasing the
number of separate, special issues devoted to single topics.
Last fall, Newsweek published "The 21st Century Family,"
which carried 55 pages of ads. In June, Newsweek will publish
"The American Teenager" issue, followed by "Educating
America" in September.
   "We can't change things overnight," said Mr. Eldredge.
"But we can be more aggressive. One magazine {Time} can't
satisfy all of an advertiser's needs."
   Time magazine's recent innovations include a special issue
last fall on the 150th anniversary of the birth of
photography that was sold to a single sponsor, Eastman Kodak
Co. Other special issues are planned for this year, but
Time's U.S. publisher, Louis Weil III, wouldn't disclose what
those issues will contain.
   "They {Newsweek} are following some of the things we've
done, but we are always looking for new ways to help
advertisers," he said. "We want our advertisers to see us as
a marketing partner."

   TV VIEWING: The American Association of Advertising
Agencies, a trade organization, said a two-year investigation
has concluded that the decline in TV viewing as reported by
Nielsen is in large part accurate. The organization issued
the report following complaints by the TV networks that
Nielsen's figures under-report the number of TV viewers. But
it found no "systematic problems" with the Nielsen system.
"This evidence . . . leads us to recommend the industry
continue to use the {Nielsen} data as usual," it said.

   BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp. declared a quarterly
dividend of 31 cents, surprising some analysts who had been
anticipating a cut because of New England's embattled
economy.
   But the bank said that beginning with the next quarter,
its board would meet in the third month of the quarter,
instead of the second -- which has been its custom -- to
consider future dividends. The company explained that the
action would bring the "practice into line with other major
banks."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move, however, was seen by some as a cautionary
action, given the area's uncertain economic climate. "By
pushing it to the third month, it will clearly give the board
a better handle on the quarter's earnings and economic
outlook," said Gerard Cassidy, bank analyst for Tucker,
Anthony &amp; R.L. Day Inc.
   Mr. Cassidy, along with a few others, had thought the bank
might cut its dividend to preserve capital. "If the economy
continues on a decline we feel their numbers will reflect
that weakness," he added.
   For the first quarter, Bank of Boston reported net income
of $43.6 million, or 56 cents a share, less than half the
$89.1 million, or $1.23 a share, reported in the year-ago
period.
   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its
rating on approximately $450 million of the bank's debt to
Ba-1 from Baa-3 and the long-term deposits of its bank
subsidiaries to Baa-2 from Baa-1. The banks' ratings for
short-term deposits were confirmed at P-2.
   The rating actions reflect the continuing uncertainty
associated with the corporation's exposures to the New
England economy and the national real estate markets, Moody's
said.
   "Clearly, we are disappointed with the action taken today
by Moody's," Peter J. Manning, the bank's chief financial
officer said. "We remain steadfast in our focus on credit
quality . . . we have the financial strength and are well
positioned to deal with uncertainties in the current
environment."

   Hudson's Bay Co.
   Plans to Spin Off
   Real Estate Unit

   TORONTO -- Hudson's Bay Co., the 320-year-old retailing
concern that is 79%-owned by Kenneth Thomson and his family,
said it plans to spin off its real estate unit to
shareholders.
   Donald S. McGiverin, governor of Hudson's Bay, told the
annual meeting that the company's real estate assets, held
through its wholly owned unit, Markborough Properties Inc.,
weren't being properly valued in Hudson Bay's stock price.
The governor's title, similar to chairman and chief executive
officer, dates back to Hudson's Bay's origins in 1670, when
King Charles II of England granted a charter for trading into
Hudson's Bay.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders will be asked at a special meeting, scheduled
for July 26, to approve the spinoff, which also requires
court and regulatory approval. Terms weren't indicated.
   Neil Wood, chairman and president of Markborough, said its
properties have a pretax market value of 1.4 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.18 billion). He said the assets' market value
exceed book value by about C$1 billion.
   Mr. Thomson, chairman of Thomson Corp., and his family own
about 79% of Hudson's Bay's common shares through closely
held Woodbridge Co. After the meeting, Mr. Thomson said the
family would keep the roughly 79% stake it would end up with
in Markborough.
   "We like both companies," Mr. Thomson said. "We have no
intention of selling."
   Analysts viewed the spinoff favorably, citing a similar
decision by Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd. to spin off
as a dividend to shareholders its real estate unit, Marathon
Realty Co.
   "Much like Marathon and Canadian Pacific, you weren't
getting full value recognition for cash flow and real estate
value creation on the real estate end," said Ross Cowan, an
analyst at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.
   Though this isn't necessarily the best time to take a real
estate concern public, given declining North American real
estate markets, the planned spinoff is timely from a
retailing perspective, Mr. Cowan said. Hudson's Bay's
retailing operations have turned around in the past year,
after incurring heavy losses throughout most of the past
decade.
   In the year ended Jan. 31, Hudson's Bay earned C$168.2
million, or C$4.37 a share, compared with fiscal 1989 profit
of C$22.2 million, or, after dividends, a loss of 16 Canadian
cents a share.
   "If things hadn't improved, I'm sure we wouldn't have done
it," Mr. Thomson said of the spinoff plan.
   Merchandising operating profit at Hudson's Bay last year
rose C$87 million to C$314.6 million. George Kosich,
president and chief operating officer of Hudson's Bay, said
he expects that the stand-alone retailing company's operating
profit from merchandising in the current fiscal year will
grow at least C$44 million. Operating profit is defined as
earnings before interest, taxes, general corporate expenses
and extraordinary items.
   Mr. Kosich said Hudson's Bay will keep all the real estate
assets currently owned under its retailing divisions,
including major stores in city cores and its corporate head
office in downtown Toronto. Hudson's Bay has four retailing
divisions and annual sales totaling C$4.6 billion.
   Markborough, which was a public company from 1967 until
its acquisition by Hudson's Bay in 1978, had cash flow from
operations of C$61 million last year, on revenue of C$263.7
million. About three-fourths of its assets are
income-producing properties, and about 55% of its portfolio
is in Canada, while 38% is in the U.S. and the balance is in
Britain.

   HUDSON'S BAY Co.'s real estate subsidiary, Markborough
Properties Inc., estimates the market value of its properties
at 2.9 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.47 billion). An earlier
edition misstated the figure.

   Arms Control:
   Irrelevant at Best,
   Pernicious at Worst

   Secretary of State James Baker didn't get his reputation
for political aplomb for nothing. After a few hawks
criticized the arms-control deals he struck in Moscow last
week, Mr. Baker didn't sulk. He merely walked over to the
White House pressroom on Wednesday to say his critics have
"simply rejected the concept of arms control generally."
   Ouch, that hurt. OK, maybe not. (Richard Perle's been
called worse.) But it does point out how much the Bush
administration wants a nuclear arms-control agreement.
Whatever doubts Mr. Baker might first have had about
strategic arms reductions (START), he and Mr. Bush are now
converts. The open question is whether arms control is going
to turn out as well as the cheerful handshakes and
photographs at next week's Bush-Gorbachev summit will
advertise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In one sense, the Baker strategy is plausible enough. The
main U.S. interest now lies in getting the Soviets to swallow
a historic defeat in Europe. That means getting the Soviet
troops out and keeping Germany in NATO. Anything that
interferes with that goal, such as Lithuania or strategic
arms, is secondary. Why worry about details when the big
prize is in sight?
   But that strategy also depends on a cooperative Mikhail
Gorbachev. And suddenly he isn't cooperating. The string of
Soviet concessions that prevailed until April has stopped. On
the Baltics, on strategic arms, on Germany -- Mr. Baker
returned from Moscow empty-handed this weekend. It doesn't
take a right-winger to wonder if pre-emptive U.S. concessions
will make Mr. Gorbachev any more agreeable.
   That's especially true because once again arms control is
proving to be irrelevant when it's not pernicious. Though he
clearly intended otherwise, the list of Soviet "concessions"
that Mr. Baker offered on Wednesday more or less proves the
point.
   Mr. Baker said they've agreed to tear down their illegal
Krasnoyarsk radar, yet in fact they haven't begun to do it in
practice. The Soviets have separated strategic defense from
START, but they've also vowed to repudiate START if the U.S.
ever deploys SDI. Some concession. And, yes, the Soviets will
destroy 154 big missiles (SS-18s), but the 154 that remain
will be so much more accurate that they're just as capable as
the original 308. Somehow this doesn't sound like a great
triumph.
   As for U.S. concessions, administration hard-liners don't
have much to show for their work. In February, the Soviets
agreed to the U.S. position merely to "declare" how many
nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles each side would build.
In April, they took that back; and in Moscow last week, Mr.
Baker agreed to the Soviet offer that each side include a
limit of 880 sea cruises for the first time. While that's
more than the U.S. Navy wants now, the history of arms
control suggests that cruise missiles will be the next target
of congressional budget-cutters.
   None of this matters all that much if we're entering a new
era of U.S.-Soviet cooperation. But it does if we've reached
Mr. Gorbachev's bottom line on reform. The details are
obscure, absurdly so, but they won't remain that way if the
new Soviet hard-line persists. How will cruise-missile limits
look to the U.S. Senate if there's violence in Lithuania? If
the Soviets insist on a neutral Germany, maybe even the
"Backfire" bomber will become an issue again.
   William Cohen, the relentless moderate from Maine, could
dust off his tough speeches on that Soviet long-range bomber
from the late 1970s. Someone could leak the story about the
Soviet defector who says the Soviets are lying when they say
they can't refuel the Backfire. (He says they let Backfire
crews practice on Soviet Bear bombers so they won't be
detected.) Obscure, sure -- until Sam Nunn starts asking the
questions.
   The point is that the fate of a START treaty depends less
on the mind-numbing details than on the nature of Soviet-U.S.
relations. Arms control is an artifact of the Cold War, when
it reassured Americans that the two sides were talking. The
few deals that were struck succeeded largely because they
barely affected either side's strategic interests. Like
START, they were mostly symbolic.
   But with ideological rivalry supposedly behind us, who
needs more symbols? If the Soviets are really bent on
cooperation, they'll reduce their forces in Europe and
elsewhere for their own economic reasons. Talk to an American
negotiator long enough, and he'll concede that even the
Soviets don't care all that much about START anymore.
   So why pursue START at all? The answer is politics. The
public retains a vague hope that agreements somehow make war
less likely, and politicians are only too happy to oblige by
signing agreements. With the Soviet hard-line on the Baltics
and Germany, Messrs. Bush and Baker want something to show
next week at what George Bush once said would be the "arms
control summit." A "historic" arms pact fits the bill. It's
the world's best photo-op.
   In cabinet-level meetings on START, Mr. Baker has rebutted
a rival's tougher proposal by saying, "I can't take that to
Shevardnadze," referring to the Soviet foreign minister.
Inside the administration, that usually ends the debate. To
satisfy critics outside, he'll still need to get the Soviets
out of Europe.

   Committees Approve
   Revised Revamp Plan

   NEW YORK -- Resorts International Inc.'s debtholder
committees approved a revised reorganization plan with terms
slightly sweeter than outlined in a plan the company filed in
April.
   The hotel-casino company, which entered bankruptcy-law
proceedings last December, plans to file the revisions to the
plan with the bankruptcy court next Thursday. Resorts has
said it expects to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings by
summer's end. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from
creditors while it seeks to work out a plan for paying its
debts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The revisions essentially kept intact the April plan,
which calls for the swap of a total of about $930 million of
debt. The latest plan continues to give debtholders a 78%
equity stake in the company. Merv Griffin, Resorts' chairman,
who paid $365 million for the company in a leveraged buy-out,
will keep a 22% equity stake and would name a majority of the
board.
   The revised plan essentially speeds up interest payments
on about $187.5 million of senior secured notes and increases
the principal amount on new 10-year debentures by about $5
million. In addition, Mr. Griffin would increase the cash
infusion he would make to $28.5 million from $26 million in
exchange for cancellation of a $50 million note his Griffin
Co. owed to Resorts.
   The reorganization plan would leave the company with total
debt of $430.3 million. Resorts will be responsible for
payment of about $325 million of that amount; the other $100
million will come from rental payments on the lease held in
Showboat Hotel &amp; Casino in Atlantic City.
   A spokesman for Resorts said the company believes it has
the necessary votes to win approval for the plan. Holders of
two-thirds of the value of the bonds and 50% of the
bondholders are required for approval.
   Balfour Investors Inc., a major bondholder that isn't
represented by the committees, is said to favor the plan. The
Resorts spokesman said the company won't try to sell its
Paradise Island property in the Bahamas until the plan is
approved by debtholders.

   R.H. Macy Bond Prices Fall as Concern
   About Its Financial Condition Increase

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Prices of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. bonds dropped as
much as 8% as the credit markets and the retailing industry
were swept by rising concerns about the giant retailer's
financial condition.
   Heller Financial Corp., a major lender to Macy suppliers,
said it will review its standards for financing shipments to
the chain. An executive at another major credit company, who
declined to be identified, said his firm has tightened its
standards on Macy shipments. Several bank lenders also voiced
concern about Macy, which has over $5 billion in debt
following its 1986 buy-out by management.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Macy spokesman insisted the company's financial
condition is sound, and several key suppliers said they are
continuing to ship new merchandise. "We're watching
developments, and yes, everybody is nervous, but we are
shipping as usual," said Jerome Chazen, chairman of Liz
Claiborne Inc., Macy's largest supplier. "We've checked with
both our factoring companies, and they have given us a green
light."
   Factoring companies like Heller play a critical role in
the retailing business by extending credit to suppliers.
Without approval from factors, most vendors won't ship new
goods. Should the factors lose confidence in Macy, it would
put the store in a serious situation. The recent
bankruptcy-law filings of L.J. Hooker Corp. and Campeau
Corp.'s retailing operations reflected in part a loss of
faith by factors.
   The head of one major factoring company, who asked not to
be identified, said he hasn't seen any material change in
Macy's business to indicate Macy's prospects have changed in
the last few months. The head of a second major factoring
firm said that his firm is approving Macy shipments through
the end of May but will want to review all June and July
shipments before they are sent. "We have to be prudent," said
this executive, who asked not to be identified.
   "The idea is to stay calm," said Jon Levy, president of
St. Gilliam Inc., a women's apparel vendor which does
business with Macy. "If the factors panic now, everybody will
panic."
   Henry Kassebaum, a Heller executive vice president, said
Heller isn't cutting its credit lines to Macy suppliers but
will review those lines when they expire at the end of this
month. Mr. Kassebaum said Heller has approved all of Macy's
orders thus far. Separately, he told the Dow Jones News
Service that Heller has shifted from a "revolving credit"
policy toward Macy suppliers to an "order-by-order" policy.
   The bankruptcy-law filings in the last year by Hooker,
Campeau's retailing operations and Ames Department Stores
Inc. have made investors skittish about the least sign of
difficulty at another retailer -- particularly one with a big
debt load and high-yield "junk" bonds. The Ames filing last
month, which caught some manufacturers by surprise, has left
the apparel industry especially jittery.
   Yesterday, Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures
due 1998 finished the day at 69 cents on the dollar, down 7%
from the day before. Its 14 1/2% subordinated debentures due
2001 were quoted at 59 cents on the dollar, down 5%. The
biggest percentage drop was shown by Macy's zero-coupon
bonds, which finished the day at 24 cents on the dollar, off
8%.
   Macy executives declined to be interviewed, but a
spokesman said the company is meeting its financial
projections and has arranged to meet next week with eight to
10 factoring companies to update them on its financial
status.
   Earlier this week, Macy provided some factors with updated
forecasts reflecting results for the close of the third
quarter ended April 28. "That information was even more
favorable than had been forecast in February," said the
spokesman.
   Although Macy hasn't yet reported its third-quarter
results, the company has indicated its losses were less than
the $64 million it reported during the same period in 1989.
For the second quarter, which included Christmas results,
Macy reported a $39 million loss.
   Macy may face some friction with its bank lenders, who
provided $735 million of loans for the company's 1986
buy-out. When the banks lent the money, they set financial
targets for Macy, one of which the company recently has
failed to meet.
   Macy in July will likely seek a further six-month waiver
of a condition that its cash flow -- net income plus interest
expense, taxes and depreciation -- exceed its annual interest
expense by 1.55:1. Bankers have already voted one such waiver
for Macy in March, allowing it to meet a less-stringent 1.2:1
ratio.
   But some bankers don't appear in the mood to grant Macy
further waivers, unless they get concessions in return. One
major European lender said he would like to see Macy sell
assets, such as its credit-card company, so that it can pay
off its bank debt more quickly.
   "We're concerned about the retail trade," said George
Morgan, a top lender at U.S. National Bank of Oregon, which
helped finance the buy-out. "If a credit isn't performing to
expectations, you're probably entitled to some compensation."
   Macy's lead bank, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., has been
telling lenders that Macy has ample borrowing capacity to
cover its needs this year.
   Arnold Cohen, president of Mahoney Cohen Paul &amp; Co., the
apparel industry's largest accounting firm, said he is
suggesting clients be cautious in dealing with Macy. "I'm
asking the healthy businesses to find a number that they are
willing to invest in this situation in the hopes that it will
work out. Companies which are in weak condition can't afford
another writeoff."
   Richard Posner, executive vice president of Credit
Exchange Inc., a source of credit information for apparel
manufacturers, said he is telling clients to sit tight until
he meets with Macy executives. "We want to talk to the
company," said Mr. Posner. Both Solo Credit Service Corp. and
Bernard Sands Credit Consultants Inc. continue to recommend
Macy shipments.
   Some apparel executives suggested the recent concern about
Macy may be related to the shipping and payment practices in
the retailing business. Typically stores pay vendors on the
tenth of the month for goods shipped 20 to 50 days earlier.
On June 10, Macy is expected to pay its bills on merchandise
shipped between April 20 and May 20. But it won't have to pay
for goods shipped between May 21 and June 20 before July 10.
   "The question is whether you want to extend them credit
for what amounts to 50 days," said Bud Konheim, president of
Nicole Miller Ltd., an apparel maker. "Recent experiences
tell me that where there is smoke, there's fire."

   Zero-Coupon
   $1.5 Billion Sale

   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. is tapping its
financial imagination to help pay for the multibillion-dollar
expansion of its U.S. theme parks and resorts over the next
decade.
   The entertainment concern filed yesterday for the proposed
offering of $1.5 billion of zero-coupon bonds due 2005. The
bonds are convertible into cash equal to the market price of
Euro Disneyland S.C.A., a publicly held French company
established to build and operate Euro Disneyland.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's a unique twist," said William Gross, managing
director at Pacific Investment Management Co., a Newport
Beach, Calif., fixed-income manager.
   Disney is the largest company to raise cash by selling
convertible zeros. The offering is the largest convertible
bond issue ever and the first time that a zero-coupon bond
purchased by U.S. investors is convertible into the cash
equivalent of the price of a foreign stock, said Lee Cole,
managing director at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, the
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. unit that is sole underwriter of the
issue.
   "There isn't anything else like this," said Michael Carr,
a Manasquan, N.J., money manager who specializes in
convertible bonds. "It's an intriguing investment."
Obviously, investors won't buy it for the 6% return but for
the possible appreciation of the Euro Disneyland stock, Mr.
Carr said.
   Other companies, such as Motorola Inc., MCI Communications
Corp. and Turner Broadcasting System Inc., have sold
convertible zeros, but those bonds were converted into the
U.S. shares of these concerns.
   The investment will be a complicated one for U.S.
investors to analyze since its return will depend not only on
U.S interest rates and how well Euro Disneyland does, but
also on the relationship of the French franc to the dollar at
time of conversion. Investors won't actually get stock in
Euro Disneyland but U.S. dollars equivalent to the price of
Euro Disneyland stock in francs. "The calculations will make
the computer jockeys delirious with joy," says Mr. Carr.
   The zero-coupon bonds, which are called Liquid Yield
Option Notes, will pay a yield of 6% to maturity. They will
be priced at a deep discount of about $412 per $1,000 bond,
and they will be convertible at any time at a premium of 15%
to the price of Euro Disneyland stock on the day the bonds
are issued.
   Euro Disneyland is listed on stock exchanges in Paris,
London and Brussels. It closed yesterday at the equivalent of
$18.625 on the Paris exchange. Euro Disneyland, a theme park
and resort complex near Paris, is scheduled to open in 1992.
It is 49% owned by Walt Disney Co.
   Merrill Lynch has been the dominant underwriter for these
zero-coupon convertible securities since they were introduced
five years ago.
   Richard Nanula, Disney's treasurer, said the proposed June
offering is expected to bring in about $600 million that will
be used for capital spending and to repay more expensive
commercial paper outstanding. "Normally, it would cost us
much more to issue debt, but since we are sharing a portion
of the Euro Disneyland stock appreciation with investors,
we're able to issue the debt at an attractive rate for us,"
he said.
   Mr. Nanula said Disney doesn't plan to hedge its franc
holdings in case Euro Disneyland's stock soars and the franc
weakens, providing a big payout for investors who opt to
convert the bonds. The reason: "We own 83 million shares of
Euro Disneyland ourselves," he said.
   Zeros have an added attraction over traditional
convertibles in that the issuer doesn't make periodic
interest payments to bondholders yet is allowed to deduct the
implied interest from taxes. But bondholders do have to pay
taxes on the implied interest they receive -- one of the
drawbacks in investing in zero-coupon bonds.
   In January, Walt Disney announced a multibillion-dollar
expansion of its theme parks and resorts in Florida and
California over the next decade, including new
separate-admission parks in both states.

   Japanese Turn to U.S. for Cable Shows

   TOKYO -- Japan may dominate in supplying televisions to
the world's living rooms. But when it comes to cable TV,
Japan's couch potatoes still have to buy American.
   Suppliers of U.S. movies and TV programs are facing a
potential bonanza as Japan, one of the world's largest
television markets, rushes into cable television and other
programming possibilities. More than 20 Japanese cable
operators are starting this year, and there are plans for a
total of at least 60. In addition, more than 30 regular
broadcast networks are getting off the ground, with many more
on the drawing board. Direct-satellite broadcasting is also
taking off.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the U.S., where there are plenty of programs to
fill the vast array of cable channels, the new Japanese
broadcasters simply don't have enough shows. With little time
or money to produce new programs, channels are often forced
to air the same old movies, and even cut down on hours of
transmission.
   "Companies will inevitably turn to the U.S." for
programming, considering the current show shortage and the
burgeoning number of channels, says Iwao Ishida, president of
the Cable Television Program Suppliers Association, a
Japanese trade group.
   In fact, big U.S. names such as Turner Broadcasting Co.'s
Cable News Network and United International Pictures, which
is the overseas distributor of movies made by MGM/UA
Entertainment Co. and Paramount Pictures Corp., have already
established a presence in Japan. ESPN Inc., the largest cable
network in the U.S., started broadcasting last month. And
Reiss Media Enterprises Inc., which operates a pay-TV channel
in the U.S., plans to air films over a direct-broadcast
channel, via satellite, that will start up later this year.
   Among American suppliers of programming, "there's a good
deal of interest" in the Japanese market, says Andrew
Brilliant, senior vice president of ESPN International. "I
know others are looking."
   The Japanese government has great hopes for cable
television. As one of cable's chief promoters, Tokyo hopes
cable TV will mushroom in 10 years into a 1.7 trillion yen
($11.15 billion) market.
   Japan's cable television, which was launched as far back
as 1954 to help transmit regular TV programs to people living
in the mountains, is still a fledgling industry. Only 1% of
Japan's 37 million households now subscribe to any cable
network, compared with nearly 60% of the U.S. population,
according to statistics compiled by Dentsu Inc., Japan's
biggest advertising agency.
   For the time being, that makes subscription costs
extremely high. One Tokyo network charges a hook-up fee
equivalent to around $800, along with a charge of 3,700 yen
($24) a month. With a choice of seven television channels in
most urban areas and thriving video rental shops in every
neighborhood, few analysts think pay television will spread
as quickly as in the U.S.
   Some U.S. cable giants such as Time Warner Inc.'s HBO unit
and Viacom Inc.'s MTV think the market is still too small to
venture into. "It's quite a thorny road," says Yasuhiro Kuno,
president of Viacom Japan Inc., which is acting as a liaison
office for MTV in Japan.
   Others in the industry are confident that by offering a
wide range of new programs, cable will eventually attract
Japan's dedicated TV viewers, who on average watch the tube
three hours a day. (American households watch an average
seven hours a day.) They believe it won't be hard to compete
with Japan's current TV offerings, which are dominated by
trivia quiz shows, vaudeville comedy routines and dramas
casting not-so-talented pop singers. As the number of
Japanese households nears 43 million by the year 2000, many
analysts project that Japan's cable-TV market will at least
surpass the European market, which is also just getting off
the ground.
   "The key is the availability of attractive software," says
ESPN's Mr. Brilliant. Launching its effort, ESPN, in a 160
million-yen joint venture with the giant trading company C.
Itoh &amp; Co., is running 48 hours of programming a week. The
offerings include golf tournaments and boxing, as well as
such lesser-known activities as rodeo and cheerleading.
Dentsu owns rights to the big sport -- U.S. major league
baseball -- which will be shown on a separate network.
   The global news coverage of CNN, which is broadcast on
Japan's first cable network, operated by Asahi National
Broadcasting Co., apparently is drawing viewers. Originally,
CNN was aired only in hotel rooms, but now it's gaining an
audience among business people and students, despite the
language barrier, says Hiroki Iijima, a company sales
official. The cable network aims to triple subscribers to one
million in three years, boosting revenue to as much as 30
billion yen.
   Hollywood studios are hoping that Japanese movie fanatics
will become loyal cable viewers. UIP, the overseas movie
distributor, last year opened a pay-per-view, all-movie
channel, called Star Channel, in a joint venture with
Tohokushinsha Film Co., Japan's biggest distributor of
foreign movies. The daily 22-hour programming is taking off
by offering collections of Audrey Hepburn movies and U.S.
classics that never came to Japan, as well as recent
releases, says Katsumi Takahashi, general manager of
Tohokushinsha's cable business. Mr. Takahashi won't release
subscription figures, but says that despite the monthly fee
of 2,500 yen, the movie station has become the fourth most
popular among all television channels that cable TV
subscribers watch.
   That's pushing Warner Brothers, Orion Pictures Corp. and
Columbia Pictures Entertainment, to offer Star Channel their
supply of films as well. "There will be more Hollywood
movies," says Mr. Takahashi, "They're all wanting to join."
(Both analysts and Tohokushinsha say that Sony Corp.'s
purchase of Columbia won't have any effect on the studio's
position in the Japanese cable industry. Even without Sony,
Columbia already had established ties with Tohokushinsha in
video software.)
   Analysts say that aggressive marketing in direct
broadcasting, which started in Japan two years ago, is good
for cable, in the sense that it is already promoting the
concept of paying to watch television. What's more, the local
cable operators are including direct satellite broadcasting
as part of the package for subscribing to cable television,
as an incentive for consumers. NHK, Japan's public television
network, expects that by the end of the year its two
direct-broadcast satellite stations and another commercial
satellite network slated to begin operations in 1990 will
attract two million subscribers.
   "In America, things happened step by step," says Taijin
Shiota, a cable television department manager at Dentsu. "But
Japan learned from watching the U.S. and started everything
at once."

   Proxy-Expert Carter Faces Suit by VPI

   VPI Group PLC, which acquired Donald Carter's proxy
solicitation firm in 1987, sued Mr. Carter in federal court
in Manhattan, N.Y., accusing the former proxy king of
racketeering, fraud and breach of contract.
   The British company, formerly known as Valin Pollen
International, claimed Mr. Carter's alleged misconduct
inflated the price VPI paid when it acquired Carter
Organization. The suit charges that because of the alleged
improprieties, Carter Organization's credibility and business
prospects were hurt. The suit seeks unspecified damages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Carter, credited with transforming the stock-proxy
business into a tool of corporate raiders, pleaded guilty in
March to charges of grand larceny and personal income-tax
evasion. Prosecutors said the charges stemmed from a scheme
in which clients of Mr. Carter's firm were overcharged and
billed for false expenses -- the same allegations made in
VPI's suit.
   Mr. Carter, who continued as Carter Organization chairman
and chief executive officer when it was acquired by VPI, was
fired after he entered his guilty plea in state court in
Manhattan.
   Carter Organization specializes in collecting shareholder
votes or proxies for stockholder meetings, as well as
identifying large stockholders that can be solicited in
takeover battles.
   John Tigue, Mr. Carter's attorney, said he hadn't seen the
suit and couldn't comment.
   In the suit, VPI said that prior to July 29, 1987, the
closing date of its purchase of Carter Organization, Mr.
Carter repeatedly directed his company to overbill clients
for expenses. The suit alleged that Mr. Carter then created
false documentation to cover up the overcharges.
   VPI also alleged that Mr. Carter charged large amounts of
personal expenses to Carter Organization, disguising them as
business expenses. The suit said the personal expenses caused
Carter Organization's tax liability to be understated and
resulted in the firm's filing false tax returns.
   It also accused Mr. Carter of making false statements in
the sale of his company. VPI paid about $76 million in cash
and stock to acquire the company, and it was to make
additional payments based on Carter Organization's earnings.
By not disclosing the overcharges, VPI says, Mr. Carter
understated the company's liabilities and overstated its
income.
   In a statement released in London, VPI Chairman Angus
Maitland said: "We have been more than willing to reach an
out of court settlement with Mr. Carter, but in that effort
we have been frustrated at every turn."

   COPYRIGHTED WRITINGS can be used in critical biography,
court rules.
   A federal appeals court in New York reversed a lower court
ruling that appeared to signify tighter restrictions on the
use of copyrighted materials by authors and journalists.
   The appeals court ruled that Carol Publishing Group's
critical biography of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church
of Scientology, doesn't violate federal law by including
copyrighted quotations from Mr. Hubbard's published writings.
   The plaintiff was New Era Publications International, a
Copenhagen publisher of Scientology books which holds the
license on all of Mr. Hubbard's works. Mr. Hubbard died in
1986.
   Coming after a series of decisions in New York federal
courts that placed copyright concerns ahead of free-press
interests, the opinion seems to reflect a broader
interpretation of what constitutes fair use of copyrighted
materials. The decision "reaffirms the vitality of the
fair-use doctrine where material is being used for
journalistic scholarly purposes," said Melvin Wulf, a laywer
with the New York law firm Beldock Levine &amp; Hoffman, which
represented Carol Publishing.
   The court's opinion relies in part on the fact that Mr.
Hubbard's works had already been published. The U.S. Supreme
Court has granted copyright protection to unpublished works.
And in a much publicized 1986 case, the New York appeals
court created a strong presumption against the use of
unpublished works when it forbade a biographer of J.D.
Salinger to quote from unpublished letters.
   New Era Publications hasn't decided whether to appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court, says its lawyer, Michael Hertzberg of
Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky &amp; Lieberman in New
York.

   DU PONT WINS ROUND in unusual dispute over rights to corn
seeds.
   Du Pont Co. and two co-plaintiffs won an early round in a
complicated legal battle over who owns the rights to seeds
developed by the University of Illinois.
   Du Pont and Pfister Hybrid Corn Co. signed an exclusive
licensing agreement with the university to develop seeds used
for the production of corn that is high in oil. They sued
Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., after the company
obtained some seeds from a professor.
   In recent years more companies have defended their legal
claims to specific plant varieties. But this case is one of
the first to address the issue of what rights seed breeders
retain to novel varieties when they don't have a patent or a
certificate issued by the Department of Agriculture,
according to William T. Cahill of Chicago-based Phelan Pope &amp;
John, which represents the plaintiffs.
   In 1989 Du Pont of Wilmington and Pfister, of El Paso,
Ill., signed the agreement with the university. The companies
agreed to pay the school royalties in exchange for the right
to use the seeds it developed commercially. The companies
have spent about $4 million on the project.
   The seeds had been developed over a 30-year period by a
professor, Denton Alexander. Using sophisticated genetic
selection and breeding techniques, he developed a corn with
an oil content at least two times greater than the amount in
ordinary corn. Livestock and poultry fed the corn grow faster
and produce more meat.
   Six months after the agreement was signed, the university
learned Mr. Alexander had given five special lines of the
corn seed covered under the licensing agreement to Pioneer.
   Mr. Alexander said he had been seriously ill at the time
and regretted his mistake. Pioneer refused to return the
seeds, which the company says is property in the public
domain that it obtained properly. In their suit, the
university, Du Pont and Pfister alleged that Pioneer
misappropriated the seeds in violation of the Illinois Trade
Secrets Act, among other claims.
   In a ruling made public this week, federal Judge Harold A.
Baker of Danville prohibited Pioneer from using any of the
disputed seeds pending the outcome of the trial, scheduled
for November.
   Jerold Jacover of Chicago-based Willian Brinks Olds Hofer
Gilson &amp; Lione, which represents Pioneer, said the company
will appeal.
   The Pioneer lawyer said he is concerned that the company
might have to dig up the seeds it had planted.

   ACLU PRESIDENT will step down.
   American Civil Liberties Union President Norman Dorsen
said he won't seek another term as president of the
70-year-old public-interest legal organization.
   Mr. Dorsen is a constitutional scholar and a professor at
New York University Law School. In his 14 years as president
of the ACLU, he headed its efforts to oppose the confirmation
of Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork and successfully argued
U.S. Supreme Court cases that established constitutional
rights of illegitimate children and the right of juveniles to
fair hearings in delinquency proceedings.
   His successor will be chosen this fall.

   To Post Lower Net
   For Second Period

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Adobe Systems Inc. said it
expects to report lower-than-anticipated fiscal
second-quarter earnings, reflecting significantly lower
revenue from its biggest customer, Apple Computer Inc.
   For the quarter ending June 1, the software company said
it expects to report earnings ranging from 27 cents to 35
cents a share, on revenue of $32 million to $35 million. It
added that it expected results for the remaining two quarters
of the year to improve from second-quarter level, but that it
expected fiscal 1990 results to be below analysts' current
expectations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the 1989 fiscal-second quarter, Adobe had net income of
$7.6 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $28.1
million.
   "It is startling," said Bruce Lupatkin, a software analyst
at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco. Adobe stock will "take
a major beating tomorrow," he added. The company estimates
were dislosed after markets closed yesterday. Adobe, finished
at $50.50 a share, up $1.50, in national over-the-counter
trading.
   Mr. Lupatkin said he had expected second-quarter per-share
earnings of 51 cents and revenue of $42 million.
   Adobe cited lower-than-expected revenue from Apple,
reflecting a 23% drop in shipment of Apple products
incorporating Adobe technology compared with the first
quarter.
   The company also said two other "significant customers" --
NEC Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. -- were
experiencing reduced shipments because of new product
development and delays.
   Adobe develops and sells programs that create images and
type fonts on desktop computer screens and printers. Last
fall, Apple, along with software giant Microsoft Corp., said
they would offer a product that would rival Adobe's
technology, but Apple has continued to be Adobe's most
important client. In March, IBM gave Adobe a boost when it
said it would provide Adobe's printer software with its OS/2
operating system for IBM PCs.
   "Adobe appears to be caught in a jetwash of a transition
here," said Mr. Lupatkin, noting that companies such as IBM
are "ramping up volumes, while Apple is fading into the
sunset. It is a transitional issue."

   Democracy in Armenia

   Mikhail Gorbachev continues to struggle with the question
of political legitimacy. He has announced plans to expose the
government's new economic program to a referendum, though
it's hard for us to see precisely what might be learned from
the exercise. He would be asking voters to pick between the
doleful status quo and what he's offering -- a watered-down
reform called the "regulated market economy." Will a vote
against the reform mean people want a more radical program or
less change?
   Democracy is normally about real choices, and while the
Kremlin continues to toy with the idea, it's well along
elsewhere in the Soviet empire. Elections Sunday in Soviet
Armenia for its Supreme Soviet provided important gains for
the Pan-National Party, an anti-communist grouping on the
ballot for the first time. Turnout was low -- about 50% --
and results were so unclear that the republic faces a runoff.
But the anti-communists won the Armenian capital of Yerevan
and the city of Kirovakan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Voters in Parakar, just outside Yerevan, sent a
particularly forceful message. They gave 91% of their vote to
Paruyr Hayrikyan, who backs secession from Moscow. Mr.
Hayrikyan rolled to this margin of victory without shaking a
single voter's hand. The Soviet government dumped him in
Ethiopia back in 1988, and he conducted this campaign from
exile in Glendale, California.
   That Soviet Armenia could produce such a result shows the
continuing attraction of the democratic impulse. It must be
remembered that Armenia today is a state in considerable
distress. It has recently endured the devastating 1988
earthquake, a lengthy railroad blockade by Azerbaijan and a
January massacre of Armenians in Baku. Not surprisingly,
these events have sent much of the republic into new
lawlessness and despair. The neighboring republic of Georgia,
which will have elections this fall, has similar instability,
with anti-communist forces forming to produce democracy or
simply to destabilize the republic.
   It would be wrong, though, to write off the Caucasus as
little more than a budding Lebanon, as is often the tendency
in the West when dealing with this part of the world. To
dismiss the region as a caldron of inter-ethnic animosity is
to give the Kremlin a rationale for suppressing any
disturbances in the region, as it did last January in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   We're not advocating bloodshed in the Soviet Union, but it
is important to recognize that there are now people
struggling to gain the advantages of democratic
self-determination in places such as Armenia. If the
democratic impulse is to take hold in an Armenia, Georgia or
Lithuania, it is going to be necessary for the West to notice
their advances and support their legitimate needs.
   Moscow took Mr. Hayrikyan's citizenship when it jettisoned
him from the country, barring his return to what is now his
own constituency. If Mr. Gorbachev wants to offer voters
choices about their politics or their economy, he could start
telling the exiled but newly elected Mr. Hayrikyan that he
can have his passport back.

   Brokerage Firms Spend Lavishly
   To Beef Up High-Tech Trading

   NEW YORK -- While brokerage firms slice away manpower
these days, they are also engaged in one of Wall Street's
biggest spending booms on high-technology trading.
   But for all the boasting, Wall Street's spree is really a
game of catch-up. As takeovers and other sources of revenue
have dried up, brokerage firms are looking more to trading
operations for profits. Suddenly, even the biggest investment
banks find themselves lagging profoundly behind some of their
biggest customers when it comes to using computers for
trading and research.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "When Wall Street put brokerage firms together, all they
needed were people, telephones, quote machines and contacts,"
said Mony Rueven, senior vice president at Jefferies &amp; Co.,
which is spending heavily on computerized trading. But big
institutional investors already are ahead and "getting more
sophisticated and quantitative" all the time, he warned.
   When Wall Street worries, it spends big. At Salomon
Brothers Inc., more than 500 powerful Sun Microsystems Inc.
workstations have replaced the timid personal computers that
traders once used as upgraded calculators. Peter Bloom,
Salomon's senior operating officer, calls the $15,000
workstations "high-powered engines" that can do dozens of
tasks simultaneously. People familiar with Salomon say the
firm is using the machines for surveillance of hundreds of
bond and stock prices around the world, watching for price
discrepancies that traders can leap on.
   Nearby, a special team works behind locked doors. Called
"Fulcrum," because Salomon wants to "leverage technology,"
the group is building the high-tech guts for Salomon's new
headquarters at 7 World Trade Center. Mr. Bloom says Salomon
will have one of the most technologically advanced trading
rooms in the world when the project is finished.
   Up the street from Salomon, at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.'s bond trading room, Shearson's huge bond inventory is
constantly updated by trading assistants who enter orders
speaking directly to a computer that understands the human
voice. The system helps Shearson get a better grip on its
trading risk and tracks which institutions are buying and
selling bonds throughout the day.
   Despite the costly buildup, Wall Street technologists
concede securities firms still have a long way to go before
they catch up with many of their big institutional customers.
Mr. Bloom of Salomon Brothers said Wall Street is "resting on
the foundation of technology built in the 1970s."
   Even Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., which many view as the Wall
Street firm most up-to-date technologically, finds itself
lagging behind. In a confidential report entitled "The
Challenge of the Electronic Marketplace" that is circulating
among top managers, Morgan Stanley's own technology task
force warns: "With the increased sophistication of
institutional investors, it has become mandatory for {Morgan
Stanley} to create vehicles that will enable us to maintain
our presence in this fast-changing marketplace. The firm must
position itself for a new market order."
   But Wall Street isn't ready for these changes. The same
report finds that among Morgan Stanley's employees, "few saw
technology as a tool which could be used to overcome hurdles
and build business profitability." The report continues,
"Most business unit managers were unfamiliar with the details
of the electronic marketplace innovations in their areas." It
added, "There seemed little thought given to the fact that
the abundance and speed of market data available today means
that a trader can no longer do all the processing mentally."
   Such "parochialism," as Morgan Stanley calls it, seems
rife at other Wall Street firms. For years, Wall Street's
technologists have been consigned to the important, though
less spectacular, task of automating the back office that
processes trades. Typically, the old guard of traders view
technology as a cost that doesn't add much to their daily
profits.
   But sophisticated money managers, handling billions of
dollars from pension funds and other institutions, have long
embraced computerized trading and research. At Wells Fargo
Nikko Investment Advisors, for example, $80 billion is
managed without a single glance at a Wall Street research
report.
   Most of that money is run with the help of computer models
in huge index funds, which mimic market benchmarks such as
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index. And more than half of
the Wells Fargo portfolio is traded inside the firm, without
an exchange or brokerage firm.
   Not only big investors, but a host of specialty traders
such as Instinet Corp., an electronic trading network, and
broker Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities have taken
huge leaps ahead of mainline Wall Street firms in electronic
trading.
   Mr. Madoff's group of traders, for example, use computer
programs that constantly present them with the best
opportunity to hedge or swap a securities position, something
not widely available on a typical Wall Street stock-trading
desk. Electronic stock trading by big institutional investors
on Instinet, a unit of Reuters Holdings PLC, is up 40.2% in
the first quarter of this year from the year-earlier period.
Instinet's market share in over-the-counter and
exchange-listed stocks hit 4.24% last quarter, up from 3% a
year earlier.
   "We are dealing with clients that are just as
sophisticated as we are in the use of computers in investment
strategy," says Michael Sanderson, president of Instinet. "If
you are not in the front end of the curve, you will be left
behind."
   More and more Wall Street firms are getting the message.
At PaineWebber Inc., analysts are developing a system for the
program-trading department that will study the amount of
stock offered to buy or sell on market makers' "books" for
hundreds of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
PaineWebber hopes to be able to develop a computer that will
sell baskets of stock in times of abundant buyers and buy
stock when there are lots of sellers.
   According to a Cray Computer Corp. employee, First Boston
Corp., Shearson and Bankers Trust Co. are renting time on
Cray supercomputers, the fastest number-crunching machines in
the world. These firms are using Crays to get rapid answers
about the impact of proposed shifts in their customers' big
securities portfolios. In an hour, a Cray can do calculations
that would take a PC a year to do.
   Also, there are signs that a new guard of
computer-versatile traders and managers is rising in the
ranks of Wall Street, gaining power and prestige.
   In November 1987, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. hired George F.
Adam Jr., once an Air Force officer who helped launch several
Apollo space missions, making him a Goldman partner and
senior technologist at the firm. It was one of the few times
that Goldman has hired an outsider as a partner. A trade
magazine, Computerworld, estimates Mr. Adam earns between
$700,000 and $800,000 a year. Mr. Adam declined to give his
salary.
   A year ago, Salomon hired Francis A. Dramis, a veteran of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., to lead Salomon's thrust
into technology. Mr. Dramis was hired as a managing director,
the equivalent of partner, something that rarely happens at
Salomon.
   The new breed of technologists have caught the eye of Wall
Street senior management because these high-tech experts are
adding money to the bottom line by cutting costs, a route
that trading and research personnel rarely take.
   When it comes to profitability, "sales and trading was 90%
of the business years ago," said Stephen P. Gott, executive
vice president of trading services at Shearson, a unit of
American Express Co. Now, computer systems help account for
50% of profits, he said, adding that there's "an absolute
need for them due to high trading volumes."
   Said Nunzio Tartaglia, a former Morgan Stanley computer
trading expert, "We are at a watershed point because the
machines are making big jumps in speed." Mr. Tartaglia left
Morgan Stanely last September and is now working with Richard
Bartels, a founding partner of money manager Rosenberg
Institutional Equity Management, in a high-tech hedge fund.
   "Maybe it's insular thinking, maybe it's arrogance," said
Raymond Killian, senior managing director at Jefferies, about
Wall Street's lag in technology. "But any firm watching
what's going on has to make a commitment to technology."

   CRAY RESEARCH Inc. supercomputer-time is being rented by
First Boston Corp., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Bankers
Trust Co., according to a Cray employee. In a report on
high-technology trading on Wall Street in Friday's edition,
the computer maker was misidentified.

   Senate Rejects Death Penalty Defense
   Built Around Racial Discrimination

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate rejected a provision that would
have enabled defendants to fight the death penalty by
presenting evidence that executions are imposed in a racially
discriminatory manner in the jurisdiction where they are
being sentenced.
   The defeat of the measure on a 58-38 vote removed a major
obstacle to passage of the omnibus anti-crime bill, which
includes provisions that would extend the death penalty to
six additional federal crimes and would bring 23 long-dormant
death statutes into conformity with Supreme Court procedural
requirements.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials have said the president
would veto legislation allowing a legal defense based on
evidence of racially disproportionate imposition of capital
punishment.
   The bill's future still remains uncertain because it
contains other provisions vehemently opposed by conservative
senators and the president -- in particular, a three-year ban
on nine types of semi-automatic "assault weapons."
   Mr. Bush urged lawmakers to approve "a good, strong
anti-crime bill" without the assault-weapon ban. The Senate
didn't complete action on the crime bill yesterday but set it
aside until early next month, when lawmakers return from
their Memorial Day recess. The House is far behind in
considering comparable legislation.
   The Senate bill also includes a provision that would
reverse a 1989 Supreme Court decision and prohibit executions
of mentally retarded defendants in federal cases. By a 59-38
vote, senators rejected a Republican amendment that would
have allowed execution of mentally retarded persons if they
are shown "to understand the difference between right and
wrong." In addition, negotiators from both parties
compromised and said no one under the age of 17 could be
executed for a federal crime.
   The Senate also reversed a decision it made Wednesday and
adopted more-stringent curbs on appeals by death-row inmates.
Senators voted 52-46 to reconsider a previously approved
Democratic version of the death-row appeals measure, and then
they approved a Republican alternative on a voice vote.
   Both versions were designed to limit so-called habeas
corpus petitions, by which death row residents may challenge
the constitutionality of their convictions or sentences --
typically in multiple, piecemeal federal appeals. Among other
differences, the Republican version would establish a 60-day
time limit for filing the federal petitions, while Democrats
proposed a one-year time limit.
   To the surprise of Bush administration lobbyists, the
Republican version was altered in private negotiations to
include language that would allow death-row inmates to file
appeals based on certain new constitutional rights announced
by the Supreme Court after their convictions. President Bush
strongly opposes such language, which appears to overturn
Supreme Court precedent restricting such appeals, and Chief
Justice William Rehnquist also has made vehement attacks on
it.
   Proponents of the racial-disparity defense to execution,
which was sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.)
reacted angrily in defeat, citing numerous studies purporting
to show racism in application of capital punishment.
   "In this country, if you're white and you kill a black
person, it's almost certain that prosecutors won't seek the
death penalty," said Richard Burr, a lawyer with the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund. "But if you're black, and you commit
precisely the same crime against a white person, you're far
more likely to be condemned to die." Conservatives had warned
that the Kennedy provision would eliminate capital punishment
on both the state and federal levels because it would place a
huge burden on prosecutors to disprove race was a factor in
death sentences.

   It's hard to feel glad about President Bush's announcement
yesterday that he wants to renew China's most-favored-nation
trading status. It was the correct call in a rough game.
Trade has indeed proved an opening wedge for free ideas in
China. Revoking MFN and making Americans pay more for
Shanghai knitwear probably wouldn't help budge the Communist
Party from its perch.
   But there's something that sticks in the craw about
conferring the encomium, "most favored," on anything
involving the Chinese government. Surely there must be a way
to renew what is actually routine trading status, accorded to
all but a handful of nations, without implying a political
pat on the back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's statement that China has made some
responsive moves toward U.S. concern for human rights is
wishful thinking. The lifting of martial law in Tibet and
restoration of U.S. consular access there doesn't stop the
torture we keep hearing about. It guarantees no freedoms. No
one in China is safe from the whims of a party that has shot,
jailed and gagged its critics without even a gesture of
remorse.
   Dissident Fang Lizhi remains a prisoner in the American
Embassy. His terrible crime was that he spoke out in favor of
democracy, and the Chinese people liked what he said. The
same government that released 211 dissidents from prison
earlier this month retains the power to arbitrarily jail them
tomorrow. Human rights will improve in China the day the
party steps aside to allow civilized and politically
legitimate institutions of government to develop.
   Congress will now be poking around in this sad swamp as it
debates whether to block Mr. Bush's MFN recommendation -- a
move that would require a two-thirds disapproval vote in both
chambers. It's worth noting, however, that righteous anger at
George Bush and China can also serve as camouflage for the
protectionist jingoes in Congress who would just as soon wall
out Chinese textiles and toys regardless of what goes on in
Beijing.
   There are actions Congress could take that might help wipe
the grin off Deng Xiaoping's face without hurting the Chinese
people. For openers, it might be appropriate to recommend
that most favored nation be renewed for China under a
different label. Say, "capitalist trading status." Why not?
We suspect the dissidents now silenced in China would get a
satisfying chuckle out of it. And it would be a lot harder
for the Chinese government to tell the world that the United
States is coming around to Beijing's point of view.
   More seriously, Congress might harness the MFN debate to
another matter that is acutely important to both Communist
China and the rival Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan.
And it's an issue that underscores U.S. respect for
governments that have made genuine progress. The issue is
admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT.
   Neither Beijing nor Taipei currently belongs to GATT, and
both would very much like to join. Technically, there is no
problem with both Taipei and Beijing signing on as separate
members. Under GATT regulations, they need only have separate
customs areas, as does Hong Kong. The decision is up to the
member nations of GATT, but a public recommendation from
either President Bush or Congress could swing a lot of
weight.
   Communist China has been kept out essentially because the
member nations think its repressive, centrally planned
economy is just too big a mess to tangle with. GATT has been
waiting for Beijing to reform enough so that it might be
ready to participate in decent society.
   Taiwan lost its observer status in 1971, when GATT took
its lead from the United Nations' decision to replace Taiwan
with the People's Republic of China. Since then, Taiwan has
made enormous progress in its economic and political
development. Taipei's Chinese government has liberalized its
markets and flung open the political debate. Taiwan is now
one of the most productive and promising spots in the
developing world. But, as a GATT spokesman told us last fall,
GATT has held up Taiwan's admission as a full member. It's
waiting until Communist China has matured enough to join.
GATT doesn't want to get China miffed by letting Taiwan
through the door first.
   By urging that GATT get on with Taiwan's admission, now,
instead of waiting years for China, the U.S. would send a
useful signal. It would set straight for China's leaders
where they rank in world esteem, compared with their
capitalist, democratizing rivals on Taiwan (who graciously
recommended extension of MFN for China). It would give Taiwan
its due. And in a time when the U.S. is already granting the
communist governments of China and the Soviet Union
extraordinary political favors, it would remind the world
that what America most favors are governments that understand
the link between capitalist trade and freedom.

   Report by SEC
   Lashes Chicago
   Futures Marts

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
launched a frontal attack on the Chicago futures markets,
blaming much of the Oct. 13 mini-crash on program selling
triggered on those exchanges.
   The SEC, which made its assault in the report of its study
of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average last October, is certain to use the report as
ammunition in its newly escalated battle with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. The SEC, along with the Treasury
Department, is proposing to switch regulatory oversight of
stock-index futures from the CFTC.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stock-index futures, which are traded on the commodity
exchanges, allow investors to bet on the direction of a
basket of stocks without ever owning the securities.
   The Oct. 13 plunge, during which the securities markets
had paper losses of $190 billion, was stunningly fast. In the
roughly 90 minutes after UAL Corp. announced that its
leveraged buy-out had collapsed, the Dow fell almost nonstop
until it closed at 6.9% down from the day's opening level.
Volume levels were massive, with 112 million shares changing
hands in the final hour, alone.
   That decline, coming on a Friday, touched off widespread
concern that the following Monday would result in another
1987-style crash. But share prices rebounded on Oct. 16 after
a sharp early morning drop, and the market stabilized.
   The SEC study, which in some aspects directly disputes a
report issued by the CFTC earlier this week, shows that last
October's slide was in many ways similar to the 1987 crash.
In particular, the SEC report contends that computer-aided
program trading -- in this case index arbitrage, the most
common form of program trading -- accounted for an unusually
high percentage of share volume during the 190-point decline.
   Index arbitrage is a technique that seeks to profit from
price differences between index futures and the basket of
stocks represented in the futures.
   But the report also shows some significant differences
between the 1989 minicrash and the 1987 plunge. Selling on
the futures markets centered on "small and large speculative
accounts, foreign accounts, options market makers and major
broker-dealers," the SEC said. Institutional investors, such
as banks, mutual funds and pension funds, which were the
major culprits of the 1987 crash, were net buyers in last
year's slide.
   Moreover, the SEC contended that Chicago Mercantile
Exchange floor traders, or locals, were net sellers during
most of the 1989 collapse. Indeed, "locals were the most
active aggregate sellers from 2:40 to 4:15," the SEC said,
representing almost 25% of the selling in Standard &amp; Poor's
500stock index futures during the period. "We did not find
that the futures floor provided any net liquidity," said
Richard Ketchum, the SEC's head of market regulation, who
headed up the study.
   That part of the report contrasts sharply with the study
issued just days ago by the CFTC. While the commodities
regulators' work also shows that institutions were buyers, it
doesn't single out futures pit locals as culprits. Indeed,
CFTC officials, who used the same data as SEC staffers,
wondered about the SEC's conclusions. "Locals are large
participants on both sides in most time periods," Steven
Manaster, the CFTC's chief economist, said yesterday.
"Sometimes they'll be a little long, and sometimes they'll be
a little short."
   The SEC said that selling by futures traders hit a peak of
50% of the total futures sell volume during one 10-minute
period that was studied. Mr. Ketchum said that by contrast,
specialists on the New York Stock Exchange were "substantial
net buyers" during the periods of peak stress.
   But the biggest problem was index arbitrage, the SEC
report said. "Index arbitrage and other program selling
significantly accelerated and exacerbated the market
decline," the report added. Program selling accounted for 36%
of the total S&amp;P 500 shares traded when futures weren't
subject to price limits, the study said, higher than
aggregate index-arbitrage levels during the 1987 crash.
   That view also is disputed by the CFTC study, which
concluded that "there was not an extraordinary amount of
index arbitrage activity . . . either in absolute terms or in
relation to total NYSE volume."
   The SEC also said that the "circuit breaker" triggered by
the Oct. 13 decline appears to have slowed the decline. The
restriction, one of several put in place after the 1987 crash
to slow sharp market moves, was set off when the Chicago
Merc's S&amp;P 500 futures contract had fallen 12 points.
Contract prices weren't allowed to decline further for a
half-hour.
   Switching on the circuit breaker "coincided with a sharp
drop-off in the level of program selling on the NYSE and a
reduction in the rate of price decline in NYSE stocks," the
SEC said. After the price limit expired, the SEC report
added, the price decline in Big Board shares accelerated.
   In fact, the Merc's circuit breaker worked so well,
Richard Breeden, SEC chairman, said that perhaps the exchange
should consider keeping it in place until the end of a
trading session, rather than for just 30 minutes. The futures
markets aren't likely to be thrilled by Mr. Breeden's
suggestion that they shut down the pits in periods of stress.
   The SEC surely will use the new report to press its case
on Capitol Hill for more regulatory clout. The report's
findings "underline the interrelationship between these
markets," Mr. Breeden said. "It demonstrates the validity of
the administration's point of view that because we have a
single market" of stocks and index futures, a single
regulator should oversee both.
   Separately, Mr. Breeden offered the first details of how
the SEC would change the stock-index futures market if it
wins congressional approval for a change in regulatory
jurisdiction.
   Mr. Breeden suggested that index-futures investors should
be subject to securities-style protections concerning insider
trading, anti-fraud provisions and suitability standards that
force brokers to make certain that the products are right for
the customer.
   Futures-industry officials have argued in the past that
the products are used almost exclusively by large
institutional investors, who don't need the same level of
protection that many stock-market investors require.

   Budget Negotiators Disagree on Target
   For Deficit Cuts Over Next Five Years

   WASHINGTON -- The budget summit ran into rougher waters as
congressional and administration negotiators disagreed on how
ambitious a goal to set for reducing the deficit over the
next five years.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.)
said Democrats want to aim for a package of spending cuts and
tax increases that would total $550 billion to $600 billion
in the fiscal years 1991 through 1995.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But White House and Republican congressional negotiators
resisted, questioning the wisdom of rushing to set a
five-year goal without any discussion of the policies such a
goal would entail, participants said. Some Republicans lean
toward a five-year goal closer to the $420 billion, five-year
figure set in President Bush's budget.
   The dispute illustrates the political obstacles the summit
faces. Democrats say they want to wipe out the deficit over
five years without relying on the Social Security surplus, a
target that would require deep spending cuts and large tax
increases. They fear the White House simply wants a pact to
get past the 1992 election.
   Republicans are concentrating on achieving a solid
first-year deficit-reduction package of $50 billion or so,
and are in less of a hurry to pin down a five-year target.
They fear the Democrats are trying to lock them into a big
tax increase or are maneuvering to avoid blame should the
talks break down.
   "People had different views on what should be done," said
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.).
   Others stressed that the talks remain in what White House
Budget Director Richard Darman has called "the seminar
stage." Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.), said flatly: "We are not
in negotiation."
   An administration official, who asked not to be named,
said, "We all agree: `Let's get something responsible.' We
still haven't decided what `responsible' is."
   Participants said the two sides are talking about aiming
for a first-year package of spending cuts and tax increases
of between $45 billion and $60 billion, a significant sum,
but one that would still require altering the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   Negotiators set two full days of meetings for June 6 and
7, after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess, to
examine federal spending and revenues in greater detail.
Negotiators haven't agreed how to proceed after that, but
negotiators on both sides say they hope to begin hard
bargaining promptly.
   "The political parties agree that it's far better to see
if we can try to accelerate this," House Budget Chairman Leon
Panetta (D., Calif.) said. Uncertainty over the summit is
already complicating congressional campaigns because
candidates are taking positions on taxes and spending.
   Before yesterday's meeting, President Bush charged that
inaction by Congress has created the current impasse over the
budget deficit, and again refused to offer any detailed
solution of his own.
   In a news conference, Mr. Bush deflected suggestions that
he make a televised statement to the American people
explaining why the summit is necessary. Lawmakers would be
disappointed if he gave the issue such a high profile now, he
suggested, because he would note "the fact that the Congress
appropriates all the money and raises all the revenues.
That's their obligation." Moreover, he asserted that recent
polls indicate "that people understand that the Congress
bears a greater responsibility for this."
   Democrats were quick to respond. "It's the first time in
this century we've seen a president want to give power to the
Congress," Mr. Gephardt said. "The president is wrong if he
thinks the budget is more our responsibility than his."
   Meanwhile, Mr. Bush continued to hear from Republicans who
want him to avoid agreeing to raise taxes. Outspoken tax foes
Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 Republican in the
House, and Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, joined by House
Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, met at the White
House with Mr. Bush and administration budget negotiators.
   At the session at the Capitol, Budget Director Darman gave
negotiators updated deficit forecasts incorporating the
latest Treasury estimates of the cost of cleaning up the
thrift industry. For fiscal 1991, the budget office sees a
deficit of between $179 billion and $205.8 billion, well
above the $64 billion Gramm-Rudman target. This includes
thrift spending of all sorts of between $41.1 and $67.9
billion. For the current year, the budget office now sees a
deficit of $181 billion to $202.7 billion, including $26
billion to $47.7 billion in thrift costs.
   The forecasts rely on revised economic projections that
are subject to change again before the July 15 forecast
required by the Gramm-Rudman law. The budget office now
estimates inflation-adjusted economic growth of 2.9% between
the fourth quarters of 1990 and 1991, down from its January
forecast of 3.3%. Compared with its earlier forecast, it now
sees slightly higher inflation and significantly higher
interest rates for this year and next. It also is forecasting
substantially lower corporate profits for each of the next
five years.
   The budget office now forecasts rates on three-month
Treasury bills will average 7.7% in 1990 and 6.8% in 1991,
compared with its earlier forecast of 6.7% and 5.4%. It
forecasts rates on 10-year Treasury notes at 8.6% for 1990
and 8% for 1991, compared with 7.7% and 6.8% in its earlier
forecast.

   Japanese Say
   Motorola Passed
   Phone Gear Test

   Motorola Inc. said Japan's largest telephone company chose
its digital voice technology as the standard for that
nation's relatively undeveloped cellular phone market.
   Motorola's selection raises hopes for that company and
others seeking to win bigger pieces of Japan's
multibillion-dollar telecommunications market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts' reports on Motorola's apparent triumph sent the
company's common stock soaring to a 52-week high. It rose
$3.75, closing at $83.75.
   In Tokyo, an official at Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications who is involved with the selection said
the decision wasn't final, but that Motorola's equipment had
proved superior in competitive tests.
   The selection of Motorola technology by Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone Corp. means certain of the equipment in all the
cellular phones Nippon Telegraph sells would use systems with
specifications patented by Motorola -- no matter who the
supplier is. Thus the selection would open a huge new market
for Motorola as a supplier and a licenser of cellular systems
made by other manufacturers. A spokesman at Motorola, of
Schaumburg, Ill., couldn't immediately estimate the expected
size of the Japanese market or the anticipated added sales
for his company. But he said, "It will enhance our ability to
sell equipment in Japan."
   The Japanese ministry official said the digital voice
technology standard was one of three categories that were
being examined to draft an overall standard for Japan's
digital mobile phone system. He said testing hasn't yet been
completed for the other two standards, and didn't know if
Motorola was competing for that business.
   The Japanese official, who asked not to be identified,
said the ministry will reach a final decision on digital
standards by the end of the year.
   NTT's announcement last week that it selected Motorola,
along with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and AB L.M.
Ericsson of Sweden, to develop certain equipment was part of
the same study.
   Motorola last year complained that it was being excluded
from parts of Japan's analog mobile-phone market -- the
technology that is used for the current standard. Japan,
under threat of heavy sanctions from the U.S., opened up that
market to Motorola.
   According to some studies, Japan's mobile-phone market has
penetration only about one-fourth that of the U.S. But
analysts have said that opening up the market to more
competitors, in addition to moving to the more advanced
digital technology, may help cut prices and spread use.
   The Motorola technology specifically selected is its
speech coder, which translates the voice for electronic
transmission. Nippon Telegraph has said it expects to
complete development of a new generation of cellular phone
systems by 1992.
   Traditionally, Nippon Telegraph has rarely publicly
disclosed development projects, instead quietly farming them
out to Japanese companies. But, under U.S. pressure, NTT in
recent years has been trying to demonstrate publicly it is
opening up its procurement process to foreign firms.
   NTT ordered $350 million of U.S. equipment in the Japanese
fiscal year that ended in March, but this amount was
equivalent to only 4% of the company's total procurement of
$8.75 billion.
   Separately, Motorola said it received a $35 million order
for cellular phone infrastructure equipment from Japan Mobile
Communications. Motorola said the order will be for equipment
"over the next year" in the Tokyo area. A spokesman said the
contract calls for unspecified additional orders. Some
analysts estimated the value of the contract could reach
several hundred million dollars during the next several
years, and represent yet another breakthrough for Motorola in
the burgeoning Japanese market.

   The SEC alleged that the individuals manipulated the
company's accounting records to record an extra $8.4 million
of revenue and earnings for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31,
1986, when the company reported revenue of $115.7 million and
net income of $8.7 million.
   The commission also alleged that results for the first two
quarters of fiscal 1987 were inflated by $5 million.
   "The individuals settled to put the matter behind them and
avoid protracted litigation," said Theodore Levine, a
Washington, D.C., attorney for Messrs. Stromberg, Agardy and
Whipple. "These were viewed as technical accounting issues,
and they wanted to resolve the matter. . . ."
   In Palo Alto, Calif., an attorney for Mr. Towle declined
comment.
   In San Francisco, a spokesman for URS Corp. noted that the
company isn't named in the complaint, and that the four
individuals who were are no longer with the company. He said
class-action suits against the company arising out of
charges, including some that concerned the SEC, were settled
last year "and are now behind us."
   He said "the company, over a year ago, voluntarily
restated certain of its financial statements, relating to all
of the matters covered by the SEC complaint." He added, "We
have a new management team, new auditors and very strong
financial controls in place now to ensure that a repetition
does not occur."

   Bill to Strengthen
   SEC Is Approved
   By a Senate Panel

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Banking Committee unanimously
approved a bill that would give the Securities and Exchange
Commission substantially broader fining power and allow the
agency to shut down alleged securities-industry wrongdoers.
   The legislation also will give the SEC easier access to
grand-jury investigations in securities-law cases, a power
the SEC has sought since it found resources strapped by the
insider-trading cases of the mid- to late-1980s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Senate version of the bill was amended prior to
committee approval to set stricter guidelines for the civil
fines, which would greatly expand the agency's enforcement
powers. The House hasn't moved far on its version of the
bill, which remains at the subcommittee level.
   Under the new system, a first tier sets a maximum of
$5,000 for each violation for individuals and $50,000 per
violation for brokerage firms and other entities for a range
of mostly inadvertent securities violations, such as late or
incorrect filings. The next tier sets maximums of $50,000 for
individuals and $250,000 for others if the violation involves
"fraud, deceipt, manipulation" or disregard for law. The
third level sets limits of $100,000 for individuals and
$500,000 for others if the second-tier criterion holds and
the violation "directly or indirectly resulted in substantial
losses."
   Currently, the SEC has the authority to impose fines for
insider-trading violations.
   The legislation approved by the panel allows the SEC to
order a brokerage firm or other entity regulated by the
agency to "cease and desist" from wrongdoing. That rule is
narrower than the earlier proposed legislation, which would
have allowed the SEC to take such unilateral action against a
corporation as well. Currently, the SEC must ask the courts
for a temporary injunction to stop such abuses.
   Under the bill's new authority, the SEC would still be
able to seek cease-and-desist authority over a corporate
violator if the company is provided with notice and an
opportunity for a hearing before the order is issued.
   The bill was tightened to relieve concerns that the SEC
would become too heavy-handed in its enforcement efforts. "We
have tried to address those concerns by clarifying the scope
of the bill in virtually every section," said Sen.
Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), who heads the securities
subcommittee.
   The bill also would allow courts to bar officers or
directors from serving in those capacities if they are found
to have violated anti-fraud laws. Earlier versions of the
bill granted that power to the SEC, but corporate groups
contended that the authority was too broad.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   California Democratic Race for Governor Pits
   Feinstein Style Against Van de Kamp Substance
   ----

<LP>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- The two-way contest for the
Democratic nomination for governor is widely seen as a battle
between substance and style, and so far style is winning.
   With the primary election only 11 days away, substance --
or at least the appearance of it -- is represented by
earnest, baby-faced John Van de Kamp, the state's
54-year-old, two-term attorney general. The stylish
candidate, almost everyone agrees, is the elegant,
fast-talking Dianne Feinstein, the 56-year-old former mayor
of San Francisco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Van de Kamp is traveling up and down the state with
charts and graphs showing how he would balance the state's
budget. He says his opponent doesn't understand such things.
   Mrs. Feinstein is telling everyone how dedicated she is to
imposing the death penalty. She says Mr. Van de Kamp, who
personally opposes state executions, can't be trusted to use
the gas chamber frequently and effectively.
   If the polls are accurate, Mrs. Feinstein and the death
penalty are edging out Mr. Van de Kamp and his charts and
graphs. But the undecided vote is large in a race that hasn't
managed, until now, to keep California voters awake at night.
And, in these last days of campaigning, highlighted by a
debate here at a TV studio on Sunset Boulevard, Mr. Van de
Kamp for the first time has put Mrs. Feinstein on the
defensive.
   "It's going to be very close," says party chairman, and
former governor, Jerry Brown.
   Waiting in the wings is the forgotten man, the GOP
gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who hasn't
any serious opposition on the June 5 ballot.
   This is serious business, or should be. California faces
major problems in financing its public services, repairing
its highways, coping with crime and drugs, and educating a
school population that speaks so many languages it rivals the
Tower of Babel.
   There are significant national political implications,
too. California will pick up as many as seven new
congressional seats following this year's census and both
parties are eager to draw the new district lines to their
partisan advantage. Republicans, especially, need their own
governor to thwart the machinations of a Democratic
legislature.
   But somehow the gubernatorial campaign seems detached from
the real world facing Californians.
   If Mrs. Feinstein isn't celebrating the death penalty,
she's attacking Mr. Van de Kamp for refusing, as Los Angeles
district attorney, to prosecute the so-called Hillside
Strangler for murder nine years ago. It's a familiar story to
Californians. A judge took the case away from Mr. Van de Kamp
and gave it to the attorney general's office, which went on
to win a murder conviction. Mr. Van de Kamp has admitted,
again and again, that he made a mistake.
   Earlier this week, Mrs. Feinstein camped outside Mr. Van
de Kamp's office and insisted to the assembled reporters and
TV cameras it isn't enough "to grudgingly confess a mistake."
   At the same time, Mr. Van de Kamp digs into history to
charge that Mrs. Feinstein left a $180 million deficit to her
successor in her last city budget, for fiscal 1989. In fact,
Mrs. Feinstein's budget message projected a surplus, which
turned into a deficit soon after Art Agnos took office as
mayor. It isn't, in any event, a compelling story for
California voters.
   And if Mr. Van de Kamp isn't urging Mrs. Feinstein to own
up to the "d-word" (deficit), he's pointing to his charts and
graphs to explain a budget proposal that is more symbolic
than real.
   "It's a campaign gimmick," says Mrs. Feinstein. "Neither
one of us is involved in this budget, and that's the real
world." She misses the point, says Mr. Van de Kamp, in a
separate interview. "You propose and you learn. This is a
challenge to see which one of us has the competence to put a
budget together. She comes up short on knowing how to get
from A to B."
   The "g-word" -- gimmick -- explains a lot about this race.
   Each candidate is backed by professional political
consultants -- Robert Shrum for Mr. Van de Kamp, Bill Carrick
and Hank Morris for Mrs. Feinstein. They have set the tone.
   Mr. Shrum, in a typical Pygmalion-like production, took
his hard-working, nuts-and-bolts candidate, who concedes,
wistfully, that he prefers to operate "on the basis of
civility," and turned him into what one critic calls a
"slash-and-burn populist."
   Mr. Van de Kamp admits that his consultants have played a
role "in seeing what you are and what you've done." But he
says he's comfortable with that. He insists he really is a
populist, having taken on the entrenched interests for years.
"Look," he says, "historically I have always stood for the
little guy."
   His strategists, seeking ways to overcome the undoubted
reality that Mr. Van de Kamp lacks verve, came up with the
idea that their candidate would sponsor three high-impact
ballot initiatives: first, Big Green, an environmental
proposal that would cut back on the use of pesticides;
second, a measure to limit legislative terms to 12 years; and
third, a crime proposal that would speed up trials and
incarcerate drug offenders in abandoned housing on surplus
military land in the desert.
   At considerable cost, Mr. Van de Kamp's campaign rounded
up the signatures and the initiatives will all be on the
ballot in November.
   "Vote for my initiatives, vote for me," says Mr. Morris,
one of Mrs. Feinstein's consultants, explaining Mr. Van de
Kamp's strategy.
   It is an interesting strategy for defeating Sen. Wilson in
the fall, but it failed to take into account the challenge by
Mrs. Feinstein in the spring. "She's been a breath of fresh
air," says Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, one of her
supporters. "She brings a lot of drama and glamour to the
campaign."
   And she struck political gold with her first TV spot. It
showed viewers dramatic footage of the event that propelled
her into office -- the assassination in 1978 of Mayor George
Moscone. And it ended with the kicker that she is the only
Democrat running for governor who's for the death penalty.
   She builds on that image by talking about the time she
walked into a corner grocery store after a holdup in which
the grocer and his guard dog were both killed. "There was
brain matter all over the canned goods," she says. This sort
of wanton killing, she adds, "must be stopped, and I'm
absolutely dedicated to doing it."
   What's happened here is that a woman noted for the
compassion with which she pulled San Francisco together
following Mr. Moscone's murder has co-opted the crime issue
from a professional prosecutor with 30 years on the job.
   Mr. Van de Kamp has tried to respond with ads criticizing
Mrs. Feinstein's record as mayor. And, when that didn't seem
to work, he began running positive ads boasting of his
accomplishments -- a move that prompted a classic line from
Mrs. Feinstein's press secretary, Dee Dee Myers: "He's
resorted to the high road in desperation."
   Mr. Van de Kamp continues to confuse some voters by
boasting of the work he has done in putting killers on Death
Row, while saying that he is personally opposed to the death
penalty. And he says that he is personally opposed to
abortion, but would never do anything to interfere with a
woman's right to choose.
   "We can't afford to have a governor who is for what he's
against and against what he is for," says Mrs. Feinstein.
   And, yet, there is a chink in Mrs. Feinstein's armor, and
Mr. Van de Kamp is finally beginning to take advantage of it.
It is simply this: She doesn't always do her homework. The
result is that in debates and in interviews, she sometimes
blunders. These last few days, she's had to retract
statements twice. "I don't think I backed down," she says. "I
clarified my positions."
   The first time, she suggested she was willing in budget
talks to negotiate away cost-of-living increases for the
blind, the needy and the disabled. She "clarified" that
statement by saying that while she would put those allowances
on the table, she wouldn't give them away. In the second, she
suggested she might consider signing a bill to ban
sex-selection abortions if they became a problem in
California. Abortion-rights groups complained sex-selection
laws are "smoke screens" for anti-abortion groups. She
"clarified" that statement by saying she would never sign
such a bill.
   "It's fairly clear," says Mr. Van de Kamp, "she has no
ideas of her own."

   Grand Met Decides
   Against the Sale
   Of Its Alpo Unit

   Grand Metropolitan PLC said it decided against selling its
Alpo Pet-foods unit because it couldn't find a buyer willing
to pay the price it sought.
   The London-based food, beverage and retailing company said
it received several bids for the Allentown, Pa., pet-food
maker, which has been on the block for three months. But it
was "unable to reach agreement as to the value of Alpo's
recently launched cat-food business."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Industry analysts suggested that Grand Met may have had
inflated expectations about the value of the business, which
ranks sixth in the domestic pet-food industry, especially the
cat-food line. They speculated that Grand Met hoped to fetch
between $600 million and $700 million for the unit, which had
sales in excess of $400 million in the year ended Sept. 30.
   "Obviously, the bone of contention with potential buyers
was cat food," said Roger Spencer, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. "It hasn't been around long enough to build
up a sustained value."
   Alpo officials said Alpo's share of the cat-food market
has steadily increased since its introduction last November.
For the 12 weeks ended April 20, Alpo claims to have snared
more than 9% of the market for premium canned cat food and
more than 5% of the dry cat-food market.
   Grand Met put the pet-food business up for sale at a time
when competition in the mature industry has been especially
fierce. Sales growth has been sluggish, reflecting pet
owners' growing preference for cats over dogs.
   Since 1983, the number of dogs in the U.S. has been steady
at around 50 million, while the number of cats has climbed
25% to 57.9 million, according to industry estimates.
   With its entry into the cat-food business, Grand Met is
betting on this trend continuing. It is also marketing its
cat food by using the popular cartoon character, Garfield, as
its spokescat.
   A spokeswoman for Grand Met said, "It makes more sense to
keep the company {and expand it} and make it increasingly
more profitable than to sell it at a price that doesn't
reflect the value of the company." Previously, the company
had said it wanted to focus on its other food businesses,
including Haagen-Daaz, Pillsbury and Green Giant brands.
   Alpo, acquired by Grand Met in 1980, was one of the last
major pet-food makers to enter the cat-food market. Its
canned dog food leads that segment of the market, although it
has shrunk in recent years, according to estimates of
analysts.
   Several companies were rumored to be among the bidders for
Alpo, including Quaker Oats Co., H.J. Heinz Co., and Nestle
SA's Carnation Co. unit.
   "Some awfully smart companies looked at it and said no,"
said PaineWebber's Mr. Spencer, who said he finds Grand Met's
reversal interesting. "Maybe we are going back to real values
in the evaluation process."

   The House's Clean-Air Bill:
   Air Bill's Cost-Benefit Data
   Look Very Foggy Up Close

   George Bush gave new visibility to the black art of
cost-benefit analysis when he drew the line with Congress on
the Clean Air bill: If the legislation costs business and
consumers more than $21 billion a year, he would reject it.
   This attempt to convert cost estimates from debating
points to political weapons helped the administration
influence provisions of the Clean Air bill, but it also put
the spotlight on just how crude these estimates of costs and
benefits truly are.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Take just one section of the proposed legislation
involving a far-reaching plan to reduce emissions of nearly
191 toxic chemicals, from acetaldehyde to xylene. On the cost
side, the Bush administration figures the price tag on the
Senate version eventually would total roughly $5.5 billion a
year. On the benefit side, the Environmental Protection
Agency predicts that between 1,100 and 2,000 fatal cases of
cancer would be avoided each year.
   Sounds precise. Unfortunately, even administration
economists concede the price tag is little more than a guess.
Much depends on how the EPA actually enforces a law that is
likely to be studded with such imprecise phrases as "maximum
achievable control technology" and "ample margin of safety."
   "We know virtually nothing about the cost of complying
with the regulations that will be written to control air
toxics," says Paul Portney, vice president of Resources for
the Future, a Washington think tank respected by both sides
of the debate. Hoping to influence the debate in Congress,
the National Association of Manufacturers has been trying to
commission a study estimating the cost to business of
complying with the law. "We haven't found anyone . . . that
has a lot of credibility out there," says Richard Siebert, an
NAM vice president.
   That doesn't stop industry from churning out frighteningly
large figures. At one point, the Business Roundtable released
a report saying that the original Senate proposal to reduce
emissions of toxic substances could cost business as much as
$64 billion a year; ultimately, the Senate passed a bill with
less onerous provisions.
   "When it is estimating the cost of compliance, industry
frequently will pick gold-plated solutions, the most
draconian solutions in the worst-case scenario and parade the
buckets of blood before the American public," complains Dan
Dudek, an Environmental Defense Fund economist.
   One problem, of course, is that estimators are aiming at a
moving target. When the Bush administration tried to figure
the costs of its own proposal, its bottom line was a range of
between $967 million and $11.67 billion a year. The
administration did agree on a misleadingly precise "best
estimate" of $4.729 billion. Nevertheless, economists at the
President's Council of Economic Advisers actually tried to
keep a running tally as White House negotiators worked to
find a compromise with Senate Democrats.
   Estimating costs is the easy part compared with the
benefits. Nobody favors pumping billions of tons of poison
into the air every year, but there is surprisingly little
consensus on how much harm this air pollution actually
causes. One of the few shreds of evidence cited in the
debate: a finding by the EPA that a subset of the toxic
chemicals covered by the legislation cause between 1,700 and
2,500 fatal cancer cases annually. The new law won't
eliminate all those cancers because it won't eliminate all
the pollution.
   EPA scientists say about 75% -- or between 1,100 and 2,000
-- of these deaths would be prevented if the bill were
enacted. John Graham, a professor of public health at Harvard
University, dissected the EPA analysis, differentiating
between studies that prove links to human cancer and those
that rely exclusively on animals. He concluded that 500 was a
more plausible number, but emphasizes the uncertainty. "The
true number could be zero. The higher bound might get as high
as 1,000," he says.
   Toxic chemicals in the air may also figure in birth
defects and in less serious cancers, but no reliable
estimates popped up during the Clean Air debate. The health
effects of living near a factory that spews toxic substances
into the air simply aren't fully understood. "You're relying
on statistical correlations," Mr. Dudek, the environmental
economist, acknowledges, "as opposed to understanding the
precise pathway through which a pollutant enters a person's
system and affects health."
   If the paucity of economic and scientific evidence on air
toxics is at one extreme in the Clean Air debate, acid rain
ought to be at the other. After all, it has been studied
intensively for more than a decade. Yet the debate over the
science and economics of combating acid rain remains intense.
   Even where there's a consensus on the surface, a heated
debate boils underneath. For instance, in estimating the cost
of cleaning up power plants, all sides to the debate rely on
a computer model of the coal and electric utility industry
that belongs to ICF Resources Inc., a Fairfax, Va.,
consulting firm. With detailed data on every power plant in
the country, it predicts how each plant would be affected by
the new law and how the coal industry would change as a
result.
   ICF says the acid-rain crackdown would cost around $4
billion a year, a clean-air surcharge on America's electric
bills averaging 2% or 3%. "It drives the debate," says Robert
Hahn, an American Enterprise Institute economist.
   But that doesn't mean that everyone actually believes the
output of the ICF model. Both Mr. Hahn and Mr. Dudek of the
Environmental Defense Fund contend the model doesn't fully
appreciate how the clean-air bill's innovative plan to allow
utilities to buy and sell the right to pollute would restrain
the eventual cost of the legislation.
   "It's the difference between a Polaroid and a video," says
Mr. Dudek. The ICF model is like a still photograph that
doesn't reflect the dynamics of the market that the new law
will create, he claims.
   Daniel Klein, senior vice president of ICF Resources,
disagrees. "The model handles this pretty easily," he says.
"All of the utilities are trying to meet their requirements
at least-cost. The model is looking at the options available
to each one," including trading pollution rights.

   There are some who persist in swimming against the tide,
long after the exercise has lost its point. Not surprisingly,
they're on the United Nations' payroll. Gert Rosenthal, head
of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America,
recently chastised Latin politicians who put their faith in
the market. "Making the state smaller does not resolve
certain basic issues, like equity," he told the Washington
Post. "Privatization is fine in certain instances, but," he
noted with a familiar smugness, "it is not something to put
on a pedestal and venerate." Under the leadership of the late
Raul Prebisch, ECLA advocated many of the statist policies
that turned a depressed region into a bankrupt one. We
suppose that facing up to the absolute failure of policies
such as "import substitution" would mean folks of the sort
who people ECLA would have to give up their jobs.

   The Americas:
   Mexican Government Strikes Out With Unions

   MEXICO CITY -- Alas, in the real world love affairs don't
have happy endings. The Mexican government and organized
labor have been lovers for more than 70 years, but the affair
is now going down the tubes. It is a story with a dramatic
beginning, a long and happy -- but sinful -- middle and a sad
ending.
   Revolutions need a lot of money, but they destroy the
productive processes that generate it. This is why they print
too much of their own currency and then force people to
accept it. In 1916 Venustiano Carranza -- father of the
modern Mexican Constitution -- retook Mexico City with all
its problems and all its costs. But no one wanted his newly
printed "infalsificables". Everyone demanded the silver and
gold of the "ancien regime." Carranza decreed that wages be
paid with his flimsy paper and the nascent labor unions went
on a general strike demanding that their wages be paid in
coin.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Carranza was outraged by "the tyranny of the unions" and
personally arrested the 11 strike leaders who came to see
him. He demanded the death penalty, invoking an 1862 law that
condemned as traitors those who refused the national currency
preferring that of the invading French army. However, he
couldn't find a judge who would impose such a harsh sentence.
When the dust settled, nobody had faced the firing squad and
the payment in coin had been resumed. Nevertheless, Carranza
was the ultimate victor. Organized labor reached the
conclusion that it could not really defeat the "federales."
If you can't beat them, join them.
   A tacit pact gradually evolved. Perhaps its terms were
never discussed, but they were clearly understood. For more
than 70 years organized labor has gone wherever the
government has led. In exchange, the government supported a
periodic increase in real wages -- till 1983 when it
unilaterally changed the pact to a one-way street. No quid,
all pro.
   The original deal sounds impossible and it was. Wages
cannot rise forever. But they did for more than 60 years. It
began during the very nadir of a country destroyed by
revolution, then civil war and finally free-for-all fighting.
The economy had nowhere to go but up. Then, in the very midst
of the world-wide Depression, the little-noticed and
long-forgotten Mexican miracle began. For 50 consecutive
years, the economy grew at an average rate of 6% per annum.
All labor contracts were renegotiated every two years, and
business -- with some arm-twisting -- found it could afford
to raise wages slightly above inflation every time. Moreover,
a low rate of inflation prevailed.
   The CTM (Confederation of Mexican Workers), en masse,
became a member of the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary
Party), the official political party. The workers were not
consulted but they probably didn't really care. Wages were
going up every two years, and fringe benefits even more. The
quota of governors, senators and congressmen from CTM ranks
was increasing over the years. The CTM and the government
were sitting in each others's laps and everybody was happy.
Then came the economic downturn of 1982, and since then
nobody has been happy.
   After 12 consecutive years of overspending, overprinting
and overborrowing the real world caught up with Mexico. By
1982, we could no longer pay our debts, keep our money in the
country or hold the line on inflation. But we eventually took
our medicine like grown-ups are supposed to. We reduced
spending (good), we cut investment to the bone (terrible), we
negotiated a debt reduction (insufficient) and we lowered our
protectonist barriers (again, good). But most of all we
tightened the belts of farmers and workers.
   By government fiat, the rise of nominal salaries was
limited to less than the increase in prices. Real wages were
thus reduced and there has been an evident lowering of living
standards. The CTM has been the faithful ally of the
government in this "dirigiste" wage erosion. And both have
lost the workers in the process. Many unions have left the
CTM and now call themselves independent. More have remained
nominal members but won't even talk to the central body's
representatives. The CTM is becoming a mere figurehead. It is
no longer a real confederation of labor unions nor is its
leadership representative. It no longer can bring in the
vote.
   In the presidential and congressional elections of 1988,
workers voted massively for the leftist opposition led by
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the son of the late President Cardenas
(1934-1940). He is uncharismatic and wooden-faced, but "the
worst enemy of my worst enemy is my best friend."
   Can the now-precarious political system survive without
the support of organized labor? The 1991 congressional
elections will answer that question. My opinion is that it
might -- for now.
   President Carlos Salinas has proved to be what the country
was demanding -- a real leader. He has gained some popularity
and a great deal of respect. If the 1988 elections were to be
held again today he would win easily, the rightist PAN would
take second place and Mr. Cardenas' PRD would be a poor
third.
   The question now is: Can support for Mr. Salinas be
translated into votes for candidates of the discredited
official party? I think it is possible. But I wouldn't bet
the family farm on it.

   House Democrats Assail Justice Agency
   Over Sentencing for Corporate Crime

   WASHINGTON -- Democrats on a House Judiciary subcommittee
challenged the Justice Department's explanation of why the
agency rescinded its longstanding support for proposed tough
new guidelines governing criminal sentencing of corporations.
   In a hearing yesterday before the House Subcommittee on
Criminal Justice, Paul Maloney, a Justice Department
official, said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in March had
given the order to rescind the department's support for the
guidelines for two main reasons.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Maloney said the department wanted to analyze newly
proposed modifications suggested by the U.S. Sentencing
Commission, which sets guidelines for federal courts. He also
said a recent endorsement of the guidelines hadn't been
cleared through "the standard review process." Specifically,
Mr. Maloney said an endorsement issued in February by the
department's then-No. 2 official was given without the
approval of the attorney general.
   He added that Mr. Thornburgh's current consideration of
the proposed guidelines "doesn't in any way represent a
repudiation of the department's {earlier} position on the
proposed sentencing guidelines."
   But the Justice Department's apparent flip-flop on the
issue took on added significance when Donald Ayer, who issued
the February endorsement, announced his resignation effective
today. He accused Mr. Thornburgh of denying him appropriate
authority and of concealing alleged deceptions by personal
aides. The attorney general has denied these charges. But one
of the personal aides involved has announced his resignation,
and another has been reassigned to less prominent duties.
   The proposed sentencing guidelines set out a range of
penalties -- some of which could total hundreds of millions
of dollars -- that federal judges would have to impose
against companies convicted of such crimes as willful
pollution.
   During the sometimes contentious questioning, the
subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.),
suggested that, in fact, Attorney General Thornburgh ordered
the endorsement withdrawn because business lobbyists, who
vehemently oppose the guidelines as being too strict, had
pressured the White House to intervene. Justice Department
officials previously acknowledged that following corporate
lobbying of the White House, President Bush's counsel
contacted Mr. Thornburgh's executive assistant, suggesting
that the sentencing guidelines get further review. But
Stephen Hart, a White House spokesman, said yesterday that
"It's simply not true" that the White House requested any
changes in the sentencing guidelines. "The charge is
groundless."
   Rep. George Gekas (R., Pa.) came to the Justice
Department's defense yesterday, saying, "It's important that
we poo-poo his {Mr. Schumer's} poo-pooing" of Mr. Maloney's
contentions.
   Attacking the Justice Department's explanations, Mr.
Schumer said that the modifications suggested by the
sentencing commission were minor and that they didn't require
significant additional review. Mr. Maloney conceded that not
all department correspondence to the sentencing commission
has been reviewed by the attorney general.
   In any case, the sentencing commission has said that
because three of its seven seats are vacant, it won't issue
the corporate guidelines until next year.

   But `Reformulated' Gasoline
   Still Faces One Hurdle:
   It Hasn't Been Invented

   The clean-air fuel of the future is still a subject of hot
debate.
   To the great dismay of the oil industry, Congress voted to
require the sale of an advanced, cleaner-burning
"reformulated" gasoline in the nation's nine smoggiest areas.
But nobody, including the industry, knows for sure what this
reformulated gasoline really is. A fuel capable of complying
with standards by the mid-1990s in proposed clean air
legislation hasn't been invented yet.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, there still is a dispute over whether to rely
only on reformulated gasoline to help clean up the air.
Non-gasoline fuels such as methanol and compressed natural
gas could play a role. The Senate bill doesn't contain a
production mandate, so the issue will have to be decided in a
House-Senate conference committee.
   The oil industry had pushed to head off new federal
requirements and alternative fuels by pressing development of
reformulated gasolines that it already has begun selling. But
Congress came up with its own formula for gasoline because
"frankly, we don't trust them," says Rep. Bill Richardson, a
New Mexico Democrat.
   The Senate stunned big oil several weeks ago by voting in
an amendment to the clean-air legislation that defines a
specific type of less-polluting gasoline to fuel autos in the
nation's nine smoggiest areas, which comprise 25% of the
total U.S. gasoline market. These cities are Los Angeles, New
York, Houston, Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee, Philadelphia,
San Diego and much of Connecticut. The formula in the Senate
bill would require oil companies to boost gasoline's oxygen
content through the use of additives such as ethanol.
   The House approved a similar amendment as part of its
version of the clean-air bill. But while the House measure
also contains a recipe for gasoline, it gives the oil
companies greater flexibility to ignore the formula if they
can produce a fuel that yields environmental benefits that
are greater than those of the recipe fuel.
   "The industry keeps screaming about reformulated gasoline,
but when you try to take them at their word they seem not to
be very serious," says Rep. Richardson, who sponsored the
House amendment. The amendments specifying a formula "are a
way to ensure they do comply."
   The oil companies already have labeled as many as seven
newly developed gasolines as reformulated, angering some
lawmakers and even some industry officials who say these
companies -- Arco, Diamond Shamrock, Conoco, Phillips,
Marathon, Shell and Exxon -- are grabbing for a piece of a
market that doesn't even exist yet.
   "It's a real stretch to call these fuels reformulated
gasoline," says Tom Cachette, deputy executive officer of
California Air Resources Board.
   All of the new "reformulated" gasolines reduce the fuel's
volatility, or tendency to evaporate, which is required in
some markets anyway. Some eliminate a portion of the more
polluting components in favor of less noxious additives. But
most are available on a very limited basis and only in
certain locations.
   Some companies, such as Shell and Exxon, "have done
precious little," says Dan McKay, editor of Octane Week, a
trade publication tracking this issue. The two oil giants
have added a splash of methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE,
but haven't cut down on aromatics or olefins, two major
offending gasoline components currently under scrutiny by
Congress. "A lot of companies blend MTBE into their gasolines
and don't pound themselves on the chest," Mr. McKay says.
"Exxon and Shell are trying to see how little they can do and
still call their gasolines reformulated."
   Oil company executives had expected more stringent air
quality standards to be imposed, but had assumed they would
be able to define the fuels to be used themselves. But
Lawrence Goldstein, executive director of the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation and an industry partisan,
concedes: "They may have moved a little too fast and hurt
themselves politically. Congress may now feel compelled to
define the game for the industry."
   Representatives of the oil and auto industries claim that
they are testing at least 25 blends of gasolines to see if
they can come up with the formula that will clean up
unhealthy emissions that currently pollute the air. But the
earliest they'll know is late summer, says Joseph Colucci, a
General Motors Corp. executive acting as co-chairman of the
study.
   Currently there are hundreds of gasolines on the market.
All have similar properties but, like fingers on a hand, each
has its own specific print, dictated by what kind of crude
oil they were made from and at what refinery they were
manufactured. Gasoline sold under the same brand name by the
same oil company may have differing amounts of aromatics or
olefins but be close enough in other properties to be sold as
the same product.
   Industry experts concede that it is possible to make a
one-formula gasoline. But refineries would have to take on
the work of petrochemical plants, breaking down each fuel
component into separate molecules and then reassembling them
according to the predetermined recipe. It's a much more
complicated process than currently practiced and, by the
industry's reckoning, might mothball one-third of the
nation's refineries. "Under that criteria, gasoline could
cost consumers $5 a gallon," says Tom Austin, an industry
consultant and former EPA official.
   Congressional staff members contend the House language on
reformulated gasoline would raise the price of gasoline by up
to five cents a gallon.

   Economic Imperative for Mideast Peace

   AMMAN -- Arab summits are generally better known for being
disputatious than for fashioning serious programs to advance
the cause of peace in the turbulent Middle East.
   Nevertheless, Arab leaders who will gather in Baghdad on
Monday have an extraordinary opportunity to construct a
platform that would bring peace to a region that has been
bedeviled by conflict for an eternity. They must be mindful,
however, that "peace" doesn't consist of politics alone: An
equally vital element of any peace settlement is sustained
economic development of our region.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To be sure, this summit is not being held under auspicious
circumstances. Last Sunday's slaying of seven Palestinians by
a crazed Israeli gunman, the subsequent violence perpetrated
by Israeli soldiers in the occupied territories, and the
disturbances that have affected several countries -- these
things could well make any peace efforts even more elusive.
   But moderate Arab states are fervently hoping that this
summit will not degenerate into yet another frustrating
talkfest. This summit must push Arabs toward realistic
prospects of talking directly with the Israelis.
   Israel has paid a heavy economic price to ensure its
survival. The Israeli economy appears headed for disaster.
Israel's budget deficit rose last year to nearly 40% of gross
domestic product. The country's high defense expenditure
diverts funds from domestic development.
   The Arab-Israeli conflict has similarly imposed heavy
demographic and economic burdens on my country, Jordan. For a
country of barely three million people to be spending $600
million annually on defense -- or 16% of GDP -- is untenable.
Israel's occupation of the West Bank after the Six-Day War of
1967 deprived Jordan of 40% of its gross national product,
while thrusting more than 400,000 refugees upon it.
   Assistance from oil-producing Arab countries to Jordan to
cope with these problems has dropped sharply: to less than
$400 million today from $1.2 billion in 1981. As the revenues
of our oil-producing neighbors declined, remittances from
expatriate Jordanians -- whose skills have helped create
modern societies in the Gulf region -- have dropped more than
20% in the past three years to less than $800 million today.
Contributing to Jordan's economic problems has been the world
decline in commodity prices, although we have made every
effort to streamline the phosphate industry, which remains
our biggest export trade item. Jordan's total external debt
has risen from $3.5 billion in 1984 to nearly $8 billion
today.
   The "intifada," or Palestinian uprising that started in
December 1987 in the West Bank and Gaza, has resulted in
Palestinians liquidating more than $250 million in Jordanian
dinars held by them as cash reserves. Jordan has suffered
heavily as a result.
   Radical politics feeds on deteriorating economic
conditions. This is to no one's benefit. All parties in the
region should be mindful of the dangers posed by the
expanding fundamentalist movement that is rapidly winning
converts among our restless and unemployed young.
   Jordan believes that while the two superpowers must assume
greater responsibility in expediting the peace process, there
must be greater regional and interregional economic
cooperation. Such cooperation would provide political
stability and also enhance the constituency for peace in the
Arab world.
   The following are the potential building blocks for wider
economic and political cooperation:
   -- The Gulf Cooperation Council. The oil resources and
revenues of the GCC members -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- continue to be a
major factor in the economic growth of the region. The
creation of such sub-regional economic clubs invites a
bilateral dialogue between manpower-exporting states such as
Jordan and the resource-rich countries of the region.
   -- The Arab Cooperation Council. A relatively new
grouping, consisting of Jordan, Egypt, Iraq and what was
until recently North Yemen, the ACC seeks to think in
practical terms about common concerns, such as water, energy,
transportation and telecommunications. Arabs and Israelis
share a common geography and history. Why not a common
economic framework that would work for the benefit of
everybody?
   -- A United Nations peace conference. The most appropriate
vehicle for a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli
conflict is an international conference under the auspices of
the U.N. The only acceptable basis for a just and lasting
settlement is a fair exchange of land for peace -- as
embodied in U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338. These resolutions
call for the withdrawal of foreign presences from the
occupied territories, and also offer implicit recognition of
Israel's sovereign existence.
   -- Regional security. Jordan calls for an Arab Summit
meeting in order to formulate a peace strategy that would
safeguard the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and the
security and stability of the Arab regional order.
   -- Big-power support. The U.S., the Soviet Union, Europe
and the parties concerned in the dispute must work in concert
to generate peace momentum. Since the Israeli settlements in
the occupied territories violate international law, the U.S.
and Europe should predicate their subsidization of the
immigration and resettlement of Soviet Jews on Israel's
freezing all settlement activity in the occupied territories.
   Jordan has genuinely been the "middle ground" for the
region, not only because of its location but also because of
its moderate and practical approaches to the many issues
bedeviling the Middle East. Regrettably, Israel hasn't chosen
to join in the spirit of accommodation. Instead, it has
chosen to distract attention from the critical issue of
peace. This time it has gathered all its resources to welcome
a new wave of immigration -- a wave that provides a powerful
case for Israeli expansionists to keep the occupied
territories.
   But not only will this new immigration exact a price by
threatening all peace initiatives -- its economic cost is
staggering. The Shamir government has asked the U.S., for
instance, for at least $300 million to meet the expenditures
of settling Soviet newcomers in Israel. The chairman of the
Jewish Agency -- the main resettlement organization --
estimates that 750,000 immigrants will arrive in Israel over
the next five to six years. Israelis have already sent more
than 360,000 invitations to Soviet Jews, and Israel is
issuing 200 visas a day in Moscow to Jewish applicants. In
the first three months of 1990 more than 17,000 Jews arrived
in Israel from the Soviet Union. This could change the
demographic identity of the occupied territories.
   To provide safeguards against a breakdown of the peace
process, the development of a sophisticated long-term
strategy is required. Like all other conflicts, the Palestine
question has shown in the past few months that it is
susceptible to compromise. Change can be hastened through a
concerted effort. Proposals must be designed to accommodate
both the political requirements of the Palestinians and the
resettlement of Soviet Jews.
   There is ample room for everybody in the Middle East --
Moslems, Jews and Christians alike. With the establishment of
a genuine peace, I see Jordan emerging as a sort of Singapore
of the region whose economic progress would have a multiplier
effect -- a staging ground for international companies
wishing to accelerate their business in the area. We have the
skilled manpower, we have a superb infrastructure, we have
political stability, and we have a strong work ethic.
   But we don't have peace. Yet.
   Jordan truly believes that regional peace is a possibility
whose time has come. We, the players in the process, mustn't
permit the opportunity to pass us by, yet again. Any takers?

   Sounds as If It Will Take More

   When a business folds, people lose their shirts. But when
a business folds and bundles, people can lose their pants as
well.
   It happened recently in the Seattle area, when Dollar
Saver Cleaner Club Inc., a chain of dry cleaning and
laundromat clubs that offered discount cleaning and delivery
for anybody paying a $20 annual membership fee, washed out.
Owners Jules and Marion Dabbous filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy-law protection and apparently split town --
without bothering to inform customers or return their
clothes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of former clients have been hung out to dry.
"There is outrage," says Paula Selis, an assistant attorney
general in Seattle. "It's rough on a person when they can't
get their clothes back from the cleaners."
   Rough indeed. Darnell Coles, an outfielder for the Seattle
Mariners baseball team, heard that the operators of his
Dollar Saver outlet had padlocked the doors and bolted,
leaving only a scribbly note on yellow legal paper
proclaiming the club permanently closed. This troubled Mr.
Coles, who had nine shirts locked inside. But he wasn't
entirely surprised.
   "They'd been taking longer and longer to return my
clothes," he says. "They'd always tell me it'd be a couple of
days, a couple more days. But I never thought they'd stiff me
and skip town."
   Rumors about the affair are spreading like a red-wine
stain. Did the Dabbouses mean to take their clients to the
cleaners all along? They do have a spotty past: Records at
the King County prosecutor's office show that the Dabbouses
pleaded guilty in 1987 to permitting prostitution at their
Relax-eena Massage Parlor. The state, sniffing for dirty
laundry, has filed suit against the Dabbouses, alleging
violations of consumer-protection laws.
   Another element of the mystery: If Dollar Saver was
legitimate, what, then, took the starch out of the operation?
Ms. Selis says the clubs had operated for about three years
and apparently had a lot of customers. "On the surface, it
looked like they were doing pretty well," she says. Ms. Selis
says her office continues to press its investigation into the
matter.
   The Dabbouses haven't come clean as to the motives for
their actions. Greg Cavagnaro, an attorney representing them
in their bankruptcy case, says they're unavailable for
comment. Meanwhile, Ms. Selis says, authorities are taking
steps to redress the balance and return clothes to their
rightful owners.

   Many Supporters of Disabled-Rights Bill
   Were Prompted by Personal Experiences

   WASHINGTON -- Many lawmakers and administration officials
supporting the civil rights law for the disabled that
Congress is about to pass were moved to act because of
experiences with family members or friends with disabilities.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, (D., Iowa), a leading sponsor of the
legislation, recalls paying a visit to his older brother
Frank in a hospital. His brother had suffered a permanent
hearing loss as a child. When he buzzed a nurse to come to
his room, a voice over a two-way speaker said, "Can I help
you?" His calls for assistance went unanswered until Sen.
Harkin reminded the nurses their patient was deaf.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I can still remember people referring to him as deaf and
dumb," says Mr. Harkin. "Well, deaf people aren't dumb." He
says one motivation for pushing to strengthen the rights of
the disabled was hearing their view that, "We can take care
of ourselves as long as you give us the opportunities."
   The bill passed by the House Tuesday and one previously
approved by the Senate would require access for the disabled
in public places and bar discrimination in hiring. The
legislation, which President Bush is expected to sign after a
House-Senate conference, also has drawn personal support from
within both the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   Late in his tenure, President Reagan named a 15-member
commission that made recommendations for disability
legislation that paved the way for the current measures. Mr.
Reagan became exposed to the needs of the disabled through
the injury to his press secretary James Brady, who was
wounded in an assassination attempt on the president.
   President Bush's continuing support has been influenced
by, among others, Evan Kemp, who uses a wheelchair and who
Mr. Bush recently named to be chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. And Mr. Bush's point man
on the legislation has been Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh, who has a son who as an infant suffered brain
damage in a car accident.
   Along the way, numerous lawmakers have cited personal
involvement that they say helped them understand the needs of
the disabled. "We just want an opportunity to be able to live
and be able to have an opportunity to work," former Rep. Tony
Coelho, (D., Calif.), who has epilepsy, told his colleagues.
   Rep. Steny Hoyer (D., Md.), who took over for Mr. Coelho
as the chief sponsor of the House bill, has a wife with
epilepsy. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, (R., Wis.), married his
wife six years after she was in an automobile accident that
left her paralyzed from the waist down. "I live with a
handicapped person every day of my life," he says.
   Among other lead backers of the legislation, Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D., Mass.), has a son whose leg was amputated above
the knee because of a rare form of cancer in 1973; Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch (R., Utah), had a brother-in-law who contracted both
types of polio in college and became a wheelchair user; and
Sen. Robert J. Dole (R., Kan.), has limited use of his right
arm and limited feeling in his left hand because of a World
War II injury.
   The lawmakers say their support for the law goes beyond
their personal involvement, however. And a few lawmakers say
they oppose the bills despite personal experience with the
needs of those with disabilities. Rep. Bud Shuster, (R.,
Pa.), whose mother used a wheelchair, opposed the House bill,
mainly because of a provision requiring all buses to have
lifts.
   "I strongly support trying to improve the situation for
the disabled," says Mr. Shuster. "I have banged my knuckles
more times than I can remember," he says of trying to get his
mother's chair through doorways that were too small. But the
requirement for costly lifts, he argues, will deflect needed
monies away from door-to-door transportation services that so
many disabled rely upon.

   NEW YORK -- U.S. Treasury bond prices fell following
lukewarm demand for an $8.5 billion issue of government
notes, which helped break a string of records in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.
   The industrial average closed 0.71 point lower at 2855.55
in moderately active trading. Broader market indexes also
fell. Long-term Treasury bond prices fell three-eighths of a
point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 of face amount. The dollar
was mixed against major foreign currencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices headed lower in the morning after the
government said the economy grew only 1.3% in the first
quarter, instead of 1.8% as expected.
   News of a slower economy usually is bullish for bonds,
because it may portend lower interest rates; bond prices move
in the opposite direction of rates. But much of the
slower-than-expected growth was attributed to a drop in
inventories, which suggests businesses may step up production
to replenish supplies. That action would strengthen the
economy, and possibly boost interest rates.
   However, bond prices recovered to move slightly higher
until shortly after the 1 p.m. EDT auction of five-year,
two-month notes. Rumors of weak demand for the notes drove
prices lower for the rest of the day, and stocks followed.
   One reason the Treasury note auction didn't go well was
little participation by Japanese investors, who are finding
attractive yields in their home market. The average yield on
the notes auctioned yesterday was 8.54%. The yield rose
immediately afterward, indicating that dealers had to cut
prices to sell them.
   Opposing influences are keeping the bond market from
establishing a clear direction, said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp., in Albany, N.Y.
Because of mounting evidence during the past few weeks that
the economy is weakening and inflation seems in check, bond
prices have rallied as interest rates eased. But, he
observed, there is a limit on how low rates can go and still
be competitive with West German rates, which have remained
high.
   This ambivalence also is starting to affect the stock
market, where "it's a real struggle between the bears and the
bulls," Mr. Johnson said.
   He expects both stocks and bonds to continue drifting
aimlessly until a week from today, when the government report
on employment growth and unemployment in May will give
investors their next significant reading on economic trends.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in active trading, with 155.1 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers, 791 to 725.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.60%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar ended mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was at 1.6830 marks and 151.05 yen, compared with
1.6765 marks and 151.45 yen Wednesday.

   Roger Hall's Breakaway Bases
   Protect Ankles in Slides;
   But Baseball Isn't Buying

   ELIZABETHTOWN, Pa. -- Baseball has many heroes. Roger Hall
isn't one of them.
   He might, however, hold two baseball records, if
statisticians knew about them. He's probably slid into bases
more times than Lou Brock, and he's probably toiled more
often in the field of dreams than Ray Kinsella.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For years, Mr. Hall has been tinkering on what he calls
"Rogers Break Away Bases," baseball bases that are designed
to pop up under extraordinary force and thus reduce injuries
that can result from bad slides. He began his crusade when he
watched a friend tear out a kneecap sliding into a standard,
stationary base. "It was horrible," the wiry former infielder
and Elizabethtown College volunteer coach recalls. "I went
right out to find bases that might be safer. But I couldn't
find anything and decided I'd have to rig something
together."
   In Mr. Hall's perfect world, his base would work something
like this: Rickey Henderson gets a late jump trying to steal
second and has to slide hard to avoid a strong throw from the
catcher.
   Ordinarily, players hate to slam into traditional bases
this way for fear of injuring a knee, ankle or wrist, when
they slide headfirst. But this ball park is equipped with
"Rogers Break Away Bases."
   The Oakland outfielder's wrist rams into the base well
ahead of the tag. The sell-out crowd gasps, thinking he'll be
hurt. Instead of the all-star's joints buckling, the base
gives with a pop-pop-pop, detaching completely from the
rubber plugs holding it down on the field. Mr. Henderson, who
maintains contact with the flush-mounted rubber plate still
in the ground, stands unhurt and waves to the cheering crowd.
   It's a good dream, one that could have made Mr. Hall a
hero. But though he's found success in one unlikely sector --
the U.S. government -- baseball has been mostly unresponsive.
Minnesota Twins Manager Tom Kelly says flatly, "Who needs
them?"
   According to medical reports, plenty of people do. A
two-year University of Michigan study found Mr. Hall's bases
virtually eliminated base-path injuries on amateur diamonds
around Ann Arbor, Mich., while fields that used traditional
stationary bases saw one sliding injury every 14 games.
   In 1988, the Centers for Disease Control calculated that
breakaway bases could save $2 billion a year in medical
treatments to the more than 40 million Americans playing
organized ball every year. That's more money than the federal
government spent last year on AIDS research and treatment.
   What Mr. Hall didn't realize is that change comes slower
to the national pastime than pitches from a sore-armed
reliever. The National Hockey League adopted detachable,
magnetized goals five years ago to cut down on injuries. The
National Basketball Association went to breakaway rims when
ill-timed slam dunks raised the potential for player harm.
   But baseball treats its past with holy reverence, and the
15-inch-square bags that give the game its name are sacred.
"Baseball looks at innovations like these bases and asks, `If
the game has worked for the past 100 years, why change it?'"
says Bill Deane, a history reseacher at the National Baseball
Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y. "It's a very
conservative sport."
   Indeed, the Official Baseball Rules covering bases haven't
changed significantly in the past 104 years, though people
have often tried. In 1875, John C. O'Neill of St. Louis
patented an "Enunciating Base." It featured a built-in bell
so "the touching of the base by the runner is clearly
announced to the umpire," thereby avoiding "dissatisfaction
and squabbles arising from erroneous observations and
decisions."
   More than 70 years later, two inventors devised a base
without "hazardous corners and side walls." Baseball has also
seen detachable bases -- in velcro, which didn't work once
they got dusty, and with magnets, made by the inventor of the
detachable hockey net.
   Mr. Hall has spent 17 years perfecting his base. In the
early stages of his work, he sold his house and moved with
his wife, Wilma, into a cramped mobile home. There he tested
model after model, sliding into them on his small, sloping
lawn. To keep going, he took odd jobs, like painting houses
and running deliveries around this small, Pennsylvania Dutch
town. He sold his wife's Ford Pinto, and, for a time, gave up
meat.
   "It got to the point where we couldn't afford to go to the
dentist and I stopped buying clothes for myself," Mrs. Hall
says. "It was very depressing, but something said to us to go
on a little further. His dream was so strong and I just
prayed the Lord would carry us through."
   Last month, the Halls thought some of their prayers had
been answered when top officials from two major league teams,
the Detroit Tigers and Toronto Blue Jays, expressed serious
interest in trying the bases. The Blue Jays used them on
fields at their Dunedin, Fla., spring training complex. Both
clubs agreed to use them with some of their minor league
clubs.
   "If we save just one player who the organization's spent a
lot of money to develop, these bases are worth the money,"
says Bob Gilson, general manager of the London Tigers,
Detroit's class AA farm team. "Then when these guys get to
the pros and start earning $1 million a year the stakes get
even higher. The players become assets teams have to
protect."
   In one recent game, a London Tiger outfielder thought he
was certain to injure his legs on a hard slide into third.
   "I knew I was going to jam something, but then the base
just came off and tumbled a few feet away," says 23-year-old
Steve Green. "Those bases may have kept me from really
hurting myself, but I wouldn't have known they were there
otherwise."
   But Mr. Hall had his sights set on the majors, not the
minors. Problem is, by the time a player is in the big
leagues, he knows how to slide. Detroit shortstop Alan
Trammell says he can't think of anyone who was seriously hurt
because of the traditional bases, held down by steel posts in
cement anchors. American League President Bobby Brown wrote
this to the Centers for Disease Control: "In my experience,
sliding injuries . . . resulting from abrupt violent contact
with the base by the runner has not been a problem in
professional baseball."
   Still, there are millions of Americans playing ball in the
minor or little leagues or on city and suburban recreational
fields. Wouldn't their organizations want to prevent
base-path injuries to baby Ruths and middle-aged Mantles?
   The Little League and the American Softball Association
seem to have nothing against the concept, but they want
royalties in exchange for endorsements. The Little League
asks 5% on the sale of each base. It's a price the
financially strapped Mr. Hall says he can't possibly pay.
   The city of Tucson, Ariz., has been a firm believer in Mr.
Hall's bases. But recently, city officials sent back a number
of them saying they had come unglued. The quality problems
scared a lot of recreational directors on thin budgets; a set
of three Break Away bases costs nearly $400, compared with
$80-$160 for ordinary ones.
   Mr. Hall says quality will no longer be a problem, now
that he's finally wrested his product from the company that
was producing them.
   Though spurned by the majors so far, Mr. Hall did find one
big-league fan: the U.S. government. Last year, the safety
benefits of breakaway bases were the subject of a House
Appropriations subcommittee hearing. Testimony there led to
the use of the Rogers Break Away Base at several military
bases and federal penitentiaries.
   Keith Marshall, sports specialist at a minimum-security
prison in Florida, praises Mr. Hall's bases: "People come
into an institution like this not knowing how to slide, and
you get plenty of ankle injuries in the intramurals and
leagues and tournaments we have with outside teams," he says.
"I'm a firm believer."

   Chrysler Corp.
   Treasurer Is Said
   To Plan to Quit
   ---
   Zuckerman Tells Associates
   He Expects to Leave,
   But Timing Is Unclear

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Frederick W. Zuckerman, Chrysler
Corp.'s treasurer and day-to-day link with the investment
community, is preparing to quit the No. 3 U.S. auto maker.
   Persons familiar with his plans say that Mr. Zuckerman, 56
years old, has told them he expects to leave. But these
persons add that Mr. Zuckerman hasn't specified where he's
going or the timing of his move. One co-worker said his
departure is probably more than a month away, however.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Zuckerman had "no comment" about any move when reached
by telephone in his office yesterday. "We don't confirm or
deny rumors like that," he said.
   Last week, Michael N. Hammes, also a vice president,
resigned as head of Chrysler's international operations to
take the top position at Black &amp; Decker Corp.'s core
power-tools division. The departures of the two men aren't
believed to be related, but it couldn't be determined why Mr.
Zuckerman decided to leave.
   Mr. Zuckerman joined Chrysler in 1979 during the darkest
of the auto maker's dark days. He acted as Chrysler's liaison
with the federal board that monitored Chryler's loan
guarantees. He also served as a financial adviser during
labor negotiations.
   He is currently responsible for Chrysler's pension funds
and for its relations with commercial banks. He recently
oversaw the $1 billion bond offering related to Chrysler's
sale-leaseback deal for its Auburn Hills, Mich., technology
center.
   The voluble native New Yorker is popular among investment
bankers and the press because of his financial acumen and
candor. That candor has, however, sometimes caused
consternation among his superiors at Chrysler.
   Just days after the stock market crash in 1987, he told
the Dow Jones News Service he was cutting the Chrysler
pension fund's stock and bond portfolio because "the dollar
will go to hell. Therefore, interest rates will go to hell."
   "You ain't seen nothing yet," he added. "I do not believe
it is politically possible to do what the country has to do
to reassure the world financial community that we will . . .
run our fiscal affairs in a responsible manner."
   Chrysler quickly put out a "clarification," which quoted
Mr. Zuckerman as saying he "was giving my personal opinion of
the overall economic situation, and trying to wake up the
people in Washington. Obviously there are good buys in the
market. I'm buying Chrysler {stock} today."
   Another example came early last year, when Mr. Zuckerman
told securities analysts in New York the company believed
"earnings in each quarter of 1989 will be greater than those
in each corresponding quarter of 1988," despite new
incentives. The new-car market soured soon after, however,
and Chrysler ended the year with its largest quarterly loss
ever after a $577 million one-time charge for shrinking
company operations.
   Prior to joining Chrysler, Mr. Zuckerman spent 12 years in
financial management at International Business Machines Corp.
Prior to that, he spent almost eight years at Ford Motor Co.
   While at Ford, he worked with a number of his current
fellow Chrysler executives. Among them: Vice Chairman Gerald
Greenwald, who once reported to Mr. Zuckerman as a financial
planner when Mr. Zuckerman was controller of the Ford
Division's parts and service operations.

   Amtrak Spending Bill of $1.4 Billion
   For Next Two Years Is Vetoed by Bush

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush vetoed a bill authorizing
$1.4 billion in Amtrak spending for the next two fiscal
years, saying that a provision requiring increased government
review of freight-railroad takeovers represented a "step
backward for the entire rail industry."
   The disputed provision would have given the Interstate
Commerce Commission jurisdiction to review proposals by
non-railroad companies to acquire any of the nation's 16
largest freight railroads.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ICC already has the authority to review the
acquisition of an entire railroad or a segment of it by
another railroad. It also has authority to review the
purchase of a piece of a railroad by a non-railroad company.
But it may not review the proposed takeover of an entire
railroad by a non-rail company -- a loophole that needed
closing, according to the proponents of the provision.
   President Bush disagreed, saying in his veto message to
Congress that the provision was "an unwarranted regulatory
roadblock to financial restructuring of the industry."
   Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen said that, as a result of
the veto, "no trains are going to grind to a halt." But he
complained that it clouds Amtrak's financial future, making
it more difficult for the government-owned passenger railroad
to raise private capital.
   Prospects for a congressional override of the veto, which
would require two-thirds votes by both the House and the
Senate, are hard to gauge. The House passed the bill by an
overwhelming 322-93, but the Senate approved it on a voice
vote, so the depth of support isn't clear. Since President
Bush has taken office, Congress hasn't overridden any of his
10 previous vetoes.
   The Amtrak bill included authorization of $630 million for
fiscal 1989, which ended last Sept. 30, $656 million for
fiscal 1990, $684 million for fiscal 1991 and $712 million
for fiscal 1992. Congress has already appropriated funds for
the railroad for 1989 and 1990; the vetoed bill includes
authorizations for those years simply for bookkeeping
reasons.
   The administration, in its January budget proposal, hadn't
proposed any funding for Amtrak. But President Bush didn't
cite funding levels as a reason to veto the authorization
measure.
   Authorizing legislation defines which programs the
government may carry out and sets spending ceilings for them,
while appropriating legislation funds the programs.

   House Panel Votes
   To Freeze Target
   Prices of Grains

   WASHINGTON -- The House Agriculture Committee, bowing to
budget pressure, discarded a proposal to give grain farmers
an additional $6.5 billion in subsidies over the next five
years.
   The lawmakers, led by Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza
(D., Texas), continued to hold the line on farm spending,
voting unanimously to freeze so-called target prices for
wheat and feed grains at current levels from fiscal 1991
through 1995. The committee signaled a new era of frugalness
last week as it voted to freeze target prices for cotton and
rice and tentatively agreed to freeze grain target prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The committee also voted to establish a marketing-loan
program for soybeans, sunflowers and other oilseed crops, but
with the proviso that it would operate at no cost to the
government.
   Many farm-state lawmakers had wanted to tie target prices
for commodities to farm production costs, but that would have
added $6.5 billion above the baseline spending level.
Instead, the committee adopted a plan that would freeze
target prices for wheat at $4 a bushel, corn at $2.75, barley
at $2.36 and oats at $1.45.
   However, in years when the U.S. is expected to import more
oats than it exports, the agriculture secretary would be
authorized to allow farmers to harvest oats on land that
otherwise would be taken out of production to prevent
surpluses of other commodities. Lawmakers hope this provision
will provide an incentive to reverse the prolonged decline in
oat production.
   Under the farm program, the government dispenses
deficiency payments if market prices fall short of target
prices.
   After lengthy debate, the committee also adopted a plan to
give farmers a free hand to plant a variety of crops,
including experimental crops with industrial uses, on 25% of
the land they customarily devote to cotton, rice, wheat, feed
grains and oilseeds.
   But to mollify soybean processors and the American Soybean
Association, the lawmakers decided against allowing farmers
to plant such subsidized crops as cotton and corn on oilseed
acreage. The processors and the trade group fears a drop in
soybean production.
   But farmers who take advantage of this planting
flexibility provision wouldn't be eligible for subsidy
payments on that land.
   Last week, the lawmakers tentatively agreed to a 20%
flexibility provision.
   Committee staffers said freezing target prices would have
negligible impact on food prices.

   The House's Clean-Air Bill:
   Big Oil May Have Misfired
   In Heavy Lobbying Drive

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Big oil pulled out too many guns too late in
an unprecedented, multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign to
defeat a single provision of the clean-air bill.
   "The massive oil lobby failed because it lacked
credibility, and it was senseless overkill," said Rep. Bill
Richardson (D., N.M.), co-author of the amendment, which
requires the use of an additive, such as ethanol, to make
cleaner-burning gasoline in the nation's most polluted areas.
With some changes, Mr. Richardson's reformulated-gasoline
amendment was incorporated into the clean-air package passed
by the House late Wednesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the passage of the Richardson amendment was a
setback for the once invincible oil lobby in Congress, it was
a showcase effort by an emerging powerhouse -- the gasohol
lobby. Ethanol producers and farm groups -- which produce the
grain used to make ethanol -- lobbied furiously for the
Richardson amendment.
   In an unusual battle of advertisements, the two lobbies
bitterly attacked each other. Blasting the Richardson
amendment as "an environmental Frankenstein," the American
Petroleum Institute here claimed in a $1 million newspaper ad
campaign that the amendment was also a subsidy for the
"high-octane ethanol lobby." The Nebraska Gasohol Committee
and other ad-hoc gasohol lobby groups countered with
newspaper ads headlined: "Big Oil is giving America the Big
Lie."
   "Ordinarily, we do not go to the public with this kind of
advertising," said Arthur Wiese, the American Petroleum
Institute's vice president for public affairs. The ad
campaign, which began May 8, was agreed to at a CEO-level
meeting of oil executives after the Senate approved clean-air
legislation in early April.
   The oil chieftains had been caught off guard by the
last-minute passage in the Senate of a similar,
reformulated-gasoline amendment sponsored by Sen. Thomas
Daschle (D., S.D.). The decision to use high-profile lobbying
tactics was reached because, Mr. Wiese explained, "There was
concern that the message was not getting through."
   Besides the ads, several big oil companies mounted
expensive, so-called grass-roots lobbying campaigns, asking
their employees, dealers and stockholders to deluge key House
members with mail opposing the Richardson amendment. Atlantic
Richfield Co. and Chevron Corp. set up special 800 telephone
numbers for their stockholders to send prepaid mailgrams to
Congress.
   The American Petroleum Institute, meawhile, also
circulated studies that discounted the environmental benefits
of the reformulated gasoline. One study, prepared by a
California environmental consulting group and paid for by the
API, claimed that the reformulated gasoline would cut carbon
monoxide emissions only modestly, while causing a rise in
harmful nitrogen oxides.
   But in many ways, all these efforts came too late. When
the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted on the
amendment in late March, the cleaner-fuel measure received
many more votes than expected. The panel's chairman, John
Dingell (D., Mich.), was -- along with the auto industry --
opposed to it. The amendment was defeated by only one vote,
22-21.
   With almost certain prospects for passage on the House
floor, the amendment, with some changes, was revived and
incorporated into the clean-air bill during intense
negotiations last weekend.
   "The oil industry thought they had this bill wrapped up,"
said Zoe Schneider, an environmental lobbyist. "They were
silent until the last minute and then drowned members and
their constituents with advertising. Members don't respond
well to such heavy-handed tactics." Dan Weiss, a lobbyist for
the Sierra Club, accused the oil companies of "bombing
Congress with scare tactics."
   Even one oil-industry lobbyist, who asked not to be named,
conceded that some of the ads, particularly those that
attacked Mr. Richardson by name, may have backfired. Mr.
Wiese of API defended the ads, saying they were effective.
   The oil and gasohol industries weren't alone in resorting
to paid advertising to get their points of view across. The
Clean Air Working Group, a coalition of oil, auto and other
business groups, advertised heavily against the entire
clean-air bill for months. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association spent close to $100,000 on a radio and print
campaign to defeat an amendment that would require the auto
industry to manufacture one million alternative-fueled
vehicles. A scaled-down version of the amendment, calling for
a pilot manufacturing program for the alternative-fueled
vehicles, was included in the clean-air compromise that
cleared the House.
   William Fay, administrator for the Clean Air Working
Group, said industries opposed to the bill should have done
more advertising and lobbying earlier in the fight. "I've
been horribly critical of how industry handled this," he
said. "We have a strong record of cleaning up the
environment. We needed to toot our own horn more."

   B&amp;C Intends to Sell
   Exco Brokerage Unit
   To Improve Finances

   LONDON -- British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings PLC, the
troubled U.K. financial services group, said yesterday it
plans to sell its money, government-securities and
stock-brokerage subsidiary, Exco International PLC.
   Exco operates in 17 major financial centers and forms one
of the core businesses of B&amp;C. The unit is one of the larger
players in the London money-broking business, a professional
interbank market in which several big firms function as
intermediaries among trading banks and financial
institutions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decision follows last month's announcement that B&amp;C
intends to sell various assets in an attempt to strengthen
its finances in the wake of massive losses at its Atlantic
Computers subsidiary.
   B&amp;C is writing off the whole of its #550 million ($931.4
million) investment in the subsidiary and is moving to sell
as much as #750 million of its own assets to reduce group
debt to more manageable levels of #250 million.
   The latest set of results -- for the year ended Dec. 31,
1988 -- show that Exco's pretax profit declined 39% to #48
million from #79 million the year before and that its sales
rose just 3% to #205 million from #199 million. Its results
for 1989 have been delayed due to its current financial woes.
B&amp;C paid #650 million for Exco in 1986.
   In 1988, B&amp;C's total pretax profit slipped 6% to #122.8
million from #130.9 million while sales rose 5.3% to #968.8
million from #919.7 million.
   Exco may attract a price of between #230 million and #240
million, or roughly eight times recent pretax earnings,
according to analysts at London securities firm Smith New
Court. The estimate comes despite previous B&amp;C views that the
business could fetch #300 million or more. Said one analyst:
"The world and his wife may have a look, but once you get to
the end of the day, only a few people may want to bid."

   Market Gains in Contrast to Big Board;
   Technologies Continue to Spur Rise

   Over-the-counter stocks rose buoyantly for the 11th
consecutive session. But traders warned the market's rally
could stumble today because of a pessimistic earnings outlook
released last night by software maker Adobe Systems.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.42 to 458.29, up 0.31%,
in contrast to the 0.71 slip in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Advancing shares led decliners, 1,043 to 892, as
volume fell to 174.3 million shares from 188.7 million
Wednesday.

   Adobe, based in Mountain View, Calif., announced after the
market closed that it expects earnings for the second quarter
ending June 1 to be lower than its expectations and analysts'
estimates. Adobe shares plunged about 15 in "third market"
after-hours trading to a range of 32 1/2 to 35 1/2, said
Jerry Newman, institutional trader for Cowen &amp; Co. in San
Francisco. Adobe closed in Nasdaq trading at 50 1/2, up 1
1/2.
   Mr. Newman cautioned that the after-hours drop in Adobe
may spill over to some other technology shares, particularly
software stocks. However, he said that he expects to see
profit-taking, rather than "panic selling."
   Even before the Adobe news, traders were expecting some
profit-taking in the OTC market today because of the
prolonged run-up and the three-day weekend.
   Jerry Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter
Reynolds, echoing Mr. Meisler, said he expects some investors
will take profits this morning before leaving early for the
three-day Memorial Day weekend. "I'm still sitting here with
a lot of `buy' orders, but they've become a little pricey at
this point," he said, echoing Mr. Meisler. Both men said
they're seeing buy orders for smaller stocks from large
institutions.
   While larger stocks are leading the OTC market's recent
gains, acquisition interest in smaller OTC companies is
finally attracting some investors to those shares, said
Binkley Shorts, portfolio manager of the Over-The-Counter
Securities Fund, Fort Washington, Pa. The average
capitalization of companies in the $300 million fund is $60
million.
   "There's a breath of life in small-cap" stocks fueled by
bargain hunters looking for companies to buy, he said in an
interview. Companies such as Stockholder Systems, COBE
Laboratories and Neeco recently agreed to be acquired, he
noted. Others, such as Child World, have hired investment
bankers to explore "strategic alternatives." And some
companies, such as Horizon Industries, are trying to fight
off potential takeover threats, he added.
   Technology shares continued to rise yesterday amid
analysts' recommendations.
   Dell Computer moved into the most actives list after the
Austin, Texas, personal computer maker reported net income
for the first quarter ended May 4 rose to 28 cents a share
from 11 cents a year earlier. Dell gained 1 7/8 to 12 on 2.2
million shares.
   Novell jumped 4 3/4 to 49 on 2.9 million shares after the
Provo, Utah, maker of personal computer networks reported
late Thursday that net income for the second quarter ended
April 28 jumped to 60 cents a share from 35 cents a year
earlier. The strong performance prompted Shearson analyst
Maria F. Lewis to upgrade her short-term investment opinion
on the stock to "attractive" from "neutral." The analyst also
said that Novell's "increasing status as a benchmark
technology issue" makes it likely the stock will continue to
perform well as technology stocks come back into vogue.
   Lotus added 2 3/4 to 36 3/4 on 1.5 million shares. The
stock received favorable comments from Cowen &amp; Co. analyst
Mary Meeker, who repeated her "buy" opinion on the stock.
Also, the New York Times favorably profiled a new software
program developed by the Cambridge, Mass., company.
   Among other technology issues, Quantum gained 1 3/4 to 22
5/8. Shearson analyst Doug van Dorsten said the Milpitas,
Calif., disk drive maker's sales and earnings could grow 35%
to 50% over the next 12 to 18 months. Mr. van Dorsten
upgraded his opinion on Quantum to a near-term "buy" from
"attractive."
   Players International rose 1 1/16 to 5 1/8 after the
Calabasas, Calif., gaming-services company said it expects to
report pretax operating income for the fiscal year ended
March 31 of $2 million, up from $655,000 in the previous
year.
   Shares of National Media tumbled 1 3/8 to 10 1/2. William
Campbell, vice president and secretary of the provider of
marketing services, told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report he heard that an investment newsletter issued a "sell"
recommendation on the stock late Wednesday. Mr. Campbell also
cited speculation that earnings for fiscal 1990 ended in
March will be disappointing. However, he said there's no
truth to that speculation and added that he remains
comfortable with estimates that earnings will be reported at
$1 a share for the fiscal year, up from 28 cents in fiscal
1989.

company.
   In April, Sikes agreed to be acquired by Premark for

Moreover, Premark will purchase 861,136 Class B Sikes common
shares for $26.78 apiece.

   The two complaints alleged that Sikes' directors had
breached their fiduciary duties by failing to obtain the

for Class A shares and will reduce to $3 million from $5
million a fee payable to Premark.
   Premark, based in Deerfield, Ill., markets consumer and

   WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision said a
federal judge denied a request by Imperial Savings
Association, San Diego, which sought an injunction barring
regulators from placing the thrift in receivership. Imperial
is already under government conservatorship.
   Imperial, a unit of Imperial Corp. of America, asked for
the injunction in the wake of a March ruling involving
another thrift. In the earlier ruling, a district court said
that the top savings-and-loan regulator hadn't been properly
approved by Congress and thus couldn't order that thrifts be
taken over by the government. Congress then moved quickly to
approve a new head of the Office of Thrift Supervision,
Timothy Ryan, in April and made that argument moot.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said U.S. District Judge
Judith Keep in San Diego ruled that Imperial "hadn't shown
its arguments were likely to succeed, and that the potential
harm to Imperial was outweighed by the harm to the public
that could result."
   Under conservatorship, the government takes management
control of the thrift. Under receivership, the government
wipes out the owners' interests in thrift and can sell the
assets. The OTS didn't say whether it plans to place Imperial
in receivership.

   MILAN, Italy -- Piero Barucci, the president of the
Italian Banking Association (ABI), was nominated yesterday to
replace the long-serving Lucio Rondelli as new managing
director of state bank Credito Italiano, ending weeks of
political maneuvering over the appointment.
   Mr. Barucci's nomination, one of several affecting the top
management of both Credito Italiano and its sister state bank
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), was a late choice after
protracted discussions between the bank, the state holding
company Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) and
political parties in Rome.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Barucci, 56 years old, has been president of the
Tuscan bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena since 1983, a job he
will now have to give up, as well as a professor of political
economy at the Universities of Florence and Siena, and ABI
president since 1987.
   The nomination came at a board meeting of IRI in Rome
yesterday, and was announced as the Credito Italiano annual
shareholders' meeting was already in progress in Genoa.
   While IRI nominates top officials in the banks under its
control, they still have to be formally approved by the banks
themselves. IRI owns 65% of Credito Italiano, which is quoted
on the Milan Bourse, and the bank's board is expected to meet
in the next few days to discuss the nomination.
   Mr. Rondelli, who had been managing director for 21 years,
was leaving due to having reached the mandatory retirement
age of 65. He reportedly declined an offer of a vice
presidency of the bank with some executive functions.

   CMS Wins Round
   In Continuing Bid
   To Transfer Assets

   A Michigan appellate court has ruled that state regulators
don't have authority to prohibit CMS Energy Corp. from
transferring $1.5 billion in assets out of its utility
subsidiary to the parent corporation.
   The ruling is unlikely to be the last word in a running
dispute between CMS and Michigan officials, both parties said
yesterday. CMS wants to use the assets to expand its
unregulated energy businesses and to buy back stock. State
regulators say the assets should be used only to improve the
financial footing of its regulated utility subsidiary,
Consumers Power Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Conflicting rulings have sent CMS's stock on a roller
coaster ride. It plunged $2.375, to $28.625 a share, after
Wednesday's order by the Michigan Public Service Commission
prohibiting the transfer. The stock eased yesterday morning,
but after word of the appeals court decision reached the
markets, CMS shares recovered to close at $29.125 each, up 50
cents, in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading.
   CMS Energy officials said that because of the likelihood
of further litigation, they have put on hold their plans to
spend the $1.5 billion.
   Consumers Power received $1.2 billion in interest-bearing
notes and a $341 million equity stake last month from its
partners in the Midland Cogeneration Venture. The
cogeneration venture is a once-failed nuclear-power plant now
converted to a gas-fired cogeneration facility.
   The public service commission's order said the notes
couldn't be transferred from Consumers Power to CMS Energy,
but instead Consumers Power must use the funds, "in ways that
will secure {Consumers Power's} financial health."
   But a three-judge panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals
in Lansing said the utility regulators didn't have the
authority to set such limitations. State officials said they
haven't decided on their next move, but still believe they
have authority to restrict allocation of the funds.
   Although the appeals-court ruling clearly is in CMS's
favor, company officials said the prospects of further
litigation mean shareholders won't soon gain the benefits of
the $1.2 billion in notes.
   "There's still some other shoes to fall," said John W.
Clark, a CMS senior vice president. "There's still the issue
of who's running this company. Lansing {where state
regulators are} or Dearborn," where CMS's headquarters is
located.
   State regulators contend Consumers Power conceded
oversight authority for the $1.5 billion in 1985 when the
company was on the verge of bankruptcy after sinking $4.1
billion into the failed Midland nuclear-power venture. In
return for a special rate increase to ease its financial
problems, CMS agreed to allow the public service commission
to control the use of any proceeds derived from the sale of
the failed power plant's assets.
   CMS officials contend they have fulfilled the state's
requirements by getting Consumers Power back on sound
financial footing and by retiring $1.9 billion in debt. Any
further extension of state authority is meddling, CMS
executives say.

   Boesky Took Half
   Of Federal Penalties
   As Tax Deduction

   Ex-Wall Street Speculator
   Paid $100 Million to Settle
   His Insider-Trading Case

   Ivan F. Boesky conceded under cross-examination that the
$100 million in penalties and disgorgement of profits that he
paid the government still left him with money, and that he
was able to deduct half the money he paid the government on
his 1986 tax returns.
   Mr. Boesky, who was was cross-examined for a second day by
defense lawyer Thomas Puccio in the trial of John A. Mulheren
Jr., admitted that he was forced to give up only a portion of
the profits he derived illegally as a result of the November
1986 plea-bargain agreement in his insider-trading case. He
said, however, that he couldn't recall how much money he had
left after paying the penalties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He also said he couldn't remember what illegal trades he
made before his plea, how much money he was worth at the
time, or whether he transferred personal assets to his wife
and children.
   He couldn't recall many details of his life as a famous
Wall Street stock speculator, or his illegal dealings with
former investment bankers Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel,
both of whom have pleaded to insider-trading-related
felonies.
   But Mr. Boesky said he remembered "very well" a March 1986
trade he did with Mr. Mulheren that he said was "designed to
help repay an obligation Mr. Mulheren's firm had to our
firm," money owed as a result of illegal trades. Mr. Boesky
also said he recalled receiving inside information from
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond wizard Michael
Milken. Mr. Milken recently pleaded guilty to six felony
counts in connection with fraudulent securities trades done
with Mr. Boesky and others.
   Mr. Mulheren, the former chief of Jamie Securities Co., a
defunct securities firm, is charged with 41 counts of
conspiracy, and securities and mail fraud. Mr. Boesky's
cooperation led to the government's sweeping insider-trading
inquiry and to the indictment of Mr. Mulheren.
   Mr. Boesky completed his testimony against Mr. Mulheren
yesterday without seeming to have helped the government's
case much. Mr. Boesky is unlikely to ever take the witness
stand again in a criminal case, since virtually all of the
individuals he has implicated have pleaded guilty to crimes.
Mr. Mulheren is the only individual he has implicated who has
chosen to fight the charges against him at trial.
   However, Mr. Boesky faces civil suits from individuals who
claim they have been damaged by his actions. Mr. Boesky
estimated the damages claimed by those plaintiffs at $1
billion. Those suits are pending.
   Mr. Boesky repeatedly told Mr. Puccio that he couldn't
recall how much he earned in illicit profits without seeing
government documents. Mr. Boesky also said he couldn't
remember whether he had transferred money and other assets to
his family and others in 1986, prior to his guilty plea.
   "Do you recall what your net worth was in 1986?" Mr.
Puccio asked. "I'd have to be refreshed," Mr. Boesky
answered. But Mr. Boesky said he "presumed" his lawyers were
correct when they told the court that he was almost bankrupt
in December 1987, when he was sentenced to three years in
prison.
   Mr. Boesky served 19 months of his prison term in a
federal prison in Lompoc, Calif. "Did you break any laws
while you were at Lompoc?" Mr. Puccio asked. "Yes," Mr.
Boesky answered. "There were a couple of chaps who did
laundry there and I gave them a few quarters to do my
laundry" in violation of prison rules.
   "Isn't it a fact that you paid bribes" to prison officials
and received "special consideration" as a result, Mr. Puccio
asked. "That's an outrageous and malicious accusation, sir,"
Mr. Boesky answered angrily.
   Mr. Boesky also denied a suggestion by Mr. Puccio that Mr.
Boesky received inside information from Stephen Fraidin, then
a close friend of Mr. Boesky's who is a partner at the New
York law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson.
"Did you ever receive insider information from Mr. Fraidin or
his law firm?" Mr. Puccio asked. "Unequivocally no," Mr.
Boesky responded.
   In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Fraidin said, "Any
suggestion that I provided Mr. Boesky with inside information
is outrageous, without basis and totally incorrect."

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices skidded yesterday after it became
apparent that investors were showing only mild interest in
the Treasury's new issue of five-year, two-month notes.
   The $8.5 billion of notes were auctioned by the Treasury
yesterday at an average yield of 8.54%. That was the highest
yield set at a five-year, two-month auction since May 1989
and was even slightly higher than the previous five-year,
two-month note auction Feb. 22 when the average yield was
8.53%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But some traders said the yield may not have been high
enough to attract investors. Bond dealers said the poor
results reflected weaker-than-expected demand by domestic and
foreign buyers, although they weren't sure why investors
shied away. Other dealers said that Japanese investors, who
tend to buy moderate amounts of the notes, were nearly
nonexistent at yesterday's auction.
   "It seems like the psychology in the market just suddenly
turned from positive to negative," said John Costas,
co-manager of government trading at First Boston Corp. He
said that investors expressed interest in buying the notes,
"but when it came time to bid, we didn't see," much interest.
He suspects that some investors may have already "burned a
lot of cash" at Wednesday's two-year note auction and several
weeks ago at the Treasury's huge $30.5 billion refunding of
the government debt.
   In early trading yesterday, bond prices were unchanged to
slightly higher. But when rumors circulated that the auction
was poorly received, prices of Treasury securities moved
lower as dealers reduced prices in an effort to drum up
demand.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 3/8 point
lower, a loss of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount, to yield 8.60%. In when-issued trading activity, the
yield on the new five-year, two-month notes rose to 8.56%.
   In the junk bond market, prices of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. junk
bonds plunged on news that a leading factoring firm tightened
its credit standards toward the retailer.
   Some Macy bonds fell five points, or $50 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount, and yields spurted as high as 25%.
   Henry Kassebaum, a senior vice president at Heller
Financial Corp., confirmed rumors that Heller Financial
shifted from a "revolving credit" policy toward Macy
suppliers to an "order-by-order" policy. Instead of extending
a revolving credit line to Macy suppliers, Heller will now
decide whether to extend credit to suppliers on an
order-by-order basis.
   In response, Macy's 14.5% subordinated debentures,
maturing in 2001, fell more than five points to 57. The
retailer's 14.5% senior subordinated debentures, due in 1998,
also shed five points to end at 67.
   Factoring companies like Heller buy receivables at a
slight discount from suppliers that sell goods to retailers.
A supplier is paid in cash for its receivables and the
factoring agent assumes the risk that the retailer will pay
its bills.
   The problems of Macy's pulled the entire junk bond market
lower, with most issues ending between 1/4 and 1/2 point
lower. Market participants expect bids for the bonds to
weaken further when the market opens today.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   U.S. Treasury notes and bonds traded lower after the
government's $8.5 billion auction of new five-year, two-month
Treasury notes failed to stir enthusiasm in investors.
   The auction results were unexpected, especially coming
after a successful twoyear note auction on Wednesday.
   In trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at
a price of 101 13/32 compared with 101 27/32 on Wednesday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at 101 16/32 to yield 8.63%
compared with 101 27/32 to yield 8.58%.
   Short-term rates were higher. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.68% for a bond
equivalent yield of 7.92% while the rate on six-month bills
fell to 7.71% to yield 8.11%.
   Here are details of yesterday's fiveyear, two-month note
auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

    Accepted noncompetitively .....     $593,000,000

    High price (Rate) .............   99.847 (8.52%)
    Low price (Rate) ..............   99.681 (8.56%)

   The notes are dated June 1 and mature August 15, 1995.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The problems of R.H. Macy's spread to the broader junk
bond market, pushing prices moderately lower.
   Besides Macy's, other big decliners included RJR Nabisco
Inc., whose bonds fell on talk that a major investor was
dumping large amounts of the bonds.
   RJR Nabisco's 14.07% convertible payin-kind debentures,
due in 2009, finished down 1 1/2 points to close at 84 on the
New York Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the
14.07% exchangable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007,
ended 1 3/8 points lower to close at 70 1/4.
   Duracell Holdings' 13.5% subordinated debentures, maturing
in 2000, dropped 1/4 point to end at 103, while Kroger's 12
7/8% senior subordinated debentures, due in 1999, shed 1/2
point to 102 1/4.
   In the investment-grade market, actively traded corporate
issues fell 1/4 to 3/8 point.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities posted small price advances, outpacing
Treasurys and causing yield spreads to tighten slightly.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% bonds for June
delivery firmed 1/32 to 96 for a yield of 9.72%, 1.10
percentage points above the yield on 10-year Treasury notes.
That spread is 0.02 percentage point tighter than late
Wednesday.
   Among other actively traded issues, Ginnie Mae 9.5% bonds
for June delivery were up 1/32 at 98 14/32; Ginnie Mae 10%
bonds were at 100 7/8, up 3/32; Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. 9.5% bonds for June delivery were up 2/32 at 97 31/32
and June Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% bonds
were trading 2/32 higher at 98 15/32.
   Meanwhile, activity remained at a standstill in the market
for high-coupon mortgage securities in the aftermath of the
Public Securities Association statement Tuesday that it will
impose trading curbs on certain high-coupon mortgage issues
that are experiencing rapid prepayment rates.
   The PSA's move is aimed at stemming the recent issuance of
above-market mortgages, used as collateral mainly for GNMA
mortgage-backed securities, that are often prepaid quickly to
refinance more quickly than usual. For investors who have
been paying premiums for those issues, expecting prepayment
to come much later, the value of their purchases has been
sharply reduced.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   In a repeat performance of Wednesday's lifeless trading,
most actively traded municipal bonds finished rock steady
after barely budging all session.
   "It's basically a sideways market in municipals," said
Lewis Nassikas, a trader at First Albany Corp. Trading, he
added, was particularly light with market participants
sluggish before the long Memorial Day weekend.
   There was little response to the revised U.S. gross
national product data for the first quarter.
   GNP was revised downward to a 1.3% annual rate from the
2.1% pace originally estimated last month. Inventory
reduction was the chief reason for the revision.
   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
had forecast, on average, an updated first-quarter clip of
1.8%.
   In secondary activity, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds of 2018 were unchanged at 97 7/8 in late trading,
yielding 7.37%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A stronger yen and speculation that some banks will soon
cut the prime rate triggered a modest rally in the Japanese
government bond market.
   Japan's prime rate, a benchmark long-term loan rate, is
currently 7.9%. The rate is set monthly by three large credit
banks, which are expected to cut the prime rate to 7.6%,
effective June 1. The announcement could come as early as
today.
   Japan's bond market rally was muted, however, because
investors believe the Bank of Japan will continue to put
upward pressure on short-term interest rates, over which the
central bank has the most immediate influence. Economists
said the central bank wants short-term rates to remain high
in order to support the value of the yen, among other things.
   Japan's benchmark 10-year bond rose 0.14 point to 87.71
yesterday to yield 7.02%. (The yield is calculated in local
terms, but would be much lower if calculated by the
semi-annual compound measure that is used in the U.S.)
   Financial markets were closed in West Germany, France,
Switzerland and Holland in observance of Ascension Day.
   In Britain, where trading activity was quiet due to the
holiday in other countries, government bonds ended moderately
lower.

   SEOUL -- After overnight talks, Hyundai Motor Co.'s union
signed a revised new labor contract with the company.
   Union President Lee Sang-bum, who signed the document,
said the union's leadership decided to tell some 27,000 union
members to return to work at Hyundai's Ulsan plant by ending
the strike that began May 15.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plant, 160 miles southeast of Seoul, is South Korea's
largest auto plant. Hyundai Motor is a unit of Hyundai Corp.
   The union president told reporters that the union
leadership decided to effect the new contract without putting
it to a vote of members.
   The union and the management had to renegotiate after a
proposed earlier contract agreed upon through negotiations
was voted down by a majority of union workers in a general
meeting Tuesday. They said the union's demands weren't fully
met.
   The contract contained an average monthly pay increase of
7.6% or a raise of $54.93. In addition, it calls for an
average increase of $20.91 in production and other monthly
allowances, up $5.35 dollars from the amount in the rejected
contract.
   The union had demanded a 19% increase in their monthly
average pay of $621 while the company had offered a 6% raise.

   Commodities:
   Oil Prices Drift Lower Again, but Saudi Signal
   Indicates That a Leveling-Off Could Be Close

   Petroleum prices again drifted lower but may be starting
to level off after the $2-a-barrel plunge of the past two
weeks.
   Helping to calm jittery oil markets yesterday was a signal
from Saudi Arabia, leading producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, that seemed to suggest it may
hold output to quota for a few more weeks, even if others
overproduce.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That didn't stop yesterday's price declines of as much as
31 cents a barrel in U.S. petroleum futures trading. But
there wasn't any further evidence of the panic selling that
had characterized oil markets for the past several days.
   In European markets, spot prices of Middle East and North
Sea crudes actually were marginally higher. But on London's
International Petroleum Exchange futures prices of the North
Sea Brent crude closed lower by three cents to 14 cents a
barrel.
   The bigger drops were in U.S. petroleum futures and
developed late in the trading day. The New York Mercantile
Exchange's July crude contract fell 31 cents a barrel to
settle at $17.83. Traders said this broke through important
technical support points and may signal some further softness
today.
   In other market developments, refiners' field postings for
West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, settled 50
cents a barrel lower at $17 a barrel. According to Dow Jones
International Petroleum Report, Mexico effectively reduced
June contract prices for crude oil exported to U.S. buyers by
20 cents to 30 cents.
   The industry's fundamental factors still appear bearish.
The world is awash in crude oil from high OPEC output. There
is a massive overhang of crude inventories in the U.S. And
even if runaway OPEC production is beginning to slow, on-land
inventories could continue to build in the U.S. and in Europe
as the oil tankers now at sea reach shore and unload their
cargoes.
   As a result, few oil economists are brash enough to argue
that prices may have reached their lows for the year. But
they are beginning to suggest that a turnaround could soon be
in sight.
   Dennis Winters, an oil economist and DRI/McGraw-Hill
senior associate, is among those who believe a price bottom
is nearing, even though the short-term outlook remains weak.
"With the {production} problems in the North Sea, prices
would already be headed higher if storage wasn't chockablock
full," he said.
   Much depends, of course, on OPEC -- and, more
specifically, on Saudi Arabia, its kingpin producer.
   According to the Oil Daily's Energy Compass, which closely
follows OPEC developments, Saudi Arabia has decided to bide
its time for a few weeks more after cutting its own volume.
"Current Saudi thinking is to wait for early indications of
June output volumes" in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
chronic OPEC overproducers, "before taking any decision on
whether or not to reverse its instantly applied 300,000 to
400,000 barrels a day {in} volume cuts," the London-based
publication reported.
   Yesterday, Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister,
emphasized in the strongest terms yet that the kingdom had
committed itself at the May 2 OPEC meeting to abide by its
official quota, and he urged other OPEC members to do the
same. According to the official government statement issued
for Mr. Nazer, the oil minister "made clear that the kingdom
of Saudi Arabia would never market a single barrel outside
its agreed quota of 5.38 million a day."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS &amp; SOYBEANS: Corn and soybean futures prices moved
higher throughout most of the trading session on expectations
of renewed export demand from the Soviet Union. Wire-service
reports quoted Soviet officials as saying the country has
paid off the approximately $250 million it owed U.S. grain
companies, sparking market rumors that such payments are a
prelude to the Soviets' return to the U.S. grain markets.
Over the weekend Soviet newspapers carried criticism of that
country's grain-import officials for squandering scarce hard
currency on poorly timed and inefficient import programs over
the past year, which they said contributed to the country's
recent export-payment problems. Also supporting prices were
worries about a return of wet weather across many Midwestern
growing areas, which may hamper planting. The National
Weather Service's six-to-10-day forecast, released after the
close of trading Wednesday, called for precipitation across
much of the Midwest and normal to below-normal temperatures.
Soybean futures for July delivery gained 6.75 cents a bushel
to close at $6.1550. July corn futures added 4.25 cents a
bushel to close at $2.8050.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures trading turned quiet in the
wake of Wednesday's plunge, with prices recovering slightly.
Silver edged lower while platinum posted a modest gain. June
delivery gold ended $2.30 an ounce higher at $366.90, after
trading in a relatively narrow range. July silver was off
0.30 cent an ounce to $527.50. Platinum rose $2.50 an ounce
to $500.70. There was active demand for gold bullion,
according to one analyst. "The problem was that buyers were
still bargain-hunting, and they couldn't find many sellers at
the low prices, so there wasn't much trading," he said.
Another analyst observed that futures turned quiet because
Wednesday's selling simply lacked follow-through. The
observance of Ascension Thursday, a religious holiday, in
Europe, also contributed to the slower trading pace, he said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices rose because of concern about the
progress of the European beet-sugar crop. The July contract
ended with a gain of 0.45 cent a pound at 14.80 cents, which
was just under the day's high of 14.82 cents. Stephen Platt,
analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago, said dry weather
had prevailed during the past month over Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union's sugar-beet growing areas. "If it persists
into June, it could affect production," he said. According to
another analyst, dry weather was becoming a factor for the
sugar-beet crops in Poland and France. The beets have been
planted and need the proper combination of sun and moisture
to grow properly. Also a possible contributing factor, the
second analyst said, was the continuing uncertainty about how
much sugar Brazil will have available to ship into the world
market from its 1990-91 crop, with a season that begins next
Friday. Brazil has to decide how much of the cane harvest
will be allocated for the production of alcohol for
automotive fuel and how much to earmark for export as sugar,
the analyst said. The problem has been hanging over the world
sugar market for some time, as Brazil is traditionally a
major sugar exporter, and it now appears that the concern is
growing as the harvest nears, the analyst said.

   SAN DIEGO, Calif. -- Gordon Luce, chairman and chief
executive officer of Great American Bank, said he would
retire this year upon reaching age 65.
   "It is a time for change, and perhaps a new perspective
will assist the bank in moving forward in these changing
times," Mr. Luce told the annual meeting. The thrift doesn't
have a mandatory retirement program for executives.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A longtime friend and advisor to Ronald Reagan, Mr. Luce
has been chief executive of the thrift since 1969 and
chairman since 1979. He will remain on the Great American
board.
   During the meeting, Mr. Luce also confirmed reports that
company officials had attempted to lure Federal Home Loan
Bank of San Francisco president James Cirona to succeed him,
but that the parties "could not work out the appropriate
package for his giving up the pretty outstanding position he
already has."
   Great American is the nation's eighth-largest thrift but
has had huge loan problems in Arizona and must raise $350
million in new capital by year end or face a possible federal
takeover.

   Honda Motor Co. said its dealer incentive program is
broader than the company earlier indicated.
   Honda said it started a factory-to-dealer cash incentive
program May 13 that covers its Prelude car, the CRX model and
all Civic hatchbacks, except the base model hatchback. This
program is in addition to one that started April 13, which
covers Civic four-door sedans and station wagons. The first
program was disclosed in The Wall Street Journal yesterday.
Both programs run through June 30.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The newest incentive program gives dealers meeting sales
goals $500 for each Prelude, CRX or Civic hatchback they sell
through June 30. Dealers can use these cash incentives to
lower the price to buyers, so it's helpful for consumers to
be aware of the programs. Typically, auto makers don't
publicly announce dealer incentives; they do advertise
direct-to-consumer incentives.
   From January through April, Honda had sold 10,874
Preludes, down 29% from the same period last year.

   NEW YORK -- Ogden Corp.'s board named Richard Ablon, who
heads the company's largest business unit, as its new
president and chief executive officer.
   As chief executive, Mr. Ablon, 40 years old, succeeds his
father Ralph Ablon, 73 years old, who remains chairman of the
facilities-management company. The post of president had been
vacant.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Richard Ablon will continue as president of Ogden Allied
Services Corp., which generates more than $1 billion a year
in revenue from abatement and decontamination services,
management of buildings and industrial facilities,
airline-industry services, and promotion of sports and
entertainment events.
   The younger Mr. Ablon said company operations will
continue as in the past. "In terms of day-to-day reality, it
isn't much different from before." However, he said Ogden is
unlikely to follow through on a possible spinoff of Ogden
Allied, which his father had mentioned to analysts in a
November meeting.
   The younger Mr. Ablon also predicted Ogden will post
record revenue and earnings in 1990. The previous highs for
both measures were set in 1989, when revenue totaled $1.37
billion and earnings hit $67 million, or $1.68 a share.
   Ogden's other major business, Ogden Projects Inc., builds
and manages solid-waste-to-energy plants and conducts
hazardous-waste disposal operations. It had $329 million in
revenue last year. Ogden Corp. holds about an 85% interest in
Ogden Projects, which is a public company.
   Richard Ablon joined the company after graduation from
college in 1971. He previously managed Ogden's entertainment
and aviation businesses.

   NEW YORK -- The final episode of "Twin Peaks," a
television drama, left a passel of unsolved mysteries but
lured 22% of the audience -- the highest share since its
debut six weeks ago.
   "Twin Peaks" was the top-rated program in the 10-to-11
p.m. time period. It was seen by 12.6% of all U.S. homes and
by 22% of all TV sets in use at that hour, according to A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The final episode fared well among viewers under 50 years
old, whom advertisers want to reach. It drew 34% of women
ages 18 to 34, who were watching television Wednesday night;
26% of women ages 35 to 49; and 28% and 22% of men in those
respective age groups. The series has ranked 49th in terms of
how many homes tune in -- but it ranks No. 28 among women
ages 18 to 49.
   "Twin Peaks" joins the ABC lineup as a full series next
fall. Fans will have to wait until then to resolve myriad
mysteries the series raised.
   "Twin Peaks" earned the highest ratings of any ABC show in
its time slot in five years, said Alan Wurtzel, senior vice
president at the Capital Cities/ABC Inc. network.

   Some Boeing 737s Lack
   Pin for Steering Controls

   SEATTLE -- Boeing Co. said that airline inspections of its
737-model jetliners have turned up seven planes missing the
cotter pin that secures a bolt in the planes' steering
controls.
   The pins are being installed by Boeing field-service
personnel. "It's a quick adjustment that just takes a second
or two," a spokesman for the aircraft maker said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The inspections were conducted after a missing pin caused
a control wheel to come off in the hands of the co-pilot of a
West German airliner in flight last week. Boeing later
discovered a missing pin on a second 737 at its Renton,
Wash., production plant.
   Apart from the plane being readied for delivery, the
defective planes are all owned by overseas airlines. Boeing
said the West German report is the only one it has received
of an in-flight incident. The pilot landed the plane safely
using the second set of controls.
   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. airlines
to inspect pilot controls on three models of Boeing 737
jetliners after Boeing reported the cotter-pin problem last
week. Yesterday, an agency spokesman said that so far it
doesn't appear that any domestic carriers are affected. The
agency said it expected a final report "in a matter of
weeks."

Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute, a

   Assets of 242 general-purpose funds fell $750.1 million,

   Mutual-fund assets were revised for the previous week
ended May 16 to $381.32 billion. The reported decrease of
$1.78 billion was revised to a drop of $2.18 billion.
   "After a string of weekly declines caused by a variety of
transitory factors, assets of money-market funds rose
slightly in the last reporting week," said Dr. Jacob Dreyer,
vice president and chief economist at the institute. "The
modest rebound in their assets occurred despite rising stock
and bond prices, which are usually associated with money
being switched out of short-term and into long-term funds."

billion yen in the prior fiscal year.
   Honda officials said growing marketing costs and higher
nonoperating costs, including foreign exchange losses and
interest payments, hurt earnings.
   Robust demand in North America as well as in Japan, now
enjoying its second longest postwar economic expansion,
combined with the yen's decline during the year raise sales,

   Former Pru-Bache
   Broker Indicted
   In Money Scheme

   NEW YORK -- Gary Zahn, a former top-ranking broker at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., was indicted by a federal
grand jury in Brooklyn on 13 counts related to laundering
more than $400,000 for clients.
   Mr. Zahn had been known as a "million-dollar" broker at
Prudential-Bache, though it was unclear whether he had
generated more than $1 million of commissions over any given
year. He was a senior vice president of investments and a
member of the chairman's council, reflecting his status as
one of the firm's 90 top-grossing representatives.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for Prudential-Bache, a unit of Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, said, "We terminated" Mr. Zahn "as
a result of this matter" in March. "We have cooperated with
and continue to cooperate with the U.S. attorney's office on
this matter."
   The indictment charges that from February 1982 until about
March 1988, Mr. Zahn and others, who aren't named, helped
clients evade the federal law requiring that cash
transactions exceeding $10,000 be reported to the Internal
Revenue Service. Each count in the indictment, which was
issued in U.S. District Court, carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Franklyn H. Snitow, attorney for Mr. Zahn at Snitow &amp;
Pauley in Manhattan, declined to comment on whether his
client would fight the charges. The attorney did say,
however, that Mr. Zahn "faithfully and properly served both
Pru-Bache and his clients."
   The law, which is designed to help the government in
criminal, tax, and regulatory inquiries, requires disclosure
of the identity of the person who conducted the transaction
or the organization or person for whom the transaction was
completed.
   Mr. Zahn is charged with having received cash from clients
and then processing the funds in bank checks of less than
$10,000. Prudential-Bache then didn't file the required
reports on the transactions, the indictment alleges.
   In October 1987, PaineWebber Group Inc.'s top stockbroker,
Gary Eder, was sentenced to six months in prison and given a
$510,000 fine in a money-laundering case. Mr. Eder admitted
helping various customers of the firm hide at least $700,000
from the IRS by avoiding the filing of required
currency-transaction reports.

   Stocks Decline on Profit-Taking
   After Disappointing GNP Data

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed lower in moderate trading,
as early profit-taking in the wake of a disappointing
economic report proved to be too much for the market to
overcome.
   Tobacco stocks were especially weak, as investors reacted
negatively to the prospect of new restrictions on cigarette
sales in the U.S. Energy and metals issues also ranked among
the day's poorest performers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Largely because of the declines in those sectors, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average just barely missed extending its
string of all-time highs to four sessions. The average went
down 0.71 point to 2855.55.
   About 155.1 million shares were traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, compared with 172.3 million Wednesday, as
activity started to wind down in advance of the Memorial Day
weekend. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the holiday
observance.
   Stocks dipped to session lows at midmorning, after the
government released revised figures on first-quarter gross
national product, which were weaker than expected. The data
showed that the economy expanded at a 1.3% annual rate in the
quarter, well below the government's earlier estimate of a
2.1% rate.
   Also, some futures-related program selling put further
pressure on stocks in the last hour of trading. The sell
programs went into effect after stock-index futures dropped
to relatively small premiums to the cash indices, permitting
traders to lock in profits by purchasing the futures and
selling baskets of stocks.
   But traders said a continued willingness among
institutional investors to lend buying support to the market
during periods of price weakness acted to cushion its fall.
"They're staying with solid names, especially the blue
chips," said Richard J. Ciardullo, director of institutional
trading at Raymond, James &amp; Associates, St. Petersburg, Fla.
   This emphasis left broader market measures lagging the Dow
industrials. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index posted the
equivalent of a six-point drop in the 30-stock average by
losing 0.88 to 358.41, while the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 0.38 to 195.47, and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index slid 0.44 to 333.84.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the Big Board by
a margin of 791 to 725, with 519 unchanged.
   Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., noted that investors "appear to be
focusing on a narrower and narrower group of growth stocks"
to carry the advance, especially technology issues. "What the
market seems to be saying is that it's not discounting a new
economic cycle or even a recovery in corporate earnings," he
said, pointing to a retreat in the Dow Jones Transportation
Average as a possible warning sign of trouble ahead for the
economy. The average dropped 7.11 to 1159.50.
   Philip Morris dropped 1 to 44 1/8 and topped the list of
most active Big Board issues, as 3.7 million shares changed
hands in composite trading. As part of an anti-smoking drive
aimed at children, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan proposed model state legislation that would ban
cigarette vending machines and institute a licensing system
similar to that used to control alcoholic-beverage sales.
   Among other tobacco stocks, American Brands retreated 1
3/8 to 67 5/8, and UST lost 1 to 29. Loews, the parent
company of Lorillard, fell 1/4 to 116 7/8.
   Oil issues came under pressure, as oil prices fell again
in the wake of a steep drop Wednesday, with July crude-oil
futures falling below $18 a barrel in New York trading. Among
the energy stocks in the Dow industrials, Exxon dropped 1/4
to 47 1/8, Chevron dropped 1 1/8 to 68 1/4 and Texaco fell
3/4 to 58 5/8.
   Lower oil prices also sparked a sell-off among oil-field
services stocks. Baker Hughes fell 1 1/8 to 27 3/4,
Halliburton declined 1 to 47 3/4, Schlumberger lost 3/4 to 56
1/4, Parker Drilling eased 1/4 to 9 5/8 and Rowan slid 1/2 to
13 1/2.
   Aluminum Co. of America dropped 1 3/8 to 65 1/8,
contributing to the setback in the Dow industrials, as
selling hit the metals sector. Amax fell 1/2 to 24 3/4,
Phelps Dodge tumbled 1 1/2 to 59 3/4 and Asarco lost 1/2 to
26 5/8.
   But another of the average's 30 issues, McDonald's, gained
1 to 35 1/8, on 1.9 million shares, after two Chemical
Banking subsidiaries unveiled plans to package loans to the
company's franchisees into securities. The loans are to be
made by Golden Managers Acceptance Corp., a new company to be
known as Golden Mac.
   Compaq Computer, which declared a 2-for-1 stock split,
fell 7/8 to 122, as the technology sector faltered in the
wake of its recent surge. International Business Machines
closed unchanged at 118 3/4, Digital Equipment went down 1
1/8 to 92 1/8 and Texas Instruments slid 1/8 to 43 1/4.
   But Motorola surged 3 3/4 to 83 3/4 and peaked at 84,
marking the second consecutive session in which the stock set
a 52-week high. Japanese telecommunications officials
selected the company's speech-coding technology as the
standard for the cellular-telephone industry in that country.
Motorola also received an initial order for $35 million of
cellular equipment from a Japanese company for installation
within the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor.
   L.A. Gear, which gained 1 5/8 to 50 1/8, also set a
52-week high by rallying to 50 3/8 during the session.
Salomon Brothers, which reiterated a favorable
recommendation, said it believes the stock will continue to
outpace the overall market.
   U.S. Shoe rose 1 to 24 1/2, after reporting that net
income for its first quarter ended May 5 more than tripled
from a year earlier to $17.4 million.
   Paramount Communications gained 1 to 47 1/2. In its "Heard
on the Street" column, The Wall Street Journal reported that
Mario Gabelli, a portfolio manager, counts the stock among
his favorites. BHC Communications, another issue on his list,
rose 1 1/8 to 49 7/8 in American Stock Exchange trading.
   First Financial Management rose 1 7/8 to 25 1/8. Merrill
Lynch reiterated a favorable recommendation on the stock
after the company met with analysts Wednesday.
   Fuqua Industries climbed 1 7/8 to 23. PaineWebber upgraded
its investment rating on the stock to "attractive" from
"neutral," citing the possibility that earnings could be
better than expected because of the company's stock buy-backs
and acquisitions.
   CMS Energy went up 1/2 to 29 1/8. A Michigan appeals court
threw out a preliminary injunction against the company in its
dispute with state regulators about the use of proceeds from
the proposed sale and leaseback of CMS's Midland, Mich.,
power plant.
   The Amex Market Value Index rose 1.11 to 360.76. American
Stock Exchange volume totaled 23.3 million shares, compared
with 16.6 million a day earlier. There were 285 issues
advancing and 275 declining, and 269 were unchanged.

   The House's Clean-Air Bill:
   Firms, Environmentalists
   Gear Up for Crucial Round

   WASHINGTON -- The battle over clean-air legislation is
entering the final round as industry and environmentalists
gear up for the crucial House-Senate conference.
   The House on Wednesday approved its version of the
legislation, which would impose the nation's first controls
on acid rain, curb cancer-causing emissions from factories,
and take a new approach to cleaning up smog in all U.S.
cities by 2010. The Senate passed its version last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When fully in effect, the legislation is expected to
impose about $21.5 billion in annual costs on industry.
"Everybody is going to find out clean air is not free," said
Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the House Energy and Commerce
Committee chairman, who predicted that the conference could
be long and difficult.
   Turning up the political heat on the conference, which is
expected to get under way soon after the Memorial Day recess,
is the threat of a White House veto if the measure contains a
House-approved unemployment-assistance package designed to
help workers who lose their jobs because of the legislation.
   The White House contends the five-year, $250 million
measure would create "a potentially open-ended liability"
because there wouldn't be any way to determine whether
workers lost their jobs because of the clean-air act or
another reason. Bush administration officials yesterday were
confident they could kill the provision or dilute it during
conference.
   The provision passed the House by a 271-146 margin,
however. And in the Senate, a worker-aid package almost
prevailed, despite opposition from Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell of Maine. Yesterday, an aide to the senator
said he hasn't yet taken a position on the House provision.
   Even before the conference, the bills agree on billions of
dollars of controls. Both would force utilities to cut
sulfur-dioxide emissions by 10 million tons a year by
establishing an innovative pollution-trading system proposed
by President Bush. Under the system, utilities that made
extra-deep cuts would get pollution credits they could sell
or swap with other utilities.
   The measures would adopt a new system of regulating toxic
emissions that would force plants to install the best
available technology to reduce cancer risks to nearby
residents. Each bill would make auto companies clean up auto
exhaust and require the oil industry to make cleaner-burning
gasoline in an effort to reduce smog. "The differences
between the House and Senate bills are not legion," said Rep.
Billy Tauzin (D., La.).
   Among key issues to be settled in conference are:
   -- Whether to force the auto industry to start making cars
that run on alternatives to gasoline such as methanol and
natural gas. The House bill would launch such a pilot program
in California.
   -- How to determine whether to impose a second round of
cuts in auto-tailpipe emissions. Under the House bill, these
cuts, which the Environmental Protection Agency estimates
would add $500 to the price of a car, would go into effect
only if an EPA study determined they are needed and
cost-effective. The Senate would make the controls dependent
on the nation's air quality.
   -- How to force factories to reduce the cancer risk to
nearby residents after the best available pollution
technology has been installed. Industry and environmentalists
generally prefer the House approach.
   -- How hard to crack down on industrial sources of
smog-producing chemicals. The House would give a stronger
role to the federal government in forcing states and cities
to clean up smog.
   Although they are contained in both bills, the
reformulated gasoline provisions will be at issue as well, if
the oil industry has its way. To the dismay of the industry,
the measures spell out a recipe for gasoline to be sold in
the nation's nine smoggiest areas that would require the use
of oxygenated additives such as ethanol.
   House lawmakers generally contend they are heading into
conference from a strong position. After nine years of being
unable to even bring a clean-air bill to the floor, the House
completed voting on its measure in a single day. The speed
reflected the effort by Mr. Dingell, a friend to industry,
and Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), a strong
environmentalist, to lock up agreements on almost all
contentious issues before they got to the floor. On several
major issues -- including auto-tailpipe emissions and
controls on industrial smog -- the lawmakers are committed to
the accords through conference.
   By contrast, the Senate debate took longer, and leaders
were governed during floor debate by an agreement worked out
with the White House. Mr. Mitchell, who said he would have
preferred stronger provisions on several issues, has
emphasized he is no longer bound by the agreement.
   Both industry groups and environmentalists alike expressed
optimism yesterday that the conference committee would
produce a better bill than either the House or the Senate
version. William Fay, head of an industrywide lobbying group,
said, "I see some real opportunities to make these bills
better. Mr. Dingell can be fairly formidable in a conference
committee."
   Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club said, "By
taking the best from each, we can have a clean-air
masterpiece."

   Japan's Nonlife Insurers
   Had Lower Net for Year

   TOKYO -- Large growth in redemptions and claims as well as
financial instability drove down profits at Japan's nonlife
insurers in fiscal 1989.
   Interest-rate deregulation in Japan has led policy holders
in recent years to redeem annuities in favor of
higher-yielding bank deposits, resulting in lower investment
income and diminished assets as well as large payments. In
the fiscal year ended March 31, growth in investment income
was also depressed by instability in the Japanese financial
markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To counter redemptions of annuities, the companies have
relied on growth in policies such as auto insurance for
business. An unusually high number of road accidents in the
year left all the companies exposed to large claims from
shareholders. Profits on insurance operations at the four
largest Japanese nonlife insurers fell sharply in the year.

   Par Pharmaceutical Inc. said its president was granted
proxies from four shareholders to vote about two million of
its shares in matters relating to board membership.
   The proxies, when combined with the shares owned by the
president, Kenneth I. Sawyer, give him beneficial ownership
of 17.8% of the Spring Valley, N.Y., generic drug company. In
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Sawyer said
he was granted the proxies to "help assure" certain
governmental agencies involved in investigating and reviewing
the generic drug industry and the company that the
shareholders support new management installed in September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proxies give Mr. Sawyer the right to vote the about
two million shares in matters relating to election or removal
of directors and filling board vacancies.
   Par has been the target of federal investigations for the
past two years. Earlier this year Par and its majority-owned
Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc. unit were fined a total of $400,000
for illegal gratuity payments made to an official of the Food
and Drug Administration. Par and Quad both have recalled
products amid concerns about adherence to regulatory
procedures.

   Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., said it agreed to
pay $5.7 million to settle two shareholder lawsuits arising
out of a plunge in its stock last year.
   The class-action suits were filed on behalf of purchasers
of Apple stock between Jan. 17 and Jan. 27, 1989. During that
time, Apple sharply reduced its earnings outlook for the
fiscal-second quarter, ended March 31; the revision sent the
stock reeling. The suits alleged violations of state and
federal securities disclosure laws.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Apple said a portion of the settlement, which is still
subject to approval of the federal court for the Northern
District of California where the suits were filed, will be
paid by an insurance company. The company said it continues
to deny any wrongdoing, and agreed to the settlement to avoid
the expense of further litigation.

   Micron Technology Inc., Boise, Idaho, beset by lackluster
demand for computer chips in recent quarters, apparently has
lost the interest of a major shareholder.
   The chip maker said it plans to register next month 3.6
million, or nearly 10%, of its common shares, for sale by
Amstrad PLC. Amstrad, a major British electronics concern,
acquired the stake in October 1988 for $75 million, or $21 a
share.

   The original transaction had been considered part of a
strategy by Micron to ensure long-term demand for its chips
as well as an attempt by Amstrad to secure stable supplies of
Micron's then-scarce dynamic random access memory chips.
   Lately, Micron has been beset by a chip glut. For the
fiscal-second quarter ended March 1, it reported net income
of $14,000, or less than a penny a share, on revenue of $77.5
million, compared with profit of $29.2 million, or 77 cents a
share, on revenue of $113.8 million a year earlier.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Micron closed at
$14, down 62.5 cents.

   Immunex Corp. scientists took a step toward creating a
potential new treatment for cachexia, septic shock and
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, the
Seattle company said.
   The scientists, in an article to be published today in the
journal Science, said they cloned the human gene responsible
for producing a receptor for human tumornecrosis factor, a
particularly toxic immune-system hormone that is overproduced
in certain disorders. Cloning the gene will enable scientists
to produce synthetic copies of the receptor to help shut off
overactive immune responses.

   Cachexia is a condition that affects cancer and trauma
patients, rendering the body incapable of processing
nutrients, while septic shock results from severe bacterial
infections commonly picked up in hospitals.

Cytokines are immune-system hormones that regulate white

   NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
civil suit against Bombay Palace Restaurants Inc.; Sant
Chatwal, the company's chairman; and Kewal Chopra, its former
vice president and chief financial officer.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleged
securities-law violations in connection with Bombay's
takeover of Lifestyle Restaurants Inc. in 1987. The company
operates Bombay Palace and Beefsteak Charlie's restaurants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time as the suit was filed, the defendants
agreed to a permanent injunction barring them from future
violations of the securities law. The defendants neither
admitted nor denied the allegations in agreeing to the
injunction, which settles the suit. The SEC didn't seek any
penalty other than the injunction.
   Bombay also agreed to engage independent auditors to
review its recordkeeping and agreed to adopt policies and
procedures to ensure that its recordkeeping complies with
securities law.
   In September, Bombay filed for Chapter 11 status under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 11 protects a company from
creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debt.
   On behalf of the defendants, Mr. Chopra, who remains an
employee of the company, said: "We have settled with the SEC
in an effort to put behind us events that occurred several
years ago. By settling with the SEC, we hope to be able to
devote full attention to the future of the Bombay Palace
companies and to strive for their successful emergence from
bankruptcy reorganization proceedings."
   The SEC's lawsuit alleged that in acquiring Lifestyle, the
defendants falsely represented that they wouldn't use
Lifestyle to generate cash for Bombay, except in certain
specified circumstances. The SEC's suit said the defendants
failed to disclose that $2 million was taken from Lifestyle
and turned over to Bombay, and that they overstated Bombay's
financial results.
   Bombay announced in April 1989 that the SEC was
investigating it. Jeffrey Zuckerman, an SEC associate
regional administrator in New York, said Bombay's
bankruptcy-law filing delayed the agency's civil action.

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Banking Committee passed a
measure aimed at giving U.S. regulators leverage to open
Japan's financial markets to greater participation by U.S.
banks and securities firms.
   The bill, passed by a voice vote, would give U.S.
financial regulators the power to impose sanctions against
foreign financial companies whose home countries don't open
their markets to U.S. companies. Regulators would be able to
deny applications from foreign financial concerns to start or
expand their U.S. operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The committee passed the bill after accepting an amendment
by Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) that would effectively
prevent the measure from affecting financial firms from the
European Community. The amendment was a signal the committee
is mostly concerned about the growing power of Japanese banks
in the U.S., while U.S. banks are frustrated with the
restrictions they face in Japan.
   The bill, co-sponsored by committee Chairman Donald Riegle
(D., Mich.) and its ranking Republican, Utah Sen. Jake Garn,
is opposed by the Bush administration, which argues it can
gain more access for U.S. companies through the current trade
negotiations.

   Kinark Corp. said its directors rejected an unsolicited

   Kinark, a Tulsa, Okla., owner of galvanizing plants and

the company is best served by continuing to pursue its

several conditions, which made the possibility of completing

   However, Kinark said it will consider a new proposal from
Steel Partners, a New York investment partnership, after
Kinark completes the planned sale of its Camelot Hotels for
$12 million, if the offer has fewer uncertainties that the
most recent proposal. Steel Partners has indicated than it
owns about 4.4% of Kinark.
   Kinark also said it expects to disclose election results

Those candidates were nominated in opposition to Kinark's

   BUSH RENEWED China's trade benefits despite objections
over its rights policy.
   Brushing aside critics who favored a hard line a year
after Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, the
president extended China's most-favored-nation trade status.
The preferences give China the lowest possible tariffs. But
the president, speaking at a news conference in Washington,
said it would be premature to grant similar benefits to the
Soviet Union because of concerns over the Kremlin's actions
toward the Baltic republic of Lithuania.

   THE NAVY REOPENED its inquiry into the explosion aboard
the battleship Iowa.
   Citing an "unexplained ignition" of bags of gunpowder
during testing, Navy Secretary Garrett called for the renewed
investigation into the April 1989 blast, in which 47 sailors
were killed. The Navy also ordered a halt to the firing of
16-inch guns on all World War II-vintage battleships. A naval
report released last September had concluded that the
gun-turret incident on the USS Iowa was "most probably" an
intentional act by a crew member.
   Congressional panels, in an assessment of the Navy's
inquiry into the Iowa blast, faulted both the investigation
and the conclusion's "excess of certitude."

   Gorbachev offered to lift economic curbs against Lithuania
if the republic suspends its independence declaration, and
said the Baltic state could secede from the Soviet Union in
two years if it follows Kremlin procedure. But the Soviet
leader, who met with Vilnius officials, threatened to impose
presidential rule to block the secession bid.
                                                                                                       

   Premier Ryzhkov warned the Soviet public of the "painful

wasn't any choice but to abandon central planning and adopt a
market system. Under the government plan, the transition
would double food prices, and consumers in Moscow and
Leningrad reportedly began panic buying.

   The House approved a $4 billion spending bill for fiscal

   THE ECONOMY GREW at a 1.3% rate in the first quarter, far
slower than the 2.1% reported earlier. But the change
reflected a downward revision in business inventories,
particularly autos, which many analysts said was a healthy
sign in a flat economy. Real final sales, a gauge of economic
demand, grew a revised 4.1%, up from 4% estimated previously.

   Budget negotiators disagreed on how ambitious a goal to
set for reducing the deficit over five years. Democrats
proposed aiming for a package of spending cuts and tax

   Taiwan shares resumed their plunge Thursday, as a lack of
confidence persisted.
   In Tokyo, stock prices strengthened on moderate volume, as
arbitrage buying and a surge in large-capitalization domestic
issues sparked a round of buying in the late afternoon. In
London, equities finished a lackluster session lower, as
futures selling and a widespread lack of interest led the
market down.

   Taiwan's weighted index, which rebounded 294.08 points
Wednesday, plunged 426.63, or 6.08%, closing at 6587.77, a
15-month low. The index has tumbled nearly 2,000 points, or
23%, since May 16.
   All eight sectors registered major losses, falling between
4.86% and 6.48%. Volume, including stocks and mutual funds,
totaled about 969.8 million shares valued at 61.08 billion
New Taiwan dollars (US$2.23 billion), compared with 1.19
billion shares valued at NT$76.45 billion a day earlier.
Among 193 losers, 156 stocks dropped to their 7% limit; only
three stocks gained, and two were unchanged.
   The market opened lower, as investors took quick profits
on Wednesday's gains. The declines then widened, as sellers
poured onto the trading floor.
   "Weak confidence destroys the game," Elvis Yang, a broker
with Tycoon Securities Co., said. "We see little hope for the
market to reverse its downward trend over the short term at
least." He sees a recovery only if the government takes
actions, such as to reduce the 0.6% stock transaction tax and
to instruct banks to support the market. "Investors were so
bearish, they need someone to lead them," he said. "The
government is the best choice."
   Dealers blamed continued drops mainly on concerns about
political uncertainty and capital outflow.
   "A calm-down is all investors need right now," said Miao
Tai Sheng, assistant manager of Taiwan International
Securities Corp. He said the market shouldn't be far away
from its bottom, as long as no panic selling surfaces. "The
market is oversold," he said. "It's time to buy low-priced
blue chips."
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues, which
added 238.21 points Wednesday, was up 135.24 at 32311.75.
First section volume was estimated at 600 million shares, off
from 640 million shares a day earlier.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first
section issues, which gained 4.36 points Wednesday, added
0.95 to 2395.90 Thursday.
   Friday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index advanced 286.67 points
to close the morning session at 32598.42.
   Traders said Thursday that the biggest news affecting the
market was Japan Airlines' order for 20 Boeing Co. 747-400s,
with options for an additional 34. A trader said
heavy-industrial machinery makers and other manufacturers
that could supply parts for the project got investors'
attention.
   Interest in the domestic manufacturers boosted prices in
other large-capitalization shares, sparking a rally in steel
issues and trading companies, traders said. Moreover,
arbitragers in the late afternoon worked to keep the futures
index at high levels, to sell profitably and then buy through
program trading on the cash index. Consequently, higher cash
prices, coupled with the surge in less expensive, domestic
issues, pushed the Nikkei index into a firmer position within
the 32000 level.
   In expectation of strong results from Sony, buying
interest was heavy in the company's shares, as well as in
those of other blue-chip electricals. Sony rose 50 yen to
8,750 yen ($57.76). After trading closed, Sony posted a 37%
rise in consolidated pretax profit to 227.43 billion yen
($1.5 billion) for its year ended March 31, exceeding
expectations. Other high-technology companies posted similar,
favorable results, a trader said.
   Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained 60 to 1,060, mostly on
speculation that the company will be linked to the JAL-Boeing
project, but also that shipbuilding companies' earnings will
be favorable. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries received
aerospace attention, rising 70 to 1,210, but a trader said
the rise also was linked to rumors the company may take over
Sasebo Heavy Industries, which is said to be having financial
problems.
   In London, market watchers said much of the confidence in
equities built up over the past several weeks was knocked out
by Wednesday's worse-than-expected trade data for April. "No
matter how you look at the figures, they aren't good news," a
market maker said. "It has rocked U.K. investors back on
their heels."
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
finished down 10.3 points at 2277.1, off its early-afternoon
high of 2295.4 and well above its midmorning minimum of
2269.3. Turnover amounted to a reasonable 420.3 million
shares, compared with 542.1 million a day earlier. The FT
30-share index ended off 4.8 points at 1805.2.
   Traders said the market lacked direction amid an absence
of striking corporate or economic news. They also said there
weren't any European buyers because of the religious holiday,
which closed most financial centers Thursday in Europe.
   British Telecom reported a 5.5% decline in full-year
pretax profit and a #390 million ($660.5 million)
restructuring charge. The figures were in line with
expectations, a dealer said, and analysts were optimistic for
the company in the coming year. The stock rose 2 pence to 276
pence.
   MEPC, a property company, posted a 20% rise in interim
pretax profit but its shares were hit as a reaction to the
warning that investment values were likely to be in decline
through the year. The company's shares skidded 20 to 489.
   One of the day's biggest gainers was Thorn EMI, which
added 21 to 733. The entertainment and technology company
said it is holding talks that could lead to the disposal of
its lighting subsidiary to GTE Corp., a U.S.
telecommunications, lighting and precision materials company.
   Oil issues were weaker across the board on a sagging crude
price, dealers said.
   British Petroleum fell 7 to 316, Shell Transport &amp; Trading
lost 7 to 457, Lasmo dropped 8 to 385, Enterprise slipped 6
to 611, and Ultramar lost 2 to 339.
   Equity prices closed higher in Milan. The Ascension Day
observance closed markets in France, West Germany, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, South Africa and
elsewhere.
   Share prices rose in Hong Kong, fell in Sydney, Singapore
and Manila, and were little changed in Wellington and Seoul.
Hong Kong stocks extended their rally to a fifth consecutive
session in active trading.

   House Approves $4 Billion Spending Bill
   That Cuts Military Funds by $2 Billion

   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $4 billion fiscal-1990
spending bill that would cut more than $2 billion from
military accounts to help finance increased domestic
appropriations and President Bush's long-sought aid package
for Panama and Nicaragua.
   Provisions to expedite distribution of the $720 million
for the fledgling Central American governments were upheld
277-126, and the underlying measure was adopted by a 308-108
margin despite conservative objections to a litany of
parochial projects added by influential lawmakers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bill was sent to the Senate, which struggled last
night to overcome the final snarls delaying passage. But a
fragile marriage of convenience appeared to survive between
the Bush administration and the Democratic leadership eager
to complete action before the Memorial Day recess.
   With the Pentagon's backing, the House easily stripped out
$238 million for a costly ammunition plant in Louisiana, but
among domestic projects, the White House appeared to turn a
deaf ear to repeated GOP assaults on Congress's
appropriators. "We want the supplemental to go through," an
administration official last night, "and we want it to go
through today."
   The result was a lopsided series of votes upholding a
laundry list of provisions ranging from a $6 million Iowa
wildlife refuge to a directive that the Department of Housing
and Urban Development fund an assortment of previously
appropriated community projects costing over $28 million.
   The most closely fought battle came on the internal
question of how the House would finance lawmakers' own
election-year mail. The bill had proposed to permit the
transfer of as much as $25 million in unobligated
appropriations to meet an expected shortfall for the
free-mail, or "franking," privilege. But after sharp debate,
Republicans scored an upset over the Democratic leadership on
a 208-161 roll call that allowed them to strip the provision.
   About one-quarter of the Central American aid is to pay
off back debts to international financial institutions. In
Nicaragua -- the more desperate of the two countries -- a
focus is retooling private enterprises. Of the $300 million
slated for the new Chamorro regime, $128 million is to
finance imports including oil and agriculture-related
products, while medical and education funds total less than
$30 million.
   Among domestic accounts, more than $1.7 billion is
provided to meet increased costs for food stamps and veterans
programs. Southern and Western states hit by recent flooding
would share in an estimated $216 million in new disaster
assistance. Child-education and vaccine programs would
receive increases, along with the Census, and as the bill has
grown steadily, so have the consequent cuts from the
Pentagon.
   Final bargaining failed to resolve the question of how to
pay for another $1.45 billion shortfall in the military's own
personnel and hospital costs. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
balked at proposed adjustments taking $230 million from major
weapons programs such as the B-2 bomber and the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   The list of new transfers had been proposed by House Armed
Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.), but the
Pentagon apparently was reluctant to make any further
concessions on strategic programs before next week's summit
talks with the Soviets. A new deadline for resolving the
personnel problem was set for mid-June, but as the date is
pushed backward, the potential disruptions only grow, making
the Senate Armed Services Committee reluctant to release the
overall appropriations bill without first addressing the
problem.
   In the atmosphere of cutbacks, the Pentagon portion of the
supplemental-spending bill for the fiscal 1990, which ends
Sept. 30, became a battleground for lawmakers. The fight over
the Louisiana ammunition plant pitted Sen. Bennett Johnston
(D., La.) against the ranking Republican on the House Rules
Committee, Rep. James Quillen, whose Tennessee district is
the home of a competing facility.
   Report language inserted in House-Senate negotiations
lifts prior restrictions on the expenditure of $20 million by
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for
high-definition television. Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh,
and Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., currently hold
contracts with the agency, and two senior appropriators from
those states, Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.) and Sen. Mark
Hatfield (R., Ore.), were described as influential in winning
release of the funds.
   For policy reasons -- and the support of Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) --
a written report accompanying the final bill seeks to block
the Army from terminating work on 105mm tank ammunition being
developed by Hercules Inc.

   TOKYO -- Crude-oil imports to Japan rose 26.7% on a yearly
basis in April to 119.1 million barrels, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
   The increase reflects increased domestic refining and
Japanese refiners' apparent effort to buy above-average
quantities of oil early in the year. The refiners had
expected oil prices to rise during this year, but prices have
fallen. Refiners have found themselves largely unable to take
advantage of the lower prices, because of a lack of storage
space.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The kinds of oil Japan imported in April show the
country's move into a lighter -- and more expensive -- crude
refining slate. Mideast nations supplied 71.6% of Japan's
needs, or 85.2 million barrels.
   Domestic petroleum products sales rose 3.3% from April
1989. Sales of fuel oil, jet fuel, and naphtha all fell from
year-earlier levels. Sales of kerosene, vehicle fuels, and
gasoil were all higher. Products exports were sharply higher,
as a result of liberalized government refining policies.

   Manufacturers Hanover's Hegarty Takes
   Hard Line as Head of Real Estate Group

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Michael Hegarty is one of the executives often
referred to within Manufacturers Hanover Corp. as its "West
Side bankers."
   The nickname, referring to the tough street kids in "West
Side Story," is meant as a compliment by some insiders who
feel that Manufacturers Hanover needs to be more hard-nosed
to prosper in today's difficult environment for banks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturers Hanover named the 45-year-old Mr. Hegarty
its group executive for real estate finance and consumer
banking. A native New Yorker, graduate of Iona College and
winner of the Bronze Star while leading a rifle platoon in
Vietnam, Mr. Hegarty captured the attention of Manufacturers'
top management for the dramatic turnaround of its real estate
portfolio.
   Since Mr. Hegarty took charge of real estate in 1987,
Manufacturers' portfolio of problem real estate loans dropped
to $95 million last year from $322 million in 1986. As a
result, its portfolio is in good shape compared with most
other banks that are awash in bad commercial real estate
loans.
   That's a welcome reversal for the nation's ninth-largest
banking company, long accustomed to being a leader among big
banks in problem loans in such diverse areas as energy
lending and loans to developing countries.
   And Mr. Hegarty has turned the real estate portfolio
around without simply turning off the spigot for new loans.
He has cut back sharply on the bank's construction lending,
but has increased its portfolio of commercial mortgage loans.
The bank now emphasizes advisory services, private placements
and the origination of loans for resale to other
institutions. Under him, Manufacturers was among the first
banks to create a permanent work-out group for bad loans.
   In keeping with the tough-guy image, Mr. Hegarty isn't
sympathetic to borrowers' requests for restructured loans
when a real estate project gets into trouble. "Our
inclination is to move a property out, as opposed to
restructuring the terms," he says. "The economics of
restructuring just don't make sense."
   Previously, Mr. Hegarty says, if a project was successful,
Manufacturers earned interest on the loan. If the project
went sour, Manufacturers was stuck with it. "We can't afford
to do that anymore," he says. "We're not going to take
equity-type risks for interest-rate returns."
   Gone also is the "manana" attitude that things will work
out for troubled projects, he says. A new "early warning"
information system tracks real estate projects and market
conditions on a quarterly basis. "It doesn't make a bad loan
good, but it's your headlights in the marketplace," he says.
   With about 55% of Manufacturers Hanover's total real
estate lending concentrated in Manhattan, Mr. Hegarty has
some definite ideas about the city's real estate picture.
He's most comfortable with prospects for big projects on the
East Side of midtown, where available space is limited and
land for new developments is scarce. The West Side, by
contrast, has too much space. "There's a pretty good chance"
that at least one and maybe more major projects on the West
Side will fail, he says.
   And he sees little likelihood that real estate development
in lower Manhattan will rebound anytime this decade from the
deep recession that has struck the financial services
industry and left an estimated 20% of premium office space
vacant. Any growth that might have occurred in lower
Manhattan will almost certainly be siphoned off, either by
big developments along the New Jersey side of the Hudson
River, where taxes, development costs and rents will be
sharply lower, or by development across the East River in
Brooklyn. The City of New York is subsidizing real estate
development in that borough.

   VILA NOVA DE GAIA, Portugal -- In an office as long as a
tennis court and lined with portraits of royalty in gilded
frames, the managing director of one of Portugal's oldest and
biggest port-wine companies considers a problem of corporate
identity.
   Last year, says Alain Le Grand, Real Cia. Velha accounted
for nearly 12% of world-wide port sales. But still, he
admits, the company "isn't as well known as its market share
would justify."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's not for want of a name. Its official name is a
mouthful: Cia. Geral da Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro
S.A. It's also known as Real Cia. Velha ("royal old
company"), and in English it goes by Royal Oporto Wine Co.
The latter is a trading title adopted from the northern city
of Oporto, which gives port its name.
   Royal Oporto and three subsidiaries together own more than
a dozen brand names. But more than half of the 9.5 million
liters (2.5 million gallons) of port sold by the group last
year was retailed under the brands of other distributors,
such as Tesco and Safeway supermarkets in Britain and William
Pitters in France. The Royal Oporto group may be one of the
biggest port sellers in Portugal, but to the rest of the
world it is little known.
   Establishing a new identity -- that's the mission of new
management. Last year, financial problems prompted the owner
of Royal Oporto, Manuel da Silva Reis, to seek an outside
partner. The result was an agreement with Cofipsa, a
Portugal-based holding company comprising Portuguese and
Spanish investors in association with Cerus S.A., a French
holding company controlled by Italy's Carlo De Benedetti.
   In return for a capital injection of five billion escudos
($34 million), Cofipsa took 40% of Royal Oporto. Mr. Le
Grand, a Frenchman and former chairman of the liqueurs
concern Benedictine S.A., was hired to run it.
   By selling old wine under new labels in new markets, Mr.
Le Grand aims to make Royal Oporto one of the top-selling
port labels in the world. Last year it accounted for only
around 8% of the company's total sales, but officials hope
they can raise that figure to 50%.
   Mr. Le Grand has the additional task of keeping sweet an
alliance between the De Benedetti group and Mr. Silva Reis,
who retains his position as chairman and whose family is
still Royal Oporto's majority shareholder.
   For the moment, both sides say the partnership is going
well. But the toughest changes are still to be made, and Mr.
Silva Reis, a self-made entrepreneur who used to run Royal
Oporto like a personal empire, isn't known as an easy man.
   "I don't know what will happen when we start proposing
aggressive policies," says one of Mr. De Benedetti's
associates.
   The changes at Royal Oporto are part of a wider
restructuring under way in the port trade. In the 1950s, the
trade was fragmented among more than 100 companies. Some were
Portuguese-owned, others belonged to the descendants of
British and Dutch shippers who came to Portugal in the 17th
and 18th centuries. Problems began after World War II with a
slump in sales to Britain. Gradually, takeovers led to the
trade's domination by big companies, many of them
multinationals.
   Today the port business centers on fewer than 30 shipping
companies based in two neighboring cities near the mouth of
the Douro river: Oporto on the north bank, Vila Nova de Gaia
on the south. Only a few market leaders remain privately
held, including the Symington group, last year's biggest
volume shipper. Sandeman belongs to Seagram Co. of Canada;
Cockburn, Smithes is owned by Allied-Lyons PLC of Britain;
Croft is a holding of Grand Metropolitan PLC; and Offley
Forrester is owned by Martini &amp; Rossi of Switzerland.
   The changes in ownership have coincided with a general
shift in the drinks trade away from sales under generic
labels. Port, in addition, has had to contend with a trend
away from sweet, high-alcohol beverages. Port sales have
risen in the past decade, nonetheless. In part, that's the
result of a move up-market by many producers.
   In a business fortified with tradition, Royal Oporto has a
reputation as a maverick. Until recently, its policy was to
sell medium-quality port at competitive prices, either under
its own brands or to other distributors for retail under
their labels.
   In addition to its rich heritage, Royal Oporto has
valuable vineyards. Thanks to stocks totaling around 25
million liters, including around three million liters of
vintage port, Mr. Le Grand says, "I think we have the means
to develop an interesting strategy."
   Mr. Le Grand says one of his first steps has been to work
on a new marketing strategy, expected to be approved at a
board meeting next month. By eliminating minor brands and
concentrating on a few leading ones, he aims to increase the
company's visibility. Royal Oporto will become its main
brand, followed by Real and Silva Reis, a leader in the
French market. Mr. Le Grand also plans to develop new markets
in other countries, as well, including in Asia. In Spain, a
new market for Royal Oporto, the company has appointed as its
distributor Bodegas Berberana, a concern partly owned by
another De Benedetti interest, Cofir S.A., Cerus's Spanish
holding company.
   As the former chairman of Benedictine, Mr. Le Grand has
experience working in a family company. His family was
Benedictine's leading shareholder until the company was taken
over by Martini &amp; Rossi in 1988. At Royal Oporto, Mr. Silva
Reis is chairman of the board and the management committee,
but Mr. Le Grand holds the tie-breaking vote for both panels
in the event of a disagreement between the Silva Reises and
the representatives of the Cofipsa group.

   Japan Apologizes to South Korea's Roh
   For Harsh Colonial Rule of Peninsula

   TOKYO -- In an attempt to bury past grievances between
Japan and South Korea, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
Emperor Akihito both offered apologies to President Roh
Tae-Woo for Japan's harsh colonial rule of the Korean
Peninsula.
   In the strongest statement yet by a Japanese government
official, Mr. Kaifu told Mr. Roh that he felt "sincere
remorse and honest apologies for the fact that there was a
period in our history in which Japanese actions inflicted
unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the Korean
Peninsula."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tone of Japanese regret and reconciliation continued
on through a state banquet hosted by Emperor Akihito in honor
of Mr. Roh. In much anticipated and closely scrutinized
remarks, Emperor Akihito reiterated a statement made by his
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, to former President Chun
Doo Hwan in 1984, and then went further in expressing regret
for the past. "I think of the sufferings your people
underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought
about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret,"
Emperor Akihito said.
   Japanese government officials said the remarks were meant
as clear apologies that identified both the party which
colonized Korea and the party which suffered as a
consequence.
   The issue of an apology for Japan's brutal occupation of
Korea from 1910-1945 has been the focus of Mr. Roh's first
official state visit to Japan, which continues through
Saturday. South Korea had demanded that the emperor himself
apologize for Japan's past actions against it's next-door
neighbor. The South Korean people said the previous Emperor's
remarks were vague and difficult to understand. In 1984,
Emperor Hirohito said: "It is indeed regretable that there
was an unfortunate past between us for a period in this
century and I believe that it should not be repeated again."
   Mr. Roh appeared willing to accept the Japanese apologies.
He said Mr. Kaifu's remarks reflected the "correct
recognition of history." And in a reciprocal toast at the
state banquet, Mr. Roh was quoted as telling the Emperor: "It
is not possible to erase or forget historical facts.
Nevertheless, we must not remain bound up in memories. It is
significant that Your Majesty, the symbol of Japanese history
and the Japanese nation, has shown deep concern about this
matter."
   Just how these remarks will satisfy the South Korean
people remains to be seen. Earlier press reports from Seoul
indicated some dissatisfaction with a draft of the Emperor's
statement shown ahead of time to the South Korean government.
   It is also not entirely clear why Japanese officials who
were previously reluctant to apologize changed their stance.
A Japanese Foreign Ministry official attributed the change in
position to the rise of a new generation of young people who
want to put the past behind, making it politically more
acceptable for Japanese leaders to apologize.
   Not surprisingly, Japanese officials are now eager to put
bilateral relations on a more forward-looking track. During
the first hour-long official state meeting, Mr. Kaifu told
Mr. Roh that Japan will help defray medical costs for Korean
victims of the atomic bomb by contributing about 4 billion
yen ($26.4 million) to efforts in Korea to provide care for
victims still suffering.
   And while there is still some disagreement over the
treatment of first and second generation Korean residents in
Japan, Mr. Kaifu told Mr. Roh that the Japanese government is
willing to continue looking at the issue.
   "We hope to see these problems rooted in the past recede
into the background and to make a new start in building a new
relationship," Mr. Kaifu said.

   Your Money Matters:
   How to Sell Your House in a Soft Market
   ----

   Trying to sell your home in a slow market can be a
frustrating experience, especially for people who have to
move because of a new job and those who have already signed
the contract to buy another house or apartment.
   Yet it's a problem that more and more homeowners are
facing these days because of the sluggish real estate markets
in many parts of the country.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fortunately there are things homeowners can do to increase
their chances of a speedy sale at a fair price. Common sense,
of course, dictates that people trying to sell a home should
get rid of clutter, take the overloaded cat box out of the
kitchen and put eccentric personal items out of sight.
   But real estate experts say that it takes a lot more than
that to move a house or apartment in a glutted market. Among
their suggestions: Start out with the right price; know how
to make a home more marketable; and be open to alternative
forms of financing. If all else fails, leasing the home with
an option to buy can be a solution for some.
   Overpricing is the biggest mistake homeowners make when
trying to sell, says Stanley Perla, regional director of real
estate for accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young in New York. Even in
good markets, he says, sellers overprice their homes. In a
slow market, they may find themselves dropping the price
repeatedly as the months go by -- and giving their property a
bad reputation.
   Avoiding that can mean discarding emotional baggage about
what could have been. If homeowners bought the house for
$150,000, and it was "worth" $200,000 two years ago at the
top of the market, "they think that selling it for $175,000
gives them a loss of $25,000," says Martin Shenkman, an
attorney who specializes in real estate and taxes in New
York. The reality is that "they actually have a gain."
   Starting with a lower asking price may be easier if
homeowners keep in mind that they'll also probably have to
pay less for a new home, real estate experts say.
   To get a good idea of a competitive price, they advise
soliciting opinions from three brokers. "You want to weed out
those who may overprice to get the listing, and later drop
the price, saying that the market was softer than he thought,
or those who drastically underprice it to move it quickly,"
says Mr. Shenkman, co-author (with Warren Boroson) of the
book "How to Sell Your House in a Buyer's Market."
   Choose top firms, real estate advisers say, and ask for
agents who are top sellers and graduates of the Real Estate
Institute or certified residential specialists.
   Some experts recommend offering the broker an incentive,
such as an extra percentage point commission or cash if they
sell the home within the agreed-upon period, such as two
months.
   Sellers can help market their home by preparing a fact
sheet that includes a floor plan, utility and insurance
costs, and maintenance fees. Ideally, fact sheets should
answer most buyers' questions, and point out features that
make the home particularly desirable, such as proximity to
schools or supermarkets.
   Sellers should also figure on spending as much as several
thousand dollars on fresh paint, a professional cleaning job
or having the floors refinished. "When I sold my apartment, I
paid for a maid three times a week, had windows
professionally cleaned, and bought fresh flowers. This sort
of thing sounds simple-minded, but these petty little things
that people think are so obvious are really critical in this
market," says Mr. Shenkman.
   If the house still isn't selling and desperation is
setting in, real estate experts have additional suggestions:
   -- Offer to pay the closing costs. This is an indirect way
of lowering the price of your home, and is particularly
appealing to first-time buyers who may be short of cash.
   -- Consider seller financing. This involves giving the
buyers a second mortgage for some of the down payment. "It
will help some properties sell more quickly by attracting
buyers who may not have enough cash," says Dorcas Helfant,
vice president of the National Association of Realtors.
   The primary drawback is that if the buyer defaults, the
bank that holds the first mortgage has the primary claim.
   -- Lease with an option to buy. This is involves renting
the house and allowing the tenants to apply a portion of
rent, say 15%, toward a down payment. Homeowners who do this
may be able to write off depreciation, maintenance, utilities
and mortgage interest.
   The restrictions on deducting losses are the same as for
rental losses under ordinary circumstances: Taxpayers with
incomes under $100,000 can take up to $25,000 in rental
losses each year; this phases out at $150,000. To demonstrate
to the Internal Revenue Service that they haven't converted
their residence to rental property, homeowners should keep
the property listed for sale.
   They should also note that this approach can be very risky
if they have a capital gain on their home. If they want to
avoid paying tax on the gain, they will have to roll it over
into a new home within two years.
   Getting a bad tenant is another risk, as a Maryland woman
who rented out her house in December learned the hard way.
Adele Conover says she relied on a real estate agency to
screen the tenants. But they not only didn't pay, they broke
all her appliances. And she says that local police told her
the male tenant tried to set fire to the house when his
companion locked him out after he tried to kill her.
   One final tip: Hard as it may be to accept, the first
offer is often the best, real estate experts say. That
doesn't mean you shouldn't negotiate. But while the real
estate market may be new to you, the people making the offer
have usually been looking for months, know what they want and
have a pretty good idea what market prices are.

   Yen Rises on Strong Japanese Economy;
   Mark Sags on Unification Nervousness

   NEW YORK -- The dollar came full circle from its recent
rally against the yen by finishing just above 151 yen
yesterday on a renewed market appreciation of Japan's robust
economy.
   The mark weakened against the dollar, though, its strength
sapped by continued market nervousness about the costs of
German unification.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6830 marks, up from 1.6765 marks late Wednesday, and at
151.05 yen, down from 151.45 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6895, down from $1.6940 late Wednesday.
   At midmorning Friday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at
150.75 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 151.43 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6825
marks.
   The apparent recovery of Japanese stocks from their plunge
early this year has removed a temporary factor that had
turned participants' focus away from the underlying strength
of the Japanese economy, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist
at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
   Release earlier in the day of a sharp downward revision of
U.S. first-quarter gross national product to an annual growth
rate of 1.3% didn't have much effect on trading.
   Traders said the fall from the originally announced 2.1%
annual rate was due to an unusually large fall in business
inventories that in itself doesn't change the outlook for
continued modest growth in the U.S. economy. Expectations
were for a downward revision to 1.8% annual growth.
   The recent rally by the dollar against the yen, which
began May 16, was fueled mainly by a belief that inflationary
pressures were rising in Japan at a time when monetary
authorities are reluctant to raise interest rates for fear of
once again plunging the stock market into disarray,
participants said. The dollar last ended New York trading
below 151 yen on May 15, when it closed at 150.83 yen.
   But sustained trading of the Nikkei stock index at levels
around 32,000 points in the past week, along with the
prospect of an easing of inflationary pressures due to
stabilizing prices, have lent support to the Bank of Japan's
policy of steady rates, Mr. Sohn said. The Nikkei average
rose 135.24 points Thursday to close at 32,311.75.
   The unexpectedly sharp downward revision in U.S.
first-quarter GNP was accompanied by an unchanged estimation
of the implicit price deflator at a 5.7% annual rate.
   The GNP growth rate announcement was neutral for the
dollar when taken with the inflation figure because figures
showing a sluggish economy and continuing inflationary
pressure had been expected, participants said. Taken
together, the numbers mean the Federal Reserve still doesn't
have any reason to change its policy of maintaining steady
interest rates, they said.
   The fall in inventories, which swung to a revised decline
of $5.9 billion in the quarter from an originally announced
gain of $2.6 billion, was discounted partly because of
inventories' volatility and partly due to their natural
tendency to rebound from a fall to a gain the next quarter,
participants said.
   Meanwhile, the mark weakened against the dollar and other
currencies on continued nervousness about how much
unification will end up costing West Germany, said Peter
Iversen, a trader at Shawmut Bank of Boston N.A.
   Late in the New York day, the Treasury said that a comment
made earlier by Assistant Treasury Secretary Sidney Jones
that the dollar is undervalued against all major currencies
except the yen wasn't meant to suggest a change in the
Treasury's views on the dollar.
   Mr. Jones's remark ruffled the market briefly, spurring
selling of the mark against the yen, traders said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $366.50 an ounce, up $2.40. Estimated
volume was a heavy five million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $368.45 an ounce.

   GM Wins Wall Street's Applause
   On Strength of Plant Closings

   DETROIT -- At General Motors' annual meeting here today,
executives probably will tell shareholders that things are
looking up at the No. 1 auto maker. And for once, Wall Street
will agree.
   GM stock "looks like a really terrific opportunity," says
money manager Mario J. Gabelli in New York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What is so terrific about an auto stock at a time of
skidding car sales and a sluggish economy? The answer
probably won't be spoken out loud at the meeting, because it
involves two nasty words: plant closings.
   Slowly and quietly, GM is moving to close enough plants to
be able to operate its North American factories at full
capacity, boosting its lagging domestic profits. The Street
applauds this Ultra Slim-Fast routine and its potential
long-term rewards, both for GM and for other auto makers.
   "If I was pressed on what is the sleeper group for the
second half, I would say autos," says Byron R. Wien,
portfolio strategist for Morgan Stanley. "That is one group
that has been beaten down."
   John Neff, head of the $8 billion Windsor Fund, calls auto
stocks "attractive, particularly for those who believe in the
soft-landing" scenario for the economy.
   GM isn't just waiting for the economy to bail it out, and
that's what has analysts upbeat about the No. 1 auto maker.
In a series of announcements dribbled out since early 1988,
GM has "indefinitely idled" or laid plans to close four
car-assembly plants and three truck plants over the next
three years.
   What's more, GM is converting three car plants to truck
production. With those conversions, GM is eliminating a total
of seven passenger-car plants -- just one less than Ford
Motor has in the U.S.
   The idled plants aren't officially closed and written off
the books because that isn't allowed under the current labor
contract. But the shutdowns are real, nonetheless, and they
represent some 1.4 million vehicles that GM won't have to
sell to get its plants running at full speed.
   Philip Fricke of Prudential-Bache Securities argued in a
recent report that GM needs just one more plant closing by
1993 to boost its factory operating rate to a healthy 90%
from the current 80% level. "I think they are virtually
there" in terms of solving the excess-capacity problem, says
Mr. Fricke. That's why his report reaffirms a buy
recommendation on GM, despite the industrywide slump in auto
sales this spring.
   At Morgan Stanley, analyst Scott Merlis says GM's
capacity-cutting plans have led him to boost his earnings
estimates for the company. GM's annual earnings for the
1990-1995 period should average $8 a share, Mr. Merlis now
says, instead of the $7 a share he previously estimated. He,
too, says now is the time to buy GM.
   What's more, GM's retreat could provide something of a
peace dividend for all the auto makers that compete in North
America, says analyst John Casesa of Wertheim Schroeder.
   "GM has been the spoiler for pricing in the industry," he
says. The giant auto maker, through its frantic efforts to
move merchandise by offering big rebates and other discounts,
has forced domestic and foreign companies to discount their
wares, too, hurting profits. "If they {GM} fix their
capacity, it will help everybody out," Mr. Casesa says.
   Indeed, by 1992, GM will have cut its North American
car-building capacity to about 4.3 million cars from more
than 6 million cars in 1986, according to figures compiled by
the WEFA Group, an economic-forecasting concern in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa. (Mr. Fricke puts his 1992-93 number at 4.4
million cars.) Last year, GM sold about four million North
American-built cars in the U.S., Canada and overseas.
   If GM can sustain this pace, its factories can run at 90%
speed, spreading the company's fixed costs over a greater
number of vehicles and boosting profitability. That isn't
100%, but bullish analysts say GM could run close to full
speed in a strong sales year.
   GM's stock has been swept up in the recent stock-market
rally. Yesterday, the shares closed at 48 3/8, off 5/8, after
Wednesday's reports of lower than expected mid-May car sales
for the Big 3 auto makers.
   But the shares still are up 9% from the end of April.
Since Dec. 31, GM has outperformed both the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.
   Are there skeptics left? Absolutely.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Joseph Phillippi says he's
waiting for evidence of a "significant improvement in market
share that I could view as sustainable" before changing his
opinion that GM stock will lag the broader market.
   The man in charge of GM's North American vehicle business,
president-elect Lloyd E. Reuss, says the company's car market
share could eventually rise back to 40% from the current
35.5% level. But GM's market-share projections have proved
too optimistic for years, and some analysts say GM isn't
through losing ground to Ford or the Japanese. If new
products slated for the early 1990s don't capture the
public's fancy better than those on which GM bet billions in
the 1980s, the company's North American comeback could stall
out.
   Also, much of GM's remaining underused capacity is in
relatively new plants that are building unpopular products,
such as the GM-10 line of midsized cars. GM can ill afford to
abandon these facilities. So this fall, analysts expect, GM's
divisions will redouble efforts to sell the GM-10 models,
which are the Chevrolet Lumina sedan, Pontiac Grand Prix,
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Buick Regal. New ads, fresh
exterior and interior designs and possibly lower prices could
all be part of the strategy. All will cost big money.
   But even skeptics say GM is on the right track -- and is
finally moving to match production to market share rather
than the other way around.
   GM chairman-elect Robert C. Stempel's goal is to have GM's
North American factories running as profitably as the
European operations he helped turn around in the mid-1980s.
Three of GM's European car plants now run on three-shift
production schedules that allow them to boost output by
nearly half. (U.S. plants generally run two shifts.)
   Such aggressive moves helped GM to earn more than $1,100
average profit for every vehicle it sold in Europe last year.
By contrast, the company earned just $277 for each vehicle
sold in the U.S. and Canada. (Both figures include some
profit from GM's finance and technology units, but a much
larger share of GM's domestic profit comes from non-auto
operations.)
   GM bulls caution that Europe-like profits won't emerge
from GM's North American operations overnight. But in the
meantime, there's always GM's $3 annual dividend rate, which
gives the stock a respectable 6.2% yield to tide over
investors who have the patience to wait a while.

   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange barred from
membership a former Teletype operator for Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co., who the Big Board said misappropriated an
attache case, containing $12,700, that an exchange member
left on the trading floor.
   The exchange also found that the teletypist, Cosimo Louis
Pellegrino, a resident of Brooklyn, made material
misstatements to the Big Board in connection with the
incident.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Pellegrino couldn't be reached for comment. Smith
Barney declined to comment.
   In January 1988, the exchange said, a floor broker, whom
the exchange declined to identify, left the attache case on
the floor of his booth and then left the area. When the
broker returned, the case was missing.
   The floor broker asked Mr. Pellegrino about it, and the
teletypist told him that an individual who worked on the
floor took the briefcase. Mr. Pellegrino also said he would
try to get it back. A couple of days later, Mr. Pellegrino
returned the attache case to the broker, but $900 of the
$12,700 was missing.
   It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for floor brokers to
have cash on the exchange floor; some independent brokers use
their booths on the floor as offices and may have some cash
around for operations or personal reasons.
   Mr. Pellegrino gave the Big Board the alleged
perpetrator's name and address and said he worked on the
floor. The exchange checked its employment records,
interviewed floor employees, sent certified letters to the
address Mr. Pellegrino provided, contacted the owner of the
building there, and tried to get a phone number for the
individual, all to no avail.
   An exchange hearing panel found that Mr. Pellegrino took
the case and lied about how he got it.

   Imagine Films' Harris
   Leaves to Be Producer

   LOS ANGELES -- After months of negotiations, Imagine Films
Entertainment Inc. said Robert A. Harris, who had been
president of motion pictures and television since 1988, left
the company to become an independent producer.
   Mr. Harris said he decided to leave the entertainment
company because he wasn't spending as much time as he'd like
on Imagine's motion picture activities and instead was
concentrating on TV. Mr. Harris formerly was president of MCA
Inc.'s TV group, but he wants to make movies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   No less than two of Imagine's annual shareholder meetings
were postponed as a result of the debate over Mr. Harris's
complex termination agreement with the company. Mr. Harris,
who was less than two years into a five-year contract, owns a
stake in Imagine, and his compensation was tied to the
company's profits under various complicated formulas. He was
also a director (he has relinquished his board seat), which
the company said accounted for the meeting postponements. In
April, the meeting was called off at the last minute, sending
Imagine shares soaring on apparent speculation that the
company was on the brink of being acquired.
   Mr. Harris will produce his first two motion pictures for
Imagine, whose co-chief executive officers are Brian Grazer
and actor/director Ron Howard. Imagine recently placed a TV
series, "Parenthood," on NBC's fall lineup. Imagine produced
the film of the same name for MCA's Universal Pictures. MCA
owns a 25% stake in Imagine, assuming conversion of warrants
and bonds, and has an agreement to distribute most of
Imagine's movies. But Carolco Pictures Inc. will distribute
the coming movie, "The Doors," to be directed by Oliver
Stone.

   Service America Says

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Service America Corp. said it is in
default on a $195 million loan from General Electric Capital
Corp. and expects its losses to widen for the fiscal year
ended March 31.
   The food-service company blamed higher operating costs,
increased competition, and weakness in factory employment in
automobile plants and textile mills where it has significant
operations. The company also cited special charges for
severance and relocation expenses related to senior
management changes made in the last six months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Service America said its senior creditor, GE Capital,
advised the company that under the loan accord, Service
America won't be permitted to make any payments on its
subordinated debt. The company said a $10.8 million interest
payment on its $127 million subordinated debt is due June 15.
   Service America said it and GE Capital, a unit of General
Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn., are discussing a
restructuring of its senior and subordinated debt. The
company plans to file a registration statement within 45 days
to offer a proposal to restructure its subordinated debt.
Meanwhile, it expects to be able to conduct normal operations
and to continue to draw against its $70 million
revolving-credit agreement with GE Capital to make payments
to suppliers, employees and other third parties except for
subordinated creditors.
   Service America said it expects to report that net losses
in the fiscal-fourth quarter and full year widened but that
revenue increased in both periods. In the fourth quarter of
last year, the company reported a net loss of $6.3 million on
revenue of $256.1 million. For the full 1989 fiscal year,
Service America had a net loss of $14.4 million on revenue of
$1.04 billion.

   Directors Approve
   2-for-1 Stock Split

   HOUSTON -- Compaq Computer Corp., whose stock price has
sailed well above $100 a share, said its directors approved a
2-for-1 split of its common stock.
   The fast-growing computer concern said it believes the
move will make its stock more affordable for smaller
shareholders. Institutions hold an estimated 70% to 75% of
Compaq's shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, companies often split their shares in the
belief that a lower price will help the stock price keep
rising. Compaq closed at $122, down 87.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Compaq said the stock split will be paid July 6 to holders
of record June 29.
   Daniel C. Benton, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
said the move shows that Compaq, the nation's third-largest
maker of personal computers, is confident about its
prospects. But, he said, "I don't know that there is a whole
lot of empirical evidence that when you split a stock, the
stock does better.
   "I think it's mainly psychological for the companies," he
said.
   Since February, Compaq shares have soared to more than
$120 from around $80. Other technology stocks also have
climbed, fed by European demand for computers and
stronger-than-expected U.S. sales. Analysts attributed
Compaq's surge to renewed shareholder confidence after
Compaq's first-quarter earnings, reported last month,
surpassed most expectations. The company said net income rose
11% to $92.2 million, or $2.13 a share. Sales increased 28%
to $872.2 million.
   Compaq said in February that its share of the market for
high-end personal computers was dropping and warned of
stiffer competition in the personal-computer business. But it
said an unexpected 56% rise in overseas sales helped fuel its
first-quarter earnings increases.
