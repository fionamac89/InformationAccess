   Who'll Challenge the Lakers?

   Portland, Ore. -- It is no slam on the NBA dunkers to note
that, in recent years, the loop's playoffs have been as
predictable as the tides. All through the 1980s, one could
(and some did) make book that the Los Angeles Lakers would be
alive in June to play the team-of-the-moment from the East
for what is grandiosely -- but not inaccurately -- called the
World's Championship.
   Yes, the Lakers had to deal first with the other outfits
in the Western Conference, but they did so briskly. In making
the finals in five of the past six seasons, L.A.'s playoff
record in the West was 55 wins and 12 losses. Last year it
swept its confreres 11-0 before injuries to starting guards
Magic Johnson and Byron Scott spoiled its chances against the
Detroit Pistons in the crown round.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's possible that this pattern might be repeated this
term. The Lakers may be Kareemless but their offense still
looks seamless, and their 63-19 mark was the league's best in
the regular campaign that ended Sunday. But it just could be
that the rest of the West could offer a stiffer test when the
playoffs commence this week.
   Competition could come from a number of sectors. With
David Robinson, the world's tallest sailor, on board, the San
Antonio Spurs added 35 wins to their 1988-89 total of 21 and
became the league's most improved team ever. Karl Malone,
Mark Eaton and Thurl Bailey give the Utah Jazz the West's
most imposing silhouette except for the Rockies.
   But the toughest intra-conference challenge to the Lakers
could come from the Portland Trailblazers. Tucked away in the
nation's upper left-hand corner, and usually playing too late
for the late news just about everywhere save home, the
Blazers quietly posted a 59-23 log this season, tying the
defending-champ Pistons for second best. Perhaps more
impressive, they beat the Lakers three times in five tries,
including a gargantuan, 130-88, whomping here Sunday night.
   It would be unwise to make too much of Sunday's outcome,
because the real Lakers didn't show. Having already clinched
everything clinchable, Coach Pat Riley declared the contest
insignificant for his team. He let Scott stay home to nurse a
sprained ankle and gave three other starters -- Johnson,
James Worthy and Mychal Thompson -- a full game of bench
rest.
   Nonetheless, the Blazers claimed the "W" happily because
it allowed them to set a franchise record for most wins in a
season, and it marked the first time a Portland team ever
posted a .500 or better record against every NBA foe.
   Those things were important, averred Rick Adelman, the
43-year-old Portland coach. "They're measuring sticks that
mark our progress," he said. "With a history like ours, we
need all the evidence of success we can get."
   Adelman's hearkening to Blazer history is appropriate,
because he has played a unique part in it. Twenty years ago,
his sideburns down to his chops, he filled a guard post on
the franchise's first starting five, and, later, was brought
back as an assistant to Jack Ramsay, the coach who guided the
club in its sole glory year, its memorable 1977 league title.
Despite having head-coaching experience only at Chemeteka
Community College, in Salem, Ore., Adelman replaced Mike
Schuler in the Blazers' top job in the middle of last season,
which ended with a 39-43 won-lost record, and was rehired for
this one.
   Schuler was a hard-driving type, while Adelman's is a
looser hand on the tiller, something for which many Blazers
have publicly expressed appreciation.
   The other major change in the team came through an
off-season trade that liberated forward Buck Williams from
the New Jersey Nets for center Sam Bowie and a No. 1 draft
choice. Williams, a demon rebounder and selfless sort,
brought along a work ethic that was an improvement over what
was here.
   "We've liked each other better, and worked harder, since
Rick and Buck came," said Clyde "The Glide" Drexler, the
dunk-master Portland guard, in the winner's locker room
Sunday. "Different people, different chemistry. Better
chemistry," affirmed Terry Porter, Drexler's guard mate.
   With Williams joining 7-foot-tall, 270-pound center Kevin
Duckworth, and bouncy forward Jerome Kersey, the Blazers were
the NBA's best rebounding team this season. More to the
point, the always-high-scoring Portlanders gave up fewer --
points that is -- producing one of the league's best scoring
ratios.
   "We began the season with the goals of rebounding better
and improving our defense, and we followed through," said
Adelman. "It didn't take much of a selling job. The guys
who'd been here before didn't want to keep doing what they'd
done."
   Adelman says the final proof of the pudding was not only
in winning, but in winning on the road; Portland ended up as
one of only six NBA teams with more victories than defeats in
unfriendly confines. That their road kills included such
worthies as Boston, Philadelphia and the Lakers gives them
special hope that they'll break their dismal string of four
straight first-round playoff defeats.
   Further proof of the Blazers' improved estate could be
found in Sunday's action. While the game was one-sided, it
was not pacific: Five technical fouls were called, including
a couple in a second-period shoving match. "Maybe they wanted
to establish something with us even with their subs in," said
Williams.
   The unpassable Buck, eyes agleam with the pleasure of a
winning campaign after eight years in the New Jersey swamps,
also saw favorable portents in the Lakers' concession: "Maybe
Pat (Riley) figured that a `real' loss to us tonight would
give us a psychological advantage going into the playoffs, so
he sat his regulars. That would mean they're thinking about
us, wouldn't it? Well, maybe they should."

   Premark Agrees
   To Buy Sikes Corp.
   For $201 Million

   DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Premark International Inc. said it
agreed to acquire Sikes Corp. for $16.40 a share, or about
$201 million.
   The consumer and restaurant products concern also reported
a 41% drop in its first-quarter earnings due to declining
performance at its Tupperware unit and Food Equipment Group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under its agreement with Sikes, Premark said it will soon
launch a tender offer for all of the Lakeland, Fla.,
concern's roughly 11 million Class A common shares
outstanding at $16.40 a share; Premark also will purchase
861,136 Class B Sikes common shares for $26.78 apiece.
   Acquisition of Sikes, a maker of ceramic tile, will mark a
"major step forward" in the company's bid to increase its
presence in the decorative building products industry,
Premark said. Sikes had sales of $137 million for its fiscal
year ended Feb. 28.
   The transaction, to be financed with cash on hand and
short-term borrowing, is subject, among other things, to
antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of Sikes's
Class A shares on a fully diluted basis.
   In the latest period, Premark had net income of $13.2
million, or 39 cents a share, compared with $22.4 million, or
64 cents a share in the first quarter of 1989. Sales rose
2.8% to $620.1 million from $603 million.
   Profit at Tupperware was hurt by lower sales in Latin
America, the U.S. and Japan, and higher expenses in Europe.
Premark said that although the Food Equipment Group reported
higher sales, profit fell primarily because of lower domestic
production volume and reduced margins.
   Premark also said it expects lower profit for the second
quarter as "declining dealer activity remains a challenge for
Tupperware's U.S. business and difficult industry conditions
hamper its food equipment group's domestic operations," as
well as certain other businesses.
   In the second quarter of 1989, Premark earned $23.7
million, or 68 cents a share, on sales of $657.9 million.
   The company added that results for the full year remain
"uncertain at this time;" it continues to be "optimistic
long-term."
   News of the tender offer sparked a jump in Sikes shares,
which closed at $16.125, up $3.875, in composite American
Stock Exchange trading. In composite New York Stock Exchange
trading, Premark shares slipped 12.5 cents to close at
$22.625.
   Late yesterday, Moody's Investors Service placed Premark's
approximately $230 million in long-term debt under review for
a possible downgrade. The rating company said its review will
focus on the increased leverage and "lower coverage
measurements" that would result from the acquisition, "as
well as {Premark's} continuing weaker profitability." Moody's
also said it will examine the "potential synergies"
management expects to obtain from the deal.

   A federal appeals court in New York has allowed an ailing
railroad to sue Conrail for allegedly setting monopolistic
freight rates.
   The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a
lower court decision dismissing the case. Delaware &amp; Hudson
Railway Co., which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings,
sued Conrail in 1986 over alleged antitrust violations in
Conrail's rate-setting policy.

   Delaware &amp; Hudson had to rely on part of the Conrail
system when it shipped newsprint from Canada to the middle
Atlantic states. In its suit, the company alleges that a
change in Conrail's rates in the early 1980s forced it out of
that market.
   The appeals court in Manhattan ruled that the lower-court
judge failed to adequately consider Conrail's monopolistic
power. The court said Delaware &amp; Hudson either had to give up
its business in the market or pay a sharp increase to Conrail
that would wipe out its profits on the middle Atlantic route.
   Delaware &amp; Hudson, one of Conrail's few rail-freight
competitors in the Northeast, filed for Chapter 11 protection
in 1988. James K. Manning, an attorney for Delaware &amp; Hudson,
said the change in Conrail's rate-setting policy contributed
to the railroad's financial troubles. "In our view, this has
been part of the problem," said Mr. Manning. "We were denied
any economic access in this market." For Delaware &amp; Hudson,
the newsprint market was "quite important because it happens
to be a market that was well-suited to rail traffic," Mr.
Manning said.
   Attorneys for Conrail, a private rail freight company set
up by Congress in 1976, couldn't be reached for comment.
   Conrail, based in Philadelphia, had claimed in the
district court that its practices weren't anti-competitive
because it was merely trying to maximize its profits. The
appeals court, however, said that considering Conrail's
control over the market, there are grounds for a trial to
determine whether the rate policy was monopolistic. Delaware
&amp; Hudson is seeking damages of more than $5 million, which
would be trebled under antitrust law.

   HEART SURGEON wins $29 million libel verdict in Texas.
   A state court jury in San Antonio awarded the damages to
Sudhir Srivastava, a heart surgeon who alleged that his
practice was destroyed by stories broadcast by a local
television station owned by Harte-Hankes Communications Inc.
The award is believed to be the largest libel verdict ever
issued in Texas.
   The station, KENS-TV in San Antonio, carried a series of
reports in 1985 stating that a group of physicians, including
Dr. Srivastava, had performed unnecessary surgery on elderly
patients for profit. Dr. Srivastava sued for libel,
contending the stories were false, and that they had ruined
his reputation.
   James Branton, a San Antonio attorney with Branton &amp; Hall,
which represented the plaintiff, said his client didn't get
another patient for more than three years, was hit with a
"flood" of malpractice suits and eventually had to relocate
to Midland, Texas, where he now practices.
   The jury's award, issued April 10, included $11.5 million
in actual damages and $17.5 million in punitive damages. The
verdict still must be reviewed by State District Court Judge
Carolyn Spears, who could uphold it, reduce it or set it
aside.
   Mark Cannan, a San Antonio attorney with Lang, Ladon,
Green, Coghlan &amp; Fisher, counsel for Harte-Hanks, said he
will appeal if the verdict is approved.
   "I feel there are various and substantial grounds for
appeal," he said, declining to elaborate.

   SOVIET SANCTIONS in Lithuania jeopardize opportunities for
U.S. lawyers.
   American law firms promoting joint ventures in the Soviet
Union are concluding that now is not the time to move into
the Baltic republics. James Dobkin, who leads Arnold &amp;
Porter's international joint venture practice, says that his
clients who had considered such projects have decided that
they are unthinkable now, "at least for the immediate
future."
   Ed Lieberman, a partner at the Washington-based firm of
Cole Corette &amp; Abrutyn, agrees that American law firms and
their clients are staying away from the Baltics "as a result
of concerns about Lithuania."
   Tensions in Lithuania are having less effect on American
legal entrepreneurship elsewhere in the Soviet Union. But Mr.
Lieberman worries that rising tensions in Lithuania could
scuttle trade and tax treaties being readied for discussion
at the May summit, which in turn could slow the efforts of
American law firms trying to develop a Soviet market for
their clients.
   Assistant U.S. trade representative Peter Allegeier told
lawyers and businessmen last week that the U.S. is assuming
that events in Lithuania won't disrupt trade.

   ATTORNEY GENERAL pessimistic about recouping losses from
S&amp;L fraud.
   "I don't think a lot of this money is available," said
U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, after a speech
yesterday in Dallas. Recovery is complicated, he said,
because "some of those assets have been dissipated," and some
of the top suspects have sought bankruptcy-court protection.
   But the U.S. Justice Department is making an effort to
obtain restitution in certain instances. In Dallas last week,
Justice Department prosecutor Robert Hauberg urged a federal
judge to order Woody F. Lemons, former chief executive
officer of defunct Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association of
Dallas, to turn over $9.7 million to the government. U.S.
District Judge Robert B. Maloney hasn't ruled on the
restitution request but he isn't expected to treat the
prosecutor's motion lightly.
   Earlier this month, the judge sentenced Mr. Lemons to 30
years in federal prison, one of the stiffest terms to date in
a thrift-related fraud case.

   PATENT RAID: Baker &amp; Botts, a Houston law firm, raided the
Dallas law firm of Baker, Mills &amp; Glast for lawyers
specializing in patent law. Baker &amp; Botts recruited name
partner Jerry W. Mills and as many as 11 associates,
according to E. William Barnett, managing partner of Baker &amp;
Botts. Mr. Mills, 49 years old, will head Baker &amp; Botts's
patent section. Robert A. Baker, managing director of
90-lawyer Baker, Mills, said his law firm has not yet decided
on a new name.

   Over-the-counter stocks slumped, with many investors
watching from the sidelines as others pounded the shares of
companies with poor earnings -- particularly Digital
Microwave and Westmark International.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 5.71 to 420.08, or 1.3%,
to the lowest level since Feb. 23. Declining stocks outpaced
advancers more than two to one, while 226 issues hit new lows
and only 38 reached new highs. Volume was a light 125.9
million shares, down from 150.3 million Friday.

   "They're crucifying these stocks" with earnings
disappointments, said James Tarantino, head of OTC trading at
San Francisco-based Hambrecht &amp; Quist. He added that many
investors stayed out of the market as they kept their eye on
the falling Dow Jones Industrial Average and as rising bond
yields began to look attractive.
   "It was a chicken market," said Stephen Lieber of Lieber &amp;
Co., manager of the $800 million Evergreen Funds in Purchase,
N.Y. Mr. Lieber said his firm was selectively buying shares
across the board, but added that offerings were "very thin"
and it was difficult to fill buy orders.
   While earnings disappointments continued to clobber
stocks, Mr. Lieber pointed to the welcome 37% jump in shares
of Concept, a maker of medical equipment based in Largo, Fla.
Late Friday, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced it agreed to buy
Concept in a stock swap valued at $205 million. Concept
closed at 17 5/8, up 4 3/4, and was among the day's most
active issue.
   Digital Microwave, on the other hand, lost nearly half its
market value, plunging 13 7/8 to 14 1/8. The company
announced late Friday that fourth-quarter earnings will be
substantially lower than expected. Hambrecht &amp; Quist yanked
its purchase recommendation on shares of the San Jose,
Calif.-based maker of telecommunications equipment, according
to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. More than 2.4
million shares changed hands, better than 20 times average
daily volume.
   Westmark International also fell hard on earnings news,
dropping 9 1/2 to 40 1/2 on 1.5 million shares, more than 12
times average volume. The Seattle, Wash.-based maker of
medical electronic equipment said that earnings for the
second quarter ending in June would fall below first-quarter
earnings of 52 cents a share reported yesterday, which
included a credit of four cents a share. The company said it
plans to increase spending for research and development.
   In the same vein, Addington Resources dropped 1 3/4 to 16
3/4 amid expectations the Ashland, Ky., coal company will
report disappointing first-quarter earnings, according to
Professional Investor Report.
   BayBanks gained 1 3/8 to 15 1/2 on more than three times
average volume after declaring a regular quarterly dividend.
In late March, the Boston bank said it would consider whether
to pay the dividend.
   Pacific Bancorp gained 3/4 to 4 1/2 after the Bakersfield,
Calif., bank said late Friday it's exploring the possible
sale or merger of the concern. However, no offers are
pending.
   Dyansen gained 9/16 to 1 15/16 amid some speculation that
the value of the company's limited editions of Erte's
sculpture would rise following the death of the artist.
However, the company told PIR that it's premature to
calculate the impact of Erte's death on the value of its
limited editions.
   Bucking the day's trend was MCI Communications, which
added 1/8 to 34 5/8. The telecommunications giant said it
received an $18 million, three-year contract from CBS to
provide its VNET, or Virtual Private Network Service, to all
of CBS's facilities in the U.S.
   Trading was heavy in Flow International after six senior
executives announced they are resigning from the company
effective May 1. Shares of the company fell 5/16 to 4 7/16 on
244,200 shares, well ahead of average daily volume.
   In memoranda sent to institutional investors and the
media, the executives said that Flow, a Kent, Wash.-based
maker of waterjet systems used for industrial cutting, failed
to properly highlight three of the resignations when it
announced Friday that it may hire an investment banker to
find ways to boost shareholders' value.
   The company's news release mentioned that the three
resignations of the controller, corporate secretary and a
vice president had been accepted. The other three were
director of international sales, director of operations and
director of engineering.
   The company's chairman and chief executive, Michael Pao,
said in an interview the managers disagreed with him about
whether to seek a buyer for the company and whether to
abruptly or gradually close down the company's Taiwan
operation. Mr. Pao said he favors finding a buyer for the
company while its profits are expected to grow at about 30% a
year for the next two years.
   The six managers claimed in the memoranda that the company
has failed to disclose the ongoing turmoil at the company.

   TWELVE-HOUR TRADING:
                                                                                                       

   In the next few weeks, the National Association of
Securities Dealers will take the first regulatory step toward
expanding the Nasdaq trading day to 12 hours for some stocks
and extending its trading system overseas.
   The new Nasdaq system will allow market makers in London
to trade in certain Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange listed
securities as if they were in the U.S., while U.S. market
makers will be able to actively participate in the U.K.
trading day.
   NASD attorneys are expected to file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission for the necessary rule changes within
the next month. The NASD hopes to have the system up and
running by Sept. 1.
   However, the plans have elicited little excitement on Wall
Street, where traders would have to be up and awake between
3:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. EST, while traders in London will have
to stay at work into the dark hours.
   "You need a lot of people doing it, otherwise it will be a
very illiquid market before hours," says Robert Rolland,
executive vice president of international equities trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   "We think it's going to start lightly," says Joseph
Hardiman, president of the NASD. "Over time, as people become
accustomed to a new environment, we think it will grow."

   Wasserstein's Girl Talk
   ----
   By Donna Rifkind

<LP>
   "Frankly, I have always found body hair a hassle." "I've
grown to hate my telephone." "Liking myself means liking diet
Jell-O." Where have we heard this before? It's the kind of
talk that's usually accompanied by Streisand on the stereo
and General Foods International Coffees, the kind that makes
a lot of men go, "Uh oh" and head for the Superbowl of
Motocross. It's that universal language called girl talk, and
it's what fills most of the pages of playwright Wendy
Wasserstein's first book of essays, "Bachelor Girls" (Knopf,
209 pages, $16.95).
   If there's one thing girl talk isn't, it's weighty, and
although Ms. Wasserstein throws in a few references to
Stendhal and Schopenhauer, to prove that nail-polish fumes
haven't completely destroyed her Mount Holyoke-educated
brain, most of the essays in Ms. Wasserstein's collection are
frivolous as can be. There are short pieces on manicures
("Nails: The Naked and the Red"), weight loss ("To Live and
Diet") and men's shopping habits ("Reflections on Leather
Rhinos"). There are candid confessions: We learn, for
instance, that Ms. Wasserstein's favorite perfumes include
L'Heure Bleue and Parure ("which, by the way, you can't get
in the States, even at Bergdorf's"), and that her underpants
of choice are Christian Dior lace-top panties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We may wonder why we've been elected to share these
intimacies. Wendy Wasserstein is, after all, a celebrity, a
well-known playwright whose hit show "The Heidi Chronicles"
won both a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award last year. Why is
she now in my living room, slathered in Nutribel Nourishing
Hydrating Emulsion and giggling about "The World's Worst
Boyfriends"?
   The answer has to do with that official organ of girl-talk
dissemination, the woman's magazine. Many of the essays in
"Bachelor Girls" originally appeared in New York Woman's
monthly column called "The Meaning of Life." The inspiration
for each probably emerged from a chat with some
celebrity-savvy editor who called to ask, "Hey Wen, what do
you say to giving us 1,500 words about plaid?" And so the
obliging Ms. Wasserstein produced "The Good, the Plaid, and
the Ugly," in which she makes startling disclosures about her
lifetime infatuation with you-know-what.
   To be fair, not all of the material in Ms. Wasserstein's
book is quite this dippy. Anyone who has seen one of her
plays or read an interview with her knows she is earnest,
intelligent and likable -- and these qualities are partly
visible through the hairspray-misted air of "Bachelor Girls."
There even are a few serious meditations on babies vs.
career, AIDS, and women politicians. But most of the articles
are as lightweight as summer pajamas, and, read one after the
other, their cozy confidentiality is numbing. One of the
chief delights of occasional journalism ought to be the fact
that you only have to read it occasionally.
   Chances are anyone who caught one of Ms. Wasserstein's
articles in its original form was leafing through magazines
at a beauty parlor. Unlikely as it seems, this venerable
institution now is a breeding ground for fiction writers.
Sarah Gilbert, a graduate of Farah's Beauty School and winner
of its "Most Perms in a Month" award, has written a novel
devoted entirely to the lives of small-town beauticians. As
Ms. Gilbert noted in a press release, "It didn't take a
genius to see that my background was absolutely perfect for
writing fiction. . . . I'm just as proud of my beauty license
as I am of my Master's Degree in English."
   Ms. Gilbert's novel, ingeniously entitled "Hairdo"
(Warner, 243 pages, $17.95), is a madcap Southern burlesque,
a cross between "A Confederacy of Dunces" and the play "Steel
Magnolias." It features Miss Ruby McSwain, proprietress of
The Celebrity Styling Shop in Stuckey, S.C., who dreams of
winning first prize at the Southeast Hair Show in Atlanta,
"the Olympics of hair." Her employees range from Yvonne
Tisdale, a bible-thumping beautician in space shoes, to blond
Ronder Jeffcoat, who's been relegated to giving bikini waxes
in the back room.
   "Hairdo" is awash in Dippity-Do and Happy Hair, perming
solution and mousse. All kinds of insider knowledge is on
display here, including the intricacies of the finger wave,
the petal curl and something called an updo. There also is an
unkind caricature of a homosexual "hair designer" named
Thurston who wears a pink lab coat and makes declarations
such as, "I can't breathe when I'm around paisley" (Wendy
Wasserstein, take note). Despite this bit of down-home
Southern prejudice, "Hairdo" has a weird, sunny energy and a
lot of style.
   One person who undoubtedly would be outraged by Ms.
Gilbert's portrait of the prancing Thurston is Sarah
Schulman, the gay-rights activist whose 1988 offbeat murder
story, "After Delores," had its amusing moments. Ms.
Schulman's latest novel, though, "People in Trouble" (Dutton,
228 pages, $17.95), is a mostly grim piece of propaganda
disguised as a love story between Kate, a married artist in
her 40s, and Molly, a possessive younger woman.
   There are some vivid descriptions of squalid summers in
downtown New York, but "People in Trouble" otherwise is just
a litany of pronouncements about the horrors of AIDS, the
homeless, urban development, homophobia and middle-class
apathy. This kind of editorializing, when unconvincingly
dolled up as fiction, is more likely to elicit indifference
than outrage. At the very least it makes you want to call up
Wendy Wasserstein and discuss facials.

   NEW YORK -- Asarco Inc. first-quarter net income fell 48%
on a 16% decline in sales, primarily because of lower prices
for copper, zinc and silver.
   The nonferrous metals company, which also has interests in
specialty chemicals, said net fell to $35.8 million, or 86
cents a share, from $68.6 million, or $1.63 a share, a year
earlier. The average price for copper was $1.14 a pound in
the quarter, compared with $1.42 a year ago. Copper sales
accounted for about 57% of Asarco's total sales in 1989. Lead
prices and volume, however, were higher in the quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said earnings also were affected by higher
interest expense on debt incurred and excess cash used to
fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and stock
repurchases. Capital expenditures rose to $43.3 million from
$23.6 million in the year-earlier quarter.
   Sales fell to $521.2 million from $618.2 million.
   Results were within expectations, given the lower metals
prices, said Richard de J. Osborne, Asarco chairman,
president and chief executive officer. Mr. Osborne said
demand for copper, zinc and lead strengthened significantly
in March. He said supplies of those metals are tight, and the
outlook for demand is good.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Asarco closed at $25.625, down 50 cents.

   BLOOMFIELD, Conn. -- Amanda Solloway is a bit nervous as
she takes the "author's chair" in front of her class to read
a draft of "Ralph and Baseball," a story she has written
about a boy who conquers his fear of playing games on Friday
the 13th. When she finishes, a classmate questions her about
a detail in the story. Another makes a point about the plot.
A writing coach recommends some revisions.
   Amanda is in the third grade.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such elaborate analysis grew out of a determined effort in
Connecticut to zero in on where schools are failing and make
officials bring them up to snuff. Thanks to statewide tests,
school officials in this Hartford suburb found out four years
ago that their fourth and sixth graders were well below the
average in writing. Acting on this, they pushed a program
called "process writing," focusing on organization and
revision. At Metacomet Elementary School here, large signs on
the walls list the steps: pre-writing, drafting, revising,
editing and publishing.
   It seems to be helping. "In the past, you told kids to
write an essay, and either they could or they couldn't," says
Portia Mendez, Metacomet's principal. "Now they know how to
begin. If you tell them to write about their vacation, they
write the word `vacation' and then start putting down their
other thoughts -- television, playground, New York -- and
they can weave a story around them."
   The Connecticut plan has blazed a trail that educators and
politicians from President Bush down are now starting to
follow in a national effort to enhance education. The idea is
to set statewide goals and make school officials accountable
for results.
   The approach is somewhat unusual. In the U.S., education
has long been primarily a local responsibility. Although most
American students take a battery of standardized tests, there
isn't enough uniformity to give a coherent picture of where
schools are improving. And the U.S., unlike most other
industrial nations, has no national standards, no national
graduation tests and no national courses.
   Connecticut decided seven years ago to try standards on a
statewide basis. To begin, "We asked a very simple question:
What skills should we ask children to master?" explains
Gerald Tirozzi, the state's commissioner of education.
   Committees of teachers drafted grade-level achievement
goals. Then they devised tests to measure how well each
student, class, school and district was reaching the
objectives. The Connecticut Mastery Test was born. Now, every
October, all fourth, sixth and eighth graders in the state
take the test, which measures their competence in the Three
R's, reading, writing and arithmetic.
   The heart of it is a 45-minute writing exercise. An exam
for sixth graders last fall asked them to "pretend you could
live anywhere in the world. . . . Write a composition about
this place."
   Multiple-choice tests in math measure computational and
problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to interpret
data from graphs and charts. A reading test measures
comprehension and such higher-order skills as the ability to
draw inferences.
   Each December, school officials get detailed scores on
each child. Parents also get a report. In January,
school-district results "are published on the front page of
every newspaper in the state, and if a superintendent wants
to keep his job, he'd better make sure his schools do well,"
says Paul Copes, Bloomfield's superintendent of schools.
   The net result is to make school officials more
accountable for the progress of students than in the past.
Mr. Copes calls the tests "a public report card" that has
made it possible for voters and parents to see how Bloomfield
schools stack up against others in the state. Mary Eberle,
the chairwoman of Bloomfield's board of education, says that
in the early years, the tests were "instrumental in showing
the teachers that they weren't doing the job" and helping
teachers and administrators focus on ways to improve
teaching.
   Some educational critics complain that U.S. public schools
already inflict too many standardized tests on their
students, and that teachers, under pressure to show
improvement, "teach to the test." School officials here in
Bloomfield don't think so. "The mastery tests measure
life-long skills -- how to write, how to approach a problem,
how to estimate a solution," Mr. Copes contends. "You can't
do well on the test by rote memory."
   The concept of accountability is gaining support,
especially as other reforms fail to produce results. Over the
past decade, most states have focused their improvement
efforts on requirements, spending, resources, and tightening
graduation standards. Yet scores on standardized tests remain
low and employers complain that high-school graduates can't
read and reason well enough to be skilled workers.
   Here in Connecticut, Mr. Copes took over a district that
the state, through its testing, had just named one of the 20
weakest. In 1986, Bloomfield fell below the state average on
seven of the nine tests (three each for three grades).
   Last year, it was below the average on just three tests.
Like a Japanese factory, Bloomfield has lifted school
performance by responding to test results with relentless
attention to detail. "We have made adjustments in what we
teach and how we teach it," Mr. Copes says. "When I look at
the scores, I want to know if this is a system problem, a
school problem or a teacher problem. If it's a system
problem, it's probably the curriculum. If it's a school
problem, it may be leadership. If it's a classroom problem,
it may be an instructional" deficiency, he says.
   When performance on the sixth-grade writing test fell
sharply after three years of steady improvement, "upon review
we found some areas we could improve upon," the
superintendent continues. "The frequency of writing, the
monitoring of writing folders and the variety of writing
wasn't what we thought it should be." Hence the writing
program that has third graders elaborately analyzing one
another's writing.
   The attention Bloomfield teachers pay to writing is
unusual. In a recent nationwide survey, only 61% of 11th
graders said their teachers routinely mark mistakes on what
they write, while only 31% said their teachers commonly point
out what is well done. Possibly as a result, the survey found
that only 28% of 11th-graders could write an adequate letter
to a senator supporting a position on the space program.
   At Bloomfield, fine-tuning occurs in other subjects too.
"In math we developed a skill card for each grade level,"
says Mary Smith, assistant superintendent. "There are
required objectives that teachers have to cover every marking
period. It keeps a teacher from going over and over the same
topic for too long." The tests pinpoint students who need
extra help, which is required by the state for those who fall
below a certain level.
   Since the testing began, performance across Connecticut
has improved slowly but steadily. When the first group of
fourth graders took the tests in 1985, only 58.6% scored
above the remedial standard on all three tests: math,
language arts (which includes writing) and reading. Last
year, 65% scored above the remedial standard on all three
tests.
   Bloomfield has shown progress too. In 1985, when only
fourth graders took the tests, 39% of those in Bloomfield
needed remedial work in reading. By last fall, when these
children were in eighth grade, just 19% needed remedial work.
Math and writing have improved as well. "I'm looking to the
day when there are no remedial classes in the high school,"
Mr. Copes says.
   As a black superintendent in a district where 75% of the
students are black, he says he has another incentive: "The
challenge is to demonstrate that something largely minority
can be excellent."
   In its improvement drive, Bloomfield changed some of the
ways its schools operate. Elementary schools eliminated a
recess and reduced the number of times children move from one
room to another, such as the music room, thus adding 45
minutes a day to time available for teaching. Principals got
more authority over their teaching staffs and instruction
programs.
   Teachers now closely check homework performance, and
students who fall behind must complete their work during
special periods, sometimes on Saturday mornings. Mrs. Eberle,
the board of education chairwoman, says she learned that the
policy was having an impact when a student asked her to sign
a petition protesting longer homework assignments. (She
refused.) Parents of fourth graders and younger are asked to
read to their children 10 minutes a night.
   The schools monitor teacher performance more carefully and
hold more after-school meetings to discuss curriculum and
techniques. "The teachers have been required to do a
tremendous amount of extra work," says Raymond Froscio,
president of the local teachers' union, which is affiliated
with the National Education Association. Vaughn Ranseur, vice
principal in the high school, says that because of the
increased accountability, managers in the system face
"greater stress."
   But the unions and managers generally support the program.
One reason is that to compensate for the added effort,
Connecticut has lifted the average teacher salaries 41% since
1986, to $41,600 a year. The union's Mr. Froscio thinks it's
reasonable for school districts to expect greater
accountability as salaries rise.
   A growing number of educators see value in the concepts of
accountability and testing. "We have lots of tests, but we
really don't have any norms," notes Chester E. Finn Jr.,
chairman of the National Assessment Government Board, which
runs the federally funded National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP is the outfit that issues highly publicized
reports on how little students know). "Hence," he says, "we
have no clear sense of the result we seek from the efforts we
are making at school reform, or how good would be good
enough."
   Critics who question the value of standardized tests say
they raise the chances that national standards will be
imposed on local schools. Beverly Greenberg, a member of the
Connecticut board of education, worries that even the state
tests compromise local control, while overlooking important
differences. "I don't think every community is the same, and
I don't think every kid's needs are the same. I worry that
standardization will make everybody the same shade of gray,"
she says. But she concedes that the tests "have pushed
communities to improve basic skills.'
   Initially, some superintendents and school boards resisted
the larger state role, but the state board of education used
an open, public process in formulating achievement goals and
designing tests that made sense to the teachers. "Most of us
believe they are among the best tests in the country," says
Edward Reidy, the instructional director in the West Hartford
school system. Besides fourth, sixth and eighth graders, the
state is considering testing 10th graders.
   After establishing the mastery test system, Connecticut
also drafted a broad outline, called the Common Core of
Learning, of what it expects students to be able to do when
they complete high school. The standards are broad enough to
avoid being mistaken for a state curriculum.
   "We need a more common set of standards in this country,"
Mr. Reidy argues. "We don't want to lose local flavor or
control. But the fact is that our kids compete with kids from
all over the world, not just from Hartford."

   Barriers Dividing North, South Koreans
   Melt a Bit at Unique Moscow Restaurant

   MOSCOW -- It's a typical Sunday afternoon at the Pyongyang
Restaurant in downtown Moscow.
   North Korean diplomats and South Korean businessmen rub
elbows and exchange pleasantries. The founder of the martial
art tae kwon do, Choi Hong Hi, a former South Korean army
general accused by Seoul of defecting to the North 14 years
ago, trades friendly chatter with both sides. Russian waiters
in tuxedos serve students from the communist North and
visiting tycoons from the anticommunist South.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While official negotiations aimed at ending four decades
of hostility between the two countries routinely explode in
accusations and threats, Koreans from both sides manage to
meet and eat together civilly in the land of glasnost. For
both northerners and southerners, who haven't been allowed
since the early 1950s to so much as exchange letters across
the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean peninsula, the
attractions are kimchi (pickled cabbage), noodles and rice
wine.
   The restaurant is the brainchild of the state-run Moscow
Restaurant Service, which also has brought Baskin-Robbins and
McDonald's to the Soviet capital. "Our customers are foreign
tourists, Russians, South Korean businessmen and North Korean
Embassy people," says Gyenadi Krasnikov, who co-manages the
Pyongyang with a North Korean official. "There is no problem
with the Koreans. Here they are like friends."
   The restaurant opened in September as an equally owned
joint venture between the Soviet company and a North Korean
concern called Rina. Mr. Krasinov says the initial investment
figure is a "business secret." But Ri Chae Ho, one of 10
Koreans sent from the North to staff the restaurant, says
Pyongyang invested about 400,000 rubles ($659,000) in the
operation.
   The drab exterior, typical of shops and restaurants in the
Soviet Union, hides a nicely appointed interior with
carved-wood furniture in one room and long communal tables in
another. To the jarring mix of Russian rock music and
revolutionary North Korean songs, diners wash down a typical
feast of beef ribs, tofu, chicken and nuts, bean sprouts and
the essential varieties of kimchi with Pepsi-Cola and North
Korean vodka for 70 rubles a head.
   Gong Ro Myung, head of the South Korean consular office in
Moscow and the highest-ranking Seoul official in the Soviet
Union, doesn't eat at the Pyongyang, "because the food isn't
very good," he says. "It's very crude."
   There is "no diplomatic reason" for staying away, he
insists. "I'm telling many people that the fact that
South-North relations {are} taking place like this in Moscow
is very positive," he says. "If Mr. Soh {Soh Song Pil, the
new North Korean ambassador to the Soviet Union} invites me,
I'd be glad to go there myself."
   Sung Jung Hyun, director-general of the Moscow office of
the South's Korea Trade Promotion Corp., says he eats at the
Pyongyang regularly but reluctantly. "The quality of the food
and service is very bad," he says. "But if I want Korean food
-- and all Koreans want Korean food -- I have no choice."
   South Korean businessmen apparently are less fussy. "In
the seven months since we opened, around 1,200 South Korean
businessmen have visited," says Mr. Ri.
   This past Sunday found Hyundai business group founder
Chung Ju Yung as the host to a luncheon for company
executives in a private room. The tycoon flew in earlier this
month to seal a $6 billion petrochemical deal and a Siberian
lumber project.
   In an adjacent room, a group of North Korean Embassy
officials, all sporting lapel badges of their country's
"Great Leader" Kim Il Sung, lunched with their families. At a
nearby table, Mr. Choi, president of the World Tae Kwon Do
Federation, entertained Russian and Korean martial-arts
officials. A founding general of the South Korean army and
former ambassador to Malaysia, Mr. Choi fell afoul of
President Park Chung Hee in the 1970s, fled to Canada and was
branded a defector by successive Seoul governments.
   "I did not defect. I am a nationalist. We Koreans want
unification, and here in the restaurant," he said, surveying
the room, "you can see unification."
   On his way out, Hyundai's Mr. Chung stopped to chat
briefly with Mr. Choi. Their conversation immediately turned
to hopes for unification. Mr. Choi praised the Hyundai
executive's unprecedented visit to North Korea last year to
try to engineer a business breakthrough.
   "I'm glad you're working for the benefit of unification,"
Mr. Choi said. "Our generation should accomplish
unification."
   Mr. Chung agreed, but the North Korean-born self-made man,
whose conglomerate has annual sales rivaling the North's
gross national product, parted with a more down-to-earth
request of the Toronto-based Mr. Choi: "Please help us sell
more Hyundai cars in Canada."

   MOMMY TRACKING doesn't have to hurt careers, a long-term
look suggests.
   Taking time off from a job to raise a family "doesn't
appear to have had a major impact on final earnings" of women
who graduated from college 45 years ago, says Edith Fierst, a
Washington lawyer who surveyed the experiences of classmates
from the Barnard College Class of 1945. "Those within a given
occupation tended to end up in the same bracket whether or
not they had taken time off for children," she declares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of 75 class members who responded -- a third of the class
-- almost all had married and borne children, and most had
spent 10 to 15 years at home or in part-time jobs while their
families were young. Yet, Ms. Fierst says, of 11 graduates
earning more than $50,000 a year, seven had taken substantial
career breaks, as had most of those earning $25,000 to
$50,000 a year.
   Only 5% of the mommy trackers wished they had returned to
their careers earlier. One regretted a break.
                                                                                                       

   SUMMER INTERNSHIPS flourish, with emphasis on minorities.
   Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., which started bringing students aboard
for a summer's exposure only three years ago, expects to hire
25 this year, up from seven in 1989. It taps minority M.B.A.
candidates, undergrads and talented high schoolers. Chevron
Corp.'s hiring will increase to 350 from 320, with most going
into engineering, computer science and accounting. Special
scholarships are set aside to lure minorities. Texaco Inc.,
among its interns, looks to hire four African students
attending U.S. universities.
   Corning Inc., which will be hiring 90 interns this summer,
focuses on women and blacks because they "have been leaving
the company twice as fast as white males." Aluminum Co. of
America seeks women and minorities with engineering and
technical training, explaining that women and minorities
"don't gravitate" to these disciplines and those that do
should get "the encouragement internships can provide."
                                                                                                       

   FIRING BAD WORKERS can drag on, managers say. Mercy or
fear of suits?
   Half the workers surveyed by consultant Wyatt Co.
complained that "poor performance is tolerated too long in my
company." Now managers say they agree. Observes Henry Nozko,
president of Acmat Corp.: that's "1,000%" on target. A
shortage of workers and fear of litigation make management
"more tolerant," he declares. Last year, he recalls, it took
three months to discharge a "boozing" worker who years back
"would have been fired on the spot."
   But Coastal Corp. argues that "letting someone go is easy;
turning someone around is more of a challenge." Managers tend
to give workers extra ground out of compassion and a
reluctance to get involved in a hostile confrontation, a
spokesman explains. Tasty Baking Co. says it follows a
four-step procedure before firing anyone, which it equates to
a "death penalty."
   "Managers are more sensitive to human issues, and that's
great," one retail executive asserts.
                                                                                                       

   STOCK OWNERSHIP revisited. A survey of 774 publicly traded
firms turns up only 9% that encourage managers to own the
company's stock and a bare 1% that require it, consultant
William M. Mercer Inc. finds.
                                                                                                       

   MIDDLE-MANAGER rebound? Fired managers took 3.1 months to
find a job in the first quarter, down from 3.3 months in
1989's final quarter, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas says.
                                                                                                       

   SECRETARIES AND CLERKS represented by unions earn $56 a
week more than their nonunion counterparts, says a study for
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees.
                                                                                                       

   MULTIEMPLOYER pension plans remain secure. Consultant
Martin E. Segal Co. says the plans had assets last year to
cover on average 96% of vested benefits. Three-quarters of
them were fully funded.
                                                                                                       

   BUT FOR THREE DAYS . . . A widow loses $100,000 in
benefits.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, reversing a lower
court, says Delvina Lorenzen is entitled to only $89,000 in
death benefits from Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., rather than the
$192,000 lump sum her husband, Warren, had elected to receive
had he lived until his retirement, in three more days. Or
retired five months earlier, at age 65, as he had been
planning until the company asked him to stay to complete a
project. Or if Mrs. Lorenzen hadn't agreed, three days short
of his retirement, to remove him from life-support equipment
after he suffered his second cardiac arrest in two weeks.
   "The equities are not all on one side, however," the court
held, adding, "they rarely are; the tension between formal
justice and substantive justice is often, and perhaps here,
illusory." Life-support equipment "should not be used to
secure retirement benefits," and the cost could have been
considerable, it stated. Moreover, by postponing his
retirement, Mr. Lorenzen continued to draw full salary and
slightly increased his expected retirement benefit.
   "A gamble is not unfair merely because the gambler loses,"
the appeals court said in a 3-to-1 decision.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Thin Line] Executives must work 53 hours a
week to win promotions but burn out at 62 hours a week,
members of the National Association of Executive Recruiters
say. . . . Thin Line II] Hiring executives contend they are
influenced by an applicant's appearance but aren't swayed by
an applicant's attractiveness, consultant Transition Team
finds.

   DALLAS -- Lomas &amp; Nettleton Mortgage Investors, citing a
rocky real estate climate, said it nearly tripled its
loan-loss reserves to $50.6 million, leading to a net loss of
$35 million, or $2.99 a share, in the fiscal third quarter.
   The real estate investment trust also said that while it
plans to make a third-quarter dividend payment of 21 cents a
share, it will forgo a payment in August and "defer
consideration of further dividend payments until October
1990."

   "The deterioration of the country's real estate markets
has accelerated in recent months, and liquidity available to
the real estate industry appears to be at its lowest point
since the end of World War II," said Jess Hay, Lomas &amp;
Nettleton's chairman and chief executive.
   The third-quarter loss provisions included a special $37.5
million addition to aggregate reserves and a regular $500,000
quarterly provision for possible losses, the trust said.
Reserves currently stand at 6.5% of total investments, the
highest level in the trust's 20-year history.
   Revenue for the third quarter ended March 31 fell to $21.9
million from $34.1 million in the year-earlier quarter, when
Lomas &amp; Nettleton reported net income of $6.3 million, or 54

   Asian Countries
   Said to `Dump'
   Sweaters in U.S.

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department ruled that more than
$1 billion in annual imports of synthetic-fiber sweaters from
three Asian countries is being sold in the U.S. at unfairly
low prices.
   The preliminary finding, if upheld by the department,
could lead to the imposition of anti-dumping duties on the
imports. For that to happen, the U.S. International Trade
Commission would have to find, in a separate inquiry, that
the imports are injuring a domestic industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its ruling, the Commerce Department provisionally
recommended duties as high as 37% on the Taiwanese sweaters,
but much lower ones on those from South Korea and Hong Kong.
Dumping is defined as selling in another country at below the
home-market price or the cost of production. Anti-dumping
duties are intended to offset the unfair price advantages.
   U.S. merchants were somewhat relieved that the department
didn't set the possible penalty duties as high as recommended
by the National Knitwear &amp; Sportswear Association, which
petitioned for the anti-dumping investigation.
   But the merchants were concerned about the ruling's
potential impact on rules governing the international textile
trade. The U.S. has negotiated import limits with most of its
major foreign textile suppliers since the mid-1970s. During
that period, it rarely has initiated anti-dumping actions
against them.
   "We are raising the question of double jeopardy," said
Martin Lewin, an attorney for the U.S. Association of
Importers of Textiles and Apparel, which represents many of
the major department-store chains and retail outlets. "Those
countries already are under import quotas. It wouldn't be
fair to impose anti-dumping duties on them as well."
   The Commerce Department insists that it's acting in accord
with the Multifiber Arrangement, the umbrella pact covering
the textile trade. "There's nothing in the MFA that would
prevent the U.S. government from conducting this
investigation," a department spokeswoman said.
   The Hong Kong government said it will question the U.S.
action in the current round of trade talks conducted under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "In the free
economy of Hong Kong, we don't dump," asserted P. C. Leung,
Hong Kong's Washington-based trade counselor. "There's no
reason for us to sell at a loss; it would be easier for us to
put money in a bank and earn interest."
   Taiwan, the largest of the three suppliers, could suffer
serious losses in the U.S. market if the duties are imposed.
The ruling set a margin of 36.89% on shipments from four
Taiwanese firms and a margin of 25.2% on products of several
others. The value of Taiwan's shipments of sweaters to the
U.S. last year was $485.5 million.
   The margins found for sweaters from Hong Kong range from
0.01% to 12.02%, and those for the South Korean shipments,
with a few exceptions, were slight. But the mere fact that
these products are under investigation creates some
"uncertainty in the market," Mr. Lewin said. Last year,
sweater shipments from South Korea and Hong Kong totaled an
estimated $476.1 million and $208.8 million, respectively.
   A final determination on the knitwear association's
complaint is due July 5.

   In regard to David Asman's interview with Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, on your April 4
editorial page: The Mexico-United States Institute is happy
that Mr. Salinas now seems to favor a closer trade
relationship with the U.S., and perhaps even a North American
Common Market. We have advocated both all along.
   Of course, Mr. Salinas is right when he complains that he
has opened Mexico's economy wide to foreign products, and
that the U.S. and other foreign countries have not
reciprocated. But when he claims that the opening "has meant
lower prices for Mexicans" and has reduced inflation, he is
on uncertain ground.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If Mexicans are paying less for some items, and inflation
is under 20% -- still a lot higher than the U.S. rate -- that
is because of the economic pact he and his predecessor have
imposed on labor and management that freezes wages and
manufacturing prices. Only when prices are permitted to find
their own level in the marketplace will we learn how low, or
high, they really are, and consequently the true rate of
inflation. But after more than two years, there is no sign
that the Mexican government is ready to trust the open market
-- a different animal from Mr. Salinas's "open economy."
   Further, he boasts that he has "forced domestic producers"
to cut their prices to international levels but does not
mention that move has, in turn, forced them to cut back on
production, as their profit margins have correspondingly
fallen. In the end the fall guy is the worker, whose services
no shrunken enterprise needs or can afford.
   Though one can only praise Mr. Salinas's advocacy of
privatization, publicity has outstripped performance. The
privatizations he has effectuated still leave intact the
state-owned "strategic" enterprise -- soil, petrochemicals,
banking, electric power, satellite communications, railroads,
and so on -- that represent an estimated 75% to 80% of the
state's assets in the economy and constitute the industrial
infrastructure. Until most of them, at least, are privatized,
Mexico's economy will not be free.
   We wonder why Mr. Asman's interview was confined to
economic affairs. After all, without political freedom and
democracy, economic freedom will be found wanting. As the
democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe and Nicaragua
dramatically underscore, unless a government is accountable
to the people it will commit excesses that inevitably drive
national economies into the ground. Mr. Salinas's
predecessors did just that in Mexico.
   Unfortunately, as the heir to the world's second-oldest
one-party state, after the Soviet Union, Mr. Salinas also is
not accountable; hence he takes only half-measures in trying
to modernize Mexico. There is still time, but not much, for
him to do what the Poles and Hungarians are doing, and
presumably the new Nicaraguan government will do: Go all-out
for a free economy and free political system.

   HARTFORD, Conn. -- In the wake of the company's report
that first-quarter profit rose nearly 9%, United Technologies
Corp. Chairman Robert F. Daniell said he's confident the
earnings growth will continue.
   Addressing the company's annual meeting, Mr. Daniell
attributed the growth to corporatewide, cost-cutting efforts
that "will bear fruit for years to come." He cited the Pratt
&amp; Whitney jet engine division's plan to trim costs as much as
30% by 1992 as "emblematic of these efforts."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earnings climbed to $134.5 million, or $1.05 a share, from
$123.7 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
increased to $4.8 billion from $4.46 billion.
   Mr. Daniell said a three-year working capital reduction
program, which is in place, is expected to save $1 billion by
1991. "In 1989, the first year of the program, we reduced the
absolute level of working capital tied up in our businesses
by about $350 million, even as revenue rose 7%," he said.
"New opportunities for us on the commercial side in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union can more than make up for any
slack caused by reductions in the defense budget."
   He said the company will continue to invest in research
and development. It has done a better job of transferring and
applying aerospace and defense technology to its commercial
and industrial businesses, Mr. Daniell said. The company's
businesses include building systems, automotive products and
aerospace.

   IRS Reluctant
   To Give Its Nod
   For New Bond

   WASHINGTON -- Not so fast.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission last week took a
major step to open up the capital markets. But the Internal
Revenue Service may be reluctant to loosen a tax regulation
that some investors say still thwarts free global trade in
debt securities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This week the IRS will decide whether to permit a
newfangled bond that proponents say would complement the
spirit of the SEC's new Rule 144a by boosting
securities-market liquidity.
   In conversations with Wall Street tax lawyers, IRS and
Treasury officials have indicated they are reluctant to allow
the new bond, which would bridge the gap between the
different species of bonds sold in the U.S. and Europe.
   In 1982 Congress effectively eliminated the sale of bearer
bonds -- bonds that aren't registered in the name of the
holder -- to U.S. institutions or citizens. The worry was
that if securities couldn't be linked to their holder, the
holder might not pay taxes on the interest income.
   But the European market deals primarily in bearer debt. So
last summer the IRS asked for public comment on the idea of
allowing bonds that can be converted from non-bearer to
bearer form, so U.S. holders could easily trade securities
with Europeans and vice versa.
   The IRS was anticipating SEC enactment of Rule 144a, which
allows big investors to trade certain securities without
complying with U.S. reporting requirements. The new rule is
aimed at increasing liquidity in U.S. capital markets and
opening those markets to foreign companies, which have shied
away because of U.S. reporting requirements.
   If the IRS doesn't allow the convertible bond, "it will
tend to make the markets less efficient for foreign issuers
who are trying to use 144a," said Leslie Samuels, a partner
at the law firm Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton in New
York. For example, he said, a foreign company would have to
pay a higher rate on its debt to attract a U.S. buyer because
the U.S. buyer would have trouble reselling the debt in the
European-bearer market.
   The new bond would "facilitate an easier trade," said Jon
Moldafsky, vice president of Meritus, a Los Angeles firm that
provides credit ratings and analysis for privately sold
securities.
   Some investors say the new SEC rule is so attractive to
foreigners that the remaining tax restrictions shouldn't
matter much.
   "The Europeans really want to tap the U.S. market," said
Heiko Thieme, a New York-based consultant to Deutsche Bank of
West Germany.
   And others say that foreign investors have become more
accustomed to holding non-bearer debt in recent years --
especially as the U.S. has turned overseas to fund its budget
deficit with non-bearer Treasury securities. "I don't believe
a favorable {IRS} ruling will have a big effect on the
liquidity of 144a issues," said Kenneth Lay, senior manager
in financial operations at the World Bank. Mr. Lay said about
two-thirds of a $1.5 billion World Bank offering of
non-bearer debt last September was purchased by foreigners.
   IRS and Treasury officials won't disclose the position
they plan to take. But in response to claims that the ability
to take advantage of the new SEC rule would be limited if the
IRS doesn't allow the convertible bond, a Treasury tax
official said, "You can argue against that -- the fact that
U.S. Treasury securities are issued in registered
{non-bearer} form in the overseas markets without much
trouble. . . . If we are talking about people who aren't into
tax avoidance, the anonymity the bearer debt permits isn't an
important factor."

   GM Will Shut
   Truck-Making
   Michigan Plant

   Output to Be Switched in '93

   Currently Making Cars

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it expects to close a
Michigan assembly plant in 1993, the latest in a string of
closures designed to bring the auto maker's production
capacity in line with its sales.
   Production of the compact pickup trucks now built at the
plant will be moved to a plant in New Jersey that now builds
compact cars. So GM is reducing its car-making capacity,
which it has in excess, but keeping the same number of
truck-assembly plants, where its capacity roughly equals
demand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest announcement of a plant closing comes just as
GM heads into contract talks with the United Auto Workers.
Union officials, already angry over earlier plant shutdowns,
have promised to make job security a top issue in
negotiations this summer. "It's hard to see how greater
efficiency and higher worker morale can result from GM's
continuing game of musical chairs with the lives of our
members and their families," said Stephen P. Yokich, who
heads the UAW's General Motors department.
   Since 1988, GM has closed three car-assembly plants, and
it plans to idle another one later this year. In addition,
the No. 1 auto maker now has converted or plans to convert
three car plants into truck plants. Even after GM cranks up
production at its new Saturn car plant, the net reduction in
car capacity will be equivalent to six plants. Clearly, GM is
pushing to keep its often-stated promise to be using 100% of
its North American vehicle-building capacity by 1992.
   The loser in yesterday's move was GM's Pontiac West
assembly plant in Pontiac, Mich., which expects to "cease
production" of compact pickup trucks at the end of 1993. The
plant employs 2,000 hourly workers.
   GM's plant in Linden, N.J., will stop building Chevrolet
Corsica and Beretta cars in September 1991 and then retool
for compact pickup trucks. The Linden plant will begin
building trucks in the fall of 1992, a GM spokeswoman said.
Linden currently employs 1,800 hourly workers on just one
shift because of sluggish sales of the cars it builds. The
plant should employ about 2,600 after it switches over to
trucks, said Charlie L. Marshall, president of the UAW local
that represents the Linden plant.
   "With this announcement came a lot of relief for a lot of
people" at the Linden plant, Mr. Marshall said.
   Linden was chosen to build compact trucks because it is a
larger, more flexible plant than Pontiac West, a GM
spokeswoman said. Linden has 2.5 million square feet of
enclosed space, compared with 1.8 million in Pontiac West.
Also, GM spent $130 million in 1987 to install at Linden a
modern "clear-coat" paint shop, which Pontiac West lacks.
   The Pontiac West plant is represented by a militant union
local, headed by members of the New Directions movement that
opposes close cooperation with management. "We're not into
the team concept," said Ron Miller, vice president of UAW
Local 594.
   A GM spokeswoman replied, "We look at a number of things;
labor relations would be one of them." But she added, "It
would be difficult to separate one issue out and say the
decision was made on one thing."
   Mr. Miller predicted that GM would pick Pontiac West to
assemble another model after it stops building compact pickup
trucks there in 1993. But the GM spokeswoman said the car
maker currently has "no other product" planned for Pontiac
West.
   In connection with the changes at Linden and Pontiac, GM
said, it is developing the flexibility at its two assembly
plants in Lansing, Mich., to build either the Beretta or
Corsica. Those plants currently build three other compact
cars, the Pontiac Grand Am, the Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais and
the Buick Skylark.
   All five models, though, are about the same size, and are
expected to be consolidated in the early-to-mid 1990s as part
of GM's continuing cost-reduction effort. "This fits into our
overall strategy at the Lansing Automotive Division of being
able to produce all of these small cars and use (common)
components within them," the company spokeswoman said.

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal
by General Motors Corp., which was seeking to kill a
warranty-related lawsuit that may become a class action for
nearly 600,000 purchasers of 1981-1985 cars and trucks with
5.7-liter diesel engines.
   The suit was filed by 183 purchasers of diesel-powered
vehicles for alleged violations of a federal law that
regulates warranties on consumer products. The purchasers,
who experienced problems with the engines, sued over the
company's failure to repair defects and challenged GM's
limits imposed on "implied" warranties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lawsuit hasn't been certified as a class action, yet.
The purchasers say that if a federal court recognizes the
case as a class action, there may be 596,364 persons making
claims against GM.
   "We're dissapointed that the Supreme Court declined to
review the court of appeals decision," a GM spokesman said.
"The Supreme Court decision is not a decision on the merits
of the case or that it can proceed with a class action. GM
intends to vigorously defend itself in this case."
   The dispute is over the so-called implied warranty of
merchantability. Motor vehicle makers provide buyers some
express, written warranties on parts. But most states also
have laws regulating sales that add an additional, implied
promise in consumer transactions that the merchandise is fit
for consumer use.
   Manufacturers may place limits on how long express
warranties last, such as 24 months or 24,000 miles. But the
GM purchasers sued over the company's effort to impose the
same limit on the duration of implied warranties.
   Before trial, a federal court dismissed the claims of 107
purchasers who said the problems with their vehicles began
after express warranties had expired.
   But a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., reinstated
the claims, ruling that the purchasers should be allowed to
offer evidence that applying the time limits of express
warranties to implied warranties is unfair to consumers.
   The high court, without comment, refused to hear GM's
appeal. (General Motors Corp. vs. Carlson)

   In other actions, the high court:
   -- Agreed to decide whether convicted criminals who didn't
object to having federal magistrates preside over jury
selection at their trials are now entitled to new trials
because of a Supreme Court ruling last year that magistrates
don't have the power to oversee jury selection. (U.S. vs.

   Bargain Hunters Lift Some Prices
   In the Resale Partnership Market

   Investors hunting for bargains are helping to boost prices
of some limited partnerships in the informal resale, or
"secondary" market.
   While prices of partnerships sponsored by troubled
syndicators continued to fall during the first quarter,
investors selling interests in some other partnerships got
prices that were a bit higher than in the last three months
of 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These are some of the findings of the latest Wall Street
Journal survey of trading at a number of small investment
firms that buy partnership interests from investors, either
for their own accounts or for resale to new investors. The
survey covers resale-market trading in 20 widely held
partnerships.
   The survey found that the best prices investors got when
selling real estate partnership units in 1990's first quarter
averaged about 35% below their original prices. The average
discount was about 41% in the previous quarter.
Secondary-market firms reported that investors in 10 of the
11 real estate partnerships in the survey sold partnership
units during the quarter; sales were reported in all 11 in
the last three months of 1989.
   All together, sales by investors were reported for 17 of
the 20 partnerships in the survey, compared with 15 in the
previous quarter. The best prices sellers got averaged 34%
below the original offering prices, about the same as in the
previous quarter.
   The partnerships in the survey are a small sample of the
nearly $90 billion of such investments sold publicly by major
Wall Street brokerage firms and other syndicators since the
late 1970s. About half invested in real estate or mortgages,
while the rest undertook everything from leasing jetliners
and computers to buying oil wells and cable-television
systems.
   Designed as long-term investments, partnerships typically
have lives of about 10 years before their assets are sold and
investors are paid off. But at least 20% of older
partnerships are foundering, according to brokerage-industry
estimates. The informal resale market is about the only
outlet for investors who want to get out before a partnership
runs its normal course.
   Disappointment over performance isn't the only reason some
investors sell. Some investors who got out in the first
quarter, just prior to the annual tax-filing deadline, did so
to make this the last year they had to face the chore of
reporting on their partnership investments to the Internal
Revenue Service, secondary-market brokers say.
   Every year, they must decipher a sponsor-supplied
"Schedule K-1 Partners' Share of Income, Credits, Deductions,
Etc." for their partnership. Deciding where and how to report
that information on their tax returns is often a
time-consuming process. Hiring a professional to do it can
easily add $400 a partnership to an investor's
tax-preparation expenses.
   Earlier this month, the Treasury Department and the IRS
asked Congress to simplify the chore by replacing the complex
K-1 with a streamlined Form 1099-K, similar to the form banks
and others use to report investors' dividends and interest.
The Investment Partnership Association, a Washington, D.C.,
trade group, helped develop the proposed form, which could be
used by partnerships with more than 100 partners.
   The secondary market also presents opportunities for
investors to get into many partnerships for substantially
less than the original offering price. Buying in the resale
market can be treacherous, however, especially for investors
looking for high current income.
   While many partnerships make periodic cash distributions
to investors, those payments typically aren't guaranteed.
Thus, yield estimates, which like those in the Journal survey
usually compare recent distributions and current resale
prices, can be illusory. There isn't any certainty that those
payouts will continue at the same rate. They could even stop
altogether.
   Sponsors of two partnerships in the Journal survey are
among several troubled syndicators considering possible
"roll-ups." In a roll-up, several limited partnerships are
combined into a new, publicly traded investment. The survey
partnerships that would be affected are Equitec Real Estate
Investors Fund XV and Prudential-Bache Energy Income Series
III 14.

   FRANKFURT -- Lufthansa German Airlines said that it and
three other major international airline companies have signed
a letter of intent to form a world-wide computer information
network for cargo handling and logistics support services.
   A new joint venture company is to be established in
Frankfurt to develop the information system and provide the
data, which initially will be limited to the cargo and
logistics support services offered by the individual airlines
involved in the venture, Lufthansa said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It will start by offering freight forwarders and trade
and industry direct access to in-house airline cargo computer
systems and will provide schedule information, cargo
reservation, tracking and {other} value-added services," the
airline said.
   A spokesman for the 51% state-owned West German airline
stressed that the new venture won't engage in cargo haulage
or logistics management-services itself, but rather serve as
a clearing house for data concerning the freight-handling
activities and services of the airlines involved.
   Initial Lufthansa partners will be Air France, Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific Airways and Japan Air Lines. Financial details
of the accord weren't disclosed, but Lufthansa said other air
carriers will be invited to join the venture.
   The agreement falls short of rumors last October of a
far-reaching linkup of air-freight operations by the
companies. At that time Japanese newspapers suggested
Lufthansa, Air France and JAL planned to combine not only
their cargo computers, but also their ground and air-cargo
systems.

   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. -- Cautious buyers and a troubled
junk-bond market continued to depress merger activity in the
first quarter.
   Mergers and acquisitions announced in the first quarter
were down 13% to 597 from 685 a year earlier, according to
W.T. Grimm &amp; Co., a unit of New York-based Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.'s Merrill Lynch Business Brokerage &amp; Valuation
subsidiary. The total value of transactions plummeted 38% to
$34.3 billion from $55 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The absence of megadeals greatly contributed to the sharp
drop in value, said Beth Rosencrans, research director of the
Merrill Lynch unit. The total value of the 10 largest deals
announced in the latest first quarter was $15.7 billion --
less than the $16.1 billion acquisition, announced last
April, of SmithKline Beckman Corp. by Beecham Group PLC. The
largest transaction announced in the 1990 first quarter was
the $4.4 billion bid for UAL Corp.
   The drop continued a downward trend that began late last
year, Ms. Rosencrans added. In the 1989 fourth quarter, the
number of deals fell 13% while the total value fell 11% from
a year earlier.
   The number of foreign concerns bidding for U.S. companies
rose 31% to 93 from 71 last year. Simultaneously, the dollar
value of those transactions climbed 65% to $12.9 billion from
$7.8 billion.

   Shooting Down Bison
   Is Anything but a `Hunt'

<LP>
   In regard to Ruth Rudner's April 3 Leisure &amp; Arts article
"Where the Buffalo Don't Roam": Permitting the shooting of
bison that wander outside the boundaries of Yellowstone Park
makes no more sense than declaring open season on animals
that escape from their cages at the zoo. Park officials'
claim of "keeping animals wild by allowing them natural
movement through their natural habitat" is ludicrous. Are
bears that live off garbage and wander up to tourists' cars
begging handouts natural? Yes, "population control has to
happen," but surely it can be accomplished more humanely.
   I saw scenes of the "hunt" on TV -- animal-rights
activists pleading to have a bleeding, struggling animal put
out of its misery while "hunters" stood about laughing,
prolonging the creature's terrible suffering because they got
a kick out of the effect it had on the activists. Even the
park rangers, condoning this behavior and chasing away those
who attempt to keep the animals within park boundaries, don't
behave like real rangers in Yellowstone.

   While Ms. Rudner's article did a fairly accurate job of
portraying a complex situation, attention should be brought
to a coloring of an important fact. Ms. Rudner states,
"Because {bison} can carry brucellosis, which causes cattle
to abort if they come into contact with the fresh afterbirth
of an aborted bison fetus, ranchers are understandably
concerned if bison cross the boundary."
   That sounds like reasonable justification for the hunt --
but the Humane Society says there isn't a case on record of
brucellosis being passed from wild bison to domestic cows.
The ranchers' stated reason for protection is actually
nothing more than a smoke screen to masquerade their true
motives -- to eliminate competition from increasingly scarce
grazing lands.
   It's time the public took notice of this travesty, and let
Congress know that it won't put up with the senseless
slaughter of an American treasure.

   The discussion of reserves with consignors is a perfectly
normal aspect of the art-auction business that has been
completely misrepresented to indicate a concern about the
market that simply does not exist. The confidence that we do
feel going forward into May was omitted from her report. For
the record, the quality of paintings in our May sales is
unparalleled, with excellent works that have not been on the
market for a long time. We are seeing world-wide interest in
these paintings, and have every expectation that the May
sales will be successful and that the art market will
continue its strong performance.

   Ad Revenue at Newspapers
   Expected to Be Flat in 1990

   LOS ANGELES -- Newspaper publishers will get more bad news
today about advertising spending in 1990.
   Craig Standen, president of the Newspaper Advertising
Bureau (NAB), is expected to report today at the American
Newspaper Publishers Association's annual meeting that the
rate of growth in advertising spending in the nation's
newspapers will remain flat in 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Standen, in the NAB's "state of the business" address,
blames the industry stall on lowered retail and classified ad
spending. Retail advertising, which is more than half of most
newspapers' revenues, has dropped as retail sales have
fallen. A slowed economy in most parts of the country has
also resulted in large drops in the level of classified
employment, real estate and automotive advertising.
Classified ads make up about 40% of newspaper ad revenues.
   Publishers were hoping for some good news after several
years of a declining growth rate and recent severe falloffs
in classified and retail ad spending. Mr. Standen is expected
to report, however, that should the economy strengthen, the
growth rate will increase to between 5% and 6% in 1991.
   Newspapers continue to be the largest advertising medium
in the U.S. -- larger than TV and magazines combined -- but
their growth has declined steadily from 9% in 1987, to 6% in
1988.

   Mexico's Stock Market Advances
   On Faith in Economic Programs

   MEXICO CITY -- From Tokyo to London, this has been a year
to forget in most world stock markets. Thirteen of the top 16
markets declined in the first quarter.
   But Mexico's stock market, known as the Bolsa de Valores,
has been a shining star amid the market gloom. So far this
year, the Bolsa's stock index is up nearly 25%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among the factors bolstering the $35 billion Mexican stock
market: Many investors believe that the best is yet to come
in the market-oriented economic program of Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   "Inflation is under control, and the president has set all
of the bases for sustained growth," says Gerardo Copca
Sanchez, an analyst at Casa de Bolsa Mexico, an investment
house. "Investors are eager to see what he does next and are
betting on even more significant reforms."
   In particular, two of the pillars of Mr. Salinas's plan to
revitalize the Mexican economy -- privatizing state-owned
companies and opening the country to more foreign investment
-- have helped set off the market's boom.
   Bank stocks have been buoyed by a surge of rumors --
strenuously disputed by the government -- that the
state-controlled banking system will soon be privatized. The
banks were nationalized in 1982 in a last-gasp move by
President Jose Lopez Portillo, whose mismanagement of the
economy was instrumental in turning Mexico's oil boom into a
debt bust. The relationship between the government and
private sector in Mexico has never been the same since the
nationalization, even though 34% of bank shares were
subsequently placed back in private hands.
   Mr. Salinas, who has overseen the sale or closing of some
700 state-owned companies over the past five years, recently
took a significant step toward giving private business people
more autonomy in investing in the bank sector. The government
eased rigid restrictions on the amount of bank stock an
individual investor can hold.
   Although officials have denied that the change is a
precursor to privatization, they haven't succeeded in damping
speculation that the government intends to get out of the
banking business. Rolando Vega, president of the Business
Coordinating Council, Mexico's most powerful business lobby,
told reporters last month that the reprivatization of the
bank was "very near."
   Whether that is so or not, there were sound technical
reasons for investors to take a look at bank stocks this
year. "Even without the rumors of privatization, its been a
good time to buy bank stocks because they started the year
greatly undervalued," says Moises Tiktin, an analyst at
Valores Finamex, a Mexican investment house. At the end of
last year, Mexican bank stocks were trading at 3.32 times
corporate earnings, compared with a P/E multiple of 8.02
times for non-financial stocks, according to Mr. Tiktin.
   The mix of privatization speculators and bargain hunters
has triggered lightning growth in bank stocks. Leading the
way were Banca Serfin S.A., which rose 78.6% in the first
quarter, Banco Internacional S.A., which was up 67.6%, and
Bancomer S.A., which rose 56.6%.
   Yet another factor in the Bolsa's boom has been the
arrival in force of foreign investors, who had long been all
but shut out of Mexico's market. In November, the government
opened a trust administered by the state development bank
that allows foreigners to buy into Mexico's publicly traded
companies. Since then, foreign investors have bought about
$350 million of the "certificates of participation," which
grant holders all the privileges of shareholders except
voting rights.
   Grupo Industrial Alfa S.A., a huge conglomerate that has
sharply reduced its debt and increased its exports, has
attracted the greatest interest from foreigners. Another
favorite has been the government's 56%-owned telephone
monopoly, Telefonos de Mexico, which the government has said
it intends to privatize later this year or early next.
   "If handled properly, the sale of Telmex is going to
really help put Mexico on the map for investors all over the
world," says Douglas Campbell, president of D.A. Campbell, a
Los Angeles investment firm that tracks international
telephone companies.

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission foresees a
struggle that could extend into 1991 in getting the 12 member
states to agree to EC-wide capital-adequacy rules for
securities firms, and is expected to unveil proposed rules
tomorrow.
   After consulting with the securities industry and much
compromising, the commission hopes the proposals will be
acceptable to West Germany and Britain, where the securities
markets' main players are specialized firms. In West Germany,
by contrast, universal banks combine banking, insurance,
securities trading and other financial services. The problem
is finding rules flexible enough to be fair to all. The
commission has revised its plans to meet many concerns of
British firms, which said the EC rules were too onerous, but
many smaller firms fear minimum-capital rules will drive them
out of business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The capital-adequacy rules are linked to a proposed EC
directive to let securities firms operate on an EC-wide
basis, as long as they are licensed to do business in one
member state. But West German banks fear this will allow
British firms to undercut the fees charged in West Germany,
because non-German firms won't be subject to the more onerous
capital requirements for banks. The commission proposal would
let banks' securities units fall under the same rules as
securities firms elsewhere in the EC. But West German banks
would still be subject to strict West German rules on
capital, and are expected to push for tougher overall rules
or protection from foreign competition.

   TOKYO -- The Finance Ministry has decided to require

is a change in major shareholders.
   Ministry officials said the securities houses, numbering
some 220, will be notified of the decision this week.
</LP>

   The step will be taken, one official said, in an effort to
"ensure the independence of securities companies," indicating
that the ministry is anxious to prevent unfriendly takeovers
just when the financial conditions of securities houses,
especially smaller ones, have been deteriorating as a result
of recent sharp declines in the Tokyo stock market.
   Specifically, officials said, the securities companies are
to report when someone acquires more than 5% of the
outstanding shares or when a shareholder who already owns
more than 5% buys or sells more than 1% of his shares.
   A report is to be filed when talks start in the case of
friendly share acquisitions or when a securities company
finds out about major shareholder changes in the case of
hostile purchases, according to officials.

   In Virginia Bank Merger Case, Top Court
   To Decide if Holders May Sue Over Proxy

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, in a Virginia bank merger
case, agreed to decide when a proxy statement may serve as
the basis for seeking damages under federal securities law.
   The justices must decide whether shareholders may sue a
company and its directors over an allegedly misleading proxy
statement, when the alleged misstatements couldn't have
affected the outcome of the proxy fight. The justices must
also decide whether a proxy statement must disclose all the
motives of directors who recommend a merger.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These two issues, although technical, have substantial
practical importance. The American Corporate Counsel
Association, a trade group for corporate general counsels,
said in a friend-of-the-court brief that many proxy disputes
are matters of state law and don't involve federal securities
law. As state-law issues, proxy disputes are subject to caps
on damages that many states have set for the liability of
individual directors. But when these cases are transformed
into federal-law disputes, the limits don't apply and
directors face greater potential liability.
   The high court agreed to hear an appeal by First American
Bankshares Inc., First American Bank of Virginia and its
directors in a dispute over a complicated merger. A First
American Bankshares unit, Virginia Bankshares Inc., which
already had an 85% interest in First American Bank of
Virginia, acquired the remaining 15% in 1987.
   According to Virginia law, the bank was required to
consult the holders of the remaining 15% before the merger
could be completed. The minority shareholders were informed
in a proxy statement of the merger at a $42-a-share price.
   The proxy statement said the $42 price was approved
because it was fair and in the best interests of
shareholders. The price was based on a review by an
investment adviser hired by First American Bankshares, the
proxy statement said.
   A minority shareholder, Doris Sandberg, sued for
violations of federal securities law and state law; she also
asked that the case be treated as a class action on behalf of
all minority shareholders.
   The lawsuit alleged that the proxy statement was
misleading because it failed to disclose that First American
Bank of Virginia's directors recommended approval of the
merger because they wanted to keep their positions and avoid
being replaced at the behest of First American Bankshares.
The holding concern is led by Chairman Clark Clifford, a
prominent Washington lawyer.
   The state-law claim was that the bank should have hired an
outside firm, and not have relied on First American
Bankshares' adviser.
   A federal court jury awarded Ms. Sandberg an additional
$18 a share, or $43,956, for the misleading proxy statement
under federal securities law, and for breach of fiduciary
duty under state law. But the judge refused to treat the case
as a class action. After the verdict, 69 other minority
holders filed an identical lawsuit and were awarded $18 a
share, or $3.3 million.
   Last December, a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va.,
upheld the two verdicts and ordered that the first lawsuit be
reopened as a class action, allowing other minority
shareholders to file claims. The appeals court rejected the
bank's argument that proxy lawsuits under federal law must
allege that the result of the merger fight would have been
different if there hadn't been misleading statements.
   The liability for the federal securities violations, the
federal court said, is shared by the companies and the bank's
directors, while the liability on the state-law claims is
only against the directors. On paper, the verdicts for the
federal-law and state-law claims are the same, with the
shareholders entitled to only one award or the other, but not
both.
   However, because Virginia, like many states, has placed a
$100,000 limit on a corporate director's individual
liability, sizable verdicts based on state law will almost
always be reduced. In the second of the two lawsuits, for
example, the 69 shareholders would select the federal-law
verdict of $3.3 million, because the damages would be limited
by the cap under the state-law claims to $2.3 million.
   If after hearing arguments in the fall, the high court
upholds the verdicts, the companies and the bank's directors
may face an additional $13 million in liability under federal
law from the class action.
   In their Supreme Court appeal, the companies and directors
argued that the appeals court decision "expands the scope of
federal proxy regulation" and turns "federal proxy law into
an insurance scheme for investors. . . ." (Virginia

   Lancaster Colony Corp., a consumer goods concern based in
Columbus, Ohio, said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, in
which holders will receive, as a dividend, one right for each
share of stock held at the close of business tomorrow.
   Under the plan, the rights may be exercised if an investor
acquires, without board approval, at least 15% of the
corporation's common stock or announces a tender offer that
would result in the investor's owning at least 30% of the
common. If the rights are exercised, holders will be able to
buy the company's common stock having a market value of $140
for $70. Such plans are designed to make unwanted takeover
bids prohibitively expensive.

   AST Courts a Market in Tokyo and a Break From Washington

<LP>
   IRVINE, Calif. -- AST Research Inc. is suddenly a hot
property in both DRAMs and diplomacy. In business 10 years,
America's ninth-largest computer maker has seen its stock
price double from where it started this year, on the basis of
a sharp bounce-back in earnings. And because of a bold
venture into Japan, the company has emerged as a trade token
-- the Motorola of the '90s, perhaps -- in the progressing
brinksmanship between the Pacific's economic giants.
   All of that makes Safi Qureshey, 38, AST's founding
president and CEO, a man whose take on developments in
Washington and Tokyo might offer some front-lines feedback.
It turns out that, politically, he seems to be a circuitry
mix.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Right now he's preoccupied with trying to get before
Japanese customers the personal computer AST has designed to
compete with that nation's dominant NEC line. After what Mr.
Qureshey says was an investment of $2 million over the past
two years, AST can sell a PC that matches NEC's
specifications (and is a little faster than AST's
three-year-old model on which this column is written) but is
also compatible with most American software. This, he says,
would allow Japanese users immediate access to 10 times the
program choices they'd otherwise have.
   AST says its problem is that Sharp Corp., the Japanese
giant that was to sell the American product under its name
and through its distribution channels, is balking. Having had
a look "at what we have done, maybe some people at Sharp are
saying `we can do it ourselves,' in which case, they have
wasted a lot of our time," Mr. Qureshey laments. (A Sharp
spokesman in the U.S. says its executives in Japan express
unawareness of such talks.)
   Mr. Qureshey thinks he may have less than a year's head
start left on the technology. So, after Stephen Kreider Yoder
broke the news of the line in the Journal on April 10, AST
held a press briefing in Tokyo to "broadcast a message" to
consumers and substitute partners there.
   The presence of a Commerce Department official at AST's
Tokyo roadshow was significant to the company and, it
maintains, to Japanese perceptions. The point was underlined
last week when Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher himself
visited AST here in Orange County. Mr. Qureshey says he's
hired 13 support staffers in Japan and followed all the
technical and protocol rules in bringing his PC to the brink
of the world's second-largest market -- "we made that initial
effort so that we don't get accused like the rest of {this}
country of being lazy, or just complaining." Thus a failure
to enter could result only from artificial barriers. He longs
for the day when a Computerland chain in Japan could sell his
wares.
   In getting to free trade, which he says is the natural
preference of an innovative industry such as his, Mr.
Qureshey welcomes Washington's involvement in some areas and
decries it in others:
   He supports a Securities Industry Association petition to
cite Japan as an unfair trader in semiconductors under the
"Super 301" provision of the trade law. Such action "builds a
case" that can be helpful to his own selling efforts. Mr.
Qureshey speaks of American consumers as being synonymous in
interest with U.S. exporters: "Japan has to look at us as
being their biggest customer. How do you take care of your
customers?"
   Nevertheless, he opposes managed trade as represented by
the U.S.-Japan semiconductor pact of the mid-1980s. That was
an instance of "one company" pushing through import limits
that adversely affected most of high-tech, he says, prompting
more products to be built offshore while U.S. makers paid and
charged higher prices and suffered a spate of thefts from
precious chip inventories.
   Though he thinks protectionists such as Rep. Dick Gephardt
(D., Mo.) go too far, he says the good cop/bad cop routine of
the administration and Congress on trade helps to budge
Tokyo. The Toshiba-bashing a few years ago, merited or not,
"had a good effect."
   Relaxing U.S. antitrust rules would help American chip
makers share production-cost burdens, but government
sponsorship of entities such as the ill-fated U.S. Memories
is welcome, too, says this buyer of what would be subsidized
semiconductors.
   Why should taxpayers help to finance high-tech? Mr.
Qureshey says they do the same for other exporters, such as
wheat, that have less strategic importance. Grain
relationships begin anew with each contract, he explains,
whereas "if you sell them a thousand tractors or a thousand
computers, they're somewhat dependent on you for continuity."
Again, commercial interests are equated with national
interests in his mind.
   During a February market inspection of the Soviet Union,
Mr. Qureshey says, "all I saw were Taiwanese products. They
say `we want to buy American products, but we can't afford
them.' " Washington should help to grease "selective" deals.
But the most important favor it could render high-tech, and
the cause that actually brought him together with Commerce
before the Japan venture broke, is the relaxation of export
controls slapped on for national-security reasons. AST must
pay "really high-cost" personnel to monitor compliance, he
complains, adding, "if you visit one of our Taiwanese
competitors, you will not find any such person of that
caliber, sitting there adding overhead."
   The list of woes goes on, including the high relative cost
of capital in the U.S. (although he doesn't mention the
capital-gains tax until asked). But the Pakistan-born Mr.
Qureshey does acknowledge a big advantage of the American
industry: immigration. Not only were he and the other two
founders of AST from abroad, but nearly 10% of his engineers
are immigrants, he estimates. U.S. colleges are magnets for
such talent; Mr. Qureshey holds a degree from the University
of Texas. In addition, U.S. firms have an easier time
shuttling workers at foreign affiliates into the home
country.
   "We are still the most creative nation. Simply from a
high-tech point of view, we {gain} a tremendous leap" from
immigration, he says. "The Germanys {of the world} will
realize that trying to keep such a homogeneous population has
some drawbacks that they may not have realized."
   A different immigration boon is evident at AST's U.S.
production facility in Fountain Valley, 10 miles away from
the headquarters. Located closer to where the workers can
afford to live, the plant is near Little Saigon, the largest
Vietnamese community in the U.S. Customer service, testing
and a supply depot also are here, and employees of those
units are a typical Orange County mix, but most of the
assembly force -- at $5.50 to $6.50 an hour -- appears to be
Asian. The work is routine, but requires attention to detail.
   AST screens new hires for drugs use. John Olson, vice
president for operations, grumbled that recently five of six
applicants for warehousing had failed. And how many aspirants
for the assembly line had been "kicked out"? None.

   Again Increases
   Cost Estimates

   LONDON -- Eurotunnel PLC once again raised the cost
estimates for the cross-channel link and unveiled the
outlines of a new financing plan.
   But in raising the estimated cost of the project to as
much as #7.6 billion ($12.46 billion), Eurotunnel's chief
executive officer, Alastair Morton, promised that the bad
news should be coming to an end. "We don't intend to go
through this process again," he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Investors will likely remain skeptical, because of the
tunnel's history of revised cost estimates and funding
arrangements. In 1987, managers of the Anglo-French project
set the total cost at about #4.9 billion. More recently,
Transmanche-Link, or TML, a consortium of 10 contractors,
came in with hefty cost overruns that pushed the estimated
cost to #7.2 billion.
   The current plan for shoring up the financing involves an
equity rights offering of as much as #500 million. Before
that, however, Eurotunnel will have to arrange new loans of
as much as #2 billion with a consortium of 208 banks.
   Eurotunnel officials said that under the new plan, funds
available for the project, including lines of credit, should
amount to #8 billion to #8.5 billion. Mr. Morton stressed
that this funding should provide an adequate cushion against
future cost overruns.
   Analysts said they believe the project is firming up its
finances, but they also think uncertainties will plague the
tunnel, and its shareholders, through the summer. "What are
the banks going to demand in the talks in June?" asked one
analyst in the City. "It's not a done deal."
   Another uncertainty, noted William Beazington, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities in London, is whether
the Thatcher government will resolve questions over the rail
links between London and Folkestone, the English terminus for
the channel tunnel. "Unfortunately, it's seen as a blot on
the landscape," he said. These concerns have created snarls
in deciding on how the connecting rail lines would be routed.
   The success of the bank agreement, along with the Thatcher
government's plans for the connecting rail links, will have a
major impact on the success of the equity rights offering.
   Meanwhile, actual construction of the tunnel is apparently
proceeding more smoothly than the financing. The tunnel is
half completed, having started the year only one-third
complete.

   Bonn Offers East Germans Generous Plan
   For Monetary Union in Bid to Calm Fears

   BONN -- In a bid to reassure East Germans worried about
losing their life savings in a monetary union, the West
German government unveiled the outlines of a generous plan
for merging the two nations' currencies.
   Under the proposal, individual East German wages and
savings of as much as 4,000 marks ($2,373) would be changed
into West German marks at a favorable one-to-one rate.
Pensions also would be swapped on that basis, giving retirees
more spending power than they now have.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The offer -- still only an opening position for the coming
negotiations -- is a major concession to the East German
government, which argued that East German workers need to be
cushioned during their bumpy transition to a market economy.
   As the two nations hurtle toward economic and monetary
union, now set for as early as this July, Bonn is under
pressure to offer a favorable package to the East. East
Germany heavily subsidizes everything from housing to
groceries, and many East Germans fear they would become the
permanent underclass in a united Germany unless something is
done to put more money in their pockets.
   Meanwhile, West Germans have begun to balk at shouldering
the bulk of the costs of unity. Many in the West, including
officials of the powerful Bundesbank, or central bank, say a
generous exchange rate would fuel inflation and raise
interest rates.
   As a compromise, the West Germans are proposing exchanging
savings above 4,000 marks at a less-favorable two-to-one
rate. Debts held by individual East Germans and businesses
also would be exchanged at the lower rate.
   Beyond this, the plan leaves plenty of room for
negotiation. For example, while calling for one-to-one parity
in wages, the plan says nothing about how wage rates would
actually be set. Many workers could still see their relative
wages fall as managers introduce free-market mechanisms and
negotiate new union contracts.
   As if to underscore such uncertainties, East German
Finance Minister Walter Romberg yesterday predicted that at
least 20% of the East's crumbling factories could go out of
business once the two economies integrated. An additional 50%
would need financial help to survive, he said, while only 30%
would be fit to compete on their own. Against this
background, West German officials say they had little choice
but to offer generous terms.
   East Germans continue to flow into the West, albeit more
slowly than earlier this year. Unless West Germany can offer
a package that reassures East Germans that they aren't better
off moving to the West, this exodus could continue.
   "We feel this proposal is a good offer for the beginning,"
says one top aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The
aide adds that the West German leader has stayed in close
contact with his East German counterpart, Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere, and that Bonn "got signals" that East
Berlin was ready to strike a compromise on these sensitive
issues. Only after such basic questions are clarified can the
two countries grapple with the complex details involved in
full monetary union.
   The East Germans wasted no time in responding to the
offer. Mr. de Maiziere will be in Bonn today to discuss the
plan with Mr. Kohl and expert-level negotiations might begin
within a week. An East German government spokesman dubbed the
plan "an acceptable basis for negotiations." But Wolfgang
Ullman, vice president of the East German parliament,
criticized the one-to-one limit on exchanging savings.
   "If this is the final decision," he said, "there should be
sharp protest, because a large part of savings won't be
considered here."
   The West German plan is supposed to do two things, calm
the fears of East Germans and remain manageable for the
powerful West German economy. West German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel, speaking to his European Community counterparts
in Luxembourg yesterday, said the proposal wouldn't boost
West German inflation. He said increased East German savings,
prompted by introduction of market interest rates, would
offset inflationary pressure created by the injection of West
German marks into the East.
   Sources at the Bundesbank, however, made it clear that
they remain dubious supporters of the plan. "It's a
government decision, and it is they who in the end must carry
the responsibility," said a Bundesbank official. "Anyway, it
is our impression that this is merely a proposal that must
first be negotiated with the DDR {East Germany}."
   Most East Germans have less than 4,000 marks in their bank
accounts, one reason this figure was chosen as a cutoff
point. But the people with huge savings accounts are often
former entrepreneurs who were forced to sell their businesses
to the state during the years of communist dictatorship.
These are the same people who now would be most likely to
invest in new businesses.
   Groups representing East German entrepreneurs already have
called for exemptions from the exchange limits to allow
people to use their savings to build up new ventures. But
working out such exemptions will be difficult, considering
the pressure to move quickly.
   The West German plan leaves many of the most complex
problems untouched. It says nothing, for instance, about the
introduction of a West German-style taxation system or other
details on economic and monetary union.
   The most generous aspect of the proposal is its treatment
of pensions. Retirees in East Germany get about 450 marks a
month, about one-third of their West German counterparts. A
one-to-one exchange would doom East German retirees to
poverty.
   So the West Germans recommended that the East adopt a
pension system styled on their own, with pensions pegged to
70% of the average net income over 45 years of employment.
The result, in many cases, will be hefty pension increases.

   AT&amp;T Debt
   Gets Upgrade
   From Moody's

   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
upgraded its rating on American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
$9.2 billion in senior debt, the first such boost for the
company since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
   The rating concern said it based the upgrade, to
double-A-3 from single-A-1, on AT&amp;T's recent reorganization
into a "much more efficient and competitive business entity .
. . {and its} ongoing cost reduction programs." Moody's said
the steps would improve profit and cash flow, noting that
AT&amp;T has put most of its large restructuring costs behind it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An AT&amp;T spokesman said of the action by Moody's, "They
reflect the same optimism we have."
   The new rating isn't the highest ever at AT&amp;T. In 1982,
when the company still owned and ran the Bell System, its
senior debt was rated triple-A-3.
   Moody's said on March 12 that it was considering the
upgrade, which includes AT&amp;T Euronotes and Eurobonds and
senior debts of AT&amp;T Credit Corp. and AT&amp;T Technologies Inc.,
which are guaranteed by the parent.
   Moody's on Feb. 1 confirmed its single-A-1 rating for the
telecommunications company.
   The latest announcement said AT&amp;T's reorganization,
together with cost-cutting, will result in "enhanced
profitability and more predictable cash flow protection for
debt." Cash flow is net income plus depreciation. Moody's
said it assumes that new pricing flexibility being allowed by
the Federal Communications Commission for long-distance
services will continue.
   Moody's said it expects that AT&amp;T's debt will remain
relatively high during the intermediate term, as the company
continues to spend heavily for global competition through
internal growth and acquisitions in both its manufacturing
businesses and financial services.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AT&amp;T shares closed at $40.375, down 50 cents.

   Coca-Cola Sets Invasion of East Germany,
   Plans $140 Million in Investments There

   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co., hoping to match its huge success
in West Germany, is starting a push into East Germany with
$140 million in capital investments.
   The soft-drink giant said negotiations are under way with
beverage organizations in East Germany to bottle and
distribute Coca-Cola throughout the country. The $140 million
would be used to upgrade machinery, trucks, vending machines
and other sales equipment connected with as many as six
bottling plants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Coca-Cola spokesman said negotiations are expected to be
completed before the summer.
   East Germany could represent a significant addition to
Coke's highly profitable overseas operations. International
sales today account for 80% of the company's soft-drink
operating profit and 65% of soft-drink revenue. West Germany
alone accounts for about 12% of Coke's earnings, said Emanuel
Goldman, an analyst with PaineWebber Research in San
Francisco.
   By contrast, Coke's domestic sales have been lackluster.
While the company's international volume grew by 9% in the
first quarter, retail case sales in the U.S. increased 3%,
with fountain volume rising a slim 1%.
   Coke first moved to take advantage of the East German
market last fall when the Berlin Wall began to crumble,
offering free soft drinks to people crossing the border.
Since mid-February, Coke has sold more than two million cases
of soft drinks in East Germany, shipped into the country from
bottling plants in West Germany and France. By comparison,
the company sold about four million cases in Poland in all of
1989.
   The fact that Coke is already a known commodity in East
Germany -- its West German television ads have been seen by
East German viewers for 30 years-and the existence of
bottling facilities in the country mean that Coke should be
able to break into the market more easily and more quickly
than it would normally in a foreign country.
   "The demand is there, and the awareness is there," said a
Coke spokesman. "But up until now, there's just been an
inability to buy the product."
   Added Mr. Goldman at PaineWebber: "The key is
availability. If there's one thing Coca-Cola has shown it can
do, it's making the product available and affordable. If they
can meld the two operations (in East and West Germany),
there's a potential for substantial profits."
   The company's move into East Germany comes on the heels of
PepsiCo Inc.'s new trade agreement with the Soviet Union. The
Purchase, N.Y., company plans to spend more than $1 billion
to upgrade and expand bottling plants and to provide
concentrate, among other things. The accord could double
Pepsi's sales in the Soviet Union during the next 10 years.
The company sold about 40 million cases there in 1989. Coke
sold about 20 million cases of all its products, including
Fanta orange drink, in the Soviet Union.
   While Pepsi claims to have a substantial lead over Coke in
most of Eastern Europe, Pepsi acknowledges that East Germany
is the one country in the bloc where Coke is dominant. A
Pepsi spokesman said yesterday, however, that the company is
"aggressively pursuing" franchise operations in East Germany
and expects to reach agreements with some East German
bottlers in the "next few weeks." The spokesman declined to
elaborate.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   A Trade Deficit Primer

   As an April 30 deadline looms, the tom-toms of trade war
are once again beating at George Bush to take a "Super 301"
swipe at Japan, and maybe South Korea too. It's time to
repeat that the conventional wisdom on trade deficits has it
all exactly backward.
   The U.S. does not have a trade deficit with Japan because
this country consumes too much and must therefore borrow to
pay the bill. The trade deficit exists because Japan has to
find somewhere to invest its huge pool of savings. The United
States, which happens to be a very good place to invest, then
buys Toyotas to recycle those savings back to Japan through
the trade account. In other words, the trade deficit is a
sign of American economic vigor, not weakness.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We know this may sound startling, because the conventional
wisdom has deemed that somehow there is a perfect trade
"balance," presumably at or close to zero. This logic ignores
the central truth of foreign trade flows: There can't be a
trade deficit without offsetting capital inflows. The trade
deficit or surplus is merely an accounting identity.
   To refresh some memories on this point, it's worth
reprinting the 1976 conclusions of the U.S. Advisory
Committee on the Presentation of Balance of Payments
Statistics. This was not a group of economic yahoos, but
included Morgan Guaranty's Rimmer de Vries, Brookings's
Walter Salant and Charles Schwartz of the International
Monetary Fund. The committee said:
   "The words `surplus' and `deficit' should be avoided
insofar as possible. . . . These words are frequently taken
to mean that the developments are `good' or `bad'
respectively. Since that interpretation is often incorrect,
the terms may be widely misunderstood and used in lieu of
analysis."
   So long as foreign investment here is voluntary and
private, a trade deficit is a motor of growth and prosperity.
If it's a trade surplus we want, there's one quick way to get
it: recession. To put it another way, in today's global
economy, investment or capital flows drive trade flows,
rather than vice versa. A mere two weeks of capital flows add
up to more than a year's worth of trade flows. Trade is the
result not the cause.
   With that in mind, it's hard to understand why the U.S. as
the world's leading economic power should pick trade fights
with Japan or anyone else. With Japan's trade surplus, its
high (and for years subsidized) savings rate and anemic
consumption, where else but the U.S. can Japan's money go? If
Japan's dollars weren't somehow recycled, we'd all be in a
fix that would take the "trade deficit" right out of the
economic news.
   So what's driving U.S. trade policy? Clear as day:
politics, especially lobbying by U.S. producer interests. The
201 and Super 301 trade-retaliation sections of the 1988
trade bill are engraved invitations for special corporate
pleading. Indeed, they were expressly designed by Congress to
make Congress and the interests it represents bigger players
in trade policy.
   One year into the law, industry has already formed a
protectionist queue at the 301 table. Last year it was wood
products, satellites and supercomputers. This year, the
foremost agitators are auto parts and computer chips. The
Semiconductor Industry Association, in effect a lobby for
only two companies, has sent a letter urging a 301 case to
virtually the entire Bush Cabinet.
   We have no problem with diplomacy to open markets or
remove Japan's ridiculous trade barriers. Japanese consumers
are themselves agitating for lower prices and better goods,
and the American voice is a useful echo. But in modern trade
politics, no Tokyo concession ever seems to be enough.
Despite recent Japanese concessions in satellites and
computers, Senators John Danforth (R., Mo.) and Max Baucus
(D., Mont.) want George Bush to hit 'em again. Presumably,
the Senators' logic is that one good turn deserves only
another rebuke.
   It may be, of course, that America's trade warriors really
don't understand what they're asking Japan to do. The reforms
they're seeking would actually make Japan's economy more
efficient, and more competitive too. If Japan changes its
retail-store law to allow American-style supermarkets, for
example, Japanese will pay less of their income for food.
Their savings will then increase, creating an even larger
capital outflow and thus a larger U.S. trade deficit.
   This is fine with those of us who think the trade deficit
is really nothing to worry about. In fact, if our trade
warriors are now admitting they agree, we're happy to welcome
them aboard.

   CONCORD, Mass. -- Henry David Thoreau, brace yourself. The
philanthropists are coming.
   Rock star Don Henley is leading the charge, bringing with
him actors Don Johnson and Carrie Fisher and singers Bonnie
Raitt, Arlo Guthrie and Bob Seger. Their mission is to save
Walden Pond from developers, to keep it free from the blot of
civilization.
   They will do this in the way they know best, by charging
locals $22 a ticket to hear them talk about the Pond and sing
some classic rock 'n' roll. Two concerts are planned --
tonight and tomorrow night -- and it's all for a good cause.
   Or is it?
   Mr. Henley -- formerly of the Eagles (hit song: "Hotel
California") and the host of the party where Gary Hart met
Donna Rice -- thought he was going to save Walden Pond from
an office building and condominiums. But it turns out that
the condo project includes some affordable housing -- of
which there is precious little in this exclusive community.
   Suddenly, solid liberal ground became a little shaky. One
state official, implying that Mr. Henley had been hoodwinked,
wrote him a letter cautioning that "the environmental
objections being raised . . . are a thinly veiled attempt" by
hoity-toity Concordians to keep out hoi polloi.
   Besides, others chime in, Walden isn't exactly the
pristine retreat it was when Henry David (as the
philosopher/naturalist is called here) was trekking around
the woods in the 19th century. The office building, proposed
by developer and magazine publisher Mortimer Zuckerman,
wouldn't really mar the scenic shores of Walden. The site is
separated from the pond by a heavily traveled four-lane
highway, the town dump and a trailer park.
   More than a few locals think it's a bit ironic that
jet-setting stars are claiming kinship with the frugal Mr.
Thoreau. But, Mr. Henley told a Boston newspaper, "Thoreau
and Emerson had a great deal of influence in my life. They
made me more aware of nature and the environment." He noted
that he read "Walden" while studying English at North Texas
State University about 20 years ago.
   In a letter to the state, he wrote: "Pieces of our
heritage disappear one by one without people even noticing.
It always comes down to Nature vs. Economics. Nature vs.
Jobs. Nature vs. Profit. Nature vs. this thing we call
`progress' -- and Nature always loses."
   When Mr. Henley found out about the proposed developments,
he offered help to Thomas Blanding, a Thoreau scholar and
president of the Thoreau Country Conservation Alliance.
   No one really doubts the rock star's sincerity. He just
happens to have stepped into a battle that's been going on
for several years, with Mr. Blanding's forces on one side and
the development and housing forces on the other.
   The debate in part reflects Concord's own schizophrenia.
It is trying to maintain its rich past: It was at the Old
North Bridge in Concord on April 19, 1775, that the British
were turned back by the Minutemen. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mr.
Thoreau's mentor, lived here. So did Nathaniel Hawthorne and
Louisa May Alcott.
   But it is also trying to maintain its rich present: In
recent years Concord has become an expensive suburb, a home
for wealthy Boston commuters. Mr. Thoreau built his humble
one-room home on Walden Pond for $28.12 1/2 cents. Today,
Concord homes cost an average of $300,000; some fetch more
than $1 million.
   Streets are lined with fashionable shops and real-estate
agencies. The entrees at Walden Station Restaurant include
Chicken Thoreau -- "excellent mesquite flavored boneless
breast, with shiitake mushrooms and a boursin cream sauce" --
a dish Mr. Thoreau never mentions cooking on his wood stove
at Walden Pond.
   The pond -- actually more the size of a lake -- lies a
mile-and-a-half south of the town center. Here, Mr. Thoreau
lived a life of contemplation from July 1845 to September
1847. It was an almost idyllic spot, judging by but one
description in his book: "This small lake was of most value
as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in
August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but
the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of
evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from
shore to shore."
   The pond is still beautiful, its water clear and smooth as
glass on a windless day. And, with 411 acres surrounding the
pond given to the state by the Emerson family and others in
1922, the immediate area hasn't been developed.
   But if a wood thrush sings nowadays, you can't hear it,
much less from the other shore.
   At one end of the pond is a man-made beach that draws
thousands of swimmers on hot summer weekends. Anglers line
the shore hoping to catch the trout that's stocked in the
pond by the state. A concrete boat launch sits at one corner
(though only canoes and rowboats are allowed). Constant
traffic on nearby roads creates incessant noise.
   The undulating hills in the surrounding area, where Mr.
Thoreau walked and meditated, are still wooded and, in
places, relatively tranquil. Here -- well out of sight of the
pond -- the new condominiums are planned.
   While Thoreauvians concede that the woods are already
dotted with high-priced homes, they argue that the condos and
office building, though at two separate sites, take
development one step too far. "It's a domino effect. They
talk about the dump across the road," says Ann Chapman, a
Thoreauvian. "If you put this {office building} in, it would
justify another development. What's enough?"
   Planning officials defend the projects. The condos would
be about three-fourths of a mile away from Walden Pond, not
on its shores, notes Judith Chanoux Cutler, Concord's town
planner. Also, the 139-unit condo project, a venture between
two Boston developers, would include 42 units of low- or
moderate-income housing subsidized by the state. The state
approved it because less than 3% of Concord's housing is
classed as affordable.
   Concord policeman D.A. Goranson, who grew up in town,
favors the projects. "I know Walden Pond, and this isn't the
Walden Pond I knew as a child," he says. Anyway, he adds, the
area needs affordable housing. "Many town employees can't
live here because they can't afford it," he notes.
   Had it not been for Mr. Henley, the matter probably would
have been merely debated over coffee, talked about after
church. But then he stepped in. Radio stations began
promoting the concerts and the issue became more public.
   Mr. Henley and the Thoreauvians now promise to help find
another spot in Concord for affordable housing -- and pitch
in money to buy the land. But that will be easier said than
done. Notes Ms. Cutler, "Nobody supports affordable housing
unless it's someplace else. It's not easy to find another
site."
   If no other site can be found, Mr. Henley wrote that he
would "explore the possibility" of building the affordable
units at the existing site, but not the higher-priced condos.
Mr. Henley is no longer giving interviews.
   But first his group will have to raise the money to buy
that site and the office site, a total that could exceed $10
million. The two concerts this week might net $500,000,
supporters estimate, so more celebrity bashes may be
necessary.
   The Thoreauvians do have one well-heeled convert already:
Mr. Zuckerman. While insisting there is nothing wrong with
his proposed office building, he says he would happily sell
it for no profit -- and will even contribute $100,000 to
their cause.

   Evangelical Perestroika in Oxford

   The intellectual foundation of socialism disintegrated
years ago; the system's political base collapsed last year.
But until now collectivism has retained an important pillar
of support: theology.
   Although Christian socialism is not new, during the 1970s
and 1980s influential groups within established churches
increasingly turned toward collectivism. A vigorous left wing
arose even among evangelicals. In an attempt to bring greater
coherence to the evangelical community's widely divergent
views on economics, a meeting was held in Oxford, Britain, in
January, attended by more than 100 theologians, economists
and others.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The initial odds of achieving the meeting's goal of
drafting a sensible consensus declaration didn't look good.
   When such a conference was first held in Oxford, in 1987,
most conferees, though not doctrinaire socialists, were
highly skeptical of the market for the most part. For
instance, one paper at that meeting discussed "an impressive
list" of central planning's benefits. In attendance in 1990
was Andrew Kirk, a leading British theologian and author of a
book contending that "Marxism has exalted collective freedom
-- the freedom of everyone to enjoy a basically dignified
life." The preliminary conference documents, while
recognizing the importance of market forces, also included
many collectivist nostrums.
   Yet just as the world has been changing, so has
evangelicals' economic thinking. Avowed free-market
supporters were in a minority, but their ideas framed the
discussion. And support for less intrusive government came
not only from Americans, but also from "two-thirds world"
participants, in conference parlance.
   In this atmosphere the conferees developed their
statement, "The Oxford Declaration on Christian Faith and
Economics," for public release. If it would not totally
satisfy an economist from the Chicago or Austrian school, it
describes a less regulated nation than the U.S.
   On poverty and justice, the attendees achieved a
surprising degree of agreement. "The causes of poverty are
many and complex," stated the declaration, including "the
cultural attitudes and actions taken by social, economic,
political and religious institutions" that "erect barriers to
economic production."
   The conferees denounced protectionism, inflationary
policies, and "economic systems based on policies, laws and
regulations whose effect is to favor privileged minorities
and to exclude the poor from fully legitimate activities."
Indeed, in a line that could have come from the Libertarian
Party platform, the document went on to declare that "such
systems are not only inefficient, but are immoral as well."
   What did the conferees believe the proper role of
government to be? Bigger than would be accepted by Milton
Friedman, but smaller than that envisioned by the liberation
theologians or perhaps even some Bush administration
officials.
   The conferees emphasized that "a dispersion of the means
of production is a significant component of democracy" and
that "widespread ownership" of property "tends to
decentralize power and prevent totalitarianism." Avoiding the
penchant of many people to blame markets for problems caused
by government intervention, the declaration warned not only
of the danger of concentrated economic power in centrally
planned systems, but also that "heavy state involvement and
regulation within market economies can also result in
concentrations of power that effectively marginalize poorer
members of society."
   The document did endorse "sustenance rights," but went on
to acknowledge that "such rights must be carefully defined so
that government's involvement will not encourage
irresponsible behavior and the breakdown of families and
communities" and that the state's role should be one "of last
resort." The conferees extolled the role of mediating
institutions and warned that "government must also have
regard for economic efficiency and appropriately limit its
own scope and action."
   Although not perfect, the Oxford document is far better
than anything that would have come from most any other recent
international religious gathering. From what stems this
shift? Reality obviously played a major role. One conference
leader noted that history appeared to have rendered its
judgment on socialism. Another factor was the growing
recognition within the Third World of the problems of state
intervention. Latin American delegates, for instance, paid
special attention to Hernando de Soto's path-breaking work in
Peru. Perhaps most important was the fact that even those who
leaned to the left were open to argument and willing to
change their minds.
   If left-leaning evangelicals can come to believe in the
superiority of an open economy, so too can Catholic
liberation theologians and Protestant adherents to the social
gospel. After that, socialism would truly be dead.

   NEW YORK -- Forget Madonna, Motley Crue, Janet Jackson and
the other current staples of Top 40 radio.
   The hottest format across the radio dial these days
showcases performers who haven't had hits in decades, such as
Dion and the Belmonts, Elvis Presley, The Supremes and Lesley
Gore.

<TEXT>
   Since last year, the number of stations that program the
solid gold format has ballooned about 20%, making it one of
the fastest-growing formats, according to Broadcasting
magazine. "I've been following radio for about 20 years, and
I've never seen anything like this," says James Duncan Jr.,
publisher of American Radio, a quarterly analysis of radio
ratings, programming trends and financial data.
   By attracting baby boomers in the key 25-54 age group that
advertisers covet most, the oldies but goodies are turning
out to be pure gold for stations such as New York's
all-oldies WCBS-FM. "A lot of stations are looking for the
quick fix, and solid gold is it," says Joe McCoy, program
director at WCBS-FM, which switched from album-oriented rock
to oldies in 1972. "The aging of America is looking for
consistency and familiarity," he says.
   WCBS-FM, which has become steadily more popular since the
early 1970s, reached a milestone last week. For the first
time in its history as an oldies station, it finished as the
top-ranked radio station in New York in ratings compiled by
Arbitron Co., a unit of Control Data Corp. The station, owned
by CBS Inc., also finished No. 1 among 25-to-54-year-olds.
Mr. Duncan of American Radio predicts that WCBS-FM will be
the third-largest money-making station in the country, with
ad revenues of about $30 million. It trails only WGN-AM in
Chicago, with projected billings of $35 million, and KABC-AM
in Los Angeles, with $32 million.
   Even in markets where the oldies station has average or
below-average ratings overall, its popularity with affluent
listeners in the key demographic group is strong. For
example, in Boston, even though oldies station WODS-FM
finished a mediocre No. 11 in overall ratings, it scored its
fourth consecutive No. 1 victory in the 25-to-54 age group.
   "No question that the most attractive demographic likes to
listen to oldies," says Richard Cotter, vice president and
regional broadcast manager in the New York office of J.
Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group PLC. Mr. Cotter adds
that the age group also gravitates to adult contemporary
(Neil Diamond, Fleetwood Mac, Kenny Rogers) and all-news
outlets.
   The success of the oldies format is prompting a number of
stations with mediocre ratings in other formats to make the
switch. "Stations are searching for a format that would
attract the baby boomers, and in a lot of markets, the format
did not exist," says Gerry Boehme, vice president and
director of research at Katz Radio Group, a subsidiary of
Katz Communications Inc.
   Earlier this month, for example, Infinity Broadcasting
Corp. switched its lackluster adult contemporary station in
Detroit to oldies. "It's a big moneymaker, and you don't have
to depend on high-visibility morning shows," says Mel
Karmazin, president and chief executive officer of Infinity,
which also operates album-oriented rock and so-called classic
rock stations in cities such as New York, Los Angeles and
Boston. "As an oldies station, you may not be everybody's No.
1 choice, but you are everyone's No. 2 choice," Mr. Karmazin
adds.
   Not everyone is thrilled about the oldies boom. Despite
the surge in music video as a marketing tool for new
recording artists, record companies still rely in part on
radio to move new material. "The record companies do not like
this format," says Nancy C. Widmann, president of the CBS
radio division, which owns 20 stations, including 12 FM
outlets, five with the oldies format. "We don't move their
product."
   An official at CBS Records, which is now a subsidiary of
Sony Corp., says that it would be in the best interests of
the record industry if each radio station would broadcast
both current and past hits. However, he acknowledges that may
be an unrealistic expectation, given the trend toward
identifiable formats.
   Some stations were initially wary of the oldies format,
which includes a heavy diet of The Beatles, The Rolling
Stones and other mainstays of the 1960s. Their executives
were concerned that people would naturally tire of songs they
were so familiar with. After all, how many times could you
hear The Dave Clark Five belt out "Over and Over"?
   "Some stations were afraid of the format because they
thought it would burn out," says Bill Clark, president of
Shamrock Broadcasting Co., which owns four oldies stations in
cities such as Denver and Atlanta. "But people identify with
an era of music and love to hear it again and again," he
says, adding that "for people who are 35 to 45 years old, the
oldies stations will be their equivalent of the big band
stations their parents listen to."

   Hook Fights a Cruel Sea
   At American General Helm

   HOUSTON -- Harold S. Hook, it might be said, faces a
potential Tomato Plant Probem: One of the Seven Ports of
Management is trying to derail his Northbound Train. It's a
Cruel Sea, indeed.
   Loosely translated: Mr. Hook is stretched thin by
Torchmark Corp.'s proxy fight against American General Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Hook, American General's 58-year-old chairman,
invented these and 147 other buzzwords three decades ago to
teach his management theories to insurance company
colleagues. His copyrighted system, "Model-Netics," gave
workers a symbolic language to deal with business problems
and helped build American General into one of the nation's
biggest -- with $32 billion in assets -- and most profitable
life insurers by the mid-1980s.
   But now, after watching American General's earnings and
stock price stagnate for the last three years, Mr. Hook faces
perhaps the thorniest business problem of his career:
Persuading shareholders that his team, rather than
Torchmark's, is the best-equipped to get the company back on
track.
   From his perch atop American General's 43-story corporate
headquarters here, the portly yet boyish-looking executive is
directing an all-out assault against Torchmark, which is
trying to place five directors on American General's
15-member board. American General is fighting the effort in
federal court here and taking up the matter with insurance
regulators of 10 different states. And Mr. Hook and 50 top
managers are hitting the phones day and night to lobby
shareholders before the May 2 annual meeting.
   It isn't necessarily an easy sell, as even Mr. Hook
admits. "We've made no secret over the past two years that
we've been restructuring," he says, leaning forward in his
chair. "But the results have been difficult to understand."
   Indeed, while stock analysts generally praised American
General's decision to sell its property-liability and group
health operations last year for more than $900 million,
they've lambasted the company for failing to digest quickly
enough some of the big acquisitions it has made in the last
decade. Overhead remains high in American General's
bread-and-butter home service operations, and the company has
been slow to consolidate the consumer finance business it
bought from Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in 1988.
   Net income, meanwhile, tumbled 28% to $464 million, or
$3.76 a share, in 1989 from the company's high of $648
million, or $4.33 a share, in 1986. Over that period the
stock price drifted to $31.25, or a measly 84% of book value,
from the 1986 close of $36.88. In the first quarter, net
improved to $107.1 million, or 90 cents a share, from $97.2
million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier.
   "There may be some true benefits forthcoming from
digesting acquisitions and consolidating operations," says
Herbert E. Goodfriend, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. "But I think returns to stockholders on an
earnings and a total basis don't measure up to institutional
investors' expectations."
   Enter Torchmark. The brash, Birmingham, Ala., insurer, one
sixth the size of its target, burst onto the scene last month
with an unsolicited offer to buy American General for $50 a
share in cash and stock, or $6.3 billion. Investors seemed to
take the upstart seriously, bidding American General's shares
up to $40.25. Torchmark later dropped the bid in favor of a
proxy fight, but some on Wall Street are still rooting for a
merger.
   Among other things, some analysts think the two companies
would be a perfect fit, because both have big home-service
operations -- an unglamorous but cashrich business in which
salespeople peddle life insurance to poor and middle-income
families in their homes. And they also believe Torchmark's
cost-cutting success might rub off on American General.
   But Mr. Hook begs to differ. "It's like talking apples and
oranges" to compare cost structures, he asserts, because
Torchmark "is an organically grown company," while American
General grew by gobbling others. Its acquisitions of NLT
Corp. in 1982, for $1.5 billion and Gulf United's insurance
operations in 1984 for $1.2 billion, still rank as the
largest buy-outs in the life insurance industry. Such huge
mergers take time to fit, he argues; American General doesn't
expect to begin realizing big savings from a consolidation of
its two home-service hubs until early 1991.
   And Mr. Hook fears a merger might make the companies too
concentrated in home service and too debt-ridden. "Whether or
not a put-together would end up with two-plus-two equaling
five or two-plus-two equaling three would be an interesting
question," he says.
   Once regarded as the wunderkind of the insurance business,
Mr. Hook ran his first company at age 31. He became president
of American General in 1975 after the company, impressed with
his work as president of California-Western States Life
Insurance Co. in Sacramento, acquired controlling interest.
Three years later he was named chairman and chief executive.
   During the 1980s, Mr. Hook directed enormous changes in
the once-sleepy insurer, quintupling assets with acquisitions
of a consumer finance business and home service competitors,
among others, and then narrowed American General's focus by
shedding group health and property-liability lines.
   Mr. Hook also made a minor splash with his Model-Netics
management program, which he sold to other corporations and
government agencies through a company he owns in California,
Main Event Management Corp. Using jargon and pictographs that
call to mind some New Age religion, the program encourages
employees to pull in the same direction -- "The Northbound
Train" -- by giving them a common language to use in solving
problems.
   Adherents say Model-Netics has played a key role in
creating a unified corporate culture in American General's
patchwork-quilt of acquired subsidiaries. But not everyone is
impressed. The San Diego County government canceled an
experiment with Model-Netics a few years back after workers
protested. "I thought it was awful," says Barbara Collier, a
county training specialist, who called the jargon
"exclusionary."
   But devotees argue that the models boil down to common
sense. A Tomato Plant Problem, for example, is what you get
when you plant more seeds than you can water -- that is, when
you overextend yourself. The Seven Ports of Management
consist of the seven constituencies a manager answers to,
ranging from shareholders to customers to regulators. The
Cruel Sea describes the business environment.
   Lately, Mr. Hook has gotten a feel for just how cruel that
sea is. He argues that he's accomplished a "very tough
assignment" just by keeping earnings more or less level
during a period when American General is, in many ways,
reinventing itself. "It is a little frustrating," he says,
"because you can't expect to really be able to transmit that
in a few paragraphs."

   Experience Gives Ex-Correspondents
   A Jump in Burgeoning Media Field

   WASHINGTON -- Former network correspondents are
discovering that the exploding world of electronic journalism
holds entrepreneurial opportunities for broadcast-industry
dropouts.
   Veteran correspondents Ike Pappas of CBS and Jack Reynolds
and Peter Hackes of NBC left highly visible, well-paying
network jobs, but are bouncing back with their own small
businesses. And they're prospering, in part, by responding to
the very conditions that are making life miserable for the
three major networks: intense competition from independent
stations and the Fox quasi-network, the proliferation of
cable channels, and the increased use of home videocassette
players.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the mid-1980s, Mr. Pappas, a hustling, cherubic
reporter who specialized in defense issues, found himself
increasingly elbowed aside by younger, more telegenic
reporters. In March 1987, CBS Inc. pulled the plug on Mr.
Pappas's 23-year network career. At age 52 he was laid off,
one of 12 correspondents and 200 other CBS employees given
pink slips in a cost-cutting move. Mr. Pappas departed with a
pocketful of severance pay, wondering if his narrow
professional skills were salable.
   For 23 years at CBS, Mr. Pappas says, "the only thing I
thought about was getting on Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather."
Now his thoughts are focused on propelling his own media
enterprise here, a video and film-production company named
Ike Pappas Network Productions Inc. that makes industrials
(corporate-client work) and TV documentaries.
   Broadcast veterans such as Mr. Pappas understand the world
of sound bites, says Tom Angell, the president of Interface
Video Systems Inc., a video-production company here. "People
who can tell stories the way Americans are comfortable with
are going to find themselves a place in this industry," he
says.
   Mr. Reynolds, who says he spent "32 mostly happy years at
NBC," has found a niche producing video news releases. The
videos are available free, by satellite, to roughly 600 local
TV stations, which use such pieces on their news programs.
Mr. Reynolds last week produced a piece dealing with
confusion over the taxation of pension benefits. He
interviewed an Internal Revenue Service assistant
commissioner, a member of Congress, an irate contractor and a
financial adviser.
   The 2 1/2-minute piece, paid for by the American Society
of Pension Actuaries, laid out multiple sides of the issue.
"I was as objective as I could be," Mr. Reynolds says.
   His two-year-old company, Jack Reynolds Communications,
also coaches camera-shy people to communicate effectively on
television. (A second Reynolds company is exploring
international teleconferencing, concentrating on Asia and the
European Community.) Mr. Reynolds, 56, also spent two years
as co-host of a bilingual Japanese program that explored
cultural differences between Americans and Japanese.
   Peter Hackes worked 31 years as an NBC radio and TV
reporter, but jumped in 1987 when the network suggested early
retirement. His on-air time was slipping and other reporters
were getting the plum assignments. "I realized I was on the B
list," he says.
   Now 65, Mr. Hackes juggles a variety of media projects
(and says his earnings in 1989 topped his former NBC salary).
He consults for the American Association of Retired Persons,
which sponsors his 90-second daily radio spot on issues for
the elderly. He has moderated satellite teleconferences on
tax reform and a drug-free workplace.
   And with sweet irony, he was cast in the role of a
TV-network news director in the hit movie "Broadcast News."
"I was the heavy," he says of his movie role. "I fired 27
people."
   The most visible of the ex-network enterprisers is Mr.
Pappas. The videos produced by his two-year-old company,
which he calls Ike Inc. for short, usually feature Mr. Pappas
himself.
   Mr. Pappas, now 55, took the entrepreneurial plunge by
renting a one-room office in the building next door to the
CBS news bureau here. He says, "I turned on the lights and it
was completely bare. I thought, `Well, the rent is running, I
better do something.'" To save money, he bought used
furniture from the defunct public-relations firm of President
Reagan's former confidant, Michael Deaver. "I have Michael
Deaver's stapler on my desk," Mr. Pappas says with a chuckle.
   The start-up gave Mr. Pappas, who admits he seldom thought
about the forces behind his weekly CBS paycheck, a lesson in
business humility. "Cash flow has been a great revelation,"
Mr. Pappas says. "What comes in, goes out. I can see how
people fail very easily."
   Mr. Pappas's company has made fund-raising videos for the
Greek Orthodox Church, the Leukemia Society of America and a
group trying to build a monument here to slain
law-enforcement officers.
   His company turned a profit in its second year, Mr. Pappas
says. The non-network TV and video distributors "all want
programming," he says. "It's a very hungry market out there."
   Mr. Pappas also narrated the TV series "Crimewatch
Tonight," a nightly half-hour chronicle of murders and drug
busts around the nation. The syndicated show ran for 26 weeks
in 90 cities, but wasn't renewed by its producer. Mr. Pappas
says it suffered from poor scheduling, including competition
from Mets baseball games in New York.
   Mr. Pappas sees his image with television viewers as an
asset, and he isn't bashful about promoting himself in
company projects. "We're attempting to do things to keep me
on the air," he says.
   Running a small business is "the most fun I've had in my
life," Mr. Pappas says. But he admits that the switch to
small-business owner hasn't been easy. In his network days,
he stood before the cameras in his trench coat and talked
about such weighty topics as guided missiles and the
strategic arms-limitation talks. "Now I stand in front of a
shopping mall and say, `This is the biggest shopping mall in
the world.' It's a hell of an adjustment."

   Sane U.S. Policy on Hostages -- at Last

   The weekend release of American hostage Robert Polhill
after long captivity in Lebanon shows us something important:
Holding firm against terrorism works. Just last week,
President Bush was facing strong criticism for refusing to
send an envoy to Damascus at the demand of Mr. Polhill's
captors to negotiate the terms of Mr. Polhill's release. But
Mr. Bush chose not to accede to such demands -- and Mr.
Polhill went free all the same.
   The hope is that this lesson will not be forgotten by the
Bush administration. It is a lesson that bears on a
long-standing problem: The release of this American hostage
occurred nearly 10 years to the day after President Carter's
mission to save American hostages in Iran failed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Three U.S. administrations have been manipulated by
hostage-takers. That terrorists, released hostages and the
family members of hostages will work together to pressure the
U.S. government to meet terrorist demands is understandable.
What is not understandable is how the media and successive
American governments have succumbed to the belief that a
"goodwill" gesture by the U.S. toward the hostage-takers is
necessary.
   Let's take a moment to review how terrorism really works.
In Lebanon, Hezbollah and its front groups have been
responsible for the kidnapping of at least 51 foreigners in
Lebanon from 1983 to the end of 1989. According to the latest
intelligence figures, 13 of those hostages died in captivity,
as a result of poor medical care, maltreatment or outright
torture. But uncritical reporting has helped to create the
powerful illusion that the hostages have been killed in
response to the failure of the U.S., Israel or European
nations to meet the demands of the hostage-takers.
   In general, the bark of terrorists holding hostages in
Lebanon has been much worse than their bite. During the past
four years, Lebanese hostage-takers have issued more than 80
threats to kill hostages. Yet, each deadline named by the
terrorists has passed without incident.
   In one study, released in 1989, authors at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies reported
that:
   "Whatever the intent of the terrorists, no direct
connection has been established between the threats and the
death of hostages. Not only have most of the threats not been
carried out, but the few deaths that have occurred served
essentially as retaliation for specific developments or
resulted from deterioration in conditions of captivity and
the state of the health of the hostages."
   The report added that "hostages died of sickness or
torture or were shot trying to escape. Yet their deaths were
later presented by Hezbollah as `executions' and therefore
served the organization's propaganda purposes."
   Let's examine several cases. Islamic Jihad declared in
March 1986 that it had executed French scholar Michel Seurat
in "retaliation for the expulsion of 13 Moslems from France,
including two opponents of the Iraqi regime." A photo of
Seurat was sent to the Beirut news agencies. In fact,
intelligence sources say Seurat died of liver failure --
specifically, hepatitis brought on by unsanitary conditions
and lack of medical attention. Dennis Hill, a British
citizen, was shot to death while attempting to escape two
days after he was kidnapped in May 1985.
   American Peter Kilburn's body was found in April 1986,
immediately after the U.S. bombing of Libya. But there had
been no ultimatum issued by his captors or killers. Kilburn
had been "purchased" from Hezbollah by Libyan agents and
executed by them.
   Islamic Jihad sought to exploit its capture of Central
Intelligence Agency Beirut station chief William Buckley by
issuing a series of threats to kill him in the 13 months
following his kidnapping in 1984. The threats stated that
unless the government of Kuwait released the Al-Dawa 17 --
Shiite terrorists arrested for a series of lethal bombings in
Kuwait -- or, if Kuwait carried out the death sentences that
had been imposed on three of the Al-Dawa 17, then Islamic
Jihad would kill Buckley. In June 1985 the Iranians told
American and Israeli intermediaries that Buckley was still
alive and that his release could be arranged through barter.
   In fact, Buckley almost certainly died in May 1985. He was
either executed outright or died from wounds suffered in
torture inflicted by his captors. His body has never been
recovered. In any case, his killing is virtually certain to
have occurred in the course of a brutal interrogation. The
existence of a 400-page transcript of his "confession" was
frequently mentioned throughout the Iran-Contra affair. But
the purported transcript has never been retrieved and it is
now believed by some American intelligence officials that the
Iranians fabricated the document to enhance their leverage
over the U.S.
   The Iran-Contra affair itself demonstrated the futility of
surrendering to the demands of hostage-takers. To induce the
Iranians to release three American hostages, the U.S. sold
them missiles and performed other acts of capitulation. The
hostages were released -- and three more were taken captive
soon afterward.
   Last summer, President Bush faced his first challenge from
Hezbollah. Israel had kidnapped terrorist commander Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid from south Lebanon on July 28 and then
offered to trade the sheikh for two Israeli soldiers and for
the American hostages held by Hezbollah. Within 36 hours of
the abduction of Sheik Obeid, a typewritten threat was handed
to news agencies in Beirut that said that Lt. Col. William
Higgins would be hanged unless Israel released the sheik.
   The first White House reaction to the threat to kill
Higgins was a blunt refusal to be blackmailed. But the
administration's tough stance soon crumbled. Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole, in remarks that White House and State
Department officials now say were cleared in advance, accused
Israel of "endangering American lives." Mr. Bush himself
echoed Sen. Dole's comments, criticizing the capture of Sheik
Obeid. The president effectively equated the kidnapping of
the sheik with Hezbollah's abduction of Higgins and other
Americans.
   Then, on July 31, Hezbollah announced to the world that it
had hanged Higgins. The organization distributed a grisly
videotape that showed the colonel twisting at the end of a
rope. Several days later, however, American intelligence
firmly concluded that Higgins had actually been executed some
six months earlier by his captors. The tape had been released
in an effort to create the false impression that Higgins had
died because of America's and Israel's failure to heed
Hezbollah's demands.
   At the same time, Hezbollah continued the game. It
threatened to kill a second American hostage, Joseph
Cicippio. This time the U.S. tack was the right one. The
White House ordered a review of the military options
available against Hezbollah, including raids against the
organization's bases in Lebanon by American bombers and
bombardment by U.S. battleships in the Mediterranean. The
White House issued a stern warning to Hezbollah unambiguously
indicating that it would take military action if the
terrorists killed Mr. Cicippio. Deterred, Hezbollah
repeatedly extended its "deadline" for the execution of Mr.
Cicippio -- and then finally dropped the threat altogether.
   But, within six weeks of the release of the video showing
Higgins' death, the administration saw fit to reward Iran. In
September, the administration did nothing to impede an
out-of-court settlement of a 10-year-old lawsuit between
Ashland Oil and the National Iranian Oil Co. that called for
Ashland to pay Iran $325 million. Weeks later, the U.S.
agreed to allow $567 million held in escrow in an English
bank account to be transferred to the Iranian government. The
reason given was that the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal would
otherwise have forced the administration to free up these
funds. But U.S. officials have admitted that there were at
least two years worth of stalling techniques left to the U.S.
-- had it wanted to take a firm line against Iran. The
release of funds to Iran amounted to a decision to let
terrorists get away with killing an American.
   The president's refusal to cave in to the hostage-takers'
demands that he send a top American official to Damascus, and
his pointed refusal to reward Iran for Mr. Polhill's release,
are good signs. But it would be wrong -- and a betrayal of
the 600 Americans who have died since 1983 in
Iranian-sponsored terrorist attacks, like the Lockerbie and
Marine barracks bombings -- to "forgive" Iran or Hezbollah
even if all the remaining hostages are released. For the
moment, though, the U.S. government seems to be headed in the
right direction.

   PAC Contributions to Senators Totaled
   $96.3 Million in '83-'88, Group Says

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. senators collectively received $96.3
million in campaign contributions from political action
committees sponsored by corporations and labor unions in a
recent six-year period, according to a study by Common Cause.
   The study, released the same week the Senate is expected
to begin debating ways to overhaul the campaign-finance
system, showed that 44 senators received more than $1 million
each from PACs during 1983-1988, the period studied by the
self-styled citizens lobby group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Senate's leader in PAC contributions was Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, who received $2.5 million. Three other senators --
Pete Wilson (R., Calif.), Slade Gorton (R., Wash.) and Phil
Gramm (R., Texas) -- also received more than $2 million from
PACs.
   "Special-interest PACs have contributed tens of millions
of dollars to obtain special access and influence," said
Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer.
   Financial-services industry PACs, including those
sponsored by savings and loan associations, were the biggest
corporate contributors, giving senators more than $8.5
million. Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich),
the subject of an ethics inquiry because of large
contributions he received from savings and loan executive
Charles Keating, was the Senate's top recipient from such
PACs, with $344,133.
   The second highest recipient from financial industry PACs
was Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), who received $309,433.
Sen. D'Amato is the subject of a Senate ethics inquiry that
focuses in part on campaign contributions he received from
executives of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Sen. Alan Cranston
(D., Calif.), also under investigation for his ties to Mr.
Keating, received $209,195 from financial-industry PACS and
ranked ninth among beneficiaries of such groups.
   PACs representing oil and gas companies, utilities and
other energy interests gave senators more than $7 million.
Sen. Gramm was the top recipient with $382,103. The Texas
Republican also led in PAC contributions from real estate and
construction industry PACs, which gave him $193,874 out of a
total of $4.8 million contributed to senators.
   Insurance industry PACs gave a total of $45.7 million.
Sen. Bentsen was their top recipient with $213,900. PACs
representing food, restaurant and liquor associations gave a
total of $4.5 million; Sen. Gorton led with $147,182. Medical
and health industry PACs gave nearly $4 million, with Sen.
Dave Durenberger (R., Minn.) the top recipient with $156,061.
Pro-Israel PACs contributed $4.9 million and gave their
largest contributions to Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.) who
received $297,786.
   PACs sponsored by labor unions gave more than $14 million
to senators. Their top beneficiary was Sen. Thomas Daschle
(D., S.D.), who received $510,999 from such PACs in the
six-year period.
   Under current law, Senate candidates may receive a
contribution of up to $5,000 from any PAC in a primary
election and the same amount in a general election. There is
no overall ceiling on the amount of money a candidate can
receive from various PACs.
   Proposals to limit the role played by PACS are among the
most contentious items in the highly partisan fight over
campaign-finance. With seven senators facing pending ethics
inquiries, the Senate is under intense pressure to reduce the
role of special-interest money in politics, but lawmakers are
split over how to do so.
   Historically, Democrats have enjoyed higher levels of PAC
support and have been less cordial to proposals to limit
them. However, a bill introduced last month by Sen. David
Boren (D., Okla.) would place an aggregate ceiling on the
amount of PAC money a Senate candidate can receive. President
Bush has proposed changes that would, in effect, abolish
corporate and labor PACs, while other Republicans advocate
lowering the contribution limits from $5,000 to $1,000.
   Steven Stockmeyer, who represents a coalition of business
PACs, opposes all such proposals. "PACS are as diverse as
America is," he says. "To artificially limit them limits that
diversity."

   Interest rate fears continued to batter stock prices,
though bond prices declined only modestly.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 29.28 points to
2666.67 in light trading. Long-term bond prices lost about a
quarter of a point, or about $2.50 for each $1,000 of face
amount. Though small, the decline was the seventh consecutive
drop. The dollar rose sharply against the West German mark,
but much less markedly against the Japanese yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said the decline in stocks was a continuation of
the inflation and interest rate worries that pushed the Dow
Jones Industrial Average down nearly 56 points last week to
its lowest level in more than a month.
   Last week's market activity was led by the bond market,
where investors bid prices down sharply. As bond prices fell,
the interest rates on those securities rose, posing a threat
to already sluggish economic growth and giving investors an
attractive alternative to stocks. Although the bond price
decline moderated considerably yesterday, analysts said the
likelihood of further rate increases, including the
possibility that the Federal Reserve might soon push
short-term rates higher, continued to frighten investors away
from stocks.
   There also are worries that Japanese investors will be
assuming a much lower profile in the U.S. bond market in
coming months, a development that also could drive interest
rates higher. James Solloway, chief economist at Argus
Research in New York, noted that while Japanese investors
aren't the largest block of bondholders in the market, they
are influential. And with interest rates in Japan approaching
7.25%, the real returns available to them in Japan are about
as good as they are here without the currency risk of
investing in dollar-denominated securities.
   Mr. Solloway, contending stocks already are overvalued at
current interest rates, said there is likely to be a
psychological reaction among investors if the yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rises to 9%. The yield is
at 8.96%.
   "It's very difficult for stocks to beat a 9% yield on a
long-term basis," said Mr. Solloway. He suggests that stock
prices could tumble 10% to 15% if interest rates rise much
further.
   The dollar's rise against the West German mark followed
published reports that German monetary union will include a
one-to-one exchange rate for the bulk of East German savings
as well as wages and pensions. Currency traders said a broad
one-to-one exchange rate between the two Germanies'
currencies would be inflationary. The West German Bundesbank
has said it opposes a one-to-one exchange rate and central
bank officials have threatened to drive interest rates higher
if such an exchange rate is approved.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices sank in light trading. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 136.2 million shares. Declining issues
on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 1229 to 328.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices eased. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
issue rose to 8.96%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar strengthened against most major currencies. In
late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.6996 marks
and 157.60 yen compared with 1.6995 marks and 157.45 yen
Friday.

   NEW YORK -- Jefferies Group Inc., after hiring a flock of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s junk-bond traders in
California, is urging the rest of its "junk" staff here to
move to the city that made Drexel famous: Beverly Hills.
   The Los Angeles brokerage firm is quietly urging its
junk-bond professionals to leave New York for the California
city, where a junk-bond universe was built by Drexel's former
junk-bond chief Michael Milken.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move will help ensure that the former Drexel traders
will feel at home and more easily retain their clients,
traders said. That's especially important at a time when the
junk market has contracted sharply and Drexel's junk
professionals are filtering throughout Wall Street and
elsewhere.
   Jefferies officials, for their part, sought to play down
the shift. "We have an open speaker system" throughout
Jefferies offices nationwide, says Frank Baxter, chief
executive officer. "Where someone is located isn't really
that important." Jefferies's equity operations in New York
won't be affected by the shift.
   Although some of Jefferies's junk-bond professionals "are
mutually considering whether they'd like to move West," Mr.
Baxter adds, he says there are no "present plans" to purge
their entire New York-based junk operations.
   The shift began several weeks ago, when Jefferies hired
seven former Drexel junk professionals -- nearly doubling the
size of its junk-bond staff, previously centered in New York,
in one fell swoop. As part of a negotiated deal, some traders
said, Jefferies promised the former Drexel executives that
they could stay in California.
   Since then, the firm's junk-bond professionals have been
reporting to David Sydorick, one of the former Drexel
salesmen who is based in Beverly Hills. And Ronald Davis,
former head of the firm's New York junk-bond group, already
has moved to the firm's Dallas office.
   Jefferies isn't the first brokerage firm to urge some of
its junk-bond staff to look West. Last year, Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. had sought new offices for its growing junk operations in
Beverly Hills but has since decided to keep its junk-bond
trading desk in New York. Jefferies says it plans to
eventually shift its staff to the Westwood section of Los
Angeles.
   Meantime, a former Drexel junk-bond trader who lives in
California and recently moved to Jefferies concedes, "There's
no good business reason to be in California and not be part
of the Wall Street community." But, he adds, the former
Drexel employees all live in California and will easily fit
in at Jefferies.
   Besides, he says, "All we need is a telephone."

   The closest thing this country has to a national
referendum is a box on everyone's 1040 IRS form. Since 1973
filers have been asked if they wanted $1 of their taxes to go
to a presidential-election fund. Though they are explicitly
told that checking "yes" won't raise their taxes, the number
of people who want to subsidize White House aspirants is
obviously diminishing. It fell from 29% in 1980 to 20% last
year. Despite this overwhelming rejection, Washington is
overflowing with proposals at the moment to extend public
financing to Congress. Not surprisingly, no one is even
suggesting that the money be raised by giving taxpayers a
"vote" on the matter with a checkoff system for congressional
elections. The results would likely be embarrassing.

   Bank of New England Names McNamar,
   Ex-Treasury Aide, to Be Vice Chairman

   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. named R.T. McNamar, a
former U.S. deputy Treasury secretary, as vice chairman.
   Mr. McNamar, 51 years old, will be responsible for
regulatory compliance, investor relations and corporate
communications at the financially troubled bank holding
company. The vice chairman's post had been vacant since the
end of January, when Richard Driscoll was forced to retire.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McNamar will play a sensitive role. Bank of New
England is under strict orders from federal regulators to
improve its financial condition and its operations. And the
company's securities holders are watching anxiously to see
whether it can work its way out from under its massive loan
problems without government assistance. Any financial aid
from the government would probably wipe out any remaining
value in the company's shares and could mean big losses for
debt holders, as well.
   Mr. McNamar said in an interview that he sees "a
reasonable possibility that we can avoid" government
assistance. But he said it "will take another quarter or two"
of monitoring the Bank of New England loan portfolio before
the question of the company's viability can be answered with
greater assurance. Mr. McNamar said that he is "very
impressed" with the new loan-review process at Bank of New
England, but that the system will have to be checked against
factors such as rates of recovery on foreclosed real estate.
   First-quarter results are to be posted in the next couple
of weeks, and Lawrence Fish, the company's new chairman, has
warned that nonperforming assets will rise from the $2.3
billion reported as of Dec. 31, partly resulting from
deterioration in the New England real estate market and
partly reflecting the revised loan-review process.
Nonperforming assets include foreclosed loans and loans for
which payments are past due or considered to become
delinquent. Mr. Fish last week outlined a strategy to return
the company to profitability, and said the bank will seek to
place some of its problem assets in a separate entity --
often known as a "bad bank."
   Mr. McNamar and Mr. Fish became acquainted after Mr. Fish
left Bank of Boston Corp. in 1988 to become president and
chief operating officer of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association in Beverly Hills, Calif. The two men met at the
suggestion of an executive recruiter they both knew in San
Francisco, and have kept in touch since, Mr. McNamar said.
   Mr. McNamar held the No. 2 job at the Treasury Department
from 1981 to 1985, and was responsible for domestic and
international capital markets, banking and tax policy. He was
in charge of the department's handling of the Third World
debt problem and served as principal negotiator for some
assistance packages from 1982 to 1984.
   Since leaving the government, he has run Conover &amp;
McNamar, a Los Angeles-based consulting and merchant banking
firm that did work for the World Bank and several private
banking companies. Co-founder C. Todd Conover, formerly U.S.
comptroller of the currency, has since left the firm. Mr.
McNamar, who started work at Bank of New England yesterday,
said Conover &amp; McNamar will be closed.
   Mr. McNamar, who joins the boards of Bank of New England
Corp. and its main banking affiliates in Massachusetts and
Connecticut, will have a personal financial stake in the
company's efforts to turn itself around: His compensation
package at Bank of New England, like Mr. Fish's, includes a
heavy weighting of stock options.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bank of New England shares closed at $3.625, unchanged.

   The weekend release of hostage Robert Polhill may signal
that the Western allies can begin discussing in public again
their long-term strategic no longer of much benefit to the
Syrians and Iranians, and may in fact be a liability. With
diminishing Soviet support, and with the pullback of the East
Germans and the Romanians, Syria is now more vulnerable than
it was.
   Within the context of a post-Khomeini Iran, moderates do
exist. The Ayatollah took hostages in part to empty the Arab
world of Westerners. He was uninterested in economics, or in
economic benefits that come with Western activity. But his
successor, President Hashemi Rafsanjani, knows that domestic
turmoil is probable if he can't reverse Iran's economic
slide.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With inflation about 60% and a 25% unemployment level,
Iran is engaged in a process of economic reform. Mr.
Rafsanjani has imposed domestic austerity, trying to restore
monetary discipline that was lost during the Iran-Iraq war.
Last October, Mr. Rafsanjani announced that Iran would
encourage foreign trade, and would embark on at least a
limited privatization campaign. Efforts to sell state-owned
mines have faltered, mostly because buyers can't be sure of
reliable electricity supplies. But private Iranian firms now
have permission to strike deals with Western counterparts.
   Iran's interest is foreign exchange, without which a
nation today simply disintegrates. Mr. Rafsanjani has said
that the country will likely borrow $27 billion as part of an
effort to boost non-oil sectors. The success of that effort
depends on Western predilections. Western nations need not
betray the bedrock no-deal-with-terrorists policy to advance
whatever inclinations exist inside Iran to establish a modus
vivendi with the West. If Iran's moderation is genuine, the
hostages will be released, though it could take time.
   Any progress with Iran also might have a bracing effect on
Iraq, which has emerged as one of the world's more dangerous
nations. This is a country willing to use poison gas on its
opponents, and as reports in recent days indicate, Iraq has
been trying to develop a "super gun" capable of throwing
chemical or nuclear warheads at its neighbors.
   These seem to be days when decades of steadfastness are
paying off. Western anti-communism has paid dividends in
Eastern Europe, but also in the Middle East, where the
collapse of bankrolling Communist governments may force the
Syrians to moderate. A steadfast unwillingness to do business
with terrorists means that nations that practice hostage
taking will have to change if they expect Western economic
cooperation.
   As always, politics are treacherous in the Middle East,
and progress may be quickly reversed. But Mr. Polhill's
release is reason to hope that the politics of Iran may yet
be headed in the right direction.

   Electric Reduces

   PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia Electric Co. slashed its
quarterly common stock dividend 45% and announced an
aggressive $100 million cost-cutting program to offset a rate
increase that was disallowed by state regulators last week.
   The company also reported a first-quarter net loss of $60
million, or 40 cents a share. The loss was caused primarily
by a one-time charge of $250 million, or $1.18 a share. The
charge stems from various investments disallowed by the
Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The quarterly dividend was cut to 30 cents a share from 55
cents. The utility's management had been warning investors
for more than a year that a dividend cut was likely if the
company didn't receive the $549 million rate increase it had
requested to recoup its investment in building and operating
its Limerick No. 2 nuclear power station.
   Yet Philadelphia Electric shares fell 75 cents to $15.75
as more than 1.1 million shares changed hands in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   Doris Kelley Aloston at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said the new
lower dividend "is secure. It {Philadelphia Electric} can
manage to pay it long term."
   Daniel Scotto, a bond analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp., said the dividend cut should save
the company about $208 million annually. He estimated that
such savings should pump up the company's cash flow, which is
good news for Philadelphia Electric's bondholders. Mr. Scotto
upgraded his bond rating on the utility after the dividend
cut and cost-reduction program were announced.
   Joseph F. Paquette Jr., Philadelphia Electric's chairman
and chief executive officer, said the company believes it can
achieve the proposed $100 million in expense cuts without
having to lay off non-management employees or cut their
salaries. However, the company's top 70 to 80 executives
won't be spared. Their salaries will be cut between 2% to
10%, including a 10% pay cut for Mr. Paquette. The retainer
fee for directors also will be reduced by 10%.
   Philadelphia Electric plans to reduce staff through an
early-retirement plan and by cutting back on contract
workers. Mr. Paquette said some $70 million to $80 million of
its cost-reduction plan will come from labor savings. The
rest should be achieved through more efficient purchasing
practices. The company also plans to reduce its capital
spending, but it hasn't targeted specific areas yet.
   Mr. Paquette said a second phase of the cost-cutting
program, which the company will undertake probably in early
1992, will entail an analysis of its work activity to find
various tasks that can be reorganized or consolidated,
allowing the utility to reduce workers without sacrificing
productivity or service. Philadelphia Electric doesn't have
an estimate on the savings it'll achieve under the second
phase.

   Time Warner Posts Loss of $51 Million
   For Quarter, Cities Costs Tied to Merger

   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. reported a first-quarter net
loss of $51 million, or $3.25 a common share, after preferred
dividends, because of interest expense and the amortization
of the purchase cost related to Time's acquisition of Warner
Communications Inc.
   However, the company said earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization were a record $536 million.
Time Warner, like other heavily leveraged media and cable
television companies, has been attempting to persuade Wall
Street to value it using that measure of its cash flow,
instead of on the more traditional earnings-based valuations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the financial results released today, Time Warner
presented its 1989 figures on a historical and a pro forma
basis. Assuming the purchase of 100% of Warner as of Jan. 1,
1989, earnings for the quarter ended March 31 before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the
company's operating units increased 16% to $536 million from
$461 million a year earlier. Revenue climbed 7.9% to $2.74
billion from $2.54 billion.
   J. Richard Munro and Steven J. Ross, co-chairmen of Time
Warner, said in a statement that each of the company's
businesses "produced outstanding results, with five of our
six divisions setting new records."
   On a pro forma basis, magazine division earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first
quarter dropped to $54 million from $70 million in the 1989
period. Time Warner said that, as expected, the start-up
costs of Entertainment Weekly hurt magazine results. A softer
advertising environment, primarily in automotive and tobacco,
was responsible for a decline in advertising revenue, while
circulation revenue rose modestly, the company said.
   Also on a pro forma basis, first-quarter earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from Time
Warner's filmed entertainment division was a record $92
million, up 35% from its previous high of $68 million posted
last year. Led by "Driving Miss Daisy," which won four
Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actress,
Warner Bros.' domestic theatrical revenues were especially
strong. "Driving Miss Daisy" has to date topped the $93
million mark at the box office. First-quarter results were
also boosted by strong revenues in foreign theatrical
distribution and record world-wide home video sales.
   In the recorded-music and music-publishing division,
meanwhile, pro forma earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization rose 12% to a record $149
million on strong international sales. World-wide
compact-disk sales volume grew 24% in the quarter.
   The cable-television division's first-quarter pro forma
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 29% to a record $179 million. The
programming division, which includes Home Box Office, was
almost flat for the quarter, with earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of $45 million. Included
in the 1990 results are start-up expenses associated with The
Comedy Channel, which may be merged with rival Viacom Inc.'s
Ha] Channel if current talks between the two companies reach
fruition.
   The books division's pro forma earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization more than doubled to $17
million from $7 million a year earlier.

   Contenders in November's Senate Races Devise
   Some New Dance Steps to the Same Old Tunes

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Earlier this month, Democratic Sen. Paul
Simon, regarded as one of the strongest congressional
supporters of the environment, voted against the Clean-Air
Bill. At the same time, GOP Rep. Lynn Martin, seldom counted
as an ardent backer of environmental legislation, said she
would support the bill in the House.
   The election shuffle is on -- and the two Illinois
lawmakers, opponents in one of this year's fiercest Senate
races, aren't the only ones moving around the floor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, for example,
showed virtually no interest in health-care issues for the
first five years of his term. But once Democratic challenger
Harvey Sloane, a physician, signaled that he would make
health the centerpiece of his campaign, Sen. McConnell rushed
out a comprehensive health-care proposal of his own that
would cost $21 billion over five years.
   Voters in 35 states will cast ballots in Senate elections
this fall, and though it's unlikely a substantial shift will
occur in the 55-45 advantage the Democrats held until
Democratic Sen. Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii died this month,
lawmakers have begun to position themselves for the November
elections.
   Not all the positioning is as visible as Mr. Simon's vote
against the Clean-Air Bill or Mr. McConnell's effort to
outflank his opponent on health care. Lawmakers know they can
sculpt their political profiles more deftly with a chisel
than with a jackhammer, and often the adjustments they make
are subtle and unobtrusive.
   "A vote here and a vote there can really help," says
Richard Fenno, a University of Rochester specialist on
Congress. "A senator knows what his constituency looks like,
and the closer he gets to Election Day, the more he can
anticipate what he'll face back home. A few votes one way or
the other can help a senator move off the extremes and help
him at home."
   Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa, for example, was rated the
most liberal member of the Senate in 1988 by the National
Journal, which over the past decade developed a rating system
for floor votes. But in 1989, the last year for which such
ratings would be available to voters contemplating their
decisions in November, Mr. Harkin didn't even rank among the
20 most liberal lawmakers in the Senate. At the same time,
Republican Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, the most
conservative member of the Senate in 1988 in the National
Journal ratings, ranked roughly in the middle of Senate
Republicans in 1989 as he prepared for this year's election
battle.
   The phenomenon is repeated again and again. Democratic
Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, for example, more than doubled
his score in ratings compiled between 1988 and 1989 by the
National Taxpayers Union, which seeks to identify lawmakers
who it says protect the taxpayers' dollars. He also ran up a
substantial improvement between 1982 and 1983 as he prepared
for his re-election battle in 1984.
   "Democratic senators who rack up scores as big spenders
tend to significantly change in the year prior to their
re-election," says Marshall Taylor, communications director
for the taxpayers' group. "They become more fiscally
conservative. It's a remarkable pattern."
   Sometimes lawmakers who make striking departures from
their record manage not to alienate their old allies. Sen.
Simon, despite being only one of five Democrats to oppose the
clean-air legislation (Sen. Alan Dixon, his Illinois
colleague, was another), hasn't relinquished the support of
environmentalists. The bill, says Ali Webb, communications
director for the League of Conservation Voters, was
"something that would cost him too much at home."
   Mr. Simon voted with the environmentalists on all the
amendments to strengthen the legislation, such as reducing
emissions from new cars and requiring an alternative-fuels
program for the dirtiest cities. He balked only at final
passage, citing the potential loss of 18,000 coal-related
jobs in Illinois and the prospect that utility rates in the
state might rise as much as 25%.
   "The bill is not fair to utility payers and coal miners in
Illinois," Mr. Simon says now. "I'm for a clean-air bill, but
I have to be fair to my region."
   Rep. Martin was swift to assail Sen. Simon for his vote.
"I think it's time for this kind of legislation," she says.
But the Sierra Club branded her a "Jill-come-lately." Reid
Wilson, the group's political director, says, "He's been a
consistent ally, and she has been a frequent opponent."
   Sen. McConnell, meanwhile, has raised eyebrows with his
costly health plan. "McConnell has not been particularly
outspoken on health issues," says Grady Stumbo, a Democrat
who is a former Kentucky state secretary of human resources.
"There's no question that this is an effort to go through the
gate first on an issue that one of his opponents is going to
raise." Moreover, Carl Schramm, president of the Health
Insurance Association of America and a prominent figure in
health-care planning circles, says "there isn't much appetite
in Washington today for comprehensive health-care plans." He
sees no prospect for the McConnell proposal, saying, "The
last thing Congress wants to do is move on this."
   Former GOP Rep. Hal Daub, who is challenging Democratic
Sen. James Exon of Nebraska, gambled when he vowed not to
accept any money from political-action committess, or PACs.
"The influence was mounting in a corrupting way," he says.
"This has to stop, and politicians have to have the courage
to stand up and say we can do it differently."
   But Mr. Daub received $923,172 from PACs between 1979 and
1988, according to Common Cause. In 1984 he answered an
opponent's argument that PACs were a corrosive influence in
politics by saying he doubted "that there is a more phony
issue." And a year ago, he contributed to the PAC run by
Deloitte &amp; Touche, a big accounting firm where he works as
director of governmental affairs.
   Today his 1984 opponent, Tom Cavanaugh, now the Douglas
County clerk, calls Mr. Daub "a great chameleon," and Robert
Spire, the state's Republican attorney general, says Mr.
Daub's decision was "politically motivated" but probably
shrewd.
   In all, the Democrats have to defend 16 seats, the
Republicans 15, and four seats are open because of
retirements and death.
   "There are a lot of tough races out there, but we think
we're in a good position to hold the 55 seats to go into
1992," says Anita Dunn, communications director for the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The Democrats want
to consolidate their hold to prepare for the 1992 elections,
when they will defend a minimum of 20 Senate seats, including
11 freshmen, most of whom won by less than 55% of the vote in
the non-presidential election year of 1986.
   The tightest race may be in Iowa, where Sen. Harkin is
trying to fend off a challenge from GOP Rep. Tom Tauke.
Another incumbent facing a tough challenge is Democrat
Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, who is running against GOP
Rep. Claudine Schneider.
   Louisiana Republicans, meanwhile, are seeking to focus
attention on state Sen. Ben Bagert, who is challenging
incumbent Democrat Bennett Johnston. They also are trying to
divert attention from state Rep. David Duke, a former Ku Klux
Klan leader who wants the seat. Republican leaders are hoping
Mr. Duke's high profile won't translate into votes and are
dismissing him, as Republican Senatorial Campaign Commitee
communications director Wendy DeMocker puts it, as little
more than "a curiosity who puts on an interesting show."

   Law:
   Plea Bargains Must Balance Rewards
   Vs. Risks in Settlements Such as Milken's

<LP>
   After all the buildup, the government's case against
Michael R. Milken is scheduled to end today with a plea
bargain.
   But as the government prepares to drop most of its 98
charges against the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
junk-bond chief and to scrap a broader new indictment, a
question looms large: Do plea bargains serve the public's
interest in learning the full scope of alleged crimes and
seeing justice done?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plea bargain in this case will make the extraordinary
Mr. Milken quite ordinary by courtroom standards: More than
90% of all criminal defendants plead guilty to lesser charges
to avoid facing trial.
   And regular participants in the justice system seem to
like things that way. For prosecutors, says Benito Romano, a
former U.S. attorney in New York, plea bargaining "is an
effort to spare the expenditure of precious resources --
courtrooms, prosecutors and judges -- and still achieve a
disposition that does justice."
   For defendants, pleas eliminate the risks of trials,
narrow the charges and generally result in shorter prison
terms than a judge would mete out after a conviction at
trial. "Plea bargaining is really a way to resolve conflict
in a way where you can contain and better control the
consequences of a conviction," says New York defense lawyer
Stanley Arkin.
   Although criminal cases are typically described as "The
People" vs. such-and-such defendant, many prosecutors and
defense lawyers minimize the significance of the public's
interest and say that general curiosity about the details of
an investigation shouldn't bear on whether a plea bargain is
struck.
   "The public clearly has an interest in what the facts are
of investigations and the right to know whether prosecutors
are doing their job," says Aaron Marcu, a former prosecutor
in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office who is now a defense
lawyer. But Mr. Marcu says the public shouldn't have a voice
in deciding whether a particular case ought to end in a plea
bargain because "the public doesn't usually know all the
facts, and it has entrusted these decisions to prosecutors."
   Adds Mr. Romano, "The rights of the individual defendant
are more important" than the interest of the public.
   That's not a view that sits easily with some critics.
"What is the point of the taxpayers having spent millions of
dollars investigating cases if the material the government
uncovers is then to be swept under the rug?" asks Benjamin J.
Stein, a Los Angeles attorney and economist who is a longtime
critic of the government's handling of insider-trading
issues. "It's in the constitution that trials should be
open." A regular contributor to Dow Jones &amp; Co.'s Barron's,
Mr. Stein's open letter opposing a plea bargain in the Milken
case appeared in the magazine this week.
   "If I had my way, I'd have everyone go to trial," says New
York defense lawyer Bruce Cutler, who represents John Gotti
and others whom the government has called alleged mobsters.
"Pleas help the system along, and I'm not in favor of doing
that. I believe the government ought to try its cases, so I'm
in favor of fighting."
   Critics argue that plea bargains often create the false
impression that a defendant committed only the crimes to
which he agreed to plead guilty. In fact, plea bargains are
negotiated compromises and defendants usually plead guilty to
fewer crimes than the government believes they committed or
to lesser charges.
   Often, the government attempts to combat the impression
that the defendant committed only a few minor offenses by
unveiling details of additional allegations in sentencing
memos that are presented to the judge. The thinking is that
the judge -- and the public -- should be aware that the
government was prepared to bring broader charges against the
defendant if he had refused the plea agreement.
   This effort to shape the public perception of a
prosecution spawned a heated dispute in the government's
recent case against Robert Freeman. The former head of
arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. had been arrested in a
highly publicized incident, amid indications from the
government that he had been involved in a huge
insider-trading scandal. But Mr. Freeman ultimately pleaded
guilty last year to one felony count of using inside
information under circumstances that made his crime appear to
some to be of little significance.
   In an effort to dispel that impression and give the judge
an idea of the potentially broader charges that might have
been brought, the government alleged in a sentencing memo
that Mr. Freeman committed some 20 other similar crimes. But
the judge ruled in that case -- at the request of Mr.
Freeman's lawyers -- that he wouldn't consider or release the
additional allegations in sentencing Mr. Freeman. The judge
said he wanted to avoid a lengthy hearing in which each
charge would have to be debated.
   Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan
decline to comment on why they were willing to strike a plea
bargain with Mr. Milken, who was charged last year with 98
counts of racketeering and securities and tax fraud. (His
deal requires him to plead guilty to six felony counts, none
of them involving racketeering or insider trading.)
   But prosecutors and defense lawyers not involved in the
case say that while the government won't be able to show a
somewhat skeptical public that it had a broad and
well-documented case against Mr. Milken, the benefits of
accepting his plea outweigh the risks of public criticism.
   "Here's a man who's been saying for four years he was
innocent and now he's agreeing to plead to six felony
counts," says Washington, D.C., defense lawyer Harvey Pitt,
who represented stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky in his
insider trading-related plea bargain in 1986.
   Mr. Pitt says Mr. Milken's plea "is an admission of guilt
that vindicates the whole prosecutorial effort here." He adds
that the plea sends out a sign to future defendants that the
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office "is an office to be reckoned
with."
   Additionally, prosecutors benefit from the Milken plea
bargain by avoiding the expense and inherent risk of going to
trial against a defendant with nearly unlimited resources and
a powerful legal team. A trial could have dragged on for
years, and even if Mr. Milken had been convicted, he probably
would have appealed.
   It might have taken the government many years to get the
hundreds of millions of dollars of fines and restitution it
sought. The plea agreement ensures instead that the
government will quickly get the $600 million Mr. Milken
promised to deliver.
   On a more personal level, prosecutors who have been
working on the case for nearly four years have made it clear
that they would like to leave their relatively low-paying
public jobs for lucrative partnerships at private law firms.
While such considerations may not have been paramount, they
were no doubt a factor, many current and former prosecutors
agree.
   Few plea bargains in cases of this magnitude get made,
however, unless the defendant agrees to cooperate with the
government in taking its investigation further. Often, the
government will use plea bargains to turn defendants into
witnesses in cases it is trying to build against more
prominent targets.
   The Milken plea bargain, too, requires him to cooperate.
But for several years it has appeared that Mr. Milken was the
government's prime target in its insider-trading
investigation. So the question will be raised whether the big
case -- the one against the master of the junk-bond market --
should have gone to trial.
   Indeed, Mr. Milken himself had always made clear that he
wanted the government to have to prove its charges publicly
in a trial by jury. But even he succumbed to the lure of a
compromise.
   By pleading guilty, Mr. Milken avoids a drawn-out legal
battle and the risk of a conviction on racketeering charges,
which carry maximum prison terms of up to 20 years. He also
gets to serve his time immediately and get on with his life
more quickly than if he first had to face a trial and an
appeal.
   Moreover, by accepting a deal, Mr. Milken avoids the
further barrage of media attention that a trial would surely
bring. And his plea bargain makes it less likely that the
public will ever know precisely what he did wrong -- and why
he became the target of the largest securities fraud
investigation ever.

   Plum Creek Expects
   To Post Profit Rise

<LP>
   SEATTLE -- Plum Creek Timber Co. L.P. said a brisk price
rise for raw logs pushed first-quarter net income up to about
80 cents a share, from 75 cents in the year-earlier period.
   The forest products limited partnership expects to report
that revenue grew about 17% to $90 million from $77 million a
year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said 1990 first-quarter profit was damped by
depreciation costs, amounting to about 40 cents a share,
related to its spinoff from Burlington Resources Inc. last
June. Minus those costs, Plum Creek's first-quarter profit
would have improved about 30%, said Rick R. Holley, the
company's chief financial officer.
   Burlington Resources, a Seattle-based energy and natural
resources concern, still holds about 1.25 million, or 8%, of
Plum Creek's 15.6 million publicly traded partnership units.
   David D. Leland, Plum Creek Timber's president and chief
executive officer, said in an interview that market forces
which pushed up the company's first-quarter profit should
also position the company favorably in coming quarters. Mr.
Leland said prices for both exported and domestic logs were
up 30% from the year-earlier quarter, largely owing to a
diminished supply of harvestable timber from the Pacific
Northwest's federal forests.
   The harvest and sale of raw logs amount to about 40% of
Plum Creek's revenue; the company, moreover, is the
second-largest private timberland owner in the Pacific
Northwest, with holdings of about 1.4 million acres. Thus it
has been able to harvest a steady source of timber at a time
when prices continue to increase -- a trend that Leland sees
continuing.

   TORONTO -- Stelco Inc. posted a first-quarter loss of 13.3
million Canadian dollars (US$11.4 million), as revenue fell
13% because of the downturn in the auto industry, the strong
Canadian dollar and increased imports of steel into Canada.
   Separately, the steelmaker said Fred Telmer, president of
the company's Stelco Steel division, will succeed John D.
Allan as the company's chairman and chief executive officer
at the end of this year; Mr. Allan said previously that he
intended to retire this year.

<TEXT>
   Stelco's per-share loss was 48 Canadian cents (41 U.S.
cents) in the latest period. A year ago, the company had net
income of C$32.7 million, or 83 Canadian cents a share. Sales
fell to C$638.9 million from C$737.5 million.
   The company said it plans a two-year cost-cutting program,
in which Stelco will shut several small plants, sell surplus
properties, reduce capital spending, and cut 800 jobs from
its 16,000-member work force.
   Stelco has spent heavily recently to build up inventory in
anticipation of a 90-day maintenance shutdown planned for one
of its blast furnaces in the year's third quarter.
   Mr. Telmer said the company won't have to go to the debt
or equity markets for additional financing this year.
   Mr. Telmer said Stelco will be able to meet liquidity
problems by selling about C$300 million of its C$900 million
in inventory by the end of 1991.
   Jay M. Gordon, an analyst with McLean McCarthy Ltd., said
it's unlikely the company will be able to sell the C$300
million. "If the markets are working as they are, {Stelco}
might find that it's going to take them a lot longer to sell
the steel," he said.
   Mr. Gordon said the company will have to seek out some
short-term funding to meet this year's obligations. Stelco,
which has bank credit lines of C$300 million, has said
previously that it might have to rely on the banks to get it
through its "temporary cash situation."
   In November, the company raised C$125 million through the
issue of debentures to help finance inventory costs.
   Analysts are concerned about the company's high debt level
and say Stelco will suffer from high interest payments this
year. Stelco said it currently has C$860 million in long-term
debt.
   Mr. Gordon said there's not much encouragement in the job
cuts either, which he said were expected. "There's probably
not a lot of fat left" on Stelco, he said. "I frankly don't
think they have that many people left to {cut}."
   Mr. Telmer said the company plans capital spending of
about C$200 million this year, little changed from last year.
He said most of the money will go to previously announced
projects, including C$100 million for the blast furnace work.
   Spending after 1990 will be cut to a maintenance level for
five years. "It will be tailored to just really keeping our
facilities current," Mr. Telmer said.
   Savings from the job reductions over the next two years
will amount to about C$43.2 million, with an additional C$50
million in savings from the sale of properties, the company
said.
   On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Stelco Class A
fell 37.5 Canadian cents to C$17.50.

   LONDON -- SmithKline Beecham PLC agreed to alter its
partnership agreements with Nova Pharmaceutical Corp., giving
Nova the option to keep nearly all its potential drugs to
itself but canceling a future investment by SmithKline.
   The agreements, first reached in 1988, originally involved
SmithKline Beckman Corp., which at the time was looking for
ways to expand its interest in drugs for disorders of the
central nervous system. Last year, however, SmithKline
Beckman merged with Beecham Group PLC, which already had its
own research program in that field.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the revised agreements, Nova, a biotechnology
company in Baltimore, will reacquire the rights to most of
its central nervous system research projects. SmithKline will
cancel a $24 million investment in the partnership previously
due in 1992.
   Nova also has the option to reacquire rights to its
bradykinin antagonists, a drug class the company hopes to
develop into pain killers and cold and allergy remedies.
   SmithKline will retain an option to co-develop and
co-market a class of drugs for treating anxiety and
depression, unless Nova fulfills certain conditions while
buying back as many as 2.7 million Nova shares owned by
SmithKline. SmithKline will also put its psychiatric product
line into the revised partnership involving central nervous
system drugs. Nova's stake in the partnership will rise to
60% from 40%.

   Pansophic Is Planning
   Charges Eliminating

   LISLE, Ill. -- Pansophic Systems Inc. disclosed it plans
special charges that it expects will effectively erase its
earnings for the year ending Monday. The news sent the
software concern's stock price plunging 33%.
   While Pansophic didn't break out the size of the charges,
its statement that it now expects break-even results for the
full year indicates the charges will about wipe out the $15.7
million, or 84 cents a share, in earnings in the first nine
months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pansophic said it will write down certain assets of its
graphics operation and incur other one-time costs as part of
a plan to "refocus" the operation on its core
presentation-graphics business.
   In addition, the company said it is closing its Brazilian
subsidiary, because recent economic austerity measures
announced by that nation have created an "untenable
environment" for direct sales there. Pansophic will continue
to sell in Brazil through a distributor.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Pansophic shares plunged $5.125, closing at $10.50.
   A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. analyst David Soetebier said he
thinks the "sell-off was overdone," adding that the "core of
the company is still quite strong." The disclosure of the
Brazilian unit's shutdown came as a surprise, he noted. "Part
of the problem with Pansophic in the last couple of years,"
he said, is that management hasn't moved to resolve problems
"as quickly as they should have."
   Pansophic also announced that its chairman and chief
executive officer, David J. Eskra, had assumed the additional
title of president, succeeding in that role William G.
Nelson, who resigned in January.

   POUGHKEEPSIE SAVINGS BANK said it would omit its
second-quarter dividend. The Poughkeepsie thrift, citing a
troubled real estate investment portfolio, also reported a
first-quarter net loss of $7.8 million, or $2.21 a share.
Poughkeepsie Savings, which operates 11 branch offices in New

quarter was $7.7 million, compared with $9.6 million a year
earlier. But latest-quarter results reflected an $8 million
increase in loan-loss reserves and a $2.9 million
stock-transaction loss. A year earlier, Poughkeepsie had a
profit of $1.9 million, or 53 cents a share. Poughkeepsie
said that the recently declared dividend of 15 cents a share
will be payable May 1. In national over-the-counter trading
yesterday, Poughkeepsie stock fell 12.5 cents to $6.125.

   NORWICH FINANCIAL Corp., citing a quarterly loss because
of problem loans, reduced its quarterly dividend 67% to five
cents a share from 15 cents. The Norwich, Conn., bank holding
company said the dividend is payable May 18 to stock of
record May 4. Norwich yesterday posted a first-quarter loss
of $14.3 million, or $2.75 a share, including a provision for
loan losses during the quarter of $16.5 million, compared
with year-earlier profit of $1.4 million, or 25 cents a
share. Norwich said its loan-loss provision reflected
"concerns over the continuing deterioration in the commercial
real estate market in Connecticut" and other factors. "In
view of the current loss, under state statute, the company is
unable to maintain a 15-cent {a share} quarterly dividend
throughout 1990 without regulatory approval," Norwich said.
The company said it expects to continue paying a quarterly
dividend of five cents a share throughout this year.

   Lesser Quits Ogilvy's New York Office

   Michael Lesser, who joined Ogilvy &amp; Mather barely a year
ago to turn around its troubled New York office, resigned as
the office's president after his yearlong turnaround effort
failed.
   Mr. Lesser will be replaced by Julian Clopet, 49 years
old, the highly regarded president and chief executive
officer of Ogilvy's Canadian operations. Mr. Clopet will take
on the larger title of president of North American
operations, but will concentrate at first on fixing the New
York office. He is a close associate of Ogilvy's world-wide
chairman and chief executive, Graham Phillips, who himself
had previously headed North American operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Lesser's resignation, which was widely expected and
will take effect June 30, followed a disappointing year. When
he joined Ogilvy from Lowe Marschalk, where he had been chief
executive, Ogilvy's New York office was in poor shape. It
hadn't won any sizable accounts in many months, and morale
was sagging. One of its largest accounts, Kraft General
Foods' $50 million Maxwell House account, was up for review.
   In the year since Mr. Lesser joined, the office hasn't
improved. Ogilvy, which was subsequently acquired by WPP
Group PLC, went on to lose the Maxwell House business. Last
month, the New York office lost the Seagram Wine Cooler
business, which had billed $15 million in 1989. It hasn't had
any significant account gains.
   Lesser, 47, made several management changes which weren't
uniformly popular. For example, he brought in creative
heavyweight Bill Hamilton from Chiat/Day/Mojo. Mr. Hamilton,
a strong-willed executive who has been attempting to spruce
up Ogilvy's creative product, was seen by some staffers as
arrogant. Mr. Hamilton declined comment, while Mr. Lesser
couldn't be reached for comment.
   "The biggest challenge Ogilvy faces is to turn around the
New York office, and to date there's no visible evidence of a
turnaround," notes Emma Hill, an analyst with Wertheim &amp; Co.
Since the New York office accounts for a large majority of
Ogilvy's U.S. business, "it's an important operation to turn
around," she says. Ogilvy's New York office has billings of
$800 million, making it larger than most entire agencies.
   Still, analysts and industry executives said Mr. Lesser
may have faced an almost impossible job in his turnaround
attempt. The New York office's slide happened over several
years, and may well take more than a year to reverse, they
said.
   "It clearly couldn't be mended in a year," said Alan
Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber. "But in less than a
year, you can probably tell if you're heading in the right
direction or not. I haven't seen any sign that they were."
   Mr. Clopet, a 23-year Ogilvy veteran, has worked closely
with Ogilvy's chairman, Mr. Phillips, for a number of years.
The two were part of a turnaround team that reversed the
fading fortunes of Ogilvy's Canadian operations in the 1970s.
   Mr. Clopet and Mr. Phillips are "a team that's worked
together before, that's had successes before. They have had a
good business as well as personal relationship," said Kenneth
Roman, former chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy, who
currently is a senior executive at Ogilvy client American
Express. Mr. Clopet "is a strong leader who's run a big
operation. I think he's an excellent choice."
   In a statement, Mr. Phillips commended Mr. Lesser on his
work at Ogilvy and said he was "sad" to see him leave. He
said Mr. Lesser was leaving because "Mike would, frankly,
prefer to do something more entrepreneurial."

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Next time you attend a meeting of the
Sierra Club, look for the big guy with the green scales.
   Godzilla has joined the environmental movement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The fabled Japanese low-budget-movie monster has been
adopted as the mascot of two San Francisco-based
environmental groups that are trying to pressure Japan into
halting lumber imports from endangered tropical rain forests.
   The groups, the Rainforest Action Network and the
International Rivers Network, point out that Godzilla
historically has been "Japan's leading environmentalist." He
merits this title because, in all of the old Godzilla movies,
he is motivated to attack and destroy cities only after
humans have messed with his habitat. He was also created by
an environmental disaster -- a nuclear explosion -- and has
to go around gobbling up nuclear power plants just to
maintain a well-balanced diet.
   This, according to Rainforest Action's Pamela Wellner,
makes him an appropriate spokesthing for conservationists
worried about what they contend is Japanese corporate
despoliation of Third World environments through logging of
tropical hardwood forests.
   "Japan's monstrous destructive capacity requires monstrous
solutions," adds Juliette Majot of the International Rivers
group. Ms. Majot and Ms. Wellner not long ago joined Godzilla
-- who looked trim and petite at a mere nine-feet tall -- in
a picket of the U.S. headquarters of Mitsubishi Corp. here. A
half-dozen large, helium-filled Godzilla look-alikes floated
menacingly above the picket lines.
   Godzilla and the human pickets accuse Mitsubishi of
conducting, through subsidiaries, 24-hour logging operations
that are destroying forests, and uprooting indigenous people,
in remote areas of Borneo.
   A Mitsubishi spokesman confirms that Godzilla made a brief
"20-minute appearance" outside the company's San Francisco
office. He declines to comment further on the monster, except
to say the issues raised by Godzilla were being addressed by
the company's environmental-affairs division in Tokyo.
   To some people, the whole affair might look like monstrous
Japan bashing. But Godzilla, in a news release, spurns such
criticism; he notes that he is Japanese himself, and in
solidarity with Japanese environmental groups, adding: "We're
not just a bunch of whining creeps out to bash Japan. It's
time to take them on."

   MIAMI -- Ryder System Inc. reported that first-quarter net
income fell 72% to $7.3 million, or seven cents a share, in
another dismal quarter for the struggling
transportation-services company.
   M. Anthony Burns, chairman and chief executive, said the
company, continued to be hurt by among other things,
sluggishness in commercial truck rentals. A year earlier
Ryder earned $26.2 million, or 31 cents a share. Revenue rose
slightly to $1.25 billion from $1.22 billion a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest results were in line with analysts' forecasts
for the company. As expected, the automotive carrier
division, crippled by the worst U.S. automobile industry
slump in a decade, reported a loss of $2.3 million, compared
with net income of $9.4 million a year earlier.
   On the aviation services side, gains in Ryder's aircraft
engine overhaul and new-parts distribution businesses were
offset by continued softness in leasing of used aircraft, and
sales of reusable aircraft parts.
   There were some bright spots, however. The company said
revenue increased in its huge Vehicle Leasing and Services
division. In addition, the company said that consumer truck
rental prices are finally stabilizing after last year's
lengthy price war with competitor U-Haul International Inc.
   This led Mr. Burns to express confidence in Ryder's
performance over the remainder of 1990. "When you look behind
the numbers, it is clear that, while demand is still soft,
the work we have been doing is bending the trends in the
right direction," he said. "We believe the March results
indicate that our comparisons will be more favorable in the
second and third quarters."

   Oat Extract
   Called New
   Fat Fighter

   BOSTON -- An extract of oat bran is being developed as a
combination low-calorie fat substitute and
cholesterol-lowering food.
   The new oat bran product, dubbed oatrim, has been used
experimentally to make an ice cream-like dessert and can be
used in a variety of room-temperature and low-temperature
foods, including yogurt, bread, cookie icing, salad dressing,
sour cream and mayonnaise, an Agriculture Department
scientist told a meeting of the American Chemical Society
here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is discussing pilot-plant
production of the product with two unnamed food processors,
George E. Inglett, a chemist with the Agricultural Research
Service laboratory in Peoria, Ill., said at a news
conference. Oatrim is being patented by the Agriculture
Department.
   At the same meeting, other researchers, including the
manager of new product research for Miller Brewing Co.,
Milwaukee, put in a strong plug for barley bran and barley
byproducts of brewing as being comparable to oat bran in
lowering blood cholesterol levels.
   A recently published study indicating that oat bran does
little to lower cholesterol levels came under fire from
several researchers at the conference, including Rosemary
Newman, professor of foods and nutrition at Montana State
University. They said the study, by researchers at Boston's
Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital, involved only volunteers with low
or normal cholesterol levels, where the effect of oat bran
isn't so pronounced as in people with high cholesterol
levels. The Boston researchers acknowledged that people with
high cholesterol may benefit more from high-fiber diets than
did the participants in their study.
   The market for fat substitutes could be huge. Oatrim can't
be used in foods that are cooked, so it would compete most
directly with Simplesse, a fat substitute from Monsanto Co.'s
NutraSweet subsidiary that also breaks down at high
temperatures. Simplesse already is used in an ice cream-like
dessert, Simple Pleasures, that NutraSweet is introducing
now. Kraft General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., is
awaiting regulatory approval for a similar fat substitute
that also can't be used in cooked foods. Olestra, a Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. fat substitute awaiting regulatory approval, does
hold up at high temperatures.
   Oatrim is made by treating oat bran with enzymes to
produce a white, tasteless flour or a powder that is rich in
compounds known as beta-glucans, the portion of oat bran
believed responsible for lowering blood cholesterol levels,
Mr. Inglett said. When heated and then allowed to cool, the
powder changes to a gel that can give foods a creamy texture
similar to that produced by saturated fats, the chemist said.
   Mr. Inglett said four ounces of an ice cream-like dessert
made with oatrim contained almost no fat, only four
milligrams of cholesterol and only 135 calories. In four
ounces of premium ice cream, there are 18 to 22 grams of fat,
85 milligrams of cholesterol and 250 to 300 calories. A taste
panel judged the oatrim dessert only slightly less sweet than
the ice cream and somewhat less creamy tasting, he reported.
   Although the product's effects on cholesterol levels
haven't yet been tested on humans, tests on newly hatched
chicks at Montana State University showed that oatrim lowered
cholesterol levels by almost 18%, with sharp reductions in
the LDL form of cholesterol, the "bad" type of cholesterol,
and moderate increases in the HDL form of cholesterol, the
form thought to provide some protection against heart
disease, according to the university's Ms. Newman.
   Mr. Inglett said 30 grams of oatrim added to an instant
breakfast drink contain about 2.5 grams of beta-glucans,
comparable to eating 100 grams of regular oat bran.
   Ms. Newman said she was "excited" about the oatrim
product, but she also reported animal and human tests showing
that barley is rich in beta-glucans and has
cholesterol-lowering properties comparable to oats. An
experiment with 22 volunteers showed both barley and oats,
added to foods as flours, reduced blood cholesterol levels by
14%.
   Miller Brewing's new product research manager, Frank E.
Weber, said the Philip Morris unit now is pushing the use of
"brewer's grain" as a cholesterol-lowering food additive.
Brewer's grain is a byproduct of the barley used in brewing,
and he said Miller produces about 200 million pounds of it a
year. Much of it has been sold traditionally for about 40
cents a pound for adding to animal feeds.
   New research, Mr. Weber said, shows that brewer's grain is
rich in tocotrienol, a chemical cousin to vitamin E.
Experiments show that 30 milligrams a day of tocotrienol,
about the amount contained in three tablespoons of brewer's
grain, can lower blood cholesterol levels by 15% in three
weeks. Miller, he said, has recently begun selling brewer's
grain to food processors for use in products such as
high-fiber breads.

   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -- Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara,
aided by a debt swap, said first-quarter net income surged
sevenfold to $37.7 million, or $1.71 a share, from a restated
$5.3 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Financial Corp. said the increase was the result of
restructuring efforts that included an equity-for-debt swap.
The swap lifted Santa Barbara Savings &amp; Loan Association, the
principle subsidiary of Financial Corp., out of insolvency,
although the S&amp;L remains significantly undercapitalized with
tangible capital of 0.6%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under last summer's thrift-rescue bill, thrifts are
required to maintain a tangible capital ratio of 1.5%
currently and of 3% by the end of 1994. Tangible capital is
the excess of real assets, excluding intangible assets such
as good will, over liabilities.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Financial Corp. stock closed at 15.625 cents, unchanged.
   In a statement, Philip R. Brinkerhoff, Financial Corp.'s
chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the
company will continue to "aggressively pursue opportunities
to increase capital, including capital infusion or sale."
   The company's restructuring efforts included a debt swap
in January that resulted in an extraordinary gain of $36.5
million and a $50 million addition to tangible capital. The
exchange offer provided for the company to issue 17 million
new common shares for preferred stock, subordinated
debentures and notes.
   The year-earlier quarter was restated to recognize a
one-time $3.2 million gain from a change in accounting
methods, Financial Corp. said. The financial-services concern
has assets of $4.3 billion.

   Commodities:
   World Oil Prices Continue to Rebound on Hopes
   That OPEC May Agree Soon to Curb Production

   A rebound in world oil prices continued on hopes of
production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   A rally that had exploded briefly last week on OPEC's
announcement of a May 2 meeting in Geneva resumed yesterday
in European trading and then spread to the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In European spot and futures trading, North Sea Brent
crudes advanced as much as 50 cents a barrel. In U.S. futures
trading, crude prices were up as much as 25 cents a barrel.
Firm crude futures helped lift other fuels as well with the
May contract for unleaded gasoline up 1.61 cents a gallon to
settle at 63.54 cents.
   "It seemed that the Brent market got the thing going,"
said William Hinton, a Stotler &amp; Co. energy futures broker.
"It was the typical pattern before an OPEC meeting," he
added, "with the market running up in anticipation of the
results."
   The major anticipated result of the meeting of OPEC's
market monitoring committee -- all 13 oil ministers are
expected to be there -- is that there will be some curbing of
the overproduction that brought oil prices to a near-collapse
earlier this month. The idea is to achieve output reductions
over May and June, at least, to get past the second quarter,
usually a weak period for oil demand.
   Yesterday, the perception that OPEC will be able to
achieve voluntary output reductions at least for those months
appeared to be spreading among oil-market participants. Also,
the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey reported that
leading Persian Gulf members may be prepared to agree to a 5%
production cut if it is for all of OPEC. That would be equal
to more than one million barrels a day.
   There were also some technical factors at work in the oil
markets yesterday. One trader noted that after the June West
Texas Intermediate contract hit the $19.10 level on the New
York Mercantile Exchange "there was very aggressive buying."
   Many traders later took profits. Still, the June WTI
contract settled 25 cents higher at $19.07 a barrel. July
crude was up 20 cents to $19.51.
   Further evidence of firming crude prices came in the
fields, where several refiners increased postings $1 a barrel
to $18 for West Texas Intermediate. Amoco Corp., which had
been posting $16 a barrel, increased the prices it will pay
for WTI by $2 to $18.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork belly futures prices settled
higher and the nearby contracts rose their limits in response
to a bullish inventory report issued by the Agriculture
Department on Friday that disclosed that fewer bellies were
stored than expected. According to the report, as of April 1
there were 97.5 million pounds of frozen pork bellies in
storage, while most analysts had expected 100 million pounds
on hand. "The bullish interpretation of the total frozen pork
bellies and higher hog prices at the terminal markets helped
to push hog prices higher," said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst
with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. Charles Levitt, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago, said the
overall action in the market was robust "as we continue to
feel the effects of strong demand for all meats during the
first quarter." Cattle futures prices closed mixed in the
wake of the bearish government report that showed that more
cattle was placed onto feedlots during March, which led
August and October contracts lower. "The report showed an
aggressive market pace during the first quarter, which helped
the nearby June contract, but also showed a larger placement
figure of young animals on feedlots in the first quarter than
anticipated," said Mr. Levitt.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell sharply, more than
erasing Friday's gains. The May contract declined 5.85 cents
a pound to $1.8965. The May contract on Friday rose 1.75
cents. The approach of the first day for the issuance of
notices on May 1 to deliver the concentrate against May
futures contracts may have contributed to the selling,
according to Judith Ganes, senior analyst for Merrill Lynch,
New York. Technical considerations also played a factor in
the substantial drop, as liquidation of May contracts
significantly increased when the price dropped below $1.90,
she said. However, Ms. Ganes added, the fundamentals of the
market didn't appear to justify the severe price decline. A
report late Thursday showed the amount of supply moving out
of Florida to the retail sector was more than one million
gallons a week, apparently indicating that consumer
resistance to higher prices wasn't as strong as had been
expected, Ms. Ganes said. Also, supplies may tighten in
coming months, she said. The Florida orange crop hasn't
recovered from the Christmas freeze and Brazil's harvest is
expected to be lower than last season's record output, Ms.
Ganes said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum futures prices rose sharply,
helping to pull up gold. July delivery platinum rose $7.70 an
ounce to $494.30. June gold was up $2.20 an ounce to $382.10.
May silver eased 0.80 cent an ounce to $5.10. Traders have
been preoccupied in recent weeks, said Nina Lipton, research
manager for the Platinum Group International, an industrial
group. Yesterday "they took a look at their charts and saw
that platinum has been oversold, particularly in the wake of
the sharp sell-off in gold in late March and they decided to
buy contracts," she said. Fundamentals also favor the buying
side, Ms. Lipton noted, particularly the strong demand for
the metal for environmental use, such as in automotive
catalytic converters. Another analyst noted that traders
still remain nervous over political tensions in South Africa,
which is the world's major supplier of platinum. Gold was
helped by the rise in platinum as well as a softening in the
securities markets, which could stimulate some demand for
gold as a safer haven, he said.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices were firm. The May contract rose
1.30 cents a pound to 75.31 cents. Today is the first day on
which notices to deliver cotton against the May contract will
be issued and traders bought back contracts they had
previously sold, causing prices to rise, said an analyst. He
noted that there is a tightness of supplies of better grades
of cotton in the U.S. Also, he said that Australia, a
significant supplier of good quality cotton to the world
market, has recently experienced heavy rains, which may have
hurt the quality of some of the cotton. Another analyst noted
that the rains in Australia came at a time when China is
perceived to have strong import needs and remains a potential
buyer of cotton. Expectations that U.S. economic growth will
continue to improve should keep domestic mills actively using
cotton, the analyst said. Industrial stocks have been down to
minimal levels for several months, causing mill demand for
cotton to continue strong, according to the analyst.

   Stocks Fall Further on Earnings;
   Pansophic Loses a Third of Value

   NEW YORK -- Stocks tumbled for the fourth straight session
as investors turned more bearish over rising interest rates
and weak earnings.
   Pansophic Systems became the latest in a series of recent
casualties of earnings-related selling, as its shares lost
around one-third of their value in extremely brisk trading
after a surprisingly weak earnings forecast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 29.28 points to
2666.67, the lowest closing level since March 5. In the past
four sessions, the average has posted consecutive losses for
a total decline of 99.11 points, or 3.6%. Yesterday's
sell-off was broad: 1,229 issues declined on the New York
Stock Exchange while only 328 advanced, the third time more
than 1,000 stocks have finished lower in the past four days.
Big Board volume of 136,150,000 shares was down sharply from
Friday's expiration-bloated volume of 174,260,000.
   Stocks fell quickly in morning trading on sell programs
that helped smack many key issues through what traders
considered important support levels. McDonnell Douglas fell 3
7/8 to 51 1/4, below a key support level of 54, said Jack
Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns Cos. Monsanto
broke support at 105, falling 2 7/8 to 102 7/8; Du Pont fell
through 36, slipping 7/8 to 35 3/4.
   CNA Financial broke 72, sliding 1 7/8 to 71 5/8.
   Mr. Solomon said the breakdown in individual stocks
reflects the weakness in key averages. "The weakness of the
Dow Jones Utility Average is of major importance," he said.
"It closed {yesterday} below the October {intraday} low of
207, and is at the lowest {closing} level since June 1989.
And this average is supposed to be a leading indicator." The
Dow Jones Utility Average fell 2.52 to 205.67; the
transportation average tumbled 13.51 to 1141.36.
   Citing the increase in market interest rates, First Boston
lowered its recommended asset allocation on stocks to 45%
from 55%, while increasing its bond weighting to 30% from
20%. The other 25% of the model portfolio remains in cash.
   The stock market "is very vulnerable to any rise in
interest rates from these levels," said Carmine Grigoli, the
firm's chief equity portfolio strategist. "Bonds are looking
more and more attractive relative to stocks."
   Yesterday, Treasury bonds fell nearly 1/4 point, or $2.50
for each $1,000 face amount, raising the yield to 8.96%.
   Other Wall Street strategists are changing their outlook
for stocks. Yesterday, Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst
for Kidder Peabody, urged the firm's clients to adopt a very
cautious posture on stocks. Mr. Jarrett said he expects
Treasury bond yields to rise above 9% and the Dow industrials
to fall to 2200 "by late summer." Mr. Jarrett advises staying
with stocks that have held up despite the market's sell-off,
such as Schlumberger, Motorola, International Business
Machines and Deere.
   Elaine Garzarelli, director of quantitative analysis at
Shearson Lehman Hutton, told clients Friday that at current
interest rates stocks are overvalued. She expects a
correction in the Dow to 2500 or 2600. However, Ms.
Garzarelli expects the correction to be followed by "a strong
rally." Among other things, she said the rate of
deterioration in corporate profits is slowing.
   Analysts estimate that aggregate earnings on the 500
companies in Standard &amp; Poor's index will be down 9% in the
first quarter vs. the same quarter a year ago, according to
Zacks Investment Research; however, the same analysts expect
earnings to rebound in the second half, from very depressed
year-earlier levels, and end the year 13% higher than in
1989.
   Pansophic plummeted 5 1/8 to 10 1/2 on NYSE -- composite
volume of 1.8 million shares -- nearly 54 times the average
daily volume in the software company's stock and more than
9.5% of its shares outstanding. The issue posted a loss of
32.8%.
   The company said it expects to report break-even results
for its fiscal year ending April 30, reflecting plans to take
charges for closing its Brazilian subsidiary and writing off
some assets of its graphics division. Analysts polled by
Zacks Investment Research had expected the company to post
net income of $1.15 to $1.30 a share for the fiscal year.
   Philadelphia Electric, which reported a first-quarter loss
of 40 cents a share, went down 3/4 to 15 3/4 on volume of 1.1
million shares. The utility also lowered its quarterly
dividend by 45%, to 30 cents a share, and said it would
institute a program to reduce costs by at least $100 million
annually by the end of 1991.
   Merrill Lynch, which fell 3/4 to 22 1/2, topped the NYSE's
list of most active issues as 2.9 million shares changed
hands. Other active issues were mostly lower as well; the
exceptions included Philip Morris, which rose 5/8 to 41 5/8
on 2.1 million shares, and Chase Manhattan, which closed
unchanged at 27 on 1.2 million shares.
   Exxon, whose first-quarter earnings were in line with
expectations, nevertheless dipped 5/8 to 45 3/4. Stocks hit
with selling in the wake of first-quarter reports included
Centel, which went down 3/4 to 30 1/4, and Far West
Financial, down 1/2 to 2.
   Handleman tumbled 3 5/8 to 14 3/8 after saying it expects
to post net income of eight cents to 15 cents a share for the
fiscal quarter ending Saturday, below both analysts'
forecasts and the year-earlier level.
   But Storage Technology gained 1 3/8 to 22 7/8 after
reporting better-than-expected earnings for the first
quarter. Although the company's net income dropped about 34%
from a year earlier, its income from operations surged nearly
51%.
   Armstrong World Industries, whose net from continuing
operations for the first quarter went up 68% from the
year-earlier level, rose 1 to 33 5/8. Communications
Satellite, whose net increased 15%, added 3/8 to 31 1/4.
   Bank of Boston gained 3/8 to 11 3/4. Responding to
analysts' speculation that its quarterly dividend could be in
jeopardy, the company told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report it would pay its dividend of 31 cents a share later
this month as scheduled. It added that it still expects to
report a first-quarter profit.
   Digital Equipment rose 1/4 to 83 1/4. Its board authorized
the repurchase of up to five million common shares, or about
4.1% of its shares outstanding.
   MGM/UA Communications rose 3/8 to 17 3/8 following news
that the required waiting period for Pathe Communications'
takeover offer of $20 a share had expired.
   King World Productions dropped 1 3/4 to 35 1/2. Confirming
market rumors, the company told the investor report it had
postponed the launch of a new game show based on the game
"Monopoly" from September until at least January 1991.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 3.01
to 344.95. The American Stock Exchange volume totaled
13,360,000 shares compared with 13,700,000 Friday.
   B.A.T Industries dropped 7/16 to 11 9/ 16. Hoylake
Investments, a group headed by British financier Sir James
Goldsmith, said it wouldn't renew its bid to acquire the
company.
   Sikes' Class A shares surged 3 7/8 to 16 1/8.
   Premark International agreed to acquire the company for
$201 million in cash; the accord calls for Class A
shareholders to receive $16.40 for each of their shares.
   Alza skidded 3 3/8 to 36 5/8. The company posted
first-quarter net income of 16 cents a share, up from 13
cents a year earlier but on the low end of analysts'
estimates.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Pacific West Cable Co. and an
affiliate filed a lawsuit in state superior court here
against Turner Broadcasting System Inc. in a dispute over
Turner's cable programming.
   At issue, according to Pacific West, is a new cable
technology that allows companies to beam cable programming
into homes without the use of cables. But Pacific West
alleges that Turner Broadcasting wants to do business only
with operators that use cable because wiring a neighborhood
for cable television limits availability and thus enhances
the value of Turner's programming.
</LP>

   In the suit, which seeks $25 million in punitive damages,
Pacific West said Turner maintains that use of the wireless
technology violates the programming agreement between Turner
and Pacific West, although Pacific West said there is no such
ban in its agreement. In Atlanta, Turner said it doesn't
comment on pending litigation.
   In its suit, Pacific West said it has attempted to resolve
its differences with Turner but said its overtures have been
rebuffed.

   WASHINGTON -- Peter Monroe, an official with the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, is expected to
be named to a top position in the savings and loan bailout
operation, industry and administration sources said.
   Mr. Monroe, a deputy assistant HUD secretary for housing,
would serve as the president and chief executive officer of
the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp., a role
that was initially the subject of some dispute. The Oversight
Board sets policy for the RTC, which sells or liquidates
insolvent thrifts and their assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Monroe would succeed William Taylor, a Federal Reserve
Board official who has served in the post on a temporary
basis since February. Mr. Taylor followed Daniel Kearney, a
former Salomon Brothers Inc. executive, who resigned in
February after just four months on the job. In resigning, Mr.
Kearney said unanticipated limitations had been placed on his
authority.
   Some in Congress have called for abolishing the Oversight
Board or streamlining the bailout operation in some way. The
board is perched at the top of the multilayered S&amp;L bailout
bureaucracy. It is made up of Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and HUD Secretary Jack
Kemp.
   Mr. Monroe would head the board's staff of several dozen
people. After the earlier confusion, it seems certain that
the responsibilities of the post will be clarified before it
is filled.
   The RTC, which has a board that's separate from the
Oversight Board, carries out the sales of the thrifts, using
mostly personnel from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Mr. Monroe didn't return telephone calls yesterday, and a
HUD spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Monroe has met with
several administration officials who have a role in making
the selection. The Oversight Board held a closed-door meeting
yesterday on the post.
   Mr. Taylor, who is director of the Fed's division of
banking supervision and regulation, wasn't a candidate for
the post. Under his direction, however, the Oversight Board
made headway on setting sales policies, including sweetening
some terms to attract more bidders.

   Cetus Corp., Emeryville, Calif., and F. Hoffmann-La Roche
Ltd. said they reached an agreement to market interleukin-2
products in Europe.
   The Roche Holding Inc. unit and EuroCetus B.V., Cetus's
European subsidiary, will each market both Proleukin and
Roferon-A in Switzerland and in all European Community member
countries except Denmark and Greece.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Each company will pay a commission to the other on sales
of its proprietary product. Proleukin is approved for
marketing in most of Europe for the treatment of advanced
kidney cancer. Roferon-A is approved for the treatment of
various cancer and viral diseases. The western European
anti-cancer market is estimated to be $700 million, the
companies said.
   The companies agreed to collaborate on the clinical
development of interleukin-2 products for other potential
cancer and non-cancer uses. Roche will make an initial
payment to Cetus and share in expenses for the development of
these additional therapeutic indications.
   In addition, the companies said they agreed to collaborate
on the development of Proleukin and Roferon-A as a combined
treatment for cancer and other diseases, with Roche bearing
the costs.

   Cie. Internationale des Wagons-Lits &amp; du Tourisme reported
a 46% plunge in group profit in 1989 in the absence of
extraordinary earnings and amid problems for its Europcar
car-hire venture.
   Group profit fell to 1.46 billion Belgian francs ($41.9
million) from 2.68 billion francs in 1988, the Belgium-based
travel and tourism group said. Group revenue gained 21% to
96.44 billion francs from 80.02 billion francs in 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Operating profit edged up 6.8% to 3.096 billion francs.
   Wagons-Lits said that the group's results in 1989 followed
an exceptional year in 1988, when the group had earned a
windfall profit on the sale of part of an office building in
Paris.
   But Wagons-Lits' 1989 results also were influenced by the
poor performance of the company's Europcar unit, which was
hit by the rise in interest rates and a slump in the
second-hand automobile market in Britain.

   NEW YORK -- U.S. traders followed the lead of Japanese and
European foreign exchange markets in bidding the dollar
higher yesterday on rising U.S. interest rates and new
worries about the effects of the monetary union of the
Germanys.
   The dollar briefly tested the 1.70-mark level three times
during the New York day before falling back on a lack of
follow-through buying.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But trading was termed thin, with participants hesitant to
push the dollar aggressively higher after seeing it
repeatedly fail to hold gains against the mark and yen in
recent sessions. The market used the scheduled release of
U.S. economic data today and Friday as an excuse to avoid
taking new positions, said Ty Tan, a dealer at Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank in New York.
   Long-term Treasury bond yields continued to inch toward
the psychologically important 9% level. Late in the New York
business day, the yield had risen to 8.96% from Friday's
8.94%.
   Durable goods orders for March, due for release today, are
seen up 1.7% from February, and the preliminary report on
first-quarter gross national product, estimated to show a
2.3% annual growth rate, is scheduled for release Friday.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6995 marks, up from 1.6875 marks late Friday, and at
157.60 yen, up from 157.45 yen late Friday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6356, down from $1.6388 Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 158.05 yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 157.55 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.7025 marks.
   On Monday, the U.S. unit's strength against the mark
derived from news that the West German government had
outlined plans to convert East German mark-denominated wages
and pensions at a one-toone rate with the West German mark,
participants said. Over the weekend, the conversion rate had
been brought into the spotlight again by a report in Der
Spiegel magazine forecasting a broader application of the
one-to-one rate than that proposed by the West German central
bank.
   The mark also was hurt by a 2.5% plunge in prices on the
Frankfurt stock market.
   That the dollar is testing 1.70 marks is of more
psychological importance than anything else, said Thomas
Palladino, a vice president at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank N.V.
in New York.
   The market has switched its focus from the dollar-yen rate
to dollar-mark dealings as monetary union creeps closer and
the troubles in Lithuania highlight the dollar's role as a
safe-haven currency, Mr. Palladino said.
   Concern about the inflation that might result in West
Germany from the conversion of so many East German marks to
West German marks at a one-to-one rate also prompted selling
of the mark against other currencies, particularly the yen,
participants said.
   After falling from 93.35 yen late Friday in New York to
92.99 yen at the close of Tokyo trading yesterday, the mark
slipped further to 92.89 yen at the London close yesterday,
finishing the global day in New York at 92.70 yen.
   With activity firmly fixed on the dollarmark rate,
dealings in the dollar-yen area remained static, traders
said.
   The U.S. currency is seen remaining stuck in a narrow band
against the yen, with no large moves likely until the level
of Japanese participation in the Treasury's refunding is
revealed next month.
   There is some fear in the market that Japanese investors
might scale back their participation in the refunding from
previous auctions. This anxiety stems from rumors that the
Japanese Ministry of Finance requested insurance companies to
restrain their purchases of dollar-denominated assets.
   Tokyo participants said yesterday they expect Japanese
participation at the U.S. auction to be lower than
previously, but not markedly so.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $378.90 an ounce, up $2.30. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $378.25 an ounce.

   Big Investors' Commission Rates May Have Hit a Low
   ----

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Commission rates paid by large investors on
stock trades, which have been falling for more than a decade,
may have finally hit a low point.
   While skeptics dismiss it as no more than wishful thinking
by brokers, indications that institutional commission rates
have firmed -- and may even increase -- have surfaced in a
new study by Greenwich Associates, Greenwich, Conn.,
consultants who do exhaustive research on the investment
industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Greenwich's latest survey of 600 institutional investors
found that the 115 largest, each of which pays $5 million or
more in annual commissions, expect their pershare costs to
rise this year. Though the expected climb is tiny -- to an
average of 6.6 cents a share from 6.5 cents in 1989 -- it
marks the first time since 1980 that Greenwich turned up
evidence that large institutional commissions are on the
rise. Greenwich has been conducting the study for 17 years.
   "One-tenth of a cent does not a trend make, but it is the
first time that it hasn't gone south" in a decade, Greenwich
consultant James A. Bennett Jr. said of the institutional
rate. But the aggregate forecast from all 600 institutional
investors surveyed showed that commissions are expected to
slip to 8.7 cents a share from 8.9 cents this year.
   Even if commission rates for big investors have hit bottom
at about 6.6 cents a share, they are still too low for
brokers to make a profit trading stocks for customers, said
Kevin L. Risen, brokerage analyst at Banc One Asset
Management Corp. "Eight to 10 cents a share is what I
consider to be a level they can make a profit at," he said.
   And stock trading executives see little inclination by any
of their customers to allow rates to move up quickly.
   Robert M. Dewey Jr., managing director, equity trading and
sales, at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said
that while institutions are talking about paying a bit more,
few are taking action. "You could put on one hand all the
people that have stepped up to the plate and said, `I want to
take my seven-cent commission up to eight cents,'" he said.
   With Wall Street's trading capacity still far larger than
necessary to handle the available business, many brokerage
executives remain doubtful that the slide in institutional
commission rates is over.
   "From what we have seen in the first quarter, there is no
indication that commissions are going up," said Stanley S.
Abel, chairman of Abel/Noser Corp., which specializes in
measuring stock trading costs. Brokers, he said, are "trying
to talk rates up," but customers still hold the upper hand.
   Ever since brokerage firms were forced to end their system
of fixed stock-commission rates in 1975, per-share trading
costs paid by big investors have declined steadily, squeezing
Wall Street's stock trading profits. And according to a big
securities firm, which declined to be identified, commission
rates kept tumbling in the first quarter of this year. An
executive at this firm said that from 1988 to 1989, average
commissions paid to the firm fell 4.79% to 6.56 cents a
share. For the first quarter of this year, commissions fell
another 2% to 6.42 cents a share, the lowest in this firm's
history.
   Some big investment firms are paying even less.
Independence Investment Associates, a money-management arm of
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., is typical of the big
investors that have significantly lowered their trading
costs. Independence's per-share commissions have fallen an
average of 10% annually in the past 15 years to 5.3 cents in
1989 from 25.6 cents in 1974.
   Still, some institutional investors said they are worried
that the drop in rates has gotten to the point that they are
paying hidden costs through the pricing and timing of their
stock trades.
   "We're starting to get a little concerned that we've
pushed these {commission} costs so low that maybe it is
affecting prices," said William F. Quinn, president of AMR
Investment Services Inc., which manages $6 billion for
employees of AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and other clients.
"We're hearing from a broad base of {money} managers that
liquidity isn't what it used to be," he said.
   As a result, Mr. Quinn said, he has authorized his outside
money managers to pay higher commissions if necessary, which
has resulted in AMR's per-share rate rising by perhaps half a
penny above its previous five-cents-a-share cost. "We've said
to managers that if they need to pay a little more
{commission} to get a trade done at the best price, they
should do it," he said.
   Joseph W. Perrone, chief investment officer of the $24
billion Texas Teacher Retirement System, also believes big
investors may have pushed Wall Street as hard as they can.
For the Texas teachers fund, with $9.5 billion in stocks,
saving a penny on the fund's average commission cost of six
to seven cents a share could easily get lost "in the noise
level," Mr. Perrone said. "While I'm sitting there
negotiating for one cent a share, I could lose $100,000 in
the market."
   "You've got to let those guys make some money or they
can't stay in business," he said. "We can just tell the
brokers not to write any commissions and they will just mark
up the stock."
   Mr. Dewey of Donaldson Lufkin said that despite customers'
haggling over ordinary business, large blocks that require
his firm to put up money to facilitate the trade are
commanding higher commissions. "When it comes to using our
capital to do a trade -- almost everybody is willing to pay
for that," he said.
   But some investors still believe the cost of trading is
too high in many cases. "I don't think it's low enough for
large traders," said Greta Marshall, former chief investment
officer of the $56 billion California Public Employees
Retirement System and now a money manager heading her own
firm.
   While she was at the California pension fund, Ms. Marshall
helped halve its average commission rate to five cents a
share, cutting off brokers who refused to adjust their fees.
But she noted that a nickel-a-share commission still amounts
to $500 on a 10,000-share trade. "It just doesn't cost that
much for a {trade} ticket," she said.
   Brokers, Ms. Marshall said, should boost charges to very
active traders, such as hedge funds, and cut them for those
who are usually in less of a hurry to get trades done, such
as pension funds.
   "The Street says, `We're not making any money,'" Ms.
Marshall said. "I say, `Maybe that's because you're
inefficient and you're not making people pay for things that
they use.'"

   Higher Crude Prices Boost
   Results for Production,
   Hurt Refining Margins

   Sharply higher crude oil prices boosted exploration and
production results at both Exxon Corp. and Amoco Corp., but
those same higher prices cut into chemical and refining
margins.
   Exxon operating profit in the first quarter rose slightly
although one-time items caused its net income to decline 29%.
Amoco profit rose 1.7%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Amoco said it paid an average of $20.79 a barrel for oil
in the quarter, more than $3 higher than a year ago. Because
crude oil is a raw material for so-called downstream
operations, chemical earnings were off sharply for both
companies, and gasoline refining and marketing profits were
weaker. Exxon and Amoco are the first major oil companies to
report first-quarter results, and other companies' earnings
are expected to follow the same pattern.
   Analysts say Exxon turned in a better first-quarter
performance than anticipated with its foreign exploration and
production business making a particularly strong showing.
Results "were better than what we were looking for," said
Frederick Leuffer, analyst for C.J. Lawrence Inc. Still,
Exxon lost 62.5 cents in composite trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange to close at $45.75 a share.
   Exxon reported net income of $1.28 billion, or $1.01 a
share, compared with $1.81 billion, or $1.41 a share, during
the same period last year. But the year-earlier quarterly
profit included a $535 million gain related to an accounting
change. Revenue grew by 20% to $26.7 billion.
   Profitability was marred somewhat by the U.S. refining and
marketing business, which reported a loss of $28 million down
from earnings of $37 million. Exxon explained some of this by
saying that results in the U.S. were unfavorably affected by
the partial loss of operating capacity at the Baton Rouge
refinery following a major explosion and fire last December.
   Missing in the quarter's results were any additional
charges related to cleaning up the spill caused when one of
Exxon's tankers rammed an underwater reef and dumped almost
11 million gallons into Prince William Sound last year. Last
year Exxon took $1.38 billion in charges stemming from
cleanup of its giant Alaskan oil spill.
   Exxon made no reference in its current earnings report to
the oil spill, which has made it the pariah of the industry.
But analysts say they don't expect the company to take any
additional charges related to cleanup efforts, which are to
resume in Alaska on May 1. "I think Exxon has probably
overreserved" for the upcoming cleanup effort, said Bryan
Jacoboski, analyst for PaineWebber Group Inc.
   In the first quarter, Exxon, New York, purchased 2.2
million shares of its own stock at a cost of $104 million.
Analysts noted that the buy-back rate has slowed to its
lowest level in more than seven years. They speculated that
some of the money typically used for stock repurchases was
shifted into capital spending, which grew by 5% excluding the
$3.9 billion acquisition of Texaco Canada. The growth in
spending, albeit small, indicates "a more aggressive,
healthier approach" for the company, Mr. Jacoboski said.
   Amoco said net rose to $466 million, or 91 cents a share,
from $458 million, or 89 cents a share. The 1989 first
quarter included a special charge of $57 million for
consolidation activities. Revenue rose 9% to $7.13 billion
from $6.52 billion.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Amoco fell 75
cents to $50.25 a share.
   Like Exxon, Amoco's exploration and production earnings
surged, to $295 million from $203 million. Despite higher
natural gas prices in the quarter, Amoco reduced its natural
gas production, as did many producers when the price fell
sharply after the unusually bitter cold ended by February.
   Chicago-based Amoco said its chemical earnings fell 49% to
$80 million. The company said margins were lower, as they
have been for a number of quarters. A combination of higher
prices for crude -- the feedstock for petrochemicals -- with
lower chemical prices is behind the profit decline.
   With gasoline refining and marketing profit of $111
million in the quarter, results were down just slightly from
$114 million.
   Separately, Ashland Oil Inc., Ashland, Ky., by and large a
gasoline refiner and marketer without its own crude oil
production, had a weak quarter. It had net of $913,000, or
two cents a share, compared with a loss of $13.8 million, or
25 cents a share, which included a $9 million charge. Sales
rose to $1.97 billion from $1.78 billion.
   Amerada Hess Corp., New York, said net fell to $39.7
million, or 49 cents a share, from $220.2 milllion, or $2.70
a share. Amerada Hess earnings fell so sharply in part
because of its accounting method, which analysts say cuts
into reported earnings when crude prices fall during a
quarter, as they did in the first period.

   Driven to losses by the Northeast's real estate slump,
Howard Savings Bank, announced a plan to return to
profitability by cutting staff, raising service fees and
reducing nonperforming loans.
   At the Newark, N.J., bank's annual meeting, Leo J. Rogers
Jr., president, confirmed his projection last month of a
$17.5 million loss for the first quarter. The loss resulted
from the addition of $29.5 million to the bank's allowance
for possible loan losses during the quarter. In the
year-earlier quarter, Howard Savings Bank earned $8.5
million, or 59 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Rogers said that about 10% of the current work force
of about 1,700 would be let go, with about 100 employees
offered early retirement at full pensions and other
reductions coming "through attrition." He said the bank's
first priority is to control and reduce nonperforming loans,
which will be supervised by the recently hired chief credit
officer, a new post.
   Mr. Rogers said Howard Savings will concentrate on
residential mortgages, home equity and other consumer loans
for the rest of the year.

   HOUSTON -- Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. reported a loss

ended March 31, reflecting a previously announced charge to
exit the hazardous-waste business.
   Earlier this month, the waste management concern disclosed

margins and regulatory problems in its hazardous-waste
business and plans to focus on solid waste, recycling and
medical-waste disposal.

   Revenue was $708.5 million. In the year-ago second

cents a share, on restated revenue of $582.3 million.
   Results for the year-ago period were restated to reflect
the discontinued hazardous-waste operation.
   In the six months, Browning-Ferris had a loss of $159.8
million, or $1.05 a share, compared with net of $118.4
million, or 79 cents a share. Revenue increased to $1.41

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Troubled Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association said its chief financial officer, David A. Sachs,
resigned effective May 11 to pursue "other business
opportunities."
   Neither Mr. Sachs nor the company could be reached for
comment yesterday evening. But in a statement, Columbia said
that Edward G. Harshfield, who was named president and chief
executive of the insolvent thrift last month, would serve as
acting chief financial officer until a successor to Mr. Sachs
could be found.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The thrift, once one of the nation's most profitable
because of its massive junk-bond holdings, was sent reeling
because of its junk-bond portfolio. Earlier this month, the
thrift said that declines of 50% or more in its junk-bond
holdings contributed to its insolvency.
   For the fourth quarter, Columbia had a loss of $379.1
million, or $19.17 a share. The worse-than-expected results
have left Columbia teetering on the edge of federal
receivership.

   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said John Antioco, one of its
top operations and marketing executives, is leaving the
company to become chief operating officer of Pearle Inc., a
chain of optical stores.
   Mr. Antioco, 40 years old, who has spent his career at the
convenience-stores concern, became one of four Southland
senior vice presidents in 1989. He was in charge of
Southland's 7-Eleven store operations, overseeing marketing,
operations and gasoline sales at the company's 7,000 outlets.
Prior to that, he was the company's vice president,
marketing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At Dallas-based Pearle, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC
of London, he will oversee the operations of 1,250 retail
eyewear stores operating under the names Pearle Vision
Centers and Pearle Vision Express.
   Both Southland and Pearle said Mr. Antioco's move isn't
related to Southland's trouble in paying its debt from its
1987 leveraged buy-out or Southland's recent agreement to
sell 75% of its equity to its Japanese partners.
   "We've been courting him for some time," said Howard
Stanworth, Pearle chairman and chief executive officer.

   The company said the earnings decline primarily reflects
lower results from semiconductor equipment operations, where
weakened demand and lower profit margins on key new products
combined to hurt profit. The company said it is attempting to

the efforts are too premature to discuss in detail.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock

   In the first half, net fell 28% to $15.4 million, or 79

   Groups of Disabled,
   Builders Oppose
   Apartments Plan

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- A group of disabled people has joined forces
with home builders to oppose proposed federal guidelines that
would make apartment buildings more accessible to the
handicapped.
   The National Coordinating Council on Spinal Cord Injury
and the National Association of Home Builders complained that
the guidelines, which were written by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and are still being reviewed by
the White House, are "impractical, inflexible and too
costly."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But there is division among the disabled. Bonnie Milstein,
co-head of the housing task force of the Consortium of
Citizens with Disabilities, said, "Most groups that represent
people who use {wheel}chairs support HUD's guidelines."
   Jack Powell, president of the spinal injury council and
executive director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, said
he opposes the guidelines because they would make housing too
expensive, thus denying accessibility through high cost.
   "Affordability is a central part of the accessibility
equation," Mr. Powell said in a statement released yesterday.
"Persons with disabilities -- like most other people -- have
limited budgets to meet their housing expenses. If HUD's
design guidelines result in significant increases in the cost
of housing, then we have really defeated the purpose of the
Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and created another
barrier to accessibility."
   The guidelines were prepared to carry out the 1988
legislation, which prohibited housing discrimination against
the disabled. New multifamily buildings with four or more
units and occupied after March 13, 1991, would be covered.
   Gordon Mansfield, HUD's assistant secretary for fair
housing and equal opportunity, said the opponents of the
guidelines base their opposition on "misunderstandings on
their part as to what we're doing."
   Mr. Powell estimated the HUD proposals would add $1,300 to
$3,700 to the cost of each walk-up unit and $3,200 to $4,250
to the cost of each mid-rise to high-rise unit. "During the
congressional debate in 1988, it was estimated by leaders in
the House and Senate that the costs for complying with this
legislation would run less than $500 per unit," Mr. Powell
said.
   Mr. Mansfield, a former official of the Paralyzed Veterans
of America, said the cost complaint is a "red herring." An
analysis of the HUD guidelines indicates they would add 1% to
the cost of housing, he said. "That is not an undue burden to
the building industry or people with disabilities," he added.
   The home builders and the spinal cord council have their
own set of guidelines that they say would be less expensive,
while in some cases providing greater accessibility than
HUD's. HUD's guidelines would require every bathroom in a
unit to be larger than currently required, but not
necessarily fully accessible to wheelchairs.
   The protesting groups say at least one bathroom should be
fully accessible, but each one doesn't have to be as large as
HUD wants. "The issue here is whether you need the extra
maneuvering space in the second bathroom or powder room,"
said Thomas D. Davies Jr., an architect for the Paralyzed
Veterans of America.

   Avon Products Inc. reported that first-quarter profit more

cost-cutting and lower interest expenses.
   The cosmetics concern's net income rose to $15.2 million,
or 11 cents a share, from $6.2 million a year earlier, which
resulted in a net loss of five cents a share after the
preferred dividend requirement.

   First-quarter sales fell slightly to $703.8 million from

sales fell 44% reflecting the sale of Parfums Stern, the

Parfums Stern, Avon's sales for the quarter rose 4% from a
year earlier.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Avon
shares closed yesterday at $35.375, down 50 cents.
   Avon said that its interest expense fell 13% in the first

first quarter was $695.9 million, compared with $1.13 billion

   Heard on the Street:
   GM Class E Stock Has Taken Some Lumps,
   But Dip Considered as Buying Opportunity

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- General Motors Class E shares, which give
investors a secondhand interest in GM's huge Electronic Data
Systems subsidiary, have been roughed up a bit in the past
week and a half.
   Just 12 days ago, the Class E shares hit a record high of
31 1/4. They since have dropped 8%, closing yesterday at 28
3/4, down 1/4. Besides general stock-market weakness, the
decline reflects new uncertainty about a big Texas Air
contract that investors had previously thought was in the
bag.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But money managers who like EDS's long-term prospects say
the dip may be a buying opportunity. They point out that EDS
is the largest company in the fast-growing business of
running other companies' computer operations.
   "There's a tremendous move on the part of corporations in
the past year and a half to outsource their MIS {management
information systems} departments," says James Craig,
portfolio manager of Janus Fund. "You turn over a nightmare
to somebody who does it for you. It's such a huge fixed
capital investment, and these guys can do it so well."
   The outsourcing ball really got rolling when Eastman Kodak
decided to do it, says Stephen T. McClellan, analyst with
Merrill Lynch. "There used to be a real stigma to farming out
your data processing," he says. "Since Eastman Kodak did it
last fall, there's no longer a stigma. It's a snowball
rolling downhill."
   Accordingly, Mr. McClellan rates EDS a strong buy, both
for the short term and long term. He expects EDS to earn
$2.07 a share this year, up from $1.81 last year. For 1991 he
predicts earnings of $2.37 a share.
   EDS is also popular with other Wall Street analysts. Of 13
who have a formal opinion, 11 rate it a buy, according to
Zacks Investment Research, Chicago. That's a mixed blessing
since stocks rated as buys by the largest number of analysts
tend to underperform the market, some research shows.
   EDS, however, looks as if it's going from strength to
strength. The percentage of its revenue derived from work for
General Motors should fall below 50% this year for the first
time since GM acquired EDS in 1984. EDS is the biggest factor
in the corporate data processing market, ahead of such
competitors as International Business Machines and the
consulting arm of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen.
   It has signed big long-term contracts -- ranging from $232
million to $600 million -- with such customers as Enron,
First City Bancorp. of Texas, Great Western Bank and
Freeport-McMoRan. The Texas Air contract, however, would
dwarf those. As envisioned in an EDS announcement in
February, EDS would run the computers for Texas Air's System
One reservation system. The contract would run 10 years and
bring in $4 billion.
   Investors are worried about whether the woes of Texas Air
subsidiary Eastern Airlines -- it's in bankruptcy-court
proceedings and a trustee has been appointed to run it --
will derail that fat contract or at least force a reduction
in its amount.
   Yesterday an EDS spokesman said that the negotiations with
Texas Air are still on track and that "nothing's really
changed in light of recent revelations about Eastern."
   Asked whether the $4 billion figure might have to be
modified, the spokesman declined to comment specifically.
"That gets into the realm of speculation," he said. The draft
contract "doesn't lend itself to easy breakouts."
   Eastern has "real problems. That's caused {EDS} stock to
get hit," says Mr. Craig of Janus Fund. "But that's just one
of multitudes of opportunities for them." Mr. Craig has
bought 730,000 shares of the stock since the beginning of
December.
   Two drawbacks of the Class E shares are that they aren't
cheap (selling for about 15 times the past 12 months'
earnings) and that they aren't a true common stock. General
Motors owns EDS. What Class E shareholders get is an
earmarked flow of dividends, based on a specified percentage
(currently 30%) of EDS's profits. The dividend yield is 2%.
   After 1994, General Motors has the right to exchange its
regular common shares for the special Class E shares. But to
do so, it must pay 20% above the average market price for the
previous 15 trading days.
   Still, several big money managers are betting that the
shares' virtues outweigh the drawbacks. Large money managers
added 1.3 million shares to their holdings in the fourth
quarter, according to CDA Investment Technologies. Among the
buyers were RCM Capital Management (which has a crackerjack
stock-picking record but won't comment on individual stocks
it buys), Sit Investment Associates and Waddell &amp; Reed.
   Eugene Sit, president of Sit Investment Associates, says
his holding now is over a million shares. He expects EDS
earnings to grow 15% a year, beating out most other companies
in a "slow-growth environment." As a result, he predicts the
shares will provide an investment return of 15% to 20% a
year, "not a home run, but a two-base hit."

   Digital Equipment Corp., continuing its stock buy-back
program, said its board authorized the purchase of as many as
five million, or 4.1%, of its common shares on the open
market.
   Digital's stock, which rose last week after it reported
mildly positive third-quarter results, closed yesterday at
$83.25, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
</LP>

   The Maynard, Mass., computer maker has purchased 18
million shares of its common for $2.1 billion over the past
several years. In announcing the latest buy-back
authorization, Digital asserted that the current market price
of its stock "does not reflect the underlying strengths of
the company."
   Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc., said
Digital's buy-back announcement didn't affect its stock much
partly because investors didn't interpret it as "a signal
that Digital's business is starting to get stronger." He
added that the indicated $415 million share repurchase "isn't
a very large buy-back, given that Digital has $2.2 billion of
cash."

   Armstrong World Industries Inc. reported first-quarter
earnings of $65.2 million, or $1.45 a share, a 74% increase
from year-ago net of $37.4 million, or 81 cents a share.
   The 1990 quarter's earnings include one-time gains
totaling $24.5 million, or 59 cents a share, from an
accounting change and the sale of woodlands. In the 1989
quarter, net included a gain of $2.7 million, or six cents a
share, from settlement of asbestos litigation, and profits of
$3.4 million, or eight cents a share, from discontinued
operations.

   The Lancaster, Pa., building products concern reported
sales of $640.4 million for the quarter. In the year-ago
quarter, Armstrong had sales from continuing operations of
$618.7 million.
   Armstrong attributed the strong performance to
better-than-expected profit margins in manufacturing. The
company said that sales and profit increased in four of its
major divisions, including the flagship flooring unit.
   Armstrong shares closed yesterday at $33.625, up $1, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   MANILA, the Philippines -- Powerless Mondays arrived in
Manila, causing thousands of companies to begin a series of
once-a-week closings.
   The daylong power cut, which didn't affect factories,
marked the most severe step yet to ease the country's serious
power shortage. Together with water shortages, traffic jams
and continuing concerns about political instability, the cut
added to the frayed nerves in the capital that have
accompanied the heat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's really ridiculous," said an American chemicals
manufacturer who spent much of Monday operating from his
apartment terrace dressed in shorts and a T-shirt. "Something
should have been done a long time ago."
   Foreign business executives have said for months that the
power crisis will further hinder the efforts by the
Philippines to attract new investment. Those efforts already
have been hurt by December's coup attempt and perceptions of
continued political instability.
   The program of Monday power cuts, which was announced last
month and affects all of Luzon island, is aimed at minimizing
the impact of the electricity shortage during the rest of the
week. Under the plan, offices agree to institute four-day
workweeks in return for government assurances that power cuts
on other days will be minimal. During the past month,
businesses, factories and residences have endured four to six
hours a day without electricity.
   Although factories aren't participating in the plan, the
government has asked them to voluntarily shut down or use
emergency generators for as long as 12 hours a day once a
week.
   The government has said the Monday cuts will continue at
least through May.

   DES MOINES, Iowa -- Meredith Corp. said net income rose
2.1% in the third quarter ended March 31 to $4.8 million, or
26 cents a share, from $4.7 million, or 25 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Excluding earnings from the Meredith/Burda commercial
printing operations, which the company has agreed to sell to
Donnelly &amp; Sons Co., profit fell 33% to $2 million, or 11
cents a share, from $2.9 million, or 16 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company cited lower profit margins in its
book-publishing business and soft revenue at its television
stations for the decline. Meredith said it expects the sale
of Meredith/Burda to be completed in the fourth quarter.
   Revenue rose 1.2% to $199.1 million from $196.7 million.
   Profits from Meredith's magazines, which include Ladies'
Home Journal, Better Homes and Gardens and other
publications, were "significantly higher" than a year ago,
the company said.
   Book-publishing operations, however, were hurt by
increased manufacturing costs and other expenses.
   For the first nine months, net fell 9% to $23.5 million,
or $1.27 a share, from $25.7 million, or $1.35 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 4% to $606.7 million from $583.1
million.

   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- In a move toward further

said it was authorized by federal regulators to take control
of Transcon Lines Inc.
   Both trucking companies are part of the $14 billion
"less-than-truckload" industry. Such companies carry several
small shipments in a single trailer. The industry has been
battered of late by pricing wars that have cut into profits.

   Transcon, formerly a unit of Transcon Inc. in Beverly
Hills, Calif, was sold earlier this month to closely held
Growth Finance Corp. in Miami. The price wasn't disclosed. In
1989, Transcon Lines had revenue of $226.5 million and
operating losses of $31.6 million.
   P-I-E said Transcon had requested that P-I-E take control
of all freight in its system and deliver it to customers.
Last Friday, the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington
cleared the transaction.
   Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
   P-I-E said the move wasn't a merger but rather an
"absorption" of one company's business into another. P-I-E
said that the transition has gone smoothly and that all
Transcon freight will be delivered this week.
   P-I-E is also closely held. Olympia Holding Corp., based
in Miami, acquired a majority interest in P-I-E earlier this
month. Terms weren't disclosed. In 1989, P-I-E had revenue of
about $500 million.
   Officials at Transcon couldn't be reached for comment.

$21.13 billion bid for B.A.T was the second-largest in

California's recent decision to bar a change in control of

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices slipped for the seventh
consecutive trading session, as investors continued to sell
bonds on fears that this week's slate of economic indicators
will provide more negative news for bonds.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which lost 3 1/2
points last week, or $35 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount, ended only 1/4 point lower yesterday. Yields on the
benchmark bond rose to about 8.96%, highest in nearly a year.
Last week's rout was triggered by a sharp rise in inflation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Sentiment is horrible," said Michael Moore, a trading
manager at Continental Bank. He said several economic
indicators are due out this week, but that investors are most
anxious about three of them: First-quarter employment cost
index and durable goods orders, both due today, and Friday's
advance estimate of first-quarter gross national product.
   The consensus view of economists is for an annual
inflation-adjusted growth rate of 2.5% for GNP, twice as high
as earlier estimates. Orders for durable goods in March are
expected to have rebounded sharply, while employment costs
are expected to have increased 5.2% in the first quarter.
   Although such reports are considered positive for the
economy and certain workers, they disturb bondholders because
rising inflation and faster economic growth sometimes leads
to higher interest rates. Inflation and higher interest
rates, in turn, reduce the value of bonds.
   Moreover, investors are concerned about the market's
ability to absorb about $30 billion of bonds that the
Treasury department plans to sell early next month in its
quarterly refunding of the federal debt.
   With so many potential land mines, traders said many
investors are staying away from the market.
   However, Mr. Moore said he noticed a modest pickup in
"some selected buying" activity which may have kept the
market's losses relatively small.
   "The pace at which the market is declining has started to
slow," said Mr. Moore. "It was the first day in some time
that we've seen some buying by institutional investors," he
said.
   Another reason prices didn't fall more sharply yesterday,
according to several traders, was that there were no rumors
of large-scale selling by Japanese investors.
   Bonds were unchanged to slightly lower in light activity
in early trading. But prices suddenly turned moderately lower
in midafternoon on news that a few investment firms placed
large "put" orders for bond futures. A "put" option is a
futures contract that allows the buyer to sell Treasury bonds
in the future for a price that is set at the time the
contract is placed. Essentially, the put buyer is betting
that prices will fall.
   When trading is brisk, a few large put orders could go
unnoticed in the market. But, when trading is quiet, such as
it was yesterday, a few large put sales can force bond
holders to sell.
   "When the market is not very solid, it can be easily
pushed by one or a few large-scale put orders," said John
Slosberg, a senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data
Global Markets Group.
   Despite the concerns about next month's quarterly
refunding, tomorrow's sale of $10.5 billion of new two-year
notes is expected to go smoothly.
   Investors who unloaded bonds during last week's selling
frenzy might want to park their cash in relatively short
securities that are less affected by inflation worries, and
the new two-year notes should benefit as a result, some
analysts said.
   "There may be some yield-curve arbitrage interest in
buying two-year notes and selling longer-dated maturities,"
said Richard Kelly of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
   In when-issued activity, the new two-year notes were
yielding 8.84%, up slightly from late Friday in New York.
   Separately, the Public Securities Association, a trade
group, said an "advisory panel" formed in February has
developed recommendations for "speeding the development of
any proposed industry joint ventures" to disseminate U.S.
Treasury securities price information.
   The panel, headed by William Brachfeld of Daiwa Securities
America Inc., will disclose its recommendations to the PSA's
Primary Dealers Committee at the association's spring meeting
later this week. A report is expected to be issued by PSA
"within a few weeks."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted at about 95 4/32 to
yield 8.96% compared with 95 11/32 to yield 8.935% on Friday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of about 96 25/32
to yield 8.98% compared with 97 to yield 8.94% on Friday.
   Treasury bill rates moved higher when compared with last
week at the government's weekly bill auction.
   The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury
bills was 7.78% and the average rate on six-month bills was
7.91%. That was up from last week's auction, when they were
7.71% and 7.75%, respectively.
   The Federal Farm Credit Banks issued $250 million offering
of four-year notes. The notes were priced at par to yield
9.25% through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets. The notes, which are noncallable for two years, will
be reoffered at various prices.
   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   News that Philadelphia Electric Co. slashed its annual
common stock dividend nearly in half to $1.20 a share sparked
buying interest in the company's bonds.
   While Philadelphia Electric common stock fell 3/4 point to
15 3/4, the bonds rose between 1/2 and 3/4 point. Traders at
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. said
Philadelphia Electric's bellwether 9.25% notes due 1999 ended
at 95 3/4, up 3/4 point.
   Dan Scotto, a DLJ analyst, said the price rise "was purely
based on the amount of cash that will be retained by the
company," as a result of the dividend cut. Mr. Scotto, who
issued a credit-rating upgrade on the company yesterday
morning, estimates that the utility's internally generated
cash should rise by more than $250 million.
   Most other investment-grade corporate bonds ended
unchanged.
   In the junk bond market, prices ended unchanged to about
1/4 point lower in extremely light trading.
   Among the notable exceptions to the market's downward bias
were junk bonds of Supermarkets General Holdings Inc. which
continued to firm after last week's news that the company's
loss narrowed significantly in the first quarter.
   Supermarkets General's 14 1/2% senior subordinated notes,
due in 1997, were quoted 1/2 point higher at 90. The bonds
had surged three points Friday.
   Junk bond traders said news that junk bond financier
Michael Milken will agree to plead guilty to six felony
counts and pay $600 million in fines and restitution didn't
have an effect on the market.
   Although Mr. Milken is largely credited with creating the
junk bond market under the aegis of now defunct Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., he has played an almost negligible role
in the market during the past two years.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities traded in a two-tiered market, as
discount issues fared poorly while premium issues rose.
   Traders said there was talk of a seller of discount
securities as well as buyers of premium issues.
   The poor performance of discount Government National
Mortgage Association issues reflected the bearish market
environment. These issues have long average lives, low
current yields and relatively tight spreads above Treasury
issues.
   Ginnie Mae 9% securities for May delivery ended at 93
29/32, down 10/32; its 9 1/2% securities at 94 15/32, down
9/32; and its 10% securities at 99 1/32, down 8/32. In
contrast, Ginnie Mae's 11% issue was unchanged at 103 10/32;
its 12 1/2% issue was up 1/4 at 109 4/32; and the 13% issue
gained 10/32 to 110 1/2.
   Securities issued by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and
Federal National Mortgage Association fared better than
Ginnie Maes because they were in demand from underwriters of
derivative securities and because they have shorter average
lives than the Ginnie Maes.

   Municipal bonds were mostly unchanged to 1/4 point lower
in listless trading, with some bonds down 1/2 point.
   Uncertainty over whether Treasury issues are in for
further declines pushed municipals lower for the fifth
straight session, while keeping most participants on the
sidelines, traders said.
   In the new-issue arena, a Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. group priced
a $60 million issue of Missouri Environmental Improvement and
Energy Resources Authority revenue bonds, Union Electric Co.
project, to yield 7.57% in 2020.
   Among dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20%
bonds due in 2018 were off 1/4 point at 96 3/8 to yield
7.48%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Major European bond markets slumped in reaction to
Friday's downturn in the U.S. bond market.
   Traders said West German, British and French government
bonds fell at the start of trading yesterday, which was the
first chance that European traders have had to react to the
sharp one-point decline in U.S. bond prices that occurred on
Friday.
   Traders said British bond prices were also bid lower due
to talk of expected turmoil in the labor markets this summer
as transportation and electricity workers push for high wage
settlements. Some analysts are forecasting an inflation rate
of 10%, up from the current rate of about 8.1%.
   At the end of trading yesterday, French bonds had
recovered the bulk of their losses, but Britain's benchmark
long-term bond closed 1/4 point lower while West Germany's
benchmark 10-year bond finished about 1/2 point lower.
   In Japan, uncertainty about today's expected auction of
new 10-year Japanese government bonds kept the market trading
in a narrow range with bond prices ended slightly weaker. The
yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year bond was 7.32% and the
price was down 0.11 at 86.22.

   Goldsmith Ends Attempt to Buy B.A.T
   Amid Public Worries on Leveraged Bids

   LONDON -- Sir James Goldsmith threw in the towel in his
quest for B.A.T Industries PLC, in what would have been the
second-largest takeover in history.
   Sir James's Hoylake Investments Ltd. said it wouldn't
renew its bid for the London-based tobacco, financial
services, retailing and paper company. Hoylake's original #13
billion ($21.31 billion) bid, launched last July, lapsed last
September under British takeover law. Hoylake gave no reason
for its decision.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But it is clear that the Anglo-French Sir James, one of
the most flamboyant corporate raiders of the past decade,
again has fallen victim to a shift in official and public
attitudes toward hostile bids, particularly highly leveraged
proposals. And, as part of the change, individual U.S. states
are increasingly flexing their muscles as anti-takeover
champions.
   Many in the international investment community said the
fatal blow against Hoylake was struck in California on April
10 when the state insurance commissioner barred a change in
control of B.A.T's Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit. Hoylake
would have sold Farmers to a French insurance concern,
Axa-Midi Assurances, for $4.5 billion if it had won control
of B.A.T. But California insurance commissioner Roxani
Gillespie said that the leverage of the deal would have
endangered Farmers.
   Taking stock of the changing mood toward hostile
takeovers, Ron Freeman, head of international investment
banking at Salomon Brothers Inc., said: "In the 1980s, all
mergers and acquisitions were good. Now, in some people's
minds, no M&amp;A is good. Neither position is correct."
   Mr. Freeman, whose firm wasn't involved in the bitter
10-month Hoylake-B.A.T fight, added: "The federal court
system in the U.S. went too far in one direction, when it
said that the only relevant constituency was the
shareholders. But now states are becoming much more dominant,
and are moving in the other direction," toward protecting
corporate boards and employees.
   Moreover, for foreign companies, a hurdle encountered more
often is the flag-waving sometimes associated with such a
takeover attempt. For example, in the $1.64 billion hostile
bid by London-based BTR PLC for Worcester, Mass.-based Norton
Co., the Union Jack was burned on the steps of Worcester's
city hall last month by Norton workers fearing they would
lose their jobs if the takeover goes through.
   Ironically, it was to escape this wave that Sir James
cashed in his U.S. chips in 1987 and moved back across the
Atlantic to concentrate on European targets. He had been
doused by the first groundswell in 1986 when he abandoned a
bid for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. after workers of the
Akron, Ohio, company demonstrated on the U.S. Capitol steps
against foreign takeovers.
   But the Atlantic has proven no shield for Sir James.
Axa-Midi said it would withdraw its change-of-control
applications in all nine states where Farmers operates. "We
are naturally disappointed," said Claude Bebear, Axa
chairman, who added that the French company remains
"steadfastly committed to gaining a position in the U.S.
insurance market."
   Sir James couldn't be reached for comment.
   However, in a conversation last September, he said that
his strategy had gone awry early. The strategy was to launch
an all-paper bid, thereby initially avoiding finance fees;
get regulatory clearance in the U.S.; and then inject cash
into the bid.
   But he said he was surprised at the resistance of state
insurance regulators. Sir James believed that the insurance
commissioners would be glad to see Farmers divested from a
tobacco company, and thought that B.A.T would be persona non
grata because of the long fight it had with regulators when
it took over Farmers in 1988.
   Sir James conceded that a loss would damage his prestige.
"If I lose," he said, "obviously it's because I made a
mistake. If you get caught between two cars, it's your
fault."
   At 850 pence a share, the Hoylake bid would have made a
B.A.T takeover second in size only to the $25 billion
acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co. in 1988. Made last July 11 when B.A.T shares were at 694
pence, the bid caused the stock to soar as high as 936 pence
last year.
   But lately the stock has been receding as Hoylake's hopes
grew dimmer. B.A.T shares closed in London yesterday at 724
pence, down 4 pence. The Hoylake announcement was made after
the market closed.
   With 1% of B.A.T, Hoylake has made enough to more than
offset about #30 million in legal and other costs. But its
paper profit apparently won't approach the $93 million Sir
James made when he sold his Goodyear shares back to the
company in 1986.
   The Hoylake bid galvanized B.A.T into making major changes
that the company said it was planning anyway. Reducing itself
to a tobacco/financial-services company, B.A.T among other
things last Friday sold Marshall Field's, the major Chicago
retailer, to Dayton Hudson Corp. for $1.04 billion, and soon
will sell its Saks Fifth Avenue retail chain.
   In typical Sir James style, Hoylake's brief statement
concluded: "The directors of Hoylake wish B.A.T and its
unbundled offspring great success within their new
structures."
   But the changes, a B.A.T spokesman claimed, were "the
turning point" in the company's battle against Hoylake.
   "I am pleased that Hoylake and Axa-Midi have finally
abandoned their bid," Patrick Sheehy, B.A.T chairman, said
yesterday. "We can now devote our full attention to running
the continuing group based on our financial-services and
tobacco businesses."

   BONN PROPOSED a generous plan for monetary union with East
Germany.
   In a bid to calm East German fears, the West German
government unveiled the outlines of a plan for merging the
two nations' currencies. Under the proposal, individual East
German wages and savings of as much as $2,373 would be
changed into West German marks at a favorable one-to-one
rate. The offer is considered a major concession to East
Berlin, which argued that workers need to be cushioned during
a transition to a market economy.

   While reiterating its refusal to make any deals, the White
House said it was continuing "to probe all sources of

his call for their "unconditional" release. In West Germany,
Polhill, who was freed Sunday by pro-Iranian extremists,
underwent a physical examinaton and doctors said he was
malnourished and mildly dehydrated. The 55-year-old New
Yorker had been held for more than three years.
   The foreign minister of Iran, which joined Syria in

   NEPAL'S POLICE BATTLED mobs, threatening a transition to

   In the first major violence since the Himalayan kingdom
lifted a ban on political parties two weeks ago, police
opened fire on demonstrators after crowds rampaged in
Katmandu. At least 11 people were reported killed, including
six police officers beaten to death by protesters. The mobs
accused security forces of condoning a monarchist group
blamed for a wave of crime aimed at undermining Nepal's
four-day-old government. A curfew was imposed on the capital.
   Prime Minister K.P. Bhattarai, who has said Nepal may be
headed for a constitutional monarchy, met with King Birendra
to review the situation.

   Lithuania closed the Baltic republic's only oil refinery
because of the Kremlin's cutoff of energy supplies. The prime

use of Soviet troops in Lithuania.
                                                                                                       

   Bush plans to meet today with congressional leaders to

   A Shift to Services
   Means Shrinking Staff

   BUSINESS establishments in the U.S. are shrinking.
   A new study by the Small Business Administration shows
that the average number of employees per place of business
decreased 7% between 1977 and 1986, when the most recent
figures were provided.
   The SBA attributes the decrease to the shift from a
goods-producing economy to a service economy.
   While manufacturing experienced a 7.6% decline in
employees per business establishment during the period,
services posted a 12% increase and retailing had a 15% rise.
   "In manufacturing, we've seen a lot of downsizing, and new
plants are smaller in terms of number of employees. By
contrast, in retail there's been a lot of merger activity,
and that may be the reason for the average increase in size
there," explains Bruce D. Phillips, who is in charge of data
analysis for the SBA's Office of Advocacy.
   Geographically, the Mountain states, from Montana to
Arizona, had the biggest drop in number of employees per
establishment -- 19%. The Midwestern states had a 17%
decrease and Southern states showed a 10% to 12% decrease.
The West Coast, however, posted a sharp gain in employees per
firm, rising 40% over the decade-long period. The only other
region to show an increase was the Mid-Atlantic, up 1.6%.
   The study doesn't distinguish individual businesses from
units of larger companies.
                                                                                                       

   Fighting Foreign Rivals
   Without Losing Money
                                                                                                       

   MORE SMALL companies are finding they can file their own
complaints -- without a lawyer -- against foreign competitors
violating trade laws.
   The U.S. International Trade Commission's Trade Remedy
Assistance Office, established as a separate unit a year ago,
focuses mainly on helping small companies file petitions to
the commission to halt unfair trade practices, such as
"dumping" goods at illegally low prices or infringing on
intellectual property rights.
   The office says 10 small companies pursued complaints in
the past year, compared with "two or three" the previous year
when the office's functions were handled part time as part of
another bureau's work. Successful petitions commonly result
in orders imposing a high duty on the foreign product or
barring it entirely.
   "I pursued our case because I found I could do it without
a lawyer," says Nicholas Polydoris, chairman of ENM Co.,
Chicago, a maker of digital counters. With the Trade Remedy
Assistance Office's help, the company last month filed an
anti-dumping petition against a Brazilian competitor.
"Without this program, we would have gradually phased out the
product and emphasized other products," he says. "I found
lawyers dealing with the ITC might expect $250,000, and we
couldn't risk that kind of money." Instead, young staff
members Thomas Howland and Anup Manchanda prepared the
petition with guidance from Washington.
   The process is cheap -- but exhaustive. Geofrey Wyatt,
executive vice president of Wyatt Technology Corp., a Santa
Barbara, Calif., maker of analytical instruments, says
preparing a recently filed 150-page anti-dumping petition
against a Japanese concern took half his time for four
months. "But if we had hired a Washington law firm, the whole
process would cost $100,000 to $1 million," he says. "Just
getting to the stage we're at would have been $50,000 to
$100,000. I thought it would be a lot harder than it turned
out to be -- and we have spent nothing," he adds.
                                                                                                       

   Incubators Could Use
   Some Help Themselves
                                                                                                       

   AS FAST AS they've spread, business incubators need
improving, a recent survey suggests.
   These business parks are designed to nurture fledgling
companies with low rent and shared office services, as well
as management, financial and legal advice. Their numbers have
grown from 50 in 1984 to 400 today.
   But nearly 40% of incubator tenants surveyed by Coopers &amp;
Lybrand's National Emerging Business Services group say
incubator managers should be better trained, devote more time
to their tenants and increase their tenants' exposure to
accountants, lawyers and consultants. Only 30% of the 133
respondents said the incubator played a major role in helping
them obtain financing.
   Despite such criticisms, incubators are making a
considerable contribution to their tenants, mainly by
reducing operating costs, the survey shows. While
three-quarters of the respondents had annual sales of less
than $100,000 upon entering an incubator -- including 40%
started from scratch there -- only 18% have sales under that
level today. (Many of the respondents have since graduated
from incubators.) Nearly a quarter now have more than $1
million in sales.
   The study also shows an increase in employment at
incubator companies. Of the survey respondents, only 1% had
10 or more workers when they entered the incubator. Today,
34% have attained this level.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   ONE OUT OF EVERY eight small businesses in the country is
in California, says a new study by Wells Fargo Bank, San
Francisco. These businesses, defined as having fewer than 50
employees, accounted for one out of every three jobs created
in the state in the past decade, the bank adds. . . . More
small businesses are turning to partial self-insurance as a
way to hold down skyrocketing costs of their health-coverage
premiums, according to the March issue of "BrainTrust," a
joint publication of Laventhol &amp; Horwath and Mark Stevens
Features.

   NEW YORK -- City police arrested 204 demonstrators, mostly
for disorderly conduct, as environmental activists attempted
to stop the New York Stock Exchange from opening yesterday.
   Several hundred demonstrators, protesting what they said
is U.S. corporations' abuse of the environment, were met by
several hundred police officers who ringed the exchange
building at the corner of Broad and Wall streets.

   Exchange operations weren't disrupted. "The whole system
worked as it would on any other day," said a spokesman for
the Big Board.
   The exchange has increased security in recent months. In
September, a group of activists for victims of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome wore fake identification badges,
entered the trading floor and disrupted trading. That
demonstration was the most successful since August 1967, when
Abbie Hoffman and a dozen others threw dollar bills from the
visitors' gallery to the trading floor, causing havoc.
   A spokesman for the police department said two
demonstrators were arrested and charged with assaulting
police officers. One other protester was charged with
possessing Chemical Mace. Five officers and four
demonstrators suffered minor injuries.
   The demonstration began at about 6 a.m. EDT and lasted a
few hours. Demonstrators attempted to block the path of
exchange employees heading to work. But police closed off a
section of Wall Street to all traffic and pedestrians except
those who work on the block.
   One demonstrator carried a giant makeshift hypodermic
needle marked "Fossil Fuel Junkies." Another was dressed in a
white zippered suit on which had been written the names of
various chemicals and elements such as toluene, CFC, or
chlorofluorocarbons, and mercury.
   And a man who would identify himself only as a student at
State University of New York, Stony Brook, was trying to give
away dollar bills to financial types heading to work. He said
corporations were ignoring environmental needs for the sake
of profits. "I know that deep in the heart of every worker on
Wall Street is a profound lust for money," he said.

   CalFed Inc. said improved core earnings pushed
first-quarter profit up 8% to $18.9 million, or 75 cents a
share, from $17.5 million, or 70 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   CalFed, whose principal unit is California Federal Bank,
attributed the improvement in the quarter to a 28% spurt in
net interest income in its financial services segment to
$128.5 million from $100.7 million.
</LP>

   The Los Angeles company also said that the quarter
benefited modestly from a $1.3 million after-tax gain on the
sale of Anglo-American Insurance Co., CalFed's London-based
property-casualty insurance subsidiary. The Feb. 6 sale
marked the company's exit from the property-casualty
business.
   During the quarter, CalFed said its net interest margin --
the spread between the yields on loans and the cost of funds
-- improved to 2.24% from 1.47% a year ago.
   CalFed's California Federal unit, with $25.3 billion in
assets, currently exceeds all three capital requirements
under the thrift-rescue bill, CalFed said.

   Tokyo stocks finished lower in lackluster trading Monday
as the Nikkei index fluctuated in a fairly narrow range,
pushed lower in the afternoon by some profit-taking on
domestic-demand-related issues, traders said.
   London stocks were notably lower and at Frankfurt share
prices plunged 2.5% in moderate but nervous trading in the
market's steepest one-day drop since a 2.9% decline January.
The Frankfurt market declined on worries about growing
militancy on the part of the country's largest union, IG
Metall, and concerns about a new proposal by the West German
government to convert more East German marks into Deutsche
marks at a one-to-one exchange rate. Traders also cited a
fall in bond market prices and prospects for higher interest
rates in West Germany and abroad as contributing factors to
the market's steep descent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most other major world markets also finished with losses.
   At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues
retreated 156.37 points to close at 29679.07. The index lost
109.97 points Friday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index was down 333.66 points
to 29345.41 at the end of the morning session.
   Monday's volume on the First Section was estimated at only
330 million shares, down sharply from 687 million Friday.
   Losing issues outnumbered winners, 583 to 357, while 169
remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which rose 0.67 point Friday, lost
12.96 points, or 0.59%, to 2201.20.
   The Second Section index, which added 10.77 points Friday,
lost 12.35 points, or 0.35%, to close at 3549.85.
   Volume in the Second Section was estimated at 15 million
shares, up from 10 million Friday.
   Observers said there's strong resistance for the Tokyo
Stock Price Index at around 2250 points, at which level heavy
broad-based selling can be expected.
   But "the resistance in the short term is less severe on
the Nikkei," whose near-term ceiling is seen at 30000 points,
because arbitrage activity is likely to bid blue-chip issues
higher and keep the index afloat, one trader at a foreign
securities firm said.
   Traders said that there was little incentive to buy or to
sell Monday, despite the relative stability of macroeconomic
factors such as the yen and bond prices. The market's
lackluster and somewhat wary sentiment was reflected in the
day's scant activity.
   "I was expecting more volume today," said Yusuke Fujiwara,
head of trading at Baring Securities Ltd. Although the
dollar-yen rate "wasn't moving much, I guess people are kind
of cautious," he said.
   But some investors were taking the opportunity to take
profits whenever there were small price gains in selected
sectors, traders said. Because the market will be closed
Monday, Thursday and Friday next week for Golden Week,
investors are likely to want to close long positions ahead of
this weekend, they said.
   Moreover, "futures slid down consistently most of the day,
indicating that the market is probably in a profit-taking
mode for the time being" rather than being manipulated by
index-related trading, said one trader at Nomura Securities
Co.
   Activity should remain limited to such small-lot
profit-taking in the short term, traders said.
   "No one's going to do any real aggressive buying" ahead of
Golden Week, the trader at Nomura added.
   Large, domestic-demand-related stocks, such as steel,
electric power and trading companies, were softer on
profit-taking Monday.
   Traders said that the "Big Four" Japanese securities firms
were supporting high-tech electricals from falling too low
Monday. Hitachi slipped 20 yen (13 cents) to 1,560 yen
($9.91), Kyocera lost 50 to 7,220, Pioneer was down 80 to
5,970, Sony fell 30 to 8,230 and TDK fell 90 to 6,810.
   Kawasaki Steel slipped 2 to 600, Kobe Steel fell 8 to 593,
Nippon Steel retrenched 8 to 590 and Daido Steel fell 18 to
799.
   Tokyo Electric Power lost 80 to 4,110, while Kansai
Electric fell 50 to 3,380.
   Chubu Electric was down 30 to 3,180.
   London share prices were lower, led down on bearish
sentiment, a weak start on Wall Street and a handful of
special situations.
   Stocks were depressed from the outset in the wake of a
savage attack on the banking sector in local press reports,
dealers said.
   Additionally, late-morning money supply figures added to
the market's misfortunes; the figures showed a #9.2 billion
($15.09 billion) rise in bank lending for the latest month,
much higher than the #7.5 billion expected.
   These new money supply data for March showed that while
domestic demand remains relatively buoyant, the country's
corporate sector is coming under increasing pressure from the
high level of base rates. The figures "took the market from
being just slightly down to being really down," said one
director of equities.
   And although weak from the start, London shares descended
more energetically on a disappointing start to Wall Street,
where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 33.34 points
at the close of the European day.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was down 27.9 points at 2159.2, just above the intraday
minimum of 2159.1 and well below the opening best of 2185.1.
   At its final tally, the narrower FT 30 share index was
down 19.9 points at 1692.7. Volume amounted to a sparse 382.6
million shares, down from 410.7 million Friday.
   Traders also suggested that activity remained thin as the
market awaited Wednesday's release of U.K. balance of
payments data for March.
   In corporate developments, Hammerson shares were down on
news of its results showing a 0.3% increase in pretax profit.
The shares shed 23 pence (38 cents) to 720 pence ($11.80).
   Clearing banks were among the hardest hit, as some
suggested that the money supply data combined with poor
results from banks in the U.S. and negative local press
comment to knock banks' share prices.
   Barclays dropped 18 pence to 519 in heavy dealing of six
million shares. National Westminster shed 16 to 311, Midland
Bank was off 6 to 310 and Lloyds lost 9 to 255. Dealers said
program trades contributed to the weakness in the sector's
prices.
   Eurotunnel, which reported a long-expected increase in
cost estimates for the channel tunnel project that will force
a rights issue and additional bank lending, saw its shares
drop as much as 10 pence before finishing 5 higher at 578.
   Elsewhere, stock prices closed lower in Paris, Brussels,
Amsterdam and Milan and mixed in Stockholm. Zurich was closed
for a local holiday. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Share prices closed lower in Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney,
Singapore and Manila, were mixed in Wellington and higher in
Taipei.

   Ingersoll Extends
   Offer to Buy Back
   Affiliate's Bonds

   NEW YORK -- Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. has extended its
cash tender offer to holders of an affiliate's junk bonds,
but it probably will have to sweeten the offer because it
hasn't attracted a single bondholder.
   The financially strapped newspaper holding company, which
is controlled by Ralph Ingersoll, made an offer last month to
buy back about $240 million of junk bonds at a deep discount
to their face value. The newspaper company is struggling to
avoid default on its heavy debt load at a time of slumping
newspaper advertising sales. Community Newspapers Inc., the
issuer of the bonds, publishes daily and weekly newspapers in
Ohio and New York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But bondholders who objected both to the price and the
structure of the deal organized an unusual, total boycott of
the offer. Since no bondholder accepted the offer for 13%
"reset" bonds and discount debentures by midnight EDT last
Friday, Ingersoll said it will extend the offer until
midnight May 4.
   James Rubin of Sass Lamle Rubin &amp; Co., which is a holder
of the bonds and helped organize the group of disgruntled
bondholders, said the holders won't tender their bonds until
the offer is improved, but he expects that to happen. "They
have solicited our assistance in formulating a more
acceptable recapitalization," Mr. Rubin said. "We're
optimistic that a successful solution can be achieved.
   Ingersoll executives couldn't be reached for comment, but
the company is under serious time pressure to resolve the
matter. That's because of a provision covering about $125
million of the bonds, whose interest payments must be reset
by July 7 to make up for a drop in the bonds' price, an event
Ingersoll can't afford to let happen considering its
financially weakened state.
   Mr. Rubin said the bondholders' biggest objection is to
the structure of the offer. Only a portion of the holders'
bonds are to be tendered and the outstanding ones "are going
to have severely reduced protective covenants that could
render them worthless or near-worthless in certain
scenarios," said Mr. Rubin.
   Then there's the question of price. Analysts have said the
junk bonds are worth about 80% of their value, though they've
traded recently at 40%. Ingersoll offered 55% for the senior
bonds and 25% for the junior bonds, said Mr. Rubin. "We think
. . . bondholders are probably willing to accept somewhere
around 80% and 40%, respectively, if it's resolved quickly,"
he said.
   Mr. Rubin said that if Ingersoll doesn't reset its bonds,
"it's a monetary default and we could accelerate the
indebtedness, and I sincerely doubt they could pay off the
entire principal amount in response." Such a crisis could tip
Ingersoll into bankruptcy proceedings, said Mr. Rubin. But
people close to Ingersoll say bondholders would also be hurt
by losses and delays in payment that would result from a
bankrupcty filing.

   From a speech by Paul H. Nitze on the occasion of the
inauguration of the new building of the Council on Foreign
Relations in Washington, March 12:

<TEXT>
   For the Council on Foreign Relations to have its own
quarters here in Washington reflects a changed era. In the
twenties and thirties, New York was not only the financial,
industrial and press capital of the country, but prided
itself on being its policy center as well. The State
Department and White House might conduct diplomacy in peace
and raise and command armies in war, but policy was made by
serious people, men with a longer view, i.e. the great men of
finance and their advisers. New York was where they were to
be found. . . . In the postwar years the Council has
continued to represent an invaluable way for many of us
Washingtonians to tap the intellectual resources of the
enormously important New York business and intellectual
community. But the centrality of Washington to the
relationship has increased.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Art Theft (and Sometimes Recovery): News From IFAR

   Although New York is America's leading art market, its
art-recovery law has not been a shining exemplar of Yankee
plain-spokenness. Indeed, New York has no statute expressly
for the recovery of stolen art, only an idiosyncratic muddle
of case law. Clarity, however, may be just around the corner.
The state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, now has an
opportunity to define the law, in a ruling expected after
Labor Day.
   Just last year, a New York Supreme Court judge (the
state's lowest judicial level) rebuffed the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, saying it could not sue to recover a
Chagall gouache from Mrs. Jules Lubell because, since the
work's disappearance in the mid-1960s, the museum had taken
no action to report or recover it. But the Guggenheim is
back, having taken its case to the Appellate Division, whose
five judges decided unanimously in late January that the
museum's inaction should not prohibit it from bringing suit.
The Appellate Division's opinion said such cases should be
determined neither by statutes of limitations nor by tests of
due diligence, but rather by a court deciding whether both
parties had behaved reasonably at the time. Mrs. Lubell then
asked to have the Court of Appeals rule on the question, and
on March 29, despite the unanimity of the intermediate court,
it was decided that the highest court would do so.

   Litigation to recover stolen art is not rare. Right now in
New York, the Republic of Turkey is waiting to hear if its
suit against the Metropolitan Museum of Art, claiming
ownership of the Lydian Hoard, more than 200 works of ancient
silver, will be heard. The Netherlands is suing New York
developer and art collector Ian Woodner to get a Hans Baldung
Grien drawing it contends was in a collection stolen by the
Nazis.
   Earlier this year, Lebanon and Yugoslavia each asked a New
York court to freeze Sotheby's proposed sale of the Sevso
Treasure, a magnificent group of late Roman silver reportedly
purchased by the Marquess of Northampton in Switzerland in
the 1970s. The treasure is said to have an export license
from Lebanon, but Yugoslavia's papers assert that the
treasure was excavated in the early '70s near Pula in the
Yugoslavian province of Istria, where the Sevso family was
prominent, that its export was illegal, and that Yugoslavian
title to the silver is superior to any other.
   The New York Court of Appeals ruling will affect not only
the suits currently under consideration, but the behavior of
people in the art market. Every day, situations crop up in
which people require legal counsel, as they contemplate
acquiring works without provenance or decide whether or not
to return works of art requested by original owners.
   A Connecticut man came in to IFAR to inquire whether a
17th-century English clock he'd bought at an antique shop in
Valhalla, N.Y., had been stolen; we informed him that a
Manhattan dealer had reported the theft of one that appeared
to be identical in 1977. The clock now is worth upward of
$200,000, and attorneys for the two parties are negotiating.
   A private art dealer recently called IFAR's Art Theft
Archive to see if the beautiful Chagall oil painting he was
being offered was hot. He didn't know the sellers, and the
price was too low, he believed; "I'm not that lucky," he told
us. He wasn't. The painting had been stolen in Baltimore in
1970. Its current value is more than $1 million. Lawyers have
arranged the return.
   Civil suits are much more common than criminal actions in
cases of art theft. But April 30 is the trial date for
Madison Avenue art dealer Michael Weisbrod, who is accused of
buying two Chinese porcelains and an 18th-century pink coral
carving knowing they were stolen.
   The thieves had robbed museums in Detroit, Columbus, Ohio,
Albany, N.Y., Syracuse, N.Y., Boston and Baltimore of
decorative-arts items including a silver Tiffany pitcher; a
ceramic masterpiece of 1910, Adelaide Alsop Robineau's
"Scarab Vase"; the Chinese porcelains; and a group of English
antique pocket watches. They were caught after an attempt to
sell the watches. Mr. Weisbrod's attorney, Richard Berne,
told IFAR that he and his client are "confident that he will
be exonerated."

   THIRD WORLD'S CHILD LABOR

   Millions of children are working the streets of Third
World cities, shining shoes, washing cars or prostituting
themselves, the International Labor Organization reported.
   "Youngsters working as household domestic servants may be
the most vulnerable and exploited children of all and the
most difficult to protect," the ILO said.
   The 60-page ILO report said improvements in industrialized
nations had yet to penetrate the Third World, where areas of
child exploitation remained hidden from public scrutiny.
"Their existence is often kept under a tight veil of secrecy
and isolation," it said.
   Among positive developments, the ILO reported a decline of
child labor in mills and factories of mainstream industries,
chiefly because modern technology required skilled or
semiskilled manpower.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA'S LISTLESS ECONOMY
                                                                                                       

   China's listless economy won't begin to recover until the
second half of the year, jeopardizing the nation's
industrial-growth target of 5% to 6% this year, said Zhang
Zhongji of the State Statistical Bureau. He said that the
economy had failed to respond to pump-priming measures during
the first quarter and that loans intended to bolster slumping
industries had contributed mainly to further overstocking of
unsold products. "There has been no fundamental change in . .
. stagnation in industrial production and poor economic
efficiency," Mr. Zhang said.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPE'S LARGEST GAS STATION
                                                                                                       

   Deutsche BP AG will build a gas station in Dresden, East
Germany, that will be the largest gas station in Europe,
according to the East German news agency ADN. The West German
unit of British Petroleum PLC will also be the first West
German company to build a gas station in East Germany when it
constructs a 48-pump station near the Dresden-North Autobahn.
The station will be under a 5,000-square-foot roof and will
offer eight different types of fuel, ADN said.
                                                                                                       

   SONY TO INCREASE IMPORTS
                                                                                                       

   Sony Corp. announced a plan to increase imports and
overseas production over the next four years. Joining other
Japanese companies that recently announced similar programs,
Sony said it intends to increase its imports 3.5 times by the
end of fiscal 1993, to 120 billion yen ($762.6 million) from
their fiscal 1989 level of 34.3 billion yen. Imports would
include Sony color televisions from the U.S., audio equipment
from Asia and audio and video software from the company's CBS
Records Inc. and Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
subsidiaries.
                                                                                                       

   CANADA'S GREEN INDICATORS
                                                                                                       

   The Canadian government has established a task force to
develop a set of 20 to 30 "green" indicators that will give
the public a regular report on the state of the environment.
Canadian officials said the indicators could ultimately be
linked with traditional economic statistics to help
illustrate whether an economic upturn is being made at the
expense of the environment. Anne Kerr, heading the task force
for Environment Canada, said it's doubtful the group will
come up with an overall "green index" but instead plans to
devise several indicators to track such basics as the quality
of water and air.
                                                                                                       

   `ECONOMIC TERRORISTS' IN IRAN
                                                                                                       

   To combat consumer shortages, Iran's parliament approved
the death penalty for people convicted of hoarding,
profiteering and black-market dealings, Tehran Radio
reported. The broadcast said that "if profiteering or
hoarding is meant to counter the Islamic Republic's
establishment, the profiteer and hoarder will be executed."
Iranian officials call such individuals "economic
terrorists."
                                                                                                       

   DOING BUSINESS WITH VIETNAM
                                                                                                       

   The Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers of Commerce
adopted a resolution urging the Bush administration to lift
restrictions preventing Americans from doing business with
Vietnam.
   The council, which represents 19 chamber chapters in the
Asia-Pacific area, said it supported "immediate removal of
restrictions on U.S. trade and investment with Vietnam." The
economic sanctions, it said, "severely impact American
competitiveness in the region."
   There has been only one known exception to the U.S.
embargo, which has blocked trade since the fall of South
Vietnam's U.S.-supported government in 1975. In January, the
Atlanta-based Cable News Network, a unit of Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., was allowed to provide ground
receivers that will enable Vietnam to pick up CNN's satellite
signals.
   The Bush administration is adamant that ties with Vietnam
stay severed until, among other steps, Hanoi agrees to
on-site verification that Vietnamese soldiers have left
Cambodia.

   A senior Chinese police official said international
terrorists were planning to sabotage the Asian Games in
Beijing this September. Liu Wen, a top official for combating
terrorism, said, "To prevent terrorism {at the games}, we
have ordered our police units to guard against this and asked
our international friends for help." . . . Christian leaders
in Israel ordered all their holy sites to close this Friday
for one day to protest Israeli government support for a new
Jewish settlement in Jerusalem's Christian quarter.

   TORONTO -- Imperial Oil Ltd. said it hopes to raise about
one billion Canadian dollars (US$861.5 million) from asset
sales by the end of this year to help reduce its high debt
levels.
   Ronald Brenneman, senior vice president and chief
financial officer of Imperial Oil, told shareholders at the
annual meeting that in this year's first quarter, the
integrated oil and gas company completed the sale of more
than C$200 million of oil and gas properties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Imperial Oil, in which New York-based Exxon Corp. holds a
69.9% stake, said last Friday that it agreed to sell its 23%
stake in Interhome Energy Inc. to Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.
for C$492 million.
   Mr. Brenneman said other "non-core assets" are up for sale
this year, including some refining and marketing properties.
He didn't elaborate.
   He said that the asset sales, increased cash flow (net
income plus depreciation) and reinvested stock dividends will
combine to cut debt to less than C$3 billion by the end of
this year from about C$4.4 billion last Dec. 31.
   Arden Haynes, chairman and chief executive officer,
predicted that for 1990, Imperial Oil "will probably match"
its 1989 net income of C$456 million, or C$2.54 a share, if
the asset sales go smoothly.
   Mr. Haynes said the company's ability to match 1989
results depends on interest rates and the cost of financing
its debt, as well as how quickly it is able to conclude the
asset sales.
   The company yesterday reported first-quarter net income
rose 33% to C$150 million, or 79 Canadian cents a share, from
C$113 million, or 68 Canadian cents a share. Revenue rose 33%
to C$2.63 billion from C$1.98 billion. The latest earnings
include a C$19 million gain from the sale of the oil and gas
properties.

   TOKYO -- The Tokyo office of CS First Boston Inc. was hit
by its second high-level resignation in a month, as the
brokerage firm's top Japanese executive resigned to join a
rival Swiss firm.
   Allen D. Wheat, the new head of CS First Boston in Asia,
said in a statement to employees that Keisuke Inaba,
president and branch manager of CS First Boston (Japan) Ltd.,
resigned because he said he wanted to work in a smaller
office and had "a belief that he's contributed all he can
toward expanding our effort in Japan."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He said Mr. Inaba will join UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
International Ltd., the securities subsidiary of Union Bank
of Switzerland. The controlling shareholder of CS First
Boston is Credit Suisse, another major Swiss bank.
   Mr. Inaba, a former executive at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and
Kidder Peabody International Corp., was out of the country
and couldn't be reached for comment.
   His resignation came just three weeks after James M.
Walsh, chairman of CS First Boston in Japan, quit. Mr. Walsh
said he resigned after the firm asked him to move to London.
   But employees at CS First Boston have speculated that the
arrival in February of Mr. Wheat, former chairman of Bankers
Trust Co.'s international arm, created friction at the firm
that prompted Messrs. Walsh and Inaba to leave.
   Mr. Wheat said CS First Boston will continue its expansion
in Asia, despite the departures. "Moving forward in a
changing environment is never easy," he said in the
annoucement to employees.
   With a staff of more than 400, memberships on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange and the Tokyo International Financial Futures
Exchange, and a representative office in Osaka, CS First
Boston is among the largest foreign brokerage houses in
Japan.

   I had never thought to cry "Et tu, Brute]" to the
editorial writers of the Journal. Your arguments, whether or
not one agrees with them, are generally cogent, and at times
elegantly expressed. Always, in my memory, they have been
models of diction.
   Yet on March 20 you told us that Congress continues to
"flaunt" (a word meaning "to display ostentatiously") the
revised minimum-wage law. You meant "flout" ("to mock or
insult; to treat with contempt"). No Caesar I, but you have
plunged a dagger deep into the heart of this old lover of the
English language.

   Your message is well worth an editorial, if not a
front-page article, but the first sentence probably confused
many readers. "Flaunt" generally means to show off
ostentatiously, as in "flaunting his superiority." Instead,
Congress is flouting the minimum-wage law, treating it with
scornful disregard. While "flaunt" does carry this as a
secondary meaning, its use in this context was confusing,
since Congress often trumpets its newest legislation.

   Tsk. To flout flout you flaunt flaunt.
   Instead, you should flaunt flout and so flout flaunt.
   William W. Hall

   You say Congress is going to "flaunt a major piece of
recently enacted federal legislation." No doubt this is the
result of a misquotation on congressional defiance of
minimum-wage legislation. No member of Congress said, "I
flaunt to be alone." There was, however a clear chorus of
"Flout, flout, damned spot]"
   This modest adjustment to reality is offered in a spirit
of constructive good will and is not intended to flout
erudition or flaunt convention.

   Congress's Terms:
   Just Fine
   As They Are

   The Democrats have few peers when it comes to
rationalizing their inability to win the presidency: one time
it's their clinker candidate, another it's the superficial
television appeal of Ronald Reagan or the "unfair" hardball
tactics of GOP strategist Lee Atwater.
   These are exercises in self-delusion. The Democrats lost
five of the past six presidential races because most
Americans have more confidence in the Republicans on the
broad issues of the economy and peace and war.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet, during those same two decades, the Republicans'
strength actually declined at every other political level,
including Congress. Today the Democrats enjoy the same
55-to-45 advantage in the Senate that they had 20 years ago.
They have 15 more House members. The GOP, like the Democrats
on the presidential level, offer all manner of
rationalizations: redistricting, the campaign financing
system and the generous perquisites of incumbency.
   Now there's a new GOP-inspired initiative to do something
about it: constitutionally limiting congressional terms to 12
years. Former Republican office holders and some GOP
political consultants, together with a sprinkling of
disgruntled or "populist" Democrats, have banded together to
form Americans to Limit Congressional terms. The idea
commands majority support among the public.
   The objective, they claim, is to return to the "citizen
legislators" that the Founding Fathers envisioned. The real
goal, however, is to break the decades-old Democratic lock on
Congress.
   There's nothing wrong with posturing for political
advantage, but the term-limitation proposal is a bad idea
that likely would have unintended consequences. It's another
of those schemes to take politics out of politics. We don't
want to take businessmen out of business or athletes out of
sports or doctors out of medicine. Nor should we try to limit
the role of politicians in politics.
   Term limitation, by removing years of expertise from
Capitol Hill, would increase the power of the permanent
bureaucracy. "Power would flow from elected to unelected
officials," says Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution.
   It would enhance too the power of special interests.
Instead of fresh-faced citizen legislators we'd end up with
men and women who knew that after 12 years they had to seek a
new line of work, most probably with the very interests that
are lobbying them. "Most members today don't think about what
they're going to do next until their last term," notes Rep.
Vin Weber, a conservative Minnesota Republican. "But with a
term limitation, the clock would start ticking right away
with members thinking, `What am I going to do when I get out
of here in 12 years?' For many, the obvious answer would be
to cultivate a relationship with those who can help you
later."
   Moreover, the premise that this would enhance GOP
prospects is dubious. In the 1980s, while Ronald Reagan was
riding high, there were 147 wide-open contests for House
seats -- elections in which there was no incumbent because of
either retirement or death; there was a net Democratic gain
in those contests of 1.
   For years Republicans have been insisting they would
dominate politics in the South as soon as the old-time
Democrats retired. In 1981, at the dawn of the Reagan era,
Virginia seemed the model, with Republicans controlling nine
of the 10 House seats; eight years later the Democrats had
won back half of the House seats.
   But this isn't simply a Southern phenomenon. Going back to
1972, Republicans eyed the third congressional district on
the New Jersey shore with its relatively affluent retirees.
When incumbent Democrat Jim Howard died in 1988 the GOP saw a
golden opportunity, particularly in a year in which George
Bush would carry the district by more than 60,000 votes. The
result: Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat, won by 10,000 votes.
   The notion of a permanently embedded Congress is an
exaggeration; two-thirds of the current members have been
there for less than 12 years. To be sure, there are some
extraordinary advantages of incumbency: campaign finance laws
and mailing privileges, are major assets. And since the
Democrats control most state legislatures, gerrymandering of
congressional districts probably adds between a half dozen
and a dozen seats to the Democratic majority in the House.
   But far more importantly, Democrats dominate congressional
elections for the same reasons that Republicans dominate
presidential elections: The voters think they're better
suited.
   That was dramatically evident in a Wall Street Journal-NBC
News survey in November. On the broad national challenges
pertaining to presidential leadership, the Republicans win in
a walk: a 43%-to-13% edge on dealing with the Russians, 40%
to 26% on dealing with the economy and 31% to 17% on keeping
world peace. But when it came to the day-to-day
quality-of-life issues, voters are just as decidedly
pro-Democratic: 36% to 15% on protecting the environment, 30%
to 15% on education and 44% to 21% on helping the middle
class.
   "Just as Democrats have not gotten their act together in
speaking coherently about broad national interests neither
have the Republicans gotten our act together about how
government responds to personal and local needs," says Rep.
Vin Weber. "That is much more our problem than incumbency."
Republicans like Rep. Weber -- and Jack Kemp and Newt
Gingrich -- have been trying to fashion responsive Republican
alternatives, but they still have a ways to go.
   Republicans also would do well to remember 40 years ago
when they used term limitations to do what they never could
do to the late Franklin Roosevelt in life: enact the 22nd
Amendment limiting presidents to two terms. Since then it has
affected two presidents: Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.

   ATLANTA -- Ray Howell, a key witness in a federal probe of
political contributions by a Southern Co. unit, pleaded
guilty to contempt and tax charges. And he agreed to
cooperate in a continuing investigation related to the giant
electric utility.
   Mr. Howell, who was a vendor for Southern's Pensacola,
Fla., Gulf Power Co. unit, vanished from an Atlanta hotel
room in December 1988 on the eve of his scheduled appearance
before a federal grand jury. He went into hiding for a year
but surrendered to authorities in December, saying he had run
out of money.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators were expected to question Mr. Howell
yesterday and today, his attorney said. Individuals familiar
with the investigation say he can give details of the roles
played by others in the political-contributions scheme.
   In October, Gulf Power pleaded guilty to two felony
charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions
and tax evasion and paid a $500,000 fine. Papers filed in a
federal court in Atlanta in that case alleged that Gulf Power
used Mr. Howell's Design Associates Inc. to channel money to
the 1988 campaign of Florida state Sen. W.D. Childers.
Federal law prohibits utility holding companies from making
political contributions.
   Gulf Power's plea ended the case against it, but it
doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing charges against
individuals, such as employees or politicians. Neither Sen.
Childers nor any other elected official or employee has been
charged with any wrongdoing.
   In an interview, Sen. Childers said: "I don't have any
knowledge, and I haven't seen any proof that Gulf Power
funneled any money to my campaign."
   John Hutchinson, a spokesman for Gulf Power, said Mr.
Howell's plea "closes another chapter."
   Mr. Howell's contempt charge relates to his failure to
appear before the grand jury; the tax charge involves filing
a false corporate tax return in 1987. He faces as long as
five years in prison on the tax charge; his sentence for the
contempt count is largely up to the court's discretion. He is
scheduled to be sentenced June 27.
   Suzanne Hashimi, Mr. Howell's public defender, declined to
discuss what Mr. Howell might tell investigators.
   Mr. Howell wants to go into the federal witness protection
program, his attorney said. As part of the plea bargain
agreement, federal prosecutors said they will help him apply
for the program "should the circumstances warrant."
   Ms. Hashimi declined to say whether Mr. Howell, who is
jailed in the federal prison in Atlanta, has been threatened,
but she said she is worried about his safety. "Only a fool
wouldn't be, with Jake Horton dead," Ms. Hashimi said. "Part
of the reason he is not on bond is for his own protection."
   Jacob F. "Jake" Horton, a Gulf Power executive who oversaw
the contributions scheme, was killed in a fiery crash of a
corporate plane last April. The National Transportation
Safety Board is expected to release a final report on the
crash soon.
   In a counterclaim to a civil suit filed in a federal court
in Pensacola by Mr. Horton's estate, Southern Co. Services
Inc. asserts that Mr. Horton deliberately caused the crash
himself. Just before the crash, Mr. Horton had been advised
that a Gulf Power audit committee had recommended his ouster
because of invoice irregularities related to the political
contributions scheme.
   A federal grand jury is continuing other aspects of its
Southern Co. investigation, including an examination of
whether a method of accounting for spare parts resulted in a
deliberate underpayment of federal income taxes and a probe
into certain pension-fund transactions.

   Advanced Polymer Systems Inc. said it reached a broad
development and marketing agreement with Pfizer Inc. that
could result in products that add "millions of dollars" to
Advanced Polymer's revenue stream over the next several
years.
   Advanced Polymer, Redwood City, Calif., is a five-year-old
biotechnology concern that has developed and patented a
"microsponge." The porous, polymer-based, microscopic sponge
can be programmed, through manufacturing techniques, to
control the release of a variety of substances -- from
cosmetics to flavor additives.

   John H. Williford, Advanced Polymer's chairman and chief
executive officer, said the two companies will carry on joint
efforts to research microsponge applications for various
products. These may include anti-fouling agents for marine
paints, sustained-release fragrances for air fresheners and
long-lasting, time-release adhesives.
   He said that during the 18-month agreement New York-based
Pfizer has agreed to pay all research and development costs
on a per-product basis, in exchange for exclusive marketing
rights for any products stemming from such research. Advanced
Polymer would also receive licensing fees and royalties from
the sale of any products, Mr. Williford said.
   The arrangement provides a generous amount of development
capital to Advanced Polymer, which had 1989 revenue of only
$2.8 million. Mr. Williford declined to estimate Pfizer's
total potential investment in R&amp;D efforts but said it would
amount to "several hundred thousand dollars" on each product
developed.
   Pfizer has also agreed to fund the cost of any additional
manufacturing capacity for production of products flowing
from the collaboration, Mr. Williford said.

   TOKYO -- Most Americans are used to seeing Japan's big
auto makers roll all over Detroit. But here's a surprise:
They're also running some of their smaller Japanese rivals
right off the road.
   "It's clear that Japan simply has too many auto
companies," says Paul Fraker, an analyst who tracks Japan's
11 car and truck companies for London-based Baring
Securities. "By the end of the decade, competition will thin
the ranks of Japanese auto makers to four or five groups."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first strong signal of this impending consolidation
comes from Fuji Heavy Industries Inc., best known for its
Subaru cars. Fuji recently forecast an operating loss of
nearly 23 billion yen ($145.6 million) for the fiscal year
ended March 31. That's seven times the loss it was predicting
last fall. And earlier this month, the other shoe fell: Fuji
President Toshijiro Tajima said he will yield the reins to a
former high executive of Nissan Motor Co.
   Officially, Fuji remains independent. In reality, Nissan,
Fuji's largest holder with a 4.3% stake, will step in to
ensure Fuji's survival and call the shots at its ailing
cousin. It's a Chrysler-type bailout, Japanese-style, without
legislative hearings or public controversy.
   As a group, the Japanese auto makers are still clearly
winners. They took an unprecedented 27.7% of U.S. car sales
in the first quarter, and last year auto sales in Japan
itself rose 8% to a record. But Japan's car makers aren't all
alike. Consider what the big ones -- Nissan, Toyota Motor
Corp. and Honda Motor Co. -- are doing to their smaller
Japanese rivals:
   -- Fuji's vehicle sales in Japan dropped 5% last year, but
that was the good news. Sales of its Subaru of America
affiliate tumbled 13% and then another 35% in the 1990 first
quarter, just as Fuji was gearing up its first U.S. factory.
Fuji's projected operating loss will be the company's first
since its shares were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in
1960.
   -- Daihatsu Motor Co.'s domestic auto operations sustained
an 18% drop in earnings in the fiscal year ended March 31,
analysts estimate. The culprits: A decline in sales of
minicars, the company's main product, and an embarrassing
recall of the company's first family-sized compact, the
Applause. Daihatsu, already 14%-owned by Toyota, wants Toyota
to raise its stake to 20% and assist in product development.
   -- Suzuki Motor Co.'s vehicle sales in Japan dipped a
modest 2% last year, but the company hit a buzzsaw in the
U.S. Consumer Reports Magazine labeled the Samurai, a tiny,
Jeep-like vehicle, unsafe. Suzuki's U.S. sales plunged 48% in
1989 and were down 36% in the 1990 first quarter. Suzuki is
fighting back with new management, new advertising and new
models, but against heavy odds.
   All this makes Japan's smaller car companies ripe for the
sort of consolidation sweeping the rest of the auto industry
world-wide. In recent years, some of the world's best-known
automotive marques have surrendered their independence:
Jaguar to Ford Motor Co. and Saab to General Motors Corp.
Last February, Sweden's AB Volvo and France's Renault S.A.
announced a broad alliance that will be cemented by
cross-shareholdings and cooperation on a range of products.
   Only the Japanese companies remained unaffected by this
survival-driven urge to merge. Aided by their prosperity
during much of the 1980s, they were becoming more independent
of each other and of their foreign partners.
   Even though Nissan, for example, is Fuji's largest
shareholder, Fuji stopped assembling cars for Nissan in 1986
and declared that in the future it wouldn't rely so heavily
on the larger company. Last year, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
bought back a big chunk of its stock owned by Chrysler Corp.,
reducing the U.S. company's stake to 12% from about 22%. GM
recently trimmed its stake in Isuzu Motors Ltd.
   Now, though, the pendulum may be swinging back toward
consolidation. "It's a return to the beginning," says Atsushi
Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice president for finance.
   The effects on consumers in the U.S. and Japan aren't
clear. Consolidation could take years, and well-known brand
names, such as Subaru, aren't likely to disappear. Fewer
independent competitors could lead to higher prices, but
plenty of competition is still left.
   The causes of consolidation are easier to pinpoint. The
Japanese yen nearly doubled in dollar value between 1985 and
1989. Japan's auto makers raised prices sharply to
compensate, Detroit got more competitive, and suddenly the
U.S. stopped being a sure-fire growth market for the
Japanese. The yen has slumped about 30% in recent months, but
no longer is selling Japanese cars in the U.S. a cakewalk.
   Back in Japan, meanwhile, the government eased the tax
bite on large cars, and their sales surged at the expense of
minicars. Toyota and Nissan racked up sales gains exceeding
15% last year, while sales of minicars -- the core products
at Fuji and Suzuki as well as Daihatsu -- fell 10%.
   Minicar sales may rebound this year because the government
now allows them to have bigger engines. Nonetheless, the
future for minicars isn't bright because the newly rich
Japanese want what Americans have wanted for decades: bigger,
plusher automobiles. The minicar specialists have to change.
   "Everyone has to expand their product lines, and they just
can't do it by themselves," says Takeo Fujii, a
research-department executive at Industrial Bank of Japan,
Fuji's lender and second-largest shareholder. "One hit, and
you're safe for a while. But one flop, and you're out."
   Fuji prospered for years because it found a niche:
four-wheel drive. Most companies confined four-wheel drive to
pickups or utility vehicles, but Fuji put it on cars and
station wagons, and won fans in snowy New England and Rocky
Mountain states. Americans bought 183,000 Subarus in 1986,
twice the level of a decade earlier.
   Then things went awry. Sport utility vehicles surged in
popularity in the U.S., attracting Subaru buyers. More
companies started putting four-wheel drive on cars. Fuji was
slow to respond, especially in the U.S., where it is the only
Japanese auto maker to import and market cars through an
independent distributor. (Fuji owns 49.6% of Subaru of
America, but coordination between them can be cumbersome.)
   Last year, Fuji counterattacked by launching the Subaru
Legacy, a mainstream family car. "You could call the Legacy a
make-or-break car," says Stephen Usher, an analyst at
Kleinwort Benson International Inc. in Tokyo. "So far, it
isn't really making it." Although the Legacy gets good marks
from car-enthusiast publications, it's aimed squarely at the
Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
   "We sure wish {Legacy} sales had been higher," concedes
Thomas R. Gibson, the president of Subaru of America. "But
actually, they aren't as disappointing as some people think."
The most typical Legacy buyer, he says, is a prior Subaru
owner, but the second and third largest categories are Camry
and Accord owners. Subaru's problems were somewhat
predictable, Mr. Gibson adds, because "we spent 20 years in
subcompact market, and now we're suddenly moving into a
market that's a little more upscale."
   Nonetheless, dealers in both the U.S. and Japan are
moaning. In suburban Los Angeles, for example, Culver City
Subaru is selling only about six cars a month, down from 26 a
month four years ago. "There just isn't a keen interest in
Subaru products," complains Philip Miller, the sales manager.
"There's nothing I can do. Unfortunately, I'm handling a
product that isn't doing well."
   In Tokyo's Ark Hills financial center, Tadashi Uematsu has
much the same complaint. "I wish more young people would come
in," says Mr. Uematsu, the general manager of the Chuo Subaru
Motor Co. dealership. "Things are pretty tough." His first
hour on the job one morning last week was interrupted by just
one shopper.
   Fuji's bankers at Industrial Bank of Japan saw the
problems deepening last summer. So they sent an IBJ
executive, Motomu Toshiya, to become a senior managing
director of Fuji. But five months later, Mr. Toshiya died
unexpectedly. Since then, Fuji has been involved in corporate
power struggles of the sort that are rare in consensus-minded
Japan.
   First, Fuji bid $147 million, or $6 a share, to buy the
rest of Subaru of America. Subaru balked at the price and
hasn't budged. So now, Fuji and Subaru officials must keep at
arms' length in the board room while trying to work hand in
hand in the showroom.
   Then, with Fuji angling for control of Subaru, officials
of Nissan and IBJ started haggling over control of Fuji
itself. Both Nissan and IBJ, longtime business partners,
wanted to install their own man at Fuji's helm. Much as it
often happens in Detroit, the "car guys" were fighting the
finance people over control.
   At Fuji, the car guys won, partly because Mr. Tajima, the
president who presided over Fuji's decline, himself came from
IBJ. He will remain at Fuji as the chairman, but in Japan the
president is the top executive. Fuji's new president will be
Isamu Kawai, a 68-year-old former high executive of Nissan.
As the current president of Nissan Diesel Co., he is
well-regarded for pulling the Nissan truck-making affiliate
out of a slump.
   Already, Fuji has followed Nissan by abolishing dress
codes for home-office employees and permitting flexible work
schedules. More substantive moves will follow: Fuji is likely
to use its idle plant capacity in Japan to assemble cars for
Nissan again, and the two companies will cooperate in
developing and marketing cars. Some analysts expect an
eventual full merger.
   How will Japan's other producers fare in the expected
consolidation? Toyota will expand its role at Daihatsu,
experts predict. Japan's truck specialists, Hino Motors Ltd.
and Nissan Diesel, will remain closely tied to Toyota and
Nissan, respectively.
   Mitsubishi is pulling away from Chrysler but exploring
closer ties with Daimler-Benz AG of Germany. Honda, as
always, will go it alone. Mazda Motor Co. and Isuzu already
have big brothers; Ford owns 25% of Mazda, GM 38% of Isuzu.
   The wild card is Suzuki, 5%-owned by GM but the only small
Japanese car maker to remain truly independent. "Suzuki's
position," a Japanese auto executive says, "might become
delicate." A Suzuki spokesman in Japan says that in the
future the company, like other auto makers, may need to put
more emphasis on cooperation. He adds, however, "We think we
have to continue on our own."
   In any case, the events at Fuji show that being Japanese
doesn't guarantee any car company immunity from global
competition. "Will all 11 Japanese vehicle manufacturers
remain independent? I don't think so," says Stephen E.
Marvin, a senior auto analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities
Ltd. in Tokyo. "Fuji is the first sign of things to come."

   Melting the Ice: Witt and Boitano on Tour

   New Haven, Conn. -- For Katarina Witt, this is the best
and the worst of times. East Germany's gift to figure skating
is finally realizing what not long ago seemed an impossible
dream: co-starring with American Olympian Brian Boitano in
their own globe-hopping ice show. But the same freedom that's
putting Witt in control of passport and purse strings has
turned the rest of the 24-year-old's world topsy-turvy.
   Once a proud model of socialist rectitude, East Germany's
most prominent athletic champion has become the equally
reviled symbol of the ancien regime. Witt's erstwhile
comrades are demanding to know about all sorts of things --
like the country bungalow, the Volkswagen car. Like the
reported under-the-table performance bonuses. And while Witt
can leave the country, she can't escape the questions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I was very disappointed when I heard about all these
things that the government did," the skater said during a
break in rehearsals for the tour, a pensive look playing
across her cover-girl features. "But I always thought the
system must tell the truth and I believed it. Now you find
out they lied a lot, and I was really disappointed. I mean
I'm very thankful I had the chance to skate but now I feel
that we athletes were used.
   "And it's hard for me to change the past, too," Witt
continued, with as much care as she used to trace compulsory
figures. "Suddenly everything what you learned before,
everything you did, was wrong. I'm just totally confused in
my head and I need time . . . that's why it's hard for me to
answer all these questions."
   For the next six months Witt hopes to let her skating do
the talking. That's how long the company of 14 will play
arenas in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan on a tour that
began last week.
   Ironically, "Brian Boitano and Katarina Witt Skating"
began as a statement of sorts. "I thought of it as an
East-West thing, a kind of peace tour," explained the
26-year-old Boitano, who came up with the idea of a
production uniting skaters from the U.S., Canada, the
U.S.S.R. and the G.D.R. in the warm afterglow of his and
Witt's victories at the '88 Olympics.
   Back then the thought of the Sweetheart of Karl Marx Stadt
teaming up with the Bay Area's Golden Boy seemed rather
farfetched -- especially to East German authorities. Witt
says it took six months of wheedling -- and something of a
snow job -- for her to win approval of her first project with
Boitano, an '88 ABC TV special. "I didn't ever really tell
them what the story (a love story) is about," she giggled. "I
just said, `Well, they're going to be showing pieces of East
Germany.' "
   The authorities permitted the pair to reteam for the movie
"Carmen on Ice" (watch for rebroadcasts of the film, which
shows off Witt's considerable acting as well as skating
skills, on HBO). And they allowed Witt to join the European
tour of "Holiday on Ice" -- in return for a chunk of hard
currency. Witt got to keep a percentage of her fees, but
declines to discuss specifics beyond saying, "It was not nice
the way they handled it."
   Despite the mint East Germany might have made, Witt's
sports federation nixed many of the offers that came her way.
But all of this began to change last fall when the Wall came
down -- while Witt was in Seville filming "Carmen." "She was
excited but I think she was more stunned," recalled Boitano,
one of the few to penetrate Witt's personal wall. (The
friendship has prompted rumors of romance, which both deny;
up close they seem more like a playful brother and sister.)
"Kati was . . . nervous to go back home because she didn't
know if it was going to be the same country."
   She had every reason to be apprehensive. Back in the U.S.
following the filming, Boitano was alarmed by reports of an
anti-athlete -- particularly an anti-Witt-backlash. "I called
her in East Germany and said, `You got to get out of there]'
" Witt reassured her friend that things were not that bad,
and stood her ground.
   Now, Witt maintains, the worst is over. "Ja, there was
resentment, but I think this is gone because they really see
we did hard work," she stated. "I was upset when they said we
were privileged and getting this and this, but I think we
deserved it. Like here in this country, too, if you're a very
good athlete you make so much money and you're treated so
nicely and it's just the same -- but on another level. If I
would have lived here I would have made millions, you know. I
would be safe until the end of my life already."
   As it is, the two-time Olympic gold medalist still has to
skate for her supper. And she couldn't have found a classier
showcase than "Brian Boitano and Katarina Witt Skating."
   From the opening moments of the performance here at the
Coliseum last week, the difference between this and the
typical glitzy ice extravaganza is clear. The first thing you
hear in the dimly lit arena is the sound of blades. The first
you see -- barely -- is a solitary figure swooping across the
ice. It's Boitano, and just as suddenly he's gone. A solo
piano begins to play and out glides the company in costumes
as elegantly simple as the music, joining hands for an
instant to form moving figures, then as gracefully
dispersing.
   Some of the faces are familiar, like '84 Olympic silver
medalist Rosalynn Sumners and former world pairs champions
Elena Valova and Oleg Vasiliev. Others aren't, but by the end
of the evening will be, such as Canada's kinetic Gary Beacom,
who's created a whole new movement vocabulary for himself. As
they skate off, the piano piece slides seamlessly into a
ballad (both are by Boitano favorite David Foster), and the
lights pick out the most famous face of all: Katarina Witt.
   In her filmy high-necked white dress, chestnut hair caught
up in a French braid, Witt looks like an ice maiden Renoir
might have imagined. As she skates through director Sandra
Bezic's flowing choreography there's a lovely delicacy to the
way she moves her arms and hands, a lightness to her jumps.
When she swirls into a layback spin, her long neck arching
above the icicle -- like ribbons now fanning out from her
costume, she is picture-perfect.
   As the cheers die down her cavalier, Boitano, appears to
present Witt with a red rose before she skates off. It's one
of the graceful transitions Bezic, a former Canadian pairs
champion who also choreographed the "Carmen" film, uses to
maintain the show's flow. Then up come the stirring strains
of "Man of La Mancha," and Boitano charges into the kind of
commanding, athletically challenging display nobody does
better.
   He rips off the triples that seem to come out of thin air,
testing himself in ways most audiences won't even appreciate
-- for instance slowing his momentum with a spread-eagle
circle before his already impossibly difficult Tano Triple.
You see why Boitano hopes to defend his Olympic crown. (Next
month the International Skating Union is scheduled to rule on
allowing professionals to compete.)
   But this evening isn't really about jumps, triple or
otherwise. At heart the show is what the title says: Brian
Boitano and Katarina Witt skating. Alone and together.
   In their two solos apiece and their two paired numbers,
Bezic shows us skaters who are in some respects worlds apart
yet share so much. Witt's routines reveal a woman of many
faces -- first the innocent, then a fanny-waggling chorine,
and finally the fated Carmen -- but she always is the
charismatic performer who feeds off the audience. Boitano is
more solitary in his virtuosity, constantly stretching
himself to go higher, further, faster.
   And yet when they come together in the climactic "Carmen"
number, adapted from the film, the two make a convincing
couple. In this passionate pasodoble they share not only
longing looks but a common musicality and elegance of line.
Together and terrific.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission
agreed to investigate a complaint by SGS-Thomson
Microelectronics Inc. that its patents are being infringed by
imports of computer memory chips made by a South Korean
company.
   SGS-Thomson, based in Carrollton, Texas, said Hyundai
Electronics Industries Co. and its California-based
subsidiary, Hyundai Electronics America, infringed on its
patents. The U.S. company is asking the ITC to ban the
offending imports, which include several types of dynamic
random access memories, or DRAMs, and static random access
memories, or SRAMs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   SGS-Thomson, which is jointly owned by Thomson SA of
France and Istituto per la Recostruzione Industriale of
Italy, is the successor to Mostek Corp., which registered the
U.S. patents at the center of the controversy in the 1970s
and 1980s.
   The complaint is the first trade action taken by any U.S.
semiconductor producer against imports from South Korea. The
U.S. industry has been apprehensive there would be a surge of
computer-chip imports from South Korea, which recently has
increased its semiconductor production capacity.
   SGS-Thomson also has filed a lawsuit in federal district
court in Texas against Hyundai. In the suit, filed Feb. 27,
SGS-Thomson is seeking money damages and a permanent
injunction to halt alleged patent infringements.
   Separately, acting on another trade complaint, the ITC
decided to investigate charges by Ingersoll-Rand Co., a New
Jersey maker of power-tools, that its U.S. trademarks
covering "air-impact" wrenches have been infringed by
manufacturers in Taiwan and by Astro Pneumatic Tool Co., Los
Angeles, which distributes the Taiwan-made wrenches in the
U.S.

   SANTA ANA, Calif. -- EECO Inc. said it might seek
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors if Sanwa Bank of
California declares the high-technology electronics products
maker's $10 million credit agreement in default.
   The accord expired March 31.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   EECO's stock didn't open for trading yesterday on the
American Stock Exchange because of the news. Friday, the
shares closed at $1.75, unchanged.
   Late yesterday, EECO said it had recommended that the
exchange suspend trading in its stock until "its financial
condition is clarified." The company said it didn't know when
that might be.
   EECO said that if Sanwa calls the loan, the company could
have trouble getting other funding because of its poor
financial condition. The company then would have to consider
other options, it said, "including a restructuring under the
protection of Chapter 11" of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Robert Bonney, EECO chairman and chief executive officer,
said in an interview that Sanwa has held off declaring the
agreement in default while the company pursued the sale of
some or all of its businesses. But he added that Sanwa "could
call the loan at any time."
   Sanwa declined to comment.
   EECO has said it expects to report a $10.3 million net
loss for 1989. Posting of its financial results had been
delayed by a proposed sale of its Maxi-Switch computer
keyboard unit. In 1988, EECO had a loss of $13.2 million, on
sales of $13.9 million.
   The company also said that negotiations with a potential
purchaser of Maxi-Switch had broken off. Terms of the
proposed sale, EECO said, weren't satisfactory to Sanwa,
which holds liens on the unit's assets. The company said it
is in preliminary discussions with two new possible buyers of
the unit.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Digital Microwave Corp. stock plunged
almost 50% yesterday on news that fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings fell below estimates because of company errors in
manufacturing and selling a new product.
   The company wasn't more specific about the impact on
earnings, but it did say that it believes that earnings for
the quarter ended March 31 were "substantially lower" than
the 28 cents a share reported in fiscal 1989's fourth
quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Digital had net income of
$3.4 million on revenue of $20.4 million.

   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Digital shares were
battered, closing at $14.125, off $13.875 from Friday's close
of $28. Volume topped 2.4 million shares.
   The communications product manufacturer said it suffered a
host of problems related to the introduction of its
state-of-the-art microwave radio used by telephone concerns
and other communications companies. The company said the
price of the radio varies depending on its configuration but
that it typically sells for $30,000.
   William E. Gibson, Digital's president and chief executive
officer, said problems included accelerated costs when the
company moved from pilot manufacturing to mass manufacturing
of the radios. In addition, he said that the radio was
underpriced and added that the company is now studying how
much of an increase it should tack on to current prices.
   Prior to the company's announcement, Wall Street had
expected that Digital would earn between 40 cents and 44
cents a share for the fourth quarter. But yesterday, Steven
B. Levy, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist, told the Dow Jones
News Service that he expects Digital's earnings were only 16
cents to 17 cents a share.

   International Brief -- Mitsui &amp; Co.:
   Firm Revises Its Forecast
   For Revenue for Fiscal '90

   Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd. revised its revenue forecast for the
fiscal year ended March 31 to 20.1 trillion yen ($128.2
million), from 18.2 trillion yen forecast earlier.
   In fiscal 1989. the company had revenue of 14.828 trillion
yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A company spokesman cited dollar-denominated export and
import contracts for boosting revenue, as the Japanese yen
slid considerably against the U.S. currency.
   Favorable contracts on chemical plants, as well as on
electric machineries, also pushed revenue higher, he said.
   The spokesman also ascribed the upward revision partly to
gold trading reflecting the popularity of gold investment in
Japan.
   The company left its forecast for pretax profit and net
income unchanged, standing at 62 billion yen and 21 billion
yen, respectively, in part because of the slim profit margins
from gold transactions.
   In fiscal 1989, pretax profit was 54.89 billion yen, while
net income came to 16.61 billion yen.
