   Japan's Economy
   Is Termed Robust,
   But Braking Is Seen

   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of Japanese
business conditions shows a robust economy but analysts say
the rise in interest rates and the drop in the stock market
will eventually brake growth.
   Opinions are divided, however, about whether another
increase in the official discount rate will be needed before
that slowdown begins. The discount rate is the fee the
central bank charges on bank loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The survey, known as the tankan, was conducted in August
and took into account the rise in oil prices after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in early August. The survey's results were
released Tuesday.
   Despite the jump in oil prices and August's drop in the
stock market and rise in interest rates, "the more I look at
the {tankan} the more I'm impressed with how robust the
economy is," said Patricia Kuwayama, vice president of Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co. of New York's economics department.
   She said the outlook for most industries is the same or
even improved since the previous survey as consumers and
businesses continue to spend, fueling a domestic demand-led
expansion that is spread evenly across the whole economy and
regions of the country.
   Other economic data this week support the bullish outlook
of the survey. The Economic Planning Agency announced that
machinery orders in July were up 24% from a year earlier and
the Bank of Japan reported that the steady growth of personal
consumer spending is expected to continue through this fiscal
year, which ends March 31.
   However, analysts believe rising interest rates and the
slumping stock market will eventually slow the economy,
especially capital spending.
   "It will take some time for the effect of the higher
interest rates to appear" but the effect will show up, said
Kazuko Mizuno, economist at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.
   Since May 1989, the BOJ has raised its discount rate five
times from its historic low of 2.5%. It was last increased by
3/4 percentage point, to 6%, at the end of August.
   With the supply of products tight, the labor shortage
worsening and service costs rising, the timing of the rate
boost was just right, said Kunio Miyamoto, director and chief
economist of the Sumitomo Life Research Institute, an
affiliate of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.
   Whether another rate increase will be needed depends on
the situation in the Middle East and oil prices, he added.

   Businessman Sued
   Over Failed Loans
   At Dallas Thrift

   Houston businessman George Aubin, a borrower and principal
at several failed Texas thrifts, has been sued in connection
with $40 million in losses at the defunct Western Savings
Association of Dallas.
   The lawsuit, filed earlier this week in federal court in
Dallas, accuses Mr. Aubin of using $14.2 million in proceeds
from a Western loan to purchase a Kentucky horse farm. The
entire loan was supposed to finance the purchase of a tract
of land in North Dallas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit was filed by Sunbelt Savings FSB, which took over
Western's assets in August 1988, about two years after
Western's failure. The suit is one of at least three pending
against Mr. Aubin in connection with losses at Texas thrifts,
and he is among the targets of a federal criminal
investigation into the failures of two thrifts. Neither Mr.
Aubin nor his attorneys could be reached for comment.
   The suit filed this week is based on a $29 million loan
that Mr. Aubin and his partners obtained from Western in 1984
for the purported purchase of a tract of land in north
Dallas. The suit alleges that the loan amount was inflated by
a fraudulent land appraisal, enabling Mr. Aubin to siphon off
$14.2 million for the purchase of the horse farm. Sunbelt
claims that Western's losses grew to $40 million through
other, unpaid loans for development of the Dallas property.
   Mr. Aubin was forced to seek the funds from Western
Savings after former Texas Savings and Loan Commissioner L.
Linton Bowman III blocked Mr. Aubin from obtaining any more
loans from two Houston-based thrifts, Mercury Savings
Association and Ben Milam Savings Association, according to
the lawsuit. State and federal thrift laws limit the amount
of loans from one institution to one borrower.
   A separate lawsuit, brought by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., alleges that the officers and directors of
Mercury and Ben Milam contributed to the failures of the
thrifts. That suit also alleges that Mr. Aubin controlled the
thrifts and their lending activities although he didn't serve
as either an officer or director of the institutions. The
suit is pending in federal court in Houston.
   Another lawsuit being pursued by the FDIC in federal court
in Houston seeks to collect about $16 million in unpaid loans
from Mercury and Ben Milam to Mr. Aubin and his companies,
according to an attorney working for the FDIC.
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Houston is
conducting "an active investigation" of the failures of
Mercury and Ben Milam, according to the FBI agent in charge
of the probe. Mr. Aubin hasn't been charged with any criminal
activities in connection with the thrift failures.

   Scams in 900 Numbers Spur Calls for Federal Regulation

   Con artists have found a new hunting ground: telephone
services using 900, 976 and other numbers that bill the
caller.
   The most prevalent scams offer guaranteed credit cards or
credit repair, easy-to-get loans, and business or job
opportunities. In general, consumers call an advertised
number to hear a recorded message and are charged on their
monthly phone bill. In a spot check of 144 pay-per-call
services this spring, watchdog group Consumer Action found
that most of the messages were rip-offs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Consumers end up spending $30 to $40 for information they
could pull out of a phone book," says Stephen Texeira, a
researcher for the San Francisco consumer group. "A
`government jobs hot line' gave out numbers for agencies in
California -- for $20."
   The rapid growth of the services has led to crackdowns by
regulators on the federal and local level. Late last month,
the Postal Service and the U.S. attorney's office in Des
Moines, Iowa, won a preliminary injunction against two
promoters who enticed more than 80,000 people to dial a 900
number at $9.90 a call. The duo were accused of mailing 1.5
million postcards that included the 900 number and told
recipients they had won a Mercedes-Benz, a Hawaiian vacation
or a mink coat.
   Postal attorney Geoff Drucker says callers later were
mailed a solicitation for such magazines as Atlantic and
Time, and a request to send a $150 "refundable deposit" to a
post office box to secure hotel rooms for three nights. But
the promised "vacation extravaganza" included no airfare, no
meals and no other expenses.
   Lawyers for the two men contend the mailing was a
legitimate solicitation for magazine subscriptions, and that
callers could have mailed back a postcard instead of making
the $9.90 call -- an option used by more than 100,000 people
on the mailing list. A hearing in the case is scheduled for
next Tuesday.
   Earlier this summer, New York Attorney General Robert
Abrams put an end to a service that gave purported tips on
how to win the state lottery -- at an average $2.25 a call.
And in Atlanta, a federal court, acting on the Federal Trade
Commission's first complaint involving 900 numbers, shut down
a bogus employment line about a month ago. When callers
dialed a toll-free number that advertised high-paying jobs,
they were instructed to dial a 976 or 900 number. They
weren't told, however, that they would be socked $15 to $18
for the second call.
   The stepped-up enforcement has sparked a debate over
whether tougher federal regulation is needed and whether
phone companies should monitor all 900 messages and refuse to
bill consumers for questionable programs. Although
information-service providers and phone companies generally
reject regulation as the answer, many worry that the
continued spread of rip-offs and sleazy programs could choke
the fledgling 900 industry. The bad reputation of the
industry is making some local phone companies reluctant about
handling the billing of the services.
   "This is a growing problem," says Mr. Abrams, who figures
his office has more than 100 telephone scam investigations
and related inquiries open. New York regulators "took
protective steps, but now we're finding that a lot of
suspicious telemarketing is shifting to the federal level,
900 numbers," and away from intrastate numbers such as 540
and 976 lines.
   Mr. Abrams and other attorneys general around the country
are joining the chorus of consumer groups urging the Federal
Communications Commission to adopt consumer safeguards. They
also have asked long-distance carriers to police themselves.
Among other things, they would like full disclosure of costs
in any advertising for caller-paid phone numbers, and a
chance for callers to hang up without being charged for calls
that cost more than a couple of dollars. In New York, for
instance, callers must get a clear, brief explanation of
charges at the start of a call and time to hang up before the
meter starts running on any call that costs $3.50 or more.
   Barry Cutler, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, agrees that consumers need more safeguards. "This
dandelion approach -- going after the roots one at a time --
is not going to be a successful strategy for the 900
industry," he says. The FTC issued a consumer alert in July,
and Mr. Cutler now suggests an intensive "weed-control"
program involving phone companies, the FCC, information
providers and others.
   The FCC is reviewing the matter, but isn't inclined to
push for new rules -- especially if industry self-policing,
backed up by the FTC and law enforcement agencies, can
control the problem.
   Rep. Bart Gordon (D., Tenn.) has been leading a push for
greater federal regulation of 900 service. The House
Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee is taking a first
step with a hearing on 900 rip-offs tentatively scheduled for
next Wednesday. The possibility of legislation, however, is
still remote.
   The four long-distance carriers that provide 900 service
are split over how much to monitor programs that run on their
networks. But they all acknowledge that, even with aggressive
monitoring, problems can slip through. Some enterprising
programs have figured out how to circumvent phone company
prohibitions on obscene material. "There are a whole bunch of
information lines that run Monday through Friday, but on
Friday nights turn into sex lines," says one 900 industry
executive.
   "That's certainly not unheard of," confirms Andrea West,
who heads marketing for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
900 service.
   Among the four carriers, only MCI Communications Corp.
doesn't screen messages before allowing them to run on its
network nor does it monitor messages afterwards. MCI cites
First Amendment concerns. The company says it keeps tabs only
on the level of complaints it receives. MCI's trigger
mechanism isn't particularly sensitive: Both the jobs line
that the FTC attacked and the sweepstakes line the Postal
Service went after were carried -- and billed -- by MCI.
   Gene Eidenberg, an executive vice president, acknowledges
the approach has been too narrow. MCI, he says, is planning
to begin a push for industrywide 900 standards modeled after
California regulation. Along with requiring information
providers to disclose the price and giving callers time to
hang up, MCI is advocating that information providers certify
that their programs are lawful and comply with local phone
companies' billing and collection restrictions. Mr. Eidenberg
says there's a need for a system to track consumer complaints
as well as a separate prefix for "adult" programs and
restrictions on programming aimed at children.
   AT&amp;T, US Sprint Communications Corp., a unit of United
Telecommunications Inc., and Telesphere Communications Inc.
all say they monitor 900 messages and have kicked certain
programs off their networks. AT&amp;T, for instance, cites a
"Call Santa" program it halted in Seattle nearly two years
ago. Television ads instructed children too young to dial
themselves to hold the receiver to the TV set, which emitted
tones to call service.
   The information-services industry itself is working to
avert both state and federal regulation by devising standards
for program providers to police themselves. Restrictions on
advertising that encourages children to dial caller-paid
programs, requirements for clear price disclosures, and seals
of approval are among the measures being considered at both
the Information Industry Association and the National
Association for Information Services. The latter group was
organized earlier this year, mainly in reaction to the 900
industry's sordid reputation and the growing threat of state
and federal regulation.
   The telephone information industry has been pressing to
expand beyond dial-a-porn and "infotainment" and into the
mainstream of American business, offering companies a
profitable alternative to 800 service. But the reputation of
900 and 976 lines as well as the reluctance of local phone
companies to bill consumers for products sold over the phone
are proving to be barriers.
   "The scams and sex lines have certainly given the industry
a bad start," says Glenn Lebowitz, president of Optima Direct
Inc., a Washington direct-marketing and campaign-management
concern that has been a pioneer in 900 programs. "But 900 is
too attractive a vehicle for the big guys to stay out."
   Nevertheless, increased consumer complaints could
encourage the local phone companies to pull the plug if
long-distance carriers don't impose tougher regulation.
"Right now, the industry is living on the edge," Mr. Lebowitz
says. "If 900 causes enough aggravation, local phone
companies might decide they don't want to be part of it."

   Michigan Researchers Are Developing
   Method to Place Genes in Body Tissues

   A technique for inserting new genes into specific tissues
in the body is being developed at the University of Michigan
in Ann Arbor.
   In experiments on pigs, researchers there inserted a new
gene into cells of a small, limited section of an artery. The
genetically altered cells then began producing a new protein,
the product of the new gene, the Michigan scientists reported
in this week's issue of the journal Science.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The technique holds promise of a new way to treat diseases
such as heart disease and cancer as well as genetic diseases,
said Elizabeth Nabel, Gregory Plautz and Gary Nabel, of the
internal medicine department at the Michigan medical school.
Gary Nabel, who is Elizabeth Nabel's husband, also is with
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute on the Michigan campus.
   A potential beneficiary of the new technique might, for
example, be a heart patient whose clogged coronary arteries
have just been reopened by surgery or other techniques. With
the new technique, a gene that produced a clot-preventing
protein could be introduced into the wall of the newly
reopened section of the artery, thereby preventing a clot
from forming and plugging the artery a second time.
Alternatively, a gene might be inserted that prevented
arterial cells from proliferating into a new, artery-clogging
deposit, the scientists suggested.
   Another possibility, the researchers said, would be to
take a gene that produced a protein that activates the immune
system and insert it into the walls of blood vessels that
supplied a malignant tumor. This way, the immune system might
be triggered to launch a powerful but localized attack on the
tumor.
   The experimental Michigan technique differs from
techniques planned for human gene therapy experiments that
were approved by federal regulators at the end of July. In
the latter experiments, scientists will inject volunteer
patients with blood cells that have been genetically altered
in the test tube. The gene-altered blood cells, it's hoped,
will produce proteins that will cure a devastating genetic
defect in one experiment and a lethal skin cancer in another
experiment.
   In contrast, the Michigan scientists hope to insert new
genes directly into tissues in the body, rather than in
test-tube grown cells, and to confine the genetic alteration
to specific organs or anatomical sites rather than
circulating gene-altered blood cells throughout the body.
   In their pig experiments, the Michigan scientists said
they took a mouse virus long used in medical research and
gave it a new gene that produces a protein called
beta-galactosidase. The protein turns blue when exposed to a
certain chemical, enabling researchers to tell which tissues
were producing the protein and which weren't.
   A thin catheter with two balloons along its tip was
inserted into a thigh artery of each of 10 pigs. The two
balloons, separated by less than an inch of space, were
inflated, blocking the artery fore and aft. The genetically
altered virus was injected into the space between the two
balloons and allowed to infect the nearby walls of the
artery.
   Subsequent tests with the blue-staining chemical showed
that the cells of the artery walls from infected pigs were
producing the beta-galactosidase protein and were still doing
so as long as 21 weeks later. Equally important from a safety
viewpoint, tests of other tissues such as the lungs, liver
and kidneys for the protein were negative, indicating that
the genetic alteration was confined to the short section of
the thigh artery.
   The experiments show that the technique allows "the
introduction of recombinant genes into any site accessible to
a catheter," the researchers said. The technique doesn't
require several weeks of advanced preparation of cells in the
test tube and thus it should help make gene therapy easier
and more widely applicable, the scientists said.

   Despite Bush Pledge, U.S. Firms
   Face Hurdles to Soviet Trade

   MOSCOW -- Despite President Bush's pledge in Helsinki that
the U.S. will be "as forthcoming as possible" in helping the
Soviet economy, an American business delegation he sent here
found that closer economic ties still face numerous
obstacles.
   The group of 15 chief executive officers, led by Commerce
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, announced several new ventures
with Soviet organizations and agreed to take part in a U.S.
government-managed program to train Soviet executives.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But significant expansion of business still awaits Soviet
passage of an emigration law and settlement of pre-Communist
Russian debts to the U.S., among other things. Even the
U.S.-Soviet trade agreement, announced with fanfare at the
June summit in Washington, remains in limbo.
   "We can't implement the trade agreement until they pass
that emigration law," says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary
of Commerce for International Trade. The law has been on the
Soviet parliament's agenda for months, but legislators
haven't approved it. Mr. Mosbacher said he was told by Soviet
officials that it could be passed within four to eight weeks.
   The collapsing Soviet economy is also proving a tough
challenge for would-be Western business partners. The nation
is on the verge of adopting sweeping market-oriented reforms
that aim to decentralize and deregulate much of the economy.
But there is considerable uncertainty over what this would
involve, and what impact it would have on the existing
structure of Soviet trade.
   "It's clear that this isn't the easiest time to be
negotiating joint ventures with the Soviet Union," says
Kenneth T. Derr, chairman and chief executive of Chevron
Corp., which is discussing a big oil project in the republic
of Kazakhstan. Mr. Derr and other executives say they are
hedging their bets by keeping close contacts with Soviet
officials at all levels.
   "Things are fluid, because you don't know which unit of
government will be making the rules," says Lodwrick Cook,
chairman of Atlantic Richfield Corp. "Right now, if you sign
a deal with the national government, you might also have to
sign with the republic or local governments as well."
   Until the reforms are in place, Western executives will
also have to put up with traditional problems of the Soviet
economy, such as the absence of a convertible currency, poor
transport and telecommunications, ambiguous laws and obscure
accounting practices. At the same time, the present system is
showing rapid decline; the daily Izvestia reported yesterday
that industrial production dropped 1.7% in August alone,
continuing a slide that started last year.
   Mr. Mosbacher says many of these problems are "not
insurmountable, but there are differences that we need to
work together to overcome." And, in public at least, the
executives appear cheered by the trip, which Dwayne O.
Andreas, chairman and chief executive of
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., described as "a watershed."
   Although common practice in many other nations, it is rare
for the U.S. to send a senior government official abroad at
the head of a delegation of businessmen, and the executives
welcomed the change. "In the past we were badly beaten by
Europeans who had support of their governments when we
didn't," says John J. Murphy, chief executive of Dresser
Industries Inc.
   The new ventures announced include agreements between
Sea-Land Services Inc, a unit of CSX Corp., and the Black Sea
and Baltic shipping companies to carry cargo on their
vessels. Alex J. Mandl, Sea-Land's chairman and chief
executive, says the company will also send staff to oversee a
new Trans-Siberian Express rail service that the company
plans to use to transport goods from Asia to Europe.
   Mr. Andreas of Archer-Daniels-Midland says he reached
final understanding with Soviet officials for ventures
involving soy protein and grain storage facilities, but gave
no details. And an existing joint venture involving Transisco
Industries Inc. landed orders for equipping 1,000 railway
cars to export oil and chemicals, says Transisco's chief,
Mark C. Hungerford.
   Such agreements have been in the pipeline for some time,
however, and aren't related to Mr. Bush's pledge in Helsinki
for greater U.S. private-sector involvement in the Soviet
economy. "All the deals now being cut are being done on an
essentially stand-alone basis," says Mr. Farren of the
Commerce Department. "You come in and do your own special
deals with the ministries." He said a U.S. goal is to get the
Soviets to set up a "generic structure" for normal business
agreements.
   Moreover, in the one area where the Soviets are most
hopeful of receiving U.S. technology and expertise, oil and
gas, the American delegation appeared to make little headway,
even though six of the 15 chief executives came from these
industries. Mr. Cook of Atlantic Richfield says he returns
home "better informed and enthusiastic," but admits there are
"political and economic issues still to be resolved."
   Chevron, which in early 1989 signed a protocol of intent
to work in the Kazakhstan oil fields, now hopes to reach
final agreement by year end and possibly start production in
1991, Mr. Derr says. While that venture could turn out to be
the biggest investment of any U.S. company in the Soviet
Union, most of the other deals, planned and agreed, are more
modest.
   Mr. Mandl said Sea-Land is interested in using Soviet rail
and air facilities for moving freight from East to West. But
he says the company's planned ventures involve investment of
just "a few million dollars." Given the current political and
economic climate in the Soviet Union, "if I had to spend $1
billion, I'd think differently about it," he said.

   Chemical Linked
   To Huntington's
   Disease Is Found
   ----

   BOSTON -- Researchers here identified a brain-chemical
abnormality associated with Huntington's disease, providing a
clue to the inherited disorder's cause and suggesting new
treatment possibilities.
   The finding follows an earlier discovery of the
approximate location of the gene that causes the disease, an
invariably fatal mental and motor deterioration that
typically isn't apparent until midlife. The earlier work made
possible diagnostic tests that can reveal whether a person
has the gene, which makes eventual onset of the disease
almost certain. But there are no preventatives for the
estimated 125,000 Americans carrying the gene, nor effective
treatments for the 25,000 people who already have developed
the disease, which killed folk singer Woody Guthrie.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Recently, however, scientists have begun to unravel the
brain-chemistry disruption caused by the defective gene,
raising hopes for palliatives. Previous studies have
suggested that the disease causes excessive activation of
so-called NMDA receptors, certain molecules involved in
transmitting chemical messages between brain cells. How the
disease causes the overactivation has been unclear, though.
   The latest study, led by neurologist Flint Beal at
Massachusetts General Hospital, sheds light on that question.
Using a sensitive chemical analyzer, the researchers spotted
an abnormality in the levels of certain substances in the
brains of people who had died from Huntington's disease. In
particular, the finding indicates that the disease lowers
levels of kynurenic acid, which is thought to protect against
overactivation of NMDA receptors.
   The discovery opens the door to "more possibilities for
developing therapies" for the disease, said Robert McBurney,
vice president, research, at Cambridge NeuroScience Research,
Cambridge, Mass. His company and several other concerns are
developing experimental drugs to block overactivation of NMDA
receptors that accompanies strokes and certain other
disorders. Current drug candidates, however, may have side
effects that rule out their use over long periods to mitigate
Huntington's disease.
   The Boston study, published in the current issue of the
Journal of Neurochemistry, may lead to better candidates --
perhaps drugs to raise levels of kynurenic acid. It also
should help scientists more accurately replicate the disease
process in animals, said Dr. Beal, which would speed up
treatment research. Moreover, researchers at ESA Corp.,
Bedford, Mass., which makes the chemical analyzer used in the
study, hope to develop a simple and cheap diagnostic test for
the disease based on the distinctive pattern of neurochemical
abnormalities it causes.

   Air Bags Make Headway
   In Auto Rental Fleets

<TEXT>
   CAR RENTERS have something new to think about when they
pick a company: air bags.
   Like auto makers, several rental car companies are rushing
to make the safety feature a much bigger part of their
fleets. Dollar Rent A Car Systems says about half of its cars
will have them in the 1991 season, which begins next month;
that's more than triple its current proportion. Hertz and
National Car Rental System also will have about half of their
fleets equipped with air bags, while Thrifty Car Rental says
80% of its cars will have them, up from 50% this season.
   Thrifty isn't shy about promoting the feature. In one new
TV ad about the air bags, a woman drives nervously in a
rainstorm while a narrator intones: "At Thrifty, we care as
much about safety as we do savings."
   Maybe so, but industry observers say a rental company's
interest in air bags is driven mainly by who owns it.
Chrysler recently bought both Dollar and Thrifty, and almost
all Chrysler cars have air bags. Ownership doesn't determine
which auto maker a rental company will buy from, but
certainly influences it.
   "It's not like the companies are going out and putting air
bags in their cars," says Dan Rubin, editor of Auto Rental
News. "The fleets they have happen to have them."
   By the same token, Avis is 25%-owned by General Motors,
whose lines don't have a lot of air bags. Avis says it will
have air bags in only a quarter of its 1991 fleet.
   Most rental companies won't be able to guarantee that any
one customer will get a car with an air bag. Still, many
observers think the availability of air bags will heavily
affect consumer choice. "For a lot of people, one car rental
company is the same as another," says Harold Seligman,
president of Management Alternatives, a corporate travel
consultant in Stamford, Conn. "This differentiates them."
                                                                                                       

   Phoning From Runway
   May Get Easier for Fliers
                                                                                                       

   TRAVELERS who carry their own cellular telephones may
finally get a chance to use them when their plane is stuck on
the ground.
   Currently, the Federal Communications Commission prohibits
these phones from being used in airplanes, whether on the
ground or in the air. So, the only way to make a call is to
use airline on-board phones, at a cost of $2 a minute. That's
profitable for the airlines, but it has long angered cellular
phone users.
   The FCC says the phones can't be used in the air because
they interfere with calls by earthbound cellular phone users.
"We banned them on the ground because we figured people
wouldn't hang up when their flight took off," says Steve
Markendorff, the FCC's chief of the cellular radio branch.
   But the agency is reconsidering its position for ground
use. Airlines say the phones can interfere with a pilot's
communication system even on the ground. But cellular phone
companies say the airlines haven't proved this. And so far,
the Federal Aviation Administration says cellular phones
don't seem to pose a risk when they're used on the ground.
"They're not a concern for us," says an FAA spokesman.
                                                                                                       

   Airline Security Often
   Isn't a Full-Time Job
                                                                                                       

   AIRLINES TALK a lot about having tough security. But USAir
has a full-time security staff of just 13 employees. Delta
Air Lines has eight. And United Airlines, the nation's
largest carrier, has four.
   Of course, airlines contract with hundreds of people to
handle security-related matters, such as X-raying baggage at
airports. They also train many employees on security matters.
But many security specialists say the airlines' staffs are
deplorably low, since they're supposed to help carriers deal
with hijackings, drug smuggling and terrorist acts.
   "When you realize how few people they really have, it's
sort of scary," says Denis Day of the Day Partnership, a
travel consultant in Oak Brook, Ill.
   Because the staffs are so small, security specialists say,
airlines don't have the contacts they need with local airport
police. In case of real emergencies, many carriers may have
only regular employees working with law enforcement
officials. "If there's a bomb threat," says Steve Gardella, a
security consultant in San Diego, "do you want some
professional helping to handle that, or some guy who's taken
a few security courses?"
   Airlines say their staffs are adequate and that few
incidents have occurred in recent years. "To some degree, we
have to rely on the local and federal police agencies," says
Jim Goodwin, senior vice president of services planning for
United. He notes that the carrier recently doubled its staff
-- to four from two.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   SINCE THE Persian Gulf crisis erupted last month, American
Express says sales of traveler's checks in the region are
growing three times faster than usual. Apparently, residents
and travelers there are worried about having their cash and
other assets taken in a war or political takeover. . . . When
it comes to on-time performance, the smaller the better.
Since the government began keeping records three years ago,
tiny America West Airlines and Southwest Airlines have had
the best and second-best overall records, respectively.
Larger competitors claim these carriers do well because their
hubs are in goodweather spots. But that doesn't seem to apply
to Alaska Airlines, a small carrier that flies to a lot of
foggy, snowy cities and has ranked fourth since 1987.

   Dutch Retailer Ahold Looks to the U.S.
   For Continuing Its Expansion Program

   ZAANDAM, the Netherlands -- Dutch food retailer Ahold N.V.
said it would like to target an acquisition in the U.S. as
part of its continuing expansion plans.
   After strong 1989 net income growth of 33.6% to 194.6
million Dutch guilders ($108.5 million) on sales of 17.6
billion guilders, followed by 39% growth for the first half
of 1990, Ahold has the means to accomplish a large
acquisition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To maintain its strategy of balanced growth between the
U.S. and Western Europe after two recent expansion moves in
the U.S., Ahold would prefer to acquire a large European
grocer that occupies one of the top slots in its market.
   Unfortunately, there aren't any suitable candidates on the
market, according to Pierre Everaert, Ahold's president.
   "Why does it have to be a large corporation? Because, if
you talk about Germany, unless you have between {$1.88
billion and $3.14 billion in revenue}, you are just not a
player. . . . The same applies elsewhere. You can be either
first, second or third, but you have to have a certain
critical mass to be able to command the discounts and to
compete in the market," Mr. Everaert said.
   However, opportunities do exist in the U.S., he said. "In
the U.S. we have 356 stores out of 36,000 supermarkets, so
the possibilities are obviously much greater {than in
Europe}."
   With the dollar scraping post-war lows against the
guilder, U.S. businesses appear relatively inexpensive. In
addition, a number of U.S. grocers may be ripe for plucking,
the company asserted.
   "In the last 15 months or the last two years . . . 64
{U.S.} corporations have either done their capital
restructuring, or a leveraged buy-out, or a management
buyout," Mr. Everaert said. With recession in certain areas,
increased costs, and the difficulty of refinancing, "we feel
that several of these companies would either be for sale or
would be looking for a financial partner who would bring in
equity."
   While there may be a wide range of potential targets to
choose from, Mr. Everaert said Ahold would seek to reinforce
its existing position in the U.S., where it operates the
Bi-Lo, Giant Food Stores and First National Supermarket
chains. The three chains mark off a triangular area of the
U.S. roughly bound by Atlanta, Cleveland and Boston.
   In the past, Ahold has expanded its U.S. operations both
by acquiring entire supermarket chains -- as in its 1988
purchase of First National Supermarket -- or through the
purchase of clusters of stores. In 1989, Ahold purchased 21
Kroger stores in North and South Carolina.
   Specifically, Ahold wants to strengthen its grip on the
Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C., areas, as well as its
positions in Connecticut and Long Island, N.Y.
   "There are quite a few cities where we are rather strong,
but there are a lot of areas where we aren't No. 1 or No. 2,"
Mr. Everaert said. He said the company would prefer buying
either a cluster of stores or buying a company with $1
billion to $1.5 billion in revenue.
   Analysts gave a favorable reaction to Ahold's acquisition
plans.
   "In the U.S., there are a number of companies that are in
difficulties and, with the dollar so low, they could probably
pick one up that is a pretty good bargain," said Fiona
Marshall, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson Group in London.
"The only negative is that a U.S. acquisition increases their
dollar exposure." However, even considering the larger
exposure to the dollar, she said, "I am really quite positive
on Ahold."
   As an alternative, Ahold may target an expansion effort in
Western Europe toward smaller businesses with annual revenue
of between $200 million and $300 million.
   Ahold said it could buy into an existing company, helping
them to develop faster than they would by themselves. Mr.
Everaert said he is looking for partnerships that could later
develop into 100%-owned subsidiaries. He cited Scandinavia or
Spain as possible areas for expansion.
   Toward this end, Ahold is considering deepening its
partnerships with members of the Associated Marketing
Services, an alliance of Western European grocers that
includes Ahold.
   Through the European Retail Alliance, Ahold already has
mutual holdings with the Argyll Group of the U.K. and Groupe
Casino of France -- neither of which are considered possible
targets by Ahold.
   Mr. Everaert ruled out further expansion efforts in
Eastern Europe other than its alliance with the
Czechoslovakian retailer Bramen Ostrava. Although Ahold
signed a letter of intent in June to work with Bramen
Ostrava, the Dutch grocer is already finding their work cut
out for them.
   "They are starting from zero. They are discovering free
enterprise, and there is a tremendous need for coaching, for
training. So we have decided instead of doing a little bit in
many countries we will do one big bit in one country," he
said.

   MURRAY HILL, N.J. -- C.R. Bard Inc. said it agreed to sell
its Shield Healthcare Centers subsidiaries to a U.S.
subsidiary of Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co., a privately held
maker of household and medical products based in Osaka,
Japan.
   Shield Healthcare, which has centers primarily in the Los
Angeles area, sells medical supplies and equipment for home
patient care. Bard, a health care products concern, said it

   They're Mad Now, but Just Wait

   SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. -- Elsewhere, palm trees
conjure up images of long, sandy beaches and fun in the sun.
   Not here. The appearance of some new palm trees has
angered residents, made local headlines and become part of a
heated battle in the town's city council.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The hoopla started in February when Robert Maurer, a
real-estate developer, planted 87 very tall palm trees along
a mountain ridge. Mr. Maurer has been involved in a legal
battle with the city over his efforts to build a house on the
ridge, so many residents interpreted the palm trees as an act
of revenge.
   "A lot of people are calling it porcupine hill," says
Jeanne Lyon, a travel agent at Uniglobe San Juan Travel.
"People didn't find it appealing. We just like our community
to be as attractive as possible." She also says the trees
look bad because they have unusually short fronds. "They look
like so many stakes stuck along the hill."
   The Orange County Register described the scene as "fancy
toothpicks stabbed into a mound of meat loaf." Residents have
written protest letters to the Daily SunPost in San Clemente
and complained to city officials.
   City officials are a bit guarded on the politically
sensitive issue. "It's a tough thing to deal with. We're in
litigation," says Stephen Julian, the city manager. But he
adds: "Most people are outraged. Most people feel he did it
to spite the city and to embarrass people."
   Mr. Maurer's son, Mark, flatly denies a revenge motive. He
says the family bought the trees at bargain prices because
they were about to be bulldozed and they were planted to line
the intended driveway. "It has nothing to do with animosity
between certain city officials -- and I emphasize certain --
and my father," he says. "My dad likes palm trees."
   The younger Mr. Maurer also says the palm fronds had to be
pruned considerably to travel, giving them the appearance of
fancy toothpicks. "We have taken a lot of abuse over
something that is a temporary situation," says Mr. Maurer.
"The fronds will open up as they grow. It distresses me that
no one can see into the future and see that the trees won't
always look like telephone poles."
   Mr. Maurer also reasons that the 87 trees, even at bargain
prices, simply cost too much to have been planted for
revenge: "If you wanted to insult someone, there would be
cheaper ways to do it."

   LOS ANGELES -- A federal grand jury indicted former Family
Savings &amp; Loan Association Chairman Oliver A. Trigg, charging
him with defrauding the thrift in a complex scheme to take
control of Family using Family's own money.
   Mr. Trigg was charged with conspiracy, bank fraud, money
laundering, false statements and tax fraud. If convicted, he
faces a maximum of 94 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
Three others in the case face lesser charges.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the indictment, Mr. Trigg, while he was
serving as chairman of the board but held no equity in the
thrift, arranged for Family to loan $2.5 million to a third
party to develop a real estate property. Then $1.24 million
of the money allegedly was laundered into Mr. Trigg's
personal bank account and used to buy 51% of Family. He also
allegedly lied about the transaction to federal regulators.
   "The transactions involved in this case are prime examples
of the kind of fraud and self-dealing that appears in so many
of the troubled S&amp;Ls around the country," said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Maurice A. Leiter, who is prosecuting the case.
   Mr. Trigg attracted local media attention in August 1987
when he acquired control of the thrift, partly because with
assets of more than $140 million, Family was one of the
largest black-owned savings and loans in the nation.
   But two months later, the Los Angeles Times published an
article which triggered an examination by regulators, who
called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation in early 1988.
Mr. Trigg resigned from Family a few months later.
   Family is still in operation after Washington, D.C.-based
OFC Inc. acquired control in January. President Wayne-Kent
Bradshaw said the thrift expected to post a small operating
profit this year and was in compliance with all federal
regulations.
   Mr. Trigg's attorney Arthur Barens said of the indictment,
"We don't believe that Mr. Trigg did anything inappropriate
or engaged in any conduct that resulted in any loss for
Family Savings &amp; Loan."

   MELVILLE, N.J. -- Chyron Corp., unable to secure new
financing, said it intends to file for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The maker of electronic graphics and videotape and film
editing equipment said it is taking the action because it
can't repay $10 million in loans called yesterday by
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. The bank agreed to provide $9
million to Chyron as debtor-in-possession, however.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chyron hadn't made any loan payments since June 30 and was
seeking to restructure loans and obtain additional financing
from its banks.
   But Manufacturers Hanover and Chyron's other major lender,
European American Bank, couldn't come to terms on sharing
loan collateral. Chyron owes $20 million to European
American.
   The dispute stemmed from Chyron granting both banks in
1989 a security interest in its accounts receivable as a
condition for the company to pay a quarterly dividend.
European America said that it had first lien on the company's
receivables and that Manufacturers Hanover had the second
lien.
   As result, Chyron said, Manufacturers Hanover filed suit
last week against European American, charging the bank with
fraud and breach of contract. Chyron also was named as a
defendant in the suit, but no relief is being sought against
Chyron, the company said.
   Chyron had a net loss of $1.9 million on revenue of $44.1
million in 1989.

   Medicare Funds
   Improperly Paid

   WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services
said it will contact more than one million employers in a
program to collect as much as $600 million in Medicare
payments that were improperly paid to people covered by
private health insurance.
   Congress authorized the effort last year after this
newspaper disclosed that Medicare had paid billions of
dollars in health-insurance claims that should have been paid
by private insurance companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The money was paid to working people over 65 and people
over 65 who were covered by a working spouse's employer group
health plan. In such cases, bills are supposed to be
submitted to private insurance companies first, with Medicare
picking up any qualified uncovered charges. Instead, the HHS
inspector general found that many of these claims went
directly to Medicare because corporations and their insurers
didn't funnel them to private companies first.
   Congress authorized the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare, to work with the Social
Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service to
set up an extensive computer matching program to trace the
employment of Medicare beneficiaries.
   In addition, the HCFA has hired Group Health Inc. of New
York to contact more than one million employers to determine
if Medicare beneficiaries and their spouses were covered by
private plans that should have paid their bills. This effort
will start by the end of the year. Under the law passed last
year, companies will face a $1,000 fine for each such request
for information they fail to answer within 30 days.
   "The 1989 legislation provides us with important new tools
to identify cases in which Medicare can recover payments that
should have been made by other parties," said HCFA Director
Gail Wilensky.
   In addition to the collection program, which could bring
in as much as $600 million, the Justice Department has filed
suits against several major insurance companies to recover
funds. It is also in the process of launching a program to
alert both employers and insurers to the risks they face by
circumventing the Medicare payment rules.

   NEW YORK -- Playboy Enterprises Inc. is considering
acquiring or investing in Spy, a four-year-old humor
magazine.
   Playboy executives characterized the talks as informal,
but a spokeswoman said there was "real interest" on the part
of Chicago-based Playboy Enterprises, publisher of Playboy
magazine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Spy has been seeking an investor, or acquirer, for most of
this year -- without success. Last February, Spy's publisher
Thomas L. Phillips Jr. said he and his partners had retained
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to consider offers from interested
buyers and investors. Mr. Phillips said Spy worked with
Morgan Stanley for about three months, but dropped the
investment banking company after passing on several potential
investors Morgan Stanley proposed.
   However, industry executives said that Morgan Stanley had
overestimated the value investors would put on Spy and that
Spy's owners had, in turn, held out for too high a price.
Morgan Stanley executives did not return calls seeking
comment.
   A Playboy company spokeswoman confirmed recent talks were
held between Mr. Phillips and Michael Perlis, president and
publisher of Playboy. Mr. Perlis wasn't available for
comment. "Spy would be a nice complement to Playboy," said a
Playboy spokeswoman.
   After launching in 1986, Spy gained attention for its
satires on the rich and famous. The magazine's notoriety
reached far beyond its circulation, which Mr. Phillips said
is about 150,000. Spy expanded into book publishing with the
same brand of humor as its magazine, and this year produced
its first TV show for the NBC network.
   In recent months, Spy's advertising volume has fallen,
compared with 1989 levels. Mr. Phillips said that while
advertising is down, the magazine has raised its ad rates and
thus was getting more revenue per page. "People figured we
were in trouble last spring because we were for sale," Mr.
Phillips said. "We weren't and we aren't. We are still a
profitable magazine."

   MONTREAL -- Canadian Pacific Ltd. said it may buy back as
many as 9.9% of its shares outstanding, which have fallen
steeply in price this year.
   The holding company with interests in transportation,
telecommunications, hotels, energy and natural resources
filed for regulatory clearance to purchase as many as 31.5
million shares on Canadian stock exchanges in a 12-month
period that will begin Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Canadian companies often make such filings on a
contingency basis and renew them each year without actually
buying many shares. But a spokesman for Canadian Pacific said
its filing wasn't a renewal and represented a belief that the
shares are attractively priced.
   Canadian Pacific closed yesterday at $15.75 a share, up
12.5 cents, on New York Stock Exchange composite volume of
1.6 million shares.
   The company's shares have fallen about 35% on the Toronto
Stock Exchange since last October, while the exchange's
bellwether index of 300 stocks has fallen only about 11%. Its
profit has followed a similar course. First-half net income
was down 34% to 177.8 million Canadian dollars (US$152.9
million) from C$270.4 million a year earlier, mostly because
of a drop in earnings at its 80%-owned Canadian Pacific
Forest Products Ltd.
   Analyst Michael Graham of Midland Walwyn Capital Inc. said
a stock buy-back would be a sound move. Canadian Pacific's
shares had a book value of C$24.46 each at the end of last
year, and Mr. Graham estimates their real net asset value at
C$40 to C$50 because of undervalued real estate assets. The
forest-products subsidiary's problems result from a slump in
demand affecting companies all across the industry.

   Plight of World's Poorest Nations
   Will Worsen in 1990s, U.N. Says

   PARIS -- During the booming 1980s the richest countries
got richer while the poorest countries got poorer. During the
uncertain 1990s the richest countries may not get much
richer, but the poorest countries will almost certainly get
poorer.
   That's the general conclusion emerging from a 11-day
United Nations conference, ending today, on the special
problems of the world's 41 poorest nations, home to 420
million people. The conference will issue a report calling
for rich countries to give the poor more aid, and for poor
countries to spend that aid more wisely. A similar conference
here in 1981 issued a similar report, called the Substantial
New Program of Action. It was largely ignored, and things got
worse.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We represent despair," says A.H.G. Mohiuddin,
Bangladesh's ambassador to the U.N. "Our situation has only
deteriorated."
   That deterioration is likely to continue. The United
Nations estimates that oil price rises connected with the
Persian Gulf crisis could add more than $1 billion to the oil
bill of the poorest countries this year and next. The U.N.
had figured that these countries, already saddled with $70
billion in foreign debt, would need extra aid inflows of $11
billion by 1995 to get them started on the path to recovery.
The U.N. says an oil price of $25 a barrel increases that
figure to more than $14 billion. For the poorest countries to
reach a decent growth rate of 5% a year, they would need aid
from the rich totaling $36 billion a year, triple what they
received last year.
   The poor countries claim, with some justification, that
the rich countries haven't kept their promises. The 1981
program called for generous debt rescheduling or forgiveness,
only some of which has happened, and called for rich
countries to devote 0.15% of their gross national product to
help the poorest countries. While some European countries
have done so, the U.S. and Japan have fallen well short, and
the total reached only 0.09%, right where it was in 1981. The
U.N. says that if everyone had met the 0.15% target, the poor
countries would have been $40 billion better off between 1982
and 1988.
   The poor were also hit hard by two big oil price increases
and the collapse in price of most basic commodities, often
their only source of export income. During recessions, rich
countries tended to make it hard for poor countries to sell
their products: The poorest countries' share of world trade
in manufactured goods dropped to 0.3% from 1.3% during the
1980s.
   The rich countries claim, also with some justification,
that aid to poor countries is often wasted by non-democratic
governments. Leading industrial countries wanted strong
pledges from the poor countries that they would move more
quickly toward democracy. "What we've learned over the past
decade," says Stephane Hessel, a former French ambassador who
helped organize the 1981 conference, "is that democracy is
the essential element in development. The lesson of the 1990s
is that democracy isn't the luxury of the rich. Rather, the
absence of democracy is a luxury that poor countries can no
longer afford."
   But despite the sweep of democracy through Eastern Europe,
the poor countries still bristle at such suggestions.
Nigerian delegate Alhaji Abubakar Abdulkadir suggested that
the East-West cold war was being replaced by a North-South
battle. Indeed, just before he spoke on Wednesday the
conference was disrupted by an unseemly quarrel between the
Iraqi delegate and the delegate from the exiled government of
Kuwait, which the United Nations still recognizes as the
legitimate government there. The Iraqi delegate pointed out
that the $2.5 billion the U.S. was spending every month on
troops in Saudi Arabia would be better spent on poor
countries. The delegate from the United Arab Emirates
responded acidly that development aid "doesn't necessarily
mean you have to occupy another country."
   Delegates were still arguing last night over language in
the final report concerning political responsibilities. The
rich industrialized countries want the report to single out
as the best target for development "the individual . . .
which thus entails respect for and promotion of all human
rights," and add that development only works where there is
"democratic consensus."
   The poor countries have countered with language saying
that they all will "select . . . their own model of
development and ownership of means of production," and will
regard any political advice as strictly optional.
   U.N. officials were working on a compromise on this
language, and said they were confident they could also
include specific pledges of more aid in the final document.
But they also recall that the 1981 report had plenty of
pledges.
   "We thought things would get a lot better after 1981 and
they got worse," says Yves Berthelot, deputy
secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development. "It is simply not acceptable that one-tenth
of the world's population continue to be marginalized."

yet that the Swedish government is serious about airline
deregulation and trimming state ownership in Scandinavian
Airlines System.
   Bilspedition, Scandinavia's biggest freight forwarder, is
purchasing SAS's 50% holding in Linjeflyg for 475 million
Swedish kronor ($82 million). The remaining half of Linjeflyg
is controlled by AB Aerotransport, one of three
half-state-owned holding companies that own SAS under a
labyrinthine structure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Swedish government officials also held open the door
to further reduction of the state's stake in connection with
a possible stock market introduction of Linjeflyg in two to
three years.
   Reducing the state to a minority owner in Linjeflyg is an
important psychological step toward privatization of SAS,
industry analysts said. Last month, Sweden's center-left
government hinted it might also consider trimming its stake
in Aerotransport to a minority 40% if co-owners Denmark and
Norway followed suit.
   That move would be intended to facilitate SAS's planned
share exchange with Swissair under a strategic alliance
forged last year. But it sparked political grumbling,
especially among some Social Democratic Party representatives
in the Swedish parliament who remain skeptical of
privatization, or sale of state companies to private
investors.
   SAS said the sale of its Linjeflyg holding was prompted by
planned deregulation of domestic air traffic in Sweden. "Now
seems the right time to terminate our ownership interests.
SAS and Linjeflyg will gradually become competitors -- and
with the sale we avoid potential conflicts of interest,
especially when new route awards are at stake," said Jan
Carlzon, SAS chief executive officer.
   SAS currently holds a monopoly on certain domestic routes
-- such as between the capital of Stockholm and Gothenburg
and Malmoe, Sweden's second and third biggest cities. Those
routes boast almost twice the annual passenger volume of
traffic from Stockholm to northern cities such as Umea and
Sundsvall, where Linjeflyg has exclusive traffic rights. "SAS
knows we will start on Malmoe and Gothenberg as soon as
deregulation takes effect -- probably Jan. 1, 1992," said
Linjeflyg President Christer Nilsson.
   To that end, Linjeflyg has begun an aggressive
fleet-renewal program, replacing aging Fokker F28 planes with
bigger Boeing 737-500 jets. By using bigger planes, Mr.
Nilsson hopes to reduce the number of Linjeflyg's flights and
thus hold ballooning operating costs in check.
   Linjeflyg has taken delivery of three 737s to date, holds
firm orders for eight and options for 12 more planes. The
firm orders represent an investment of $300 million -- and,
if exercised, the options an additional $336 million.
   Mr. Nilsson said the airline needs to post annual
operating profit of roughly 200 million kronor to pay for the
new planes. Last year, Linjeflyg's pretax profit excluding
one-time gains from aircraft sales was about 90 million
kronor; in this year's first six months, weakened by an air
controllers' strike, operating profit skidded to 28 million
kronor.
   Bilspedition officials have some ideas about how to
bolster that anemic profit. One could be a national express
delivery service for packages and documents, tapping into
Bilspedition's computer systems and international links as
agent for United Parcel Service of America Inc., Greenwich,
Conn.
   Eventually, airline industry deregulation in Europe could
open possibilities to expand such a service -- as well as air
freight operations -- outside Scandinavia, a Bilspedition
spokesman said. The company will consider other ways to plug
Linjeflyg's biggest operating problem -- "a lot of
underutilized capacity," the spokesman added. "Linjeflyg is a
company that has a few problems ahead, but we thought the
price was fairly good."
   A domestic airline is just the latest twist in an
aggressive buying spree that nearly doubled Bilspedition's
sales during the past three years. The biggest step in that
expansion push was the purchase of shipping group
Transatlantic AB two years ago.

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Bhd.,
Malaysia's telecommunications monopoly, received regulatory
approval for a stock offering that represents the country's
biggest privatization proposal.
   The state-owned company plans to offer 470.5 million
shares, or about 24% of the company, to investors at 5
Malaysian dollars each (US$1.86). All but 147.9 million of
the shares to be offered to the public will be placed with
local institutions and STM employees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   STM will list a total of 1.97 billion shares, with the
government retaining roughly 76% through a holding company,
Minister of Finance Inc.
   Analysts had anticipated the government's decision to
place the majority of the issue to buffer the soft Malaysian
market from a flood of new shares. Many analysts had expected
the shares to be offered at M$4 each, given the market's
substantial recent decline.
   "The pricing is pretty tight," said one Malaysian analyst.
"It doesn't leave a whole lot of room for the investor."
   But STM Executive Chairman Tan Sri Datuk Mohamad Rashdan
Haji Baba said the market's downturn shouldn't hinder the
issue. "Given the steady growth of basic telecommunication
services, even during the recession years of 1985 and 1986,
we can expect the industry's growth to be strong in the long
term," he said.

   IRAN EMERGES as the biggest potential embargo buster.
   U.S. officials anticipate Tehran will allow at least some
food and medicine shipments to Iraq. It also could buy Iraqi
oil and tolerate some smuggling across its border. The
question is how much. American military officials are
confident they can stop ships from delivering large
Iraq-bound cargoes to Iranian ports, but even modest Iranian
help for Iraq could encourage other cheaters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials believe Iran wants Western aid too badly to
defy the embargo flagrantly. However, some analysts think it
may try to bolster Iraq just enough to produce a stalemate.
Worse, some fear Tehran wants the embargo to leak enough that
Washington feels compelled to launch an attack that would
destroy the Iraqi war machine Iran itself couldn't defeat.
   Militarily, Iraq can survive the embargo indefinitely. "I
don't think this embargo will hurt their military machine,"
warns Thomas McNaugher of the Brookings Institution.
                                                                                                       

   QUIET DEVALUATION: The dollar falls as the Treasury looks
the other way.
   The greenback is near a 30-year low, but the
administration emphasizes this will help the trade deficit.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Brady urges the Federal Reserve
to ease interest rates, a move that would push the dollar
lower still. Under pressure from the Fed and Congress, the
Treasury at least has stopped selling dollars to hasten the
currency's drop.
   The lure of higher interest rates abroad, combined with
fears that rising oil prices will hit the American economy
especially hard, lie behind the dollar's fall. Although a
budget agreement could bolster the American currency, the
Paris-based OECD believes depreciation will aggravate
inflation and eventually could help lead the U.S. to raise
interest rates.
                                                                                                       

   CONGRESSIONAL CRUNCH? Lawmakers face a crowded agenda.
   Despite concerns about costs, prospects are good for the
clean-air bill and for a compromise on child-care
legislation. Lawmakers advance the civil-rights bill early to
allow time for a possible veto-override attempt; former Urban
League President Vernon Jordan warns that a veto would be "a
terrible mistake," crippling Bush's relations with blacks.
   Deficit pressures portend big battles over where to cut
defense spending. Lawmakers talk about a 20% cut in the farm
bill, the proposed Mars space mission is in trouble, and
skirmishes loom over foreign aid. Sentiment also grows to
override administration objections to textile trade
protection.
   The schedule is tight, but Senate Leader Mitchell and
House Speaker Foley want to avoid a lame-duck session in
their first Congress as top leaders.
                                                                                                       

   CRIME BUSTER: The House probably will approve tougher
gun-control provisions and softer death-penalty language than
the Senate did in its crime bill. Bush has vowed to veto even
the milder Senate version, but he may find that difficult
since it includes politically popular measures aimed at
cracking down on savings and loan fraud.
                                                                                                       

   TAKING OFF? Proposals to let airports tax airline
passengers get new wings. Senate Aviation Chairman Ford has
blocked the idea, but he might back the "departure taxes" in
return for limits on airport noise restrictions. Airports
hungry for funds to finance expansion might go along; and
airlines, eager to override stringent local noise rules, like
the idea.
                                                                                                       

   BACK BURNER: Despite closer links with moderate Arabs, the
U.S. puts Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts on hold. Israeli
Foreign Minister Levy warns Baker that U.S. pressure on the
issue would bring down the government in Jerusalem. Baker
also is wary of appearing to link the Palestinian and Persian
Gulf issues.
                                                                                                       

   TEAM PLAYER: The White House enlisted former Reagan Chief
of Staff Kenneth Duberstein to help prepare it for Supreme
Court nominee Souter's confirmation hearings. Presidential
aides say Duberstein's low-key approach fits well with the
"Bush style." Predicts one top aide: "He'll clearly be asked
to do things in the future."
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS COUNTER Republican challenges in the South.
   Democrats still are optimistic Lawton Chiles will wrest
the key Florida governorship from Republican Martinez. They
also see a possible upset of the incumbent GOP governor in
Alabama; but hopes to win back the governorship in Texas
fade. All Southern incumbent Democratic senators seem safe,
and, at most, the GOP will score only minimal gains in House
races despite several retiring incumbents.
   Although the GOP hopes to end Democratic control of the
Florida Senate, the party otherwise expects few gains in
state legislative contests in Dixie. Republicans argue they
could score big gains in 1992, when population growth
probably will give them openings through reapportionment.
   But analyst Charles Cook notes: "With Republicans in the
South, every two years it's `maybe next time.'"
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Democrats complain that while NBC declined to
air their response to Bush immediately after his address, the
network lobbies against proposed government fees by arguing
that the airwaves are used for the public interest. . . .
Tommy Downs, imprisoned for fraud involving student loans,
tells senators: "The possibility of one of you gentlemen
being in my position is probably greater than the other way
around."

   Fifty Years After `Their Finest Hour'

   Tomorrow the skies of Southeast England will once again
reverberate with the sound of warbirds as 168 Royal Air Force
aircraft gather in one of the largest flypasts over London
since World War II. The occasion is the fiftieth anniversary
of the Battle of Britain, when the British will honor the men
and machines of the RAF who fought -- and triumphed -- in one
of history's greatest air battles.
   Although the battle officially commenced on July 10, 1940,
Battle of Britain Day is celebrated on September 15, the day
the RAF downed 56 Luftwaffe aircraft and broke the back of
the German assault. It was a desperate time in the history of
Britain. France had fallen. The British army had evacuated
from Dunkirk. Addressing the House of Commons on June 18,
1940, Prime Minister Winston Churchill said:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of
Britain is about to begin. . . . The whole fury and might of
the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that
he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If
we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life
of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But
if we fail, then the whole world, including the United
States, . . . will sink into the abyss of a new dark age . .
. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear
ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth
last for a thousand years, men will still say, `This was
their finest hour.'"
   Hitler planned to neutralize the Royal Navy by attacking
its vessels in the English Channel, then to eliminate the RAF
and, finally, if necessary, to bomb British cities. Hitler
never imagined that he would have to proceed to the third
stage of the plan, since he was convinced that the Luftwaffe
would gain superiority over the RAF, forcing Britain to
surrender.
   It is questionable whether the RAF could have withstood
the Germans had it not been for Winston Churchill. Ostracized
from politics after his disastrous performance as finance
minister in the 1920s, and labeled a military failure because
of the defeat of the Gallipoli landings he had advocated
during World War I, Churchill had spent the 1930s warning the
British government of German rearmament. With dogged
determination, Churchill persuaded the government to increase
the RAF's budget from $35 million to $150 million between
1934 and 1938.
   On the eve of the Battle of Britain, there were almost
3,000 pilots in RAF Fighter Command. Some 2,353 of these were
British; the remainder were volunteers from other countries,
including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa,
France, Belgium, the U.S., Poland and Czechoslovakia. Many of
the pilots in the battle became legends in their own time.
Among them were Douglas Bader, the legless ace, Peter
Townsend, one-time suitor of Princess Margaret, New Zealander
Al Deere, later an Air Vice-Marshall and South African
"Sailor" Malan, a top scoring ace and brilliant leader.
   A handful of Americans fought in the RAF during the Battle
of Britain and made an impact far out of proportion to their
numbers. Pilot Officers E. Q. "Red" Tobin, D. Mamedoff and V.
C. "Shorty" Keogh, flew Spitfires with 609 Squadron based at
Middle Wallop. After the battle, they transferred to the
first of the Eagle Squadrons, the all-American squadrons of
the RAF. Pilot Officer H.W. Reilley served with 64 and 66
Squadrons flying Spitfires, while Flight Lieutenant C.R.
Davis flew Hurricanes with 601 Squadron based at Tangmere.
Perhaps the most renowned American pilot to serve in the
Battle of Britain was Pilot Officer William "Billy" Fiske of
601 Squadron. His Flight Commander, Sir Archibald Hope,
reputedly said that Fiske was the best pilot he had ever
known, and that he was "terribly nice and extraordinarily
modest."
   Facing the RAF was Air Marshall Hermann Goering's
Luftwaffe, an elite group of superbly trained pilots,
prepared for battle by their experiences in the Spanish Civil
War, and the invasion of Poland and Western Europe.
   The most famous of the Luftwaffe pilots were Adolph
Galland and Werner Molders. The rivalry between these two was
legendary. At the end of the Battle of Britain, Molders was
credited with downing 54 Allied aircraft and Galland with 52,
although both were overshadowed by Helmut Wick, who scored 56
victories before being shot down in November 1940.
   The RAF had suffered heavy losses in the fight for France.
In July 1940, the RAF was left with 331 Spitfires and
Hurricanes, and 150 second line fighters: Blenheims, Defiants
and Gladiators. The second line fighters were cumbersome and
ineffective, and it was left to the Spitfire and Hurricane to
bear the brunt of the battle.
   The Supermarine Spitfire, with its Rolls-Royce Merlin
engine, had a maximum speed of 362 mph. The Hawker Hurricane,
also powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin, could reach a top speed
of 328 mph. While the Spitfire has captured the imagination
of the world with its sleek lines, it was the Hurricane that
would make the most significant contribution in the summer of
1940, claiming 80% of the German losses credited to RAF
Fighter Command.
   The front line fighter of the Luftwaffe was the Bf-109.
Designed by Willy Messerschmitt, and powered by a Daimler
Benz engine, the Bf-109 had a top speed of 357 mph, faster
than the Hurricane but slower than the Spitfire. Regardless
of speed, the Bf-109 was not as maneuverable as the Spitfire
or Hurricane, and this gave the RAF a decisive edge.
   Between early July and mid-August, 1940, the Luftwaffe
launched a series of effective strikes against British
shipping in the Channel, and against coastal targets. The RAF
was desperately short of aircraft, and Britain's aircraft
manufacturers began producing Spitfires and Hurricanes at an
accelerated rate. By Aug. 11, the RAF had shot down 274
German aircraft; it had lost 124 of its own.
   On Aug. 13, Goering launched the "Adlerangriff," or "Eagle
Attack," intended to annihilate the RAF. Between Aug. 13 and
24, some of the most spectacular aerial battles took place,
mainly over Southeast England and the Channel: 283 German
aircraft were downed, and 133 British.
   The battle entered a new phase between Aug. 24 and Sept. 6
when, in addition to attacking airfields and industrial
targets, the Luftwaffe commenced the night bombing of
provincial towns in a last bid to crush British resistance.
During this period, aircraft losses were high on both sides.
Suddenly, on Sept. 7, the Luftwaffe carried out the first of
a series of raids on London in what became known as the
"Blitz." While London was to endure punishing bombardment for
several months, the diversion of the Luftwaffe's energies and
resources to the bombing of London represented a major shift
in strategic objective, and gave the RAF the respite it
needed to regroup. Many regard this as the decision that
enabled the RAF to prevail. On Sept. 17, Hitler's invasion
plans were postponed indefinitely. While attacks on RAF
stations continued through the end of October, and the London
blitz did not end until early 1941, the RAF -- and Britain --
had survived.
   Other factors favored the RAF too. The limited fuel supply
of the Bf-109 gave the German fighter pilots little time to
operate after crossing the Channel, frequently forcing them
to leave the bombers unescorted. The Luftwaffe's bomber
pilots could not communicate by radio with their fighter
escorts, making coordination in the air extremely difficult.
The RAF's radar was also an important advantage. Fighter
Command was able to identify German aircraft as they crossed
the Channel and could "scramble" its fighter squadrons to
intercept enemy raiders with devastating accuracy. Finally,
and perhaps most importantly, the RAF pilots were possessed
of an indomitable fighting spirit. They simply refused to
surrender. It was of them that Churchill said, "Never in the
history of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so
few."

   Meeting of G-7
   Is Unlikely to Act
   To Bolster Dollar

   LONDON -- When deputies from the Group of Seven gathered
in Paris this week, they reportedly expressed little dismay
about the falling U.S. dollar.
   Economists predict that the mood of acceptance will extend
to the official G-7 meeting in Washington a week from
tomorrow. Specifically, forecasters expect financial leaders
to stand by rather than intervene in the currency markets,
even though the U.S. currency recently slumped to 1.53 German
marks, a postwar low. "We're not looking for the G-7 to do
anything at this stage," said Julian Callow, international
economist with Chase Investment Bank Ltd.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The G-7 countries are the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   Mr. Callow and other Chase economists take the position
that the G-7, officially the world's most powerful economic
club, is in "demise," with each of the big economies going
its own way for a time. The Chase team also predicts that the
dollar will test new lows of 1.50 marks and 125 yen in the
next three to six months.
   "My feeling is that the economic fundamentals would
indicate that the dollar should fall," said Bill Martin,
chief economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. "It looks
like the U.S. economy is moving into recession and that the
Fed will ease" up by dropping interest rates.
   European economists aren't very worried about the dollar's
slide. "There's no reason for action now," said Adolf
Ahnefeld, corporate economist at Bosch G.m.b.H. "The present
value of the dollar is about right."
   With the American economy edging toward recession,
Europeans are cheered to see a glimmer of good news in the
export picture. "European firms will mostly benefit from
stronger U.S. economic activity," said Sudhir Junankar,
economist with the Confederation of British Industries in
London. "Higher exports make the U.S. less prone to full
recession, and that's good news."
   But if the dollar stays low, Europe could find itself
inundated with comparatively cheap American products, warned
David Mars, an economist with S.G. Warburg Securities in
London. "The U.S. exports everything from vegetables to jumbo
jets," he argued. "There's a tendency (in Europe) to
underestimate the competitive pressure." He said he foresees
a day when U.S. exports could force price cuts in Europe, and
lead to calls for the G-7 to prop up the U.S. currency.
   Another possibility is that the U.S. will be forced to
keep rates higher than its sluggish economy would otherwise
dictate, in order to compete for international savings it
needs to finance its budget deficit. That could make it
harder for the U.S. to jump-start its economy out of the
current slump. However, the Chase report warned, "other G-7
members aren't likely to be prepared to `bail out' the U.S.
by inflating."

   PARIS (AP) -- France's major liquor manufacturers offered
to contribute millions of dollars to alcoholism prevention
programs if the government backed off a plan to prohibit
liquor ads.
   The companies also proposed the creation of a commission
representing the public and private sectors to regulate
liquor advertising.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposals were drafted by a group of executives from
Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Pernod Ricard, Champagne de
Venoge, Martini &amp; Rossi France, Seagram France and other
companies.
   Thierry Mantoux, chief executive of Champagne de Venoge,
said the industry contribution would be in proportion to the
amount of money each company spent on advertising. He
predicted that tens of millions of francs would be generated
for alcoholism prevention.
   Parliament earlier this year approved a plan by Health
Minister Claude Evin to ban tobacco and alcohol advertising
starting in 1993.

   HONG KONG -- The launch of the Korea Asia Fund, a $100
million mutual fund investing solely in South Korean
equities, was postponed because of uncertain market
conditions and weak investor interest.
   "We'll watch the market day by day," said a spokesman for
Salomon Brothers International Ltd., one of the four lead
managers. "The launch date is still uncertain." The other
lead managers are Yamaichi International (HK) Ltd., Dongsuh
Securities Co. and Coryo Securities Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The fund, the third foreign-managed stock mutual fund
investing solely in Korea, was scheduled to reach the market
yesterday. But prospects soured in the poor market
environment that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Analysts
also noted that a flood of stock issues in Korea during the
past six months has saturated the market.
   Korea's Finance Ministry, which was eager for the new
issue, is likely to insist that the launch take place fairly
soon. Besides delaying a desired infusion of capital, the
postponement threw a shadow over other expected issues. Two
Korean companies, Kolon Industries Ltd. and Jindo Corp., were
planning to float convertible bonds soon but now are expected
to wait until the Korea Asia Fund gets off the ground.

   BRASILIA -- Brazil signed a letter of intent to the
International Monetary Fund and pledged to resume debt
renegotiations with creditors this month.
   The letter was the result of drawn-out negotiations that
reportedly nearly fell through over disagreement about a
token payment to creditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello said Brazil
wouldn't make any symbolic payment of arrears to creditors of
the country's $117 billion foreign debt, the largest in the
Third World.
   "We want a constructive, definitive and quick solution,"
the official said.
   In the letter, Brazil requested a standby loan of $2.016
billion, to be released in six parcels by February 1992.
   The government also outlined goals for growth, the budget
deficit and reducing 4,274% inflation.
   Some of the targets are: negative growth of 3% for gross
national product this year; a spending surplus of 0.5% of GNP
this year and 0% in 1991; 25% annual inflation in 1991; a
reduction of the deficit of government-owned companies from
2.5% of GNP in 1989 to 1% this year and 0% in 1991.

   Buena Vista, Colo. -- Unless someone was standing atop
Mounts Whitney, Elbert or Massive at 10:50 a.m., Mountain
Daylight Time, three Thursdays ago, Ray Sokolov and I were
the two highest fellas in the contiguous U.S. of A. At or
about that time, we scrambled to the summit of Mount Harvard,
14,420 feet above sea level.
   That's right. We climbed it. All the way. To the top.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was, without question, my greatest moment as a
mountaineer. Ray, who is editor of this page, has loftier
achievements to his credit, such as baking a cake on Mount
Whitney in California, which at 14,495 feet is the tallest in
the 48. But he, too, basked in the glory of the feat.
   As we stood there, perusing the panorama, the interesting
geological fact came to mind that Mount Harvard is just a bit
shorter than nearby Mounts Elbert (14,433 feet) and Massive
(14,421), the only two higher peaks in the Rockies.
   "What if I stood on your shoulders? Would that make us the
highest point in Colorado?" I asked.
   "What if I stood on yours?" he replied.
   After brief consideration, we rejected both propositions.
The footing was a mite shaky, and even if we did it nobody
would believe us.
   But, what the heck, we'd done what we'd come for, and that
was plenty good enough. Standing on my first significant
summit, I knew why people climbed mountains. It's not so much
that they're there, it's that the view from the peak is so
wonderful. Only from the top can you see both sides of
something.
   If you are just tuning in to this column, some background
on this mountaineering business might be in order. Mount
Harvard is the third ascent attempted by the team of Klein
and Sokolov, which I so list for purely alphabetical reasons.
The idea was to convey the joys of mountain hiking -- we're
not talking rope-and-piton climbing here -- to a broad
public. We are middle-aged men in OK, but not sensational,
physical shape. We figured that if we could do it, so could
almost anyone.
   Our first outing, in 1985, was up the above-mentioned
Mount Massive, just north of here in Central Colorado's
Sawatch Range. We climbed well but not wisely, winding up in
a kind of rocky cul de sac 150 feet from the top with
daylight waning. Not being totally crazy, we called it a day.
Ray's new boots produced painful blisters, and the walk down
introduced me to leg muscles I never knew I had.
   It took four years to get us back on the slopes together,
and the next time we picked an easier target. Last September,
along with two guys from the estimable publication Texas
Monthly, we scaled Mount Guadalupe, at 8,751 feet the highest
peak in the Lone Star State. This time the trail went all the
way to the top, so even we couldn't go astray. It was fun,
and emboldened us to try again.
   We picked Mount Harvard because of its impressive height,
scenic locale and accessibility to non-experts. Also, we both
had attended the institution for which it is named. Ray holds
a degree from there in something suitably arcane, like Greek
and Latin studies. I went to the law school only long enough
to make a list of 368 reasons I didn't want to be a lawyer.
   Along with Mounts Yale, Columbia and Princeton, Mount
Harvard is among the so-called Collegiate Peaks. Mounts
Harvard and Yale, a few miles apart, were named by members of
an 1869 expedition led by the intrepid Josiah Whitney. He was
a graduate of Yale and professor of geology at Harvard. The
fact that he named the taller peak after his employer (Mount
Yale measures 14,196 feet) shows that he knew on what side
his bread was buttered. He might have named it for himself,
but he'd already claimed Mount Whitney.
   Our plan was to make the climb in two days to give our
sea-level-bound lungs time to adjust to the altitude. We
arrived in Denver on Tuesday and drove to little Fairplay, at
10,000 feet, to spend the night. My hotel room was on the
second floor, and carrying my suitcase up the one flight of
stairs had me breathing heavily. If anyone needed
acclimatizing, it was me.
   A night's sleep proved beneficial, though, because the
next morning, after driving to the trailhead, we backpacked
the three miles to our campsite in the Horn Fork Basin
beneath the Continental Divide, at about 11,500 feet, with no
ill effects. Ray supplied the tent, one of those new,
featherweight jobs, and it looked comfortable enough. I'd
last camped out in 1962, during Army basic training, and
swore never to do it again (they made us sleep with our
rifles]), but figured one night couldn't be too bad.
   I was wrong. At about 7 p.m. it began to rain, and there
was nowhere to go but the tent. At 8 it was still raining and
dark, and there was nothing to do but sleep. I awoke at 3
a.m. ready to go, but the day wasn't. The next three hours,
listening to Ray snore in the wet, cold blackness, were among
my longest.
   Thursday dawned blessedly clear, and we were on the trail
before 7 a.m. In short order we tromped through the treeline,
"krummholz" (stunted trees and stuff) and alpine tundra. At
about 13,000 feet, at beautiful Bear Lake, the trail petered
out, but we were not dismayed. Confidently reading the rock
(that's mountaineer talk), we approached the summit from the
southeast, first encountering serious boulders at about
13,500 feet. Ray suggested I think of them as large,
irregular steps, and that helped. They proved easier to
negotiate than some grassy-but-steep stretches.
   The last 100 or so feet were a real scramble. At one point
I found myself holding on to a rock while swinging a leg over
a chasm (well, a 10-foot drop) in search of a foothold. But,
like I said, we made it all the way up, and down too.
   Even Ray, the mountain vet, was impressed with our final
push; he rated it a 4 on a 5-point scale of difficulty. I
later talked to Ron Bentall, a trip leader for the Colorado
Mountain Club who has climbed all 53 of the state's
14,000-plus-foot mountains, and he laughed that it was a 2,
or, maybe, a 3. He agreed, though, that we had a right to
feel proud of our effort.
   We were, and now are looking forward and upward. Anyone
know where we can get a Nepali phrasebook?

   Japanese Business Failures
   Dropped 8.6% in August

   TOKYO -- The number of Japanese corporate bankruptcies,
maintaining a downward trend, dropped 8.6% to 513 in August
from a year earlier, a private credit agency said.
   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd. noted, however, that the number of
business failures resulting from labor shortages came to a
record 35 in the month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Because of continued favorable economic conditions and
changes in the country's industrial structure now under way,
labor shortages are becoming more serious regardless of area
or industry," it said. "As a result, the number of companies
finding themselves in trouble has been increasing sharply."
   Japan's economy has been expanding for 46 months in a row
because of robust domestic demand such as corporate equipment
investment and personal spending. In the process of
expansion, however, it has created serious manpower shortages
in the country.
   Agency officials said bankruptcies related to labor
shortages have totaled 157 so far this year, already
considerably more than the 128 recorded for the entire year
of 1989. The August total was larger, though only by one
case, than the previous monthly record of 34 set in July.

   Shell Fund Sticks to New Plan to Boost
   Equity Holdings, Despite Market Chaos

   RIJSWIJK, the Netherlands -- Talk about timing.
   Shell Pensioenfonds Beheer B.V. got permission from its
trustees to load up on equities shortly before Iraq's Saddam
Hussein threw the global stock market into confusion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's a roller coaster ride for shares at the moment,"
said Jan de Kreij, general manager of the fund, which manages
13 billion Dutch guilders ($7.36 billion) of investments for
Dutch employees of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Fortunately,
the fund didn't jump onto the roller coaster right away. Mr.
de Kreij said in an interview that the fund is sticking to
its long-term plan to raise the equity portion of its
portfolio to about 50% from 35%, but that it won't make any
big purchases until the Mideast situation becomes clearer.
   While the fund hasn't sold shares during the scare, it is
buying only in a selective way. For example, Mr. de Kreij
said, the fund recently bought a small amount of Japanese
technology shares, which he declined to identify. The fund
was already fairly heavy on oil shares, which are benefiting
from the surge in petroleum prices.
   Mr. de Kreij and his colleagues can hardly be accused of
impulsive investing. Their change in long-term strategy is
the result of nearly two years of study.
   The Shell fund is considered among the best-managed in the
Netherlands, rival managers said. Mr. de Kreij refused to
give figures comparing his team's performance with other
funds. But he noted that one gauge of performance is the
level of contributions that are needed from workers and the
company to meet the fund's liabilities. Because investment
returns have grown, the fund has been able to let
contributions decline in recent years to about 220 million
guilders in 1989 from 547 million guilders in 1985, even
though the fund's pension liabilities continued to rise.
   But Mr. de Kreij said the fund still believes it can
improve its performance and figures it will need more
investment income as its liabilities grow. (Under the Dutch
pension system, retirees typically receive 70% of their final
salary, with periodic adjustments to cover inflation.)
   Because shares tend to perform better than bonds and
property in the long term, the fund figured it should raise
the equity portion of its portfolio -- even though this would
mean more volatility. To test its hunch, the fund used market
data from the past 40 years to check how it would have
performed under various investment strategies. It found that,
indeed, the highest returns would have come from investing
100% in shares.
   But such a strategy would mean too much volatility, Mr. de
Kreij said. The level of pension contributions needed from
the company could vary wildly from year to year, making the
company's earnings performance choppier.
   So the fund managers decided it would be more prudent to
aim for a long-term average of about 50% shares, 30% property
and 20% bonds. The fund now is about 35% shares, 45% bonds
and 20% property.
   Even before the new strategy was adopted, Shell's fund
carried more equity than the typical pension fund in the
Netherlands, where it is common to keep 80% in bonds and
divide the rest between shares and property. That stance
partly reflects a cautious approach and partly the relatively
small size of the Dutch stock market, which limits equity
opportunities for funds that don't want to take currency
risks by investing abroad.
   British and U.S. funds tend to hold a higher proportion of
their assets in shares. Shell's new guideline puts it roughly
in line with the typical U.S. corporate pension fund. In a
1988 survey, the latest available, the U.S. consulting firm
Greenwich Associates found that American corporate funds held
an average of about 49% of their assets in shares.
   The same survey found that only about 1/10th of the U.S.
funds' equity investments were outside the U.S. By contrast,
Shell's new strategy increases the fund's limit on
investments outside the Netherlands to about 50% from 30%.
   As the Shell fund pays its retirees in guilders, currency
risks are a serious concern. But Mr. de Kreij figures the
problem is manageable, as long as the fund spreads its
investments in a variety of currencies to balance risks.
   In its equity investing, the Shell fund doesn't try to
pick a few hot stocks -- a course considered too risky and
unlikely to succeed over the long haul. Instead, it aims for
a broad spread of investments reflecting the entire economy.
"If you can outperform real growth in the economy, you should
be happy," Mr. de Kreij said.

   Rise in Hurricanes Off U.S. East Coast
   Is Forecast, Using Study of African Rain

   Hurricane activity off the U.S. East Coast will intensify,
warned a weather researcher who reported a new method for
predicting Atlantic tropical storms.
   William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at
Colorado State University and a hurricane forecasting
specialist, said he uncovered a strong association between
seasonal rainfall in West Africa and the formation of intense
hurricanes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Based on the new findings, Mr. Gray predicted earlier this
summer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be above
average, and so far he seems to be right. In July he said
there would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of which
six would be hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center said
that as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this
year, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal.
   Weather researchers have been seeking to predict hurricane
patterns more accurately as an early warning for coastal
residents of the U.S. and the Caribbean. A sharp decrease in
hurricane activity over the past two decades spurred business
and residential development that would be vulnerable to
increased hurricane activity.
   Mr. Gray said the West African Sahel region is the newest
of five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane
activity. Atlantic hurricanes form from especially strong
tropical storms that are triggered by winds and other air
disturbances that sweep across Africa. Wind moving across
warm ocean air causes powerful updrafts of air bearing sea
water that eventually turn into rainclouds. Mr. Gray said he
believes that in the absence of moisture, these storms
quickly dissipate, but that the storms gather strength with
additional moisture.
   Mr. Gray said his research, published in the current issue
of Science, suggests that "intense Caribbean hurricanes
Gilbert, Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the
forerunners of this change."
   Comparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel with
the number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Mr. Gray
found a striking correlation. From 1947 to 1969, for
instance, rainfall in the western Sahel was especially
abundant, and during this time there were 13 severe
hurricanes that formed in the Atlantic Ocean. From 1970 to
1988, the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought, and
hurricane activity was unusually low; only one severe
hurricane, Gloria in 1985, formed in the area.
   Mr. Gray searched back in recent history and found that
the Sahel, which includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali
and Gambia, goes through long periods of alternating dry and
wet weather. He found that the Sahel was especially wet from
1870 to 1900 and from 1915 to 1935. Hurricane activity was
much higher during this time than during intervals when the
Sahel was dry.
   Mr. Gray predicted that, based on historical cycles, the
Sahel is entering a wet period. He said the drought
conditions ended in 1988 and 1989. He based his 1990 storm
forecast on the higher-than-normal rainfall in the Sahel in
July. Mr. Gray said his research suggests that climate
changes in the Sahel don't result from global warming
problems associated with environmental pollution but from
natural weather cycles.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Bookshelf:
   New York as the City of Light (])
   ----
   By Donald Lyons

   With New York City increasingly identified with despair
and darkness, it is a surprise to find a hopeful visionary
stalking its public ways. Such is Tony Hiss, who, in "The
Experience of Place" (Knopf, 233 pages, $19.95), sees our
town as a place for illuminations and intense moments of
mystical absorption.
   In an idiosyncratic and appealing way, Mr. Hiss, a writer
for the New Yorker, savors some selflessly rapt
contemplations of the manifold ways certain places -- in and
outside of New York City -- can refresh and fortify the human
spirit. He dwells above all on the qualities of light.
Mystics love light. Entering the main concourse of Grand
Central Station, he feels in his pulse a cooperative hum, the
choreography of the city, and sees a "different light:
grayer, clearer, brighter."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Times Square, he stands by the statue of George M.
Cohan, songwriter of "energy and bounce and beat," and revels
in the sun: ". . . the sun can seem the closest thing around,
and then everything else, even sun-filled air, begins to seem
slightly farther away -- somewhere on the other side of an
enveloping glow." (Significantly, it is at least as much the
shadow as the hulking Marriott Hotel itself that Mr. Hiss
finds to blight Times Square.) By night, "the great neon
signs have almost surrounded the square with flashing light."
Socialized light might be Mr. Hiss's definition of happiness.
   Perhaps the book's most exalted description is of the
simple act of walking through a tunnel in Prospect Park
(Olmsted &amp; Vaux's greatest New York creation) and emerging
out into "the beautiful, undulating Long Meadow," six times
the size of Central Park's Sheep Meadow. ". . . on almost any
day of the year the whole area is flooded with light," he
writes. "The light seems almost to be converging on the
meadow from all directions -- tumbling onto the grass nearby
and also glowing through the trees beyond the meadow." Being
pulled forward into this meadow causes the walker to feel
welcome, safe, full of wonder, he thinks.
   The bliss that Mr. Hiss derives from these democratic
sites (even the immense and banal World Trade Center does not
fail him in this respect) is never a purely private but
always a communal and a potentially utopian one.
   At such stirring moments Mr. Hiss's sensibility, delicate
but vigorous, solipsistic yet sociable, can remind us of the
feelings Willa Cather evoked in her descriptions of the
Southwest. I am thinking of "The Professor's House," in which
she writes, "Once again I had that glorious feeling that I've
never had anywhere else . . . And the air, my God, what air]
-- Soft, tingling, gold, hot with an edge of chill in it . .
. it was like breathing the sun, breathing the color of the
sky."
   But if Cather wove her perceptions into novels, Mr. Hiss's
are too often embedded in a chipperly curious New Yorkeresque
essay style, urging a familiar ecological humanism. A
scholarly supporting cast pops up with a flavor worthy of a
Preston Sturges cast: Dr. Schwartz of Yale has found that the
smell of spiced apple reduces blood pressure; the Kaplans, a
husband-and-wife team from the University of Michigan, think
we have an inborn preference for winding paths; the worthy
"tree lady of Brooklyn" drops by; a German landscaper
explains a new theory of harmoniously planted golf courses; a
geography professor from the University of Delaware finds
looking at trees helps gall-bladder patients recover.
   This gathering of my-isn't-that-interesting tidbits often
struggles unsuccessfully toward the synoptic coherence of a
discipline. But it is mainly the wan placidity of these
informational sections that disappoints, after the white
light of Mr. Hiss's visionary ecstasies.
   A good foil to the authenticity of Mr. Hiss's attempts to
feel himself generously into the souls of places is the
egotistical phoniness of French pundit Jean Baudrillard's
"Cool Memories" (Verso, 234 pages, $45 hardcover, $15.95
paperback), an impressionistic diary from his California
years in the early '80s. The book reminds us that the French
tradition of aphoristic "pensees," from Montaigne and Pascal
through Barthes, has a lot to answer for. Mr. Baudrillard
manages to wed the lapel-grabbing triviality of Andy Rooney
("Have you noticed that flies and wasps die off less and less
in winter?") to the moral philosophy of Hugh Hefner ("To make
you wish to seduce her, a woman should not show herself too
inclined toward rape . . .").
   The overall image we take from this absurd book is of Mr.
Baudrillard in those crazy party years, being tickled in the
Jacuzzi while scribbling his tedious apercus about Dallas in
the wet margins of his Sartre. "It feels so good," he trills
at one point, "to disappear among the masses]" Go right
ahead, Buster, be my guest.
   By the way, a wonderful appreciation of the way American
writers like Cather -- and Thoreau and Twain and Faulkner --
used landscape can be found in Frederick Turner's "Spirit of
Place" (Sierra Club, 381, $24.95). After showing how his
chosen writers related to their land, Mr. Turner goes himself
to have a look today at these fabled spots, often with
disconcerting results.

   Good Will Eludes China in Asian Games

   BEIJING -- Matthew Mouw, bedecked in a bright yellow
outfit plastered with the M&amp;Ms candy logo, zips along
Beijing's boulevards on his 21-speed bike.
   Every few blocks, he stops at a drab state-owned shop to
cajole clerks into peddling M&amp;Ms. He tries to lure them with
a promotional display that features Pan Pan, the panda mascot
of the next week's Asian Games, running through a soccer
stadium filled with M&amp;Ms.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "My job is to cheer people up and make the Asian Games fun
because M&amp;Ms is a fun product," says Mr. Mouw, a 29-year-old
promoter for Mars Inc. of McClean, Va., an Asian Games
sponsor.
   Despite Mr. Mouw's attempts to stir up excitement, most of
Beijing's population of 11 million seem more in the mood for
a funeral than a festival.
   What was supposed to be China's day in the sun can't
escape the cloud of the June 4, 1989, massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators. "People have mixed feelings
about the Asian Games," says a 26-year-old railway worker.
"It's good for China if the games are a success, but this
would also give credibility to the government leaders -- and
many people can't stand the thought of that."
   The Tiananmen Square massacre has put the Asian Games in a
financial bind. The government had budgeted $125 million, or
one-quarter of the games' cost, to be paid by commercial
sponsorships, with any shortfall to be made up with voluntary
donations. The remaining $415 million is being paid by the
government through deficit spending.
   But only about a dozen foreign companies have signed up,
and it appears that all of them signed contracts prior to the
Tiananmen crackdown. It also appears that only a fraction of
the hoped-for money from foreign sponsors has materialized.
So the government has resorted to pressuring state-run
industries and Beijing's workers.
   When the Asian Games were being planned in the mid-1980s,
China saw the event as a prelude to its getting the Olympic
Games in 2000. Advertisers were expected to clamor for the
chance to rent stadium billboards, launch balloons and paste
their names across athletes' uniforms.
   On Sept. 22, as many as 100,000 tourists and 2,000 foreign
journalists from 38 participating countries are expected in
Beijing for the quadrennial event. The games will be
broadcast live to Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and
Singapore as well as the oil shiekdoms of the Middle East.
   As a result, the games provide foreign companies a chance
for high-profile exposure of their brand names in consumer
markets that are often either too expensive, or too closed,
to reach through domestic advertising.
   Games organizers are embarrassed about the lack of foreign
support, so they refuse to release any details about
commercial sponsorship. The foreign sponsors are forbidden by
their contracts from disclosing the prices they paid.
   But from documents obtained privately, it appears that
Asian Games organizers collected between $20 million to $30
million from foreign commercial sponsors. Only 230 of the
1,755 stadium advertising billboards were leased by foreign
sponsors. The rest were given away at fire-sale prices to
state industries.
   "No sponsor who had signed a deal backed off. Everybody
considered the June 4 event, but it was impossible to back
out," says a foreign sponsor who requests anonymity. Backing
out would have angered the Chinese and put at risk a
corporation's chances at future business in China.
   The major sponsors of the games include Konica Corp. and
Fuji Photo Film Co. of Japan, Samsung Co. and Goldstar Co. of
South Korea, Mars, Coca-Cola Co., and American Express Co. of
the U.S. and Adidas AG of West Germany.
   To please these companies, Beijing authorities have bent
over backwards. Until recently, the most prominent signs in
Beijing carried such messages as "Happily, happily go to
work, safely, safely return home." Now the city is ablaze
with "Melts In Your Mouth, Not In Your Hand." Additionally,
companies such as Mars have parlayed Asian Games sponsorship
into permission to begin selling their products in local
stores, thereby giving them a crack at China's gargantuan
consumer market of 1.2 billion.
   The huge shortfall is being squeezed from the pockets of
workers and coffers of state factories. Several dozen state
factories have become major Asian Games sponsors at a time
when about one-third of the central government spending is
earmarked for subsidies to state industries.
   Beijing's workers, who average $330 in annual wages, are
seeing their paychecks docked by 20% or more for Asian Games
"donations." Teachers are soliciting money from
schoolchildren. Local companies connected with foreign
businesses are given a 10% commission on donations they
extract from their foreign partners.
   "The pressure is very strong because the more you give the
more you prove your loyalty to the government," says a
37-year-old Chinese office worker.
   Asian Games officials say that all donations are supposed
to be voluntary. They add that they have no control over
fundraising techniques. "This is fund raising with Chinese
characteristics," says Wang Zhiliang, director of games fund
raising.
   Meanwhile, state media outlets are doing their best to
create an air of enthusiasm. Beijing newspapers report that
due to Asian Games-spirit, a 100-day campaign by the masses
has come close to eradicating Beijing's flies, mosquitoes,
rats and cockroaches.
   The city's 30,000 public toilet cleaners are so enthused,
according to one report, that they've picked up 560,000 tons
of sewage in the past month, a 20% increase from a year ago.
But newspapers admit that a few aren't cooperating. Among
them are five farmers on the outskirts of Beijing who were
arrested after they used homemade rifles to shoot down
carrier pigeons being trained for the festivities.
   The most noticeable byproduct of the games is tight
security. Armed police man late-night roadblocks.
Plainclothes cops roam the streets by day. Mentally ill
people and peasants who've come to Beijing seeking work, both
"major elements of instability," are being carted away.
   "The government is desperately worried that something will
happen again, but that is unlikely," says a foreign diplomat.
"People know this isn't the big one, the big one will be when
somebody dies," he adds, referring to the possibility that
one of China's aged top leaders will soon die.
   The games organizers admit that last year's
"counterrevolutionary rebellion" has caused difficulties. But
they say that if the Asian Games are free of major blunders
or violent incidents, the outside world will realize that
China is now stable. And this, the organizers say, will lure
foreign tourists back and help China get the Olympics in the
year 2000.
   "This is a chance for us to make friends with the world
again," says Wu Zhongyuan, spokesman for the Asian Games.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices took a dive under pressure from
program selling that was sparked by a midday jump in oil
prices and a rumor of war.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 43.07 points in
light trading to 2582.67, the lowest level since 2532.92 on
Aug. 24. The dollar was sharply lower for the second
consecutive day, this time because comments by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan heightened traders'
expectation that U.S. interest rates will drop soon. But bond
traders weren't inspired; bond prices edged lower in very
quiet trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Peter Grennan, head of stock-index futures trading at
Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the September futures contract
on Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell to its lowest level
since Labor Day as the October crude oil futures contract
surged to $31.45 a barrel; the contract fell back to end at
$31.07, up 10 cents.
   The drop in stock-index futures dashed some investors'
hopes that stock prices were poised to move up. It also
attracted program traders, who swooped in to capture profits
by buying the cheaper futures and selling stocks.
   Mr. Grennan noted this was the fourth consecutive Thursday
the market posted a substantial loss. Previously, the heavy
selling had been on three successive Fridays. Mr. Grennan
said investors may be trying to beat each other out the door
so they aren't hurt by any Mideast developments or other
surprises over the weekend.
   Adding to the downward pressure on stocks, traders said,
was an unfounded midafternoon rumor, apparently originating
in commodities futures pits, that a television news program
reported Mideast war would erupt within hours.
   Trading in the dollar was relatively quiet until Mr.
Greenspan told the House Banking Committee that the Fed would
likely push interest rates lower if Congress and the Bush
administration produced a credible pact to cut the U.S.
budget deficit. That remark sparked a sell-off, which
deepened when the Fed chairman went on to acknowledge that
the U.S. banking system is facing serious problems.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 123.4 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues swamped
advancers 1,009 to 430.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices eased nearly 1/8 point, or almost $1.25 for
each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond rose slightly to 8.96%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5677 marks and 136.20 yen, compared with
1.5913 marks and 138.09 yen Wednesday.

   WASHINGTON -- Although the nation's banks face serious
problems, the industry isn't headed for a disaster on the
magnitude of the savings-and-loan crisis, Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said.
   Testifying before the House Banking Committee, Mr.
Greenspan endorsed the idea of raising banks'
deposit-insurance premiums, a move that the administration
and an increasing number of lawmakers support.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Greenspan also reiterated that the Fed would probably
lower interest rates if Congress and the administration reach
a "credible and enforceable" agreement to reduce the federal
budget deficit. It was the first time the chairman has made
such comments since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent oil
prices soaring and heightened fears of resurgent inflation.
   Government officials have grown increasingly anxious over
the health of the nation's banks in the wake of the
multibillion-dollar thrift bailout. New alarms clanged this
week when two congressional agencies warned that the federal
insurance fund that protects bank depositors was dangerously
low.
   But Mr. Greenspan said the banking industry is much
sounder than its sister thrift industry was several years
ago, when problems that led to the failure of thousands of
S&amp;Ls and the huge taxpayer bailout were beginning to fester.
Banks' levels of capital are higher, he said, and banking
regulation is tougher. He also said bank assets are
shorter-term than those of thrifts, allowing banks to more
easily balance their borrowing costs with lending rates.
   Consequently, the Fed chairman said, "The chance of having
the type of problems with banks that we have with thrifts is
very significantly lower."
   But Mr. Greenspan agreed that the deposit-insurance fund
"is under stress" with fund reserves, as a percentage of
insured deposits, at a record low. He also said banks are
threatened by an increasing number of sour real-estate loans
brought on by a downturn in commercial real estate.
   Mr. Greenspan said he would favor enhancing the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.'s authority to borrow from the
Treasury to cope with any shortages in the insurance fund
while Congress is working on changes in deposit insurance.
The FDIC currently has a $5 billion line of credit with the
Treasury, but has never used it.
   If insurance premiums are raised, Mr. Greenspan said,
officials must take great care to set a level that wouldn't
push some institutions into insolvency. He suggested the
FDIC, which manages both bank and thrift deposit-insurance
funds, determine a new ceiling on insurance premiums. The
premium on thrift deposits is 23 cents per $100 of deposits,
and the premium for banks is set to rise 4.5 cents next year
to 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits.
   The chairmen of the Banking committees, Sen. Donald Riegle
(D., Mich.) and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), yesterday
introduced bills that would give regulators the authority to
raise bank deposit-insurance premiums.
   There is no question that the insurance fund has led banks
to take risks, knowing that the government would protect
their deposit funds, Mr. Greenspan said. It has also kept
depositors from scrutinizing the soundness of the
institutions they choose to house their money, he said.
   Mr. Greenspan said raising the requirements for bank
capital and strengthening supervision of banks would "go a
long way to eliminate excessive risk-taking by insured
institutions."
   He expressed reservations about reducing the federal
insurance limit of $100,000 per account, another idea gaining
popularity. "If we were starting from scratch, the board
believes it would be difficult to make the case that
deposit-insurance coverage should be as high as its current
$100,000 level," he said.
   Nevertheless, banks, thrifts and millions of households
have made decisions assuming the $100,000 coverage, he said.
"Should Congress decide to lower deposit-insurance limits, a
meaningful transition period would be needed," he suggested.
   Mr. Greenspan also said that in the past "month or two"
banks may have "gone over the line" in restricting their
lending policies. Some banks have tightened lending standards
this year, mostly in commercial real-estate loans, leading to
widespread complaints of a credit squeeze. Mr. Greenspan had
been welcoming the increased prudence, and yesterday
maintained: "A substantial part of the pulling back is good,
not bad."
   Separately, Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.) introduced
legislation that would require the Fed to pay into the
bank-insurance fund interest on the $33 billion the industry
keeps in reserve at the Fed. The interest would provide
roughly $2.5 billion annually to the insurance fund, which
currently stands at $13.2 billion.

   TOKYO -- Japan's Big Four securities firms -- Nomura
Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co.
and Yamaichi Securities Co. -- drastically lowered pretax
earnings projections for the fiscal half year ending Sept.
30.
   Nomura, the world's largest securities firm, said its
pretax profit would drop 50%, to 125 billion yen ($905
million) in the first half of this year from 248.9 billion
yen in the like period last year. Daiwa said its pretax
profit would fall 62%, to about 65 billion yen from 171
billion. Nikko estimated its earnings would decline 73%, to
around 35 billion yen from 130.3 billion, and Yamaichi said
its profit would plunge 75%, to 30 billion yen from 117.9
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The projected profits are about a third of what the firms
previously had forecast.
   Pretax earnings are the clearest indication of the firms'
operating results.
   The sharp revisions underscore the damage to the industry
done by the steep reversals on the Tokyo Stock Exchange this
year. The harm to securities companies is broad. First-half
pretax profits for the 25 securities companies listed on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange are expected to fall an average of 50%,
according to a survey in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's
largest economic daily.
   Officials at the big Japanese securities houses cite
shrinking trading volume and deflated stock prices as the
main reasons for the declines. On average, two-thirds fewer
stocks are changing hands on the Tokyo exchange each day than
were traded at the end of last year. That bites deeply in
Tokyo because nearly half of securities industry revenue here
comes from equity brokerage commissions.
   Business isn't expected to pick up, either. For the full
year ending March 31, 1991, Nomura pretax profit is seen
falling 43% to 280 billion yen. Net income is predicted to
plummet 41% to 130 billion yen.

   GNP Drop Expected to Begin
   In 1990 Fourth Quarter,
   Last at Least Six Months

   LOS ANGELES -- The listless U.S. economy is already
slipping into a full-blown recession that will last for at
least six months, University of California at Los Angeles
business forecasters said.
   The UCLA Business Forecasting Project said it sees a
two-quarter decline in the nation's gross national product,
beginning in the fourth quarter. "Should the predicted
declines occur, it will likely be deemed that the recession
began before the fourth quarter because of the profound
weakness exhibited by the economy during the past few
months," said David G. Hensley, acting director of the
forecast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   UCLA forecasters at the Anderson Graduate School of
Management predict that real GNP will decline at an annual
rate of 2.4% in the fourth quarter and 3.2% in the first
quarter of 1991.
   The recession forecast is in line with that of many other
economists and forecasters. Blue Chip Economic Indicators
Inc., a Sedona, Ariz., firm that polls 50 economists each
month on their economic forecasts, said that 50% of
economists in a Sept. 10 poll predicted a recession that
would begin in the fourth quarter.
   The UCLA forecast is based on the assumption that a
diplomatic solution will be found to the Persian Gulf crisis.
Should a war begin, higher oil prices could deepen the
downturn, the economists said.
   The UCLA economists see a slow growth in consumer spending
in 1990, 1991 and 1992. Interest rates will begin to drop
this fall in response to the deteriorating economy, Mr.
Hensley said. By mid-1991, the federal funds rate will drop
below 6%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate banks
charge each other on overnight loans to meet the daily
reserve requirement.
   Racked by a softening real estate market and defense and
construction layoffs, California will join the national
economy in recession, Mr. Hensley said. "Although the
California economy is currently performing better than the
national economy, there are abundant signs that growth is
slowing," he added.
   Real gross state product for California is predicted to
grow 1.3% this year, followed by projected gains of 0.6% in
1991, 4.8% in 1992 and 2.1% in 1993, he said.
   The slide in California home construction continues, Mr.
Hensley said, with single-family housing starts currently off
33% from last fall. Home prices increases are expected to be
minimal through 1993, certainly below the rate of consumer
price inflation, he said.
   Meanwhile, construction and defense jobs will continue to
be cut, he said.

   Southland May Be Considering Seeking
   Chapter 11 Status, Thus Risking Bailout

   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. extended its debt-swap offer to
bondholders for the third time amid signs it is considering
filing for bankruptcy-court protection, which could
jeopardize a proposed $430 million bailout by its Japanese
partners.
   If the company seeks court protection -- a mark of
dishonor to Japanese businessmen -- Southland would put at
risk its agreement with Ito-Yokado, which operates the
company's 7-Eleven convenience stores in Japan. Ito-Yokado
has agreed to buy 70% of Southland if the company first
restructures its $1.8 billion of publicly traded debt. But
the company has got only partial approval from bondholders
for its debt-swap proposals, making it more likely that
Southland may have to file for Chapter 11 protection.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts in Japan couldn't recall an instance where a
Japanese retailer has acquired a company that filed a
bankruptcy petition. "Southland's in a bind," said Andy
Leinoff, an analyst in the Vermont office of McCarthy
Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc., a bond research firm. "The Japanese
seem to have an honorable aversion to bankruptcy."
   During the second extension, which ended Wednesday,
Southland made so little progress winning over bondholders
that observers say a pre-packaged bankruptcy-law filing --
wherein holdouts could lose their rights -- is the company's
only hope. At the end of the 18-day period, for instance,
only 49.8% of the company's 16.75%-interest notes had been
tendered, a gain of just 3.5 percentage points from the prior
extension.
   The company remains far short of the 95% approval in each
of five classes of bondholders it needs to complete the
Ito-Yokado bailout. In a pre-packaged filing, by contrast,
Southland would need only two-thirds approval. In a
successful pre-packaged proceeding, a company enters
bankruptcy court with a reorganization plan already drawn up
and approved by creditors representing two-thirds of its
debt. Holdouts are bound by court order to go along with the
plan.
   Nevertheless, in extending their offer 13 days, to Sept.
25, Southland officials reaffirmed their commitment to win
bondholder approval, and refused to discuss a bankruptcy-law
petition as an option.
   In Japan, Ito-Yokado officials extended their buy-out
offer, which was set to expire Sept. 15, to Sept. 25 to
coincide with the new deadline for Southland's debt-swap
offer. But a company spokesman declined to say whether the
company would extend the deadline any further. The spokesman
said he hadn't heard of any Southland proposal for a
pre-packaged filing.
   But the chairman of the Southland bondholder committee
said the company is already seeking Securities and Exchange
Commission approval of a bankruptcy reorganization plan. "The
main reason for this latest extension is that we want to get
well over the two-thirds approval level so that if we go this
pre-packaged bankruptcy route, we can do it quickly," said
John Gordon, president of Deltec Securities Corp. A
pre-packaged proceeding can be completed in a matter of
weeks.
   Mr. Gordon, who has been helping Southland woo holdouts,
said that SEC approval of the plan is expected late next
week. But he said he still hopes that a bankruptcy petition
won't be necessary. "Once bondholders who are taking a
show-me posture see these bankruptcy documents right in front
of their nose, maybe we won't have to do it," he said.
   But Southland still has a long way to go. When the latest
offer expired Wednesday, Southland had received tenders from
holders of 53.42% of its 18% notes, 65.27% of its 16.50%
notes, 67.65% of its 15.75% notes, and 92.67% of its 13.50%
notes. Only holders of the company's preferred stock exceeded
the minimum requirements of the deal, tendering 94.53% of the
shares outstanding. Only two-thirds approval of preferred
shareholders was required.
   "Over the past two weeks, we've succeeded in identifying
the vast majority of Southland security holders who have not
yet tendered their securities," said Clark Matthews, chief
financial officer. Now, he said, "we will intensify our
efforts to urge them to tender their securities."
   If Southland keeps falling short, one alternative to
seeking bankruptcy-law protection would be for Ito-Yokado to
lower its requirement that holders of 95% of all bonds
approve the deal. But that would make owning 70% of Southland
less attractive to Ito-Yokado, because high interest rates
would continue to be paid on the untendered bonds. In any
case, the Ito-Yokado spokesman said the company intended to
keep the 95% approval requirement.
   In Japan, analysts said that Southland's continuing
failure to reach an agreement with its bondholders was
discouraging investment in Ito-Yokado stock. Ito-Yokado
"won't continue to be so generous forever," said Takayuki
Suzuki, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. Although
Mr. Suzuki said it's unlikely the Japanese retailer would
back out of the offer, the company may toughen its position
before the fourth quarter ends.
   Southland, which owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other
convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went private in a
$4.9 billion leveraged buy-out in late 1987 to avoid a
threatened hostile takeover. But increased competition eroded
sales and profit margins and made it difficult for the
company to service the huge debt from the buy-out. That led
to the buy-out proposal, which would give Ito-Yokado a 70%
stake in Southland. Bondholders would retain 25% of the
company, while the founding Thompson family would get the
remaining 5%.
   Southland went into default on its $1.8 billion of
publicly traded debt in mid-July, but avoided being forced
into filing for bankruptcy-law protection when the bondholder
committee endorsed the terms of the current exchange offer,
the fourth proposed by the company.

   New Warrant
   Offers a Bet
   On Yen, Mark
   ----

   U.S. investors may soon get the chance to bet on the
relative currency values of two of the world's economic
powerhouses, Japan and Germany.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. yesterday filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission to register five million warrants
whose price over the next two years will rise if the yen
strengthens against the mark, and fall if it doesn't.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the warrants were designed by Goldman, they'll
officially be offered, as early as next week, by AT&amp;T Capital
Corp., a finance arm of the communications giant. Co-managers
of the offering are Oppenheimer &amp; Co. and Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   According to an options trader familiar with the terms of
the sophisticated new investment vehicle, this would be the
first cross-currency warrant offered in the U.S., though such
warrants have been sold in Europe. When issued, the warrants
are expected to be listed for trading on the American Stock
Exchange. Earlier this year, warrants on the Japanese stock
market were hits on the Amex.
   Most warrants, like options, give holders the right, but
not the obligation, to buy or sell securities, currencies and
other instruments at a specific price on or before a certain
date. But this warrant is more complicated, because while it
offers holders the opportunity to bet on the relative
strength of two foreign currencies, payoffs are made in
dollars.
   The value of the proposed warrants is based on the number
of yen it takes to buy one mark. This rate is computed by
dividing the number of yen it takes to buy $1 by the number
of marks required to buy $1. The Wall Street Journal daily
publishes a table of cross-rates between various currencies.
For example, the cross-rate yesterday was 86.879 yen to buy
one mark.
   The proposed warrants entitle an investor to a payment in
U.S. dollars if the number of yen to purchase one mark drops
below the number specified in the warrant, known as the
"strike price." This strike price will be the cross-rate
between the yen and the mark on the day the warrant is
issued. The intrinsic value of the warrant is calculated from
a formula specified in the warrant's prospectus. Each warrant
initially will represent $50 of currency and is expected to
be priced between $3.25 and $3.75.
   If the value of the yen appreciates relative to the mark
by 14% to about 74.72 yen for each mark, an investor would
double his money, assuming a warrant price of $3.50. Or, if
the yen were to strengthen against the dollar by 10% while
the mark stays at its current level vis-a-vis the dollar, an
investor would make about 42% on his warrants.
   Cross rates are just as volatile as currencies themselves.
As recently as the fall of 1989 the yen was under 75 yen per
mark, while in the first quarter of this year the ratio was
as high as 95 yen per mark.
   Of course, if the yen depreciates relative to the mark --
meaning the number of yen it takes to buy one mark increases
-- investors in these proposed warrants stand to lose all
their money at expiration. For example, if the yen drops to
150 yen to $1 while the mark-dollar rate remains steady --
yesterday it was 1.5677 marks to $1 -- the warrants would
expire worthless.
   These examples are based on the warrants' intrinsic value
and not on what buyers and sellers are willing to pay for the
warrants before expiration. The intrinsic value of the
warrants when they are issued will be zero. They will be
priced on the basis of their so-called time value, which will
be the issue price of around $3.50. As a warrant approaches
expiration, it loses its time value and its price begins to
approach its intrinsic value.
   Like the warrants based on the Nikkei stock average that
were sold so successfully earlier this year, purchasers will
not have to wait until expiration to exercise their warrants.
"American-style" warrants can be exercised on any business
day. Holders of warrants also will be able to sell them on
the Amex.
   Original purchasers of warrants that were bets the Nikkei
stock average would fall reaped tremendous profits; the first
issue of them came out just as Nikkei average was reaching
its peak. Even purchasers of the second set of warrants have
done well as they were issued when the Nikkei was around
28,000. Currently, it is near 25,000.

   Where would you invest $100,000 in these troubled times?
   Let's ask a few investment professionals who have won the
respect of their fellow money managers and investment
strategists. Where's the best place to put the dough,
assuming that it is fresh cash and that the $100,000 won't be
needed for a few years?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As might be expected, many of the pros suggest that
investors go lighter than usual on stocks. But none would
avoid the stock market, which is down 13% from mid-July. Even
the most bearish of the bunch would put $25,000 into stocks.
   Here's a rundown of where nine pros would advise an
individual to invest $100,000 today. The pros aren't
infallible, of course. Some of them missed the mark in a
similar survey last December by praising growth stocks and
scoffing at recession fears.
                                                                                                       

   NED DAVIS would put half the money, or $50,000, into
stocks. A Nakomis, Fla., investment adviser who is widely
followed by other pros, Mr. Davis would funnel $30,000 of the
rest into 10-year Treasury notes and $20,000 into Treasury
bills.
   In Mr. Davis's view, stock prices already reflect most of
the bad news about the Mideast conflict, the U.S. budget
deficit and the thrift crisis: "The data indicates that we're
not falling off a cliff."
   Small investors should quit worrying so much about Iraq,
he says. Wars are "stimulative to the economy and the stock
market . . . You can go back and look at how the market has
reacted to every international crisis since the fall of
France, and in three-quarters of the cases, stocks do better
after the crisis."
   Mr. Davis is a "market timer," using hundreds of economic
and technical market indicators to discern when to jump in or
out of the stock market. Although stocks hit a bottom Aug.
23, he isn't convinced that a strong upturn is under way.
"Major bull markets need a sold-out condition, deep pessimism
and an accommodative Federal Reserve before they begin," he
says. And stocks now are "reasonably priced."
                                                                                                       

   JOHN M. TEMPLETON, 77-year-old chairman of the Templeton
Group of Mutual Funds, would put $75,000 into stocks.
   "If you wait until there are no problems, you will never
make an investment," he says from his Bahamas home. "The wise
time to buy shares is at the point of maximum worry. That is
the time you get shares at bargain prices."
   Mr. Templeton suggests putting the $75,000 into
small-company stocks with rapidly growing earnings in the
U.S., United Kingdom and Canada. "Emerging growth stocks
haven't been popular for seven years, so this is where the
bargains are," he says. He would put the other $25,000 into
long-term U.S. government bonds.
   The Iraq crisis is probably fully reflected in stock
prices, Mr. Templeton says. Since World War II, "we have had
eight bear markets, seven recessions, wars, inflation and
many more severe political problems than this Kuwait matter."
                                                                                                       

   MARSHALL FRONT -- "Hysteria has swept Wall Street," says
the executive vice president at Stein Roe &amp; Farnum Inc.,
Chicago, which manages $20 billion. "Strong companies are
being thrown out of portfolios willy-nilly. We'll look back
on this as an awfully good buying opportunity in two or three
years."
   Historically, when pessimism reigns, it has been a good
time to begin accumulating quality stocks that have been
beaten down, he says. Mr. Front would put $50,000 into such
stocks as Motorola, Fluor, Waste Management, General Electric
and Procter &amp; Gamble.
   "While it's hard to gauge how long the decline will last,
the world is not going to come to an end," he says. Many
companies will have good earnings in a modest recession. "You
hear horror stories about bank failures, $50-a-barrel oil
prices . . . all these things are being magnified in
importance. And investors are jumping to the worst
conclusions."
   Mr. Front would put $25,000 in short-term government
bonds. Another $25,000 would go into a money market fund as a
reserve for future stock purchases "on a further market dip
or if the Mideast crisis is resolved."
                                                                                                       

   MICHAEL METZ -- The chief investment strategist at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. believes it would be a mistake to invest
the $100,000 portfolio at one time. He would move in phases.
First, he would put $25,000 into intermediate-term government
bonds and $25,000 into publicly traded German, French and
Italian stock funds, specifically the funds trading at the
biggest discounts to their portfolio value.
   He would put the rest in a money market fund. After three
months he would invest $25,000 in small-stock closed-end
funds, perhaps doubling this investment six months later. His
goal: "a diversified collection of bargains."
   If war breaks out in the Middle East, Mr. Metz suggests
that investors buy stocks "at that crack in the market. You
have to go contrary to sentiment," he says. "When you feel
like throwing up, it's time to buy."
                                                                                                       

   CHARLES CLOUGH -- The chief investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. would put $45,000 in "utilities, health
care, natural gas and technology stocks," avoiding the big
consumer stocks such as Walt Disney and Wal-Mart Stores. He
would also put $45,000 in 10- to 15-year government bonds,
and the rest in a money market fund.
   Stocks will have a difficult year, Mr. Clough says. But
some of the downside has been alleviated with the recent
slump in prices.
                                                                                                       

   STEVEN LEUTHOLD -- A number of pros are sharply
underweighting their usual stock positions. One of them is
Mr. Leuthold, president of Leuthold Group, a Minneapolis
company that provides research for institutional investors.
He would put only $30,000 into stocks because of concern
about the weakening dollar and the huge U.S. debt.
   "The market has another 10% to 15% farther to fall," Mr.
Leuthold says. He would spend the $30,000 on stocks with a
heavy emphasis on pollution control, and battered growth
stocks.
   Meanwhile, he would invest $50,000 in bonds, with $40,000
split between intermediate and long-term U.S. government
bonds and $10,000 in West German bonds. He likes the West
German bonds because they offer an "unusually high" 9%
interest rate and give some protection against a weakening
U.S. dollar. He would put the final $20,000 into a money
market fund to use when stock prices decline further.
                                                                                                       

   LARRY BIEHL -- Interest rates are headed downward,
according to Mr. Biehl, a partner in the San Mateo, Calif.,
money management firm of Bailard, Biehl &amp; Kaiser. Hence, he
suggests investing $50,000 in 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds.
"If you are a fear person or an opportunist, the long bond is
where you'll make your money," he says. The 30-year U.S. bond
now yields more than 8.9%.
   Mr. Biehl says the U.S. is in a "slowdown/recession" that
could drag on for 12 to 18 months. He says investors can sit
out the recession with a "decent yield" as they wait for the
economy to revive.
   Because he expects corporate earnings to continue to erode
in the recession, he would put only $15,000 in drug shares
and other recession-resistant U.S. stocks, $10,000 in
international stocks, $10,000 in real estate trusts and
$15,000 in a money market fund.
                                                                                                       

   MARY FARRELL -- Several pros advise that individuals buy
blue-chip stocks, many of which have been beaten down in the
sell-off. "This may not be the bottom but these are good
prices for good growth companies," says Mary Farrell,
investment strategist at PaineWebber Inc.
   In this vein, another pro, Mr. Davis, suggests Boeing,
International Business Machines, GE, Coca-Cola Co. and
PepsiCo, all multinational companies that can take advantage
of the weak U.S. dollar.
                                                                                                       

   ARNOLD KAUFMAN -- The editor of Standard &amp; Poor's Outlook,
says: "This is no time to be a hero." He would put $40,000 of
the portfolio into two- to 10-year Treasury notes yielding
between 8% and 9%. And he would funnel only $25,000 into
stocks now.

   Developing Nations Seem Most Hurt
   By Oil-Price Surge Tied to Iraq's Acts

   WASHINGTON -- Saddam Hussein's offer of free oil to
developing countries, provided they come and get it, shows
that he understands whose economies he has hurt the most.
   The Iraqi president's strong-arm tactics in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, his Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent United Nations embargo
against Iraq have caused oil prices to rise above $30 a
barrel, a 50% increase from prices early in the year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Those who are most pressed by these higher prices are
oil-importing developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe that are struggling to reform
their economies -- nations such as Zambia, Bangladesh,
Brazil, Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   In addition, more-expensive oil is expected to slow growth
in industrialized countries and push up interest rates and
inflation rates. That means developing countries will suffer
from weaker markets for their exports and more-difficult
market conditions for borrowing money.
   As the World Bank says in a preliminary analysis of the
impact of higher oil prices, "the majority of developing
countries . . . will find it difficult to raise the
additional resources to meet the higher cost of oil imports
and larger interest payments on their variable-rate external
debt." The agency also worries that greater economic hardship
"could undermine public acceptance" of economic reform
programs.
   While the recent increase in prices isn't nearly as large
as those of 1974 and 1979, developing countries aren't as
well-positioned as the industrialized nations to deal with
it. The World Bank says developing countries now account for
28% of world oil consumption, a substantial 55% increase from
the oil shock days of 1973, when they accounted for only 18%.
   Of course, not all developing countries are being hurt.
Some oil-producing developing countries, such as Mexico,
Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela, will benefit from higher
oil prices.
   Some Western analysts say it is time to call Saddam
Hussein's bluff on the free oil: "We should say, excellent,
send in ships and distribute the free oil to poor countries,"
says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.'s
international unit. "He's the guy who put the prices up in
the first place."
   Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
are now preparing detailed studies of the effect of higher
oil prices on developing countries that they expect to
outline at the time of their annual meetings here beginning
next Thursday. They also are re-examining their programs to
sort out what they can do to ease adjustment, but in general
they don't plan new loan mechanisms.
   A senior U.S. Treasury official recently indicated that
borrowing nations probably will be offered enlarged access to
IMF credits. There will be more-extensive use of the IMF's
so-called compensatory financing, which allows nations to
borrow to insulate themselves against sudden external shocks.
Those hurt by higher oil prices, lower remittances from
citizens who used to work in Iraq and Kuwait, and even the
loss of canal and pipeline fees, should be able to take
advantage of this.
   The World Bank may find ways to accelerate its existing
loan disbursements to developing countries to ease the impact
of the Persian Gulf crisis, Alex Shakow, the agency's
director of external affairs, said Wednesday. But, agency
officials say, such steps will be considered later this month
at a Group of Seven ministerial meeting, and at the World
Bank and IMF annual meetings. The G-7 is made up of the
finance ministers and central bank governors of the U.S.,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   The Asian tigers -- the fast-growing East Asian economies
of Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong -- are almost
totally dependent on imported oil, and the World Bank's vice
president for Asia, Attila Karaosmanoglu, estimated recently
that they could suffer an added import cost of as much as 1%
of their gross domestic product. But these nations also are
likely to be "the fastest and most pragmatic adjusters," he
said.
   In Eastern Europe, struggling reformers probably would
sustain a reduction of as much as one percentage point in the
growth of gross domestic product because of higher oil
prices, according to studies conducted the past month that
assume a price of $25 a barrel. Higher oil prices also
probably spell a setback for environmental cleanup programs,
as the East Europeans will be more reluctant to give up
burning cheap locally mined brown coal, which is a severe
pollutant.
   For some developing nations the effect of the Kuwait
crisis is indirect through the loss of workers' remittances.
Egypt, for example, stands to benefit from higher oil prices,
but lost worker remittances will more than offset that. There
were one million Egyptians working in Kuwait, Iraq and the
surrounding area. Jordan, Bangladesh and Pakistan also are
particularly badly affected by the loss of remittance income.
Meantime, Turkey loses the profits it garnered from the trade
and transport of goods to Iraq and Kuwait.

   JPS Textile Cancels
   Its Offers to Buy
   Its Notes, Preferred

   NEW YORK -- JPS Textile Group Inc., after numerous failed
attempts to persuade bondholders, said it terminated its
offers to buy and exchange about $450 million of its notes
and preferred.
   The company, which initiated the offers July 20 and had
extended them to Sept. 20, said it would be "impracticable"
to continue the offers because a majority of the debt holders
"do not favor them."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest setback for the debt-ridden textile concern
signals a growing reluctance of bondholders to refinance debt
on terms available in today's deflated markets.
   The company said yesterday that "financial alternatives to
the offers are being explored," including the possibility of
exchanging equity in the company for the notes and shares.
   The action comes only a week after JPS extended its offer
for the seventh time, sweetening the offer for some notes and
shares. But few bondholders were swayed, and many instead
sought exchange offers in which interest rates on the debt
securities would be reduced in exchange for newly issued
equity. "Discussions with representatives of the debt holders
are expected to continue," JPS said.
   JPS had hoped to use the proceeds to repay debt that it
incurred when it acquired J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., a maker of
textiles and related products, for $579 million in 1988. JPS
sold the notes and shares to help finance the acquisition.
   The company was offering, for each $1,000 principal amount
of its notes outstanding, $850 for the senior notes; $190.22
and 1.7 JPS common shares for discount notes; and $400 plus
1.45 JPS shares for subordinated notes. JPS also offered to
exchange $1,000 principal amount of its 6% debentures and
1.21 JPS shares for each $1,000 principal amount of its
subordinated debt outstanding. In addition, the company was
offering $10 for each preferred Series A share.
   The company said that although about $1.6 million
principal amount of senior notes outstanding had been
tendered as of Sept. 6, no other securities had been
tendered.

   Market Resumes Decline as Budget Talks
   Stall; Conner Peripherals Off 1 5/8 to 20 5/8

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks accelerated their
decline as the market pondered a recessionary economy without
a federal budget agreement in sight.
   While equity market indexes dropped ahead of today's
producer price, retail sales and industrial production data,
the markets absorbed more bad news in the form of Iraqi
threats of terrorist actions against U.S. targets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The skittish stock markets have been predisposed to
decline at every hint of bad news since Iraq invaded Kuwait
six weeks ago. No budget agreement yesterday was just what
stock prices didn't need.
   "Stock prices were eroding as it was. When there was talk
of no budget, it just pulled the floor out," says Philip
Benizzi, head of OTC trading for Dillon Read &amp; Co.
   The fact that volume remains near its lowest levels of the
year only seemed to exaggerate the decline.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 4.14 points, or 1.09%, to
376.18. Volume edged up to 105.7 million shares from
Wednesday's 98.5 million shares. There were 1,105 declining
issues while 672 advanced.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the situation was much the
same. The Big Board's composite index also fell 1.09%,
closing at 175.16, down 1.93. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average lost 43.07, or 1.64%, to close at 2,582.67
   "It doesn't mean anything," Interstate-Johnson Lane's
Senior Vice President for OTC trading Nelson Gold says of
yesterday's tumbling market.
   Mr. Gold says the market is merely drifting amid
cross-currents from budget negotiators, the Middle East, the
Federal Reserve and the economy. Until the Persian Gulf
situation is resolved, a budget is in place and the Fed eases
credit, Mr. Gold says, the market will meander.
   "People are just doing the minimum they have to do," he
says.
   The absence of investor conviction probably is hurting
small stocks worst, says Jonathan Raclin, executive vice
president in charge of sales, trading and research for
Chicago Corp.
   Investors "are saying `we like small stocks,'" Mr. Raclin
says. "But they're saying `call me when they're cheaper.'"
   Investors interpreted bad news out of Japan as a sell
signal for the most active OTC issue, Conner Peripherals.
   Toshiba announced it had developed a 2.5-inch micro hard
disk drive that could compete with Conner Peripherals
products. Trading 4.1 million shares, Conner Peripherals fell
1 5/8 to 20 5/8. Some analysts say the sell-off was an
overreaction.
   Also on the active list, Tele-Communications Class A
shares were unchanged at 10 7/8; Oracle Systems fell 3/8 to 7
7/8; Amgen added 1/2 to 48 1/2; Apple Computer lost 1/4 to 33
3/4.
   Teradata fell 2 to 17 1/2. The company encouraged analysts
yesterday morning not to overestimate its earnings. Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said Prudential-Bache Securities
lowered its 25 cents a share earnings estimate for Teradata's
first quarter. For the quarter a year ago, Teradata had net
income of 17 cents a share including three cents a share from
tax benefits.
   Sizzler Restaurants International rebounded from a 1 1/4
point loss Wednesday. Sizzler shares lost ground when Collins
Foods International said it would begin an exchange offer for
the 34% of Sizzler it does not already own. Analysts
suggested yesterday that the market may have undervalued the
future prospects for Sizzler and Collins. Sizzler shares
gained 1/2 to close at 15 3/4.
   Immunex fell 1 1/2 to 27 7/8. DJPIR reported the Food and
Drug Administration has delayed a decision on Immunex's GMCSF
drug, a genetically engineered white-blood-cell stimulant
used in some bone marrow transplants.
   Applied Biosystems was unchanged at 8 1/4. The company
said it expects to charge $5 million against first quarter
earnings for costs associated with relocating its liquid
chromatography components operations from New Jersey to
California.
   Neworld Bancorp said it expects to report a loss of about
$10 million, or $2.50 a share, for its third quarter compared
to net income of $1.4 million, or 35 cents a share, a year
ago. Neworld attributed the anticipated loss to a $15 million
addition to possible loan loss reserve. Its shares dropped
3/8 to 4.
   Groundwater Technology added 3/4 to 18 3/4. The company
said it has been repurchasing its shares in the past month.
   Telxon was up 7/8 to 10 7/8. Telxon projected fiscal
second quarter operating profit of 20 cents a share compared
with a net loss of 30 cents a share in the quarter a year
ago.
   Lancaster Colony dropped 1 3/4 to 16 3/4 after revealing
late Wednesday that fourth quarter earnings dropped to five
cents a share from 52 cents a share in the quarter last year.
Lancaster said most of the decline was related to charges
associated with certain litigation.
   In-Store Advertising plunged another 1 1/4 to 4 1/2. The
stock went public two months ago at $19 a share.
   Kentucky Medical Insurance dropped another 1 1/4 to 12
after falling 1 3/4 Wednesday. Yesterday's closing price
marks a new 52-week low for Kentucky Medical Insurance.

   It probably was inevitable that as soon as someone started
to talk about creating a new world order, the demagogues
would come out of the woodwork. They could be heard around
the U.S. Capitol this week as Congressmen rained down
denunciations on Japan and Germany for not pulling their
weight in the Gulf. "History has shown that we need to be
tough to get action from Japan," thundered exdove Rep. David
Bonior of Michigan. With Saddam Hussein still fat and sassy
in Baghdad, this may not be the best time for some of the
West's major powers to go off into an alley for a fistfight.
   There is indeed a case to be made that Japan and
especially Germany should be doing more to support the Gulf
intervention. It would be helpful, though, if all the engaged
parties brought more sophistication to the question of the
Japanese-German contribution than was on display in the House
this week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For instance, the arguments over what kind of help Japan
should send, and how much, bring us closer to the day when
the world must face the rebirth of Japan as a leading
military power. Even with its defense budget held just under
1% of gross national product, Japan already ranks among the
world's top five nations in defense spending. Still, there
are people beyond the Beltway -- including Asians who recall
Japan's behavior in World War II -- who harbor misgivings
about a more military-minded Japan. Since that time, of
course, the Japanese have been learning better ways of
integrating themselves into the world.
   Japan's awesome productivity has provided cars, stereos,
televisions, watches, computers and cameras that people
world-wide have flocked to buy. Japan now is opening, even if
slowly, to imports, out of a belated recognition that its
workers are entitled to more fruits of their labor. Far more
Japanese are traveling abroad, thereby becoming more
cosmopolitan in their outlook.
   Moreover, the challenges these past few years to the
long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party suggest that the
democratic process is starting to seriously permeate Japanese
society. The electorate is fed up with unresponsive LDP
leaders who bulldozed through an unpopular consumption tax
and whose protectionist policies have served a few special
interests at the expense of consumers.
   Japan, in short, has been evolving toward a society open
and flexible enough to know the full value of safeguarding
the democratic order. The big question is whether Japan has
already reached the point at which its allies, and its own
citizens, can trust it to stand strictly by the guns of
democracy. Perhaps. What's clear is that Japan has for a long
time been moving in the right direction.
   The trick is to encourage that movement, including a
greater Gulf commitment, without driving them back into a
shell. For the moment, Japan's Prime Minister Kaifu has
offered a Persian Gulf aid package worth some $1 billion.
Yesterday Japan's Justice Minister supported a review of the
country's constitution to allow sending non-combat troops to
the Gulf, while another member of the Kaifu cabinet stated
that, "We have a large role to play in restoring peace in the
Gulf . . . and we should take up our responsibilities."
   The situation with the Germans is in some ways more
troublesome. Over the past several years, Germany practically
developed a for-profit foreign policy; while the government
was busy with other things, many German firms developed
intimate relations with Saddam Hussein. The German government
is investigating 60 companies suspected of making
weapons-related sales to Baghdad. West German firms are said
to have been in the forefront of Iraq's development of poison
gas capabilities. And this came after a scandal in which
German firms stood accused of supplying Libyan chemical
plants.
   Last weekend Helmut Kohl acknowledged that other nations
could say of Germany, "If there is money to be made, they're
there, but if the issue is taking responsibility, they evade
it." Yesterday Mr. Kohl called it "impossible" for a newly
united Germany to remain uninvolved, and tomorrow Secretary
of State Baker will meet with the German President to discuss
this matter.
   What we are seeing here is a process of awakening. Just as
Germany was able to recognize and seize the momentum of
history in German reunification, the coalition arrayed
against Iraq's international piracy represents another
turning point in the world's accelerating transformation.
With so much at stake, it is important to push back against
the sort of potentially destructive demagoguery on display in
Congress this week, but it also is essential for Germany and
Japan to recognize that an event is occurring in which both
should be important participants.

Pennsylvania Medical Center said they "permanently reversed"
diabetes in 10 of 13 laboratory rats by transplanting
insulin-producing cells into the thymus gland of the animals.
   The novel approach of using the thymus as the transplant
site could have promising implications for treatment of
insulin-dependent diabetes in humans, which occurs early in
life. If developed further and adapted successfully, it also
could contribute to more effective transplantation of other
human organs, such as hearts, livers and kidneys.

   Insulin, which the body needs to metabolize sugar, is
produced by clumps of islet cells in the pancreas that
resemble raisins in bread. In insulin-dependent diabetics,
these indigenous cells have been singled out, attacked and
destroyed by a process that still isn't fully understood.
   Diabetes is a killer disease. Its life-threatening
complications include heart attack, stroke, kidney failure
and peripheral vascular disease. It's also a leading cause of
blindness. About one million of the 12 million Americans who
are diabetic have insulin dependency. The others suffer from
a different and less severe kind of disorder, and there isn't
any indication that the transplant technique developed at
Penn would apply to their treatment.
   The Penn experiments, described in today's issue of
Science magazine, used laboratory rats that weren't diabetic
by heredity. Instead, the researchers induced diabetes
intravenously two or three weeks before transplantation.
Survival of transplanted islet cells for 100 days would be
considered "permanent" reversal of diabetes. At Penn, the
islets survived for 200 days before most of the animals were
killed to permit further tests. A few rats continued to
produce insulin for 18 months.
   Paul Lacy, a recognized pioneer in islet transplantation
at Washington University in St. Louis, said he thinks the
Penn results are "extremely interesting," but much work
remains to be done. "The next question," Dr. Lacy said, "is
what will happen when they do this in BB rats," which are
genetically bred to be diabetic. The procedure also would
have to be tested in dogs or monkeys before any program for
humans could be undertaken, he said.
   For more than a decade, diabetes researchers have used the
liver, kidney and spleen as islet-transplant sites. But in
these previous experiments, conducted at Penn and several
other institutions, the transplanted cells were almost always
rejected within days unless shielded by heavy doses of
immunosuppressive drugs.
   The Penn researchers, led by surgery Prof. Ali Naji,
believe they are the first to transplant islet cells into the
thymus. Only a single dose of an immunosuppressant was used.
Dr. Naji said he and his team chose the thymus because they
suspected the ductless gland to be a "privileged" transplant
site that is "protected" from the body's usual process for
rejecting foreign tissue.
   The role of the thymus is still not fully understood, but
it may contribute to the body's defenses in early years. The
Penn experiments suggest that the thymus, unlike the liver or
the kidney, doesn't set off loud alarms that summon the
body's natural defense mechanisms to attack transplanted
cells. As a result, the study concludes, using the thymus can
reduce sharply the need for immunosuppressive drugs that can
cause life-threatening side effects, such as cancer or
infection.
   Perhaps more important, the tests indicate that
transplants into the thymus can help prevent rejection of
later transplants elsewhere in the body. After 200 days, the
team transplanted new islet cells into the kidneys of some
animals. By that point, the immune system didn't recognize
the new islets as foreign tissue. "The cells weren't
rejected," said Andrew M. Posselt, an author of the study,
"even though they were outside the protective environment of
the thymus."
   Clyde F. Barker, Penn's chief of surgery and an author of
the study, said the thymus technique could prove important
"as a prelude to other kinds of transplants" that someday may
be done "safely with very little immunosuppression or none at
all."
   Dr. Naji said the next phase of the project will be to
test the transplant procedure on animals that are diabetic by
heredity. That way, the researchers can determine if the
thymus also provides an effective sanctuary against the
mechanism that attacks and destroys indigenous islet cells in
the pancreas.
   The human thymus, lodged in the upper chest cavity, is
prominent at puberty but shrinks as the body ages. Its
reduced size might present some challenges, but Dr. Naji said
he thinks the thymus is probably still "less inconvenient"
for transplantation than the body's other privileged sites,
which include the brain, the eye and the testicle.
   The Penn study is the second diabetes-related discovery to
be announced this week. In Nature magazine, researchers at
Yale University and the University of California at San
Francisco identified a protein that plays a key role in the
development of insulin-dependent diabetes, thus raising the
prospect of screening to find young people who are at risk
years before onset of the disease.

   L.A. Fetes the Pacific Rim

   Los Angeles -- The 1990 Los Angeles Festival was doomed to
be political from the start: "We looked for the most overtly
political and most overtly spiritual work we thought we could
get away with presenting," said associate director Norman
Frisch. Festival director Peter Sellars was determined to
break away from European-based art forms, like those that had
so dazzled visitors at the last two festivals, in 1984 and
1987. He promised to pay more respect to California's rich
new ethnic mix, and help us all to sail out on a great rising
wave of New Age spiritualism, by inviting exclusively
non-European-based, preferably aboriginal, artists from
countries of what is now ominously called the Pacific Rim.
   Major live performances at the festival -- if one may be
permitted that elitist distinction -- were held not at public
parks but at scattered formal arenas, most of them small, for
which admission (as much as $40) was charged. In the 16 days
of the festival, one might see a dozen such ticketed events;
over Labor Day weekend, I saw three. The incomparable court
performers from the Yogyakarta Palace in Java -- now
traveling elsewhere in the U.S. -- are as disciplined, as
out-and-out beautiful a dance and music group as I have ever
seen. "Legend of the Water Flame" -- also touring to New York
-- is a short, stark, high-intensity modernist creation by
several Japanese living cultural treasures, transcendentally
performed by flutist Michiko Akao, actress Kayoko Shiraishi
and percussionist Yasunori Yamaguchi. I also caught the
latest (1987+) offering of New York's avant-avant-garde
Wooster Group -- not quite Pacific Rim, but good friends of
Mr. Sellars, who gave them the idea for the show in the first
place. In it, they superimpose texts, flesh, media and
theatrical styles on a dark, messy high-tech set, in a way
that intentionally and intensely makes no sense at all.
Complex, tautly controlled and largely unintelligible, of and
for the elect, events like these stand at an opposite pole
from the populist, accessible (and free) folk/ethnic
performances that were the festival's primary raison d'etre.

<TEXT>
   The opening ceremonies on Saturday, arranged as a kind of
multitribal religious ritual, were held below a giant Korean
bell hung in a temple-pavilion at Angels Gate Park, which
dramatically overlooks the Theme Ocean. (At the end, the bell
was rung seven times, for the four points of the compass,
Mother Earth, Father Sky and the Spirit Within. Agnostics
weren't sure how to respond.) We were first blessed and
welcomed by representatives of local Indian tribes, the
people, we were reminded, on whose turf we were all sitting.
There followed long, awkward introductions and short, sharp
performances by troupes from Alaska, Hawaii, Australia, New
Zealand, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Bali and the Wallis and Futuna
Islands, a French territory of some 13,000 people between
Fiji and Samoa probably best known to stamp collectors, whose
jovial singer/dancers became one of the great hits of the
festival. Later in the sunburnt afternoon, wandering among
five stages and an outdoor market set up near the ocean, I
watched a warrior-macho hula, Japanese Taiko drummers, and
the compelling Wallis and Futunese, a dozen husky men in
tapa-cloth kilts who sat in a circle and sang on and on
(betimes sipping kava-root liquor), in a kind of close, high,
penetrating Kentucky mountain harmony.
   After an overpacked 10 a.m. mass Sunday at the church
where L.A. began (Nuestra Senora Reina de los Angeles, whose
feast day we were celebrating), male dancers from Oaxaca in
Mexico and the Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico performed in the
patio alongside the church for perhaps 200 people. The
trumpets of a local high school's mariachi band rang out from
the plaza across the street. Depending on a minimalist, in
the end hypnotizing series of quicksteps, kicks, kneebends
and turns, and the repetitive rhythm of drums and a pipe (for
the Mexicans), electric violin and guitar (the Pueblo
Indians), the two formal, imperfect, expressionless troupes
communicated primarily through bare feet or shifting
boot-tips, a few stately or comic ritual gestures, and vivid
costumes. The men from Jemez Pueblo, in fact, were the most
gorgeously and elaborately garbed performers of the week,
each dancer weighed down and half-blinded by a different
array of turquoise, gold, silks, lace, fringe, feathers and
dime-store glitter.
   Some of the happiest moments in my thin slice of the L.A.
Festival (the publicists of which claim a grand total of
1,400 participating artists, from 25 countries, at 96
different sites) came through the sort of fortuitous cultural
clashes one encounters in Los Angeles any day of the year. As
the Korean Shamans at San Pedro were doing their weird thing
in white robes and black peaked Pilgrim hats, to wild and
wailing music that could have passed for cutting-edge
European, a little airplane flew past trailing an ad-banner
for Pure Rock, KNAC-105. Along with body paint and grass
skirts, some Maori dancers wore Sony Walkmans, perhaps tuned
to KNAC. I contrived a minifestival of my own cruising along
the many freeways, by switching from KNAC Pure Rock, to
arcane classical on KUSC, to KZLA (93.9), the best
country-western station I've ever found. On Sunday morning,
en route to my Spanish mass, I had the good fortune to come
across the live gospel choir of Second Baptist.
   To the opening ceremonies at San Pedro, Peter Sellars
wore, with his white tennies and Bart Simpson haircut, what
looked like an electric-gold and black clown suit. In fact,
it was a native outfit of baggy pants and belted tunic he had
bought that morning at the African Marketplace, one of the
many festival venues listed on the program.
   So on my way to LAX Monday morning, I drove to a large,
flat city park in the middle of a lively black neighborhood.
There I spent three happy hours at the one event of the 1990
L.A. Festival that came close to realizing the idealistic
pretensions of its creators. Under a near-African sun, a few
shady trees and palm-roofed pavilions, thousands of genuinely
festive locals strolled along haystrewn paths among more than
200 bazaar stalls. On five separate stages through the fair,
gospel, blues, jazz, steel drum, rap, reggae and Afro-Latin
musicians, poets, storytellers and African dancers performed,
the sound of one overlapping the sound of another in jolly
polyrhythm. But except for the fact that two of the some 120
groups performing on those stages (the Maori and Wallis and
Futuna troupes) were there on loan from the festival
authorities, the African Marketplace has in fact nothing to
do with the L.A. Festival's multicultural, semiglobal
designs. An annual event of and for the black community --
although all comers are made welcome -- it has been going
strong for five years.
   (Highlights of this, the festival's final weekend, include
Vermont's Bread and Puppet Theater; Chile's El Gran Circo
Teatro; the Cambodian Classical Dance Troupe; a four-church
gospel choir; a mass Japanese street dance; and John Adams's
opera "Nixon in China," directed by the ubiquitous Mr.
Sellars.)

   CBOT Is Sued
   By Ferruzzi Firm
   In Soybean Case

   CHICAGO -- Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. filed suit in U.S.
District Court here, alleging the Chicago Board of Trade
violated antitrust laws and the Commodity Exchange Act when
it issued a 1989 emergency order requiring soybean traders to
close out their positions.
   The CBOT's action last year was designed to avert a
possible squeeze on traders holding short, or selling,
positions in the contracts, where prices had skyrocketed in
response to a drought-reduced soybean harvest. Ferruzzi, a
grain merchant, had accumulated large quantities of soybeans
and long, or purchase, contracts; liquidating that position
under the order gave the Milan concern significant trading
losses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In one suit, Ferruzzi alleges that "certain members of the
CBOT's board of directors, including its chairman, were
affiliated with trading firms that held short soybean futures
positions in proprietary or customer accounts." The board
issued the order in an effort to avoid losses by
"manipulating soybean prices to artificially low levels."
   The CBOT chairman at the time the order was issued was
Karsten Mahlmann, who was also chairman of Stotler Group Inc.
Stotler held a short position, as did its customers, the suit
alleges. And because of the firm's "dire financial straits"
at the time, a loss on its position, or a customer default,
"might have forced the company into default, which in fact
happened a year later." As reported, Mr. Mahlmann resigned
from the CBOT after Stotler collapsed earlier this summer;
the company's financial woes weren't publicly known until
July of this year.
   In a separate suit, Ferruzzi asked the court to block a
disciplinary procedure scheduled for next week, in which the
CBOT's Business Conduct Committee will decide on charges that
Ferruzzi's marketplace activities were designed to manipulate
the price of soybean contracts. Ferruzzi's suit alleges that
the CBOT launched the internal investigation "in response to
the criticism of its apparent conflict of interest."
   The Business Conduct Committee, which will hear the
charges against Ferruzzi, "is the same body which recommended
the emergency order, decided to initiate an investigation of
plaintiffs, and approved the charges against them," the suit
says. And if it wants to appeal the committee's ruling,
Ferruzzi said, it has to appeal to the CBOT's board, which
"approved and issued the emergency order."
   The disciplinary procedures should be blocked because the
CBOT "is incapable of providing (Ferruzzi) with a fair
hearing."
   In both suits, only the CBOT is named as a defendant.
   Both the Commodities Futures Trading Commision and the
General Accounting Office carried out investigations of the
CBOT's emergency order, and concluded there hadn't been a
conflict of interest.
   In a statement yesterday, the CBOT called the suits
"obviously frivolous," and added that it intends to resist
them "to the fullest extent of the law. . . . We will not
permit them to interfere with our responsibility to protect
the integrity of the market through our disciplinary
process."

   Ford Motor's Canadian Unit Is Facing
   Walkout at Midnight in Contract Talks

   TORONTO -- Almost 13,000 employees at Ford Motor Co.'s
Canadian subsidiary were slated to strike at midnight, as
time appeared to be running out for a new contract
settlement.
   Officials of the Canadian Auto Workers union were
continuing to meet with Ford officials last night, but union
insiders asserted that there wasn't any chance a new contract
could be put together before the strike deadline. A Ford
spokesman was more upbeat, but said reaching any agreement at
this point would require "damn hard work."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A walkout by Ford's Canadian employees would idle nine of
the company's plants in Canada. It also could hurt important
Ford operations in the U.S., which depend on parts
manufactured in Canada. Ford officials predict a shortage of
engines and auto glass from Canada would result in several
U.S. operations closing within two weeks of a strike.
   The union began contract negotiations last week after
selecting Ford as a strike target. Under the usual system of
pattern bargaining, any contract reached at Ford will serve
as the basis for subsequent negotiations with the Canadian
subsidiaries of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
Current contracts at each of the Big Three auto makers, which
cover a total of 61,000 employees in Canada, expire today.
   Ford has made just one contract offer since the talks
began. That offer, covering such economic issues as wages,
vacations and cost-of-living allowances, was swiftly rejected
by the union, which contended that the company wasn't
offering nearly enough money. Even if Ford should return
before the strike deadline with a mutually acceptable package
of economic terms, there remain such time-consuming issues to
be resolved as health and safety in the plants and medical
benefits.
   A Canadian strike would hit some of Ford's most profitable
model lines. The company's St. Thomas, Ontario, plant is the
sole source for the large Mercury Grand Marquis and Ford
Crown Victoria models.
   Ford's Windsor, Ontario, engine plant builds the
six-cylinder unit for the Lincoln Continental luxury car. A
lengthy shutdown could hobble operations at the highly
profitable Wixom, Mich., plant that builds the Continental,
as well as the Lincoln Town Car and Lincoln Mark VII. The
Windsor plant also builds many of the engines for Ford's
U.S.-built Taurus and Sable midsized cars.
   Another Ford plant, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, is the sole
provider of auto glass to four of the company's light-truck
assembly operations in the U.S. A total of about 80% of
Ford's Canadian output is exported to the U.S.

   Licensing May Be Quickest Route to Foreign Markets

   Strategy Can Be Profitable Alternative
   To Investment Abroad, Lang Says

   Small companies often can make money by licensing their
concepts to foreign companies. Indeed, licensing may take off
overseas even before the products or processes involved have
established themselves in the U.S.
   So says Eugene M. Lang, president of REFAC Technology
Development Corp., a New York company that helps other
companies license their industrial technology. REFAC, founded
in 1952 by Mr. Lang, has negotiated hundreds of U.S. and
foreign manufacturing licenses. It is currently involved with
such diverse industrial technologies as liquid-crystal
displays, bar-code scanning and robotics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 72-year-old Mr. Lang says he has been an entrepreneur
since age eight, when he peddled to other boys lead-weighted
pieces for a game called street checkers. "It was a very
profitable business," he says. "It kept me in hot dogs and
anything else I needed."
   In an interview, Mr. Lang provided some insights on how
business owners can profit from licensing:
                                                                                                       

   Q. Why do so many small companies go into licensing,
rather than start their own operations overseas?
   A. Many small companies can't afford to invest capital in
foreign facilities, and they don't have personnel to send
over there. Often, small-company owners don't even have the
time to acquaint themselves with foreign markets. The
alternative is to license -- to find someone who can capture
the market for you who is already at home in that market.
                                                                                                       

   Q. How much income can a license produce, and how
significant might that be for a small company?
   A. We have royalty rates as low as one-eighth of 1% of
sales and as high as 15%. As a result, it's been my
experience that I've seen as much as one-third of total
profits for a small business being derived from overseas
licenses. And besides profit, there's invaluable feedback --
in research and development, marketing experience and
engineering -- that you get from foreign licensees. You have
an opportunity to exploit all that in the biggest and best
market of all, namely the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   Q. For example?
   A. With Heli-Coil {a fastener technology now owned by
Black &amp; Decker Corp.}, we had to develop an economic and
technical rationale for the products. We had to spend a lot
of money finding applications and testing them out, and the
experience we obtained through foreign licensees was of
tremendous value. We brought back to America all the
technical standards and proven applications. We later did the
same thing with a new type of rolling diaphragm {another
industrial part}.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Is there still untapped potential for small companies
to benefit from licensing?
   A. When I started out 40 years ago, just the word
"licensing" was something that applied more to a dog than to
a business. Now universities are involved in licensing, and
most big corporations are involved in licensing. There are
licensing textbooks. But the average small company hasn't
given much thought to licensing -- I would say there are
thousands that aren't even aware of it. And many think of
licensing only in terms of products, whereas licensing can
also be very important in terms of processes. Maybe I'm only
talking about bread -- a new process for mixing dough or for
packaging bread more effectively. A lot of business people
don't realize their processes can be licensed. Others are
intimidated; they're afraid they'll wind up giving their
secrets away for nothing.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Typically, when an opening does seem to exist, how long
does it take for a newcomer to licensing to start earning
royalties?
   A. You have to be prepared for it to be a slow process.
Normally you don't take a product and assume that anything is
going to happen in as little as one or two years. You have to
examine the market and figure how best to exploit it. For
example, if you have a patented process, how do you even
figure the basis for charging a royalty? Having a product or
process that's merely better or different is not enoughthere
has to be enough economic value in it that you can get your
share and keep the other guy profitable, too.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Meanwhile, how much does an inventor or small company
have to give up in exchange for marketing help overseas?
   A. At REFAC we normally work on a 50-50 basis; we share in
the gross proceeds of the venture. But for the inventor, 50%
of something is a lot better than 100% of nothing. If we
don't accomplish any good result, that's our loss.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Which parts of the world are best for seeking licensing
deals?
   A. The U.S., Japan and Western Europe, especially England,
France, Germany. Going elsewhere is often a waste of time --
you can accomplish deals but not make much money out of them.
For example, in India I was able to get the government to
approve joint ventures -- but then there were problems
getting dividends, getting raw materials, problems getting
import permits.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Why do you urge small companies to develop and license
trademarks as well as products?
   A. Patents dwindle in value as they age and as technology
advances. But trademarks become more valuable the longer
they're used. With Heli-Coil, the patent expired, but there
are still foreign royalties in the seven figures. That's
because of the trademark plus the ongoing exchange of knowhow
related to manufacturing improvements.
                                                                                                       

   Q. What's the first thing a newcomer to licensing needs to
think about?
   A. The first thing you have to do is define very
realistically what it is you have to offer. There are
enormous opportunities if manufacturers become introspective
and try to evaluate the novelty of their own manufacturing
experiences: What is it that makes them competitive, what is
it that makes their product better? You often make more money
from licensing your know-how for production or product
control than you could from actually selling your finished
product in a highly competitive market.

   WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court nominee David Souter told the
Senate Judiciary Committee that the Constitution protects an
implicit right to privacy, but he declined to spell out what
the right encompasses.
   On the first day of his Senate confirmation hearings,
Judge Souter responded to questions raised by Democratic
senators and some liberal groups by trying to demystify
himself and to depict himself as a humane, compassionate
judge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judges must always remember, he said, that "at the end of
our task some human being is going to be affected, some human
life is going to be changed."
   Questioned by seven of the 14 committee members, his
answers appeared designed to project an image of moderation,
of a judge who is even-tempered and well-versed in
constitutional law and Supreme Court history. Throughout his
four hours of testimony, he avoided controversy. The hearings
proceeded without rancor, even though he generally declined
to give his views on Supreme Court decisions, including Roe
vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that recognized the right to
abortion.
   None of his responses had the ring of conservative legal
thinking that were the focus of a confirmation fight and
Senate rejection of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court in
1987. His 14-minute opening statement said his role as a
judge is "to make the promises of the Constitution a reality
for our time and to preserve the Constitution for the
generations that will follow. . . ."
   In other comments, Judge Souter said the Constitution
clearly protects not only the right to privacy, but also
other rights that aren't expressly mentioned.
   Democratic senators on the committee, several of whom in
opening statements expressed concerns about Judge Souter's
record, gave little inkling of whether they were satisfied by
his testimony.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) said afterward he was
"not entirely" satisfied with the judge's responses. During
questioning by Sen. Metzenbaum about whether the nominee
understood the plight of women faced with unwanted
pregnancies, Judge Souter said that while at Harvard Law
School he once counseled a woman about abortion. "I learned
what is at stake," Judge Souter said, but he declined to
disclose what advice he offered. Sen. Metzenbaum said the
testimony was "very sincere, very touching, but does not
answer the question" of how the nominee regards abortion.
   Concern by some groups about the nominee's commitment to
civil liberties increased. Kate Michelman, director of the
National Abortion Rights Action League, said, "We learned
nothing." Nevertheless, nothing at the hearings, which will
continue today and next week, suggested the judge faces
difficulty being confirmed.
   The 50-year-old judge, a former New Hampshire Supreme
Court justice and attorney general as well as a Harvard Law
School graduate and Rhodes Scholar, was selected by President
Bush July 23 to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of
Justice William Brennan.
   Judge Souter's answers were often less pointed than the
questions.
   Asked by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) whether he
believes the 14th Amendment guarantee of "equal protection of
the laws" protects individuals from sex discrimination as
well as race discrimination, he said it does. But he said the
legal test applied by the Supreme Court in sex-discrimination
cases, written by Justice Brennan in 1976, is "too loose" to
be workable. He offered no substitute.
   Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), committee chairman, pressed
Judge Souter on whether he supports a 1965 Supreme Court
right-to-privacy ruling that protects the decision of married
people to use contraceptives. Judge Souter said that he
wouldn't endorse specific cases but that he recognized a
"fundamental" right of marital privacy protected by the
Constitution.
   When Sen. Biden asked if he thought the right to decide
whether to have children was protected by the Constitution,
Judge Souter said the right to procreate was part of the
"concept of marital privacy." But he never explained whether
he believes a similar right of reproductive freedom exists
for unmarried people.

   High Capital-Gains Tax Busts State Budgets

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)

<LP>
   Many state governments, particularly in coastal states
with a large proportion of affluent taxpayers, have faced
unexpected weakness in their tax receipts in the past three
or four years. This has led many states to introduce higher
income- and sales-tax rates, which damaged their own
economies and placed a significant drag on the national
economy as well.
   The states' choice is part of a downward spiral. States'
self-inflicted damage reduces federal tax receipts. Weak
federal receipts then increase the threat of higher federal
rates, hurting the economy and in turn weakening state
receipts. States then raise taxes, and the cycle continues.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One particular federal tax has had an especially harsh
impact on state tax receipts: the 33% maximum marginal tax
rate on capital gains enacted in 1986. Raising the maximum
marginal rate on capital gains to 33% from 20% stopped the
natural growth of taxable state income from this source.
States in which capital gains had previously been an
important source of taxable state income are finding weak tax
receipts, perhaps without understanding the reason.
   The chart shows realized capital gains (net after losses)
for the five states that account for nearly half the capital
gains in the entire nation (see accompanying chart -- WSJ
Sep. 14, 1990). Florida and Texas have no income tax, which
is one reason that many people who have accumulated
substantial assets live there. New York, California and
Illinois have long depended heavily on capital gains taxes.
So have New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and
Connecticut.
   Until recently, evidence that a high federal capital gains
rate has hurt state collections might have been deemed
ambiguous. People rushed to realize gains in 1986 because the
tax rate was about to rise to 28% the following year. It
might be argued too that in 1987 capital gains were weak
because of the October stock market crash, though there were
plenty of gains in the year's first eight months.
   In any case, the ambiguity ended when the Internal Revenue
Service released its 1988 estimates this spring. For all five
states in the chart, the amount of capital gains reported was
less than half of what it had been in 1986, the last year of
20% tax rates, and well below the level of 1985 (about 5%
lower, on average). This decline in taxable state income from
capital gains over three years occurred despite the
nationwide increase of more than 22% in personal income in
that same period.
   For the federal government, the weakness in realizations
since 1986 has been at least partly offset by a much higher
average tax rate on a small volume of capital gains. The
maximum federal capital gains tax was increased to 45% in
1975 from 27% in 1968. Yet so few of the affected
high-bracket taxpayers actually realized gains at the
punitive rates of 1975 that the average capital-gains tax (on
both excluded and taxable gains) remained exactly the same in
1975 as it had been in 1968: 15%. The 1985 reduction of the
highest capital gains tax to 20% percent so encouraged
efficient turnover of assets among higher-income taxpayers
that the average tax paid remained exactly what it had been
in the high-tax 1970s: 15%.
   In 1988, by contrast, the capital gains tax on the
highest-income taxpayers rose to 28% percent, but the average
tax rate rose to 24%. It is doubtful if there has ever been a
time in U.S. history when so many taxpayers faced tax rates
above 20% on the uncertain rewards from life savings.
   States in which capital gains were a particularly
important source of taxable income expected this source of
income to grow between 1985 and 1988. After all, the Dow
Jones average at the end of 1988 was 62% higher than it had
been in 1985. But the states were mugged by the federal tax
law of 1986. By imposing a 28-33% tax -- even on the inflated
capital gains of couples with rather modest incomes -- the
federal government made it extremely expensive for nearly all
taxpayers to realize any capital gains, particularly in
states that added their own tax on top of the federal levy,
where the combined capital gains burden could reach 39%.
Taxpayers responded by avoiding the sale of assets (except
under financial distress), and by making sure that their
future investments were not subject to combined capital-gains
taxes -- they invested in money-market funds instead of
growth stocks. Tax receipts collapsed in states most
dependent on capital gains -- including much of the
northeast.
   But this is not the only adverse effect of high federal
capital-gains taxes on state revenues. The increased federal
tax rate on capital gains also provides a greater incentive
to locate small businesses in states with little or no income
tax, because of the brutal combination of federal and state
capital-gains tax on those who sell their businesses. Loss of
deductibility for state income taxes would greatly aggravate
this effect for small businesses remaining in states like New
Jersey, New York and California. For taxpayers in a 33%
federal bracket and an 8% state bracket, for example, the
combined marginal tax on capital gains would rise to 41% from
the current 38%. Even fewer capital gains would then be
cashed in states with high income-tax rates.
   Governors of several states most injured by the federal
tax on capital gains are widely considered to be "liberal"
Democrats who are supposed to favor high federal tax rates on
capital gains out of ideological habit. Yet the evidence is
now clear that this federal tax clearly damages their own
state treasuries, even aside from its damaging effects on the
economic growth and on the value of real estate and other
assets. State governors properly complain about the many
other ways in which the federal government attempts to
preempt the states' tax bases -- by limiting the
deductibility of state income taxes or imposing higher
federal excise taxes. Since taxpayers do not have infinitely
deep pockets, the more the federal government takes, the less
is left for the states. Yet in the case of capital gains,
governors of the states most seriously injured appear willing
to impose draconian state tax rates on their citizens rather
than lobby for relief from this counterproductive federal
tax.

   Toshiba Plans
   To Launch Line
   Of Disk Drives

   Toshiba Corp. of Japan unveiled plans to deliver a new
generation of computer hard disk drives, a move that rattled
the stocks of several U.S. makers of disk drives.
   In Tokyo, Toshiba said it had developed a 2.5-inch, micro
hard disk drive with a storage capacity of about double that
of currently available 2.5-inch products. The company said
sample shipments would be available in Japan on Oct. 1, with
mass production set for April.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among the U.S. disk-drive makers whose stock fell on the
announcement was Conner Peripherals Inc., of San Jose, Calif.
Conner stock tumbled $1.625 a share to $20.625 a share in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday. Some 4.1 million
shares changed hands, making Conner the most active
over-the-counter issue.
   Also in over-the-counter trading, the stock of Seagate
Technology, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., declined 37.5
cents a share to $8.125. Quantum Corp. of Milpitas, Calif.,
fell $1.125 a share to $16.50.
   Toshiba's announcement highlighted the push to produce
smaller, yet more powerful, disk drives for increasingly
popular laptop computers and notebook-sized personal
computers. Toshiba's computer division announced on Wednesday
that it was boosting U.S. production of its popular line of
laptop computers.
   Some analysts said they believe Conner, for one, will be
able to fend off Toshiba's challenge. Steven Ossad, a
technology analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco,
said he expects Conner to introduce a 2.5-inch drive next
month that will beat the Toshiba product in value and
performance and will also be more generally available sooner.
   "This is not a particularly new phenomenon. When Conner
was in its earliest stages of development, Toshiba announced
a 3.5-inch product and there was the same jumpiness," said
Mr. Ossad.
   Toshiba's computer division has also been a significant
purchaser of Conner drives, accounting for about 5% of Conner
sales in the second quarter ended June 30, according to Mr.
Ossad. He said he didn't believe that relationship would be
hurt by the latest announcement.
   "Our relationship with the Toshiba computer division
remains very, very strong," said Carl Neun, Conner's chief
financial officer. "We believe we have competed very well in
getting business out of the computer division." He said the
new Toshiba product was a natural next step for the company,
and that Conner was aware that the announcement was coming.

   Two-Faced Bush --

   An abiding mystery of George Bush's leadership is its
split personality.
   On foreign and domestic policy, Mr. Bush can seem like two
different men. The one is decisive and cool under pressure.
The other is detached and quick to give in. Foreign Bush can
be stubborn about China, deft toward Europe and Mikhail
Gorbachev, gutsy in taking out Manuel Noriega. Domestic Bush
trades his tax pledge for nothing, treats Democratic leader
George Mitchell as if he were Sam Rayburn, turns the other
cheek to those who sandbagged John Tower.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Bush was at his best speaking to Congress this
week. His speech lacked flourish, as usual, but the subject
carried its own drama. The Members were rapt. Richard
Gephardt, the Democratic partisan, sounded like a statesman
in his party's response. Liberals warm to Mr. Bush's talk of
"international law," while conservatives admire his assertion
of "American leadership." Whatever the motive, Arthur
Vandenberg's rule applies: Having signed on at the take-off,
Congress won't so easily jump before the landing.
   Indiana's Richard Lugar, one of the Senate's cooler heads,
thinks members trust Mr. Bush in a crisis because so many
know him personally. Mr. Lugar was one of 11 old Congress
hands Mr. Bush invited to a dinner in the White House family
quarters two weeks ago. (Others included Sens. John Glenn of
Ohio and Bill Roth of Delaware, and House committee chairmen
Dante Fascell and John Dingell.)
   They talked over the nuances of the crisis most of the
evening. A day earlier, Mr. Lugar had said publicly that
something had to be done about Iraq's chemical and nuclear
weapons even if it left Kuwait. "As soon as I walked in the
door," Mr. Bush was asking about it, says the senator. "He's
fully conversant with the idea and isn't necessarily
opposed." Anybody think Ronald Reagan would have had the same
kind of dinner?
   Foreign Bush is so strong now that he may be able to
invigorate his alter-ego. His popularity ratings have soared
back into the 70% range. One ranking White House political
aide explains how Iraq has changed everything: "Two months
ago we were looking at, `Bush wants to raise taxes to cover
the S&amp;L mess.' Now we are saying, `If the world can unite to
fight Iraq, why can't Congress pass a budget?'"
   Domestic Bush has new political leverage, if he's willing
to use it. Barring a self-inflicted wound, Supreme Court
nominee David Souter will sprint through the Senate; Joe
Biden isn't likely to draw a line in his sandbox. A few
insiders say the president could even afford to veto the
Clean Air bill, as too costly in a time of crisis.
   But to succeed at home, Domestic Bush will have to play
against type and fight. He'll have to reject the arguments of
his friend William Coleman about Sen. Ted Kennedy's
civil-rights quota bill. The prominent black Republican has
been a Fifth Column telling Mr. Bush privately that the
Kennedy bill isn't really a quota bill. (Mr. Coleman was also
a chief accuser of Robert Bork.)
   Mr. Bush is well positioned politically to veto, having
framed the public debate as quotas or not. But, says one
senior aide, "I don't think he's very comfortable saying no
to Bill Coleman and Ben Hooks" (the NAACP chief).
   The biggest test is the budget. Having disarmed on taxes,
Mr. Bush had been in retreat. His Tuesday speech put him back
on offense. It framed the issue as economic growth first,
deficits second. His summit negotiators have suddenly found
some gumption, too. Budget Director Richard Darman had a
90-minute breakfast with GOP firebrand Newt Gingrich last
week, and adopted his 15% capital gains proposal and other
"growth incentives."
   Democrats are the ones moving for a change. At the budget
summit, they first offered to increase non-defense spending
over five years. Republicans rolled their eyes. After
haggling, Democrats asked for the GOP "bottom line."
Republicans said cuts of $120 billion.
   Democrats came back with less than $100 billion.
Republicans rolled their eyes again, and Mr. Darman inveighed
on the meaning of "bottom line." This prompted Sen. Robert
Byrd, the courtly but obstinate West Virginian, to assert
that he hadn't been treated this way in all his years in the
Senate.
   Taxes are the Gordian knot. Republicans want a capital
gains cut, but Democrats want an income tax hike to "pay"
(politically) for it. On top of likely increases in beer,
luxury, cigarette, gasoline and other taxes, a higher income
tax would be a major defeat -- for Mr. Bush and the economy.
   The political (and perhaps Mr. Darman's) temptation will
be to accept even a mediocre agreement, then bask in the
huzzahs of a city that defines "leadership" as more federal
revenues. But a pact that endangers the economy won't reduce
the deficit and will leave Domestic Bush weaker than before
(weakening Foreign Bush besides). The more difficult choice
would be to play brinksmanship until Congress gives him a
decent deal and a capital gains cut.
   George Bush has been underestimated, in part because his
own unrhetorical presidency follows the most effective
rhetorical president since FDR. Mr. Bush's leadership is
personal, discreet, hands-on. (It's no accident that Michael
Deaver's former office is this president's private dining
room.) But whatever leadership is, it starts before the
water's edge.

   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co., in a major
movie-making partnership between a Hollywood studio and a
Japanese entity, said it formed a $100 million joint venture
with Interscope Communications and Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown,
which is 80%-owned by Tokyo-based Nomura Securities.
   According to the four-year agreement, Disney and Nomura
Babcock &amp; Brown will each make an initial contribution of $50
million to produce and market movies. The pool could be
doubled, or more, by the parties if increased production
requires it.
</LP>

   Disney likes to share the risks on its movies, and this
arrangement represents a departure from its usual method of
financing motion pictures through Silver Screen partnerships,
which help pay production costs for most Disney films. Disney
is bolstering its film output from about 15 this year to
about 25 next year, and the current Silver Screen partnership
will end in several months.
   "We're looking at new sources of financing," said Walt
Disney Studios Vice President Richard Frank in an interview.
"The success of Silver Screen has encouraged other investors
to approach us with various proposals." Among them, he said,
are other Japanese investors.
   Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown will fund the venture by selling
partnership interests to investors in Japan, mostly large
private corporations, in what will be the largest
film-related syndication in Japan ever, according to Managing
Director Richard Coffey. Japanese investors are known to be
interested in Hollywood, but except for Sony Corp.'s $3.4
billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment last
year, they've approached it delicately: Nomura Babcock &amp;
Brown invested $25 million in independent Morgan Creek
Productions last year, and Victor Co. of Japan Ltd. invested
$100 million in Largo Entertainment, another independent
production company.
   Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown formed a partnership with
Interscope last December to seek a studio partner, and Disney
has a long relationship with Interscope. Interscope has had
an existing contract to submit film projects to Disney first,
and if Disney decides to finance the picture, Interscope
generally will produce the film for a fee. The new joint
venture also will be nonexclusive but give Disney a "first
look." The venture would produce perhaps three films a year,
under either the Touchstone, Hollywood or Disney banners.
   Interscope was founded in 1982 by Ted Field, an heir to
the Marshall Field fortune who came to Hollywood. For Disney,
Interscope's films have included "Three Men and a Baby,"
"Outrageous Fortune" and "Cocktail."

   In a time of urban turmoil, please note the good sense of
the people of the District of Columbia. In their Democratic
primary for mayor, they have nominated Sharon Pratt Dixon to
run for the office held by Marion Barry. Ms. Dixon, far back
in the pack before election day, had two distinguishing
characteristics: She denounced Mayor Barry and she promised
to fire many D.C. officials. In November she faces the
Republican nominee, former D.C. Police Chief Maurice Turner.
We think this outcome confirms our sense of what the Barry
jury's decision to convict on only a minor charge actually
represented. It reflected an awareness that the lessons of
the Marion Barry story had been well absorbed by residents
and that it was time for the District to get on with
rebuilding its politics and its values. In selecting Sharon
Pratt Dixon, District voters signaled that they are eager to
renew their city.

   TORONTO -- Bank of Montreal cut its prime lending rate a
quarter of a percentage point to 13.75%, its lowest level
since January.
   John Parish, the bank's assistant chief economist, said
the rate reduction was prompted by a recent decline in
short-term Canadian interest rates and by the country's
economic slowdown. The prime rate is the base rate charged on
loans to businesses and individuals.

<TEXT>
   It was the second time in two weeks that Bank of Montreal
cut its prime rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Other
major Canadian banks have kept their prime rates at 14.25%.
   The Bank of Montreal action followed a decline in the Bank
of Canada bank rate yesterday to 12.7% from 12.82%. The bank
rate is the levy by the central bank on loans to financial
institutions. The bank rate, which has declined for 12
consecutive weeks, is set weekly at a quarter of a percentage
point above the average yield on three-month Canadian
government treasury bills at the Thursday bill auction.

   So far, the Persian Gulf crisis has overshadowed almost
every other issue on the campaign trail. That may change next
week. Oklahoma could become the first state in the nation to
limit the number of terms its state legislators can serve. If
you want to hear a blowout louder than anything likely to
occur in the Gulf, ask an incumbent politician what he or she
thinks of term limitation. Term limitation may yet become the
campaign's sleeper issue.
   The Oklahoma initiative would limit any legislator to a
total of 12 years in either house. More than 200,000 voters
signed petitions to place it on the ballot, and it has
attracted bipartisan support. If Oklahoma approves term
limitation it will provide a big boost to parallel efforts in
Colorado and California. The Colorado initiative is
significant in that it also seeks to limit the terms of
office the state's Members of Congress can serve.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The initiative's sponsor, State Senator Terry Considine,
points out that the Constitution gives the states the power
to regulate the "time, manner and place" of elections to
Congress. In the past, states have been given broad authority
to establish their own election procedures. About half of the
states elected Senators by a form of popular vote before the
constitutional amendment for direct election of Senators
passed, and Texas allowed both Lyndon Johnson and Lloyd
Bentsen to run for vice president and re-election to the
Senate at the same time.
   Term limitation is an issue that is instinctively popular
with voters. National surveys show it is favored by two to
one in all sections of the country and by all income groups.
Blacks favor it even more than whites, women more than men.
Last week, the California Poll found the more restrictive of
the two term-limitation measures on the ballot was favored by
72% of voters with only 14% opposed. A surprising 46% said
they strongly supported the idea.
   None of this fazes one of the nation's great proponents of
keeping politicians sitting pretty: Democratic Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, the operator of an awesome political
machine in California. Earlier this year, Speaker Brown
defeated redistricting reform initiatives with commercials
that linked them with corporate greed, the Exxon Valdez spill
and dead otters. Ironically, Mr. Brown's allies strong-armed
corporations into financing that $7 million campaign with
subtle threats that those that didn't contribute would see
their interests under attack in the legislature.
   Naturally, Mr. Brown views term limitation as a threat to
his empire. Speaker Brown plans to finance his projected $4
million campaign against term limitation with the same
squeeze plays that have worked for him in the past. Dan
Walters, a columnist for the Sacramento Bee, reports Mr.
Brown has been "hammering" corporations to buy $1,000 tickets
to a Beverly Hills anti-term-limitation fund-raiser, which
was to be held last night. Organizers report the final take
from the event should be $1.6 million.
   The great fear, of course, is that if term limitation
passes in a state as politically important as California, it
could create the kind of nationwide political tidal wave that
sent Proposition 13's tax-cutting movement rolling across the
country in 1978. Just as the anti-tax movement came to rest
in Washington, the term-limitation movement may some day wash
through the halls and offices of Congress.

   MCI Account Put Up for Review;
   Current Agency Will Participate

   MCI Communications has put up for review its $50
million-plus account, which has been at Wells, Rich, Greene
since 1987.
   In an interview, Judy Ranzer, MCI's senior vice president
of advertising, said Wells Rich will participate in the
review of the long-distance phone service company's account
along with four other agencies, which she declined to
identify.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In the last three years, our advertising needs have grown
enormously," Ms. Ranzer said. "We thought it was time to take
a deep breath and take stock of what was available to us from
agencies' strategic and creative thinking." The review is
expected to be completed by the end of November.
   Despite those comments, Ms. Ranzer praised Wells Rich's
creative work as "truly excellent." People close to the
account said MCI, although routinely enthused with the shop's
"strategic ideas," has been frustrated by what it sees as
Wells Rich's creative inconsistency. New York-based Wells
Rich created MCI's "Let Us Show You" campaign pitching its
long-distance services.
   In addition, industry executives said MCI has been
dismayed by the game of musical chairs among the senior staff
on the account at Wells Rich. Initially, J. Dixon Byrne, an
executive vice president, led the business. But after a year,
he moved to another account, and Charles Evans took the reins
briefly before being dismissed. Paula Kahn, an executive vice
president who previously headed up Wells Rich's Gardner
Advertising unit, also had a brief stint as the account's
leader.
   Another industry executive said the review may have been
called in part because of some shifts in MCI's upper
management.
   The review of the big account comes as MCI has slowly been
increasing its share of the long-distance business. According
to Joel Gross, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, New
York, MCI controls 16% of the U.S. long-distance market,
making it a distant competitor to American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, which controls 68%. US Sprint controls about 10%
of the market.
   "In this very competitive marketplace, you've got to find
the best weapons that you can get your hands on," Mr. Gross
said. "I think that AT&amp;T has been fairly effective recently
with their `Put It in Writing' campaign to slow down the
attack of the competitors. My guess is that MCI is looking
for something to come back with."
   Mr. Gross and other analysts said the AT&amp;T campaign, which
takes direct shots at its smaller competitors and their
claims of discount prices, has threatened to slow the growth
of MCI's market share. AT&amp;T, of course, has a much bigger
advertising budget than MCI, spending about $550 million last
year.
   MCI, meanwhile, has continued with businesslike ads that
attempt to show the gentlemanly service MCI offers. One
recent campaign, themed "Big-business long distance for your
business," pitched a service called MCI Vision for small and
medium-sized business customers. The ads used a funky camera
technique to make it appear as though a pint-sized
businessmen is growing larger as he walks toward the camera.
"Why is MCI the only company that sees us as we really are?"
an announcer asks in one ad. "Maybe they have a little better
perspective."
   The ads are far different from early MCI spots, including
one that featured comedienne Joan Rivers spouting off about
MCI as a feisty, young company with cheap rates. Analysts
said, though, that MCI has focused on small and medium-sized
businesses because competition has squeezed margins in the
residential and big-business segments.
   It couldn't be determined which agencies would be
considered for the account. But some executives speculated
that Scali, McCabe, Sloves, a unit of WPP Group, and Levine,
Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver, two agencies that contended for
the account when it was reviewed in 1987, might be involved.
Another industry executive said Grey Advertising might be on
the short list.
   The loss of the MCI account would be a setback for Wells
Rich, which has made a number of staff changes in its
creative department in a bid to reignite its creative
firepower. Wells Rich's new-business record of late has been
healthy, although it is also under the gun on the giant $60
million Benson &amp; Hedges account from Philip Morris Cos. It is
a finalist for a big new ad assignment from Chase Manhattan
Corp.
   One factor in Wells Rich's favor is a personal connection.
Richard Hopple, the agency's president, has a close
relationship with Ms. Ranzer, the top advertising executive
at MCI. He previously was the senior account man on the MCI
account when it was at D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, another
New York agency.
   Kenneth Olshan, chairman of Wells Rich, said yesterday his
agency will vigorously defend the MCI account. "We've done
great work for MCI and we welcome the challenge to present
ourselves to management," he said.

   GM Cuts Commitments
                                                                                                       

   General Motors is making fewer firm commitments to buy
print and TV advertising next year, Philip Guarascio, GM's
executive director for marketing programs and advertising,
said in a speech yesterday before the Women's Advertising
Club of New York.
   The policy shift means those media deals GM does make
"will be bigger and run longer," Mr. Guarascio noted. For
instance, he said, "we will be reducing our firm magazine
deals by 25% to 30% for 1991." While GM may end up buying the
same number of magazine ad pages by year-end, he added, "not
as many will be locked into a schedule as we have had in the
past."
   He said the auto giant wants greater advertising
flexibility because of the uncertain economic outlook -- even
though GM's overall ad expenditures "look relatively steady"
for 1991. The company spent about $1.29 billion on
advertising in 1988, according to a tally by Advertising Age
magazine.

shipments.
   Jacques Bougie, president and chief operating officer,
said Alcan's shipments of aluminum ingot and products in the
third quarter "will be at least equal" to second quarter
shipments of 581,000 metric tons. A metric ton equals 2,204.6
pounds.
   Alcan executives declined to comment directly on earnings.
But Mr. Morton said compared with the first six months "I
don't think things have changed dramatically in the second
half." In the half, Alcan had net income of $256 million, or
$1.09 a share.

   WASHINGTON -- A little-noticed provision of the housing
bill would create the first housing entitlement program, one
requiring rental subsidies to families whose children are
threatened with foster care because of inadequate housing.
   The program, authored by Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.),
is aimed at keeping families from splitting because of
deficient housing. Though deficit pressures and cost concerns
could darken the plan's prospects, the proposal has some
bipartisan support. The initiative would require about $1
billion in budget authority over five years, according to
Congressional Budget Office estimates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Schumer said an entitlement, which makes a specific
amount of funding automatically available each year, was
necessary because "otherwise these kids will be forgotten.
There is such a shortage of housing dollars and such a fight
over them."
   Both the House and the Senate have passed legislation that
would overhaul federal housing programs. But it is unclear
whether the entitlement provision, which isn't included in
the Senate version, will survive when the legislation goes
into conference.

   Judge Thomas Griesa's review of Robert Goldwin's book
about the Constitution -- "Why Blacks, Women, and Jews Are
Not Mentioned in the Constitution, and Other Unorthodox
Views" -- contains the questionable assertion that ". . .
when abolition (of slavery) finally came, it was the laws and
practices of certain states that needed to be changed, not
the Constitution." (Leisure &amp; Arts, Aug. 22)
   He seems to have forgotten the 13th, 14th and 15th
amendments to the Constitution, all of which specifically
addressed slavery and its consequences. The 13th Amendment
specifically uses the word "slavery," in order to abolish it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Slavery was not abolished, as Mr. Griesa (or perhaps Mr.
Goldwin) suggests, by changing the laws of a few states. It
was partially abolished by the Abraham's Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation and the good offices of the Union
Army; but several slaves states fought on the side of the
Union and other states that had outlawed slavery long before
had done so with grandfather clauses that perpetuated it in
isolated instances. For example, there were still a few
elderly slaves in New Jersey at the outbreak of the Civil
War. It was the 13th Amendment that formally eliminated
slavery.
   The word "slavery" does not appear prior to the 13th
Amendment because the authors of the Constitution preferred
euphemism to defending the indefensible, a not uncommon
political response to embarrassing realities. Even the
slaveholders preferred euphemism, with "servant" being the
favored description for the victims of the Peculiar
Institution.
   That embarrassment was particularly acute because the
members of the Philadelphia convention were otherwise staunch
defenders of human liberty and intended the Constitution to
serve that noble end, and it has, for the most part, in the
ensuing two centuries.

   Atlanta Is Coming On Strong in Race
   For 1996 Olympics Despite a Late Start

   ATLANTA -- Keeping a straight face was difficult.
   In early 1987, word filtered through the amateur athletic
world that some people in Atlanta had actually decided to bid
for the 1996 Olympic Games.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gee, what a nice idea, said amused sports officials in
cities like Toronto, Athens, Greece, and Melbourne,
Australia, all of which had already invested thousands of
hours and millions of dollars in their own bids for the
Games. It's just unfortunate, they said, that Atlanta was
starting too late with too little -- except a considerable
naivete about the cutthroat business of international
athletics.
   Which is like saying Scarlett was naive about Rhett.
   Starting with nine volunteers and working in near-total
obscurity, naive Atlanta has managed to elbow its way to the
front of the race for the biggest and -- with estimated
revenue of $3.5 billion -- the richest prize in sports. With
the vote in Tokyo just four days away, William Payne,
president of the Atlanta Organizing Committee, says only, "We
have a very legitimate chance of winning." But Richard Pound,
an International Olympic Committee vice president in
Montreal, is less guarded. Atlanta, he says "has one of the
best teams -- if not the best -- in the field."
   There are no guarantees, of course. Looming over all the
entrants is Athens, the strong sentimental favorite. Athens
was the host of the first modern Olympics in 1896, and is all
but demanding that the Games be returned to Greece for the
100th anniversary.
   Emotions, however, don't always win Olympic Games,
according to those familiar with the process. Rather, it is
the perpetual and intimate lobbying of the 88 voting members
of the IOC that counts.
   Enter Atlanta, where self-promotion is a major industry.
Yes, some cities have spent more money on their Olympic bids
(Athens is nearing $30 million while Atlanta will come in
under $7 million), and others have spent more time (Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, has been at this since 1985). But Atlanta, once
it decided to enter the fray, has come on like a battering
ram.
   Back in 1987, for instance, the cities of Minneapolis, San
Francisco and Nashville, Tenn., slapped a few postage stamps
on their bids to be the U.S. standard bearer for 1996 and
mailed them off to the U.S. Olympic Committee in Colorado.
Not Atlanta. Mr. Payne flew to Colorado and delivered the
city's bid over breakfast. Ditto in 1989, when team Atlanta
hand-carried its bid documents (five volumes, bound in black,
weighing 17 pounds and costing about $750,000) to the IOC's
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
   Those books are filled with striking drawings of what
Atlanta's organizers envision their Olympics would look like.
But that's one problem with the city's bullish bid: Much of
it is still on the drawing board. Atlanta estimates it would
have to shell out $1 billion to stage the Games -- almost
twice what Los Angeles spent -- primarily because of the need
to build, among other facilities, an 80,000-seat
track-and-field stadium and an Olympic village for the
athletes. Total planned cost of new construction: more than
$400 million.
   Atlanta's boosters dismiss such concerns by pointing to
the revenue side of the ledger. They estimate the city will
have about $1.16 billion to play with -- about $400 million
more than Los Angeles -- primarily because of more lucrative
broadcast rights (a projected $549 million vs. $286 million
in 1984) and bigger sponsorship fees ($324 million vs. $126
million). Confidently, the organizers see a surplus at the
end of the Games of about $156 million.
   Less confidently, Donald Ratajczak, director of the
Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, says
Atlanta "may be able to break even." "Their sponsorship
estimates are high. Companies aren't doling out that kind of
money anymore for sports." But that could be offset, he says,
by higher TV revenue.
   While Atlanta may have been a bit short on facilities, it
"did a tremendous job of getting {IOC} members to visit,"
says Mr. Pound in Montreal. In all, 70 of the IOC's 88
members made the trek to Georgia, and, once there, were
dipped, rolled and fried in Southern hospitality.
   In the summer of 1989, for instance, the president of the
International Canoe Federation had asked to visit the Ocoee
River in northern Georgia, where the canoeing events would be
held. Before arriving, however, Atlanta officials discovered
the river was dry, the result of a closed dam upstream in
Tennessee. The solution: Call Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander
and ask him to ask the Tennessee Valley Authority to open the
gates. "Voila, white water]" says Robert Brennan, a spokesman
for the Atlanta Organizing Committee.
   Moving through all these encounters -- lobbying officials
from Libya or canvassing visitors from Cameroon -- has been
Atlanta's trump card: Andrew Young. The former ambassador to
the United Nations and former mayor of Atlanta was an early
supporter of the city's bid and brought an instant cachet to
its efforts.
   Evoking the name of Martin Luther King Jr., whom he served
as a principal aide, and recalling the spirit of the
civil-rights movement, Mr. Young was able to gain the
confidence and support of Olympic officials, particularly
those from the Third World, who otherwise may have dismissed
a bid from the U.S.
   All these efforts, of course, are designed to maximize
Atlanta's appeal and minimize the baggage it carries. One
obvious problem is the fact that the U.S. had the Summer
Games, in Los Angeles, just six years ago. Another is that
the U.S. government has been a less-than-sterling supporter
of the Olympics. (Remember Jimmy Carter's 1980 boycott of
Moscow?)
   Atlanta's organizers have tried to turn the Los Angeles
problem into an advantage, arguing first of all that seven of
the past 15 Summer Games have been held in Europe in an area
smaller than the distance from Los Angeles to Atlanta. And,
they ask, what country was host of the most successful (read:
profitable) Olympics ever? Why, the U.S., of course. (The
city has already promised to split any surplus from the Games
with the IOC.)
   So what remains in Atlanta's path? Five hurdles: Belgrade;
Manchester, England; Toronto, Melbourne and Athens. The first
two are dismissed as serious contenders by most observers:
Both lack many of the basic amenities, like major airports
and extensive hotel space, that the IOC looks for. Toronto is
a city divided; several civic groups have noisily questioned
the wisdom of spending $1 billion on a track meet. Melbourne
bills itself as the city free from strife, but can't quite
get around the problem that it is far from anywhere. And
Athens -- well, Athens is one of the dirtiest and
least-efficient capitals in the world.
   Which the IOC might ignore altogether.
   "Right now, I'd put Atlanta dead even with Athens," says
John Bevilaqua, a vice president at the Los Angeles Games who
now heads a sports marketing firm in Atlanta. A strong -- and
sentimental -- European bloc in the IOC, some of whom Mr.
Bevilaqua refers to as the Old Guard, "may want to take the
Games back to Athens," he says. "But the `New Guard' is
looking for a city to take us into the next 100 years."

   NEW YORK -- Perceptions that problems in the banking
industry are deteriorating prompted investors to pour more
cash into short-term Treasury bills and notes. The buying
binge helped short-term Treasurys outperform the broader bond
market.
   "Whenever you hear about problems in the banking system,
that tends to help the bill market," said Sung Won Sohn, a
senior vice president and chief economist at Norwest Corp.,
Minneapolis.

   Bond dealers said investors were liquidating various bank
deposits and bank-issued securities and investing the
proceeds in three-month and six-month Treasury bills and, to
a smaller extent, two-year Treasury notes. These securities
are considered the safest in the world and tend to be in big
demand when there are signs of economic or political trouble.
   Traders said investors have been purchasing larger amounts
of bills for several months, but the buying seemed to pick up
modestly yesterday as a result of a number of recent reports
about the poor health of the banking industry. And because
the market was so thinly traded yesterday, some dealers said
the Treasury bill purchases may have appeared more sizable
than they really were.
   On Wednesday the Congressional Budget Office told the
Senate Banking Committee that it expects 600 to 700 banks
failures to occur by 1993. On Tuesday, one of the nation's
biggest banks, Chase Manhattan Corp., was forced to reset the
rate on $200 million of auction-rate notes to 13.017% from
9.66%. The new high rate is considered a sign that investors
are leery of owning securities issued by bank holding
companies.
   Many analysts have said the banking industry isn't as bad
off as the CBO report or the Chase Manhattan auction results
would seem to suggest. Moreover, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan told Congress yesterday that banking isn't
headed for a disaster on the scale of the savings-and-loan
crisis. But investors apparently aren't taking any chances.
   "We've been seeing investors who have moved out of {bank
issued} commercial paper and {certificates of deposit} and
into Treasury bills," for months, said William Brachfeld,
manager of trading at Daiwa Securities America Inc. However,
Mr. Brachfeld said the Chase Manhattan reset note auction
cast a new spotlight on the problems of the industry.
   He said that huge amounts of money aren't flowing out of
the banks into the bond market. But, "even if you just have
10% of money shifting from one place to another place, it can
have a profound impact on the market," he said.
   The "safe-haven" buying of short-term securities widened
the gap between the Treasury's two-year note and the
benchmark 30-year bond to .96 percentage point from .92
percentage point on Wednesday. The Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond ended slightly lower while the yield rose to
8.96% from 8.94%. Prices of two-year notes ended slightly
higher to yield 7.999%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bond market, weary after three days of heavy
selling by the Resolution Trust Corp., fell yesterday as
tumbling stock prices helped accelerate the market's decline.
   According to Elizabeth Specter, director of the Resolution
Trust Corp.'s division of finance and administration, the RTC
had been selling about $150 million of junk bonds a week
prior to the Persian Gulf crisis and now is getting back up
to that level of sales.
   In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee
yesterday, Ms. Specter also presented Congress with
statistics showing that the thrift bailout agency sold $550
million of junk bonds to date. As of July 31, the RTC's junk
bond holdings stood at $3.7 billion.
   The high-yield market had been hit by selling pressure all
this week after the RTC, the federal agency set up to
liquidate the holdings of the nation's crippled thrifts, sold
about $100 million in junk bonds.
   In trading yesterday, junk bonds ended between 3/8 to 1/2
point lower in light trading.
   Among the biggest losers of the day were pay-in-kind bonds
of RJR Nabisco Inc., which pay interest in the form of
additional bonds instead of cash.
   Since the bonds are widely held by equity investors, they
tend to plunge whenever the equity market registers sharp
losses.
   RJR Nabisco's 17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, finished down 1 3/8 points at 110 3/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the 17%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended
1 1/2 points lower at 86 7/8.
   The recently depressed junk bonds of Burlington Holdings
Inc. were hit again yesterday. Burlington's 14.25%
subordinated debentures, due in 1999, shed four points to end
at a bid price of 61 on continued concerns that the textile
maker will be financially pinched in a recession.
   Other high-yield bonds posting losses were securities
issued by Darling-Delaware Co. Although Darling-Delaware's
14% senior subordinated notes, due in 1999, were quoted 3/4
point higher at a bid price of 22 3/4, high-yield traders
said the bonds are now widely being traded "flat" or without
seven points of accrued interest in this case.
   Bondholders who bought the bonds before yesterday would
have typically had to pay the seven points of accrued
interest, bringing the actual price of the bonds to 29.
   However, reports that the company lacks the cash to pay
interest on its high-yield junk bonds prompted many traders
to quote the bonds without accrued interest.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended lower after a
rocky day. But short-term securities ended unchanged to
firmer.
   In early trading, long-term bond prices rose after Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan restated the Fed's position
that an easing in short-term interest rates was probable if
Congress approved a deficit reduction plan that was
well-received by the financial markets.
   But later in the session, Iraqi threats of possible
terrorist attacks against American targets in retaliation for
so-called "crimes" against the Arab and Islamic nations
prompted a small rise in oil prices. Long-term bonds then
headed lower.
   Also pressuring bonds and intermediate maturity government
securities was stronger-than-expected car sales for the early
September selling period. North American-made autos sold at a
7.1 million unit seasonally adjusted annual rate in the
10-day period, unchanged from the previous period.
   The steady sales pace forced many investors to reassess
their outlook for the economy.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond was quoted late at 97 23/32,
down from 5/32 from Wednesday, to yield 8.96%. The two-year
note ended at 100 6/32, up from 100 5/32, to yield 7.999%.
   The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills fell to
7.36% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.58%, while the
discount rate on six-month bills ended at 7.28% to yield
7.67%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were generally unchanged with some issues
trading 1/4 point higher.
   Secondary market activity was thin ahead of the release of
August producer price index data today.
   The focus continued to be on new issues, which were
well-received, traders said.
   In the new issue market, after a three-year hiatus,
Louisiana received a creditable reception for an issue of
$199 million general obligation bonds by a Lehman Brothers
group.
   The bonds were priced to yield from 6.10% in 1991 to 7.60%
in 2009 and 2010. Underwriting officials said all of the
bonds had been sold within three hours of the pricing.
   Approximately 60% of the Louisiana bonds were placed
directly with investors, with the remaining 40% going into
dealer inventories, a Lehman official said.
   Among active issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issues due 2018 was unchanged at 97 7/8 to yield 7.37%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage &amp; Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities prices edged slightly higher in
listless trading.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
for September delivery rose 1/32 to 98 29/32 while Federal
National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities rose 2/32 at
99 3/32.
   Two new asset-backed offerings were announced yesterday-a
$500 million credit-card issue by a unit of Signet Banking
Corp. and a $300 million Federal National Mortgage
Association Remic offering backed by Fannie Mae 9 1/2%
securities. Both were priced by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
   The class A senior portion of the credit card securities
were priced at 99 37/64 to yield 9.19% while the class B
subordinated portion of the issue was priced at 99 5/8 to
yield 9.588%.
   Goldman didn't release details on the Remic issue.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government auctioned 1.2 trillion yen ($8.69
billion) of new three-month bills at an average yield of
8.27%.
   The yield, one of the highest at a Japanese bill auction
in recent years, was 3/4 percentage point higher than yields
on three-month U.S. Treasury bills, but still not high enough
to generate strong demand.
   "This was a very good auction for the government," said
Nitoshi Ohara, a bond trader manager at Daiwa Securities Inc.
But he said the bills were not popular with investors because
the yields were too low. "We were looking for yields of more
than 8.40%," he said.
   Although the average yield on Japan's new three-month
bills was up from 7.852% at the previous three-month bill
auction, Mr. Ohara notes that new three-month certificates of
deposit now yield about 8.46%.
   Japan's Ministry of Finance said the auction garnered a
total 2.213 trillion yen of bids. Thus, the bid-to-cover
ratio, which measures the bids received for each bid
accepted, was 1.84.
   In trading yesterday, Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year
bond fell 0.23 point to 82.09 to yield 8.345%.

   PRINCETON, N.J. -- The David Sarnoff Research Center
signed a new agreement valued at more than $100 million to
continue research and development work with the consumer
electronics unit of Paris-based Thomson S.A.
   Under the multi-year agreement, the Sarnoff Center will
continue pursuing new technologies for television systems,
displays and TV receivers carrying the RCA name, officials
said.

   Senate Panel Cuts
   Most New Funding
   For NASA Project

   WASHINGTON -- A Senate Appropriations subcommittee dealt a
major blow to the administration's space program by wiping
out virtually all new funding for the Moon and Mars
initiative and cutting $863.6 million from the space
station's fiscal 1991 budget.
   Total funding for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration would grow to $13.45 billion in the year
beginning Oct. 1, but the cut from the proposed space station
represents a 35% reduction from the president's request and
would end much of the project as now envisioned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The administration is certain to fight to restore funds,
but the reductions highlight the vulnerability of the entire
NASA program given the pressure for domestic spending cuts.
"I can figure out a lot of ways for the space station to
survive," said one committee analyst, "but I don't know how
you sustain NASA" in later years.
   The Moon-Mars initiative is most vulnerable given the cuts
voted earlier by the House, and the Senate action reflects
the choices facing lawmakers as allocations for domestic
programs are reduced further. Much of the administration's
request for the space shuttle is protected, but the
CRAF-Cassini project, an ambitious follow-on to the
celebrated Voyager mission, would lose one of its two
spacecraft, and NASA's request for the high-speed national
aerospace plane would be cut nearly 37%.
   NASA's costly Earth Observing System satellite program is
preserved near the administration's request, but the
subcommittee cut the hardware for the larger EOS platforms by
one-third to $88 million. Part of the savings would be
redistributed to more than double the proposed budget for the
smaller Earth probe satellites to $56 million, with the
largest increase to a project focusing on tropical rain
forests and climatic and atmospheric changes.
   The bill reverses a House decision to kill an ongoing
project for studying extraterrestrial life, but would block a
$10 million House initiative to fund a synthetic-aperture
radar program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the
California Institute of Technology.
   The pressure on the space program is increased by the fact
that it competes directly with housing, environmental, and
veterans accounts within the same subcommittee. The total
bill allocates nearly $78.6 billion in new spending authority
within fiscal 1991. But given the vagaries of the budget
process, NASA finds itself most directly in competition with
the rising costs of veterans medical care.
   For veterans care, the subcommittee approved the full
administration request of more than $12.2 billion. Elsewhere,
National Science Foundation appropriations would rise 14% to
$2.36 billion, or only slightly below the president's
request. An estimated $6.02 billion is provided for the
Environmental Protection Agency and related programs,
including a 23% increase in pollution abatement and control
programs from current funding.
   The most serious policy differences are likely to involve
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where the
subcommittee added more than $3 billion from current funding
for federally subsidized housing. Though relatively
slow-spending, the commitment represents a 38% increase above
fiscal 1990 and assumes funding for 125,000 new units of
housing, or about 40,000 more than this year's level.
   Within the same account, lawmakers allocated $50 million
for "special purpose grants," and while giving HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp sufficient funding for two of his initiatives,
influential members used their position to earmark the
remainder for more than 20 projects of their own.

   My colleagues and I are accustomed to seeing attacks by
Nina Shea on Americas Watch. Accordingly, her Aug. 24
Americas column, "Uncovering the Awful Truth of Nicaragua's
Killing Fields," came as no surprise. Nevertheless, because
it distorts the record it requires a response.
   Americas Watch was founded in 1981 and published its first
report on Nicaragua in May 1982. In that report, we discussed
a massacre by Sandinista troops of Miskito Indians at Leimus.
So far as I know, that was the first time that episode, which
took place five months earlier, was reported internationally.
In subsequent reports we chronicled many additional violent
abuses by Sandinista troops and security forces: killings,
disappearances, torture. At the same time, we distinguished
between abuses that we found to be a matter of policy by the
Sandinistas, such as forced relocations and abusive
interrogation practices, and more violent abuses, which were
more sporadic.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Shea says we ignored abuses reported by refugees, but
then, contradictorily, notes that we retraced the steps taken
by her group to interview them. What she leaves out is that,
in May 1987, after we also conducted on-site investigations
in Nicaragua, I sent a public letter to President Daniel
Ortega providing far more detailed information on Sandinista
abuses than Ms. Shea's group had reported. In just one of the
episodes discussed in my 17-page letter, we reported up to 50
killings by Sandinista troops and provided 23 names. That
letter was reproduced in a report we published in May 1987.
Thereafter, we published several additional reports in 1988
and 1989 in which we said that killings of Contra supporters
that we had uncovered during those years amounted to a
pattern, or a policy of such killings.

   Program-Trading Inquiry
   Is Said to Find Little Abuse

   NEW YORK -- Three major exchanges, concluding a yearlong
investigation into alleged program-trading abuses, have found
no evidence of large-scale illicit activity, according to
people familiar with the exchanges' efforts.
   The detailed probe covers several volatile trading days in
1989 and 1990. People familiar with the investigation, which
is in its final stages, say the exchanges aren't willing to
say manipulative program trading has never occurred. But
allegations of frequent, orchestrated abuses couldn't be
supported by the inquiry, they say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The investigation is a joint effort by the New York Stock
Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   In program trading, brokers rapidly buy and sell big
baskets of stocks, futures and options to lock in fleeting
price differences. Ever since the 1987 stock market crash,
many investors have claimed that manipulative program trading
was a major cause of big stock-market price swings.
   Critics also have charged that big Wall Street securities
firms were conspiring to move markets for illicit
self-enrichment using computerized trading strategies.
   The three exchanges are looking for examples of customer
front-running, where brokers would trade ahead of large
customer orders that were bound to have a market impact.
   They are also inspecting trading records for examples of
self front-running, where brokers would try to create a
volatile move in underlying stocks, for example, to increase
the value of their trades in corresponding options or futures
markets.
   But investigators "are not finding anything that remotely
looks like large-scale customer front-running," said one
person familiar with the exchanges' efforts. "They are
covering every single trade of significant size. There is no
indication of self front-running either," the individual
said.
   The three exchanges have been swapping detailed trading
records since the fall of 1989 to reconstruct simultaneous
trades in stocks, stock-index futures and options by big
brokerage firms on 12 volatile days from July 1989 through
January 1990. The exchange's efforts have been closely
followed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Spokesmen for the Big Board and the Chicago Merc declined
to comment yesterday. A spokesman for the CBOT said the
investigation has not been concluded.
   The lack of hard evidence of concerted manipulation is
likely to confound a vocal anti-program trading faction on
Wall Street and many lawmakers in Washington.
   "Program {traders} are aware of the laws and are extremely
cautious," said Thomas A. Russo, veteran securities attorney
at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft. "Everybody knows that
front-running is a politicized issue," he said. "I am not
sure it's a big problem {in the market}, but it's a sexy
problem for people in the public eye."
   Allegations about program-trading manipulation reached a
fever pitch last May when James Coxon, chairman of the
investment policy committee at Cigna Corp., a big insurer,
alleged that a program-trading "club" was working on Wall
Street to roil the markets and share information. Mr. Coxon's
remarks were made before a congressional panel.
   To date, the only serious penalty by an exchange against a
program-trading firm was brought by the Chicago Board Options
Exchange against Susquehanna Investment Group for alleged
abusive trading in the stock and stock-options markets.
Without admitting or denying the allegations, Susquehanna
submitted to a $170,000 fine by the CBOE.
   Some program traders say that they have been made
scapegoats for Wall Street's larger problems. Stockbrokers
use "program trading as a convenient whipping boy" for the
retreat of the small investor from the stock market, said J.
Thomas Allen, president of Advanced Investment Management, a
Pittsburgh-based investment firm.
   Mr. Allen said that some program-trading critics have a
witch-hunt mentality. Among them, "the perception is that if
we can find the villain and kill it, then the retail investor
will be back in droves and generate that engine called
commissions."
   Now the debate may swing toward what many market observers
think is a more central problem: The difficulties U.S.
markets are having handling intensified trading demands from
large institutions, often on days when market-moving news
breaks and big investors need to trade quickly and easily.
   Such "liquidity" and market structure questions were
treated in three of eight recommendations made in June by a
special Big Board committee on market volatility.
   According to some committee members, there was an effort
by exchanges to have the group's report state that there was
no evidence that manipulation on certain days was a cause of
stock-market volatility.
   "There was an attempt to make the document reassuring to
the public that there was no conspiracy going on," said
Stephen Timbers, a panel member and chief investment officer
at Kemper Financial Services.
   However, some committee members, including Frederick L.A.
Grauer, chairman of Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors,
said they preferred to allow the exchanges to complete their
investigation, rather than endorsing what were then
preliminary, superficial conclusions.
   "We didn't want to whitewash it," said panel member James
Cloonan, chairman of the American Association of Individual
Investors.
   Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors is one of Wall
Street's big program trading customers, with $1.2 billion
committed to stock-index arbitrage strategies.
   Reached in Japan, Mr. Grauer said, "To the extent that
{manipulation} is not there, it is a positive development for
market participants. It may serve to refocus the debate on
the origins of volatility."
   However, Mr. Grauer, like the exchanges, was reluctant to
say that program trading abuses never occur. "The ability to
audit is quite limited. You are getting sample points and
making generalizations," he said. If the exchanges find the
records clean on the specific days under study, "I give the
market a clean bill of health -- on those 12 days," he said.

   SEBOKENG, South Africa -- One by one, the men from the
cinderblock hostels step forward under the towering bluegum
tree to bear witness to the slaughter of the night before.
   It was 2:30 in the morning, they all say, when gunshots
and explosions shattered their sleep in the wretched
dormitories that house South Africa's migrant workers. A
large man called Oupa says a bullet ricocheted off his metal
door. When he opened it, he saw black men with red headbands,
allegedly members of Inkatha, a Zulu-based political
organization, rampaging with spears, machetes, guns and
grenades.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An old man with a limp tells of peeking through a window
and seeing a white man on horseback firing a rifle in all
directions. A younger resident describes how the sun rose to
reveal two dozen corpses. Some were horribly disfigured by
machete blows to the face, he says. Others were both hacked
and shot. As the men regrouped to confront their attackers,
government soldiers opened fire on them. Eleven more hostel
residents fell dead.
   Anger surrounds the bluegum tree. Where, the men ask, was
their organization, the African National Congress? Where was
the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, or MK? As ANC leader
Nelson Mandela stood before them later that horrible day,
they begged for weapons. They wanted revenge.
   Instead, Mr. Mandela, himself boiling with anger after
seeing a man's brain spilling out of a crushed skull at the
morgue, appealed for calm. The savage fighting, which has
left over 700 blacks dead in the past month -- including more
than 20 killed yesterday in an attack on a train in
Johannesburg -- has bloodied his own prestige and that of the
other major peace brokers, the government and Inkatha. And it
has staggered the negotiations he has delicately nurtured
with President F.W. de Klerk.
   The ANC, Mr. Mandela explained to the vengeful men, had
suspended its armed struggle. He had no arms to give them.
Trust him, he pleaded. Trust the ANC.
   But trust is a fleeting thing in South Africa these days.
For the third time this year, the mortuary and hospital of
Sebokeng are full. March 26, July 22, Sept. 4 -- three
"massacres," as the residents here say, when the main road of
this blighted black township south of Johannesburg became
slick with blood. For the third time, Mr. Mandela came to
visit and reassure. For the third time, the people, weary of
battle, listened to their beloved leader and wanted to
believe.
   "Yes, we will trust Nelson -- for now," says Petrus
Dzanebe. But he now sleeps in his clothes, he confesses, and
with one eye open. "We live in fear," he says, "that this
will happen again, at any time."
   Should it, local ANC officials fear that Mr. Mandela
couldn't dare return to Sebokeng without weapons. Earlier
this week, even Mr. Mandela himself said the grass-roots call
for armed protection is growing too strong to resist for much
longer.
   Mr. Mandela, who has been a free man for seven months
after 27 years in prison, faces a dilemma of Gorbachevian
proportion: Wildly popular abroad, he is desperately
struggling to control the tumultuous course of change at
home.
   Where optimism for a "new" South Africa once flourished
following his release in February, dark despair now reigns.
   "We don't know where we are going,"' says Phineas
Mthimkhulu, a Methodist minister who dodged several bullets
while assisting the injured during the hostel massacre. "Are
we going up or down, left or right?" He shrugs. "Who knows
anymore?"
   Even the ANC, in an internal paper analyzing the violence,
expresses doubt. "We need to ask if South Africans are ready
to move in the direction of a new society. Are we ready to
think in a new way? Is it possible for us to talk of a new
South Africa or is it yet too early?"
   Few have remained unscathed by the violence. Inkatha, the
conservative, capitalist antithesis of the socialist-oriented
ANC, can no longer profess its peaceful innocence after more
than 100 supporters, including its regional leader, were
arrested during the Sept. 4 hostel fight.
   And the claims of propriety and impartiality by the
security forces -- who deny ANC charges that they aid Inkatha
-- are sounding ever more hollow after a judicial inquiry
ruled that police were "unjustified" in opening fire with
live ammunition on a crowd 30 yards away during the first
Sebokeng massacre on March 26.
   Less than a week after that report was made public, the
army opened fired in Sebokeng on Sept. 4. Also, eyewitness
reports of the presence of masked whites in the hostel battle
has fueled suspicions that certain elements of the white
right wing are stirring up black animosities to derail the
government-ANC negotiations over a new constitution and
black-white power sharing.
   The ugly appearance of black factional fighting, which has
crippled much of the rest of Africa, is also undermining the
efforts of the government to interest foreign investors in a
post-apartheid South Africa. Mr. de Klerk will be promoting
his reforms when he visits Washington later this month, but,
as he recently told South African businessmen, "There can be
no real reform before stability."
   The greatest damage, though, has fallen on the ANC and on
the slender shoulders of the 72-year-old Mr. Mandela. The
unceasing violence, which spreads like an infectious plague
from one township to another in the Johannesburg area, has
exposed the ANC's leadership weaknesses as it emerges from 30
years of exile and makes the transition from liberation
movement to political party.
   And Mr. Mandela's inability so far to defuse the factional
fighting has disappointed those who expected him to act more
like a statesman than an ANC cadre. Commentators here note
that his refusal to meet with Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi
as long as Inkatha "perpetuates violence" is precisely the
argument the government used in refusing to negotiate with
the ANC for three decades.
   While the ANC's hierarchy has become a partner with the
government in shaping the country's future, grass-roots
supporters are still pursuing the ANC's revolutionary
strategy of making the country ungovernable through strikes,
boycotts and mass protest. In Sebokeng, for instance, youth
leaders still refer to different sectors of the township by
their revolutionary nicknames: Beirut, Nicaragua, Cuba,
Angola, Palestine, Libya, Moscow.
   Although relative calm returned to the hostel area --
dubbed Vietnam -- after Mr. Mandela's visit, youths spent the
next few days roaming the Beirut section, blocking the
streets with boulders, hijacking cars and inviting several
clashes with police, who were quick to unleash tear gas. The
youths pointedly ignored Mr. Mandela's instruction to return
to school.
   "Give us MK," says a teen-ager wearing a floppy "Coke is
it" hat. He is sitting on one of the boulders blocking the
road. "Give us Hani." Chris Hani, the Umkhonto we Sizwe
commander, is particularly popular among the youth.
   The wave of violence began after the ANC suspended its
armed struggle on Aug. 6 in return for an agreement with the
government on the return of exiles and the release of
political prisoners. But as the killings mounted, so did
dissatisfaction and misunderstanding over the suspension. "A
desperate call for arms became deafening," says the ANC's
discussion paper. Some ANC officials, it notes, have been
reluctant to speak in the areas of unrest because they had no
answer to this demand.
   "Generally speaking, the vision of unbreakable strength
{the ANC} had nurtured and earned over the years was dented,"
says the paper. "Instead, people felt the ANC was displaying
political paralysis and had fallen prey to de Klerk's sweet
talk."
   Also dented is the ANC's decades-long struggle to overcome
the country's ethnic differences exacerbated by the
government's policies of racial segregation.
   Although the ANC's membership includes blacks from all the
main tribes, as well as whites, Indians and coloreds (people
of mixed race), the top leadership is predominantly
Xhosa-speaking. The Xhosa image became more accentuated
during the 30 years of banning as the ANC became personified
by the jailed Mr. Mandela, who is a Xhosa.
   Thus, when Inkatha, which is overwhelmingly Zulu, clashes
with the ANC, political differences are reduced, in many
minds, to a Zulu-Xhosa tribal war. Inkatha pamphlets urge
Zulus to resist Xhosa domination in any new government; ANC
supporters vow to "kill the Zulus."
   Andrew Mapheto, an official in the ANC's Johannesburg
office who wrote the discussion paper, says he was once
almost attacked because he was driving a car with license
plates from Natal province, the home of the Zulus. He also
tells of two Zulu children who were killed when the family
home was bombed. On the day of the funeral, taxi drivers
refused to transport the mourners and local youths said the
cemetery wasn't open to Zulus. The family was told to bury
their dead in kwaZulu, the Zulu homeland.
   Sebokeng and the surrounding black townships of what is
known as the Vaal Triangle have contributed two generations
of anti-apartheid martyrs. It was in neighboring Sharpeville,
in 1960, that police opened fire on a large group of
demonstrators. Later that year the ANC was banned and
Umkhonto we Sizwe was formed.
   In 1984, a protest against township living conditions and
black local government was met by police fire, triggering a
nationwide wave of unrest and repression that led to the
state of emergency and the intensification of international
economic sanctions against Pretoria.
   This year, on March 26, a few weeks before the first-ever
talks between the government and the ANC, Sebokeng residents
were again marching in protest against township conditions
when police again opened fire. More than a dozen people were
killed and 281 injured, many of them shot in the back.
   Mr. Mandela rushed to Sebokeng and the ANC postponed the
start of negotiations, demanding an independent commission to
investigate police actions. It was that commission which
labeled the police shooting "unjustified."
   On July 22, following an Inkatha rally to whip up support
in a solidly ANC area, Inkatha supporters armed with
traditional Zulu weapons such as spears and machetes clashed
with hostel residents, who are mostly Xhosa, Sotho and
Tswana. Dozens were killed and injured, and the small number
of Zulus who were living in the hostels were forced out.
   Until then, residents of the hostels say, the various
tribes had gotten along fine. After the clash, the crowded
16-to-a-room hostels were filled with mistrust and tension.
   This set the stage for the Sept. 4 predawn attack. The
night before, the police patrol that had been on duty around
the hostel since the earlier fighting was removed. This, the
ANC alleges, allowed Inkatha supporters to enter the hostel.
Mr. Mandela says that these circumstances, together with
witness accounts of white men fighting alongside the Zulus
that night, arouse the suspicion "of connivance between the
police and Inkatha." Both Inkatha and the police vehemently
deny this and reject claims they work in concert.
   In order to defuse the tribal aspects of the fighting,
which the ANC says only helps those who want to see apartheid
entrenched, Mr. Mandela told the residents of Sebokeng that
they mustn't blame Inkatha alone. Revenge against Zulus, he
said, would play into the hands of "right-wing" elements who
want to see blacks fighting blacks. He told the people to
silence their calls for weapons, because arms would only give
the police and army more reason to shoot.
   Still, tension blanketed the township. Despite Mr.
Mandela's assurances that he would hold the government
responsible for the killings, the fear of a fourth massacre
loomed.
   "Most of our people accept what comrade Mandela says, but
they are very angry and afraid," says Maurice More, the
25-year-old president of the local South African Youth
Congress branch, which is allied with the ANC.
   The telephone in his township office rings. A colleague
says police and army vans have been seen making their way to
Sebokeng. "Those of us who are activists are forced to be
vigilant, alert," says Mr. More, turning to look out the
window. "You never know what will happen."
   Over in "Beirut," the township's militant teen-agers are
manning their roadblocks, making sure nobody who doesn't
belong here gets through. Police and army vehicles
occasionally roll over the boulders, lobbing tear gas
cannisters along the way. The youths scatter. Five minutes
later, they are back, checking the traffic.
   Tear gas lingers over the Central Methodist Church,
located in the middle of Beirut. "One morning we'll wake up
and some of them will be dead," Joel January, the church
secretary, says of the youths. "I tell you, this is no life.
It isn't what we expected a couple of months ago."

   LONDON -- When it comes to publicity, British publisher
Robert Maxwell has few peers.
   Monday, Mr. Maxwell's tabloid Daily Mirror told its
readers that Mr. Maxwell might inject #12 million ($22.3
million) into Tottenham Hotspur, a top-ranked but
cash-strapped London soccer team. "#12 MILLION TO MAKE SPURS
KINGS OF EUROPE," the Mirror screamed, in a headline that
took most of the entire page.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a story emblazoned "Exclusive," Mirror sportswriter
Harry Harris said: "I can now reveal the sensational secret
moves for Maxwell to become England's mega-millionaire soccer
baron, equivalent to the game's wealthiest patrons in the
world, following in the footsteps of Gianni Agnelli of
Juventus, Silvio Berlusconi of AC Milan and Bernard Tapie of
Marseille." A photograph of a beaming Mr. Maxwell accompanied
the story.
   A day later, after suggestions British soccer authorities
might block the deal because of the Maxwell family's other
soccer interests, the Mirror assured its readers: "SPURS DEAL
IS ON]" Under another "Exclusive" label, Mr. Harris quoted
Mr. Maxwell's son, Kevin, as saying the family would sell
some of its stakes in two midranking U.K. teams if it decided
to proceed with the Spurs deal.
   Mr. Maxwell has never been coy about using his media
empire to toot his own horn. Two years ago, the Daily Mirror
serialized an authorized biography of its proprietor. The
book, titled simply "Maxwell," was written by the Mirror's
political editor and published by yet-another arm of Mr.
Maxwell's conglomerate.
   Mr. Maxwell wasn't available. But the Mirror's editor, Roy
Greenslade, cheerfully acknowledged that the proprietor "can,
to an extent, use us as a mouthpiece." But he insisted the
Mirror is merely "using our unique access. You can't avoid
the fact that he's upstairs."
   And in fact, the Mirror didn't break the story. In a juicy
journalistic irony, the Mirror was scooped on its
proprietor's own story: News of the possible investment first
appeared in last weekend's Sunday Times, owned by Mr.
Maxwell's arch-rival, Rupert Murdoch.
   But the Mirror pulled out all the stops to catch up.
Yesterday's update headline, "#12 Million Deal with Maxwell
Continues," was spread across two pages between photographs
of the previous full-page splashes. Mr. Maxwell's face smiled
from yet-another photograph.
   One angle the Mirror hasn't covered: the eyebrows raised
in London financial circles over the way talks between Mr.
Maxwell and Spurs were disclosed. The team, incorporated as
Tottenham Hotspur PLC, is listed on London's Stock Exchange.
Stock-exchange rules require companies to announce
price-sensitive information through the exchange.
   But Spurs didn't disclose the talks with Mr. Maxwell until
Wednesday. On Monday, after the Mirror's first banner
headline, Spurs's shares shot up 14% to 111 pence ($2.06).
   To complicate matters, Spurs also announced Wednesday that
Mr. Maxwell already is involved in a #1.1 million loan to the
team -- a loan some Spurs directors hadn't known about. Spurs
now is embroiled in a boardroom fight over the company's
future; a secretary at the team's office said nobody was
available.
   Amid all this theatrics, Mr. Maxwell's soccer dream may be
evaporating. Four days after the Mirror's first big banner
headline, he issued a statement declaring that he would stop
talks with Spurs unless its "unseemly board squabbles are
resolved speedily and cordially."
   Did the Mirror have any further insight into the
proprietor's about-face? Keith Fisher, the Mirror's sports
editor, said he didn't have time to discuss the matter. He
was late for a meeting . . . with Mr. Maxwell.

   It is unfortunate that the last thing Stephen Friedman of
Goldman Sachs expressed (Money &amp; Investing, Aug. 15) was a
seeming reluctance to examine speculative investment
opportunities in Eastern Europe. True, there are awesome
barriers, from the want of standard accounting systems to the
lack of a modern stock exchange and convertible currencies.
   Eastern Europe, however, is an opportunity too good for
even the conservative Goldman Sachs to pass up. It includes
about 850 million literate, mostly educated people. It is
also an area that, through stronger ties with the Soviet
Union, could become self-sufficient in raw materials,
independent of the Persian Gulf. Eastern Europe is a growth
opportunity first, a highly speculative risk second.

   DETROIT -- Sales of domestic cars and trucks gained
momentum in early September, rising 2.5% on the heels of a
weak August.
   It was the first 10-day period since late July in which
the 10 major U.S. auto makers boosted sales from a year
earlier. The modest increase surprised some analysts, who had
expected car and truck sales would continue spiraling
downward in the wake of rising gasoline prices, economic
uncertainty and growing tensions in the Persian Gulf.

   "It's as if the American consumer is oblivious" to these
economic conditions, said David Healy, an analyst with
Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "There doesn't seem to be much of an
effect on people's willingness to buy cars."
   U.S. auto makers sold 217,610 cars and trucks in the Sept.
1-10 period, compared with 212,334 in early September a year
ago.
   Sales of North American-made passenger cars rose 6.7% in
early September, to 140,795 from 132,004 a year ago. General
Motors Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp.
contributed the most to the overall gain.
   Passenger car sales in the Sept. 1-10 period hit a
seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 7,130,000 cars,
according to a Commerce Department formula. That rate is
slightly lower than the 7,290,000 car-sales pace a year ago,
and about even with the 7,110,000 cars in late August.
   Chrysler Corp. fared the worst among the Big Three. The
company's domestic car sales skidded 15.9%, while its
domestic truck sales dropped 17%.
   Ford Motor Co.'s domestic car sales were off 0.6%, despite
a 13.9% increase in sales of the redesigned 1991 Ford Escort
compact and the older version. Escort sales have been soft
much of the year. But in early August, Ford started offering
4.8% financing on Escorts, as well as cash rebates. Ford's
truck sales jumped 10.2% in the latest 10 days, largely on
the strength of its Explorer sport-utility vehicle.
   GM said sales of its domestic cars rose 6.4%. But the No.
1 auto maker's truck sales were down 13.8% from a year
earlier.
   Most of the Japanese auto makers that build and sell cars
in the U.S. continued to show gains from a year ago.
   Honda increased sales of its domestically made Accords and
Civics by a whopping 89.1%, partly reflecting increased
production. Toyota boosted sales of its domestically made
cars by 70.9%.
   Mitsubishi Motors Corp., however, saw sales of its
U.S.-built cars drop 20.7%.

   International:
   Explosion at a Nuclear-Related Facility
   Stirs Concern on Soviet Industrial Safety

   LONDON -- An explosion at a Soviet factory that makes
metals used in nuclear reactors injured several people and
underlined mounting concerns about Soviet industrial safety.
   The accident, which occurred Wednesday in the Soviet
Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, didn't release
radiation or kill anyone, according to Tass, the Soviet news
agency. It reported yesterday that "several people" were
injured in the fire, which began in the basement of the
factory's beryllium metals workshop. Beryllium is a toxic but
non-radioactive metal that the Soviets use in some of their
scientific, space and military reactors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite initial fears of a repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear accident, by late yesterday U.S. and West European
nuclear experts were classifying the explosion as a serious
but conventional industrial accident.
   Normally, there wouldn't be much radioactive material at
such a metals-forming factory; the only immediately apparent
link to the nuclear industry was that the factory's products
are used in some Soviet nuclear reactors. The plant is also
far from the nearest nuclear-testing site.
   "I wouldn't worry about it" posing any health threat
outside the immediate area of the factory, said one U.S.
Energy Department official, who declined to be named.
Supporting that view, Soviet delegates to the International
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna indicated there wasn't any
radiation danger.
   But the accident, whose cause Moscow didn't disclose,
stirred renewed concern in the Soviet capital and elsewhere
about the country's worsening record of industrial safety.
Underlining that concern, the Kremlin dispatched a deputy
atomic-energy minister to visit the accident scene yesterday,
according to one Soviet nuclear industry official reached by
telephone in Moscow.
   Tass said the fire was extinguished in about 90 minutes,
but that beryllium contamination at the site was still twice
the permitted Soviet safety level. Beryllium, when inhaled,
can cause a serious lung ailment called berylliosis.
   Since the 1986 Chernobyl accident, Soviet officials and
journalists have shown more concern about safety throughout
Soviet industry. Reliable statistics are hard to come by, but
last year the official newspaper Izvestia lamented about the
200,000 Soviet industrial deaths and injuries that occurred
in 1988, many due to careless practices, decrepit equipment,
or even poor washroom facilities when dealing with toxic
materials.
   Part of the problem, Western analysts say, has been a
paucity of comprehensive occupational safety laws or
regulations; until recently, most safety standards were split
up among the various ministries that supervised each
industry. To tackle the problem, the Soviet Academy of
Sciences recently launched a major new study of Soviet safety
methodology. And Moscow this year created one, industrywide
safety regulator. So far, there is little evidence of
improved safety, and this week's accident is likely to put
added pressure on Moscow to produce results.
   According to Tass, the accident occurred at the Ulbinsky
metallurgical plant near the city of Ust-Kamenogorsk, in the
Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. The site is about 100 miles
east of Semipalatinsk, where the Soviets conduct their
nuclear weapons tests. There wasn't any evidence, however, of
a link between the accident and weapons testing.
   With few details emerging from Moscow, Western analysts
speculated that a conventional chemical or gas explosion
might have occurred at the factory, spewing smoke and
beryllium into the air. The resulting smoke cloud was
reported drifting towards the Chinese border, 200 miles away.
   Some initial confusion was caused by Tass's description of
the plant as "a major producer of fuel for nuclear power
stations." But Soviet officials Thursday told the
International Atomic Energy Agency that the description
wasn't accurate, a spokesman for the Vienna-based United
Nations affiliate said.
   In fact, according to Soviet officials, the beryllium
produced in the factory is used to make non-fuel components
of reactors. Specifically, the material is often used as a
"reflector" inside some reactors. A reflector is a layer of
metal surrounding a reactor's radioactive core. As the
uranium fuel inside the reactor fissions to produce energy,
many high-energy particles race away from the core. A
reflector bounces the subatomic particles back into the core,
to help maintain the atomic reaction and reduce the amount of
radiation escaping.
   The big Soviet nuclear program, however, is apparently
unique in using beryllium alloys in reactors; in the West,
various zirconium-steel alloys are used. The U.S experimented
with beryllium decades ago, but it dropped the material as
too expensive and toxic. The Soviets have apparently
continued producing it for some specialized, high-performance
reactors in its space program and its military research.

   Ontario's Socialist Hiccup

   After a week of horror and dismay at the stunning New
Democratic Party victory in Ontario, businessmen in the
province are now trying to persuade themselves to look on the
bright side.
   The new premier, Bob Rae, has devoted his first week in
office to reassuring business that he does not intend to
carry out his party's numerous resolutions in favor of
nationalizing mines, banks and forestry companies; that he
will dishonor the NDP commitment to let trade union officials
vet every textbook used in the province's schools; that his
promised 60% increase in the minimum wage will be phased in
over four years; and that he does, cross his heart, believe
in a market economy -- so long as it works "efficiently and
fairly." So far, businessmen are professing to be reassured.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It takes strong nerves to be reassured about Ontario right
now. Ontario is one of the most important economic
jurisdictions in North America: Forty percent of Canada's
economic activity is done there. The Toronto Stock Exchange,
which is regulated by the provincial government, is the ninth
biggest (by value traded) in the world. Five of North
America's 20 biggest banks are headquartered in Toronto.
   Ontario also has traditionally been the bastion of what
passes for conservative politics in Canada. It was governed
by the Conservative Party for 42 years, from 1943 to 1985.
While every other English-speaking province outside the
tradition-minded Maritimes has consistently put socialists or
right-wing economic populists or both into power since 1945,
Ontario voters normally reward the party seen to be preferred
by the business establishment. Except in 1975-78, when the
Ontario Liberal Party collapsed, the NDP had never before
even managed to finish second.
   Perhaps because they have had so little experience in or
near government, Ontario New Democrats are among the wackiest
of the developed world's socialist parties. You will find no
Roger Douglas, no Helmut Schmidt, no Paul Keating, no Laurent
Fabius among them. Their economics are those of a Central
European peasant, circa 1450: They understand the world to be
governed not by neutral economic forces, but by evil spirits
-- ghouls, bankers, goblins, real-estate developers.
   Inflation, the NDP believes, is caused not by
overindulgent central banks, but by speculators; and so it
promised during the campaign to enact a 90% profits tax on
the sale of any real estate (other than a primary residence)
within four years of purchase.
   Women, the party says, often earn lower salaries than they
would like, not because they tend to choose jobs for which
the demand is relatively low and the supply relatively high,
but because of systemic discrimination; and so the party has
promised and promised again to extend Ontario's "pay equity"
program to virtually every employer in the province --
meaning that civil servants and consultants will rate every
job in the province on a scale of 1 to 400, and punish any
employer who pays a jobholder rated at 250 more than one
rated at 275. It will be no excuse that there were plenty of
people able to do the 275-point job and a desperate shortage
of people able to do the 250-point job.
   Auto insurance premiums rocket up, the party says, not
because judges are awarding more generous personal-injury
settlements, but because auto-insurance executives are
grasping and selfish; and so the NDP made a government
takeover of auto insurance one of the centerpieces of its
campaign rhetoric. Rents are high not because municipal
regulations prevent developers from constructing housing fast
enough to keep up with booming demand, but because developers
are gouging the public; and so the party has promised to
squeeze every last bit of mercy out of Ontario's already
stringent rent-control laws.
   And yet, Ontario's business community may be right to take
a relaxed view of its new government. First of all, the NDP's
radical instincts are likely to be tempered by its flimsy
mandate: Although the party took 74 of the 130 seats in the
provincial Parliament, it received only 38% of the vote. It
owes its majority in part to the flukes possible in a
three-party system, in part to the unprecedentedly high
number (7%) of ballots cast for fringe Green, Libertarian and
anti-bilingual candidates. Unless the NDP can cajole an added
4% or 5% of the electorate into voting for it next time, it
will almost certainly be swept out of power. The need to
conciliate that 4% or 5% should have a nice damping effect.
   The NDP government's operations are also going to be
gravely hampered by personnel weaknesses. Mr. Rae himself is
a highly intelligent man, if uncontaminated by any experience
outside academia and politics. Otherwise, the NDP benches are
a near total talent vacuum.
   Business can also take a certain cold comfort from the
depressing fact that it's going to be hard for an NDP
government to do worse than its predecessor Liberal and
Conservative governments. Mr. Rae is planning to tighten rent
controls -- rather than introduce them -- because controls
were first enacted by a Conservative government in 1975. It
was the Conservatives who first imposed "anti-speculation"
taxes on real estate -- in 1971. Mr. Rae's tax-and-spend
policies could hardly be much costlier than those of the
Liberals, which crushed Ontario -- the most lightly taxed
province in Canada when that party took power in 1985 --
under the heaviest taxes in North America by 1990. "Pay
equity" for companies with 100 employees or more was enacted
by the Liberals in 1988.
   And for warmer comfort, business may think of this: Mr.
Rae owes his present job to a sudden surge of anger from
Ontario's voters. Liberal Premier David Peterson called this
election, two years before he was obliged to, because his
pollsters told him he was popular. Ten days before the Sept.
7 election, he seemed to be coasting toward another majority.
Then, suddenly, Wham] his party was obliterated and he lost
his own seat.
   What happened? In a brilliant series of negative ads, the
opposition Conservatives tapped a seething public resentment
over the Peterson tax burden. The Conservative ads shook
voters loose from the Liberals. But because the federal
Conservative government of Brian Mulroney has been adding tax
upon tax since 1984, the voters decided they did not trust
the anti-tax rhetoric of the local Tories. So a decisive
plurality decided to take a gamble on Mr. Rae.
   Mr. Rae is likely to disappoint that tax-shy plurality.
When he does, some canny political entrepreneur is going to
notice that the pompous local wisdom that Canadians are more
"compassionate" -- the local euphemism for redistributionist
-- than their American neighbors is dead wrong. There is, it
turns out, a low-tax constituency in Ontario after all. The
politician who figures out how to speak to it could be
premier of Ontario for a very long time. And then, Bob Rae
may look like a necessary evil, just as four years of Jimmy
Carter prepared the way for three Republican landslides.

   DETROIT -- Negotiators for the United Auto Workers union
and General Motors Corp. have cleared away all but the
crucial issues of job security and health benefits, and could
agree to a new pact by the deadline tonight, officials on
both sides said.
   "I'd say it's 70-30 there will be an agreement," said a
UAW person close to the talks. Another UAW official said,
"We're positioned for a settlement." Bargainers have reached
agreement on wages and most other issues involved in the
talks, officials said. Whatever agreement emerges from these
talks will likely set the pattern for the UAW's talks with
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. Current contracts at all
three U.S. auto makers expire at 11:59 p.m. tonight.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Union and company officials cautioned that a final
agreement on the crucial job security and health questions
hadn't been sealed as of late yesterday evening. If the UAW's
contract expires without a settlement, the union could hobble
GM's operations with a national strike, or a series of local
walkouts.
   However, the two sides could easily extend their talks
into the weekend without much disruption of GM's operations.
   UAW officials have scheduled a meeting Monday in Detroit
for all their top local union officials. Some UAW officials
speculated the meeting was called to give them details of an
agreement, but they also said the meeting could be used to
discuss strike strategies if bargainers fail to reach
agreement.
   The pace of the talks at GM quickened markedly on
Wednesday, after GM Chairman Robert Stempel, along with
Alfred S. Warren, a GM vice president and the company's top
bargainer, met with UAW President Owen Bieber and Stephen P.
Yokich, the UAW's top GM bargainer.
   Now, negotiations are at a level where, instead of dozens
of people involved in meetings, gatherings are limited to a
handful of high-level officials on both sides.
   "We're really at a very intense time of these talks," said
a GM spokesman. "We've made a lot of progress but there are
still some hard issues to get at."
   The toughest issues surround the UAW's demands that GM
workers get virtually ironclad job and income security
guarantees. GM's current job security package is an intricate
web of provisions that allows layoffs only under certain
conditions, such as a sales slump. Idled workers get a
portion of their weekly take-home pay from a special fund.
   When funds for these programs are full, laid-off workers
can earn almost 95% of their take-home pay for up to two
years. However, massive layoffs at GM over the last three
years have drained the fund and caused workers to be paid
lower benefit levels for shorter time periods. Moreover, GM
has used loopholes in the contract to close four assembly
plants and several parts-making facilities since 1987. At
least two more GM assembly plants in the U.S. are scheduled
to close by 1992.
   The UAW has demanded sweeping changes in the current
system, and GM negotiators are understood to have proposed
boosting the levels of funding for some of the income
security programs. Perhaps more importantly, GM is signaling
it is willing to enhance pension benefits to induce workers
to retire.
   According to one analyst, GM needs about 20,000 workers to
retire or otherwise leave the company annually over the
course of the three-year agreement. That would lead to
productivity gains of about 5% a year, which would virtually
offset the amount that labor costs could increase during the
term of a new contract.
   That sounds simple. But in practice, it isn't, because
some of GM's attrition will come from outright plant
shutdowns. So UAW bargainers are pressing GM to make
substantial income guarantees to workers who are laid off,
but who aren't ready to retire or willing to move to jobs at
other GM locations.
   Meanwhile, neither the company nor the union would comment
on reports that a deal has been struck on wages. In its
initial proposal to GM three weeks ago, the company proposed
a 2% base wage increase in the first year of a three year
deal, followed by lump sum payments of 2% in each of the
following years.
   GM officials also continue to seek changes in health-care
benefits. UAW workers at GM benefit from one of the most
generous health-care plans in the manufacturing sector. GM
officials had proposed requiring UAW employees to pay for a
greater portion of their health-care benefits. Although the
company has softened its aggressive health-care proposal from
the earlier stages of bargaining, GM continues to seek ways
to cut health-care costs.
   In a related matter, GM and the Electric Workers union
extended their contract past today's deadline. A GM spokesman
characterized the extension as a normal move the Electric
Workers make to await the outcome of the UAW talks. The
Electric Workers union represents 24,000 people at factories
scattered around the country that build parts for GM
vehicles.

   Hilton Hotels Sees
   Operating Profit
   Drop in 3rd Period

   Hilton Hotels Corp. said it sees a 50% drop in
third-quarter operating profit, largely reflecting
competition from two splashy casino-resorts that opened in
Las Vegas, Nev., during the past year.
   The forecast reflects the first two and a half months of
the quarter, which ends Sept. 30. In the year-ago quarter,
Hilton's operating profit was $30.5 million, or 63 cents a
share. Net income, after a small loss on property
transactions, was $28.1 million, or 58 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Our results {this quarter} have been below Wall Street
expectations and below our expectations," Steve Krithis, vice
president and controller said in an interview from Hilton
headquarters in Beverly Hills, Calif. "The new kids on the
block . . . are having an adverse impact."
   Hilton's stock price fell $2.25 to $29.25 on turnover of
more than one million shares in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday. The shares had risen as high as
$33.125 before trading was halted pending release of the
profit forecast.
   Hilton blamed the decline largely on a reduction in
gambling revenue at the Las Vegas Hilton. Competition for big
spenders and table players has been keen from Golden Nugget
Inc.'s Mirage, which opened in November, and Circus Circus
Enterprises Inc.'s Excalibur, which opened earlier this year.
   The Excalibur has taken foot traffic from the Las Vegas
Hilton and from Hilton's Flamingo; the Mirage has greatly
increased competition for high-rollers, said Michael Mueller,
an analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc. "It's doubtful
Hilton will be able to win back as many people as they lost"
because the rivals' themed entertainment is "where the action
is," the analyst said.
   The Las Vegas Hilton, a 3,174-room hotel and casino, is
one of Hilton's most important gambling properties that, as a
group, generally accounts for 50% of the company's operating
net. Hilton said hotel profit was down slightly because of a
soft summer in New York City, a major market.
   Mr. Krithis said that hotels in other major markets,
including Hawaii, Chicago and San Francisco, "are doing
well," although San Francisco is still feeling the blow from
the October 1988 earthquake. Hilton said it is has begun
posting profits from its new Flamingo hotel in Laughlin,
Nev., which opened Aug. 1.
   At an investment conference in Las Vegas yesterday, John
J. Giovenco, Hilton's head of gambling operations, elaborated
on his reasons for selling his entire stake in Hilton's
shares late last month. He said he sold to raise funds to
cover a margin call on another stock. The Hilton stock was
his other major asset, he said.
   Mr. Giovenco's 20,000 shares fetched an average of $35.50,
or about $710,000; he paid about $948,000 to buy the stock in
late 1988. Hilton stock has fallen since its report in July
of a 21% drop in second-quarter operating profit from
casinos. The stock hit a high of $115.50 last year when
Hilton was actively seeking merger partners.

   In response to Geraldine Brooks's Aug. 16 article about
U.S. and British Troops encountering Islam:
   The Arabs and Europeans/Americans have always made for
strange bedfellows as pilots flying together in training and
combat. As a Royal Air Force fighter pilot, I was involved in
training, and trained alongside, nationals of Jordan, Oman,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar. I also spent the best part
of two years flying Omani fighters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We had one prince attending fast jet school in North Wales
who refused to rise before noon and frequently went AWOL on
London jaunts. On the other hand, when some of these same
Arab pilots did decide to "turn and turn," they proved to be
excellent combat pilots.
   There were also some tragic incidents resulting from the
Arabs' fierce pride. The fear of failure and accompanying
perceived family shame caused some alarming incidents. One
student disappeared along with the chief flying instructor
who was performing a "chop ride." The student was apparently
borderline and rather than be sent home, the price of
failure, he opted to take the jet and the instructor with him
to meet Allah.
   The Arab nations have truly been jet-propelled into the
21st century.

   Niles Thim, Who
   Violated the Law,
   Is Sentenced to TV
   ---
   He Does Own Show by Way
   Of Expiation; but It Is
   Audience That Suffers

   TUCSON, Ariz. -- After Niles Thim pleaded guilty in
January to three felony counts of selling unregistered
securities, State Judge Lawrence Fleischman contrived a
punishment to fit the crime.
   The sentence: Restitution of $9.2 million to 112
investors, a year in prison -- and a half-hour on prime-time
local television.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So it happens that "Niles Thim: Conditions of Probation"
-- originally titled "Niles Thim: How I Stole $9.2 Million"
-- is scheduled for broadcast tonight at 8:30 on Tucson's
KGUN, an ABC affiliate. It's a one-time talk show, starring
-- naturally -- Niles Thim.
   Fear not, Phil and Oprah.
   "Niles Thim" was taped last Thursday with a studio
audience consisting mainly of pensioners who lost their
savings in Mr. Thim's real-estate deals. Thanks to Mr. Thim's
attorney, Robert Hirsh, "Niles Thim" wasn't very revealing.
"This is boring," whispered an elderly investor dressed in a
plaid shirt and Sansabelt slacks. "It's one big advertisement
for Niles Thim and Bob Hirsh," said a woman. Some investors
even leave during the middle of the two-hour taping.
   When Judge Fleischman dubbed the program "Niles Thim: How
I Stole $9.2 Million," Mr. Hirsh argued that his 56-year-old
client wasn't, in fact, guilty of stealing anything; he
pleaded guilty only to selling unregistered securities, under
an agreement negotiated with prosecutors. To make Mr. Thim
appear on a television show with that title would amount to
self-incrimination and cruel and unusual punishment, Mr.
Hirsh asserted. Mr. Hirsh also disliked the original format.
Anyone who lost money in one of Mr. Thim's deals would have
been able to stand up and pound away at his client verbally,
no holds barred.
   A state appeals court sided with Mr. Hirsh and halted the
show just hours before it was first scheduled to be taped in
June. Investors who had made the trek to the TV station on
what turned out to be the hottest day in Tucson's history --
the thermometer hit 117 degrees -- left wilted and
exasperated.
   After weeks of negotiations, Mr. Thim and his attorney
agreed to do the show, but with different ground rules. The
number of investors in the audience would be limited, and
they wouldn't be allowed to ask questions. All questions
would come from the station's anchorman and a private
detective, and would have to center on the three counts to
which Mr. Thim had pleaded guilty.
   "It really messed up the format," laments the show's
producer, Michael Philipsen. "We'd rented wireless
microphones, and {the anchorman} was going to roam the
audience, just like Donahue."
   As the taping finally begins, KGUN does its best to create
a talk-show ambience. Mr. Thim, his attorney and the two
interviewers sit in a semicircle in front of a pastel
backdrop. Judge Fleischman, a former Tucson newspaper
reporter, already has explained to about 30 members of the
audience that the show intends "to educate people about what
happened, and keep them from becoming victims." The judge, an
ardent advocate of so-called alternative sentencing, has said
he also wants to "make sure Mr. Thim will learn certain
things about what his conduct has done."
   "Alternative sentencing doesn't mean you're being soft on
crime; you're just being wise with the taxpayers' money," the
judge explained before the show, citing the $28,000-a-year
cost to the state of keeping an inmate in prison. Mr. Thim
will serve his jail sentence over four years of probation,
staying behind bars from before Thanksgiving until after New
Year's Day each year.
   Before sentencing, Judge Fleischman had arranged with the
station to broadcast the show.
   "The studio here at KGUN-9 has been turned into what you
might call a satellite courtroom," silver-haired anchorman
Guy Atchley says as he introduces the program. A woman in a
green velour top and white pants stands before the cameras
and launches into a tearful tale, as Mr. Thim watches
stoically. She is the only investor allowed to speak during
the program.
   Her name is Ina Bartenslager, she is a widow, and she lost
more than $30,000 in Mr. Thim's deals, she says. "I've lived
in my home for 31 years, and now my home is up for sale. . .
. I never dreamed in my wildest dreams I'd ever lose it,
especially to you," she says, facing Mr. Thim, who shows no
trace of emotion at first.
   Later, though, Mr. Thim snaps, "I appreciate all the pain
she's gone through, but I would remind Ina she did make a
good living" investing and referring clients to him over a
25-year-period. She doesn't disagree, but she is more
concerned over her $30,000. "I need it very, very badly. More
than you," she says.
   "I know," responds Mr. Thim. Mrs. Bartenslager may
eventually get some of her money back, but not before Mr.
Thim goes through bankruptcy proceedings and can sell off his
properties.
   The money Mrs. Bartenslager lost came from a settlement
she collected after a car wreck a few years back. "Inside my
left arm here it's steel, clear on up to the socket," she
says during a break in the taping. "You know, if it was
legal, I'd go up there and smash him with it."
   Things soon get bogged down in legal procedure. Mr. Hirsh
keeps interrupting to object to questions from the
interviewers and mostly allows his client to answer only the
easy ones. When Mr. Atchley tries to grill Mr. Thim about a
limousine he used, Mr. Hirsh breaks in: "We are not here to
have Mr. Thim pilloried with accusatory questioning."
   Mr. Thim seems as smooth and rehearsed as a politician,
smiling and calling Mr. Atchley by his first name. When the
anchorman asks, "Do you consider what you did a major crime?"
Mr. Thim responds that he doesn't know what Mr. Atchley means
by "major."
   "What would you do differently?" Mr. Atchley asks.
   "Register the securities," Mr. Hirsh answers for his
client with a smirk.
   "Obviously, Guy, my judgment hasn't been perfect," Mr.
Thim adds. "I haven't been proud that it hasn't worked out."
   Prosecutors had asserted that some 600 people lost more
than $25 million when Mr. Thim took his real-estate
investment company into bankruptcy in 1987. Mr. Thim later
was charged with having defrauded the investors in a type of
pyramid scheme in which he sold them mortgages on raw land.
Mr. Thim blames his troubles on a downturn in the economy and
says he had run his business successfully for many years.
   When Mr. Atchley points out that a prosecutor had
described Mr. Thim as "a manipulative, egotistical predator
whose ultimate goal was what money could buy," Mr. Thim
simply replies: "Guy, that's the opinion of the writer."
   Judge Fleischman, meanwhile, is squirming as he stands
behind the cameras, ready to rule on each objection from Mr.
Hirsh. "I'm digging my nails in my hands at this point," the
exasperated jurist says. The audience, too, is growing testy,
particularly because they can't speak out. Several people let
out audible sighs.
   The only other person allowed to query Mr. Thim, private
investigator Jerry Goddard, is annoyed with his repeated
claims that he was merely a victim of Arizona's depressed
economy. Wasn't Mr. Thim, in fact, running a "pyramid scheme"
as prosecutors had said, the investigator asks.
   "That's clearly a Fifth Amendment violation," Mr. Hirsh
interjects.
   "That doesn't mean Mr. Atchley and Mr. Goddard just have
to sit there and eat that," Judge Fleischman says.
   "Pyramids don't last 27 years, as did my business," Mr.
Thim interjects.
   Mr. Goddard finally gives up, saying on camera that all
he's getting are "rambling unanswers from Mr. Thim."
   When Mr. Thim was sentenced, investors had hoped to see a
televised confessional. "I wish somebody would have done a TV
show like this before I pulled this dumb trick of investing
with Niles Thim," says John Krane, a retired policeman from
Cleveland. He says he lost $10,000 in one of Mr. Thim's
deals. Warren Heath, an 82-year-old retiree who lost $40,000,
says he thinks the sentence is odd, "but if it helps, I'm all
for it."
   In the end, though, the elderly crowd pans the
performance. "It's an exercise in futility," Joe Spencer, a
retired real-estate investor, says after the taping. "I don't
think anything very educational came out of it."
   KGUN is bearing the production costs of the Thim show, and
it is running without commercials. If viewers greet it no
more enthusiastically than the studio audience, they have a
jurisprudential alternative: The slapstick NBC comedy, "Night
Court," will be shown opposite it.

   In your July 25 story on agricultural price supports you
quote John Chafee saying that the honey price-support program
"has outlived its usefulness and benefits only 1% of the
nation's 210,000 beekeepers." Mr. Chafee's 1% figure may be
correct, but that 1% represents about 90% of all bee colonies
in the U.S. (the balance are hobbyists).
   What most people do not realize is that fully one-third of
all food consumed in the U.S. is directly or indirectly
dependent on honey bees for pollination. Think about it. What
would happen to this nation if one-third of all of its food
was to disappear tomorrow?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I am not being an alarmist when I say that this is
entirely within the realm of possibility. The loss of price
supports, combined with the onslaught of varroa mites, will
wipe out the commercial beekeeping industry within the next
five years.
   Instead of cutting price supports, Congress should be
increasing spending on much needed research to eradicate the
mites that will have totally destroyed all wild honey bees
within the next five years. Why should we care? Wild honey
bees are responsible for 50% of all pollination in the U.S.
The mites are also a costly threat to commercial beekeepers,
with no solution in sight.
   At a current annual cost of only $15 million to $20
million, the honey price-support program is the equivalent of
only a couple dozen of the Pentagon's infamous hammers and
toilet seats. Yes, we can import honey for cheaper prices
(Third World countries harvest wild honey), but we cannot
import pollination, nor can we afford to import one-third of
all the food we eat.

"Americans' Love of IBM Typewriters Outlasts Company's." My
secretarial career began in 1949, after learning the basic
skills in high school in an excellent commercial-arts
program. The pride and joy of our Office Practice Class was
one of IBM's "ugly black machines with red keys." Through the
years, I have used progressively more sophisticated IBM
typewriters (not swayed by the salesman but by the product),
and I would hope that you can appreciate my feeling that the
computer can never, ever produce a letter that is as
impressive as one typed on the machine that nobody can type
with.
   But error-free, correctly spelled, proportionately spaced
letters do not seem to matter any more in this fast-paced
business world. When I retire in a year and a half, my boss
says I may have this typewriter and you can bet it will be

   NEW YORK -- The dollar was hurt by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks, which hinted at a quick
move to cut interest rates upon the completion of a federal
budget-reduction accord.
   The greenback dropped an entire German pfennig in the
half-hour following the remarks in the late New York morning,
and was quoted late in the day at 1.5677 marks, well below
1.5913 marks late Wednesday. Against the Japanese currency,
the dollar dropped to 136.20 yen, down from 138.09 yen in New
York late Wednesday. That level was its worst since Aug. 1 of
last year, when the dollar ended at 135.90 yen.

   Sterling was trading at $1.8825, up from $1.8594 late

   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at

Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5680
marks, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5911 marks.
   The central banker's comments were hardly new, since they
only repeated a promise made in June to administration
officials and lawmakers eager for the cheaper money they
believe is necessary to stave off a U.S. recession.
   But the remarks caught many foreign-exchange traders off
guard, slipped as they were into a question-and-answer
session that followed House testimony on deposit insurance.
   The dollar had been mixed throughout Asian and early
European trading, and U.S. traders had entered their session
adding to long, or overbought, dollar positions, especially
against the mark.
   "You get into these situations when everyone is trading
technically," said David Gilmore, a currency analyst with
McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei. "Greenspan caught people right
in the middle of building long positions, and they had to get
out of them quickly. It's not what he said that was so
startling, but it came at an inopportune time."
   Keith Raphael, a Chase Manhattan vice president, agreed
that long-dollar positions, especially against the mark, had
set up the greenback for a fall yesterday morning.
   In addition, Mr. Raphael said, the market was "unnerved"
by Mr. Greenspan's earlier comments about U.S. banks.
   "There remain all too many problems in the banking system,
problems that have been growing of late as many banks,
including many larger banks, have been experiencing a
deterioration in the quality of their loan portfolios,
particularly real estate loans," the Fed chairman said.
   The General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget
Office had issued similar warnings this week. "It's nothing
we didn't know," Mr. Raphael said, "but when Greenspan says
it, he gives it weight."
   The central banker went on to express the opinion that the
market would lower long-term interest rates if it perceived a
federal budget agreement to be credible, enforceable and
long-lasting. Should that happen, Mr. Greenspan said he
"would assume" that the Fed would be "moving toward ease" in
its credit policy.
   At his daily press briefing yesterday, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration is "still
optimistic" for a budget pact in the next few days.
   Also helping to push the dollar lower against the yen was
selling of the mark against the Japanese currency after
support broke at 87.20 yen. The German currency later
rebounded and was quoted in late New York trading at 86.879
yen, up from 86.778 yen Wednesday.
   The dollar is often used as an intermediary in such
"cross-rate" transactions. For instance, a trader seeking to
buy yen and sell marks might initially sell marks for dollars
and then sell the dollars for yen. Such trades tend to boost
the U.S. currency against its German counterpart while
weakening the dollar against Japan's currency.
   The greenback ended European dealings yesterday broadly
weaker. The currency hadn't moved much through the bulk of
European dealings, until Mr. Greenspan's comments caused it
to skid in the final hour of trading.
   The dollar finished volatile Asian dealings mixed. It
dropped against the yen but finished well above its low for
the session. The currency was last quoted in Tokyo Thursday
at 137.65 yen, down from 138.30 yen late Wednesday.
   The dollar began Tokyo trading down sharply against the
Japanese currency, at 137.40 yen compared with 138.10 yen
several hours earlier in New York. Yen bulls predicted the
dollar would drop below 137 yen before the end of the day.
   But rounds of profit-taking beginning at mid-morning
revived the dollar, as participants locked in gains on long
yen positions.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $382.90 an ounce, up 80 cents. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.8 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $383.95 an ounce.

   DETROIT -- U.S. and Iraqi soldiers may be sweating it out
in the desert, but in Detroit it's party time.
   The 1991 model year begins Oct. 1, and auto makers are
wheeling out some of the biggest and brawniest cars in years.
There's General Motors Corp.'s Buick Roadmaster wagon, a
4,415-pound monster with a V-8 engine that gets 16 miles to
the gallon in city driving. Ford Motor Co. is pitching its
own new V-8 engines, and Chrysler Corp. is offering teasing
glimpses of a 10-cylinder super sports car called Viper.
Japanese auto makers are also revving up: Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. is introducing a new 300-horsepower turbocharged sports
car, the 3000GT.

   The cars couldn't have arrived at a worse time, as far as
the on-again off-again energy debate is concerned. With oil
conservation once again on the American agenda, the auto
makers are finding themselves accused of chasing quick
profits at the expense of saving gas. "They are emphasizing
power and options and not efficiency," says Daniel Becker, a
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "At the same time the U.S. is
becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil, the auto
makers have been backsliding on fuel economy."
   As early as today, the U.S. Senate may start considering a
bill that would require new car fleets to average about 34
miles a gallon in five years, and 40 miles a gallon or more
by the year 2001. The bill's complex formula could require
some manufacturers to hit even higher targets. The current
standard is 27.5 mpg, a figure meant to represent the average
fuel efficiency for a manufacturer's entire line of cars.
Small cars usually surpass that limit, large cars usually
fall short.
   The auto makers argue that the new targets are impossible
to meet because they are at least 20% higher than the
fuel-economy levels achieved by cars currently on the road.
Don't buy "the illusion that drastic increases in government
fuel economy standards are the answer to an oil crisis," the
car companies are saying in full-page newspaper ads. "They
are not."
   But auto makers could do better -- and have in the past.
New-car fuel economy was better two years ago than it is
today, and could improve again with some modest efforts.
Sharply higher fuel-economy standards, however, could prove
highly expensive to car companies and consumers alike. Auto
makers would have to rip up their current product programs,
which were crafted in the cheap-gas era of the late 1980s.
They would also have to build a far higher proportion of
small cars than they currently envision.
   New technology will help, but there isn't any easy
solution that will let Americans cruise around in big muscle
mobiles that get 40 miles to the gallon. Thus, many consumers
would have to settle for small cars instead of the Jeeps,
minivans and luxury cars that they have been flocking to in
recent years.
   "The largest cars would have to be very small," says
auto-industry consultant George Peterson. "In the case of
Ford, a large car would be an Escort," the company's
bread-and-butter subcompact. In Italy, average automotive
fuel economy is about 34 miles a gallon -- but 80% of the
cars on the road are subcompacts.
   The auto makers concede that, thanks to the Kuwait crisis,
fuel-economy standards will get higher, even if the proposal
before the Senate doesn't become law. The only question is,
how much higher?
   Many lawmakers haven't forgotten the last go-round in this
debate. In the mid-1970s, Big Three executives insisted they
couldn't build cars that averaged better than 14 mpg.
Congress ordered them to do it anyway. Now, many of those
same executives boast about the technical achievements that
have nearly doubled the average fuel economy of their cars.
   Still, Ford says it now costs the company $300 million to
$500 million per model for every additional one-mile-a-gallon
boost in fuel economy. And Big Three executives say they've
run out of technology to make steep gains. None of the Big
Three currently meets today's federal fuel economy standard
of 27.5 mpg. Without radical changes in car design, "we don't
know how to get to 35 miles per gallon by 1995," says Richard
Donnelly, head of GM's engine division.
   But people outside the industry have some hints. For
starters, the auto makers might reconsider the latest
consumer-driven trend to put "performance" -- speed and
acceleration -- ahead of fuel economy. "A lot of the
technology used in cars today isn't being used to milk
maximum fuel economy, but to increase driveability or
performance," says J. Dillard Murrell, who helped write an
Environmental Protection Agency study of declining fuel
economy.
   Cadillac, for example, notes that its bigger, 1991 V-8
engines get 26 miles a gallon in highway driving, one mile a
gallon more than last year's models. But GM's decision to
boost the engine's horsepower to 200 from 180 washed out a
potentially greater fuel-economy gain from changes in the
engine's design.
   Ford, for its part, decided to offer a big V-8 engine in
its Thunderbird this year for the first time in years. Ford's
goal was to have the V-8 model average 23.5 miles per gallon
in city and highway driving. The company found it could
exceed that goal by one mile per gallon, but chose not to.
Instead, it redesigned the car to make it accelerate from
zero to 60 miles half a second faster, and got about 0.4
miles less per gallon.
   "If you've got half a second improvement in performance,
you've got to give up something to get it," says J.H.
Kennedy, manager of specialty-car development at Ford.
   The auto makers remind their critics that they are simply
trying to satisfy the customer. Indeed, today's "horsepower
race" is a response to a drop in gasoline prices during the
late 1980s that put performance ahead of fuel efficiency on
the shopping list of most Americans. Sales of subcompact cars
have fallen 18% in the past year, while overall auto sales
dropped only slightly.
   Also, GM got badly burned in 1986 when it built several
radically smaller luxury cars -- Cadillacs, Buicks and
Oldsmobiles -- just as gasoline prices plunged. Sales of
those models plunged as well, idling thousands of workers and
lots of expensive machinery. Only after GM hastily made the
cars big again did sales start to recover.
   The car companies raise another point: At Washington's
insistence, they have shifted their focus from fuel-economy
to making cars safer and less polluting, and that can work
against saving gas. Making a car safer often means making it
heavier by adding steel door beams or airbag hardware. And
tuning engines to run cleaner often results in diminished
fuel economy, partly because extra anti-pollution equipment
adds weight.
   The car companies say they can't simply turn on a dime
now. Product plans are set years in advance. Thus, the auto
makers have been designing cars for the mid-1990s to meet
demand for bigger, more powerful cars.
   Consider GM's Buick Roadmaster wagon and its sister cars,
the Chevrolet Caprice and Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham. During
the early 1980s, GM expected gas would rise to $2 a gallon or
more by 1990. Production of the rear-wheel-drive -- and thus
heavier -- full-size Buick Estate Wagon was scheduled to end,
and the Caprice was to be replaced by a mid-sized,
front-wheel-drive model.
   But when gasoline prices dropped, strong sales of the cars
led GM to decide to keep them big. It invested hundreds of
millions of dollars to update the Caprice and its sibling
cars and commited two factories to build them. It took six
months just to retool one of the factories.
   Now, the new Roadmaster and Caprice are hitting the market
-- just in time for another oil shock. GM could redesign the
cars as smaller, front-drive models, but that would take
another three to five years and up to $1 billion.
   GM isn't alone in this dilemma. Of 37 North American car
plants operated by the Big Three, 29 now build cars that
average less than 27.5 miles per gallon. Like their
counterparts at GM, designers at Ford and Chrysler are
working now on models for the mid-1990s. From a
fuel-efficiency standpoint, many of these vehicles will be
only marginally more economical than current products.
   All this reflects the fact that the Big Three still rely
on mid-sized and large cars for the bulk of their U.S.
automotive profits. "GM and Ford have used large, luxury cars
as cash cows," says John Casesa, industry analyst with the
Wertheim, Schroder &amp; Co. securities firm. Giving those cars
up "could have a terrible impact on profitability," he says.
   Even Japanese firms will have trouble doing a 180-degree
turn on fuel economy. They sell lots of gas-sipping
subcompacts, and have better overall fuel economy scores than
the Big Three. But the Japanese have been invading the market
for mid-sized and luxury cars with startling success --
introducing some cars that slurp more fuel per mile than
their American rivals. Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti Q45, for
example, has a V-8 engine and averages 21.5 miles per gallon.
   Technological advances may help the auto industry lift
fuel economy. Multivalve engines, for example, have three or
four valves for each cylinder instead of the standard two,
which adds more air to the combustion mixture and thus makes
fuel burn more efficiently. A car now powered by a 2.5-liter
conventional engine could get the same performance with a
2-liter multivalve engine, says environmental consultant K.G.
Duleep. The smaller, lighter multi-valve engine would use 8%
less gasprovided the technology isn't used just to improve
acceleration, Mr. Duleep says.
   But even if GM, Ford and Chrysler put multi-valve engines
in all their vehicles over the next several years, engineers
at those companies say they couldn't meet fleet targets as
high as 35 or 40 mpg without substantially cutting the number
of large cars they sell.
   They point to the experience of Toyota Motor Corp. Its
Camry is a five-passenger, front-wheel-drive sedan that fits
the ideal car profile laid out by federal regulators. It
comes with a standard 16-valve, four-cylinder engine and an
electronically controlled transmission, and it has high
quality standards. Yet it averages less than 33 miles per
gallon.
   That's why Toyota officials moan about proposals to raise
standards to as high as 40 mpg. To hit that level, most
Toyotas sold in the U.S. would have to be tiny cars like the
39-mpg subcompact Tercel. Toyota's highly successful,
250-horsepower Lexus LS 400 luxury sedan, which sells for
$38,000, averages just 23.5 miles a gallon. "We would be an
all-Tercel company," says a Toyota spokesman.
   Moreover, blockbuster advances in fuel savings, such as
commercially viable electric cars or two-stroke engines that
get 40 or 50 miles to the gallon, aren't coming any time
soon. GM says it must solve a number of technical problems to
put its much-publicized Impact electric car on the road, even
in limited numbers.
   Vehicles powered by propane or methanol are in use in
parts of the country. But auto makers don't have the
machinery to mass-produce these cars. And it will take time
for alternative fuels to become universally available.
   Auto makers can cut the weight of cars using plastic or
aluminum instead of steel in bumpers, doors and other parts.
But these materials cost more than steel, and in some cases
entail sacrifices in appearance and durability. And in return
for higher prices, consumers would get only marginal
fuel-economy improvement -- unless cars also were made
smaller.
   But auto makers may have little choice as they reckon with
new oil prices. Chrysler recently postponed plans to build a
big rear-wheel-drive luxury car in the mid-1990s and will use
the money to develop a compact sedan instead. GM has decided
against putting a 5.7-liter V-8 engine in the Buick
Roadmaster wagon.
   Auto makers also are starting to revamp their marketing
pitches to tilt, once again, toward fuel economy. But if the
preferences of some industry observers are any guide, it will
be a tough sell in the absence of gas lines. Mr. Duleep, the
energy conservation expert, drives a 1989 Nissan Maxima, a
muscular car that gets just 19 miles to the gallon in the
city. Says Mr. Duleep: "I have to use up my share of gas
before everybody else does."

   Corroon &amp; Black shares sank yesterday amid Wall Street
speculation that Aon Corp.'s surprise bid for the insurance
brokerage firm could collapse if it's rejected by Corroon's
board.
   Analysts believe that a bidding war over Corroon &amp; Black

scenarios," said Michael Smith, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman in New York.
   Corroon &amp; Black had previously agreed to merge with Willis
Faber in a $33.49-a-share, or $703 million, stock swap. But
Aon's $40-a-share, or $840 million, proposal poses a hefty
challenge to the Willis Faber offer, which analysts believe
is favored by the board.
   In a letter delivered Wednesday to Richard Miller,
Corroon's chairman and chief executive officer, Patrick G.
Ryan, Aon's chairman, president and chief executive, had
stressed that he wouldn't pursue any deal that was opposed by
Corroon's board.
   "If Corroon's board rejects Aon's offer, Mr. Ryan could go
away," said Alice Cornish, an analyst with Northington
Partners. "It has to be a friendly deal because an insurance
broker's main assets are people. I'm sure he's well aware of
that because he has acquired other brokers."
   While there's little chance that Willis Faber will walk
away from its bid, the company said it wouldn't sweeten the
terms of its proposed merger with Corroon despite Aon's
higher bid for the New York-based broker.
   "Our position is firm. We're still working toward the
merger," said Peter Stevens, a Willis Faber spokesman. "We
have no intention of changing our minds."
   Willis Faber's resolve may be strong, but its offer lost
appeal as its stock slipped 9%. The drop sent the per-share
value of Willis Faber's merger offer to about $10 less than
Chicago-based Aon's $40-a-share cash offer for Corroon.
Willis Faber, which has about 237 million shares outstanding,
planned to issue 160 million more in the merger. Willis Faber
would need to issue another 60 million shares to expand its
share swap to match Aon's offer.
   Analysts and investment bankers said Willis Faber has been
squeezed by Aon's surprise bid of Wednesday. If Willis Faber
changes its mind and sweetens its offer, per-share earnings,
already facing dilution under the current merger offer, would
be further diluted. And if Corroon &amp; Black opts for Aon,
Willis Faber, Britian's second-largest insurance broker,
would be left without the strategic U.S. tie it is so avidly
seeking.
   "Whichever way it turns, Willis shareholders get diluted
earnings," said Julianne Jessup, an analyst at Barclay de
Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. "Willis is in a very bad
position."
   In late London trading, Willis Faber shares were quoted at
210 pence, down 21 pence on the day. Under the proposed
merger, holders of New York-based Corroon &amp; Black, the
fifth-largest U.S. insurance broker, would receive 7.8 Willis
Faber shares, currently valued at $30.83, for each of their
20.5 million common shares.
   Corroon stock slipped back $1.375 from Wednesday's big
gain, to close at $36.25; Aon shares dropped for a second
straight day since the proposal was disclosed, closing off
$1.125 at $31.875.
   "I wouldn't want to be in the position of the Corroon &amp;
Black board," said Allan Nichols, an analyst at James Capel &amp;
Co. "I've detected tremendous enthusiasm among Corroon
people; they really want to do the deal with Willis. But with
a $10 per share difference in price, there's also the board's
duty to shareholders. I think the vote is going to be very
close."
   Corroon said its board will meet next week to evaluate the
Aon offer. "We just can't dismiss an offer to purchase the
corporation," said Robert Cuthbert, a first vice president
and Coroon's chief financial officer.
   Mr. Smith at Shearson believes Corroon's board has only
two choices here: Accept Aon's offer or find a white knight
that will outbid Aon.
   Willis Faber apparently is banking on the tax-free aspect
of its proposed share swap -- against the taxable status of
Aon's cash offer -- and the vision of a global brokerage
network that would be created by the merger. The resultant
firm, Willis Corroon PLC, would be the fourth-largest
insurance brokerage in the world. Generally, a broker assists
corporate clients in obtaining insurance coverage.
   Aon, a health, life and accident insurance company, also
operates Rollins Burdick Hunter Group, the seventh-largest
U.S. insurance broker. A combination with Corroon &amp; Black
would create the fourth-largest U.S. insurance brokerage.
There would be significant overlap between the two operations
since both firms cater to medium-sized and large
corporations.
   The proposed stock swap with Willis Faber would be
attractive to Corroon's management and employees, who
together own 30% of the firm's stock. Mr. Smith at Shearson
believes "American cash has some attraction for these folks
over a piece of paper demoninated in another country's
currency." Corroon's shareholders would receive American
depositary receipts, denominated in British pounds.
   "We think the offer is superior," said Aon's Mr. Ryan in
an interview yesterday, adding that he is confident Aon's bid
will prevail.

   RTC Aide Says
   Seller Financing
   May Need Easing

   WASHINGTON -- In its struggle to sell billions of dollars
of leftover savings-and-loan assets, the S&amp;L cleanup agency
may have to loosen standards for government loans to buyers
of the properties.
   "Seller financing may have to be liberalized for some
kinds of real estate," Lamar Kelly, head of asset disposition
for the Resolution Trust Corp., told the Senate Banking
Committee. "If we don't, we won't be selling a whole lot of
raw land in Texas or vacant strip shopping centers."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With nervous bankers clamping down on credit across the
country, a government loan may be the only way for some
would-be buyers to acquire the seized S&amp;L properties. But RTC
financing simply swaps one government asset for another: If
the loan goes bad, the government gets stuck again with the
old property.
   The RTC would like to consider providing more-exotic
government financing, such as junior and senior participation
in the loans in which only senior interests would be sold in
the secondary market, a spokesman said. The RTC could even
pay private banks fees for providing financing for RTC
purchases.
   Currently the RTC generally requires 15% down, depending
on the property, and the loan must be of sufficient quality
to be sold into the secondary market within a year. Under its
current rules, the RTC may approve as much as $1 billion in
government loans for buyers, though it has only about $50
million outstanding.
   The RTC currently holds $164 billion in assets. Its $31
billion in total sales so far consists mostly of securities
and up-to-date loans. Government financing most likely would
be for its more than 8,000 parcels of vacant land, valued at
about $7 billion.
   Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) warned the
RTC against an everything-must-go sales mentality to shrink
its real estate inventory. He suggested a land bank approach,
in which the government would hold vacant land, perhaps for
years, in hopes that real estate prices strengthen. If the
RTC sold land for 10 cents on the dollar, and a speculator
turned it at a huge profit, more than Mr. Kelly's reputation
as a regulator will be at risk, the senator said.
   "There will be a war party out looking for Mr. Kelly, and
they will hunt you down," Sen. Riegle said. "You'd better
weigh that carefully."
   The RTC also said it has now sold roughly $550 million of
its $3.7 billion in junk-bond holdings. Today is its deadline
for receiving proposals from investment bankers for managing
the portfolio, the RTC said. It expects to select an adviser
in two weeks.

   British unemployment rose for the sixth month in a row in
August.
   Employment Minister Robert Jackson said the seasonally
adjusted jobless figure of 1.65 million -- 5.8% of the work
force compared with 5.7% in July -- was bad news, but higher
wage settlements could only make matters worse.
   Statistics from the Department of Employment showed
average earnings rose 10% on an annual basis in July, the
same as June but still higher than the Conservative
government's preferred level of around 9%. "The level of
unemployment is closely connected with the level of wage
settlements," Mr. Jackson said.
   "The current economic slowdown need not be translated into
high unemployment if wage negotiators pay heed to what can be
afforded," the minister said.
                                                                                                       

   MEGABUCKS FOR MEGA BORG
                                                                                                       

   The 15-year-old Norwegian supertanker Mega Borg, which
spilled tons of crude oil off Texas after exploding in June,
left owners with a windfall. Insurers, led by Norway's
Christiansans Skipassuranceforening, paid $24 million for the
wreck -- $7 million more than the estimated current value of
its identical sister ship, said the Oslo newspaper
Aftenposten. "Compared to other tanker projects since last
December, it has been a great investment. . . . there has
been a small profit for its owners," an official of Mosvold
Farsund AS, a 40% owner of Mega Borg, told Aftenposten.
                                                                                                       

   MATERNITY LEAVE IN THE EC

   Women would get a minimum 14 weeks maternity leave, with
full salary, if the European Community's latest "Social
Charter" measure is adopted. Most EC states already give
working mothers 14 weeks or more, but in many countries the
women can only draw 70% or 80% of their salary. The proposed
measure faces opposition from several countries worried about
rising labor costs.
                                                                                                       

   PROTECTING AUSTRALIA'S KOALAS
                                                                                                       

   Australian police began "fingerprinting" koalas to prevent
them being taken illegally from the wild and caged in tourist
nature parks. Frank Carrick of the University of Queensland
said police would fingerprint 65 koalas in captivity. He said
that although koala hands lack prints, their fingertips show
a pattern that researchers believe is as individual as human
fingerprints. Under the new system, wildlife rangers who
suspect a koala has been taken from the wild will check
whether its print is on record.
                                                                                                       

   SENTENCING IN SWITZERLAND
                                                                                                       

   A Swiss court sentenced two Lebanese brothers to 4 1/2
years in prison each for laundering millions of dollars
through Swiss accounts for Colombian drug barons. The court
also fined Jean and Barkev Magharian over $37,000 each but
gave them back most of $5 million that had been seized from
them. The affair, dubbed the "Lebanon Connection," has
attracted wide attention in Switzerland for bringing down
Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp after she tipped her husband
off in 1988 that a company he helped run was being
investigated in the probe.
                                                                                                       

   BARCLAY'S GERMAN VENTURE
                                                                                                       

   Barclays Bank PLC is creating a joint-venture
financial-services concern with West German retailer Hertie
Waren &amp; Kaufhaus G.m.b.H. to open outlets for its consumer
products in the German market, the bank said. Barclays said
the Frankfurt-based venture would operate out of Hertie's 62
department stores. It is expected to offer consumer loans and
to broker financial products designed specifically for the
German market.

   The Swedish Price and Competition Office adjusted its
forecasts for the country's 1990 inflation rate to 10.7% from
a previous estimate of 10%.
   The adjustment followed the release of an 11.1% annual
increase and 0.7% monthly increase in the consumer price
index for August. Gasoline and heating oil accounted for 0.3
percentage point of the monthly rise.
   "After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, considerable
increases were recorded for the international prices of crude
oil and oil products," said Ambjorn Berglund, deputy head of
the price office. In view of that, he said, his agency "has
revised its inflation projection for 1990." Mr. Berglund
added that Sweden now has the highest inflation rate in
Europe.
   In January, the price office forecast an 8.6% rise for the
year. That projection was changed in May to 10%, after the
government announced a temporary increase in value-added tax
on consumer goods, bringing the total up to 25%, from 23.76%.
The extra tax is scheduled to be lifted in January 1993.

   Icahn Wins Unit of Integrated Resources
   With Bid of $44 Million in Court Auction

   NEW YORK -- Takeover investor Carl Icahn won an unusual
auction for a key real estate holding of Integrated Resources
Inc., the formerly highflying tax-shelter company that sought
bankruptcy-law protection last year.
   In an auction in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, Mr. Icahn
outbid a partnership that includes Meshulam Riklis, another
aggressive investor, by offering $44 million for American
Property Investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By buying API, Mr. Icahn will get control of American Real
Estate Partners L.P., a publicly traded company that owns and
runs some 300 real estate properties assembled by Integrated.
Estimates of the properties' value range widely, between $300
million and $500 million. API is the general partner and 10%
owner of American Real Estate Partners.
   Both Mr. Icahn and Mr. Riklis were longtime clients of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the securities firm that helped
Integrated expand rapidly in the mid-1980s via sales of
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.
   With the collapse of both Integrated and Drexel in the
past 15 months, some of Drexel's former clients, such as
Messrs. Icahn and Riklis, are apparently poised to swoop down
and pick up some of the pieces.
   In an interview yesterday, Mr. Icahn said he plans to use
his investment in API to get "much more involved in real
estate." He said he sees "very good opportunities in the next
decade because of all the real estate for sale." When
"everyone else is getting out," he said, "that's usually the
time to get in."
   But some holders of AREP partnership units voiced fears
that Mr. Icahn would attempt to exploit his control of the
assets at their expense. They said, for example, that Mr.
Icahn as general partner might cut the current $2-per-unit
dividend that now offers investors a hefty 20% annual return.
   The holders noted that Mr. Icahn was paying three times
the market value of all of AREP for only a 10% stake plus
control via the general partnership. AREP has 1.4 million
units outstanding, valued at a total of $14 million based on
yesterday's closing price of $10 apiece, up 25 cents, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In addition, they said, the AREP structure allows the
general partner to buy and sell partnership properties,
giving Mr. Icahn in effect the right to negotiate deals with
himself or his affiliates. The holders said that could allow
Mr. Icahn to acquire some AREP properties for himself, or
sell properties to AREP, on terms favorable to himself and
unfavorable to other AREP holders.
   Mr. Icahn, based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., owns 90% of Trans
World Airlines Inc. and has been trying to sell the carrier's
assets, either in whole or in part, to get out from under its
debt load.
   Responding to the unit holders' concerns, Mr. Icahn said
investors in three other companies he has acquired, ACF
Industries, TWA, and Bayswater Realty, have done well. "My
record speaks for itself," he said. "I've never taken
advantage of the shareholders. I've always bent over
backwards to be careful with that."
   Mr. Icahn's firm, Meadowstar Holding Co., won the auction,
conducted by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III.
His $44 million offer topped a $43.5 million bid from Sterik
Co., one of whose general partners is Mr. Riklis. Sterik,
based in Auburndale, Mass., owns properties.
   Also bidding for the Integrated unit was Oppenheimer &amp;
Bigelow Income Fund I, which submitted offers of $36 million
and $40 million, each with different terms. O&amp;B Income Fund I
has sued both API and AREP, seeking to block the sale of AREP
without the consent of a majority of the partnership units.
   Integrated is trying to raise funds to pay creditors who
hold some $1.8 billion in debt. Before the auction,
Integrated had agreed to sell API to Sterik for $40 million.
One of Integrated's other principal assets is a mortgage
investment unit.
   Judge Buschman asked that any objections to the sale be
filed in court by Monday. On Tuesday, an Icahn representative
is due to be questioned in a deposition on how he plans to
capitalize the new general partner, and on his plans for
AREP. The next court hearing in the case is slated for Sept.
28.

   Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp.,
said it will lay off 350 white-collar employees Saturday in
order to make the company more competitive.
   The helicopter manufacturer said the layoffs, concentrated
in the Connecticut area, include engineers and administrative
personnel. "We decided to size the company to be leaner and
more competitive, after looking at different segments of the
business," a spokesman said. The cuts reduce Sikorsky's work
force to 11,300.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last February, the company, based in Stratford, Conn.,
laid off 300 white-collar workers as a reaction to cuts in
defense spending. Fifty hourly workers were laid off in
March, and another 50 were cut through attrition that month.
   In the second quarter, United Technologies earnings
increased 51% to $207.5 million, or $1.64 a share.
   Sikorsky Aircraft has operations in Bridgeport, West
Haven, Shelton and Trumbull, Conn., as well as Troy, Ala.,
and West Palm Beach, Fla. Its major military products include
the Black Hawk and Super Stallion helicopters.

   Philadelphia Expects
   Drop in Bond Rating
   After Loan Bid Fails

   PHILADELPHIA -- The cash-strapped city of Philadelphia
said it expects credit-rating agencies to further lower its
shaky bond ratings after it failed this week to secure $375
million in short-term loans.
   Elizabeth C. Reveal, Philadelphia's finance director, said
the city would postpone the sale of short-term notes until
state and local politicians acted to boost investor
confidence in the city's long-term fiscal health. During
Wednesday's attempt to price the tax-free notes, some
investors were demanding interest rates of about 9.5% to
compensate for the risk of default.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Elected officials . . . have got to begin saying that
they are prepared to do everything in their power so that
Philadelphia does not become insolvent," Ms. Reveal said. She
added that investors and foreign banks were unwilling to lend
Philadelphia money because of continued political wrangling.
   The city's poor credit rating didn't help. Moody's
Investors Service Inc. rates the city's bonds at the below
investment level. Standard and Poor's Corp. gives the city
its lowest investment-grade rating. Both agencies declined to
comment on pending downgrades.
   Swiss Bank Corp.'s withdrawal Wednesday of a guarantee for
$50 million of the notes also made the sale more difficult,
the city said. Swiss Bank cited unspecified unmet conditions
in pulling out.
   But Ms. Reveal maintained that Philadelphia "fully
complied" with all conditions of its contract. "The action
taken by Swiss Bank in withdrawing its commitment is a breach
of its contract with the city," Ms. Reveal said. She added
that the city may take legal action.
   Without an eventual note sale, Ms. Reveal said, the city
will run out of cash in six to 16 weeks, depending on which
accounts it can legally tap. Even with a loan, officials say
the city's $206.4 million budget deficit will cause it to run
out of cash before the fiscal year ends next June 30.
   In an attempt to bring about needed consensus, the Greater
Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce proposed a "financial
summit" of state and local officials to be held next week.

   Hopes to Gain Awareness

   TORONTO -- When Canadians tune in their favorite national
newscasts Monday night, they'll watch a father and son play
an emotion-charged game of pool. The teen-age son's plans for
university are threatened by his father's financial problems,
but the proud father is too stubborn to seek financial
advice.
   Viewers won't be watching a report on the coming recession
or a documentary on parent-teen-ager relationships. They'll
be watching a commercial, cleverly disguised as drama.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Royal Trustco Ltd. has sewn up every second of ad time on
Canada's two national nightly news programs, as well as on a
host of independent programs, for a whole week. The company
even managed to persuade the news shows to rearrange their
usual commercial formats to accommodate its ads.
   Each night next week, Royal Trustco will show a different
five-minute ad. The spots will be broken into two segments.
The first half is designed to hook viewers, so they'll stay
tuned to see how the drama works out in the second half.
   Along with the troubled father and son, there will be a
daughter who doesn't feel comfortable talking about her
mother's will, an engaged couple trying to sort out financial
differences, two sisters away on vacation talking about money
management and two brothers wondering if they can afford to
buy the family house.
   "Love, death, promises, memories and money. Watch the late
news]" exclaim ads at Royal Trustco's branches. The company
hopes the three million Canadian dollar (US$2.6 million)
campaign will bring in well-heeled clients to seek its
financial advice and banking services. The company's motto:
"Peace of mind through sound financial advice."
   The television ads, which Royal Trustco touts as "the
world's first five minute-commercial dramas" are the
brainchild of a small Alberta-based agency, Hayhurst
Communications Alberta Ltd. Lois Lockwood, the company's
senior account executive, said the ads are designed to "break
through the clutter" of normal television fare.
   "Our objective was to increase Royal Trustco's awareness
significantly," Ms. Lockwood said. With the news shows, "the
audience is already there, and they match our demographic
target."
   Hayhurst, which beat out large, established Toronto
agencies for the job, its first national account, has a lot
on the line. Its compensation is tied directly to how well
the ads do. If consumer awareness of Royal Trustco goes up,
so does the agency's fee. If the ads fail, Hayhurst is left
with just enough to cover its costs.

   Rolls-Royce PLC, the British airplane engine manufacturer,
reported that pretax profit for the first half rose 14% to
#115 million ($214 million) from #101 million, as buoyant
demand offset the impact of a turn-of-the-year strike.
   The results fell below market expectations, which ranged
between #120 million and #130 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales advanced 42% to #1.59 billion from #1.12 billion a
year earlier.
   Earnings per share, however, slipped 2% to 9.9 pence from
10.1 pence because of the larger number of shares in issue in
the latest period.
   Rolls-Royce, riding a boom in aircraft orders that has
seen earnings improve throughout most of the industry,
benefited during the latest period from a full six-month
contribution from NEI, the engineering company it acquired
early last year.
   "The order book currently stands at a record level of more
than #6 billion and the company continues to gain market
share," Lord Tombs, Rolls-Royce chairman, said.

   Automatic Data Processing Inc. said it expects
"double-digit" growth in earnings for fiscal 1991, despite a
"modest increase" in revenue.
   Josh Weston, chairman of Automatic Data, projects the rate
of growth in per-share earnings in "excess of 10%," but said
"it's unlikely that it would go up 15% or more."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fiscal 1990, ended June 30, the company earned $211.7
million, or $2.88 a share, on revenue of $1.71 billion.
   In a meeting with securities analysts, the company said
revenue isn't expected to rise as much as earnings, growing
moderately at a rate of about 3%. Nevertheless, the company,
based in New York, said it is being aided by a lower tax rate
because of its increased investments in tax advantaged
marketable securites. That will help push earnings to "record
levels," Mr. Weston said.
   Mr. Weston said also that he expects double digit growth
for earnings in the current first quarter. In fiscal 1990
fourth quarter, the company earned $59.7 million, or 81 cents
a share, on revenue of $425.8 million.
   Automatic Data Processing provides data processing for
employer services such as payroll, brokerage transactions and
automative dealerships.

   CHICAGO -- The debut of Globex, the automated after-hours
futures trading system being jointly developed by the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC, has been
delayed until at least the 1991 first quarter.
   The system, which has been beset by a number of launch
delays, was to have begun operating by year end, according to
the partners' previous estimate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest delay results from the need for continued
testing of the complex computer system. Also slowing Globex
is the complicated process of integrating Chicago Board of
Trade financial futures contracts with the Merc contracts
originally included in Globex.
   The two futures exchanges had been developing rival
systems, but in May the Board of Trade agreed, in effect, to
fold its system into Globex. At that time, the launch date
was the end of 1989.
   Globex and an automated foreign-exchange trading system
being developed separately by Reuters called Dealing 20002,
whose start-up has also been delayed, are based on some of
the same computer hardware and software, a Reuters spokesman
said. But he said the delays in the two automated trading
systems aren't related.

   TOKYO -- High demand pushed August steel production in
Japan up 4.3% to 9.1 million metric tons, compared with
year-earlier levels, but the output was down 0.5% from the
previous month, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. A
metric ton is about 2,204.6 pounds.
   While seasonal energy conservation measures brought August
output down from the previous month's total, a spokesman said
the federation doesn't expect the rise in crude-oil prices
that followed imposition of United Nations sanctions on Iraq
to affect production.

   A New Jersey engineering firm sued the Iraqi government in
what is apparently the first attempt by a U.S. litigant to
claim a portion of Iraq's frozen assets.
   In its complaint filed in federal district court in
Washington, Consarc Corp. of Rancocas, N.J., and its British
subsidiary seek $62 million in actual and punitive damages
resulting from the collapse of an $11 million transaction to
supply Iraq's Ministry of Industry and Minerals with several
industrial furnaces. Consarc charged that the deal came apart
because Iraq "misrepresented" the purpose for which the
equipment was being bought.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Iraqis certified early last year that the furnaces
would be used to make artificial limbs for victims of the
Iran-Iraq war. Last June, however, U.S. authorities blocked
the shipment because of suspicions that the ovens could be
used instead to fabricate parts for nuclear devices. The
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait later prompted President Bush to
freeze all U.S. transactions with Baghdad, including that for
the Consarc furnaces.
   The Treasury Department indicated that Consarc is the
first U.S. business or individual to be given a license to
seek recovery of Iraqi assets. All such litigants require the
permission of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets
Control.
   The Consarc suit also named the state-owned Rafidain Bank
Iraq; Pittsburgh National Bank, a unit of PNC Financial
Corp.; and the Royal Bank of Scotland as defendants. Rafidain
holds blocked accounts relating to the Consarc contract in
New York and London, while the Pittsburgh and Scottish banks
handled letters of credit related to the financial
transactions, according to the suit. Officials of Pittsburgh
National Bank said they hadn't seen the suit and declined to
comment. Royal Bank of Scotland couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Consarc's British subsidiary, Consarc Engineering Ltd.,
was to have supplied part of the aborted Iraqi order.
   It isn't known whether Iraq will contest the suit. The
Iraqi Embassy didn't answer telephone calls yesterday.
However, shortly after the U.S. froze the Consarc shipments,
Ambassador Sadiq Al-Mashat said the U.S. suspicions were
"completely without basis."
   Consarc could win its case by default if the Iraqis choose
not to respond to it, said lawyers familiar with the
complaint.

   COURT OVERTURNS BAN on selling book about Israeli
intelligence service.
   The appellate division of the New York Supreme Court
yesterday lifted an order barring St. Martin's Press from
selling "By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a
Mossad Officer." The book was written by Victor Ostrovsky,
who is now in hiding in Canada and claims he spent two years
as a Mossad agent.
   Earlier this week, State Supreme Court Justice Michael J.
Dontzin signed an order temporarily halting the sale of the
book and ordered the New York publishing house to recall
approximately 18,000 copies that had already been shipped.
   A four-judge appellate panel ruled that the Israeli
government had failed to demonstrate that the lives of its
agents would be endangered by the book's publication.
   The Israeli government "has failed to overcome the heavy
presumption against prior restraint on publication," the
panel wrote. The panel noted that the distribution of the
book to 1,500 wholesalers, as well as to book reviewers at
major publications, meant that the order would be
ineffective.
   David N. Kaye, a lawyer for St. Martin's, said that the
company immediately began shipping copies of the book to
stores yesterday, and that there would shortly be 150,000
copies in print.
   Jonathan Lerner, a lawyer for the Israeli government, said
it is unlikely his client will seek a further review. But he
said Israel may pursue an action seeking damages against St.
Martin's.
   "If St. Martin's knew, or should have known, that Mr.
Ostrovsky was under contract not to publish any secrets, then
the proceeds from the publication of the book should go to
the Israeli treasury," said Mr. Lerner, a lawyer with the New
York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.

   SUIT FILED AGAINST ELI LILLY makes allegations about
Prozac.
   The son of a man who killed eight people sued Eli Lilly &amp;
Co., the maker of the anti-depressant drug Prozac, which his
father was taking. In the suit, James Thomas Wesbecker
alleged that Lilly failed to test properly Prozac and should
have known that it was unsafe for use for the treatment of
depression.
   Joseph Wesbecker entered the Standard Gravure printing
plant on Sept. 14, 1989, killed eight people and wounded 12
before killing himself. Mr. Wesbecker, on medical leave from
the Louisville, Ky., company, was on Prozac for five weeks
before the shootings.
   The law suit, filed in Jefferson Circuit Court in
Louisville, is among the first to blame criminal behavior on
Prozac, widely acclaimed as an especially safe and effective
anti-depressant. Other defendants in the case include Dista
Products Co., a unit of Lilly, and Mr. Wesbecker's former
psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Coleman. Five other parties involved in
the Wesbecker shootings have filed suits against Mr.
Wesbecker's estate, Lilly and others. A one-year statute of
limitations will expire today.
   A number of lawyers recently have started trying to use
what they are calling a Prozac defense to prove that the drug
made their clients commit murder and should not be held
responsible, said Michael O'Brien, director of research for
the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, a Los Angeles group
established by the Church of Scientology that wants Prozac
removed from the market.
   Last week, for example, a Utah judge ordered Joseph
Charles Gardner to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to
determine whether he was influenced by Prozac when he fatally
shot Janice Fondren last July, said Alan D. Boyack, the St.
George, Utah, lawyer representing Mr. Gardner.
   The suits have been sparked by a report in the February
issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry by Martin
Teicher, a Harvard University psychiatrist. The article
identified six people who developed violent suicidal thoughts
while taking Prozac. None had previously experienced such
thoughts, the article reported.
   Edward West, a spokesman for Indianapolis-based Lilly,
said more than 11,000 people participated in clinical trials
of Prozac, which was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in 1987, and more than two million patients
world-wide have been treated with the drug.
   "Unfortunately, assaultive behavior is common in our
society. Mr. Wesbecker had a lengthy history of psychiatric
disturbance, including suicide attempts and homicidal
threats, prior to taking Prozac. Other drugs were found in
Mr. Wesbecker's blood following his death," Mr. West said.
Dr. Coleman couldn't be reached for comment.
   Plaintiffs' lawyers acknowledge it is difficult to
determine whether Prozac or their clients' underlying mental
problems caused their behavior. But Leonard L. Finz, the
lawyer for Mr. Wesbecker's son, said that despite Mr.
Wesbecker's psychiatric history, he had never committed acts
of violence prior to taking Prozac.

   PUBLISHERS TEAM UP in case involving unauthorized
anthologies.
   The trial, which pits eight of the biggest U.S. book
publishers against Kinko's Graphics Corp., a photocopying
chain, began this week. A decision in the closely watched
case before federal Judge Constance Baker Motley in Manhattan
could clarify the legal use of copyrighted material for
educational purposes.
   At issue is the growing business of photocopying excerpts
from college textbooks and then compiling them in customized
versions to be sold to a professor's class. As a result, the
professor can assign chapters from several sources without
requiring students to buy each book.
   Kinko's, a 520-store chain based in Ventura, Calif.,
defends its service as a practical way to meet students'
educational needs. The publishers, however, seeking to
protect their $2 billion-a-year college-textbook market, want
Judge Motley to rule that such anthologies violate the
copyright law and should be banned.
   The plaintiffs are Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc.,
McGraw-Hill Inc., Penguin Books U.S.A. Inc., Prentice-Hall
Inc., Richard D. Irwin Inc., William Morrow Co., Basic Books
Inc. and John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.
   Both the publishers and Kinko's "are in a marketplace
competing for student dollars," said Ronald Rauchberg, an
attorney for the publishers, in opening arguments earlier
this week. "The plaintiffs do it with respect for the
copyright laws, paying royalties to the authors who create
these books. Kinko's doesn't do it that way."
   Kinko's says it's merely following the practices that have
been prevalent on college campuses for years and accused
publishers of trying to gouge students.
   "It would cost a fortune for a student" to buy all the
textbooks used in one anthology," said Dean Olds, an attorney
for Kinko's, in his opening statement. "If {the court's
decision} deprives the students of this smorgasbord of
sources . . . their educational process is going to suffer."

   THE TEAMSTERS HAVE RETAINED a new lawyer.
   Brendan Sullivan of the Washington law firm of Williams &amp;
Connolly has been tapped by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, according to people familiar with the union.
   For the past two years, the Teamsters union, the nation's
largest union, has been represented by lawyers at the New
York law firm of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander &amp; Ferdon.
The firm has challenged the government's authority to oversee
union affairs under the terms of a 1989 settlement of
racketeering charges brought by the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan.
   But in recent weeks, say Teamsters insiders, Teamsters
President William J. McCarthy has expressed dismay over the
law firm's failure to win on any of its motions involving the
settlement. Other members of the Teamsters executive board
pressured Mr. McCarthy to replace Mudge Rose when it became
public that the union paid the firm nearly $6 million,
according to people familiar with the change.
   Mr. Sullivan has represented Oliver North. Williams &amp;
Connolly represented former Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa,
as well as former United Mine Workers President Tony Boyle,
who went to prison for the murder of a man who challenged his
leadership.

   FORMER MONEY MANAGER Peter Jeffer pleaded guilty to one
count of wire fraud in connection with an alleged
insider-trading ring. He was accused of trading on
information he received from Steven Glauberman, a former
associate at Skadden Arps. Mr. Jeffer, who is cooperating
with prosecutors in the case, entered his plea before Judge
Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in federal court in Manhattan. Mr.
Glauberman pleaded guilty to three insider-trading-related
counts Wednesday.

   A THIRD OFFICER of a New Jersey company pleads guilty to
bank fraud.
   Richard Bober, former vice president, secretary and
director of Coated Sales Inc., pleaded guilty in federal
court in Newark, N.J., to charges involving a fraud scheme
that netted him $12 million.
   Mr. Bober admitted that he and other officers of the
defunct textile converting company lied about the amount of
the company's assets to secure a $52 million restructuring
loan from BancBoston Financial Co. He also admitted to
violating U.S. securities laws.
   Martin Greenberg, Mr. Bober's attorney, said, "Mr. Bober
is anxious to have this matter put behind him and is
cooperating with the government."
   Shortly before Coated Sales filed for bankruptcy-law
protection in June 1988, it was considered one of the
fastest-growing companies traded on the over-the-counter
market, according to U.S. attorney Michael Chertoff.

   Italy's Fiat S.p.A. agreed to buy a 60% stake in Spain's
troubled Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A., or Enasa.
Fiat will put up 12 billion pesetas ($120 million) in new
capital, plus 1.2 billion pesetas in cash for the truck
maker.
   The agreement by Enasa's owner, Instituto Nacional de
Industria, comes as a surprise; as recently as this week
Spanish officials had been discussing a possible accord to
sell Enasa to West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG. Negotiations
had foundered on the Daimler's insistence on big cuts in
Enasa's work force and hefty Spanish government grants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fiat has agreed to keep on Enasa's entire 5,700 work
force, to retain the use of its Pegaso brand for trucks and
buses and to expand into new activities in Spain, INI
officials said.
   INI will retain a 40% stake in Enasa and provide 8 billion
pesetas in new capital; both partners' contributions will
total 20 billion pesetas in increased capital for Enasa by
early next year.
   Fiat officials said they have agreed to spend about 40
billion pesetas over the next few years on new industrial
projects in Spain. Fiat also said that it has an option to
buy INI's 40% stake in Enasa in six years' time.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A federal judge here tentatively held
that victims of last year's Prince William Sound oil spill
must first seek compensation from a special administrative
oil-spill fund before trying to press their claims in court.
   The thought that the massive civil litigation stemming
from the March 1989 wreck of the Exxon Valdez could be put on
hold caught attorneys on both sides of the case off guard and
prompted harsh words from plaintiff attorneys that the ruling
could delay full resolution of the case for years more.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judge H. Russel Holland said he considered the proposal a
way of speeding up compensation to victims of the spill. The
Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act fund provides $100
million to oil-spill victims without requiring them to prove
any wrongdoing. The fund, which recently was amended by
Congress in a partial attempt to speed compensation to
victims, is financed through levies on owners of crude
passing through the Alaskan pipeline.
   "If those who have suffered monetary losses are allowed to
proceed in state or federal court with classic common law
litigation without first exhausting the fund's administrative
payment procedures, the congressional purpose of
expeditiously providing adequate compensation to all those
injured . . . would be thwarted," the judge reasoned.
   But plaintiff attorneys argued that actual damages dwarf
the amount contained in the fund and that stalling inevitable
court proceedings to recover the difference would only delay
just compensation to victims. They said haggling over
pro-rata shares to victims, as the fund requires if damages
are found to exceed the $100 million fund limit, could take
years.
   "If there is going to be litigation, why stay it now and
then rev it up again when the claims are becoming stale and
memories are fading?" asked Lloyd B. Miller, an Anchorage

   Manpower PLC said it agreed to sell five U.K.-based
subsidiaries to Brook Opportunities Ltd. for about $200
million. The employment and financial-services concern said
it also will receive 15% of the voting share capital of
Brook, a company formed to acquire the units.
   Included in the sale would be non-Manpower brand
operations: Brook Street Bureau, Blue Arrow Personnel
Services, Extrastaff, DP Support Services, and IPS Group, all
of which provide employment services. The sale essentially
would complete the disposal of companies that constituted the
Blue Arrow Group before it acquired Manpower Inc. in 1987. On
June 4, Manpower, which is reincorporating in the U.S., sold
a group of six non-Manpower units in the U.S. for $46
million.

   Cash proceeds of the sale would be used to retire Manpower
debt outstanding. The sale must be approved by Manpower
shareholders at a special meeting early next month in London.

billion annually for projected spending in 1991 and 1992.
   Andrew C. Sigler, chairman and chief executive officer,
said in Stamford, Conn., "we have nearly completed the group
of major projects we announced several years ago, and with
the likelihood of a softer economy ahead, this was a logical
place to defer the other three projects."

   The projects being deferred involve the planned conversion
of the company's brown paper mill in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., to
a white paper mill, the installation of an additional

construction of a new pulp mill in Brazil.
   Champion is a paper, plywood and lumber company.

   Bonn and Moscow
   Agree on Economic
   Aid to the Soviets

   BONN -- West Germany and the Soviet Union signed a 20-year
friendship treaty that forms the framework for broad West
German economic assistance for the shattered Soviet economy.
   Separately, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
confirmed that his government is giving Moscow an
interest-free loan of 3 billion German marks ($1.9 billion)
to cover the skyrocketing costs of maintaining whatever
Soviet troops remain in East Germany over the next four
years. The Soviets have agreed to pull all their troops out
of East Germany by 1994.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   West German officials see the loan, which is to be paid
out in installments, as a necessary part of the aid package.
Since July, when East Germany adopted the West German mark as
its own currency, Moscow has found it difficult to meet the
costs of keeping forces there.
   The new loan comes on top of 12 billion marks that Bonn
has already agreed to pay directly to help cover the costs of
removing the troops from East German territory. In addition,
West Germany will pay one billion marks in interest costs on
the 3 billion-mark loan -- making the nation's direct
contribution to the pullout 13 billion marks.
   "It's a considerable extra burden on the budget," Mr.
Waigel told reporters. However, he added, it "should be
viewed in the context of German unification."
   Mr. Waigel also spelled out, for the first time, where the
12 billion-mark handout would go: 7.8 billion marks for the
construction of new housing in the Soviet Union for returning
forces; 3 billion marks for underwriting Soviet costs inside
East Germany; 1 billion marks for transporting the troops
home; and 200 million marks for retraining those Soviet
soldiers who will be put out of work.
   While Bonn's financial inducements may have helped to ease
Soviet objections to German unity, the payments also
illustrate where West Germany is focusing its international
energies. "We view helping the Soviet economy as part of our
contribution to maintaining European stability," says one
West German Foreign Ministry official.
   More important, though, is that the new links are
guaranteeing a unified Germany a front-row seat in any
economic revival of the Soviet Union. Indeed, a close look at
the new agreements between Bonn and Moscow shows that the
ultimate result is likely to be tight economic links of a
sort not seen since the days of the czars, when German
businessmen were active in most sectors of the Russian
economy.

   General Motors Corp. said it is recalling about 30,700
1990 model vans and school buses for fuel hose defects that
could cause engine fires.
   GM is "investigating one report of a fire in a van to see
if it's related to this condition," a company spokesman said.
The spokesman said GM isn't aware of any engine fires
involving the school buses or any accidents or injuries
resulting from a faulty fuel hose.
</LP>

   The recall includes about 29,000 Chevrolet Astro and GMC
Safari vans with 4.3-liter or 2.5-liter engines, and nearly
1,700 Chevrolet and GMC school buses equipped with 366 V-8
gas engines. GM said a faulty hose could leak gasoline, and
that could result in a fire under the hood.
   Detroit-based GM said it is notifying owners about the
recall by mail. Dealers will make repairs at no charge, the
company said.

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted to liberalize trade with
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and tighten curbs on
shipments of goods that could be used to manufacture missiles
and nuclear and chemical weapons.
   The bill included trade benefits to the Soviets and
Eastern Europeans approved by the Senate Banking Committee
earlier this summer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bill would effectively give the Pentagon the right to
review shipments of certain sensitive goods to certain
nations. The Pentagon doesn't have the authority to screen
exports sent to non-Communist nations.
   The House has passed a reauthorization bill somewhat more
generous to U.S. high-technology exporters than the Senate
version.
   The Senate bill, which would renew the Export
Administration Act for two years, also would empower the U.S.
to impose trade sanctions on nations and companies that
violate international prohibitions on chemical warfare. The
current export law expires Sept. 30.
   A provision by Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.) would
increase penalties for violations of the trade embargo
against Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The civil fine would
be raised to $250,000 from $10,000, and the criminal fine to
$1 million from $50,000.
   The Senate also adopted an amendment by Sen. William Roth
(R., Del.) that would deter the State Department from
arbitrarily adding goods that are no longer controlled on
national-security grounds to its own munitions list.
Exporters have complained that the list is too restrictive.

   Smokeless Soviets Say `Da' to Philip Morris and RJR

   The Marlboro Man is riding to the rescue of Mother Russia.
And Winston isn't far behind.
   To help alleviate the Soviet Union's worst cigarette
shortage in decades, Philip Morris Cos. and RJR Nabisco Inc.
have been asked by Moscow to supply 34 billion cigarettes,
the largest export order in either company's history. In
exchange for providing the smokes, the companies will receive
a combination of hard currency and barter items.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Philip Morris wouldn't comment, analysts said the
agreement -- which calls for the company to supply 20 billion
smokes by year end 1991 -- could add between $50 million and
$100 million in operating profit to its international tobacco
business, which earned $1 billion last year. The value to
RJR, which will supply about 14 billion cigarettes by
September 1991, is expected to be about $40 million in
operating profit. RJR, which is controlled by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., declined comment on that. Last year, RJR's
operating profit from tobacco exports totaled $328 million.
   This summer, Soviet leaders have been trading blame for
what triggered a shortage of some 50 billion cigarettes --
one of numerous shortages of consumer goods caused by the
chaos of a shift to a market-based economy and away from
central planning.
   Also, political difficulties in the Baltic republics have
resulted in shortages of cigarette filters, leaving Soviet
factories unable to produce enough cigarettes. Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov has previously said the gap wasn't the fault
of the central government but of provincial mismanagement. He
also blamed panic buying.
   The Soviet government approached Philip Morris and RJR,
along with a number of other foreign concerns, about two
weeks ago. The Kremlin acted through the U.S. Commerce
Department after the cigarette crisis prompted street riots.
The collective Russian nicotine fit has been taken so
seriously by authorities that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev recently fired a government minister who oversees
the industry.
   The deal gives both Philip Morris and RJR hitherto
unimaginable access to the man on the street in the world's
third largest tobacco market, with 70 million smokers.
   Until now, Philip Morris's Marlboros and other brands have
sold at a substantial premium in Russia, where they have only
been available in duty-free and hard-currency shops. The
company had been exporting 10 million cigarettes a month -- a
figure that will now jump to one billion. RJR said it
couldn't provide a precise estimate of its previous exports,
terming them "small."
   "This is a major step to letting foreign cigarettes be
sold in normal cigarette kiosks," a Philip Morris spokesman
said. Added an RJR spokesman: "We think our American-blend
cigarettes will be very popular there -- this is a wonderful
opportunity for us."
   Although pricing hasn't yet been set, the foreign smokes
are expected to be priced above Soviet cigarettes, which
typically sell for about 45 kopeks (72 cents) per pack. But
they are expected to be priced below their current premium
levels. In the wake of the summer shortage, Soviet news
reports said that a pack of Marlboros would bring up to 20
rubles ($32) on the black market in Moscow.
   RJR wouldn't discuss pricing, terming the subject
"proprietary at this time."
   But if Marlboros are coming, Madison Avenue isn't. The
Soviet Union doesn't allow media or billboard advertising,
though it does permit a very limited amount of point-of-sale
ad displays and some sponsorship. Although Philip Morris has
done neither until now, the company spokesman said that "if
there is any, it will be very limited point-of-sale telling
the Russians these cigarettes are available."
   A RJR spokesman said the cigarette deal yesterday "all
happened so fast that we're not sure yet how we'll be
marketing it."
   Analysts reacted enthusiastically to both deals. "This is
a footstep into a huge potential market," said Diana Temple,
an analyst at Salomon Brothers. Soviet smokers puff 400
billion cigarettes annually.
   "This will sap up a lot of capacity which is created by
declining consumption in the U.S.," added Marc Cohen of
Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. "To the degree this Russian
business is attractive and representative of growth that
companies can find overseas, it's going to be constructive
for the fundamentals of U.S. tobacco makers."
   In another move that bolsters Philip Morris's presence in
Eastern Europe, the company recently bought the largest East
German cigarette factory. The transaction, which will be
completed in October, will give the company 40% of the East
German market.
   Beyond the 20 billion smokes, Philip Morris will continue
to supply "significant quantities" of cigarettes to the
Soviet Union from 1992 to 1995. The company will also help
the state agencies of the U.S.S.R. and the Russian Republic
to develop the Soviet cigarette industry.
   For its part, RJR earlier this year signed an agreement
with the Uritsky cigarette factory in Leningrad to begin
producing Winston cigarettes by early 1991.
   In an effort to calm jittery Russians until the foreign
cigarettes arrive, government officials have undertaken some
stopgap measures. City authorities in Moscow recently
imported two million packs of Bulgarian cigarettes. They sold
out in a morning.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices tumbled in a sell-off linked to
nervousness about today's flurry of economic reports and
frustration with the drawn-out negotiations on a federal
deficit reduction package.
   Reports that Iraq had issued a warning to U.S. officials
about possible terrorist attacks against American targets
unsettled the market as well, traders said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You've got an event-driven market where everyone's really
concerned about the next move overseas," compounding fears
about the domestic situation, said Larry Greenwald, a block
trader at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 43.07 to 2582.67
-- its sharpest decline since Aug. 23 -- as stocks buckled
under the weight of broad-based selling. Decliners topped
advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,009 to 430.
   Broader indexes weren't hit quite as hard as the
industrial average, but nonetheless dropped sharply. Standard
&amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index, for example, went down 3.89 to
318.65; its 1.21% drop compared with a 1.64% decline in the
Dow Jones industrials. The New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index dropped 1.93 to 175.16 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index fell 3.41 to 295.39.
   Meanwhile, the lackluster pace of trading over the past
two weeks remained intact despite the market's retreat.
"There's just very, very little to do, and it's obviously
frustrating," said Thomas R. Walsh, head of equity trading at
Nikko Securities International.
   Big Board volume amounted to 123,370,000 shares, down from
Wednesday's total of 129,890,000 shares.
   A flurry of sell programs resulting from stock-index
arbitrage hit the market during the afternoon, contributing
to its downturn, traders said. The programs took effect as
stock-index futures went down faster that the cash indexes,
creating opportunities to profit by purchasing futures
contracts and selling baskets of stocks.
   Four major economic reports are scheduled for release
before trading opens today, with the August producer price
index drawing most of the market's interest. The PPI
represents the first piece of inflation data affected by the
surge in oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The index is expected to be up 1.4% for the month,
according to a consensus forecast of economists surveyed by
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. But analysts believe the
market may pay closer attention to an index of prices
excluding food and energy, expected to rise 0.3% for August,
because a surge in the overall index is being anticipated.
   Rao Chalasani, a technical analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp;
Turben in Cleveland, said the market's fall may already have
discounted the possibility of a disappointment in the report.
"It just has to continue," he said of the market's
low-volume, sideways movement.
   August reports on retail sales, industrial production and
capacity utilization are also on the schedule for this
morning.
   As for the deficit-reduction talks, traders said the
inability of negotiators to complete a budget package has
begun taking a toll on the market. "Most people were
enthusiastic that they would have that {agreement} settled by
the end of this week. That doesn't seem to be the case any
more," said Mr. Walsh of Nikko Securities.
   Money-center bank issues were hit with selling as the
market absorbed congressional testimony from Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the banking system is
facing "all too many problems" as the quality of loan
portfolios at many banks continues to deteriorate.
   Chase Manhattan, which fell 1/2 Wednesday in the wake of a
poorly received sale of $200 million in notes, lost another
3/8 to 16 3/4. Among other money-center issues, Citicorp fell
1/4 to 17 3/8, J.P. Morgan eased 1/2 to 32 1/8, BankAmerica
lost 5/8 to 21 3/4 and Manufacturers Hanover tumbled 1 1/4 to
25 5/8.
   Digital Equipment dropped 2 3/8 to 59 1/4 in composite
trading of 1.3 million shares, extending a sell-off
attributed to disappointment with presentations at two
investment conferences earlier in the week and subsequent
reductions in several analysts' earnings forecasts. Over the
past three sessions, the stock has lost a total of 5 5/8
points, or 8.7%.
   John B. Jones, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, said
Digital's presentation at a conference hosted by his firm
"didn't leave a lot of hope for a quick turnaround,"
according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.
   Meanwhile, Dean Witter Reynolds lowered its projection of
Digital's fiscal 1991 earnings by $1.05 a share, to $5.15 a
share.
   International Business Machines, a strong performer in
recent sessions, skidded 2 7/8 to 105 on 1.1 million shares.
Other blue chips that fell sharply included United
Technologies, which tumbled 1 3/4 to 47 7/8; Coca-Cola, which
dipped 7/8 to 41 1/4; and Eastman Kodak, which lost 1 1/8 to
40 3/8.
   Hilton Hotels, which forecast that its third-quarter net
income from operations would be about 50% lower than a year
earlier, fell 2 1/4 to 29 1/4.
   Motorola rose 1/2 to 61 3/8. The Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday that the company has reached an agreement
in principle with Toshiba to establish a semiconductor joint
venture in Scotland, expanding a three-year relationship
between the two concerns.
   Canadian Pacific gained 1/8 to 15 3/4 on 1.6 million
shares. The company said it plans to repurchase nearly 31.5
million of its common shares, or 9.9% of the shares
outstanding, in a one-year buy-back program starting next
week.
   Corroon &amp; Black, which jumped 6 3/4 in composite trading
Wednesday after Aon offered $40 a share for the company,
retreated 1 3/8 to 36 1/4 on 1.2 million shares. Britain's
Willis Faber, which previously agreed to a stock-swap merger
of the company, said it is still committed to that offer. Aon
fell 1 1/8 to 31 7/8.
   MGM/UA Communications, profiled in the Journal's "Heard on
the Street" column, fell 5/8 to 14 5/8. Traders and analysts
believe the stock could retreat below 10, and perhaps into a
range of 7 to 8, if Pathe  Communications doesn't complete
its takeover of the company.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.18
to 322.01. Volume totaled 9,720,000 shares.

   The Gatineau mill has annual capacity of 565,000 metric
tons of newsprint and primarily serves North American
customers. The Dalhousie mill has annual capacity of 340,000
metric tons and mostly serves European and Asian customers. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

<TEXT>
   The strike was called by the Canadian Paperworkers Union.
Members of the same union struck Monday at seven
Abitibi-Price Inc. mills in eastern Canada. Six of those
mills produce newsprint.
   Together, the strikes against the two companies have
closed more than 12% of North American newsprint capacity.

   LOS ANGELES -- A federal bankruptcy court judge here,
granted Management Co. Entertainment Group Inc. a one-day
extension to answer a creditor petition for involuntary
liquidation of its movie unit.
   The extension was granted after the company switched law
firms and amid reports that there is pressure on Jonathan D.
Krane, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, to
resign. Mr. Krane was the subject of a front-page profile
yesterday in this newspaper. Mr. Krane couldn't be reached
for comment.

   In a court filing objecting to a longer extension, an
attorney for the creditors said MCEG representatives had told
him that "a dispute is raging and is unresolved concerning
the management of the {company} and that present management
is resisting unconditional ouster without some kinds of
unspecified protection."
   MCEG said it expects to make an announcement about plans
for a reorganization today. The company has been negotiating
a possible restructuring with a number of potential investors
including Domino Management Co., a group headed by Norman
Levy, a consultant. Mr. Levy didn't return phone calls.
   Leslie A. Cohen, an attorney for MCEG, said the company's
movie unit is considering filing for protection from
creditors under federal bankruptcy law.
   MCEG, a movie production, talent management and
distribution company, is in default on more than $100 million
of debt and its largest creditors include the GE Capital unit
of General Electric Co. The petition for involuntary
liquidation of the movie unit was filed by director Nicolas
Roeg and two other creditors.

   New York Officials
   Urged to Broaden
   Nynex Unit Probe

   The New York State Assembly's investigative unit rebuked
state regulators for inadequately examining alleged
wrongdoing in transactions between New York Telephone and
other Nynex Corp. units.
   A report released yesterday by Richard Brodsky, chairman
of the Assembly's Oversight, Analysis and Investigation
Committee, recommended that state regulators broaden their
investigation into New York Telephone. The report urged the
state Public Service Commission to examine individual
transactions between the phone company and other Nynex units
as well as all management, construction and engineering
contracts with affiliated companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It further suggested that the Public Service Commission
begin civil penalty proceedings for alleged wrongdoing in New
York Telephone transactions with affiliates. That includes,
Mr. Brodsky said, any transactions arranged between
participants at annual gatherings in Florida, nicknamed
"pervert conventions," that were organized by an executive of
Nynex's purchasing arm. The parties included several
employees of Nynex, more than 30 suppliers, and prostitutes.
   New York Telephone is in the middle of a major rate case
in New York state. The company has asked for a rate increase
of about $825 million beginning in January, a figure that
some analysts say could rise beyond $1 billion after certain
adjustments are made in subsequent months.
   Assemblyman Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester, said the
committee inquiry into the Public Service Commission's
performance started eight months ago. That was after the
committee opposed a settlement agreement -- negotiated by the
phone company and the PSC staff -- that would have ended any
investigation into questionable transactions among Nynex
affiliates.
   A spokesman for New York Telephone said the report "fails
to recognize the thousands of pages of testimony and hundreds
of hours of direct questioning and cross examination" of
outside experts who found no overpayments that boosted phone
rates. Besides, he said, the phone company cut from the rate
case any "questionable amounts arising from allegations of
overpayments," and in March eliminated its purchasing unit's
independent status, making it part of New York Telephone and
New England Telephone.
   Peter Bradford, chairman of the PSC, said that although he
hadn't seen the committee report, New York Telephone
customers "are not paying and will not pay for alleged
improprieties." For the past five years, New York Telephone
has been operating under a rate moratorium. "Since our
investigation is far from over," he said, "it is hard for me
to imagine any valid critique of it at this point."
   But the report drew the endorsement ot the New York
attorney general's office, which has been highly critical of
the way the rate case has been handled. "We welcome the
findings and hope the PSC will pay attention," said Charlie
Donaldson, an assistant attorney general.

   Applied Biosystems Inc. said it would incur a $5 million
pretax charge in the first quarter ending Sept. 28 to cover
the cost of relocating its liquid chromatography components
operation from New Jersey to California.
   A spokesman said the charge is equal to about $4 million,
or 25 cents a share, after taxes. In the year-earlier
quarter, Applied reported net income of $2.3 million, or 16
cents a share, on sales of $36.8 million.

   The equipment maker for the biotechnology industry, based
in Foster City, Calif., said the relocation would "enhance
its ability to support its customer base, more effectively
coordinate new product development efforts and improve its
overall cost structure."
   Liquid chromatography is a process to separate molecules.
Applied said about 20% of the 113 workers employed in the
operation would be relocated; the company employs 1,300
people world-wide.

   Iran May Buy Grain From Argentina
   And Send Some to Iraq Despite Embargo

   WASHINGTON -- Iran apparently is planning large grain
purchases from Argentina, raising U.S. concerns that Tehran
may send some grain to Iraq despite an international trade
embargo.
   Argentine officials are negotiating the sale with Iran,
diplomats here said. U.S. officials worry that Iran, which
has said it is considering sending food and medicine to Iraq,
may transfer some of the grain to Baghdad on humanitarian
grounds. Iran and Argentina have said they will respect a
United Nations ban on trade with Iraq.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many officials doubt Iran will become a conduit for large
amounts of commerce in or out of Iraq and believe the
Argentine purchase could be strictly for Iran's growing
internal needs.
   At a meeting in Moscow, Secretary of State James Baker and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze considered
proposing new U.N. actions to tighten the embargo, including
sanctions against nations that ship goods to Iraq by air.
Washington has accused Libya of sending cargo flights,
possibly containing military supplies and spare parts, to
Baghdad. There also have been reports North Korea may be
sending in goods by air.
   Officials of the U.S. and other nations struggled at the
U.N. to draft rules defining when and how food and medicine
could be sent to Iraq for humanitarian reasons. U.S.
officials consider the effort essential to prevent nations
from using a clause in the U.N. sanctions resolution allowing
humanitarian shipments to begin large-scale shipments.
   One U.S. official said the administration is facing "tough
sledding" in persuading other nations to accept the terms
Washington prefers.
   Meanwhile, Iraq issued what some considered a warning of
terrorism against U.S. targets. Iraq's official news agency
said the Iraqi Foreign Ministry delivered a note to the top
U.S. diplomat in Baghdad warning that "the American
government and President Bush should expect that the crimes
the United States of America is committing against the Arab
nation and the insult it is directing to the Islamic shrines
by occupying holy lands will undoubtedly produce a natural
reaction from the Arab and Islamic masses."
   The note apparently was a response to a message a day
earlier by the U.S. warning that Iraq would be held
responsible for any terrorist attack by those acting on its
behalf. A State Department official said the U.S. warning was
prompted by past Iraqi ties to terrorism rather than any
specific threat.
   Separately, the Japanese embassy in Washington announced
that Tokyo would provide an additional $1 billion in
logistical support for the U.S.-led force in the Persian
Gulf. The Japanese also pledged $2 billion in economic aid to
such frontline nations as Egypt, Turkey and Jordan. With the
new pledges, Japan's contribution to the Gulf effort would
total $4 billion.
   The Associated Press reported that West Germany and other
European nations also were considering additional
contributions.
   The State Department said it is arranging two more
chartered airline flights to evacuate U.S. citizens from
Kuwait and Iraq, one leaving today and the other tomorrow.
The department said that 920 American women, dependents and
others already have left Iraq and Kuwait, while about 1,350
Americans remain in Kuwait and 200 in Iraq.
   It wasn't clear how big Iran's prospective purchase of
Argentine grain might be, but there was speculation in grain
markets that it would be substantial and that some of it
could go to Iraq. The speculation arose in part because Iran
and Iraq agreed this week to resume full diplomatic ties.
During negotiations in Iran, Iraqi officials reportedly
suggested a swap of refined petroleum products, which Iran
needs because its refineries were damaged in the Iran-Iraq
war, for food, which Iraq needs because of the embargo.
   Argentina denied knowledge of any attempt to break the
blockade. "We have every intention to observe the blockade,"
said Guido di Tella, Argentina's ambassador to Washington.
"Any Argentine sales to Iran are between two countries that
have agreed to observe the blockade."
   Iran's needs for grain are considerable. It apparently is
importing more wheat than ever before, about five million
metric tons a year, according to an Agriculture Department
official. The nation had a bad wheat harvest in 1989, but
private analysts think this year's harvest is better.
   Last year, Iran bought 1.5 million metric tons of grain
each from the European Community and Australia, the
Agriculture Department official said. According to recent
reports, Argentina exported 1.4 million metric tons of hard
wheat to Iran in the first seven months of this year,
compared with 390,000 metric tons in the first six months of
1989.
   Some analysts believe Iran may want to allow some seepage
of goods to Iraq, both as a show of its own strategic
importance in the Persian Gulf conflict and to earn more
concessions from Iraq on such issues as border demarcation
and prisoner exchanges in the two nations' peace talks.
   But beyond that, Iran may have little incentive to
strengthen its neighbor. "I remain a huge skeptic about these
stories of embargo-busting by Iran," says Shaul Bakhash, an
Iranian scholar and author at George Mason University. "The
Iranians have absolutely no interest in facilitating the
acquisition of Kuwait by Iraq."
   In the Middle East, Secretary of State Baker is scheduled
to meet today with Syrian President Hafez Assad to discuss
the anti-Iraq campaign. Syria currently has 4,000 troops in
Saudi Arabia and the nearby United Arab Emirates. There were
reports that Mr. Assad is prepared to send another 10,000
troops and about 300 tanks to the region.
   Mr. Baker replied to a declaration this week by Iran's
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that anyone who
battles U.S. "encroachment" in the Persian Gulf is engaged in
a "holy war."
   Mr. Baker said the Iranian statement is "obviously of deep
concern" and added: "We are not indifferent to threats
against our forces, which are there as part of a
multinational presence that includes Moslem and Arab nations.
The Iranians know that we have been invited in to deter an
Iraqi attack."
   The Iranian stance could be a topic of discussion between
Mr. Baker and President Assad, who has been Iran's main Arab
ally and a foe of Iraq.

   NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. and the Tokyo Broadcasting System
entered into a joint agreement to share news bureaus,
exchange news footage and perhaps co-produce sports and
entertainment programming.
   Under terms of the agreement, the first between a U.S. and
a Japanese network, CBS News and TBS will share facilities,
camera crews and, occasionally, correspondents, throughout
the world. TBS operates full-time news bureaus in locations
where CBS News doesn't have a presence, including Cairo,
Vienna and Seoul, South Korea.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement comes as the three major broadcast networks
are struggling to cover world events with severe budget
constraints. The news divisions' budgets are running over
because of rising costs, including those for covering the
crisis in the Middle East. And next year promises little
relief. For instance, the annual budget of NBC News,
estimated at $250 million, is likely to have zero growth next
year, said officials within National Broadcasting Co., a
General Electric Co. unit.
   Co-ventures between U.S. broadcast networks and foreign
news-gathering agencies aren't new. NBC News has a 38%
ownership of Visnews Ltd., and ABC News, a unit of Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., owns 45% of Worldwide Television News, and
the company says it expects to increase its stake to 80% by
Monday.
   Financial terms of the agreement between CBS and TBS, set
to go into effect in April, weren't disclosed. TBS gets
exclusive rights to all CBS News programming, including the
"Evening News with Dan Rather" and "60 Minutes." Currently,
CBS News and TBS share facilities and camera crews in such
locations as Johannesburg, South Africa, and Tokyo.
   CBS officials said no details had been finalized on sports
or entertainment shows that would be co-produced with TBS.
CBS, the No. 3-rated network in prime time, has been
discussing possible co-productions with the British
Broadcasting Corp., although no joint productions between the
two companies have been announced.
   "The centerpiece of this deal is the news," said James A.
Warner, president of CBS Enterprises. "We could do a
miniseries or movie in entertainment. In sports, it could be
sharing coverage or the bidding for an event."
   TBS created the show on which ABC's top-rated "American's
Funniest Home Videos" is based.
   CBS News has "done nothing" to jeopardize its editorial
independence, said John Frazee, vice president of CBS News
services. In fact, TBS distributed copies of the CBS News
Standards and Practices handbook to its personnel. Mr. Frazee
said CBS "hasn't ruled anything out," including the
possibility of TBS correspondents occasionally appearing on
CBS News broadcasts when TBS covers an event and a CBS News
correspondent isn't available. "They have a number of people
who speak excellent English," he said.
   CBS isn't ruling out additional co-ventures with other
foreign broadcasters, Mr. Frazee said.

   Clears New Rules
   For Debt Issues

   NEW YORK -- An accounting standards body voted to issue
partial new guidelines on the way financial institutions
account for debt securities held as investments.
   In a 15-0 vote at its meeting in Seattle, the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants said it would require
institutions to disclose information in the notes to
financial statements about the amortized cost and market
value of debt securities held as investments, as well as the
gross unrealized gains and losses for various categories of
debt securities it identified.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The committee's action represents a scaling back of a more
stringent proposal the banking and accounting industries had
opposed that would have required recognizing changes in the
value of certain of the debt securities held as investments
on the income statement. Currently, debt securities held as
investments are marked at historical cost, while those held
as trading assets are marked to market.
   The accounting panel earlier this week softened its stand
on the proposal after receiving overwhelmingly negative
feedback from banks and accountants. Those groups criticized
the original proposal because they say it would have created
wide swings in earnings of financial institutions, rather
than give investors a clearer picture of the value of debt
securities held, as was intended.
   The panel has yet to decide the issue of when to recognize
a loss when an investment security declines in value. John L.
Kreischer, committee chairman, said the panel would meet with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the chief
rule-making body, and staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to try to reach a consensus on that issue.
   The new guidelines will apply to all financial statements
for periods ending after Dec. 15. Mr. Kreischer said the
panel would probably issue the statement within 60 days.
   The categories of debt securities addressed by the new
guidelines include those issued by the U.S. Treasury and
other U.S. corporations and agencies, government and
government-agency securities, municipal debt and
mortgage-backed securities.
   Institutions also will be required to disclose the amount
of debt securities due in one year or less, after one year
through five years, five to 10 years and after 10 years. In
each of those categories, the amortized cost and market value
must be disclosed. Proceeds from the sale of debt securities
held as investments and gross realized gains and losses on
such sales also must be disclosed.
   The changes were made as part of an effort to standardize
accounting for debt securities by financial institutions.
They also were prompted by concern about abuses of current
guidelines. Critics say that under existing practice,
financial institutions can enhance their financial profile by
selling securities in which they have a profit while
continuing to carry at cost a different batch of the same
securities in which they have a paper loss.

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged a leasing firm official, a pension consultant and
three others with operating an investment scheme that cost
investors, including at least 15 pension funds, more than $26
million.
   The SEC charged that from 1983 through 1987, Governmental
Financial Services, operating under the direction of Charles
Oglebay III of Upper Marlboro, Md., sold $57 million in
unregistered securities to about 800 investors. Investors
were told that their funds would be used to purchase
equipment leases and that they would receive periodic returns
based on income from the leases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But by 1984, many of the lessees became delinquent in
their rental payments or defaulted, leading Governmental
Financial and Mr. Oglebay to operate what amounted to a Ponzi
scheme, the SEC said. Mr. Oglebay began using funds from new
investors to pay previous investors, oversold nearly $10
million in leases, and induced investors to waive their
monthly payments by telling them they would be reinvested,
the agency charged.
   The SEC also alleged that Mr. Oglebay and Ralph
McKittrick, president of New York-based McKittrick &amp; Briggs
Securities, misappropriated nearly $2.9 million of investor
funds.
   The agency also charged Glenn Dawson, who was president of
Chesapeake Bay Pension Consultants and owned 25% of
Governmental Financial, with recommending that his clients
invest in the leasing firm "without disclosing any
information about the securities." The agency said at least
15 pension clients invested in various programs connected
with Governmental Financial and that Mr. Dawson didn't
disclose that he received more than $150,000 in commissions
from the company. The SEC didn't identify the pension funds.
   By 1987, Governmental Financial had paid investors about
$31.6 million, even though its equipment leases had produced
revenue of only about $13.3 million, the SEC said. The
remainder of the funds came from other investors, the agency
added. Governmental Financial filed for protection under the
federal Bankruptcy Code in December 1987.
   Messrs. Oglebay, McKittrick and Dawson couldn't be reached
for comment.
   The SEC requested a federal court order directing the
defendants to return all of the money, plus interest,
obtained through the allegedly fraudulent scheme. The SEC
also is seeking permanent injunctions against Messrs.
Oglebay, McKittrick, and others named in the suit.

   Rise in Strategic
   Oil Reserve

   WASHINGTON -- Congress approved legislation increasing the
planned size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to one
billion barrels from 750 million and setting up a pilot
refined-product reserve.
   The measure was approved 391-0 in the House and by voice
vote in the Senate. The Bush administration had threatened a
veto over the billion-barrel size, but aides said yesterday
that the president is expected to sign the measure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, Energy Secretary James Watkins told the Senate
Energy Committee that, despite concerns about refinery
capacity, the administration expects the nation to be able to
get through the rest of the year without experiencing
significant shortages of oil or refined products. But he
added that the next meeting of the International Energy
Agency on Sept. 26 will be "very key" in determining whether
a multilateral drawdown of emergency oil stockpiles is
needed.
   In addition, Mr. Watkins unveiled a set of measures
designed to boost domestic energy production and spur
conservation. With this package, the department's efforts to
date are aimed at offsetting the loss of more than 1.1
million barrels of oil daily by the end of 1991.
   Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency released
an analysis showing that clean-air legislation pending before
a House-Senate conference committee would save 800,000 to one
million barrels of oil a day by the year 2005, when the
provisions are fully in place. Of this amount, 300,000 to
500,000 barrels would come from utilities' switching to
natural gas from oil to meet requirements under sections of
the bill aimed at curbing acid rain. The rest would result
from provisions requiring cleaner-burning fuels and the use
of nongasoline-powered fleet vehicles and cars in some
cities.
   The legislation authorizing the continued buildup of the
reserve doesn't set a deadline for filling it, which
currently contains about 590 million barrels of oil that the
goverment began stockpiling in salt domes in Louisiana and
Texas in response to the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo. The 750
million mark was to have been reached by the mid-1990s.
   The legislation also gives the administration additional
flexibility to conduct a test of the SPR, something some
lawmakers and oil-industry officials have been clamoring for
to ensure that in the event of an emergency, any drawdown of
oil would go smoothly. It also provides for a program in
which the Energy Department would set up one or more reserves
that would be separate from the SPR and contain a refined
product, such as gasoline.
   In increasing the reserve, the legislation also allows the
U.S. to begin leasing some of the crude oil as a way to
reduce the costs of filling it. In addition, it gives the
president the authority to order a limited drawdown of the
SPR to deal with a domestic disruption.
   In his Energy Committee testimony, Secretary Watkins said,
"I do believe we can manage" during the fourth quarter
without serious shortages. He referred to the time between
now and the end of the year as a "transitional period" when
efforts to increase production and conservation are taking
hold at the same time demand is increasing as winter
approaches.
   Still, he said the administration is "very concerned about
the ability of refiners to continue operating at near-maximum
capacity for an extended period of time." Moreover, he said
there is a problem with the quality of oil coming on line to
replace the lost Iraq and Kuwait crude and with the
distribution of supplies. Currently, he said, gasoline
inventories are tight but adequate.
   In his testimony, Mr. Watkins said that "right now we
don't see any across-the-board gross unfairness" by oil
companies in responding to the Mideast crisis, though he
added that "a few percent" are always going to try to take
advantage of the situation. So far, he said, there has been
just a "normal market response."
   Mr. Watkins said the various measures the department has
designed to increase domestic energy production and encourage
industry to switch to natural gas or other fuels would offset
607,500 barrels of oil a day. Among major provisions, the
department will work to resolve a problem over permits that
is holding up production in the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska.
In addition, the department urged Congress to open the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge for exploration.
   Moreover, Mr. Watkins said the agency would work to
expedite various natural-gas pipeline projects. He said the
department wants to remove regulatory barriers that prevent
the delivery of natural gas to California, where it could be
used to recover hard-to-get oil.
   The department also wants to speed the permit process of
waste-to-energy plants and accelerate the conversion of the
federal automobile fleet to non-gasoline fuels. As a first
step, Mr. Watkins announced the award of a $910,740 contract
to Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. to provide 65
vehicles that can run on either gasoline or an alternative
fuel.
   The conservation measures are aimed at saving 530,000
barrels of oil a day. Mr. Watkins said the nation could save
30,000 to 80,000 barrels of oil each day by reducing the
average octane level to 87 from 88.5. Octane measures an
engine's anti-knock capabilities.

   Audit Report by FDIC Shows Wall's Estimates
   For Thrift Bailouts in 1988 Were Wildly Low

   When federal regulators announced the sale of five
insolvent Texas thrifts to New York financier Ronald Perelman
in December 1988, they put the total cost to the government
at about $5 billion. That projection was wildly wrong. The
latest estimate: nearly $10 billion.
   This startling figure comes from a previously unreported
government study that assesses, for the first time, the costs
over the next decade of a flurry of 1988 transactions in
which regulators merged and sold 223 insolvent thrifts. At
the time, M. Danny Wall, then chairman of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, proclaimed that these deals "took care" of
the worst thrift problems. He put the cost at $39 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wrong again. The new study, a compilation of audits
prepared by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., indicates
that the total cost of the so-called Class of '88 will be $90
billion to $95 billion, including tax benefits granted the
buyers and a huge amount of interest on government debt to
help finance this assistance.
   The audits also produced other eye-openers. American
Savings Bank, sold to a group led by Dallas financier Robert
Bass, will cost the government $4.8 billion, compared with an
initial forecast of $1.7 billion. Guaranty Federal, a Dallas
thrift sold to a partnership led by Temple-Inland Inc., a
lumber company, will cost $3.4 billion, up from the $1.5
billion original forecast.
   FDIC documents and a review of the 1988 cases suggest that
Mr. Wall's public accounting of the deals was based on a
series of miscalculations and on financial legerdemain.
First, he was just guessing about the losses at these thrifts
because he had no audits of their financial condition, and he
guessed on the low side. He also excluded $9 billion of tax
benefits given the new buyers; terms of the deals enable the
government to recoup some of those benefits, but most of them
will probably remain with the buyers, increasing the cost to
taxpayers.
   And he used a method of so-called present-value analysis,
which calculated the total costs of the 1988 deals as if they
would be paid at once, even though most of the expense was
financed with 10-year notes. That method, in effect,
eliminated interest due on the notes, a sum totaling about
$14 billion. Also missing is as much as $20 billion in
interest the Treasury will have to pay on borrowings for the
transactions.
   In a small number of transactions, perhaps fewer than 10,
the regulators appear to have thrown together rescues in such
haste that far too much assistance was paid to financiers
such as Mr. Perelman. Members of Congress, and especially
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, have denounced
these sales as giveaways. Today, the House Banking Committee
will hold hearings on the 1988 deals.
   But the 1988 thrift rescues' most expensive flaw doesn't
appear to be the enrichment of tycoons. Rather, it's that
none of the deals ended or even limited the government's
exposure to mismanagement by the new owners, hidden losses on
real estate in the past or the vicissitudes of the
real-estate markets in the future. The future losses keep
growing with each new downturn in real-estate markets and
could deepen much faster in a severe recession. And some of
the deals appear to be sham transactions, in which failing
thrifts were sold to failing thrifts, which are failing all
over again.
   "The deals, and the government policy undperpinning them,
were a disaster for taxpayers, and the Bank Board's {cost
estimates} were a joke," says Gerard Smith, a Salomon Inc.
official who advised the Bank Board on one of the
transactions.
   "I didn't make the calculations," responds Mr. Wall, the
Bank Board's former chairman. "Economists and finance people
did." Moreover, Mr. Wall's defenders say, the FDIC numbers
don't include the value of equity positions that the
government has in some 1988 deals, which could be worth
several billion dollars. Mr. Wall adds that the use of
present-value figures was justified because that is a
standard government budgetary technique.
   Although the thrifts proved to be in far worse shape than
the Bank Board estimated, Mr. Wall defends his strategy for
rescuing them with open-ended assistance. "We didn't have the
money to liquidate," he says, adding that the Bank Board
eventually did include the cost of tax benefits in its
estimates.
   The FDIC audits of the 1988 transactions estimate their
cost, over the next decade, at $66 billion, excluding the tax
benefits to acquirers and interest on Treasury borrowings to
pay for assistance. The Perelman transaction, more completely
than any other, shows how these figures ballooned from Mr.
Wall's $39 billion estimate.
   In the fading days of December 1988, Mr. Perelman's
company acquired the remains of five dead Texas thrifts in
return for an investment of $315 million -- of which $160
million was in cash -- and rechristened the group First
Gibraltar Savings Bank.
   The government issued a 10-year, $862 million note to the
Perelman company to cover what Mr. Wall's team calculated to
be First Gibraltar's negative net worth -- the excess of its
liabilities over its assets. In addition, the government
agreed to make good any losses from liquidating First
Gibraltar's bad assets. That freed Mr. Perelman, who owns 97%
of the parent company's stock, of most of the risks. The
government also agreed to pay the company a generous profit
margin, starting at 2.25%, over its costs of holding these
assets. As in most of the 1988 deals, the assistance package
was to run 10 years.
   However, the calculation of First Gibraltar's losses, as
reflected by its negative net worth, turned out to be a lousy
guess. An audit conducted months later revealed that losses
at the time the deal was closed were more than $1 billion
larger than estimated. The size of the note swelled because
it was supposed to cover the negative net worth, and as that
increased, the note was increased. Mr. Wall also didn't
include the cost to the government of $1.2 billion in tax
benefits -- tax-loss carry-forward deductions and tax-free
financial aid -- given the Perelman group.
   Moreover, the government's actual cash expenses over 10
years weren't fully reflected in Mr. Wall's estimates.
Instead, he discounted the costs by roughly 10% a year over
the projected 10-year period to obtain their "present value."
Such discounting is used by government agencies to exclude
the costs of financing, partly because it would be impossible
to determine which of thousands of programs are financed by
taxes or by Treasury borrowings. But the 1988 deals were
financed by notes, and their interest costs and other
payments to the Perelmen group would have to be paid by
issuing more Treasury debt. The present-value technique
eliminated the interest charges on both the notes and
Treasury debt, understating cash outlays in the transaction
by more than $2 billion, according to one thrift economist.
   The Bank Board should have issued estimates both for cash
outlays and in present-value terms, says Dennis Pittman, an
assistant director of the FDIC's office that operates the
defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
supervised the 1988 deals. He adds that the FDIC scoured the
FSLIC's records, but couldn't find any cash estimates when it
began investigation of the transactions. It eventually came
up with a figure of roughly $60 billion, later revised
upward.
   Mr. Wall says cash estimates were in fact prepared for
each case and given to Congress, adding he "can't imagine"
why Mr. Pittman and his FDIC researchers couldn't find them.
The cash estimates were never totalled up nor publicized
because his Bank Board economists assured him "present value
was the best and most logical and most often-used identifier"
of the costs. "I'm not a financial guy or an accountant," he
says. "I relied on the expertise and advice of my
colleagues."
   Comparing the Perelman company's resulting profits to
those of well-run banks and thrifts raises the suspicion that
the Bank Board gave him too much. The new FDIC figures show
that the Perelman company received $445 million of government
money through the end of 1989, and at current interest-rate
levels will receive $8.9 billion over the next nine years, in
addition to the $1.2 billion of tax benefits.
   With that kind of assistance, First Gibraltar had 1989 net
income of $130 million and a return on assets of 1.3%, higher
than all but one of the best-run big U.S. commercial banks.
Mr. Perelman stands to make a killing on the First Gibraltar
deal: Confidential documents circulated by First Gibraltar
show that its parent company expects to distribute $250
million of dividends between 1990 and 1993 -- more than
recouping its cash investment.
   Mr. Perelman declines to comment, but Gerald Ford, the
Texas banker who runs First Gibraltar, denies that the
transaction was overly generous. He attacks the "veracity" of
the new FDIC cost estimates, saying they rely on
difficult-to-forecast interest rates and other imponderables.
   "Sure, we're making outstanding returns, but I truly
believe we will save the taxpayer money in the end," he says.

   The second section index rose 6.45 points, or 0.18%, to

shares, up from 6.9 million shares.
   Traders said they had been anticipating Nomura Securities
and the other Big Four brokerage houses to aggressively try
to place at least 150 billion yen ($1.09 billion) in new
investment trust funds on the market Thursday.
   But the brokerage houses reversed course after initial
early morning buying, as institutional and investment trust
fund selling pressure came in to counter their efforts.
   "It's obvious that no one's going to follow even if we
were to ram this market up," one trader at a Big Four firm
said early in the morning. Institutions and trust funds
"don't want to keep buying at these high levels."
   Instead, especially in the afternoon, large brokerage
houses were seen directing funds toward liquidating arbitrage
positions, according to Eichi Hayashi, a futures dealer at
Schroder Securities (Japan) Ltd.
   Nomura was also seen selling some blue-chip options,
further damping sentiment, observers said. "Nomura and the
other Big Four were expected to give support. But when they
didn't, the market got very disappointed," Mr. Hayashi said.
   Nomura also placed a large buy program on the Nikkei,
traders said, which helped return some buoyancy to the index.
   But most of the afternoon activity was directed toward
preparation for Friday's special quotation, said a futures
and options trader at Jardine Fleming (Securities).
   Brokerage buying has targeted Marubeni Corp. since early
Wednesday. The stock rose 18 yen to 673 yen Thursday.
   Tokyu Group companies also attracted interest, with Tokyu
Department Store rising 130 yen to 1660 yen, and Tokyu Corp.
up 90 yen to 1490 yen.
   Minebea, which rose 40 yen to 1110 yen, continued to be a
popular play.
   Also firmer were financial shares such as Mitsubishi Bank,
up 10 yen to 1900 yen, and Bank of Yokohama, up 90 yen to
1160 yen.
   Speculative issue Sanrio gained 270 yen to 6630 yen.
   Separately, after the close of trading, each of the Big
Four brokerages, Nomura, Yamaichi, Daiwa and Nikko, announced
sharp, downward revisions in half-year earnings predictions.
   The firms cited severely lower commission income because
of the market's recent low volume and other negative economic
effects from the Gulf crisis.
   In London, dealers said the market was wracked by crude
oil's climb above $31 a barrel, the persistent wrangling to
slice the U.S. budget deficit, and uncertainties regarding
sterling's entry into the exchange-rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System.
   "The market is highly vulnerable," said one market maker,
adding that until Wednesday, investors had begun to believe
that the situation in the Middle East had simmered down. But
with Iran's calls for a holy war a day ago, the crisis was
thrown back into the spotlight once again, stopping any fresh
interest.
   And until these major tangles are resolved, commentators
suggested that investors would have little reason to modify
existing portfolios.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index dropped
15.2 points to 2127.1. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
fell 10.4 points to 1632.9. Volume was 335.4 million shares,
down from 434.7 million issues Wednesday.
   Traders said they had hoped for some guidance from Wall
Street's opening, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average
drifted lower in early trading.
   Volume remained painfully low, dealers complained, as a
slew of earnings reports failed to inspire much trading.
Moreover, July average earnings and August unemployment data
were largely ignored by the directionless market.
   In trading, Coats Viyella, a textile concern, said
first-half pretax profit slipped 0.5% to #54.9 million
($102.1 million), ahead of expectations. The stock gained 8
pence to 99 pence.
   After sliding 40 pence a day earlier on disappointing
earnings, industrial conglomerate BTR rebounded 7 pence to
325 pence in what traders termed a technical correction from
deeply oversold positions. Nearly five million issues were
traded.
   But market makers said the broader market continued to
suffer from BTR's results, on thoughts that if a well-managed
company like BTR could muster only a 6.6% profit gain, other
companies must be set for large-scale earnings
disappointments.
   RTZ said net profit attributable to shareholders fell 3.6%
to #269 million, at the bottom half of market forecasts. RTZ
finished off 9 pence at 439 pence.
   Willis Faber, an insurance broker, said it remains
committed to its $33.51 a share offer for U.S. counterpart
Corroon &amp; Black, despite the emergence of a rival offer from
Aon Corp. for $40 a share. Willis Faber fell 21 pence to 210
pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Milan, lower in Paris,

   JUDGE SOUTER ACKNOWLEDGED an implicit constitutional right
to privacy.
   However, the Supreme Court nominee, on the first day of
his Senate confirmation hearings, declined requests to spell
out what that right encompasses. Responding to questions that
have been raised by Democratic senators and some liberal
groups, Souter attempted to depict himself as a humane,
compassionate judge. The hearing proceeded without rancor,
even though Souter generally refused to give his views on
Supreme Court decisions, including Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
ruling that recognized the right to abortion.

   WASHINGTON -- Budget talks continued for the seventh
consecutive day at Andrews Air Force Base near here with few
hints of a breakthrough on crucial remaining issues, such as
President Bush's proposal to cut capital-gains taxes.
   White House officials indicated they expect the talks to
continue into the weekend. Congressional and administration
negotiators, who met until about 1 a.m. Thursday, divided
into two groups when the talks resumed yesterday to discuss
taxes and ways to enforce a five-year deficit-reduction pact.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We still have got a big gap," Rep. Silvio Conte (R.,
Mass.), one of the negotiators, said yesterday afternoon.
Still, most of those close to the talks remained confident an
accord eventually will be reached, if only because the
economic and political stakes are so high.
   The outlines of a possible compromise on taxes are
becoming apparent as similar proposals to tax luxury goods,
increase taxes on alcoholic beverages and raise energy taxes
appear in offers made by both Democrats and Republicans in
the closed-door talks. Analyses of each side's plans showed
that the Republicans' proposal would go easier on rich people
than would the Democrats' proposal.
   People close to the talks indicated yesterday that an
increase in the cigarette tax -- currently 16 cents a pack --
is also likely to be supported by both sides.
   On spending, both sides have proposed making Medicare
beneficiaries pay more for their health insurance, but
negotiators have scaled back a plan to increase premiums for
upper-income Americans in the face of strong criticism,
people close to the talks said.
   On cutting capital-gains taxes, about the only agreement
is that the tax cut would cost the Treasury billions. GOP
negotiators Wednesday acquiesced to figures of the bipartisan
Joint Committee on Taxation showing that the Republican
capital-gains proposal would mean $24.5 billion less in
revenue over five years, according to Rep. Bill Archer (R.,
Texas). Previously, the Republicans said the tax cut would
essentially break even over five years.
   To offset that loss, the administration proposed
increasing levies on luxury goods, ozone-depleting chemicals
and some petroleum-based products, and indexing certain
excise taxes for inflation -- all ideas that have at least
some acceptance among the Democrats.
   The administration proposal would cut the capital-gains
tax, now as high as 33%, to a maximum rate of 15%. The cut
would only apply to individuals. The administration's
previous proposal called for a top rate of 19.6% for assets
sold after three years. Republicans continue to resist the
Democrats' demand that any cut in capital-gains taxes be
accompanied by an increase in income-tax rates for
upper-income Americans.
   Analyses of the competing tax packages by the Joint Tax
Committee show that the Republican plan would reduce the
burden on taxpayers with incomes above $50,000 and increase
it on those with incomes below that. The dividing line in the
Democratic tax package is $20,000.
   The contrasts are particularly sharp for upper-income
Americans because Republicans are pressing the cut in
capital-gains taxes while Democrats would impose a new
surcharge on the richest Americans. For taxpayers earning
more than $200,000 a year, the Joint Tax Committee analysis
shows, the GOP plan would cut taxes by 5.5% while the
Democratic plan would increase them by 6.7%.
   Both sides are now supporting a new 10% tax on luxury
goods, although they define luxuries slightly differently.
Both parties would tax electronic goods above $1,000, jewelry
above $5,000 and furs above $500. For autos, the Democrats'
tax would kick in above $25,000, the Republicans' above
$30,000. Republicans have a $30,000 threshold for yachts
while the Democrats proposed $50,000. Democrats would also
tax the entire cost of private planes, while Republicans
would exempt them. Aircraft makers Cessna and Beech are based
in Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole's home state of
Kansas.
   The Democrats' version would raise $1.3 billion the first
year and $10.2 billion over five years while the Republican
plan would raise about $900 million in 1991 and $7.8 billion
through 1995.
   On "sin" taxes, Democrats want to double the levies on
beer and wine, and index the taxes for inflation as of 1992.
That would raise $1.5 billion in 1991 and $8.3 billion
through 1995. An increase of $2 a proof gallon in the tax on
liquor, currently $12.50 a proof gallon, would raise another
$400 million the first year and $2 billion over five years. A
proof gallon is the equivalent of 100-proof liquor, or 50%
alcohol.
   Republicans would more than double beer and wine taxes,
which haven't been increased since 1951. But they wouldn't
change the taxes on hard liquor, last raised in 1984.
   Despite initial speculation that the Mideast crisis would
doom any new energy taxes, a broad-based tax remains a
possibility, both to raise revenue and to encourage
conservation.
   Democrats propose to tax all sources of energy roughly
based on their costs at a rate of 4%, raising an estimated
$7.8 billion the first year and $58.4 billion over five
years. While Republicans are said to be considering some form
of energy tax, their formal proposal has been limited to a
one-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline and other refined petroleum
products, excluding feedstocks.
   The Democrats want a seven-cent increase in the
nine-cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax, which would raise
$5.4 billion the first year and $33.2 billion over five
years. The Democrats' broad-based energy tax would add about
four cents a gallon more to the cost of gasoline at the pump.
   Both sides would increase the airline ticket tax, and they
appear to be moving toward raising taxes on life insurance
companies by about $1 billion in the first year, and about $7
billion over five years.
   Two ideas common to both parties' plans would each raise
about $100 million a year. One would extend the
0.1-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax that flows into a trust fund
to clean up leaking underground storage tanks at filling
stations. Another would raise levies on ozone-depleting
chemicals.

   NEW YORK -- The accounting profession, reversing its
previous position, said it supports proposed legislation that
would require auditors to notify regulators of possible
illegal acts by companies.
   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
accounting's major professional body, reached the new
position after sponsors in Congress proposed language that
would put a greater responsibility on companies to report
alleged illegal acts of corporate officers that have been
identified by auditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Congress in recent months has explored whether accountants
have failed to disclose evidence of possible illegal acts by
management that is uncovered during audits, particularly in
light of the savings and loan debacle.
   In the past, auditors have argued that making them police
corporate behavior would harm their relationships with
clients and saddle them with an unfair burden of
responsibility for the acts of others.
   Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who has sought to require
accountants to report wrong behaviors for several years,
asserts that the stiffer rules would "give us a chance to
pick up more problems at the earliest possible stage."
   Under existing requirements, when an auditor uncovers
possible illegal acts on the part of a client, he is expected
to inform the corporate audit committee and directors, and
assess whether proper corrective steps have been taken; if
not, the auditor resigns the account, which triggers a
notification to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Under the latest proposal, a company that received a
letter from an auditor, expressing concern about failure to
take proper steps, would have to notify the SEC of the
dispute. If the company failed to do so, the auditor would
have to furnish the SEC a copy of its report. The auditor
would continue to have the option of resigning.
   The accounting institute this week notified Rep. John
Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce committee, that it supports proposed changes to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The legislation could be
attached to other pending legislation as early as next week.
   In a letter to Rep. Dingell, accounting institute
officials said the proposed changes would "improve investor
confidence in the integrity and reliability of financial
statements issued by those who access public capital
markets." The proposal also has the support of the six major
accounting firms.
   Critics have asserted the current rules don't require
prompt enough disclosure of potential problems uncovered
during independent audits. In the latest proposal, if an
auditor writes a letter questioning whether appropriate
action has been taken, the company would have one day to
report receipt of such a letter; if the company failed to do
so, the auditor would have to notify the SEC on the following
business day.
   The changes include a new requirement that companies in
their annual reports discuss whether any "material
weaknesses" have been identified and remain uncorrected in
their system of internal controls.
   Though previous proposals required auditors to address
compliance with all laws and regulations, the latest changes
require them to report on potentially illegal acts that have
a material effect on a company's financial statement, which
accountants say they already do.
   Separately, the proposal requires all publicly held banks
and thrifts to report to the SEC; current rules permit banks
and thrifts that aren't part of holding companies to report
to financial regulators rather than the SEC.

   Ford Rolls Back
   Price Increases
   On Some Models

   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. has scaled back some of
its 1991 model prices increases, slashing more than $600 from
the previously announced prices of certain Taurus models.
   The move indicates that Ford believed its original price
increases were too steep for today's highly competitive car
market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I think Ford is listening to what's going on in the
market place," said Jim Hoffer, manager of Jordan Ford in
Mishawaka, Ind. Mr. Hoffer, who was critical of Ford's
original price strategy, said he's "very happy" with the new
prices.
   A Ford spokesman said that the new price list "reflects
changes in the market and what competitors have done."
   Some of the biggest rollbacks came on the high-volume
Taurus midsized models. The Taurus, a mainstay of Ford's
product line, has come under increasing competitive pressure
in the past year. Sales of the five-year-old model are down
11.4% through the end of August, nearly twice the overall
market decline.
   Ford said the cheapest 1991 Taurus L sedan now will have a
suggested list price of $13,352, up 5.6%, or $712, from a
year ago. But that is $365 less than the original 1991 price
of $13,717 that Ford announced to dealers in August. The 1991
Taurus GL wagon had an even sharper price rollback, dropping
to $14,990 from an initial 1991 price of $15,599. A year ago,
the GL wagon started at $14,722.
   Even after the rollbacks, the Taurus faces stiff price
competition. Last week, Honda Motor Co. announced a mere $200
increase for its Accord model, which was beefed up in size
and power a year ago to compete head on with the Taurus in
the midpriced family car market. The cheapest 1991 Accord
with an automatic transmission will start at $13,295. That is
$57 less than a comparable Taurus. Before the price rollback,
the Honda cost $422 less.
   Yet another Taurus competitor, the 1991 Chevrolet Lumina,
will start at $12,870.
   Ford had earlier tried to undercut these rivals by
announcing a $750 rebate on the 1991 Taurus even before it
hit the showrooms. General Motors Corp. also has announced
discounts of $500 to $1,000 on 1991 models.
   Ford chopped prices on some other key models, too. The
base price of the cheapest 1991 Thunderbird will jump 2.3% to
$15,318. Earlier, it had been slated for a 5.4% price
increase.
   The price of the cheapest four-door, four-wheel-drive Ford
Explorer will be $18,905, down from the previously scheduled
price of $19,066. The latest price still represents a 1.6%
increase from the Explorer model's $18,605 introductory price
in March.
   The new list isn't all good news for car buyers. On a few
models, Ford actually boosted prices from the earlier 1991
list. Consider the 1991 Mustang LX convertible, which now has
a base price of $16,222, compared with $15,852 on the
earlier, August price list. The latest increase means the
Mustang convertible will jump 7.1%, or $1,081, from the
year-ago base price of $15,141.

   CHICAGO -- Grain futures prices went into an expected nose
dive as markets adjusted to the Agriculture Department's
prediction of record corn and wheat crops this year.
   But prices of corn and wheat futures stabilized in late
trading, supported by the strength of soybean prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The contract for December corn delivery settled at $2.2575
a bushel, down 8 1/2 cents, after flirting with its daily
limit of 10 cents down. The December wheat contract settled
at $2.765, down 6 1/2 cents.
   November soybeans rallied at the close, finishing down 7
1/4 cents at $6.34 a bushel after trading as much as 13 cents
down. Strong demand for soybean products and relatively low
world production are exerting upward pressure on soybean
futures prices.
   Most analysts, however, predicted continuing deterioration
of wheat and corn prices. Some think corn will drop as low as
$2.05 a bushel in the near future. "It's going to be a slow
grind, but we're probably going down," said Pat O'Connell,
senior grain analyst for Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   Prices of corn futures contracts have declined by about 75
cents a bushel since July 4, when they hovered around $3. A
wet spring forced many farmers to delay planting corn, and
fears that the delay could reduce yields drove prices higher
in June. But remarkably good weather during July and August
reversed the price movement.
   "This June and July produced the most ideal growing
conditions that I can recall during those months," said Terry
Francl, economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation.
   The resulting price declines are as troubling for the
government as they are for farmers. Corn growers enrolled in
government farm programs will be able to make up for some of
the decline in selling prices through increased government
subsidies, meaning that government's costs will rise. In a
symbolic response to the corn sell-off yesterday, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced that all Agriculture
Department vehicles will begin to burn fuel containing
ethanol, which is refined from corn.
   Analysts said the department's crop estimates, contained
in a report released Wednesday, put pressure on the Bush
administration to try to prop up wheat prices. A bill
approved Tuesday by the Senate would require farmers to idle
15% of their wheat acreage in 1991, and similar legislation
is pending the House of Representatives.
   But short of extending credit to the Soviet Union for
additional purchases, the government has few options for
stopping the decline in corn prices. "I don't think there's
much the government can do," Mr. O'Connell said. "It's just
going to have to get cheap enough that people will step in
and buy the crop."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices rose modestly in increased
afternoon trading after moving listlessly in a narrow range
in the morning. Petroleum products were mixed, with gasoline
weakening slightly and heating oil rising. Traders generally
blamed the market's lack of spirit on a shortage of
attention-grabbing headlines related to the Middle East
crisis. Even a report that Iraq was warning of possible
terrorism against U.S. targets didn't stimulate buying for
long. October crude settled on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at $31.87 a barrel, up 10 cents. Gasoline ended at
93.36 cents per gallon, down 0.48 cents. The decline was
attributed to Energy Department data that showed a 1.8
million-barrel rise in gasoline inventories last week, a
bigger rise than reported recently by the American Petroleum
Institute. Heating oil finished at 83.48 cents a gallon, up
0.89 cents, following strong European prices.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell for the second
consecutive day. The November contract declined 2.45 cents a
pound to $1.3475. That contract dropped 2.60 cents Wednesday,
making a two-day loss of 5.05 cents. Judith Ganes, analyst
for Merrill Lynch, said selling was prompted by an
Agriculture Department survey released Tuesday that showed
that, despite the damaging frost in Florida last Christmas,
land planted with orange trees rose to 564,809 acres from
537,000 acres in 1988. There also was a 15% increase in the
number of trees, according to the report. "The report
apparently wasn't widely circulated outside the industry,"
Ms. Ganes said. "But apparently enough traders heard about it
so that it triggered selling based on the perception that an
increase in orange-bearing acreage and higher tree population
could result in an increased output of orange juice."
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Prices fell on expectations of an increase in
supplies. The September contract declined 3.10 cents a pound
to $1.3280, while December, the most active contract, was off
1.80 cents to $1.2695. The September price's premium over
December's thus narrowed by 1.30 cents to stand at 5.85
cents. The cash contract's premium over the three-month
futures contract on the London Metal Exchange also narrowed.
Selling was triggered by predictions that supplies of copper
in LME warehouses will increase this week by 10,000 to 20,000
tons, analysts said; the supply report is due today. On the
Commodity Exchange in New York, the decline in the December
contract was accelerated when the price dropped below $1.27 a
pound. However, it stabilized at $1.2625 and recovered
slightly toward the close. Yesterday's setback doesn't change
the general perception that there is a tightness of
immediately available supplies of copper, one analyst said.

   The Good Stock-Bad Stock Chasm Gets Ugly

   NEW YORK -- It's a love-hate market. The stocks that Wall
Street adores are thriving. But those it despises are
languishing as rarely before.
   A study this week by David Katz, chief investment officer
of Matrix Asset Advisors in New York, gives new evidence of
what many investment pros suspected: Investors today are
making the sharpest distinctions between in-favor and
out-of-favor stocks since the famous "two-tier market" of
1972-74.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If history is a guide, the situation shouts two warnings
at investors. First, the overall stock market may tumble, as
it did with a thud in 1974. Second, investors may want to
rediscover those out-of-favor issues. The proud favorites
often take the biggest falls.
   Mr. Katz studied the multiple of stock prices to
companies' book values (assets minus liabilities). As the
accompanying chart shows, he found that the price-to-book
multiples for the favorite fifth of New York Stock Exchange
issues are 2.17 times those of the average stock (see
accompanying table -- WSJ Sep. 14, 1990). This is the biggest
lead for the favorites since 1974.
   But stocks in the least-favorite fifth are selling for
price-book multiples 65% below those of the average stock.
This is the fattest discount in the 18-year period the study
covers. (The next-fattest discount was 64%, in 1973.)
   In short, the stock market equivalent of prom queens have
even more dates than usual, and the wallflowers are lonelier
than ever.
   Take Wal-Mart Stores and Sears Roebuck, for example. No
fewer than 17 brokerage houses recommend Wal-Mart, which
sells for 25 times the company's past 12 months' per-share
earnings. Sears, by contrast, is despised. Only four
brokerage houses recommend it, and Sears stock sells for only
eight times earnings.
   "There is no question that Wal-Mart is a vastly superior
company," Mr. Katz says. But he believes it is irrational to
pay three times as much for a dollar of Wal-Mart earnings as
for a dollar of Sears earnings. Investors, in his view, are
"paying too much for the growth prospects in Wal-Mart and . .
. assuming that Sears earnings are never going to grow
again."
   At some point, he says, "Sears is going to get a little
bit smarter . . . and Wal-Mart is going to slow down."
   Others also believe the market has gone to extremes. "The
gap between {stocks} that are loved and those that are hated,
I've never seen it widen so much," Richard Welty, portfolio
manager with LaTeef Management Associates in San Francisco,
says. "Stocks have been taken to excesses, both on the upside
and on the downside."
   Mr. Welty himself is a "growth" manager, one who chooses
stocks with rapidly rising earnings that are expected to
persist. Accordingly, he is content with the way the market
has been acting.
   "We've skewed ourselves to the big, blue-chip stocks," he
says. "It sounds terrible, but we're afraid to own some of
the others, even though . . . there are some better values"
in less-known issues. "It makes it sound like we're just
investing with the herd, but boy, it's a lot safer these
days."
   While growth-stock managers thrived, "value" managers have
languished. The value crowd seeks out stocks that seem
underpriced in relation to companies' earnings, dividends or
book value. Last year and this year, those apparent bargains
have just kept sagging in price.
   But value managers believe their return to favor won't be
much longer in coming. "We will have our time in the sun in
the fairly near future," says Mr. Katz, a strict devotee of
the value school.
   Value investing "has worked over a very long period of
time. It has almost never been out of favor for this long,"
David Dreman, a well-known value manager in New York, says.
"I think we're within six months or even less of a major
move" toward a more evenhanded investor attitude on various
stocks.
   Mr. Dreman recently studied the performance of stocks with
high price-earnings ratios (typically growth stocks) and
those with low P-E ratios (value stocks) over 18 overlapping
five-year periods, beginning with 1969-1973 and ending with
1985-1989. (The study was limited to large-company stocks.)
In 16 of the 18 periods, value stocks did better.
   In only two periods did stocks with high price-earnings
ratios win. One of those periods was the past five years. The
other was the period 1969-1973.
   Accordingly, Mr. Dreman believes investors will be
rewarded if they stick with out-of-favor issues such as
banking, computer and auto stocks. Among his holdings are
Ford Motor, International Business Machines, Compaq, Barnett
Banks, Norwest and First Union.
   All this has made people say that we are in another market
like that of the early 1970s, when a select group called the
"Nifty 50" stocks captured most of the glory and a huge share
of investors' money. After being bid up to exorbitant
heights, the stocks, including McDonald's, IBM and Xerox,
collapsed in the bear market of 1974.
   John L. Manley Jr., a quantitative strategist at Smith
Barney, has listed the stocks he believes are today's
equivalent of the Nifty 50. He dubs it the Sweet 16.
   Abbott Laboratories, Boeing, Browning Ferris Industries,
Coca-Cola, General Electric, and General Mills are all
members of the Sweet 16. So are H.J. Heinz, Johnson &amp;
Johnson, Eli Lilly, Merck, PepsiCo, Philip Morris, Procter &amp;
Gamble, Toys "R" Us, Wal-Mart and Waste Management.
   "These are the favored few," Mr. Manley says, meaning the
stocks that investors have chased after, not necessarily the
ones Smith Barney recommends.
   Not all indicators show that this is a love-hate market.
P-E multiples (stock prices divided by per-share earnings)
haven't gone to the extremes that some other measures have.
   And not everyone thinks that stocks are due to become more
equal. R. Joseph Fuchs, director of research at Kidder
Peabody, is among those who believe today's big disparities
could last a long time, or even widen. He believes that the
economy will poke along in the 1990s and that inflation will
be low. Companies and industries will increasingly show
themselves to be clear winners or losers. And this time, he
says, there will be almost "no takeovers to rescue the
turkeys."
   Thomas Mench, vice president for investments at Leshner
Financial Services in Cincinnati, says the bedraggled state
of Wall Street also may be contributing to the love-hate
market. Stocks of many lesser-known companies aren't followed
by brokerage houses anymore, he says, so no one is pushing
investors to buy them.
   Nevertheless, many market veterans say the current
two-tier market isn't likely to last much longer. Robert
Moseson, president of Performance Analytics, a Chicago
concern that tracks money managers, says he has never seen
growth managers outperform value managers by such a lopsided
margin.
   Outperforming value managers, he says, "was almost as easy
as killing fish in a barrel" for growth managers. But in the
past, he says, such lopsided results haven't lasted much more
than 18 months -- and it has been that long already. The
growth-stock fans in the past, he says, have tended to shine
when "the market is on very shaky legs."

   AKRON, Ohio -- Telxon Corp. said it expects earnings for
its fiscal second-quarter to exceed 20 cents a share,
excluding a nine-cent-a-share gain from purchasing about $8
million of its bonds. The company said it expects revenue to
top $43 million in the quarter ending Sept. 30.
   For the year-earlier period, the maker of portable
computers posted a loss of $3.9 million, or 30 cents a share,
on revenue of $35.4 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the year ending March 31, Telxon said it expects
per-share earnings of 70 cents to 75 cents a share, excluding
the nine-cent-a-share gain from the bond purchase and a
16-cent-a-share gain from a bond purchase earlier this year.
Telxon estimated that revenue will be $170 million to $175
million.
   In fiscal 1990, the company had a loss of $14.4 million,
or $1.09 a share, on revenue of $143.4 million.
   Telxon said it purchased in open market transactions a
total of $8 million face amount of its 7.5% convertible
subordinated debentures due 2012. The purchase represents
about 23% of the outstanding issue, leaving about $28 million
face amount outstanding. Earlier this year, the company
purchased about $10 million of the bonds.

   DALLAS -- Nelson Bunker Hunt and his major creditors have
tentatively settled a mineral-rights dispute that had been
holding up the sale of more than $70 million of real estate
from the oilman's estate.
   Hit by heavy losses from their investments in silver and
oil, Mr. Hunt and his brother, William Herbert Hunt, filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code in 1988. Under a reorganization plan
negotiated with creditors last year, Nelson Bunker Hunt was
permitted to keep a 50% interest in the mineral rights to
certain non-producing properties. Mr. Hunt and his creditors
subsequently disagreed over which properties were included
under that clause.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under an agreement filed in federal bankruptcy court here
this week, Mr. Hunt will receive $315,000 from the sale of
two family-owned Canadian oil companies, a 50% interest in
the coal and lignite leases on one Texas ranch and a 60%
interest in oil and gas leases on one Oklahoma property.
Although mineral rights to certain other properties will be
shared, control of most will revert to the trustee
liquidating Mr. Hunt's estate. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold
Abramson is expected to rule on the settlement next month.
   "We're moving full-speed ahead," said trustee Carter Pate,
who said settlement would allow him to finalize sales on Mr.
Hunt's Circle T Ranch near Dallas and several other
properties in Texas and Kentucky.
   The Hunt brothers and their creditors have yet to settle a
dispute involving how much the Texas oilmen should be paid
for their efforts to help the liquidating trustees in both
cases sell their collections of rare coins and antiques.

   Mulling of Rise in Medicare Premiums
   Spurs Attack by Special Interest Groups

   WASHINGTON -- Reports that budget negotiators are
considering increases in Medicare premiums have touched off a
pre-emptive attack that illustrates the political perils any
deficit-reduction plan will face in Congress.
   In the face of gathering opposition within Congress and
from senior citizen's groups, there were reports from the
closed-door budget negotiations late yesterday that
negotiators had scaled back initial plans to boost Medicare
premiums by as much as $3.9 billion next year and $40.8
billion over five years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the initial proposal, once nervously supported by both
Democrats and Republicans at the budget summit, may have
poisoned the well for other efforts to make 33 million
elderly and disabled beneficiaries pay higher premiums for
their federal health benefits.
   "This kind of proposal, even it's withdrawn, probably
makes it harder for the summiteers to encourage everyone to
do their fair share" as part of an effort to achieve $500
billion in budget cuts over five years, said Martin Corry,
director of federal relations at the American Association of
Retired Persons, the nation's largest senior-citizens group.
   Horace Deets, AARP's executive director, said, "We've been
answering a steady stream of calls. People are incredulous.
They just don't understand this."
   The rapid response to the Medicare proposal, first
described in press reports Wednesday, is only one of a
widening tide of protests over the plans being worked out by
budget negotiators.
   For example, all 34 members of the New York House
delegation wrote Majority Leader Thomas Foley and Minority
Leader Robert Michel asking them to oppose a Republican
effort to limit the deductibility of state and local taxes.
   And George Gould, chief lobbyist for the National
Association of Letter Carriers, said that the union is
threatening to stop making campaign contributions to members
of Congress who vote for a deficit-reduction measure that
includes a proposal to slow the growth of federal pensions.
Part of the budget plan, which is still subject to change,
would cancel the next cost of living increase for federal
employees and hold future increases to less than the rate of
inflation.
   The American Medical Association is worried about proposed
Medicare cuts that could cost hospitals and doctors $3.4
billion in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, and a total of
$31.5 billion over five years. But one of the provisions that
irritates the AMA the most is a relatively low-cost change --
a proposal to charge doctors $1 for each Medicare form they
file by mail, rather than electronically. The $300 million
revenue generator would hurt rural doctors in particular, the
AMA argues. "We definitely will oppose those kinds of
things," an AMA official says.
   Every deficit-reduction measure that's taken out of the
package will have to be replaced with something else, unless
the Congressional and White House negotiators trim their
targets of $50 billion in cuts in fiscal 1991 and $500
billion over five years.
   Many analysts believe that substantial adjustments are
necessary to slow the rapidly growing cost of the $105
billion-a-year Medicare program. But the politics are
treacherous.
   "I don't know how they could even consider a capital-gains
tax cut when they're sticking it to seniors like this" with a
proposed premium increase, says William Ritz, public affairs
director of the National Committee to Preserve Social
Security and Medicare. The committee led the fight to repeal
the law extending Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses,
along with the surtax the law imposed on some senior
taxpayers.
