   FAA Reassigns Security Program Chief
   On Eve of Report on Lockerbie Disaster

   The Federal Aviation Administration's security chief was
reassigned on the eve of the release of a new report expected
to be highly critical of the agency's security program before
and after the Lockerbie disaster in which 270 people died.
   Raymond Salazar, director of the FAA's Office of Civil
Aviation Security, next month will take the helm at the
Center for Management Development in Palm Coast, Fla., the
agency's main management-training facility.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since the terrorist downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, Mr. Salazar has been
under intense fire from relatives of those killed as well as
from some members of Congress.
   Separately, Pan Am Corp. reached a settlement with
residents of the Scottish town of Lockerbie who lost
relatives, were injured or lost property as a result of the
attack. The bombing killed 11 people on the ground, in
addition to all 259 people on the plane.
   The new report, by the President's Commission on Aviation
Security and Terrorism, is due out next Tuesday. It is
expected to admonish the FAA for serious lapses in security
and call for major changes in the nation's aviation-security
program. It also is expected to urge the Bush administration
to take a tougher stand against state-sponsored terrorism.
   Two family groups organized after the terrorist attack,
Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 and Families of Pan Am
103-Lockerbie, have called repeatedly for Mr. Salazar's
resignation, contending that the security program he oversaw
was riddled with deficiencies.
   FAA officials have defended Mr. Salazar. Yesterday, FAA
Administrator James Busey asserted that the report and Mr.
Salazar's job-change weren't connected. "We needed a good man
for the job and we've got one," he said in a statement.
   But within the aviation community, the reassignment, first
reported in Aviation Daily, a trade publication, was widely
viewed as an effort by the FAA to blunt the commission's
report.
   The seven-member panel, headed by former Labor Secretary
Ann McLaughlin, was appointed in August 1989. It will
recommend steps to increase the accountability of government
and airline officials involved in security operations.
   The commission's April public hearing demonstrated the
controversy surrounding Mr. Salazar, as well as the confusion
and contradictions surrounding security efforts at the time
of the bombing. Officials from the FAA and Pan Am told the
panel that the airline hadn't been hand-searching
unaccompanied baggage put aboard planes in Frankfurt, where
the doomed Pan Am flight originated. The luggage was X-rayed
only.
   Pan Am said it had received permission from Mr. Salazar to
skip the required hand searches -- a contention Mr. Salazar
hotly denied before the commission.
   Panel members also expressed consternation that airline
security in Frankfurt remained inadequate for eight months
following the bombing.
   Concerning the settlement, attorneys for both sides
declined to disclose its terms. The agreement covers 270
claims for damages from ground victims. It doesn't affect
lawsuits that have been filed on behalf of the passengers who
lost their lives in the disaster.
   Attorneys for the ground victims alleged Pan Am failed to
take adequate steps to prevent a terrorist attack.
   There was no limit to the amount of damages the ground
victims could collect from Pan Am, the attorneys said.
Passenger claims, however, are covered by international
treaties that limit the airline's liability to $75,000 per
person. Attorneys must prove Pan Am guilty of gross
negligence to win higher awards. British aviation officials
are still investigating the incident. Their findings will
form the basis for settling passenger claims.
   Pan Am said the settlement with ground victims will be
covered by its insurers and won't have any immediate effect
on its finances.

   LONDON -- The Bank of England forecasts that faster
growth, higher inflation and sustained high interest rates
can be expected in the world's major economies over the next
year.
   In its quarterly bulletin, the bank warns that although
"moderation" has so far prevailed in labor market pressures
in North America, Japan and Europe, "the risk nevertheless
remains that unduly buoyant demand could, in due course,
overstretch supply and push up labor and goods prices
everywhere."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bank said that following the swift move toward German
reunification, along with signs of further acceleration in
other economies, it has increased its forecast to 3 1/2%
average growth in the major economies this year. That's half
a percentage point higher than the forecast given its
previous bulletin in February.

   Do As We Do:
   Our Survey Shows Cardiologists
   Take Their Own Advice to Heart

   FOUR OUT OF 10 cardiologists take an aspirin tablet --
either once a day or every other day -- to reduce their own
risk of heart attack.
   That was among the findings of a Wall Street Journal
survey of cardiologists, doctors who specialize in treating
people for heart disorders. The purpose of the survey was to
determine not what cardiologists advise their patients to do
but what they themselves do in their daily lives to prevent
heart disease.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Four hundred cardiologists participated in the survey, in
the form of a written questionnaire. In addition to formal
questions, the doctors were also invited to provide written
comments.
   The findings indicated that cardiologists tend to be more
aggressive than the general population in taking steps to
avoid heart disease in their own bodies. For instance, 63%
said they get a good cardiovascular workout at least three
times a week, and almost 98% said they don't smoke
cigarettes.
   "Risk-factor control is very important. I practice what I
preach," said one physician. Another, W.F. Haynes Jr., a
cardiologist who practices in Princeton, N.J., wrote:
"Aerobics are the most important factor. I compete in
swimming and I'm 63 years old."
   The doctors were probably most adamant on the subject of
smoking. "I rarely see any patient with heart problems under
the age of 65 -- unless they are smokers," said one
cardiologist. Another wrote that he blamed cigarettes for his
father's fatal heart attack, at age 47.
   Based on their own example, the doctors rate the following
as the most important preventive steps: stopping smoking;
altering diet to reduce cholesterol; limiting intake of salt;
exercising; and taking aspirin.
   Perhaps the most surprising result of the survey was the
large number of doctors who take aspirin -- especially given
the continuing medical controversy over whether aspirin
actually reduces the mortality rate. (Studies show it can
increase the risk of bleeding ulcer or stroke.) Of the 40%
who said they take aspirin, roughly half said they take a
single tablet every day, while the rest said they take one
tablet every other day.
   The least popular action: eating oat bran. Only a third of
the doctors said they make a special effort to include oat
bran in their diets.
   The cardiologists clearly felt these steps improved their
odds of survival. Asked about their own chances of dying from
a heart attack, 82% of the doctors said they thought that
their risk was equal to or below that of individuals of the
same age and sex. Only 18% thought their risks were greater
-- most of them citing either known heart disease or the
stress associated with their profession.
   All but 4% of the doctors said they've tested their own
cholesterol levels; 17% said their levels were too high.
About 60% had gone a step further and taken at least one
treadmill stress test.
   Only 6% of the survey respondents said they have heart
disease now.
   A number of the doctors, however, wrote that they often
have trouble following their own advice. "My motivation to
exercise is like a yo-yo," said C.G. Reddy, a cardiologist in
Columbus, Ohio. Another doctor wrote: "I wish the fast-food
industry would create a prudent pizza."
   Some said they believe the craze over cholesterol is
overblown. "The wrong segment of our population -- elderly
females and nonsmoking women -- are overly concerned about
their cholesterol, while men who smoke or who have
significant family history {of heart disease} are not,"
complained one physician.
   Reed J. Wilson, a doctor in Beverly Hills, Calif., said
that the population's obssession with cholesterol was
intruding in his life. "I recently attended a charity affair.
I chose meat over fish for dinner, and through the whole meal
I had to listen to each person's opinion of my diet. It was
difficult not to comment as I watched each of them put ranch
dressing on their `healthy salads,' thick hollandaise sauce
on their `healthy fish' and then finish with a heavy layer of
caramel and chocolate on their ice-cream dessert (oh, but
they only ate half)."
   Several doctors expressed the belief that the profession
is on the verge of making great strides in reducing heart
attacks. "I believe aggressive vegetarian regimens and
relaxation techniques can reverse heart disease," said J.
Gary Grant, a cardiologist in Pacific Grove, Calif. Another
doctor, James Nilson, wrote: "A more thorough analysis of
risk factors, together with improved techniques for early
detection, should decrease the incidence of {heart atttacks}
in our country markedly."

   MEXICO CITY -- Consumer prices rose 1.5% in April,
bringing the rise for the year to 10.8%, the central bank
said.
   The rate was the same as was registered in March, a Bank

restaurants, automobiles, airline tickets, hotels,
newspapers, beer and some foods were the biggest contributors
to the overall increase, the bank said. Declines in prices of
some vegetables and in electricity prices in cities that
apply summer rates helped compensate for some of the
increases, it said.

   The prices that producers pay rose 0.8% to a total of 7.2%

   Fed's Greenspan Urges Banks Not to Curb
   Lending in Reaction to Tight Supervision

   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and
other banking regulators urged banks not to curb lending in
reaction to tougher supervision.
   In a private meeting with officials of the American
Bankers Association, Mr. Greenspan, along with William
Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and
Robert Clarke, comptroller of the currency, sought to allay
fears among bankers that overzealous regulators would crack
down on prudent bank lending.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The regulators denied, however, that the unusual meeting
was prompted by concerns of some economists, bankers and
their borrowers of a credit crunch that could slow the
economy.
   "The evidence of that is quite limited," Mr. Greenspan
said after the meeting here.
   Banking regulators have stepped up their policing of
lending practices in reaction to the huge losses on
real-estate loans in the Southwest in recent years. But many
in the banking industry say that regulators have overreacted
by taking such actions as requiring some banks to increase
reserves, even for performing real-estate loans. The tougher
supervision has been felt most severely in the Northeast.
   "I think supervisory overkill and overregulation are at
the top of the list of concerns right now," said Ken Guenther
of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which
represents smaller banks. In a statement, the ABA judiciously
said: "All {bankers} agree that the rules are being applied
with increased vigor."
   Mr. Clarke has particularly been criticized by the
industry for tightening enforcement of the rules, and one
explicit purpose of the meeting was to stress that the
regulators are united in their tough approach.
   "This is not like Sherman's army marching across the
country in a wave," Mr. Clarke said after the meeting. "We
are not telling banks to quit making loans. We are telling
banks to be careful."
   The regulators did say that real estate has come under
particular scrutiny, and that includes stepped-up
examinations beyond the Northeast. "We are simply doing
targeted real-estate examinations in markets that are soft,"
Mr. Clarke said. "It's inevitable that there will be some
constriction of credit."
   Both the regulators and the bankers denied that lending
has been choked off significantly. But they both said that
some bankers are operating under the perception that all
loans will be second-guessed by regulators. Bankers have been
particularly reluctant to lend to small businesses, said the
ABA.
   But the regulators, apparently fearing a greater slowdown
in the economy, especially in an election year, took pains to
encourage prudent lending. Mr. Greenspan flew back to
Washington for the afternoon meeting, following his address
earlier in the day to a trade group in Chicago.
   One trade group official in the Washington meeting said
that Mr. Greenspan told them that, "The nature of banking is
risk-taking, and if you have zero loan losses, then you are
not doing your job."

   LIKE MANY BLACK Americans, Ellie B. Jones seems stranded
behind enemy lines in the war on heart disease.
   The 71-year-old McDonough, Ga., retiree has had high blood
pressure for years. But Mr. Jones, who lives with his wife
and son, hasn't been able to afford the blood-pressure pills
a doctor prescribed almost a decade ago. Their cost, perhaps
$100 a month, is "out of sight," he says, given that his
family's income is about $800 a month. "I take two Advils a
day and put my trust in God."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cases like Mr. Jones's represent a disturbing countertrend
to U.S. advances against heart disease. Efforts to cut
hypertension and other risk factors, coupled with better
treatments, have sharply lowered the heart-disease death rate
since the mid-1960s. But blacks aren't sharing equally in the
gains.
   Around 1979 the decline in heart-disease mortality began
to level off among blacks while continuing for whites,
according to a 1988 study by the National Center for Health
Statistics. In a grim reminder of that disparity, researchers
recently reported that black men in New York's Harlem
district were less likely to live to age 65 than men in
Bangladesh. Murder, alcohol and drugs caused many of their
early deaths, according to the study, published in the New
England Journal of Medicine. But the leading cause was
cardiovascular disease.
   No one knows exactly what is loading the heart-disease
dice against blacks. But there are plenty of probable
culprits.
   Surveys have shown that the smoking rate among black men
is 8% to 9% higher than among white men, although the rates
have been dropping for both groups. Another factor may be
diet: In one survey, a third of inner-city black mothers said
frying was their first choice among methods of preparing
food. About half of black women and a third of black men in
the U.S. are overweight -- a risk factor for heart disease --
compared with about a fourth of white men and women,
according to federal statistics.
   U.S. blacks are about 40% more likely than whites to have
high blood pressure. Smoking and other life-style choices --
coupled with the stress of growing up in ghettos -- often are
cited as possible causes. Government programs since the 1960s
have helped alleviate blacks' hypertension. But the problem
is far from licked.
   "I remember one black lady with hypertension who literally
smiled when she had to go on dialysis," making her eligible
for government medical benefits, says Neil Shulman, a
hypertension researcher at Emory University. "She said, `At
least now I can afford to get my blood-pressure medicine.'"
   The case illustrates the most disturbing, and perhaps most
important, underlying reason for blacks' high heart-disease
mortality -- their frequent lack of access to sorely needed
medicines and treatment. In a national survey reported last
year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 30%
of blacks with hypertension said they hadn't had an annual
blood-pressure check, compared with 19% of whites. The same
survey found that about half of blacks went to hospital
emergency rooms or other group-care settings for treatment,
compared with about a fourth of whites.
   For Mr. Jones, the man in rural Georgia, the health-care
safety net is a county hospital 30 miles away where the
emergency room sometimes gets so crowded it has to turn away
incoming ambulances. Such hospitals can give little
preventive care, notes Esther Bauer, the community-relations
director at Dallas's Parkland Hospital, which gets many poor
black patients. Some people who go to Parkland have to wait
six months for an appointment.
   Not having regular care hurts even more for patients with
chronic heart problems that need "maintaining" with drugs or
corrective procedures, adds Ron Anderson, Parkland's
president. In a 1985 study, Levi Watkins Jr., a cardiac
surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, found that only 56
blacks had had bypass surgery at his medical school between
1972 and 1980, compared with more than 2,500 whites. The
finding means that blacks, who make up 12% of the population
and have at least as much heart disease as whites, were
getting 2% of the bypasses, says Dr. Watkins. Since then,
Johns Hopkins's rate of bypasses in blacks "has become more
representative" of blacks' share of heart disease, he adds.
   Lack of access to care hurts most of all when heart
attacks hit. But just getting to the hospital is often more
of a problem for blacks than for whites. One study, at
Chicago's Cook County Hospital, showed blacks took an average
of three times longer than whites did to reach the hospital
after the onset of heart-attack symptoms. The black patients
in the study traveled to the emergency room by bus or subway
more often than by ambulance. Many apparently didn't realize
at first that their symptoms meant serious trouble.
   One black patient "told us he was driving near the
hospital when he started having chest pains" of a heart
attack, says Richard Cooper, a Loyola University researcher
and co-author of the Cook County study. "But he figured he'd
have to wait six hours to see a doctor if he stopped at the
hospital, so he just went on home."
   The patient survived. But many don't. In another study,
published in 1985 in the American Heart Journal, researchers
found that the out-of-hospital death rate for black men who
had heart attacks in Columbia, S.C., was 1.8 times that of
white men. Various studies indicate blacks' hearts are
generally in worse shape than whites' hearts are by the time
attacks occur. That may partly explain blacks' higher
heart-attack mortality and higher rate of out-of-hospital
deaths.
   Some medical experts say all of these problems can be
attributed to blacks' high poverty rate, rather than to
racial bias in the medical system. But last year, a
groundbreaking study by Harvard University researchers
strongly suggested that the health-care system treats whites
better than blacks, regardless of economics.
   The study showed that in 1985 in Massachusetts hospitals,
whites with heart problems underwent almost twice as many
bypass operations as black heart patients did -- even when
factors such as financial and insurance status were
discounted. The Harvard researchers, Mark Wenneker and Arnold
Epstein, concluded that "race does seem to be important" in
how heart patients are treated.
   Some doctors assert that the Harvard researchers'
conclusion is far too cautious. "Why do we constantly tiptoe
around the heart of the issue?" asks David Hodges, a
cardiologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital.
"Racism is evident" in medical care, he says, adding,
however, that doctors' racial bias in treating patients is
often "subconscious" and "not malicious."
   In any case, black heart patients often wind up seeing
harried white doctors in public hospitals -- a situation
fraught with problems of communication even if racial bias
isn't involved. For instance, poor black patients often
"think they're being used for guinea pigs" for nefarious
experiments when doctors order blood to be withdrawn for
laboratory tests, says LeeRoy McCurley, a doctor at a clinic
affiliated with Dallas's Parkland Hospital. "Or they'll think
we're going to take their blood and sell it." Moreover, such
patients usually have no regular outside doctor acting as
their hospital "advocates" in getting needed treatment, notes
Jacques Carter, a Boston physician.
   Another factor: Black doctors, who might help bridge the
communications gap with black patients, are in short supply.
Alyce Adams, a black cardiologist who practices in a mostly
black neighborhood in Boston, says she is so overwhelmed by
the health problems there that she seldom gets to focus on
her specialty. "Last year, I was the AIDS doctor," she says.
Now she's working to augment screening for prostate cancer in
her area.
   "It's not that there's something magical about minority
physicians," says Clyde Yancy, a black physician with the
University of Texas in Dallas. "But it's important for
doctors to appreciate that some people haven't gotten a break
in life. You have to educate physicians not to be accusatory
or condescending to them."
   Still, whatever racial bias there is among health-care
workers probably is less a factor in blacks' special
heart-disease problems than policy makers are. "Resources
aren't being allocated" to provide medical care for the poor,
says Laurence Watkins, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., cardiologist
and an authority on heart disease in blacks. "It's not so
much a matter of being black or Hispanic or white. It's that
the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer
-- and dying earlier."

   Exercise in Futility:
   If You're Counting on the Stress Test
   To Alert You to Heart Problems, Think Again

   WHEN DONALD PIZZIFERRO, a hard-driving 53-year-old
insurance executive from Bloomingdale, Ill., took a stress
test for heart disease during a routine physical in 1988, the
results were reassuring.
   "I had a little shortness of breath, a little weakness in
the legs" after running on the treadmill, "but basically,
everything was fine," says Mr. Pizziferro, a self-described
"Type A" personality who worked 60 to 70 hours a week for
most of his career. When the electrocardiogram showed his
heart working normally under stress, he says, "I thought,
`Well, gee, I got a clean bill of health,'" and he went back
to work as usual.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Four weeks later, he had a heart attack.
   Unsuspecting, he drove himself to the hospital that night
with an annoying case of nausea. He was stunned when
physicians in the emergency room told him he had had a heart
attack and swept him into intensive care. He has since had
bypass surgery.
   The exercise stress test, one of the most widely used
procedures in predicting heart disease, is also one of the
least reliable. On the average, the test is accurate in
diagnosing coronary-artery disease only 65% of the time; in
some age and gender groups, the test has a lower accuracy
rate than a coin flip.
   Such inaccuracy carries a high price. False positives can
have crippling effects on people who thought they were
healthy -- leading to unnecessary, and perhaps dangerous,
follow-up testing. False negatives can keep patients from
undergoing lifesaving surgery, discourage them from adopting
life-style changes, and make it easier for them to deny their
symptoms.
   "People who want a stress test to see whether they have
coronary-artery disease should realize that they may end up
with the proverbial can of worms," says James L. Weiss,
associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine.
   Few people do realize that, however, and the popularity of
the stress test is growing fast, particularly among aging
baby boomers worried about the nation's No. 1 killer. The
procedure, which entails walking or running on a treadmill
with electrocardiogram monitors attached to the chest, is
simple to administer and is cheap, costing about $165 to
$300. It's also non-invasive and safe, causing problems in
only about one in 10,000 cases. The most accurate, widely
available alternative, angiography, which entails inserting
catheters through blood vessels, injecting a dye and getting
an image of the heart, is expensive, costing more than $3,000
per procedure. Angiograms also can be traumatic and
occasionally are fatal.
   Moreover, the stress test is a valuable tool for some
patients. It is more accurate in patients who already have a
high likelihood of cardiovascular disease, including men over
45 and women over 55 with high cholesterol or blood pressure,
or a family history of heart disease. It can be helpful in
supervising or planning an exercise program for people who
have had a heart attack or heart surgery.
   Ken Cooper, president of the Aerobics Research Institute,
a not-for-profit fitness center in Dallas, says many stress
tests prove wrong because the test giver doesn't make the
subject work hard enough on the treadmill or fails to monitor
the test or interpret the results correctly.
   Clearly, though, the stress test is more limited than many
patients realize. Positive results, reflected in abnormal
electrocardiogram readings, actually reflect coronary-artery
disease only 60% to 70% of the time. Negative readings are
accurate only about 75% of the time. In some groups, such as
women without symptoms, positive readings may be correct only
40% of the time.
   Test results are even less helpful in predicting symptoms
in symptomless people. A recent Baltimore study showed that
only 19% of 726 symptomless people who had positive stress
test results suffered angina, a heart attack or cardiac death
within 6.4 years. Other research indicates that the majority
of people who die suddenly of heart disease without first
exhibiting symptoms will test negative on the treadmill, says
Daniel B. Mark, cardiologist at Duke University Medical
Center.
   "There's no good way, with 1990s technology, to find those
people," Dr. Mark says.
   Nevertheless, demand for the exercise test remains strong.
Many patients walk into their doctor's office and demand one.
Some health clubs require them of members. Cardio-Fitness
Corp., a chain of health clubs, asks members over 35 to get a
stress test from their physician. While the tests yield some
false results, "it's the best you can do" to protect members
and guard against liability, says Jerome Zuckerman, president
of the New York-based chain.
   The test is lucrative for doctors, providing an added
incentive. "It's a test that many physicians are doing
without a clear understanding of the limitations and
indications for the procedure," says James Rippe, head of the
exercise and physiology laboratory at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School.
   Public demand for the test is fostering some large-scale
rip-offs of insurers. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty and two other
insurers recently won an $18 million judgment against two
California men who were operating 240 mobile testing labs.
The men were administering unnecessary stress tests, among
other things, to thousands of patients, says Aetna, which is
planning to study whether it should set standards of review
for the procedure.
   "The test is being used by a lot of rascals to feather
their economic beds," says John H. Renner, president of the
Consumer Health Information Research Institute, a Kansas City
health-fraud watchdog.
   The problem springs in part from the heart's remarkable
ability to mask its symptoms. For about half the people with
heart disease, the first symptom is a heart attack.
Conversely, chest pain isn't a reliable indicator of serious
cardiac problems.
   Stress testing offers a way to provoke the heart into
revealing the effects of coronary-artery disease. The patient
exercises to exhaustion, to a maximum heart rate for his or
her age, or until chest pains occur. The blood pressure is
checked periodically during and after the test, while the
physician watches the electrocardiogram.
   But the heart can send cryptic signals. A long list of
pre-existing conditions can cause false results, including
hypertension and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as
the use of some medications. Also, a partially obstructed
vessel might work fine during a stress test, then rupture the
next day, causing instant death.
   Physical exertion became increasingly difficult in recent
years for Claudine Johnston, a St. George, S.C., housewife;
she finally got to the point that she could barely cross the
street without feeling nauseated and out of breath. But she
passed two stress tests. By the time her family persuaded her
to undergo angiography at age 70 a couple of months ago,
three of the vessels to her heart were obstructed and she
needed bypass surgery.
   The test's unreliability makes the supervision of a
skilled physician even more crucial. A suburban Chicago
construction executive who was suffering chest pain during
exercise complained repeatedly to his doctors, who cited his
negative stress-test results as proof that his heart was
fine. He switched in exasperation to a veteran cardiologist,
who ordered an angiogram. The diagnosis: coronary artery
disease, with a need for angioplasty.
   "He was frustrated that nobody would believe him," says
the cardiologist, Arvind Menon of Highland Park Hospital in
Highland Park, Ill., who has been conducting stress tests for
24 years, although he interprets them with a great deal of
circumspection. "Time and again he told me this was
happening, and I had to listen to him. One can never ignore
the patient."
   Alternatives to the exercise stress test all have major
drawbacks. They are significantly more expensive, and most of
them carry greater risk.
   All of which leaves physicians continuing to grapple with
the shortcomings of the stress test. "If someone could
develop a noninvasive, 100% accurate test for the presence of
cardiovascular disease that is also cheap, it would be a
great service to humanity," says Irwin Silverman, an
associate in clinical medicine at Northwestern University.
   Most, however, hold out little hope. "People who have no
symptoms but who want to be able to say with certainty, `Do I
have heart disease or not?' are chasing a chimera -- a
ghost," says the University of Massachusetts's Dr. Rippe.
"The medical profession shouldn't fall into the trap of
trying to give people certainty where there is precious
little.
   "The future lies not in developing ever more sophisticated
tests," he adds, "but in using our knowledge of exercise to
encourage people to adopt life styles that will lower their
likelihood of getting heart disease in the first place."

   Stuart-James, Penny Stock Broker,
   Fined $1.9 Million for Overcharges

   NEW YORK -- One of the nation's largest penny-stock
brokerage firms was fined $1.9 million for overcharging
customers and agreed to stop making markets in a broad range
of low-priced stocks.
   The fine against Stuart-James Co., Denver, is the largest
ever imposed on a member firm by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory body for the
over-the-counter stock market. Also fined were Stuart-James's
president, its head trader and a former chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The case, which the firm settled without admitting or
denying wrongdoing, comes amid growing pressure in Washington
for a crackdown on penny-stock frauds. The NASD said that
Stuart-James marked up four low-priced stocks between 6.9%
and 153% in selling them to investors.
   Sarah Ackerson, chief of a Securities and Exchange
Commission unit set up to curb market manipulation, called
the settlement a "significant step" in cracking down on
penny-stock fraud and in protecting investors from excessive
markups. The settlement doesn't affect a continuing SEC
investigation of Stuart-James and its top officials, said
Robert Davenport, the SEC's regional administrator in Denver.
   In settling with the NASD, Stuart-James agreed to several
remedial actions. According to the settlement, the firm will:
   -- Not trade or underwrite so-called "blind pool" or
"blank check" companies.
   -- Send written notice to customers of the highest bid and
lowest asked prices for stocks when they are traded.
   -- Seek other independent dealers in underwriting
securities.
   -- Undergo surveillance of its markup practices by an
independent consultant.
   One surprising part of the settlement was the disclosure
that as of last Jan. 1, Stuart-James quietly stopped making
markets in penny stocks that aren't traded on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System.
It is still making markets in stocks on Nasdaq (these stocks
are required to meet certain financial criteria).
   An attorney for Stuart-James said the lost business isn't
significant for the firm, which he said represented only 3%
of its revenue before Jan. 1.
   Stuart-James attorney Peter Gadkowski conceded the
regulatory scrutiny of penny-stock trading has hurt the
brokerage firm's business. The firm now has 1,000 brokers and
40 branch offices, down from 1,350 brokers and 47 branch
offices two years ago, Mr. Gadkowski said. Penny stocks are
those issues generally priced under $1 a share.
   However, he said in the past few years Stuart-James has
moved to "upgrade the nature of the (initial public)
offerings we're doing from start-up situations to companies
more seasoned and in need of mezzanine financing."
   Mr. Gadkowski also contended that Stuart-James stopped
making markets in penny stocks not listed on Nasdaq because
of a new SEC regulation cracking down on "cold calls" to
first-time investors, not because of the settlement talks
with NASD, which began last fall.
   But John Pinto, NASD vice president of compliance,
disagreed with that interpretation. "Their agreement with us
is far broader" than the regulation of first-time customers,
said Mr. Pinto. "You could be a customer for five years
dealing with non-Nasdaq stocks," and no longer be able to
trade through Stuart-James, he explained. "They're out of
that business."
   The action taken against the brokerage firm's top
officials included: a $105,000 fine against James Padgett,
president and sole shareholder; a $25,000 fine against Stuart
Graff, former chairman; and a $30,000 fine against Steven
Pata, head trader.
   Mr. Padgett also cannot act as a supervisor over the
markup area for six months. Mr. Graff was suspended from
acting as a principal for 60 days. Mr. Pata was suspended in
all capacities for 20 days.
   Mr. Padgett referred calls to the attorney, Mr. Gadkowski.
Messrs. Graff and Pata couldn't be reached for comment
yesterday.

   BANGKOK, Thailand -- A group led by Canada's Lavalin Inc.
appears likely to win the 40 billion baht ($1.54 billion)
contract for Skytrain, Bangkok's long-delayed and
much-contested mass-transit system, if it can get financial
guarantees within two weeks.
   On Wednesday, a committee appointed by Interior Minister
Banharn Silpa-Archa decided Lavalin International Group
should build the elevated mass-transit system and operate it
for 30 years before handing it over to the government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Lavalin must secure commercial-bank guarantees for 800
million Canadian dollars (US$686.4 million) in financing.
Government-owned Export Development Corp. of Canada offered
the group that amount at concessional terms if Lavalin can
secure guarantees for it. The Thai Finance Ministry said
guarantees must be obtained by May 24. But some observers of
the project pointed out that mass-transit systems generally
lose money, and said banks may be reluctant to provide the
guarantees.
   Burin Borriboon, deputy managing director of Sino-Thai
Engineering &amp; Construction Co., one of Lavalin's Thai
partners, conceded that "it will still be a scramble" to
secure the guarantees in two weeks because they probably will
require approval from the boards of participating
international banks. But he said he is confident that Lavalin
will be able to meet the May 24 deadline.

   Counting Cholesterol

   WHAT HAPPENS to coronary risk as the cholesterol count
goes up? It depends on where it was to begin with, how much
it goes up -- and what kind of cholesterol is involved.
   Coronary-artery disease is rare in populations with an
average of 150 milligrams of total cholesterol per deciliter
of blood, a level that researchers consider the practical
ideal. (The U.S. average, according to one study: 218
milligrams.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The incidence of coronary disease rises fairly slowly as
cholesterol moves toward 200. Above that level, however, the
incidence begins to curve upward sharply, and at 240
milligrams the curve gets even steeper. This means that a
large number of Americans are already at high risk. Up to one
in four of them has a cholesterol count above 240.
   One major complicating factor: The count includes two
varieties of cholesterol, called LDL and HDL. Patients with
the same total count may have very different proportions of
HDL and LDL -- and very different degrees of coronary risk.
   Doctors are particularly concerned about patients who show
a high level of LDL, which does the artery-clogging, and a
low amount of HDL, which is now believed to offer some
protection against heart disease rather than contributing to
it.
   Ideally, say researchers, the "bad" LDL ought to be no
more than 100 milligrams and the "good" HDL above 40. Anyone
with an LDL count over 160 ought to be on a low-fat,
low-cholesterol diet regardless of what the HDL is, doctors
say. And anyone with an LDL count of 140 and an HDL of less
than 40 ought to consider doing the same.

   Heart patients who smoke are more likely to cut back on
cigarettes if they see the X-ray movies of their clogged
arteries.
   Researchers at the University of Virginia showed 36
smokers the movies made of their coronary arteries during
angiography, when a fluid visible on X-rays flows through the
arteries, revealing sections where blood flow is restricted
by fatty deposits. Another 36 smokers were shown only
drawings of their clogged arteries. One to two years later,
most of the smokers in both groups had cut back on
cigarettes.
   But among 17 of the smokers who underwent coronary-bypass
surgery, those who saw only drawings of their clogged
coronaries resumed their old smoking habits after surgery.
Bypass patients who viewed the actual films of their
arteries, however, kept away from cigarettes, particularly if
the films showed two or three arteries were clogged.
                                                                                                       

   AUTOMATIC SHOCK
                                                                                                       

   The widely hailed implantable, automatic defibrillator to
stop irregular heart beats does, indeed, save and prolong
lives.
   The implantable defibrillator, which automatically
delivers a shock to the heart when it detects a
life-threatening change in the heartbeat, was invented at
Johns Hopkins's medical school in 1980. It was put on the
market in 1985.
   So far the device has been implanted in about 7,000
patients at 100 medical centers around the world. A new study
shows that 94% are still alive five years later and 85% are
alive 10 years after implantation, says Levi Watkins of Johns
Hopkins. The 10-year survival rate shows the defibrillator is
"the most signigicant advance in the treatment of malignant
cardiac arrhythmias in this decade," Dr. Watkins says.
   The device costs about $15,000, and implanting it costs
another $15,000. About 4% of the patients die as a result of
the surgery, and 5% more develop complications that require a
second operation. New lithium batteries have to be installed
every two years in the generator that is implanted in the
abdomen.
                                                                                                       

   LOVE AND DEATH
                                                                                                       

   Will sex kill me? It's a question that haunts many a
patient recovering from a heart attack.
   Sexual intercourse places about the same degree of demand
on the heart as walking briskly or climbing two flights of
stairs, say three University of Florida doctors in the
journal Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality. "Generally, if a
patient can walk on a treadmill at more than two miles per
hour at a 10% grade" without any significant increase in
blood pressure or adverse changes in the electrocardiogram,
then "his/her exercise capacity should be sufficient to allow
for safe sexual relations with the usual partner," they
write.
   For some anxious patients, a drug taken just before
intercourse might prevent the chest pains and reassure the
patients, they suggest. However, they add, "patients should
also be aware that extramarital sex has been associated with
a higher risk of sudden death."
                                                                                                       

   BIGGER THAN BUSH
                                                                                                       

   The heart gets heavy news coverage even without a
publicist. A computerized search through an electronic data
base of The Wall Street Journal's news pages found there were
433 separate news articles in 1989 that mentioned the heart,
at least as it related to medical matters. That's more
articles in the Journal's pages last year than those that
mentioned George Bush (397), Donald Trump (230), Michael
Milken (235), mutual funds (296), or cancer (265). Some
subjects, of course, received more attention. There were 597
articles that mentioned IBM, and more than 2,000 discussed
inflation.
                                                                                                       

   MYSTERY UNMASKED
                                                                                                       

   The riddle of "Syndrome X" may have been solved.
   Syndrome X is characterized by chest pains similar to
those seen in coronary heart disease, but X-ray angiographic
studies fail to find any evidence of clogged coronary
arteries. The patients are hypersensitive to the catheter
that is threaded into the heart's coronary arteries during
the angiography procedure, a reaction rarely seen in coronary
heart-disease patients. Syndrome X patients often have
dysfunction of the esophagus and asthma-like constriction of
the bronchial passages.
   The syndrome is seen in about 100,000 new patients every
year; about two-thirds are women.
   "Many are labeled neurotic or hysterical when they do have
pain," says Richard O. Cannon III, a researcher with the
National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute. "They've been
mislabeled and dealt with poorly by health-care
professionals."
   Dr. Cannon and other scientists now believe Syndrome X is
caused by abnormalities of blood vessels that are too small
to be seen by X-ray angiography. These tiny vessels serve the
so-called smooth muscles, which include not only the arteries
but also such tissues as the esophagus and bronchial tubes.
Some of the same drugs that relieve coronary-artery disease
seem to help many Syndrome X patients.
   The researchers now call the condition "microvascular
angina." Because it involves more than just angina-like chest
pains, microvascular angina might not be the best name, says
Dr. Cannon. But, he adds, "patients prefer it to Syndrome X."
                                                                                                       

   CHOLESTEROL CONFUSION
                                                                                                       

   So you think your cholesterol level is, say, 210? Not
anymore. It's now 5.43.
   In an example of monumentally bad timing, medical journals
changed the standard measuring unit for blood-cholesterol
levels just as the National Cholesterol Education Program
began its huge education effort to make the public aware of
the cholesterol-heart disease link.
   The core of the NCEP -- a joint effort of the federal
government and private industry -- is guidelines on "risk
levels" of cholesterol in the blood, stated in milligrams of
cholesterol per deciliter of blood plasma, the fluid part of
the blood. A level below 200 is considered a "normal" risk;
above 240 milligrams per deciliter is considered a high risk.
   Grams and liters are metric measurements that medical
journals have been using for years for weights and volumes
respectively. But about three years ago, U.S. medical
journals began switching to the Systeme International
d'Unites, or SI, the international system of measuring units.
   In the SI, the proper units for stating the concentration
of a substance in a volume is moles per liter, the mole being
a standard number of atoms, molecules or particles. Thus,
blood-cholesterol levels are now stated in millimoles per
liter of blood plasma. A cholesterol level of 210 milligrams
per deciliter is now officially 5.43 millimoles per liter.
   The change upsets some doctors. "We must not force
physicians to learn one system to be able to read the medical
literature and then have them translate the values into
another language that can be understood by the public," one
distressed doctor wrote the editor of the New England Journal
of Medicine.
                                                                                                       

   AFTER THE ATTACK
                                                                                                       

   You show up at your hospital with chest pains and after a
series of tests, your fears are confirmed: You've had a heart
attack or an attack of angina. What happens next?
   Based on 35,000 such cases at Ohio State University
Hospitals in Columbus, here's a look at what to expect:
   -- About 20% of patients diagnosed with heart disease have
bypass surgery.
   -- 15% are referred for coronary angioplasty.
   -- About 45% to 55% are treated with drugs, which
successfully alleviate symptoms for at least several years.
   -- An additional 20% are treated initially with drugs,
half of whom come back for either angioplasty or bypass when
the drugs don't work. The rest are too sick for either
surgery or balloon treatment, and drugs are their only
option.

   Drugs of the Future:
   By the End of the Century, Companies Will Be Testing
   Medicines That Reverse the Course of Heart Disease

   WHEN IT COMES to searching for new treatments for heart
disease, U.S. pharmaceutical makers aren't pikers. In 1988
they invested nearly one-third of the $6.5 billion they spent
on all research and development looking for medicines for the
heart.
   The incentives are huge. Nearly 66 million Americans, or
one in four, suffer some type of cardiovascular problem, and
more than one million people are expected to die from such
ailments this year. Last year, 48 drug companies were
developing 91 medicines to treat patients with diseased
hearts and coronary arteries, hypertension and stroke.

   For all the work in the field, none of these experimental
compounds are cures. At best, these medicines are more potent
and produce fewer side effects than existing therapies. None
of them can reverse the damage to the heart and its arteries
caused by decades of high blood pressure, the clogging of
arteries by fatty plaques or the killing of heart muscle
caused by a heart attack.
   But scientists say advances taking place in a few dozen
laboratories suggest that by the end of the century drug
makers will be testing medicines designed to reverse the
course of disease.
   "The important new drugs in the future won't just
ameliorate disease but, instead, will prevent the
physiological changes that, over time, lead to high blood
pressure, heart attacks and angina," says Jay Cohn, a leading
heart-disease researcher at the University of Minnesota
School of Medicine. "Such drugs will profoundly affect the
frequency of disease by inhibiting disease at the most basic,
cellular level in the body."
   Driving this optimism is the rapid pace at which
scientists are uncovering the inner workings of cells that,
when in proper condition, keep the cardiovascular system
running efficiently. Principal targets for this research are
receptors, spikelike chemicals on the surface of cells
through which hormones and enzymes control thousands of
minute actions taking place instantaneously.
   It is widely believed that defects in these receptors,
often caused by mutated genes, underlie most heart disease.
The important heart drugs of the future will repair these
defects, scientists predict.
   Scientists are convinced the decadeslong buildup of fatty
deposits that eventually block blood flow to the heart --
causing angina and heart attacks -- occurs only in people
born with one of about a dozen receptor defects. The most
effective drugs now under study for lowering cholesterol work
by coaxing certain receptors to soak up excess cholesterol in
the bloodstream. Already one such drug is available --
Mevacor, produced Merck &amp; Co. A half-dozen similar drugs are
in advanced stages of testing.
   "The challenge to developing even better drugs is to get
at the other receptors involved in normal cholesterol
processing," says Edgar Haber, the director of research at
Bristol-Myers Squibb Corp. "If we knew exactly which
receptors were defective in an individual, we could tailor
very potent drugs that, given early in life, would go a long
way toward preventing disease."
   Dr. Haber says researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb also
are chasing after cell receptors that normally regulate the
musclelike tissue surrounding coronary arteries. Drugs that
can affect these receptors, thereby relaxing the muscle
tissue, could keep the arteries from constricting, thus
treating a common type of angina. It is hoped that these
drugs would be targeted specifically at receptors near the
heart, thus avoiding the side effects of current
vessel-dilating drugs that work throughout the body.
   Researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Upjohn Co.,
SmithKline Beecham PLC. and elsewhere have been racing for
several years to create drugs that would block the action of
renin, a kidney hormone. Renin is known to turn on numerous
receptors that control cells involved in the pumping action
of the heart. Scientists believe a renin-inhibiting drug
would be a potent treatment for high blood pressure and also
would reduce the workload burdening hearts that have been
severely weakened by a heart attack.
   To date, the hunt for a useful renin blocker has failed.
Instead, scientists now are pursuing compounds that interact
directly with the renin receptors. It might be possible to
administer such drugs beginning early in life to repair
inborn receptor defects.
   But, the scientists say, breakthroughs in receptor
technology must also be accompanied by better methods at
detecting which individuals have specific receptor defects.
One technique will rely on the growing ability for scientists
to test a person's genetic material to determine whether a
gene responsible for the production of a particular receptor
is damaged. Another technique will depend on whether
scientists can create imaging devices that can see the
buildup of artery plaque or constricted vessels years before
the first dangerous signs of disease appear.
   "When that happens, and most everyone in the field
believes it will," says Dr. Cohn of Minnesota, "we will have
moved into a new age of disease prevention much better than
anything we can do now."

   Believes the pain of angina by opening coronary arteries,
thus increasing blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle.
(Drug is available in many forms -- in a chewable dosage, in
a form to be placed under the tongue, or topically, as a
cream or through a Band-Aid-like skin patch.)
                                                                                                       

   Advantages: Inexpensive and fast-working; no serious side
effects.
   Disadvantages: Except for patches, the drug can't prevent
angina attacks. Patches loses effectiveness if used more than
12 hours at a time. Can cause dizziness, flushing of face,
headache and restlessness.

   Coalition Pushes for Plumbing Device
   To Help Prevent Accidental Scaldings

   WASHINGTON -- A nationwide campaign to reduce burns from
scalding baths and showers could change plumbing industry
practices and provide a windfall to a small Connecticut
metals company.
   About 5,000 children are scalded by water each year. The
victims are generally young children who are burned
accidentally in the bathtub. Many require expensive
hospitalization and painful skin grafts; some die. Elderly
and handicapped bathers are also particularly susceptible to
hot-water burns, which often occur because many residential
water heaters are set too high.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plumbing industry has moved slowly to address this
problem. Although anti-scald devices have been available for
many years, "72% of all bathtub and shower valves sold today
still have no safety or scald protections incorporated into
their design," says William Kamela, the director of public
policy for the National Safe Kids Campaign. In mid-May, Safe
Kids, a child safety organization whose chairman is former
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, plans to launch a campaign
to reduce scalds.
   Safe Kids is working through local coalitions across the
nation to try to win changes in building codes to require the
installation of valves that will shut off water that suddenly
turns dangerously hot. The campaign highlights a safety valve
made by Memry Corp., a small Norwalk, Conn., company.
   The firm makes scald-protection devices that automatically
shut off hot water exceeding 120 degrees (comfortable bath
water runs between 100 degrees and 105 degrees). Safe Kids
argues that safety valves offer the best protection against
water heaters that are set too high or sudden blasts of hot
water that often occur when toilets are flushed in the same
building. On many older water heaters, the temperatures are
set at 140 degrees or higher.
   For both Safe Kids and Memry, their combination is like a
marriage made in heaven. The Memry valves, sold under the
names Shower Gard and Flow Gard, retail for under $20 and are
simple for homeowners to install. More traditional safety
valves cost several times more and require installation by a
plumber.
   The safety campaign, which will include nationwide
advertising and education efforts, promises immediate
benefits to Memry Corp. and its relatively unheralded
products. "There's a great potential. There are 175 million
showers out there," says Stephen Fisher, Memry's president.
Company officials note that when Safe Kids focused on bicycle
safety last year, sales of bicycle helmets nearly doubled.
   (Memry's last moment in the spotlight was considerably
less pleasant. In 1988, the company, then called Memory
Metals Inc., settled Securities and Exchange Commission
charges that it had issued misleading news releases while
under different management. Earlier, the company had been the
target of a stock manipulation scheme.)
   Memry is currently scrambling to open channels with such
major retailers as Wal-Mart and K mart. At the same time,
it's trying to interest large plumbing fixture companies in
designing safety faucets around the core of its product -- a
metal alloy spring that rapidly expands to shut off the water
flow as temperatures approach 120 degrees and then returns to
its original shape as temperatures drop.
   One criticism of the safety promotion is that it is
promoting one company's product. Earlier this year, Safe Kids
appeared before the Council of American Building Officials,
which issues a model national building code for one and two
family dwellings, to request a code amendment that would
require showers and tubs in new construction to include "a
point of use temperature sensing device" that shuts off water
flow at 120 degrees. But the council rejected the request, in
part because of concerns that only the Memry product
satisfies that definition. Safe Kids will make another
appearance before the group later this year and seek similar
amendments from other code-drafting bodies.
   Both Safe Kids and Memry acknowledge that the company has
contributed to the anti-scald campaign. But Mr. Kamela says
this hasn't influenced the organization. "We have a $2
million budget. They contributed $15,000," he says. Safe Kids
was established by the Children's National Medical Center in
Washington, and receives most of its funds from Johnson &amp;
Johnson.
   Over the past decade, some concerned doctors and public
health officials around the country have fought with mixed
success to persuade people to turn down their hot water
heaters and to win laws requiring hot water heater
manufacturers to set temperatures lower.
   For years, water-heater makers and plumbers had generally
set water heaters at 140 degrees or higher. At 140 degrees,
water can give a child third-degree burns in three seconds
and scald an adult in five seconds, according to Murray
Katcher, the director of maternal and child health in the
Wisconsin Division of Health. The risk of scalding declines
sharply with water temperatures. "Generally, in the 120-130
range, people are safe," Dr. Katcher says.
   In 1988, after Wisconsin and several other states passed
laws requiring water heater settings at 120 or 125 degrees,
the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, a group that
represents makers of both gas and electric water heaters,
agreed to recommend settings of 120 degrees and to put scald
warning labels on all heaters. But because only about 10% of
the nation's water heaters are replaced each year, most water
is still too hot, Dr. Katcher says.
   Thus, anti-scald groups are pushing safety valves.
"Education isn't nearly as successful as a passive means of
prevention," Dr. Katcher explains.

   HONG KONG -- Stock prices aren't the only things that have
been falling on many Asian-Pacific markets.
   Trading activity has been shrinking, too, a fact many
analysts say indicates increasing uncertainty about where
regional share prices are headed for the rest of this year.

   Tokyo's market, which has been buffeted by a falling yen
and rising interest rates, has stabilized after sharp falls
earlier this year. The Nikkei stock average stands 22.5%
below its level at the end of last year. Volume, measured by
the average value of shares traded each day, dropped sharply
in March and April as investors waited for prices to
stabilize. In January, average daily turnover was about $6.5
billion; by April, the level had dropped 27% to about $4.8
billion.
   While many investors have focused on the travails of
Japanese shares, volume has been ebbing on many of the
region's other markets as well. Through April, the value of
shares traded on an average day was lower than the January
levels on six of 10 regional markets. Included on the list of
volume laggards were some of last year's stellar performers:
Singapore; Bangkok, Thailand; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and
Taiwan, each of whose share prices rose at least 40% in 1989.
Also on the list were two underperformers: Australia, which
rose about 11% last year, and Seoul, South Korea, which had a
flat 1989.
   "Volumes on the whole are contracting," says David
Harding, a director at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. "You
can argue that that's bullish or bearish. There's no crash
around the corner, but people certainly are cautious."
   Fund managers and brokers agree that shrinking volumes
indicate growing investor uncertainty. There is no consensus,
however, about whether the slowing in volume signals a
decline or an increase in share prices.
   In a long-term bull market, falling prices accompanied by
light volume usually are a good sign. Investors refuse to
sell because they are confident that share prices will resume
their rise after a correction.
   For the most part, that is what has happened in the
developing markets of the Asian-Pacific region. Despite
periods of sharp corrections, share prices are far above
their levels of a decade ago. And between 1979 and 1989,
trading levels ballooned tremendously, so volume today
remains high by historical standards even if it is slacking
off in some markets.
   But in the late stages of bull markets, shrinking volume
and falling prices sometimes signal that investors are losing
confidence. Potential sellers hesitate because they are
hoping for a rebound. Potential buyers hold back because they
fear that share prices will fall further.
   The problem for investors is deciding whether the recent
contraction in trading indicates that a bear actually is
stalking regional markets. Most brokers and fund managers
think not. But many believe that prices on numerous exchanges
in the region are vulnerable to some wild swings,
particularly if trading picks up after the spate of regional
holidays that ended with last week's Golden Week in Japan.
   "Sustained declines on low volume mean that people are
holding stock they bought at higher prices," says Timothy
Moe, regional research director at Jardine Fleming Securities
Ltd. "That makes overhead resistance powerful because selling
pressure hasn't been vented."
   Analysts say share prices also are being restrained by a
muddled outlook for the world economy. Inflation and rising
interest rates are dogging the world's big economies, but
there is no convincing sign that any of them is sliding into
recession. Despite the Tokyo market's sharp fall this year,
Wall Street hasn't followed suit. Corporate earnings
world-wide are generally down, but enthusiasm is high for
European equities as Eastern Europe enters the capitalist
camp.
   "It amazes me the way people around the world focus on
different things," says Rick Schmidt, a broker at BT
Brokerage (Asia) Ltd. "Right now, it adds up to uncertainty
and a lack of interest in most Asian markets. There's nothing
to get excited about, so things sort of drift."
   Stewart Aldcroft, a director at Wardley Investment
Services Ltd., observes that the slackening volumes in some
markets are an indication that investors are content to sit
on their regional holdings despite an uncertain short-term
outlook.
   "It depends on the individual market," he says. "I
personally think any increase in volume is likely to be
positive for prices, but there is the outside chance that
investors will decide to dump stocks."

   Outlook is Cloudy
   For Some Nations
   Not Part of EC

   BRUSSELS -- Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Austria and other
Western European countries outside the European Community
could become an investment backwater, according to a new
survey of business plans of European and U.S. companies.
   The survey, carried out by the large international
management consulting firm KPMG, shows that both European and
U.S. companies expect more business opportunities in the
European Community and Eastern Europe, at the expense of the
other Western European nations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the poll carried out in March and April, only
12% of U.S. companies and 19% of European companies have
plans to increase their trade or investment with Switzerland,
Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland or Iceland -- the six
members of the European Free Trade Association. Meanwhile,
more than half of all companies surveyed plan to increase
trade within the EC, and 35% plan increases somewhere in
Eastern Europe.
   The findings, based on interviews with executives at 108
leading U.S. and European companies, help explain the
persistent worries by the EFTA nations about the EC's 1992
program and other changes in Europe. Fearing that they will
be left behind by a more dynamic EC, the EFTA nations have
been trying to make sure they have full access to the 1992
single market. Austria has applied for membership in the EC
and some experts predict that Norway -- and perhaps even
Sweden and Switzerland -- could follow.
   The EFTA countries have also pushed the EC for creating an
18-nation free-trade zone, known as the European Economic
Space. Formal talks on this subject moved a step closer this
week when the EC Commission approved its negotiating
position. But such talks, which are scheduled to begin in
June, are likely to be highly divisive because of a
reluctance of the EC to allow the EFTA to participate in EC
decision-making. The EFTA is also unlikely to agree to a full
opening of its markets to the EC countries.
   Such complications for the EFTA, the KPMG survey suggests,
could be good news for Eastern Europe, though. About a third
of European companies and 28% of U.S. companies say they have
specific plans to expand their business relations there. The
findings also suggest that the opening of Eastern Europe has
had a dramatic effect on strategic planning by large
companies: Seven out of 10 companies say that events in
Eastern Europe have affected their business plans -- 29% by a
large extent.
   "This is clearly a whole new set of business issues that
now has to be considered along with the (EC's) single
market," said Clive Stanbrook, a legal consultant for KPMG,
commenting on the survey results.
   "Top business brains on both sides of the Atlantic are
clearly taking a great interest in Eastern Europe," added
Scott Cormack, head of the Brussels-based KPMG European
Business Center.

   There Are No `Wrong' Immigrants

   George J. Borjas ("The U.S. Takes the Wrong Immigrants,"
editorial page, April 5) is certainly right that the U.S.
could select immigrants who would make even greater economic
contributions than does our current system. And it is worth
his saying that most immigrants get admitted as relatives of
U.S. residents rather than because of their merits. But Mr.
Borjas's article also leaves some unfortunate and incorrect
impressions, and invites dangerous misinterpretation.
   It is easy to infer from the article that less-skilled
immigrants have a negative economic effect. But nothing in
Mr. Borjas's recent book shows that to be true. He shows only
that they make a less positive contribution than the more
skilled.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He writes that the immigrants from some countries are less
productive than those from others. To some readers this will
suggest that the U.S. should discriminate on the basis of
origin. But discrimination on the basis of education would
accomplish exactly the same effect.
   Mr. Borjas also writes that the immigrants from some
countries are more likely to be on welfare than others. Here
his data are unsound because they do not hold constant the
length of time in the country. It is not informative that
immigrants from Germany who came on average many years ago
are better off than recent immigrants from Vietnam.
   More generally, focusing on origins, or even on
characteristics of individuals, fosters divisiveness and
directs attention away from the key social decision -- the
total number of immigrants admitted. A meaningful increase in
the total number would have a more beneficial effect than
almost any conceivable alteration in the selection system.
   Mr. Borjas also says, "Including illegals, more immigrants
were admitted during the 1980s than in any other decade in
American history." From 1901 to 1910, 8.8 million immigrants
arrived. In the 1980s, 5.9 million immigrants arrived
legally. For the recent flow to be even as large as the
earlier flow, the number of illegal entrants would have to be
larger than experts (e.g. Robert Warren, head of statistics
for INS and a reliable student of the subject) estimate it
could be.
   But even if the flow now were historically larger, so
what? What matters is the flow relative to our population
size, and that more immigrants are good rather than bad for
us -- all kinds of immigrants. The most important change we
can make is to allow more to come.

   Prof. Borjas clearly had my parents in mind. My father
came from Russia in 1919, my mother from Poland the next
year. Neither had a pair of shoes when they arrived. My
father was one of nine children, my mother one of 11. My
mother never learned to write English, but she could handle
movie magazines by the time she was 40. We lived in back of a
candy store in Hoboken, N.J., where I became interested in
foreign languages by learning to say "Please don't hit me
again]" in six of them.
   Our house, which was one large room, had no books, no
records, no signs of intellectual commitment. My parents were
poor, ignorant and never spent a minute in an American school
of any kind. Given Prof. Borjas's standards, they would not
be welcomed to America, nor would their children represent
any particular dividend for this country. This pair of
completely unskilled and uneducated immigrants, however, had
something in them that will never appear in any statistical
analysis of what makes a "right" or "wrong" immigrant. There
are characteristics and values that cannot be charted. This
illiterate woman could read a report card somehow, and I will
never forget the pain of disappointment when she did not see
the letters she wanted, nor the knot in my stomach when she
said, "Your brother did better."

   Marketing &amp; Media:
   News Corp. Says It May Sell to Public
   Part of Hong Kong Newspaper Business

   HONG KONG -- News Corp. said it may sell part of its Hong
Kong newspaper business to the public, in a step that
apparently is in keeping with the Australian media concern's
retrenchment.
   The plan, disclosed in a brief statement, involves the
South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's largest
English-language daily, owned by News Corp. Outside estimates
of the newspaper's value range from four billion to five
billion Hong Kong dollars (US$513 million to US$642 million).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The statement said the plan tentatively "would be effected
by an offer for sale of a proportion of issued capital" of a
company holding News Corp.'s Hong Kong newspaper interests:
the Post and the Sunday Morning Post. It gave no further
details.
   Once listed on the local stock exchange, the Post was
taken private after being acquired in 1986 as part of News
Corp.'s global acquisition binge, which left it with more
than US$6 billion in debt.
   The plan appears to be part of a change in direction by
Rupert Murdoch, the Australian concern's chief executive
officer. In an April interview, Mr. Murdoch said News Corp.
would forgo further major acquisitions for the next two to
three years, work to prop up its sagging earnings, and focus
on its entertainment and media businesses. He denied that he
was under pressure to make major asset sales but did say he
might sell some properties on a selective basis.
   "The fact that {News Corp.} is highly geared in an
environment of rising interest rates requires a fairly tricky
balancing act," said John Mulcahy, research director of
Peregrine Brokerage Ltd., a local securities firm. The plan
would suggest that Mr. Murdoch "wishes to reduce his debt,"
added Mr. Mulcahy, formerly editor of the Post's business
section.
   Phillip Crawley, editor of the Post, declined to respond
to that assessment. Given Mr. Murdoch's high international
profile, Mr. Crawley said, "inevitably people will want to
speculate on why he wants to do this."
   Mr. Crawley focused instead on the public-relations aspect
of the proposal, which he said is aimed at least in part at
diluting local perceptions of the Post as being an
Australian-run publication. To underscore "our local
identity," Mr. Crawley explained, "we feel it would be good
to be a locally listed company again and give people a chance
to share in our success."
   He added that the plan could take place "in weeks" if the
necessary regulatory hurdles are cleared quickly.
   Since being acquired by Mr. Murdoch in late 1986 for about
US$300 million, the newspaper has grown steadily in
circulation and profitability. Its daily circulation stands
at about 103,000 during the week and 85,000 on Sundays.
Outside estimates place the newspaper's earnings last year at
about HK$400 million.
   In accordance with the local stock market's current
performance, new issues are being priced at about 10 times
earnings. That ratio would value the newspaper at HK$4
billion, more than 70% above Mr. Murdoch's acquisition cost.
   A report Thursday in the Hong Kong Economic Journal, a
local Chinese-language newspaper, said News Corp. may sell as
much as 45% of the Post through a combination of a public
offering and a private placement. The report said the plan
may involve the sale of existing stock as well as new shares.
Mr. Crawley declined comment on the report.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.'s 92%-owned
Asamera Minerals Inc. unit said it is withdrawing plans to
sell its assets, citing depressed gold prices.
   The company's main asset is a 51% stake in the Cannon gold
and silver mine at Wenatchee, Wash., which last year produced
150,420 ounces of gold. Asamera said it won't resume efforts
to sell assets until gold prices rise and "the market
recognizes the value" of its holdings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Toronto-based Corona Corp., a big gold producer that
indirectly holds an interest in the Cannon mine through an
affiliate, Breakwater Resources Ltd., previously terminated a
pact under which it would have acquired most of Asamera's
assets, for stock valued at about 98.8 million Canadian
dollars (US$84.8 million). Other rumored bidders have failed
to materialize.
   Vancouver-based Breakwater, in which Corona holds a 27.6%
interest, owns 49% of the Cannon mine.
   Separately, Asamera appointed Russell Wood president and
chief executive, succeeding Bill Cooper, who is retiring. Mr.
Wood was president and chief executive for Copper Range Co.,
of White Pine, Mich., prior to its sale in 1989, Asamera
said.
   Gulf Canada, 74.3%-owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, is
selling certain assets to reduce debt.

   Plans to Unveil
   Superfast Chip

   Motorola Inc. said it plans to introduce Monday a computer
chip it claims runs as fast as some supercomputers and that
can create color video, stereo sound and graphics signals --
the elements of a technology called multimedia.
   Motorola is pitting the new chip, called the 96002,
against arch-rival Intel Corp.'s superfast 80860 chip.
Intel's chip was introduced last year with much fanfare, and
has been a big success in some of the applications at which
Motorola is aiming.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're giving you more processing power for fewer dollars"
than Intel, said Mike Collins, Motorola's marketing manager
for the chip. Over 150 customers world-wide have requested
supplies of the chip, Motorola added.
   But the chip may be handicapped by its lateness to market.
Intel already has signed up some of the customers who might
have designed the Motorola chip into their products, had it
been available last year as was Intel's, said Michael Slater,
editor of Microprocessor Report, a newsletter.
   Although the 96002 does many tasks better than does the
Intel chip, Mr. Slater said, "the prospects would have been
better had it been here a year earlier."
   The Motorola chip's forte will be in computers that
process the huge amounts of digital data needed to represent
moving pictures, voices and three-dimensional graphics using
a technique called digital-signal processing.
   The Schaumburg, Ill., company said that customers already
are designing the chip into products such as color laser
printers, navigation systems to keep track of ships around
the globe and so-called CAT-scanners used by doctors to look
into the human body.
   One company, Ariel Corp., Highland Park, N.J., has
designed the chip into an add-on board meant to let personal
computers perform multimedia tasks by processing sound and
moving-video data, something conventional chips are too slow
to do.
   One of the chip's strengths for multimedia tasks is its
speed in the type of calculation needed for digital-signal
processing. Motorola said the 96002 will process 165 million
operations -- such as addition or multiplication -- every
second; Intel's 80860 runs at only 99 million operations a
second. Another plus is its price: $750 for sample chips that
will be available Monday, or 65% cheaper than Intel's
mass-produced chip, Motorola added.
   The chip is fast in part because it crams in functions
that are usually done by additional chips. It also sports a
unique feature: using a house as an analogy, older chips
crowd incoming and outgoing data through the same front door,
or "port"; Motorola's new chip can take new data through the
front door while sending completed calculations or commands
out the back door.

   Ford Says Incentives,

   Equal 10% of Its Sales

<LP>
   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. said incentives and other
variable marketing costs are now running about 10% of its
sales -- an extremely high rate that works out to be about
$1,000 a vehicle, or $4 billion on an annualized basis.
   The No. 2 auto maker also disclosed at its annual meeting
that it spent $1.2 billion last year on world-wide
advertising. About $644 million of that was spent in the
U.S., with television getting $255 million of the total, $109
million going to magazines and $38 million to newspapers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In other matters from the auto maker's second-shortest
annual meeting at 1 hour 58 minutes:
   -- Ford Chairman Harold A. Poling said government economic
reforms in Brazil and labor disruptions in Europe will
continue to depress the company's earnings in the second
quarter. These two factors hurt first-quarter earnings, which
wound up at $506.2 million, or $1.10 a share. In the
year-earlier first quarter, Ford earned $1.64 billion, or
$3.44 a share.
   Mr. Poling also said the world-wide auto industry's
capacity to build about 8.4 million vehicles this year, or
about 20% more than demand, "will most certainly squeeze
margins" for every auto company.
   -- Ford "would not take exception" to being chosen as the
contract target in negotiations with the United Auto Workers
union this summer, Mr. Poling said in a news conference that
followed the meeting. The UAW usually picks one of the Big
Three auto makers as the target for a pattern-setting
contract that it then tries to get from the two other
companies.
   -- Ford dealers have already taken orders for 100,000 of
the redesigned 1991-model Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer
subcompacts, Ford officials said. Dealers have taken in about
75,000 orders for the new Ford Explorer sport utility
vehicle. Ford has said it expects to sell 500,000 Escorts and
Tracers next year, the first full year the cars will be on
sale. The auto maker expects to sell 100,000 Explorers this
year and 220,000 in 1991.
   -- Ford still plans to spend substantially more in the
next five years than the record $23 billion it spent in the
past five years, including $6.8 billion last year.

   Goldman Is Sued
   Over a Data Base

   NEW YORK -- Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. was hit with another
lawsuit centering on the investment banking firm's commodity
operations.
   Goldman was sued for $9 million by its former
commodity-research group, which is now an independent company
called CPM Group. In a complaint filed in New York state
Supreme Court in Manhattan, CPM claims that Goldman destroyed
a major data base on gold, silver and platinum trends that
CPM and Goldman had shared, in what the suit alleges was a
"conspiracy and scheme" to hurt Goldman competitors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The CPM suit is the second to be filed recently that
focuses on Goldman's large commodity operations. In December,
the former head of Goldman Sachs's oil-futures unit, Leo
Haviland, alleged in a suit in federal court in Manhattan
that he was forced out of his $600,000-a-year job after he
refused Goldman partners' "repeated attempts to extort" him
into divulging confidential information. The suit claimed the
information was about customer accounts, so that the partners
could benefit through Goldman's J. Aron commodity-trading
division.
   Although unrelated, both the Haviland suit and the new one
accuse Goldman of misusing its power to gain advantage in the
markets.
   Goldman has vigorously denied the allegations in the
Haviland suit. And in an answer to the CPM suit filed in
state court, Goldman denies CPM's allegations and asks that
the suit be dismissed. A Goldman spokesman said: "This is a
minor contractual dispute over access to our own library
materials, which in any event the former consultant had no
right to following the termination of the contract in
November 1989."
   CPM, run by former Goldman Vice President Jeffrey M.
Christian, is a consultant and research firm based in New
York. Originally an arm of Goldman, the firm went independent
in 1986, and its clients included, until last year, Goldman
itself. Early this month, the Silver Institute, a trade
group, announced it hired CPM to produce statistical reviews
of the international silver market. CPM also advises mining
companies.
   The CPM suit alleges that Goldman and Goldman partner
Dennis Suskind reneged on an agreement to maintain the big
precious-metal data base, including research files,
periodicals and books. CPM said Goldman was obligated to
maintain the data base and allow CPM to use it, even if CPM's
consulting agreement with Goldman ran out. But the suit
claims the data base was "thrown out and destroyed" without
notice.
   Mr. Suskind declined to comment on the CPM suit beyond the
spokesman's statement.
   CPM is seeking $4 million in damages, mostly for lost
business, and $5 million in punitive damages.

with problem loan identification, and it is likely that lower
profitability in future quarters will result."
   Peter J. Manning, Bank of Boston's chief financial
officer, said that the company is "obviously disappointed" at
the rating change, and that "we stand ready to deal with
uncertainties in the current economic environment."
   For the first quarter, Bank of Boston earned $43.6
million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $89.1 million, or
$1.23 a share, a year earlier.
   S&amp;P said it lowered its ratings on Bank of New England's
senior debt to triple-C from single-B-plus and on its
subordinated debt to double-C from single-B-minus. About $675
million of debt was affected by the rating changes, S&amp;P
added.
   S&amp;P said the Boston-based bank-holding company "has made
strides in coping with its difficult operating environment,
especially in stabilizing its immediate liquidity troubles,
but its viability is dependent on improvement in the regional
economy and continued regulatory forbearance." S&amp;P added that
"given a stringent regulatory environment and general
illiquidity of the parent company, it is likely that bank
holding company creditors will suffer losses."
   For the first quarter, Bank of New England reported a loss
of $46.6 million, or 68 cents a share, including a $124.8
million pretax gain from the sale of assets.
   In Boston, a Bank of New England spokesman said the S&amp;P
downgrade "is not unexpected." He added that the concern "is
current on all of its interest payments. Deposits have
stabilized, and the company is moving forward with its
recovery plan."
   S&amp;P said it lowered its ratings on Fleet/Norstar Financial
Group's senior debt to single-A-minus from single-A-plus,
subordinated debt to triple-B-plus from single-A, preferred
stock to triple-B from single-A-minus, and commercial paper
to A-2 from A-1.
   The issues were removed from CreditWatch, where they were
placed Monday with negative implications, S&amp;P said. About
$2.2 billion of debt was affected.
   S&amp;P said "the downgrades reflect Fleet/Norstar's poor
first-quarter results and substantial rise in nonperforming
assets, which confirm that the New England regional economic
troubles, especially in real estate, have not abated."
   In Providence, R.I., Jack Flynn, Fleet/Norstar's vice
president, finance, said, "We're pleased S&amp;P continues to
rank our {senior} debt in the A category."
   For the first quarter, Fleet/Norstar reported a loss of
$98.1 million, or 92 cents a share.

   South Korea's
   Middle Class
   Angry at Plight

   SEOUL -- South Korea's worries about an "economic crisis"
have become a self-fulfilling prophecy to a growing segment
of the middle class -- and they're fighting mad about it.
   In a country where protests against dictatorship and the
U.S. have become commonplace, the most significant aspect of
Korea's latest outburst of demonstrations is that they focus
more on economic rather than political grievances.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets
across the nation Wednesday to demand the dissolution of the
new ruling Democratic Liberal Party, their appeal was based
on bread-and-butter issues. Banners on the campus of Yonsei
University, the center of anti-government student activity in
Seoul, talked about rising inflation, rampant real-estate
speculation and housing shortages.
   At the same time, swarms of young, middle-class office
workers in suits joined thousands of students and dissidents
in downtown Seoul in taunting riot police and chanting
slogans like: "Save our livelihoods," "Give us houses," and
"Down with dictators and tycoons."
   "People are furious," said a Korean political analyst who
watched the protests escalate. "They see big businessmen
getting richer and richer, and gobbling up all the real
estate in the country, while the middle class can't afford to
buy houses and the poor can't even pay their rent."
   Inflation, fueled mostly by housing costs, is running at
an annual rate of about 14%, up from 6% last year. The
government's Economic Planning Board reports that real-estate
speculation has doubled house prices in the past several
years and is responsible for a 30% rise in land prices in
1989 alone. That has pushed up average rents by 45% in the
past year.
   In recent months, land speculation also has drained about
five trillion won ($7.17 billion) from banks and the stock
market. That caused share prices to plummet in the first four
months of this year, bankrupting hundreds of small investors
and enriching large landholders -- especially insurance and
securities companies owned by big business groups, which have
speculated heavily in real estate. On Thursday, Seoul share
prices plunged 2.7% in response to the political unrest.
   Even the firebombing of the U.S. Information Service, or
USIS, office in the capital Wednesday, while chiefly aimed at
forcing the withdrawal of 43,000 American troops stationed in
Korea, had economic overtones. Radicals demanded that the
U.S. stop pressuring Korea to open its agricultural markets,
which they said would cripple Korean farmers.
   President Roh Tae Woo acknowledged the public
dissatisfaction with his government and party on Monday,
telling a nationwide television audience that neither has
"been able to gain public confidence in the consistency of
its policies."
   As a result, Mr. Roh said, the nation is facing "an array
of political, economic and social difficulties," and he cited
rampant land speculation, a highly volatile stock market,
labor unrest, an export slump and rising crime. He promised a
crackdown on real-estate speculation as his first priority,
and on Tuesday the government announced measures to force
business groups to sell off idle real estate.
   Wednesday's demonstrations were the most violent since
mid-1987, when nationwide riots forced Mr. Roh's friend and
predecessor, Chun Doo Hwan, to abandon his military rule and
promise broad reforms. Mr. Roh was inaugurated to a five-year
term in February 1988.

   Arco Chemical Developing New Products
   In Plan to Double the Size of Its Business

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)

   NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa. -- Arco Chemical Co. is attempting to
develop a number of new products including a superabsorbent
fiber and a low-calorie fat substitute as part of a plan to
double the size of its business over the next five years.
   Harold A. Sorgenti, president and chief executive officer,
said in an interview the superabsorbent material, called
Fibersorb, has potential application in adult diapers and
surgery table matting, among many other uses. The
nondigestible fat substitute, which was patented recently, is
derived from one of the company's mainstay products,
propylene oxide.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Known as EPG, the fat substitute probably will require
several more years of testing to satisfy requirements of the
Food and Drug Administration. Meanwhile, Mr. Sorgenti said
Arco Chemical is "trying to establish agreements" with a
number of other companies that could lead to EPG's
commercialization and marketing in food products.
   Arco Chemical scientists believe EPG has greater stability
than some other fat substitutes, such as Monsanto Co.'s
Simplesse, which recently won FDA approval for use in such
products as ice cream. "Ours has potential for hot-food
uses," Mr. Sorgenti said. "It can be baked, for instance."
   Arco Chemical's mainstay, propylene oxide, is an
intermediate used in making resins, urethanes, insulation
materials, cushionings and many health and food products.
Among its major derivatives are styrene, used widely in the
rubber and plastics industries; propylene glycol, used in
automotive coolants and aircraft de-icing products; and
tertiary butyl alcohol, used for octane enhancers that
replace lead in gasoline.
   The company's growth strategy is predicated largely on
expanding demand for these derivatives and finding new uses
for them. At the annual meeting of shareholders Wednesday,
Mr. Sorgenti announced plans to invest about $2.5 billion
over the next five years to support that expansion effort.
   More than half of the amount is expected to be spent in
areas outside the U.S. In 1989, foreign sales and exports
contributed 44% of the company's total sales of $2.66
billion. The company has customers in 46 countries.
   The largest family of propylene oxide derivatives is
polyols, which are used in urethane foams and coatings. New
plants in Indonesia and France will boost capacity by about
275 million pounds annually. In addition, the company has
agreed to buy Union Carbide Corp.'s urethane polyols and
propylene glycol businesses.
   As another part of the expansion plan, the company's
production capacity for propylene oxide will increase about
33% to four billion pounds by 1994, Mr. Sorgenti said, aided
by new plants in Texas and Korea.
   Even though the company has strong cash flow, financing
the expansion will require substantial increases in
borrowing. Arco Chemical has about $419 million of long-term
debt, representing about 19% of total capitalization.
   "We think our current capital structure is not optimal,"
said Marvin O. Schlanger, senior vice president and chief
financial officer. "We would like to have debt in the range
of 30% to 40%" of total capital, he said. The company plans
to reach that target gradually over several years.
   Profit margins on the company's styrene monomers, another
core product group, fell sharply in 1989 as world-wide
capacity increased and demand declined. One major factor, Mr.
Sorgenti said, was the steep drop in styrene demand in China
after the brutal political and economic crackdown last
spring. In addition, the automotive, housing and
durable-goods sectors of the U.S. economy softened, and they
are likely to remain sluggish through at least the first half
of 1990.
   "My own personal view is that we have bottomed out and are
coming back up," Mr. Sorgenti said. But he indicated that he
doesn't anticipate any dramatic increases in demand later
this year.
   In 1987, Atlantic Richfield Co. spun off part of Arco
Chemical in a public offering. The giant energy company still
owns more than 80% of the chemical maker's stock. Lodwrick M.
Cook, Atlantic Richfield's chairman and chief executive, is
also Arco Chemical's chairman.
   Mr. Cook missed the chemical maker's annual meeting
Wednesday because he was in Budapest, meeting with several
Hungarian companies that Mr. Sorgenti said "could have
potential for joint ventures" with Arco Chemical. He didn't
identify the companies or disclose the nature of the
prospective ventures.
   Mr. Sorgenti said he thinks his company is "poised to
benefit" from the relaxation of economic controls in Eastern
European, although "we believe it will take some time before
these markets are revitalized and demand increases for
chemical industry products."

   Coastal Corp. Says It's Getting Ready
   For Boom Times in the Energy Industry

   HOUSTON -- Coastal Corp. said that it expects a major
resurgence in the energy industry this decade and that it has
been actively readying itself.
   "Now is the time to prepare for another boom in the energy
business that will occur in the next five years," Chairman
Oscar S. Wyatt Jr. told the annual meeting here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Wyatt said that oil and natural gas markets are
"moving out of a period of surplus and into a period" where
those markets "will be driven by availability of supply." He
added, "We see a cyclical turnaround just getting started."
   In fact, Mr. Wyatt warned that natural-gas shortages could
come shortly, particularly during the winter. Discussing the
short period of frigid weather last winter, he said, "If that
cold snap had lasted 30 days we would have had brownouts and
blackouts all over."
   The energy company said its spending on capital expansion
in 1989 and 1990 will exceed a total of $1 billion. "Spending
will be mainly on facilities to serve new markets and new
business, not for maintenance or replacement," said James R.
Paul, Coastal's chief executive.
   Coastal, which made a number of successful and
unsuccessful takeover attempts in the 1980s, said it now
intends to spend more of its available cash on internally
generated projects.
   "There's going to be less of a tendency for us and
everybody else to make acquisitions" in the current
environment, Mr. Paul said. He added that Coastal perceives
energy company stock prices to be relatively strong and
anti-takeover restrictions to be stricter and more
widespread.
   Mr. Wyatt said he expects Americans to increasingly demand
cleaner fuels, and that "Coastal is well positioned." The
company has emphasized its low-sulfur coal reserves, acquired
an oil refinery in Aruba that will make low-sulfur products
and increased its natural gas assets.
   Mr. Paul said Coastal expects 1990 net income to increase
from last year's $170.1 million, or $1.81 a share. He said he
expects operating profit for the company's gas segment will
be about the same this year, or at about the $423 million
level of 1989, but that those earnings should be "up
significantly" by 1992. The gas surplus of recent years is
about gone, he said, which should bring higher transportation
margins for Coastal's pipeline operations.
   Environmental pressures should boost demand for natural
gas, considered a cleaner-burning fuel, Mr. Paul said.
Coastal plans to double its own natural-gas production in the
next few years from the 400 million cubic feet a day produced
last year, he said. He added that operating profit from
exploration and production will be double the $41 million of
1989 when Coastal reaches its goal.
   Coal earnings will rise this year from 1989's $72 million,
Mr. Paul said. Nearly all 900 million tons of Coastal's
recoverable reserves are classified as low sulfur, he added.

   Top Specialty Retailers Show Strength
   For April, in Part Because of Late Easter

BROADLINE RETAILERS, DEPARTMENT STORES (RTB)
SPECIALTY APPAREL RETAILERS (SAP)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Some of the nation's top specialty retailers
reported strong April sales gains, but comparable-store sales
increases for the combined March and April selling periods
averaged only 5.6%.
   April sales this year were inflated by the addition of
Easter-related revenue. Last year Easter occurred in March.
Still, Gap Inc. showed sales increases of 25% for stores open
at least one year, while Limited Inc. reported
comparable-store gains of 16%. For the 13 weeks ended
Saturday, Gap's comparable-store sales rose 18%, while
Limited showed 11% gains.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Many department stores have undergone financial
restructuring, and they've become much less willing to take
chances on fashion merchandise," said Barry Bryant, analyst
at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "The result is that
stores like Gap and Limited, which are clearly focused, are
doing well."
   Meanwhile, at K mart Corp., comparable-store sales,
including foreign, rose 6.3% for the four weeks ended May 2
and 3% for the 13 weeks ended May 2.
   "Sales were strong in April, aided by the later date for
Easter in 1990 and by favorable weather conditions throughout
much of the East and Midwest," said K mart's chairman and
chief executive officer, Joseph E. Antonini. "Seasonal
merchandise in both hardline {appliances} and apparel
departments sold well during the April period."
   Robert Buchanan, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.,
Baltimore, said the company's performance was in line with
its plan.
   "Markdowns weren't significantly higher than last year,"
said Mr. Buchanan. "If you add March and April, however,
comparable-store sales were up about 2.5%, far behind
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which is up about 9.5% for the two
months. It's safe to say that K mart continues to lose market
share to some of its better-focused competitors."
   Mr. Buchanan noted that K mart's expense ratio -- selling,
general and administrative expenses in relation to sales --
is 23% for its discount stores, compared with only 15% for
Wal-Mart's discount stores and 16% for the Target discount
division of Dayton Hudson Corp. "This makes it tougher for K
mart to price competitively across the board, and still earn
a high return on sales."
   Mr. Buchanan noted that specialty retailers continue to
take market share because of superior execution. "It's
possible some of the big department stores are playing it too
safe," said Mr. Buchanan. "The Limited in particular is
enjoying strong sales. Its Express division was up 28% on a
comparable-store basis in April, and Victoria's Secret was up
41% on a comparable-store basis. Even Lane Bryant rose 18% on
a same-store basis. Overall Limited is aggressive, fully
stocked, and their visual presentation is better than the
competition."
   Business at Dayton Hudson, which recently agreed to
acquire Marshall Field's, continued to be good.
Comparable-store sales rose 5.5% for the four weeks ended
Saturday and 6.8% for the 13 weeks ended Saturday.
   "Given the Easter shift this year, it's meaningful to look
at the results for March and April combined," said Kenneth A.
Macke, chairman and chief executive. "Total sales for the
two-month period were up 13.5%, and comparable-store sales
were up 7%."

   A Unicef-sponsored study in Bangladesh, where
diarrhea-related illnesses kill 300,000 children a year, has
found that complications from even mild malnutrition can kill
children suffering from normally minor diseases.
   Unicef said the study found that hypoglycemia, which is an
abnormally low concentration of sugar in the blood and a
frequent consequence of malnutrition, was an important cause
of death in children with no overt signs of malnutrition.
Twenty-five percent of young diarrhea patients who died had
hypoglycemia, according to the study.
   The hypoglycemic children studied had insufficient extra
body fat and protein to keep normal blood-glucose levels.
"This study illustrated how even mild or moderate degrees of
malnutrition can result in children dying from what might
have been only a minor illness in a better-nourished child,"
said Michael Bennish, who led the team that studied more than
2,000 children over eight months.
   "Deaths {from hypoglycemia} could have been avoided if the
children had been fed during their illness, or if they had
been better nourished before they developed diarrhea," Dr.
Bennish said.
                                                                                                       

   TELEPHONE INVESTIGATION
                                                                                                       

   The European Community Commission began investigating
international telephone agreements to see if there was price
fixing in violation of EC competition rules. An EC official
said the probe was undertaken due to the growing significance
of international communications for the EC economy, the fast
growth in telecommunications as well as their rapid
technological development and rising costs. The official said
the commission was examining whether international phone
charges were being set by a few major telephone companies and
imposed on all members of the 160-nation International
Consultative Committee on Telegraph and Telephone.
                                                                                                       

   TRAINING SOVIET MANAGERS
                                                                                                       

   Finnish companies will train up to 400 Soviet business
managers a year, Finland's Trade and Industry Minister Ilkka
Suominen announced. The program, to get under way later this
year, will concentrate on areas in which Finland has special
know-how in order "to further promote bilateral trade"
between Finland and the Soviet Union.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD PLAN
                                                                                                       

   South Africa's state-aided Council for Mineral Technology
said the country should sell more of its gold as jewelry. The
council said South Africa had stifled jewelry production with
excessive regulations and taxes, ostensibly to earn
muchneeded foreign exchange as quickly as possible through
bullion exports, and had thus ignored the potential 25% added
value to be gained from selling gold as jewelry. South Africa
recently announced tax concessions and eased regulations to
encourage just such a shift.
                                                                                                       

   TOYOTA ISSUES A DENIAL
                                                                                                       

   Toyota Motor Corp. denied it tried to prevent T. Boone
Pickens from placing ads in Japanese newspapers in his battle
to assert ownership rights in Koito Manufacturing Co., the
Japanese auto-parts maker that is closely linked to Toyota.
Mr. Pickens, whose 26% stake in Koito makes him the company's
largest single investor, said Toyota tried to block him from
publishing the ads -- which mention Toyota -- in Japan's
major newspapers. The ads, which haven't yet run in Japan,
say that collusive business practices force higher prices on
consumers. Several Tokyo newspapers said they had held up the
ads and were considering publishing a version that omits
Toyota's name.
                                                                                                       

   GERMAN BANK SCANDAL
                                                                                                       

   Three bond traders at West Germany's Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank, the nation's fourth-largest bank, were
arrested Wednesday on allegations that they personally
profited from bond-trading transactions. The arrests were
made at the bank. The three traders were in the bank's
domestic bond-trading department, which includes trading of
West German government bonds.
                                                                                                       

   NICARAGUAN EXPORTS
                                                                                                       

   Nicaragua has resumed exports to the U.S. now that a 1985
trade embargo has been lifted.
   The Latin American nation shipped 18,000 metric tons of
sugar on Tuesday from the port of Corinto, part of the 54,328
metric tons Nicaragua can sell to the U.S. this year at a
preferred price above the world market. Former U.S. President
Ronald Reagan imposed the embargo as a measure against the
Marxist Sandinista government. President George Bush lifted
it after Violetta Chamorro de Barrios won the presidency in
February.
   The U.S. had been the biggest buyer of Nicaraguan goods
until the embargo began. During the embargo, Nicaragua sold
most of its sugar to Soviet-bloc nations.
   The U.S. embassy in Nicaragua said the Bush administration
is considering "steps to reduce barriers and tariffs and open
the market to Nicaraguan exports."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Bowing to U.S. threats to withdraw vital funding, the
World Health Organization shelved indefinitely a fresh
application by the Palestine Liberation Organization to join

U.S. restrictions on granting visas to those with the
disease.

   KIRKLAND, Wash. -- A huge gain on the sale of its
southeast cellular systems boosted McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc.'s first-quarter net income to $851.9
million, or $4.97 a share.
   That compares with a year-ago net loss of $97.7 million,
or 74 cents a share. Revenue increased 76% to $180 million
from $102 million in last year's first quarter.

   McCaw sold its southeast cellular systems to Contel
Cellular Inc. for a gain of about $1.16 billion. Results of
the most recent quarter also reflect completion of its tender
offer for LIN Broadcasting Corp., as well as an extraordinary
tax benefit of $157.8 million.
   Prior to the one-time gain on the asset sale, McCaw had a
loss for the period, including interest expense, of $96.6
million. A year ago, the comparable operating loss, plus
interest expenditures, totaled $102.5 million.
   McCaw also reported strong first-quarter rises in both
cash flow and customers. Cash flow rose sharply in the first
quarter to $31.4 million, compared with $4.3 million in last
year's first quarter. The number of cellular subscribers in
McCaw's markets increased 64% to 853,000 from 520,000 a year
ago. According to analysts, McCaw will need sustained sharp
growth over the next five years to pay off a huge debt burden
assumed in the acquisition of a controlling interest in LIN
Broadcasting.

   SEATTLE, Wash. -- Immunex Corp. scientists shed new light
on the role of the immune system in the rejection of
transplanted organs.
   The company said mouse studies indicate that a molecular
sponge for the protein interleukin-1 (IL-1) can inhibit
rejection of heart transplants without harmful side effects,
such as kidney damage and blocked arteries, that can result
from currently approved immunosuppressive drugs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agent is a soluble form of the IL-1 receptor, the cell
surface protein to which IL-1 attaches itself, thus signaling
the immune system to martial cells to attack a foreign
invader, such as a transplanted organ. Sometimes when the
immune response goes awry, those same immune system signals
attack the host's own tissues, as in auto-immune disease.
   The soluble IL-1 receptor works by sopping up the body's
IL-1 before it has a chance to trigger an unwanted immune
reaction. It is one of five such receptor-based products now
under development by the company's Receptech unit.
   Immunex said it plans to launch human clinical trials of
the IL-1 receptor in 1991, with an eye toward developing the
agent as a treatment for transplant rejection,
graft-versus-host disease, and auto-immune diseases such as
arthritis.
   The research, reported in the current issue of the journal
Science, said survival of heart grafts in mice was prolonged
to 17 days in treated mice, from 12 days in untreated control
animals.

   East Germans Seek More Concessions
   That Could Lift Bonn's Cost for Union

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- As desperate East German
officials portrayed a rapidly deteriorating economy, 100,000
East Germans protested for more concessions that could
significantly swell Bonn's outlays for monetary union,
already estimated to reach 60 billion marks ($36.8 billion)
annually.
   East German Premier Lothar de Maiziere told East Berlin's
parliament yesterday that East Germany's budget deficit is
likely to reach a staggering 120 billion West German marks by
the end of this year because of rising welfare costs and
business bankruptcies. At least 1.5 million of East Germany's
8.5 million workers will have to be retrained or face
unemployment by the end of 1991, according to his report.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Guenther Krause, a parliamentary state secretary and a
senior East German negotiator in the monetary union talks,
candidly told parliament that "we slowly have to begin
thinking about who will pay for these 120 billion."
   The apparent appeal to Bonn comes as members in the
German-German monetary commission, having agreed on a 1-to-1
mark conversion rate for East German savings and wages, are
at loggerheads over support for East Germany's crumbling
welfare system. The West German mark is scheduled to replace
the East German mark beginning July 2.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, before the Bonn parliament
yesterday, conceded that East Germany's budget and other
major problems still defied solution, but he said the July 2
date for monetary union remained intact.
   In East Berlin, the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
renamed Communist Party, accused Mr. de Maiziere's democratic
government of bowing to Bonn's terms for monetary union by
not demanding a better financial cushion for East German
workers and pensioners. While wages and pensions will be
changed into West German marks at a 1-to-1 rate, East German
wages and pensions are only a third of West German levels,
raising fears of impoverishment when a common German market
arrives.
   East Germans also could face a doubling in their rents,
which are heavily subsidized by the state. The uncertainty
boiled over yesterday as workers vented anger over possible
job and housing losses, and farmers blocked major highways to
back demands for continued price subsidies. Most East German
farmers also demand protection from West German competitors,
whom they fear will pour in with well-oiled distribution
systems once the border is opened to unrestricted trade in
July.
   Industrial workers downed their tools yesterday in warning
strikes to protest subsidy cutbacks planned as East Germany
shifts from central planning to a free market. Joined in
their strike by East German teachers, the workers fear that
their jobs at archaic plants face extinction in open
competition with the West.
   Citing the government study, Mr. Krause, the state
secretary, said only a third of East Germany's industrial
enterprises are expected to be able to compete after monetary
and economic union. More than half are already operating at a
loss, but they could be salvaged with subsidies. The
remaining 14% face imminent bankruptcy, the report said.
   East German enterprises have a combined debt to the state
of about 260 billion East German marks. Monetary union
negotiators are still wrangling over how -- and by whom --
the sum is to be settled after July, when impoverished East
German enterprises will have to service their debt in hard
West German marks.

   New York City -- the bulk of $900 million of general
obligation revenue anticipation notes, Fiscal 1990 Series C
and D, due June 29, 1990, apparently was won by a Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets group. Merrill Lynch purchased $400
million in notes at yields ranging from 6.247% to 6.419%. The
notes were priced as follows: $100 million of notes priced to
yield 6.247%, $50 million of notes priced to yield 6.288%,
$100 million of notes priced to yield 6.337%, $100 million of
notes priced to yield 6.386% and $50 million of notes priced
to yield 6.419%. The notes, rated MIG-2 by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and SP-1 by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., were priced
at the initial reoffering to yield 6.40%, according to an
official with the lead underwriter. The notes are being sold
to help the city meet its financial obligations until it
receives funds from the state. The state funds are
unavailable until a state budget is passed. All together,
seven firms purchased the $900 million in notes, according to
city officials.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. -- $153 million of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Mortgage Trust real estate mortgage investment
conduit securities is being offered in eight classes. Full
pricing details weren't immediately available. The offering,
Trust 1, is backed by 15-year and 30-year mortgages with a
weighted average coupon rate of 10.97%. The mortgages are
"non-conforming," which means they aren't eligible for
purchase by the Federal National Mortgage Association or
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Most of the mortgages are
too large to be purchased by either agency. The issue is
rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp. based on the quality of the underlying loans,
which are mostly from California, and an insurance policy
covering 10% of the deal from General Electric Mortgage
Insurance Co.

company also said the debentures are redeemable at the option
of the company at any time after the expiration of 30 days
following the date on which the temporary global debenture is
exchanged for definitive debentures, at prices declining from
106%, if called prior to May 18, 1991, to 100% on or after
May 18, 1996. The debentures aren't redeemable prior to May
18, 1993, unless the closing price of the common stock for a
specified period is at least 200% of the conversion price
then in effect. Proceeds will be used to finance acquisitions
of cellular telephone properties.
   Canton of Bern (Switzerland) -- 51 million Swiss francs of
bonds due June 1, 2000, with equity-purchase warrants, fixed
5 3/4% coupon at par, via Citicorp Investment Bank

   Ogilvy Snags Eastern Airline's Account

   Eastern Airlines abruptly pulled its $45 million
advertising account from Lintas, awarding it -- without the
usual step of putting the account up for review -- to Ogilvy
&amp; Mather.
   The shift of the huge account came as a surprise to the ad
industry. Typically, an account move of that size takes
months, and follows a detailed review process in which a
number of agencies are invited to compete for the business.
But Texas Air's Eastern unit, under its new bankruptcy
trustee Martin Shugrue, "wanted to make a new beginning," he
said in a statement. Mr. Shugrue has already switched other
suppliers, including lawyers and financial advisers, in a bid
to make a clean sweep and distance himself from Texas Air.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The loss is a cruel one for Interpublic Group unit Lintas,
which had just given a new advertising presentation to Mr.
Shugrue a week ago. "We're just furious, but there's nothing
we can do about it," said Spencer Plavoukos, chairman and
chief executive officer of Lintas's New York office, which
handled the account. "What makes it so frustrating is we know
the people {at Eastern} are behind us. This is a one-man
decision. He answers to nobody but the {bankruptcy-court}
judge."
   For WPP Group's Ogilvy, however, the account is even more
significant than an ordinary big account win. Ogilvy's New
York office, which will handle the account, hadn't won a
major new piece of business for more than two years. Losses
have mounted, including the Seagram wine cooler business
earlier this year. Morale has been poor and new business
efforts have been fruitless. The endless march of problems
led to the departure last month of Michael Lesser, who had
headed the office.
   "The drought is over," said Graham Phillips, Ogilvy's
chairman and chief executive officer. "It's going to start
pouring again."
   Ogilvy's win shows just how important contacts and
personal friendships can be in the ad business. The agency
snared the business after hiring several former associates of
Mr. Shugrue. Last weekend it gave Mr. Shugrue a presentation
in which it talked about its credentials and offered some
rough ideas about creative concepts. No other agencies were
invited to pitch to Eastern, nor were others even aware that
Eastern wanted to switch agencies.
   Mr. Shugrue was familiar with Ogilvy, though, through a
number of personal ties. He knows William Gray, an Ogilvy
senior vice president who had worked on an airline account
before. Ogilvy also recently hired two of Mr. Shugrue's
former associates. It brought in George Zuckerman, who had
once worked at Ayer, which had handled the account for
Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air. Mr. Shugrue is a
former president of Continental. And Ogilvy hired as a
consultant James O'Donnell, a former Continental marketing
executive who had worked closely with Mr. Shugrue.
   Ogilvy's Mr. Phillips agreed that "we know Marty from
previous lives. He knew some of our people and knew of us."
But he said that Ogilvy won the account because of its "very
good track record and a terrific direct response outfit." He
said Eastern didn't bother with a formal agency review
"because obviously they're in a big hurry. They have a lot to
do in a short period of time. In {Mr. Shugrue's} situation,
you have to move quickly."
   For Lintas, the loss is something of a double hit. In
March, it looked as if Lintas might have a shot of handling
both the Eastern and the Continental accounts, an
unprecedented coup for an ad agency. At the time,
Continental's ad account was up for review, and Lintas was
believed to be a frontrunner. But the agency ultimately lost
out to Wells, Rich, Greene. Now, Lintas is out in the cold,
without any airline account at all.
   Eastern's most recent advertising varied from region to
region, with most talking about special prices. But the ads
all revolved around the theme, "We're building a better
airline." Lintas's Mr. Plavoukos said it was "too early to
assess" possible layoffs, but said that Lintas is involved in
some new business pitches, and "I don't anticipate there will
be very many people let go. What I'm shooting for is zero."

   Burger King Gets Newman
                                                                                                       

   Burger King signed actor Paul Newman to appear in a new TV
ad campaign.
   But there's a twist: Mr. Newman will appear in the ads in
clips from a number of films in which he has starred. Mr.
Newman wouldn't agree to appear on camera in the spots, which
tout the arrival of the actor's salad dressings in Burger
King restaurants.
   Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC, wouldn't
say which of Mr. Newman's films, which include "The Color of
Money," "The Sting" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"
have been excerpted for the commercials.
   "We are thrilled to be associated with Paul Newman," a
spokeswoman said. The ads, which will begin airing later this
month, were created by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, a unit
of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.
   Terms of the pact weren't disclosed. The actor has donated
all of the proceeds from the sale of his salad dressing to
charities, and sales of the product at Burger King will also
be donated, the spokeswoman said.
   The Burger King ad contract marks the second major
advertising deal this year for Mr. Newman, a star whom many
industry observers once believed would never appear in
commercials. His first commercial in the U.S., which aired in
January, was for American Express.

   EATING OUT: McDonald's tonight will begin airing
commercials with a new theme, "Food, folks and fun," to
replace its "Good time, great taste" slogan. The theme will
appear on all of McDonald's new ads, including four spots
promoting its breakfast menu that star singer Patti LaBelle.

   Low-Lifes and High-Fliers in La-La Land

   "Sweet La-La Land" (Poseidon Press, 270 pages, $18.95) is
the third and most satisfying yet of Robert Campbell's
"La-La" novels, all of which feature a shopworn private eye
named Whistler. A former local television performer and
recovering alcoholic, Whistler keeps office hours at a coffee
shop near Hollywood and Vine, where he can watch "the herd of
users, losers and the lost" parading along the hookers'
promenade.
   At the start of this entry, Whistler spots an old flame
named Faye on that tawdry avenue. Fifteen years ago, Faye
left Whistler for Daniel "Inch" Younger, a strange-eyed
Appalachian later convicted of a series of grisly Los Angeles
murders. When Younger was imprisoned, Faye moved out of
state. Eventually she left her and Younger's four-year-old
son with Younger's Kentucky kin, who sold him. Faye took off
on a drunken solo odyssey. Sober now and back in Hollywood,
Faye is running a shelter for runaways, rescuing children
from the seedy streets. Whistler, dreaming of a new life with
Faye, offers to find her child, the boy she abandoned 11
years ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unbeknownst to Faye and Whistler, the seething Younger is
about to be paroled. Also unbeknownst to all, Faye and
Younger's son has made his way to La-La Land and joined the
army of youngsters hawking their bodies along the sleazy
boulevards.
   Coincidence looms nearly large enough in "Sweet La-La
Land" to be a major character, but such is the spell cast by
Mr. Campbell's tough-poetic prose that any
"Hey-wait-a-minute" readers' objections are postponed until
after the book is done. Meanwhile, the plot is propelled by a
number of chance encounters and missed opportunities.
   Whistler's point of view is only one of many through which
the narrative unfolds. Among the low-lifes and high-fliers
encountered are Paul Hobby, a scummy B-movie mogul who once
employed Younger and who may have something to fear from his
release; Eve Choyren, "the most notorious thrill merchant in
town," who titillates her johns and janes with diabolic
rites; and Pig-Nose Dopoley, a Hollywood hanger-on and
possible contract killer. Among Whistler's recurring retinue
are Bosco Silverlake, the one-armed coffee shop
counterman-philosopher; and Isaac Canaan, the juvenile-vice
cop who's kept his compassion because or in spite of having
seen too much depravity.
   Another writer working some of the same Southern
California turf is Timothy Hallinan, whose "Everything But
the Squeal" (New American Library, 341 pages, $17.95) is the
second suspense novel to feature Los Angeles private
investigator Simeon Grist. This outing begins with Grist
haunting the all-night Hollywood food stands favored by
kiddie whores and their pimps, in search of a runaway teen
from Kansas named Aimee.
   Mr. Hallinan's book, more orthodox than Mr. Campbell's, is
narrated in traditional wisecracking private eye first
person. The dialogue is snappy, the pace is brisk, and there
are nice descriptions. Here Grist contrasts the clientele at
two diner dives: "The drugs of choice in Tommy's are downers,
mainly codeine and other painkillers, but at Jack's nobody
screws around with anything you don't enjoy at the sharp
point of a needle. . . . The other difference is that the
boys and girls at Tommy's sometimes say no. . . . At Jack's,
`Just say no' is a punch line."
   The most memorable youngsters encountered in this book are
not street kids but children of privilege: Aurora, the older
sister of the runaway Grist is hunting; Jessica, Grist's
smart-mouthed goddaughter; and Morris, an awkward computer
whiz. These three come very close to stealing the show.
   Grist holds his own, though, as he uncovers the sordid
details of a child prostitution and pornography ring that
uses a talent agency as its front. "Squeal" combines
high-octane action, baroque violence, humor and pathos in a
self-assured manner that marks Mr. Hallinan as a capable new
practitioner of the private eye tale.
   Henry Rios, the homosexual Hispanic lawyer featured in the
suspense novels of Michael Nava, also encounters pedophilia
and kiddie porn in his latest case. Rios is based in Los
Angeles, but in "How Town" (Harper &amp; Row, 244 pages, $16.95)
the attorney returns to Los Robles, the Northern California
city where he was raised, to defend a fellow native son
charged with murdering a pornography merchant. Paul Windsor,
the accused, has a history of molesting underage females.
There are those in Los Robles (including Windsor) who think a
homosexual lawyer should have a special affinity with a
heterosexual child molester, but Rios is quick to set them
straight, as it were.
   There isn't all that much detection in "How Town." The
puzzle pieces fall into place without too much fuss, but
there are some good courtroom scenes. Mr. Nava's lively
accounts of legal maneuvering have an authoritative ring. And
this book like those discussed above, achieves added
resonance through showing the ways (not all of them criminal
in the judicial sense) that children are often turned into
victims by the elders who are supposed to protect them.

   West German Firms
   Go Slow on Ventures
   With East Germans

   HANOVER, West Germany -- West German companies have put
most business ventures with East Germany on ice until the
start of monetary union July 2, executives at major West
German industrial groups say.
   After a flurry of preliminary agreements on joint ventures
and investment projects earlier in the year, the companies
are waiting for clear financial information from potential
East German partners and details on the government's economic
program before pushing their plans any further.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The period between the announcement of a monetary union
and its implementation is a difficult time," said Heinz
Schimmelbusch, chairman of Metallgesellschaft AG, a
diversified metals concern that is particularly active in
Eastern Europe. "At the moment, there is almost nothing we
can do."
   The reluctance of West German companies to make any firm
investment commitment in East Germany could brake the arrival
of the economic boom that many economists and politicians
have predicted. But companies say that once the mark has
become the official currency and legal and economic
conditions are right, they are planning to move quickly to
transfer the needed capital to East Germany.
   Managers list a series of uncertainties that stop them
from acting before July 2, ranging from the treatment of East
German corporate debt to energy prices, wages and business
regulations. Most difficult is the absence of clear laws
governing corporate ownership, they say.
   In the coming weeks, the East German government is
planning to pass a series of laws that should create a
similar business environment as that found in West Germany,
but companies say they aren't willing to commit funds on
promises alone.
   "The necessary legal basis just doesn't exist yet," said
Friedrich Schunder, a senior official at engineering concern
Mannesmann AG. "We don't know whether we can hold the
majority in a company, we can't buy any real estate, we can't
hire East Germans freely, and there is no protection for
investments."
   Because of these constraints, "we can't adopt any measure
that affects the wealth of the concern," Mr. Schunder added.

   Banks Take to the Road
   In Search of Customers

   MOBILE BANKS are rolling onto the scene, one of the latest
bids to find untapped customers who might want to open
accounts.
   First National Bank of Jackson, Tenn., for instance, plans
to take its new mobile branch -- a converted armored car --
into "areas often ignored by banks, including nursing homes,
factory sites and public housing projects," says Chairman
Ernest Vickers III. That was enough to win government
approval, not to mention the endorsement of the local chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   The brightly painted truck, which has regular daily hours,
will initially cash checks, set up savings plans and sell
certificates of deposit. Eventually, customers will be able
to apply for loans and mortgages.
   First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Raleigh, N.C., is
taking a similar route. It now features a mobile automatic
teller machine, embedded in the side of a van. Although it
won't accept deposits or loan payments, the unit will travel
to fairs and other big gatherings to dispense cash to
customers who are ATM clients.
   Bankers say the cost of setting up and operating a mobile
branch is roughly one-tenth of what it costs to build and
operate the smallest brick-and-mortar office.
   They also want to stress service. Mr. Vickers of First
National, in Tennesee, says: "We figured if Federal Express
and United Parcel Service are going to folks' front doors to
pick up packages, why should bankers demand" that customers
come to them?
                                                                                                       

   A State Hopes Pride
   And Cash Have Affinity
                                                                                                       

   WHAT'S GOOD for Elvis fans might be good for Rhode Island.
   Faced with a $100 million shortfall in this year's $1.5
billion budget, Rhode Island's Legislature passed two
separate bills authorizing the state's general treasurer to
negotiate with banks and thrifts to establish a Rhode Island
credit card. The state would garner a percentage of a fee
every time a holder uses the card.
   In recent years, the credit-card market has been saturated
by such "affinity cards" -- available for everyone from Elvis
Presley lovers to sports fans.
   State Senator David H. Sholes says a card emblazoned with
Rhode Island's seal or a picture of the state's pristine
seashore could generate as much as $3 million for state
coffers in the first year. Of course, that means some 60,000
of the roughly 850,000 credit cards held by Rhode Island
residents must make the switch.
   "That's counting on a lot of state pride," says David
Watson, vice president of marketing for Cardholder Management
Services Inc., a credit-card consulting company. "It's
difficult to translate that kind of intangible good feeling
into switching credit cards. You've got to offer something
more concrete, like discounts."
   Indeed, a similar state-sponsored affinity card program
was approved in Montana last year, but has gone nowhere for
lack of interest.
                                                                                                       

   Will Depositors Flood In
   For More Liquid CDs?
                                                                                                       

   SEVERAL BANKS and thrifts are easing restrictions on
certificates of deposit, trying to make them more liquid in
an attempt to attract investors.
   Some investors shy away from CDs because there can be
stiff penalties for early withdrawals -- often the loss of
both interest and a portion of the principal. Young families,
in particular, "have so many big-ticket expenses that can pop
up on them," says Paul Jennings, senior vice president of DF
Southeastern Inc., a Decatur, Ga., savings and loan. "They
want the higher CD rate, but are afraid to tie up the money."
   DF Southeastern's new Wait-and-CD, which earns 7.75%, acts
as a temporary parking space, says Mr. Jennings. The customer
has the option, during the six-month maturity, of switching
to a higher-rate CD or withdrawing the funds altogether --
with no penalty. "This is a less-imposing way for younger
customers to get their feet wet," he says.
   In some cases, the penalties haven't been eliminated, just
softened. The Access CD, introduced last month by First of
America Bank Corp. in Kalamazoo, Mich., gives customers
access to their accounts without penalty. But to get what
amounts to an 8% annual rate on their CDs, customers must
keep a minimum of $1,000 deposited throughout the two-year
term -- otherwise, they will get just 6%.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   IMAGINE NEVER having to make a last-minute dash for cash
before a movie. The American Multi-Cinema Theaters Inc. chain
and Los Angeles-based First Interstate Corp. are testing an
automated box office to dispense tickets, as well as $20
vouchers for popcorn and other refreshments. Customers would
simply use their automatic teller cards. . . . Synergistics
Research Corp. in Atlanta is conducting a study to figure out
why there is a resurgence in telephone banking. Such services
were popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but fizzled
when banks began offering services through personal
computers. Now, the pendulum is swinging back. . . .
Sweepstakes are often a no-win proposition for banks. People
invariably wander in seeking a chance at an island vacation
without ever inquiring about bank services. So First Bank
System Inc. of Minneapolis is adding a twist: All players win
discounts on various bank products, as well chances at other
prizes such as a camera or 1990 Jeep Cherokee.

   AT&amp;T's Computer Business Is Planning
   To Build Sales Partnerships in Europe

   LONDON -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., struggling
to expand abroad, aims to form a chain of computer-sales
partnerships around Western Europe over the next year or two,
a top AT&amp;T executive said.
   Robert M. Kavner, head of AT&amp;T's world-wide computer
business, said the company is talking with a number of
European companies about possible mergers, joint ventures or
other forms of alliance. He didn't name prospective partners,
but said they include medium-sized computer software and
"systems integration" companies in France, West Germany,
Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. A systems integrator
tailors big computer systems to fit individual customers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We plan to go country-by-country" around Western Europe,
forming national partnerships to build a distribution network
for AT&amp;T computers, Mr. Kavner said in an interview here.
   AT&amp;T's previous strategy was more multinational: It tried
to expand in Europe through a tempestuous partnership with
Italian-based Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co., acting as AT&amp;T's
computer distributor throughout Europe. That alliance was
scaled back in 1988, with each side blaming the other for
disappointing results. As a result, Europe now provides just
5% of AT&amp;T's world-wide computer revenue of $2 billion a
year.
   As the first public step in its new country-by-country
strategy, AT&amp;T unveiled plans Thursday to try boosting
computer sales in Britain and Ireland. AT&amp;T Istel Ltd., a
British-based computer company that AT&amp;T bought last year for
#180 million ($302.3 million), launched a new subsidiary to
sell AT&amp;T's full range of U.S.-designed computer products in
Britain and Ireland. Currently, AT&amp;T is a miniscule player in
the British market, selling computers partly through
Olivetti's U.K. unit. The Olivetti link will continue, but is
expected to diminish in importance to AT&amp;T as Istel grows.
   At a news conference here and in a subsequent interview,
Mr. Kavner appeared at pains to reassure skittish clients and
partners about AT&amp;T's commitment to Europe. In the wake of
AT&amp;T's failure with Olivetti, European industry gossips have
been buzzing with speculation about how or whether AT&amp;T can
expand its computer business in Europe. "This isn't a shot in
the dark," Mr. Kavner said of the Istel venture. "AT&amp;T is
here for the long term."
   Expanded European sales, Mr. Kavner added, are an
important part of his overall goal to get at least half of
the company's computer revenue outside the U.S. by 2000.
Currently, 90% of AT&amp;T computer revenue come from its home,
U.S. market. He said he is also pushing to boost sales in
Asia, through local partnerships there.
   Industry analysts remain skeptical about AT&amp;T's prospects
in Europe, however. Compared to when it began its Olivetti
alliance, AT&amp;T will benefit from a much broader range of
computer products and from growing market demand for AT&amp;T's
strongest suit: products that run on the Unix software
system, an industry standard invented by AT&amp;T. But the new,
country-by-country approach may take too long and consume too
much management time, analysts said.
   "When you start looking at alliances with everybody and
his dog, you've got to worry about each individual operation
working out well -- which complicates matters," said analyst
Susan Anthony, of London-based Robert Fleming Securities Ltd.
She added that AT&amp;T doesn't "have the best track record in
the world {on alliances} after their fling with Olivetti."
   But Mr. Kavner said there were "a lot of lessons learned
with Olivetti" -- including the need to avoid cultural
misunderstandings between partners from different countries.
And his country-by-country strategy was apparently forced by
circumstances. The opportunities for pan-European
partnerships are few, he indicated. He said AT&amp;T approached
some multinational systems-integration companies in Europe
about alliances, but none were interested. And he indicated
AT&amp;T isn't eager for another Olivetti-style alliance with a
big European computer maker. Such a company would already
have its own range of products to sell, conflicting with
AT&amp;T's range.
   "We have computers. What we don't have in Europe is
distribution," Mr. Kavner said.
   AT&amp;T executives point to its Istel venture in Britain as
one possible model for how its European business will grow.
Istel, the former computer division of British auto maker
Rover Group Ltd., is a relatively small systems integrator,
but one with a good reputation and such blue-chip British
clients as Rover and retailer Dixons Group PLC. Since AT&amp;T's
acquisition last year, Istel officials say, the U.S. company
has been lavish with the time and money needed to expand
Istel into a major U.K. market force.
   Mr. Kavner said he expects Istel's revenue within five
years to grow to "several hundred millions of pounds"
annually. In 1989, Istel revenue totaled #108 million.

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
tightened its rules for awarding broadcast licenses,
discarding some of the free-market ideas of the Reagan years
and throwing into doubt a request by Tele-Communications Inc.
for FCC approval of a new satellite service.
   On a 5-0 vote, the agency threw out a Reagan-era proposal
to award broadcast licenses by lottery rather than the
traditional method of conducting hearings to choose the best
applicant. It also voted unanimously to broaden the range of
misconduct that could disqualify applicants from winning
broadcast licenses to include any felony conviction, rather
than just those involving fraud, and antitrust violations
involving mass-media properties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tele-Communications, which lost an antitrust lawsuit in
1985 to a competitor for a cable television franchise in
Missouri, could be hurt by the ruling. The Denver cable
company currently is asking the FCC to approve a plan to
construct and operate a satellite service that would beam
video programming directly to roof-mounted satellite
receivers. An FCC official said the new policy will be a
factor in the decision to grant Tele-Communications a
license, but said the agency hadn't decided how it will rule.
   Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access
Project, which is challenging the Tele-Communications
application, said the FCC ruling would strengthen his case.
But the agency generally goes out of its way to approve new
services, even if it sometimes bends its policies to
accommodate them. Tele-Communications didn't return calls
seeking comment.
   Tele-Communications is part of a satellite-broadcast
partnership called K Prime Partners, which plans to offer a
10-channel service by the end of this year. Another group,
called Sky Cable, plans a more elaborate service in 1993.
   Separately, the FCC voted unanimously for a series of
proposals to tighten the rules for awarding new broadcast
stations. The agency proposed to ban the practice by which
competitors for a new broadcast property buy each other out
for large sums before going to a hearing.
   The Reagan-era policy was meant to quicken the pace by
which new licenses were awarded, but sometimes degenerated
into a free-for-all in which applications were filed simply
to make money during these negotiations. The FCC proposal
would limit the amount of such payoffs to the expenses
incurred in making an application.
   The FCC also said it hoped to reduce the time it took to
approve a new license to one year from a current average of
three. "Arms-control treaties take less time than the work of
this commission," said FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes.
   But none of the day's proposals addressed the longstanding
criticism of the FCC that it awards broadcast licenses based
on trivial differences among applicants. Frustrations over
the picayune nature of these inquiries have led to
suggestions over the years that the government auction off
new broadcast licenses to the highest bidder rather than give
them away to those chosen during hearings. But broadcasters
have resolutely opposed proposals that they pay for broadcast
frequencies they use.

   NEW YORK -- The navigator is ready to embark, his vessel a
shopping cart. Peril is everywhere. To port lie reefs of
cholesterol; to starboard, shoals of saturated fat; ahead and
behind, outcrops of sodium. And all around he hears, luring
him toward shipwreck, the siren song of advertisers' claims.
   His mission: get through all this and emerge from
Waldbaum's all-night supermarket, here in Queens, with a load
of groceries that won't foul up his heart.

   This proves almost as tough a sail as Odysseus had in
getting home from Troy. But Odysseus had no charts. Our
navigator does -- a sheaf of reports and studies from
scientists who have spent many years ferreting out the links
between fats in the diet, cholesterol in the blood, and
coronary heart disease, or atherosclerosis, the clogging of
the coronary arteries by fatty deposits that leads to heart
attacks.
   Plunging down aisle No. 1, the navigator immediately spots
a major hazard and briskly steers around it. Eggs. This is an
easy passage. By now most people know that egg yolks are
loaded with cholesterol and that too much cholesterol is bad.
But how much is too much, and for whom?
   Actually, cholesterol is necessary for life, and everybody
has a base level of it, manufactured by the liver, in his
bloodstream. This level is genetically determined, and there
isn't much that can be done to change it. On top of that,
however, everybody who eats animal products (plants have no
cholesterol) has an extra amount of it in the blood
attributable to that diet. This cholesterol can be lowered by
eating properly.
   About 10% of the people don't have to worry much. They
have a genetically set base level of cholesterol so low, or
their processing is so efficient, that they can eat pretty
much anything they want without clogging up their arteries.
Another 10% are unlucky. They have such high inborn levels
that they probably will develop coronary-artery disease no
matter how they restrict their diets.
   The rest of the population may be warier about eggs than
it once was, but people still consume far too much dietary
cholesterol -- an average of 450 milligrams a day, according
to research by the American Heart Association and the
American Dietetic Association. None of it is needed.
   "It is useful to remember that there is no known
biochemical reason for humans to ingest cholesterol at all,"
writes W. Virgil Brown, professor of medicine at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York. Vegetarians, he notes, eat
less than 10 milligrams of cholesterol a day and remain
healthy.
   Failing to discern any mass movement toward vegetarianism,
the heart association recommends a daily intake of no more
than 300 milligrams a day for most people. For those who want
to be absolutely heart-healthy or who are at or near high
blood cholesterol levels, 100 milligrams daily is the ration.
   That's 700 a week. The navigator consults his charts. They
say that one single, solitary egg yolk has 274 milligrams of
cholesterol. Sure, he can have an omelet -- if he is willing
to eat nothing else but plants all week. He is not willing.
Eggless, he sails on.
   Stopping near another part of Dairy Reef, he employs a
rule of thumb for such food: If it's solid at room
temperature, it's loaded with saturated fat and therefore
undesirable. More about fat later. It's enough to say now
that saturated fat is the worst kind for the innards and that
Americans eat way too much fat of all kinds -- representing
an average of 36% of the calories they consume.
   The heart association would like that cut to 30% or below.
Way below, others insist; the Pritikin diet, one of the most
severe, limits fat to 10% of calories. To our 59-year-old
shopper, whose belt has unaccountably been let out by two
notches over the past few years, all this means steering away
from butter, the "hard" margarines, and almost all cheeses.
   He reads the fine print. Dorman's LoCal Swiss cheese looks
good (the label says "80% less cholesterol" without saying
what it is 80% less than), but it still has some cholesterol
plus seven grams of fat. This is not high, but the navigator
knows that each thin slice will eat into the safety margin
he'll need in traversing the meat counter. He gets low-fat
cottage cheese instead, along with a quart of skim milk and a
"soft" margarine that has only one gram of saturated fat per
spoonful.
   He turns into aisle No. 2 -- and into a blinding fog of
health hype. Here is a sector that's eight cart-lengths long
and seven shelves high, crammed with hundreds of bottles of
salad dressing and cooking oils singing their own praises at
the expense of others -- "94% saturated fat free," "lower in
saturated fat than Mazola, Wesson or Crisco," "lowest in
saturated fat," and on and on.
   The navigator stops at Mazola, which recently had an ad in
American Health magazine. In the ad, a middle-aged jogger in
a sweatsuit is saying, "Great news] Mazola has now been
tested and approved by the American Heart Association Heart
Guide program. Even better news] A diet with Mazola brought
down my cholesterol."
   At first blush, impressive. But, for one thing, the heart
association, under pressure from the federal government, has
scrapped the Heart Guide program. (Even before that, Mazola
had pulled out of the program.) And inspection of the
evidence shows that the "even better news" is 17 years old
and that a lot more than the use of Mazola was behind the
lowering of cholesterol.
   The ad is based on an experiment in the early '70s by
physiologist Ancel Keys of the University of Minnesota, a
pioneer in linking diet to blood cholesterol and heart
disease. He put three dozen male college students on various
diets and measured the change in their cholesterol. A dozen
of them lowered it by an average of 17% over three weeks on
one 3,000-calorie diet (more than a non-athletic middle-aged
male should eat). That diet replaced butter and shortening
with corn oil like Mazola -- but it also involved substitutes
for meat, eggs and whole milk, changes that appear to have
been considerably more important.
   The lesson for the navigator? "Caveat emptor." And read
the fine print.
   He passes up aisle 2 for the moment and moves into the
calmer waters of the produce department. Here he can load up
unworried by fat, cholesterol or sodium. Amid the fuss and
feathers over the first two, sodium sometimes gets forgotten,
but it is an important contributor to hypertension and
congestive heart failure. Sodium encourages the retention of
water and thus increases blood volume and pressure. High
pressure can cause arterial blowouts -- stroke and aneurysm
-- and an aging, weakened heart can fail when required to
pump too high a volume of blood.
   Traversing the aisles, the shopper contents himself with
picking out products that claim they are lower in sodium than
competing brands and reading the labels to make sure they
are. (Meanwhile, the most effective measure to limit sodium
consumption has been taken back in his kitchen, where some of
the holes in the salt shaker have been taped over.)
   Going on, he almost grounds his vessel on a shoal of
Redi-Wip non-dairy dessert topping. "Contains no milk or milk
fat," the label says seductively. But the lookout spies in
the fine print the revelation that "partially hydrogenated
palm kernel oil" is the second most plentiful ingredient.
Which calls for a return to the arcane world of fats.
   There are three chemically different kinds of fats in
food. In saturated fats, hydrogen atoms are bound to all the
carbon atoms in the molecule; it is saturated with hydrogen.
In polyunsaturated fat, two or more pairs of carbon atoms
lack attached hydrogen. In monounsaturated fats, one pair
lacks it.
   Scientists don't understand the mechanism involved, but
they do know that replacing saturated fats in the diet with
polyunsaturated reduces blood cholesterol, and with it
coronary risk. The Redi-Wip? Its label fails to note that
palm kernel oil is 82% saturated fat in its natural state.
"Partial hydrogenation" makes it even more so. Feeling his
arteries constrict, the navigator goes on to meat and
seafood.
   He avoids cuts of meat heavily marbled or streaked with
solid fat, knowing that this very solidity means it is heavy
in the saturated variety. Most animal fats are 45% saturated.
A notable and healthy exception is fish; if fish carried such
a load of saturated fat, they'd become stiff as boards in
cold water and couldn't swim. So the navigator regretfully
sweeps past the spareribs, a favorite, and picks up instead
some whitefish chubs for Sunday breakfast.
   He needs his charts for other choices, for there are no
labels and appearances deceive. Liver and shellfish, for
example, look lean and heart-healthy, but a heavy dose of
cholesterol lurks hidden in their tissues. A lean sirloin is
better, but it still has 76 milligrams of cholesterol built
into every three-ounce serving.
   This doesn't mean sirloin, or foods like it, should be
shunned. In shopping for a healthy heart, neither basic
nutrition nor appetite appeal should be pitched overboard
just to shave off a few calories of fat or a few score
milligrams of cholesterol. What any shopper needs to do is
make sensible trade-offs and watch portion sizes.
   The navigator again consults the work of Dr. Brown of
Mount Sinai medical center. The doctor smiles on the
ingestion of three or four portions of meat, fish and/or
poultry daily, so long as the ingester is "a large person"
and isn't piggish. "It is advisable to keep the portion size
at four ounces for chicken and other poultry as well as for
meat," he writes magisterially. "This will be reduced to
approximately three ounces by broiling, providing a serving
approximately the size of a deck of playing cards."
   The navigator, whose usual portion runs more to the size
of a Robert Ludlum paperback, takes heed. A chicken and some
lean round steak are taken on board.
   Feeling righteous, he tacks over to baked goods and snack
foods, hoping to spend in tasty fashion some of the reserve
he has amassed by being so sensible about everything else. He
blows 89 grams of fat on Kellogg's Common Sense oat-bran
waffles, justifying the purchase thus: He likes waffles,
there are no egg yolks in these waffles, and the oat bran is
supposed to help ream out the arteries (there is now
considerable doubt that it does, to the consternation of an
industry that has filled the shelves with every conceivable
oat-bran product short of toilet paper).
   Other products look fairly benign and affordable under his
fat allowance, but the navigator discovers illusion here.
Frookie Seven-Grain Oatmeal Cookies ("no cholesterol, low in
saturated fat") have only 45 calories -- per cookie. Doritos
Nacho Cheese tortilla chips ("as always cholesterol free")
have a fairly modest seven grams of fat -- for every 15
chips. Who ever stopped at one cookie or 15 chips? No thanks.
   Almost finished with his circumnavigation of the store,
the shopper returns to the perils of aisle 2 and its 60 feet
of vegetable oils clamoring for his attention. Most of them
say they are "cholesterol free," which, as vegetable
products, they always were anyway. The issue here is not
cholesterol or calories -- almost all the oils have 120
calories per tablespoonful -- but the type of fat they
contain.
   So the label on Hollywood safflower oil ("lower in
saturated fat than Mazola, Wesson and Crisco") catches the
eye. It has 11 grams of polyunsaturated fat -- the better
kind -- and only one gram of saturated fat. Not bad. Crisco
soybean oil and Mazola corn oil have eight grams of
polyunsaturated fat but two grams of the saturated kind.
   But what about Puritan canola oil, which brags that it's
94% saturated fat free, with four grams of polyunsaturated
fat and one gram of saturated fat? And Vineyard grapeseed
oil, with the same composition? Are they better or worse than
safflower oil?
   All these vegetable oils have 14 grams of total fat per
tablespoon, but in every case the amounts given for saturated
and polyunsaturated fats don't add up to 14 grams. What is
the missing fat? It has to be monounsaturated, which brings
us to the sunny shores of the Mediterranean.
   Advocates of heart-healthy nutrition have long pushed for
replacing saturated fats in the diet with polyunsaturated
ones. But some studies indicate that although the latter
lower total cholesterol, large amounts of them may increase
the risk of gallstones and reduce so-called HDL, the "good"
form of cholesterol that actually protects against heart
disease.
   The Greeks and the Italians may have an answer. Their diet
is heavy in fat -- up to 40% of calories -- but they rarely
have coronary disease. The fat they eat is mainly
monounsaturated. So Bertolli's olive oil, with 11 grams of
monounsaturated fat, goes into the basket.
   The navigator is at last ready for checkout. Only one
nagging question bothers him. Will biscuits made with olive
oil taste as good as biscuits made with old-fashioned,
bad-for-you Crisco shortening? He'll soon find out.

   Contract Bout Pits Champ vs. Promoter

   The powerful role of boxing promoters is about to face a
stiff challenge in court.
   Heavyweight champion James "Buster" Douglas, in a trial
set to begin Monday, is directing his legal blows at Don
King, the famous fight promoter. What's at stake, beyond the
careers of Messrs. King and Douglas, is the validity of the
widely used contracts that endow promoters with the muscle to
dictate where and whom their boxers fight.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A top promoter such as Mr. King may invest as much as
$600,000 to $1 million to advance a fighter's career from his
first professional bout to the hoped-for championship
(although Mr. King rarely works with a fighter just starting
out). The promoter guarantees a boxer's salary, pays his
expenses for training and travel, and supplies free tickets.
In turn, the promoter gets all or a cut of television and
ticket revenue and all merchandising rights.
   For a boxer such as Mr. Douglas, the catch is that the
promoter cushions his own risk by signing the fighter to
long-term contracts that prohibit the boxer from dealing with
other promoters. And since multimillion-dollar fight purses
rarely go to anyone but champions, smart promoters wangle
exclusive rights to control a contender's career for several
fights after a championship bout.
   That's the subject of the bitter legal dispute between
champion boxer and champion promoter. Mr. King says he is
backed solidly by American contract law, and many legal
experts agree.
   Last year, Mr. Douglas signed a contract with Mr. King
that covered the title fight and three subsequent bouts. The
contract, the latest in a series between the fighter and
promoter, gave Mr. King the right to negotiate the package
for each fight. Mr. Douglas could get out of the contract if
he were to be paid less than $1 million per bout.
   That kind of payday was highly unlikely for Mr. Douglas, a
journeyman fighter who wasn't considered championship
material. But Mr. Douglas accomplished the improbable by
beating then-undefeated heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in
February. Mr. King offered the new champ $11 million for his
first title defense, a hefty payday but not as much as Mr.
Douglas -- newly acquainted with television interviews,
magazine covers and home-town parades -- had in mind.
   An offer by Mirage Casino Hotel owner Steve Wynn was more
like it: He promised Mr. Douglas $25 million, part of a $60
million package for the rights to stage and promote two
fights at the casino in Las Vegas. Exclusive contracts such
as Mr. King's are prohibited in Nevada, and Mr. Wynn wants
the glamour fights so he can draw high rollers to his
gambling tables. Since Mr. Wynn upped the ante, other
promoters have attempted to woo Mr. Douglas with prospects of
as much as $50 million for a rematch with Mr. Tyson.
   In an effort to invalidate the King contract and gain the
freedom to negotiate with others, Mr. Douglas filed suit in
Las Vegas in February. In his complaint, Mr. Douglas contends
that he had to swallow Mr. King's terms or lose a shot at the
heavyweight championship. Mr. King had all the bargaining
power because he held the promotional rights to Mr. Tyson,
then the champion, the suit maintains. "Why should we have to
take less money?" asks John Johnson, Mr. Douglas's manager.
"Don't we have a right to say yes or no?"
   Mr. Douglas also contends that Mr. King breached the
contract when he took Mr. Tyson's side in a dispute over the
outcome of their Tokyo title fight.
   Mr. King has countersued in federal court in New York. He
is asking for more than $25 million in damages from Mr.
Douglas for breach of contract, and he seeks a court order to
stop a proposed September fight at the Mirage Casino. He's
also asking for more than $50 million from Mr. Wynn for
allegedly interfering with his contract with Mr. Douglas.
   Mr. Douglas's suit has become a rallying point for those
who denounce exclusive contracts as a form of indentured
servitude that unfairly enriches the promoters. These critics
say it's common for promoters to reap 20% and more of a
fight's revenue while the boxer's salary can amount to less
than 10%. When the promoter controls both contestants, as Mr.
King often does, he takes home twice as much for the same
work.
   A victory for Mr. Douglas might encourage a host of boxers
to tear up their contracts with promoters and enter a new era
of free agency in which they could negotiate terms on a
fight-by-fight basis. It would also weaken the flamboyant Mr.
King's powerful hold on the industry. For more than a decade,
Mr. King has had contracts with either the leading contenders
or the champion, or both, in the heavyweight division, which
commands the most prize money.
   Lawyers who deal with contracts such as Mr. Douglas's,
however, caution that exclusive agreements are generally
enforced by courts. John Sahl, who teaches sports and
entertainment law at the University of Bridgeport (Conn.),
says that such contracts are common in the boxing business
and haven't been ruled as any different than similar
arrangements in the recording industry. Personally, he says,
he views them as inherently unfair but says they are probably
not illegal.
   "They're not fighting me," says Mr. King. "They're
fighting American contract law." He insists that his
contracts are fair because they reward the promoter's risk
while giving fighters with no other backing the opportunity
to get a shot at the title. He adds that boxers do well under
the promotional contracts; he says he has negotiated paydays
of $1 million or more for about 15 fighters.
   "Buster Douglas is the best living example of the risk a
promoter takes in investing in a fighter," Mr. King says.
Indeed, before the Tyson fight, Mr. Douglas was nobody's idea
of a hot property. During his nine-year career, the Columbus,
Ohio, native compiled a 29-4-1 record but sometimes came to
fights overweight and fought listlessly. Mr. Johnson, his
manager, says he was "too nice." His father and trainer,
Billy, a former middleweight boxer, forsook him after he quit
in his title fight against Tony Tucker in 1987.
   "Nobody was interested in Douglas," says Don Duva, the
promoter who represents top heavyweight contender Evander
Holyfield. "He was a non-entity."
   Mr. King says he invested in promoting Mr. Douglas as
early as 1984 and continued to do business with him because
he saw talent in him that others didn't. He also got a boxer
to use on the "undercard," preliminary bouts at big fights.
In August 1989, Mr. Douglas gave Mr. King control of possibly
two years of his career for a promise that Mr. Tyson, whom
Mr. King also represents, would fight him. Stephen Enz, the
attorney who represented Mr. Douglas at the time, says, "We
had other offers to consider, but the road to the
championship only ran through Don King. You have to deal with
Don King on his terms."
   But despite the claims from the Douglas corner, Mike
Trainer, a lawyer and manager of middleweight champion Sugar
Ray Leonard, points out that Mr. Douglas had an alternative:
fighting all the top contenders to qualify for a guaranteed
title fight under boxing association rules, with or without
Mr. King. "He could have . . . been declared a mandatory
contender," says Mr. Trainer, "Nobody put a gun to his head.
He didn't have to sign it."
   An important side issue in the lawsuits will involve Mr.
King's role in arguing before the World Boxing Association
that Mr. Douglas should have lost the Tyson bout because the
referee allowed him too much time to get up after he was
knocked down in the eighth round. Mr. Douglas knocked Mr.
Tyson out in the 10th round.
   The question will be whether Mr. King's fiduciary duty to
Mr. Douglas obligated him to muzzle himself. Some say Mr.
King did what the contract called for -- promote his fighter
-- and that was his only duty. Others say as a promoter for
both fighters, Mr. King had a duty to remain neutral.
   Most lawyers and promoters agree that, as in his last
fight, Mr. Douglas will be an underdog in the courtroom. And
just about everyone predicts that somehow Mr. King will still
be in the picture the next time Mr. Douglas puts on his
gloves.
   Mr. King agrees: "They said I'm a scalawag, a thief, a
rapscallion, yet I continue to survive."

   Collor Plan Raises Brazil to New Height of Chaos

<LP>
   Prior to last March, it would have been hard to believe
that Brazilian economic life could be made more chaotic. But
the government found a way: The Collor Plan, named after
Brazil's new president, Fernando Collor de Mello, and
designed by Economic Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello and her
economic team.
   Introduced on March 16, the Collor Plan has been changing
by the day. Nevertheless, it is noted for these main and
often contradictory features: shrinkage in the supply of
money by freezing financial accounts, a wage and price
freeze, privatization of Brazilian state enterprises and a
string of new taxes -- on savings, wealth and on one of
Brazil's most productive sectors, agriculture. There is also
-- yet again -- a new currency, the cruzeiro, which over time
is to be exchanged on a one-to-one basis for the cruzado.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the plan was announced, sophisticated people found it
unbelievable. The economic team had confused the large stock
of money rather than the rapid creation of new money as the
cause of inflation. Consequently, the anti-inflationary
program focused on shrinking the supply of money 80% by
freezing balances in savings and checking accounts.
   As the freeze applies to the cash balances of businesses,
chaos was instant. Businesses could not pay suppliers or meet
payrolls. Industrial production dropped 15% in March. There
were widespread layoffs, and it looked like the economy was
descending into deep depression.
   Faced with an unprecedented liquidity crisis, the
government is allowing the economy to be reliquified
piecemeal without yet taking the sensible step of repealing
the ill-advised freeze. The individualized approach to
lifting the freeze has introduced new distortions and
privileges, as the monetary position of different persons and
groups is governed by different regulations.
   For example, April 25 brought six decrees freeing frozen
funds. One was for pregnant women with due dates between
April 25 and June 1, allowing them to unfreeze 60,000
cruzados and exchange them for new cruzeiros if they give
birth in private clinics. Another allows pensioners over age
65 who are exempt from income tax to unfreeze 25,000 cruzados
(converted to cruzeiros) monthly for three months.
   Banks, initially affected by the freeze, now can issue new
credit to firms whose cash balances are frozen. Similarly,
the agricultural sector has been promised 40 billion
cruzeiros for the winter harvest and the marketing of the
summer crop. The auto industry, the financial sector, heavy
industry and the construction industry are also being given
exemptions to the freeze.
   Meanwhile, companies and individuals who have not yet
received a decree freeing their balances are resorting to
innovative measures. One company traded orange juice for
frozen funds that can be freed to pay taxes. Others,
apparently, are managing to borrow against their frozen
accounts.
   The Collor Plan introduced a new 8% tax on savings if paid
by May 18; after that date the tax jumps to 20%. A similar 8%
tax applies to share values held. If this wealth tax is not
paid by May 18, shareowners will be hit with a 25%
transactions tax on the sale of shares. In addition, there is
a 25% capital-gains tax that apparently has been delayed
until 1991. There is also a 35% transactions tax on the sale
of precious metals.
   With Brazil's stock markets down 50% or more, this would
seem to be the right time to pay one's wealth tax and to make
trades to restructure one's portfolio -- if one thinks the
taxes are going to stick. Like the freeze, the taxes may be
reduced or rolled back. The government seems to have little
understanding of the Collor Plan's disastrous impact on
Brazil's capital markets. Revisions of the tax code are
constantly announced, and no one, including the government,
knows what is coming next.
   President Collor daily announces policies only to retract
or change them the following day. Recently, he announced that
his veto on the previous day of a salary provision, which
would raise the minimum wage by 6% every two months, was a
mistake. Confronted by economic reality that they don't
understand, his economic team has retreated into daily
announcements of measures to increase liquidity.
   The impact on inflation of this mixture of liquidity
drains and injections, fixed prices, higher minimum wages,
supply disruptions and 300,000 factory workers on paid leave
is difficult to discern. The government claims zero inflation
for April. But, of course, it has not stopped printing money
to cover the budget deficit. Trade union economists say April
inflation was 24%, and a University of Sao Paulo study says
inflation was 68% during the first three weeks of the Collor
Plan. Shortages seem to reflect repressed inflation in
price-controlled sectors.
   To be sure, there are sensible elements to the plan --
including privatization of state companies and plans to open
up the highly protected economy to imports. But these
sensible elements have been lost in the confusion and chaos.
You can't open up an economy that is becoming more regulated
on the inside. If anything, even more protection and
privilege can be expected as the regulators' plans begin to
fall apart.
   As to privatization plans, although announced with
fanfare, directors of targeted state companies speak with
confidence of the continuation of state ownership and
announce their own grandiose plans.
   For example, the new president of Embrafilme, the
Brazilian state film company, in charge of dissolving the
enterprise is instead planning projects for the future. The
president of Petrobras, the state petroleum company, parts of
which are slated for privatization, recently revealed plans
to expand distribution into external markets.
   According to a lengthy article in the Brazilian news
magazine Veja, the main result of the Collor Plan has been a
rash of heart attacks and stress-related illnesses.
Brazilians, known for laughing at their cruel disasters,
describe the Collor Plan as "a neutron bomb that leaves
people alive but destroys everything around them." No, says
another Brazilian, the Collor Plan "preserves installations,
while destroying people and other living things."
   Assuming the economy is reliquified and depression
avoided, the danger of the Collor Plan is that it will
convince Brazilians that not even drastic measures can cure
the economy's ills. It was certainly a mistake for Mr.
Collor, who was elected with hope and care, to implement a
secret economic plan. If the plan had been publicly debated,
its ill-conceived basis -- the freezing of bank balances --
would have been exposed, and the country and its new
president would have been spared needless chaos.
   Mr. Collor needs to focus on privatizing the
deficit-ridden state companies. Once he does that, the
government will no longer have to print money to cover their
losses. As the injection of new money slowed, the inflation
rate would level off. Economic stability depends upon stable
property rights. Inflation, freezes, wealth confiscation and
arbitrary procedures destroy confidence by undermining
property rights. Brazil cannot make a comeback unless
property rights make a comeback.

   Tabasco-Sauce Maker Remains Hot After 125 Years

   On a remote island deep in Louisiana swampland, the
McIlhenny family has spent the past 125 years quietly
churning its peppers into one of the hottest sellers around:
Tabasco sauce.
   In all those years, the family has never changed the
recipe, and it has introduced only three other Tabasco
products. It shuns advances in food technology. And workers
still handpick the peppers.
   But the strategy -- if it can be called that -- has
worked. McIlhenny Co., based on Avery Island, has captured,
and kept, the biggest market share in hot sauces -- almost a
third of it -- even though the fiery brew costs considerably
more than most other brands. It still profits every day from
developing the first widely sold hot sauce and, in essence,
creating the market.
   As the company creeps into the 21st century, though, it
feels pressure to expand. Profits must be divided among an
ever-growing number of family shareholders -- about 90 now.
Thus, the company is seeking new uses for the sauce and has
begun an aggressive marketing campaign.
   Meanwhile, McIlhenny still enjoys its rare status as a
"fortress" company -- an entrenched company whose market
strength often seems impenetrable. These businesses enjoy
brand recognition that companies far larger can only envy.
This series of articles on such companies will show how
several of them reached their favored positions -- and how
some are struggling to retain their status.
   Even among fortress companies, McIlhenny has an enviable
position. Tabasco sauce is sprinkled on foods from chili to
chop suey in more than 100 countries. Packages are printed in
15 languages. The Japanese, the second biggest users, dash
the sauce on spaghetti and pizza. About half the volume is
sold to Americans.
   So popular is the sauce that many think the brand name is
generic. In fact, the name is a Mexican word; "Grandpere just
liked the sound of it," says vice president Paul McIlhenny.
The closely held firm won't reveal sales or profits, but some
analysts estimate sales are more than $50 million a year and
growing.
   The U.S. hot-sauce market has nearly doubled in the past
five years; estimates vary from $37 million to $69 million
for 1989. Profiting from surging interest in Tex-Mex and
Cajun food and spicy chicken wings, most hot sauces have done
well. Nonetheless, many chefs insist on Tabasco, mainly
because it's so concentrated.
   "I may use 10 drops of Tabasco, but I can trust that 10
drops," says Paul Prudhomme, Louisiana's celebrated chef,
who's cooked with Tabasco for 33 years now. "It pushes the
natural flavor of the food. There's an afterglow in your
mouth."
   Even among competitors, the brand commands respect. Durkee
French Foods, second in market share with 22%, touts that it
sells more of its Red Hot sauce based on volume. But,
"McIlhenny is laughing all the way to the bank," says Cal
Garrett, a manager at the Cincinnati-based company. "They've
built a great niche."
   Roughly 10% of Tabasco users consume 40% of the sauce. But
the very essence of Tabasco's success -- a distinctively hot
taste -- keeps the two-ounce bottles in cupboards of the
average consumer for nine months. So fifth-generation
President and Chief Executive Officer Edward "Ned" McIlhenny
Simmons is on a mission to make Tabasco as commonplace as
salt and pepper. "We'd like one in your kitchen and one on
your dining room table," he says.
   After years of advertising Tabasco in trade and consumer
publications as a condiment for recipes, McIlhenny Co. now
pushes new uses with a boldness unseen in its past. Just five
years ago, for example, it ran its first television
commercial.
   Various 30-second spots now show Avery Island natives
topping all sorts of foods with Tabasco. In print ads pushing
a "power breakfast," the company suggests adding a few drops
to hash browns, grits and omelets. "That'll get your engine
started," the ad says.
   The first natural extension of the Tabasco line came about
16 years ago: a Bloody Mary mix. The company says this
remains a "profitable addition" to its line.
   In 1982, the company introduced a picante sauce, a
stew-like dip popular in the Southwest, which is merely
limping along against more established brands. Recently, the
company launched "Tabasco 7-Spice Chili Recipe," which is
being test-marketed in five major U.S. cities.
   Mr. Simmons defends the cautious marketing approach,
saying, "We could wash the chili sauce out tomorrow, and we'd
have a few gray hairs, and we'd have spent a few dollars, but
we're not going to have bankers crawling all over us."
   Nonetheless, the company is considering a new brand line,
McIlhenny Farms, that would include pepper jellies, barbecue
sauces and mustards for the gourmet section of supermarkets.
   Gourmet brand extensions were the last thing Edmund
McIlhenny fretted about when he developed the fiery flagship
product. Driven from Avery Island by the Civil War, the
self-made New Orleans banker returned to find the family home
and surrounding sugar fields and salt domes in ruins. Among
the things left standing were pepper plants from Mexican
"Capsicums Frutescens" seeds, which he had planted before the
family left.
   Mr. McIlhenny found that by grinding the peppers, aging
them and adding vinegar and salt, he could make a pepper
sauce, a novelty that gave zest to the bland food prevalent
after the war.
   In 1869, Mr. McIlhenny poured the sauce in some 350
bottles -- mostly old cologne bottles -- and sent them to
food brokers around the area. The following year, he received
orders for thousands more.
   The shape of the bottles has changed little, as has the
process of making the sauce. From August to about November,
workers cull the island's 75 acres of peppers. A mechanized
picker was tried years ago but today sits idle in a
warehouse.
   To reduce labor costs and spread the risk of losing the
vulnerable crops to disease, the company says it raises 90%
of its peppers from the same seeds in Columbia, Honduras and
Venezuela.
   The peppers, chopped into small bits and packed in
50-gallon white oak casks, age for three warm seasons, almost
like fine wine. The company experimented with plastic vats
once, but tossed them aside.
   After the sauce is strained and poured into huge blending
tanks with distilled vinegar, a big mechanical arm stirs the
brew five minutes every hour. This is one of the few breaks
with the past, when workers made the rounds with wooden
paddles.
   The pace of change at Avery Island could pick up, of
course. Says Paul McIlhenny: "We've gotten more aggressive
than previously, and I think the next hundred years will see
us trying even more new things."

   NEW YORK -- The Treasury sold $10 billion of 30-year bonds
at an unexpectedly low yield of 8.84%, strengthening the
belief among investors that interest rates are heading lower.
   Yesterday's sale completed the Treasury's huge $30.5
billion quarterly note and bond auction, which is closely
watched by Wall Street and Washington for hints of the
direction of interest rates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The average yield of 8.84% on the 30-year bonds was the
lowest at an auction since last May, when the yield was
9.11%. And yesterday's yield was even lower than the 8.88%
average yield on the Treasury's 10-year notes that were
auctioned Tuesday. Long-term rates are generally higher than
those with shorter maturities, so the discrepancy reflects
that rates were falling even as the auction proceeded.
   Traders said that a 8.84% yield on the 30-year bond was
possible because large institutional investors rushed to lock
in current interest rates on their belief that U.S. interest
rates are on the way down.
   "We had excellent domestic institutional demand. This was
a good auction," said John Costas, co-manager of government
trading at First Boston Corp. He said, however, that some
dealers may have been disappointed that Japanese demand for
the 30-year bonds was lukewarm. But at First Boston, which
has far more U.S. than foreign customers, "our tenders {bids
from investors} were the strongest in six or seven auctions,"
Mr. Costas said.
   Michael Moran, manager of government trading at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Inc., said big investors "are
taking a bullish stance in the marketplace." Mr. Moran noted
that some portfolio managers at insurance companies, pension
funds and mutual funds bought bonds at the auction in an
effort to extend the length of their portfolios, a sign that
these money managers believe the bond market is ready to
rally.
   The success of the government's bond auction is likely to
extend beyond Wall Street. Since other long-term interest
rates often track bond yields, analysts said that some
consumer borrowing costs may begin to ease somewhat.
   "Mortgage rates are coming down even as we speak," said
Paul Havemann, a vice president at HSH Associates, which
compiles mortgages rate information. Mr. Havemann said that
rates on conventional mortgages, which rose from 9.8% in
early January to about 10.6% last week, fell yesterday to
about 10.5% and will probably fall further today. Prior to
the bond auction, economists worried that bond yields would
exceed 9% at the auction, which prompted some mortgage
lenders to raise rates. But now, "just about every lender we
survey said they are cutting rates," said Mr. Havemann.
   Of course, that could change instantly if any new economic
indicators show that inflation is accelerating or that
economic activity is robust. Some news about inflation is due
out today when the Labor Department releases the latest
producer price index, a measure of inflation.
   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
expect, on average, that the PPI rose 0.2% last month. A much
higher inflation rate could depress the bond market and push
interest rates higher. The PPI declined 0.2% in March and was
flat in February.
   Although yesterday's 30-year bond sale was considered a
relatively good auction, analysts noted that demand was not
as great as in the first two legs of the refunding.
Nonetheless, the 30-year bond traded slightly higher after
the auction, with the yield slipping to 8.81% in when-issued
trading activity.
   Bond dealers estimated that Japanese buyers purchased
between 25% and 30% of the $10 billion of 30-year bonds,
slightly less than estimates of Japanese buying in the
auctions on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   But, "in light of all the fears ahead of the refunding, it
seems to have gone pretty well," said Kathleen Camilli, chief
economist for Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.
   The government's quarterly bond auction attracted far more
interest than expected among individual investors, who showed
a hearty appetite for the three-year notes sold Tuesday at an
average yield of 8.74% and the 10-year notes sold Wednesday.
   But individuals weren't as big buyers of the 30-year
bonds. The Treasury said it received $463 million of
noncompetitive bids, which come mainly from individual
investors, for the 30-year bonds. That was up modestly from
$442 million of noncompetitive bids at the previous auction
in February.
   One measure of the below-average demand by dealers at the
auction yesterday was the so-called bid-to-cover ratio. The
Treasury received 1.99 bids for every one it accepted at
yesterday's auction. That was down from a bid-to-cover ratio
of 2.0-to-one in the previous six auctions. But bidding at
yesterday's auction was stronger than the last 30-year
auction in February, where the government received 1.84 bids
for every one it accepted.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices ended modestly higher after the
Treasury's 30-year bond sale.
   The current benchmark 30-year bond rose more than 1/4
point, or $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield eased to 8.83% from 8.86%.
   Short-term interest rates moved lower. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills was 7.72% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 7.96% while the rate on six-month bills was 7.72%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.12%.
   Here are details of yesterday's 30-year bond auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended with strong gains.
   Traders said the advance reflected a modest squeeze on
some dealers, who have been banking on heavy sales of
securities by the Resolution Trust Corp.
   While the RTC did sell mortgage securities late last week
and early this week, the government conservator for failed
thrifts wasn't a sizable seller yesterday.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9% securities
for May delivery ended at 94 22/32, up 14/32, and its 9 1/2%
securities at 97 5/32, up 12/32. Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.'s 9 1/2% issues was quoted at 96 7/8, up 10/32.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. ended
mixed on news that the publisher has terminated talks for the
sale of certain assets.
   The news, which was released late Wednesday, was
considered negative by most high-yield analysts. However, the
market's reaction didn't turn out to be quite so harsh.
   Although bids for Harcourt Brace junk bonds fell as much
as 3 points in early trading, prices started firming after it
became apparent that there were more buyers than sellers.
   Harcourt's 13% senior notes due in 1997 finished at 93
3/4, slightly higher than Wednesday's closing levels. The
other senior issue of Harcourt junk bonds, the 13 3/4% senior
subordinated debentures maturing in 1999, lost about 1/2
point to end at 77 1/2.
   Both issues had rallied strongly last month on news that
Harcourt was involved in talks with Toronto's Thomson Corp.
for the sale of certain assets.
   Market participants had bid up the senior bonds on the
expectation that if an asset sale took place the company
would use proceeds to retire the bonds at a premium.
   Peter Karches, head of the high-yield department at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., said that despite Wednesday's news, Harcourt
bonds are still attractive on a fundmental basis.
   "People recognize the bonds are trading at relatively
cheap levels," said Karches. "It's going to take more
fundamental news about the company for the bonds to fall."
   Roger Gordon, a high-yield analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp., said the collapse of asset-sale
talks is not critical for a firm like Harcourt Brace.
   "The company is not under the gun to sell assets or
restructure debt," Gordon said. "Our point of view regarding
HBJ's high-yield securities is that the operating cash flow
will be more than sufficient to meet debt service obligations
over the next couple of years."
   Meanwhile, the junk bonds of Interco Inc. were slightly
lower on news that the St. Louis-based furniture and shoe
maker won't make interest payments due June 15 on its bonds.
Instead, the company has proposed that bondholders accept a
debt restructuring of nearly $900 million.
   Interco's 13 3/4% senior subordinated debentures due 2000
lost two points to end at 26. The bonds are now trading
without accrued interest, a sign that the market doesn't
expect the company to make future interest payments.
   Interco's senior bond issue, the 8 7/8% notes of 1993,
were unscathed by yesterday's news, and finished the session
unchanged.
   In the broader market for junk bonds, speculative-grade
securities with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at
all, prices were slightly firmer.
   Investment-grade corporate debt ended generally 1/8 point
higher.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   New York City drew record demand from Wall Street dealers
yesterday when it auctioned $900 million of revenue
anticipation notes.
   The city said it received 100 bids totaling $9.3 billion
for the notes, which will be used to help the city meet its
financial obligations until it receives funding from the
state. The state aid has been delayed because a New York
state budget has not been adopted.
   Bond dealers said the unusually strong bidding for the
notes, which caused yields to come in lower than expected,
reflects political rather than fundamental factors.
   New York City is currently reviewing its underwriting
team. Therefore, firms eager to illustrate an interest in
doing business with the city submitted bids at yesterday's
auction when they normally might not have done so.
   The largest portion of the notes, $400 million, was won by
a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group. The six other groups
that won portions of the note deal are Dillon Read &amp; Co. with
$200 million; Bear Stearns with $100 million; First Boston
Corp. with $75 million; Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and PaineWebber
Inc., each with $50 million; and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. with $25
million.
   Interest rates on the notes, which mature June 29, 1990,
ranged from 6.247% to 6.419%.
   Traders said that New York City notes normally would come
at prices to yield about 6.50%, but a "political bid" pushed
the yields lower, they said.
   In trading yesterday, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds due 2018 rose 3/4 to 97, yielding 7.44%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese Finance Ministry sold 300 billion yen of
20-year bonds yesterday at a coupon rate of 6.8% and at a
price to yield 6.739%.
   Although the event represented the first time the Japanese
government sold 20-year bonds in a year, traders said that
most investors paid little attention to the sale and instead
focused on the U.S. Treasury's auction of 30-year bonds.
   That's because rates on the U.S. Treasury securities are
much higher than rates on comparable Japanese securities. The
new 30-year bonds auctioned yesterday had a coupon rate of
8.75% at a price to yield 8.84%.
   "It would have been better if the coupon (on the Japanese
20-year bond) was 7%," said a dealer at one of the large
Japanese brokerage firms. At that level, he said, the bond
sale would have drawn more enthusiasm from investors.
   The Ministry last issued 20-year bonds in May 1989,
offering 503.2 billion yen of bonds with a coupon rate of 5%.

   In Concert: Flutists' Blowout

   New York -- The job of putting on one orchestral premiere
is daunting enough for most musicians, but four in a single
concert, all of them for flute, smacks of artist masochism.
Nonetheless, flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson recently
brought his Solisti New York Chamber Orchestra together with
three other prominent flutists for just such a blowout in
Town Hall.
   The concert was the culmination of a project that began
several years ago, when Mr. Wilson and fellow flutists Carol
Wincenc and Paula Robison applied for a grant from the
National Endowment for the Arts to commission works from
three composers. Each flutist would play all the concertos
and premiere one, thereby ensuring at least three
performances of each work. After some haggling, the trio
tapped Joseph Schwantner ("an established composer,"
according to Mr. Wilson), Robert Beaser ("a new kid on the
block") and Paul Schoenfield ("someone from out of left
field").
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Only Mr. Beaser finished his piece, "Song of the Bells,"
on schedule, and Ms. Wincenc premiered it with the St. Paul
Chamber Orchestra in 1987. Cut to 1989-90. Mr. Wilson and
Solisti New York have come to an agreement with Town Hall,
the only presenter in New York willing to take on an evening
of new flute concertos, and they have a concert date. To
round out the program, they have added futuristic flutist
Robert Dick performing his own new concerto. A recording for
New World is lined up. So where are the other concertos? Uhh
. . . they're coming along. Mr. Wilson realizes that
conducting four new works and playing one will probably send
him round the bend, so he enlists the services of Alasdair
Neale, assistant conductor of the San Francisco Symphony,
former flute player, and a crack new-music learner. A few
months before the concert, Ms. Wincenc has the solo part of
the Schoenfield concerto. A week before the concert, the
orchestral parts arrive. "They were full of errors," Mr.
Wilson says. "There were no meters in the score, no bar
lines. . . . Alasdair likes a challenge, but . . . ."
   Conductors are used to the last-minute nature of
premieres, but they don't usually have to deal with more than
one dilatory composer at a time. The entire Schwantner
concerto also showed up about a week before the performance,
and it was hard.
   "Luckily it was beautifully copied and there were no
revisions," Mr. Wilson says. There were other surprises as
well. "No matter what you ask for, you get something
different," says Mr. Wilson of the orchestrations originally
specified in the commissions. The Beaser piece required four
horns. "If the composer says, all I need is one more horn to
make a masterpiece, can you say no?" Mr. Wilson asks. Mr.
Dick's piece called for steel drums, and steel drum sets
aren't uniform in the location of pitches on the instrument.
"Two days before the concert, our percussionists got the
drums and the parts and freaked out," Mr. Wilson recalls.
   Mr. Schoenfield's "Klezmer Rondos" needed a saxophone,
tuba and trombone for its klezmer band, which was ostensibly
meant to suggest the sound of East European Jewish villages
of yore. It also required a singer.
   Five rehearsals, up from the usual three, weren't enough,
but the orchestra coped obligingly with the messy parts and
frequent changes. "They are an easygoing group," Mr. Wilson
says.
   The evening, as you might have supposed, turned out to be
a study of contrasting flute style. After an elegant
performance of Ives's "The Unanswered Question," with the
four flutists (covering all the original wind parts)
responding to the trumpet soloist in the balcony, Ms. Robison
took the stage for Mr. Beaser's "Song of the Bells." The
orchestra laid out a cushioned, exotic tapestry of sound,
from which Ms. Robison, ever a direct and uncomplicated
performer, soared triumphant, like a breath of clear air.
   Mr. Dick's New York club-style attire -- green jacket,
white-spotted black shirt and tie -- announced that his
"Concerto for Flute/Bass Flute, Strings and Percussion" was
going to be from a different musical planet. No more tonal
romanticism: Here was the flute making whistles, multiple
tones and noises like escaping steam. Mr. Dick's eerie sounds
were picked up and amplified by the sound of a violin bow
drawn across a xylophone, and they gathered momentum for the
syncopated, jocular finale. The thud of the bass flute cut
through any preconceptions about the ethereal sound of the
instrument. What noise will he make next, one wondered. The
effect was engaging, but more curious and entertaining than
expressive.
   With Mr. Schwantner's "A Play of Shadows," Mr. Wilson
returned us to the tonal universe. Here again, as in the
Beaser concerto, a harp in the orchestra provided a foil for
the flute. The concerto sounded a lot like Mr. Schwantner's
other pieces; the symmetrical form and the opening and
closing glissandos recalled "A Sudden Rainbow." But
soft-edged, coloristic and Schwantnerian as it was, it was
also more rhythmically jaunty than the Beaser concerto. Mr.
Wilson gave the virtuosic solo part a nuanced intensity.
   The finale, Mr. Schoenfield's "Klezmer Rondos," was indeed
a voice from the shtetl: Yiddish folk melodies in the flute,
a wailing saxophone, a slow, circus march with tambourine,
and finally, the flute commenting on a despairing Yiddish
text about a beautiful, cold girl who comes to a sad end,
sung by a baritone, Douglas Webster. The piece was packed
with local color and entertainment, though the vocal part
didn't add much. Ms. Wincenc, resplendent in a red gown, and
with an edge and abandon to her flute playing, lent an air of
drama to the evening.
   The three commissions have been recorded (Mr. Dick's piece
wasn't included because it hadn't been part of the original
deal, and it wouldn't have fit into the basically tonal cast
of the recording), and the three flutists are now looking for
other places to perform the concertos. Mr. Wilson is happy
with the commissioning experience and says John Adams,
Michael Torke, and John Harbison have all promised him
concertos. Whether he would take on four premieres at a go
again is another question. "If you'd asked me the day before
the concert, I'd have said never again," he says. "But now --
well, sure."

   Ten Boston University Trustees Hold
   Stakes in Firm Supported by the School

   BOSTON -- Investments by Boston University in a
biotechnology company came under increasing fire after
disclosure that 10 of the school's trustees own stakes in the
company through a limited partnership, raising
conflict-of-interest issues.
   Questions about the school's investment in the company
have dogged the Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign of John
Silber, on leave from his post as Boston University's
president. Mr. Silber, known for his strong opinions and
abrasive style, in 1987 spearheaded Boston University's
investment in Seragen Inc., a Hopkinton, Mass., start-up
company that is developing anti-cancer drugs. Critics assert
the investment represents an inappropriately risky use of
school funds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Silber has defended the investment, asserting that
each year it represents less than 3% of the school's $570
million operating budget and supports important medical
research.
   Since 1987, the school has invested more than $60 million
in Seragen, which isn't expected to be profitable until 1995.
Critics note that the school's total investment in Seragen is
the equivalent of about a third of its endowment and related
funds. Boston University owns a 68.3% stake in Seragen and
has been funding its continuing operations at a cost of about
$13 million annually. The school has written off some $26
million of its Seragen investments, offset by an $11 million
gain from the sale of a former Seragen unit.
   The Boston Herald, quoting unidentified sources, reported
that 10 of the 52 members of the school's board of trustees
own stakes in Seragen through Commonwealth Partners, a
limited partnership set up by the school. None of the
trustees, including Boston University's treasurer, Charles W.
Smith, could be reached for comment. Mr. Silber, who wasn't
one of the named investors in Seragen, declined to comment.
   In a written statement, Boston University said
Commonwealth bought less than 0.5% of Seragen's stock "well
after the university had already purchased the controlling
interest in the company." The school asserted that the
investment doesn't represent a conflict of interest for the
parties involved.
   But some present and former faculty members disagreed. "If
the trustees' reported investment in Seragen is true, I would
think it represents a definite conflict of interest," said
Henry Morgan, former dean of Boston University's school of
business and an outspoken critic of the Seragen investment.
"If {the trustees} stand to personally gain from {the
school's} investment, I'm not sure they can make an
independent judgment on whether its a good investment for the
university."
   Added Bernice Buresh, a former journalism professor at the
school who resigned in 1988 because of an unrelated dispute
with Mr. Silber: "There is a feeling that the trustees should
be scrutinizing {the Seragen} investment instead of jumping
on the bandwagon."

   Panic in the Streets:
   Heart Disease Can Kill, but Many
   Americans Are Needlessly Scared to Death

   THE MESSAGE, BROADCAST on everything from cornflakes boxes
to the evening news, comes across loud and clear: Heart
disease is a killer.
   In response, Americans have leaped onto exercise
treadmills, gobbled more oat-bran muffins and enrolled in
seminars on the benefits of yoga in stress reduction. Much of
this has been positive: Preventive habits are one reason
heart-attack deaths are declining across the nation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But some doctors are concerned that the heart-warning
barrage has produced another, more insidious reaction: fear.
   While riding on a Washington subway several years ago,
Shari Young suddenly became aware that her heart was racing.
Her breathing also didn't seem right, the 29-year-old
housewife recalls. Having read about the symptoms of heart
disease, Ms. Young quickly concluded: "I'm having a heart
attack."
   For four years -- despite reassurances from many doctors
-- Ms. Young was convinced there was something wrong with her
heart. The frightening episodes continued. Finally, she was
diagnosed as having panic syndrome, a disorder that can lead
to spontaneous bursts of both psychological and physiological
symptoms that mimic heart attacks.
   We are, it appears, fast becoming a nation of
heartattackphobes, so paranoid that we panic at the slightest
twinge that takes place anywhere even close to the chest.
Many doctors can tell stories of patients who, after they
feel a heart palpitation, a tightness in their chest, or an
unusual shortness of breath, become falsely alarmed and race
off to the emergency room. Some of the patients who show up
in emergency rooms complaining of heart-attack symptoms or
visit their doctors' offices seeking reassurance are
anxiously overreacting to something they've seen or heard
about heart attacks, physicians say.
   "There's been enough in print now that the general public
is aware of chest-pain syndrome," says C. Richard Conti, a
University of Florida professor and immediate past president
of the American College of Cardiology. "One of the problems
with promoting chest-pain awareness is that people interpret
pains as heart attacks that aren't. It's a two-edged sword.
We don't want to have people needlessly rushing to the
emergency room, but we don't want to have them ignoring
danger, either."
   Some doctors, in fact, flatly advise patients never to
take their pulse. "If you're not a trained physician, it's
easy to become alarmed about slight changes in the rhythm of
the heart," says Isadore Rosenfeld, a professor at Cornell
University Medical College.
   But even cardiologists aren't immune to fears about the
heart. A recent Wall Street Journal survey of 400
cardiologists found that 25% said their day-to-day life
styles are affected by a fear of having a heart attack.
   After nationwide television viewers watched footage of
Loyola Marymount University basketball player Hank Gathers as
he suffered a fatal heart attack during a game, one Chicago
cardiologist said a number of young patients anxiously
telephoned his office.
   "It triggered a flurry of additional concern" from
patients who have been diagnosed as having abnormal heart
rhythms but whose conditions "certainly aren't as disabling"
as that of Hank Gathers, says Richard Kehoe, a cardiologist
at the Illinois Masonic Medical Center. "They were on the
anxious side. They'd say, `Hey, Doc. This isn't going to
happen to me, is it?'"
   At Multiplex, a 5,000-member health club in Deerfield,
Ill., physical trainers say they are showered with questions
based on the health and fitness issues of the day. "When the
hot buttons are pushed by the media, we get a tremendous
response," says Dawn Norman, general manager of the club.
People come in and say I read an article and . . ."
   The problem may be exacerbated by the often confusing
messages people receive. One day, the news trumpets the value
of oat bran. Then, studies appear suggesting that oat bran is
of limited value. At one moment, an aspirin or two a day is
touted as an effective deterrent, but as soon as the medicine
cabinet is adequately stocked with a long-term supply,
research finds that daily aspirin could cause other
significant health problems.
   "It's a true problem," says David B. Carmichael, medical
director of the Cardiovascular Institute at Scripps Memorial
Hospital in La Jolla, Calif. "The information process is so
superlative now that the information gets into people's hands
before we in the medical field have a chance to decipher it.
A lot of people go through agony worrying about things that
add up in the mind as something being wrong with the heart."
   All of which has left health-conscious Americans
frustrated and bewildered, trying to appropriately respond to
everything they hear. One result, says John Roglieri of
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, is that
some people sacrifice "the quality of their lives and
needlessly give up some of the nice, basic enjoyments in
life."

   Bolivia and Brazil Reach Accord on Plan
   To Cut $300 Million of Each Other's Debt

   WASHINGTON -- Bolivia will buy as much as $300 million of
Brazil's foreign bank debt and exchange it at face value for
its own obligations to Brazil, Bolivian planning minister
Enrique Garcia Rodriguez said.
   Under an arrangement approved by both countries, Bolivia
is buying the Brazilian debt on the secondary market, where
it sells at between 25.5 cents and 27.5 cents for each dollar
of face value. Brazil then is allowing Bolivia to exchange
the debt at face value for Bolivian debt held by Brazil, the
minister said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plan could enable Bolivia to cancel its $300 million
debt to Brazil for as little as $75 million. Bolivia already
has bought Brazilian government debt with a face value of
about $100 million, Mr. Rodriguez said.
   The arrangement should be beneficial to both countries.
Besides allowing Bolivia to pay off obligations at a discount
of as much as 75%, it helps Brazil reduce its $110 billion of
foreign debt. Brazil hasn't made payments on its bank debt in
recent months, but if it resumes debt service it would be
expected to pay interest on the full face value of the debt.
By getting rid of $300 million in foreign debt now, Brazil is
removing an obligation that could cost it about $30 million a
year in interest payments in the future.
   Banks, companies and even a few individuals trade Latin
American and other Third World bank debt on the secondary
loan market. Buying by Bolivia and by big Brazilian companies
such as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Petrobraz have been
among the strongest forces supporting the price of Brazilian
government debt, secondary loan market traders say. The big
Brazilian state companies also have used debt paper to settle
obligations with the government at favorable terms.
   Brazil is likely to get less-favorable terms from its own
bank creditors than it is giving Bolivia. Its negotiations
with them probably will start later this year. Brazil now is
many billions of dollars in arrears on its more than $60
billion of foreign commercial bank debt and also has some
"small arrears" on its debts to foreign governments,
according to Ambassador Jorio Dauster, Brazil's chief debt
negotiator.
   In an interview here this week, Brazil's economics
minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, said her country intends to
reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund and
then negotiate with its foreign government creditors and,
next, with its commercial bank creditors. An IMF team is
expected to visit Brazil in the coming weeks.
   The U.S. Interagency Country Exposure Review Committee is
expected to meet in the second half of June to discuss
Brazil's bank debt. That panel, which consists of U.S.
regulators, reviews and grades bank debt to various nations.
If it decides that a country's debt position is below
required standards, banks may be required to set aside
loan-loss reserves or in some cases even begin writing off
some of their debt.
   Meanwhile, Argentina, which like Brazil has frozen savers'
funds in recent months, also is as much as $6 billion in
arrears on its commercial-bank debt obligations. The
Argentines are close to agreeing on a program with the
International Monetary Fund, and they will start negotiating
with their foreign government and bank creditors after that.
   In a speech earlier this week in Buenos Aires, Argentine
President Carlos Saul Menem indicated that his country was
seeking a debt settlement involving $1.5 billion of new loans
and a large debt buy-back. Argentina has ambitious proposals
for privatizing state companies; it would involve allowing
investors to exchange foreign-bank debt for shares in the
privatized ventures. But this would require waivers from bank
creditors. For this and other reasons, bank creditors think
that Argentina may be eager to start negotiating soon.
   "They've told us they think they'll have an agreement with
the IMF by the end of this month," said William Rhodes, the
Citicorp executive who heads the bank committee that
negotiates with Argentina. Mr. Rhodes said he expects talks
with the banks to start soon after that.
   Meanwhile, Bolivia plans to try to buy back the last $210
million of its commercial bank debt, Mr. Rodriguez said. It
will use money provided by Switzerland, Sweden, Holland, the
World Bank and the U.S. to do this, he said. In recent years,
Bolivia bought back most of its foreign bank debt at 11 cents
for each dollar of face value.

   On Sports: Detroit's Double-Play Duo
   ----

   Detroit -- Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell, the Detroit
Tigers' second base-shortstop combination, broke into the
major leagues together on Sept. 9, 1977, in the second game
of a double-header against Boston at Fenway Park. They
remember it as though it were yesterday.
   "Lou and I were brought up from Montgomery in Double A,
and put in against the Red Sox a couple days later," recalls
Trammell. "We each had hits our first times up. Reggie
Cleveland was the Boston pitcher."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Yeah, we did real good that game," Whitaker grins in a
separate interview minutes later. "We got hits right away off
Louie Tiant. Great way to start, huh?"
   I looked it up, and Mr. Cleveland started on the mound for
Boston on that far-off afternoon, so score one for Trammell
in the historical-accuracy department. Tiant was the much
better of the two pitchers, though, so you have to admit that
Whitaker's story was better. Give him a point for theatrics.
   Things have had a way of evening out for Trammell, aged
32, and Whitaker, who'll turn 33 tomorrow. Both came up as
twiggy 160-pounders and fleshed out into gen-u-ine long-ball
threats at the plate. Both have lost, maybe, a step in the
field from their salad days but have made up for it in guile.
   Their career batting statistics going into this season
were so similar that it was almost spooky. Trammell had 1,759
hits, including 138 home runs, in 1,689 games, and a batting
average of .286. Whitaker's average was .276 on 1,7l9 hits in
1,695 games, with 149 homers. Each had the same number of
runs batted in -- 721.
   Their main distinction, however, has been in their
longevity at their demanding positions afield. Their
13-season tenure as the Tigers' double-play combo has been
the major leagues' longest, eclipsing the 11-year run of
Johnny Evers and Joe Tinker with the old Chicago Cubs
(1902-12), and the 10 years in which Davey Lopes and Bill
Russell played together for the Los Angeles Dodgers
(1972-81).
   Whether Trammell and Whitaker will end up being judged
among the best at what they do remains to be seen. Nellie Fox
and Luis Aparicio (Chicago White Sox, 1956-62) probably were
the slickest-fielding pair at the positions, while Joe Morgan
and Dave Concepcion, of the 1972-79 Cincinnati Reds, get the
nod as the best all around.
   Tiger manager Sparky Anderson managed at Cincinnati during
some of the Morgan-Concepcion years. Believing that
comparisons make enemies, he resists measuring his present
duo against his late greats. "Whitaker has a better throwing
arm than Morgan did, I will say that. But will Lou get
elected to the Hall of Fame the first year he's eligible,
like Joe? I'd better not guess," demurs Sparky.
   Alex Grammas, a Tiger coach who was a pretty fair
shortstop in his day, is more expansive. "There've been
flashier pairs around than Alan and Lou, but few as solid,"
he says. "They're both complete ballplayers who make the
plays they're supposed to make, and they play to win. You
can't ask for more than that."
   That is compliment enough for Trammell, who notes that he
and his keystone partner might have been brought to the
majors a trifle before they were ready. "I'd had just two
seasons in the minors, and Lou was a third baseman until they
put us together at Montgomery in '77," he says. "I don't
think anybody ever took as many groundballs in practice as we
did our last season in Montgomery or our first year in
Detroit."
   "I could handle the straight stuff at second right away,
but the double play was something else," Whitaker testifies.
"It took me awhile to figure out that I couldn't watch the
bag and the ball at the same time, and that after I'd made my
play, I'd better get out of the way."
   But work out the double play they did, until Trammell says
they now can perform it "without looking." Well, maybe.
Getting the hang of hitting big-league pitching was a
lonelier business and took a bit longer. At least for one of
them.
   "Some people said we'd never be hitters, but they must
have meant Alan, because I always knew I could hit," says
Lou. Uh-huh.
   But hit they did, and then some. After posting averages of
.268 and .276 his first two seasons, Trammell batted an even
.300 in his third year and has topped that four times since,
led by a .343 mark in 1987. In the 1984 World Series, in
which the Tigers beat San Diego in five games, he went nine
for 20 at the plate with two home runs and six RBIs and was
named the Series' most-valuable player.
   Whitaker batted a career-high .320 in 1983, and has
averaged 20 home runs and 69 RBIs a season over the last five
campaigns. Last year, he led the Tigers in homers with 28 and
RBIs with 85. In 1983, '84 and '85, he won the American
League Golden Glove and Silver Slugger awards for being the
best defensive and offensive player at his position. Trammell
has won two Silver Sluggers and four Golden Gloves, but never
both in one season.
   There have been rumors, whispered and published, that
Trammell and Whitaker don't get along off the field. They
deny them. "We roomed together on the road for four years,"
Alan points out. Whitaker notes that the two have
side-by-side lockers in the Tigers' dressing room, and, thus,
chat frequently. "Hey] Sometimes I get his mail, and he gets
mine," he smiles.
   Furthermore, they say, there's no rivalry between them.
"None at all. Why should there be?" asks Lou. "Of course,
he's hit .300 five times and I've just done it once, and he's
stolen more bases, but I've hit more homers, and I've got
four kids and he has three, and . . .."
   However they want to play it is fine with manager
Anderson, as long as they keep playing. His Tigers fell to a
59-103 won-lost mark last year after 11 winning seasons and
need all the help they can get. "I hope they go five more
years and get 1,000 more hits each," says Sparky. "That'd be
one less problem for me."

   CHICAGO -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
suggested several options for toughening regulation of banks
and thrifts if the federal "safety net" is expanded to cover
broader powers that may be given to those institutions.
   Mr. Greenspan, in a speech to a bankers convention here,
said the safety net has "provided measurable benefits to the
U.S. economy" including "virtually {eliminating} financial
panics." But he said the recent savings-and-loan industry
bailout shows the government must find ways to limit the
costs from failures of financial institutions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Fed chairman described the safety net as including not
only federal deposit insurance, but the Fed's lending to
banks for liquidity purposes, as well as the interbank
payments system backed by the Fed.
   A key issue facing policy makers, Mr. Greenspan said, is
whether to expand or restrict the safety net to cover the new
powers likely to be given to banks in the next few years,
such as selling insurance and participating in broader
securities-underwriting and real estate activities.
   Mr. Greenspan said that if the safety net is effectively
expanded to back such new activities, "we should probably
develop" new deposit-insurance policies such as pricing
premiums according to the riskiness of a bank's assets, and
more frequent examinations of banks.

   New Breed of Political Consultants Threatens
   To Give Negative Campaigning a Bad Name

   YOUNG HARRIS, Ga. -- The campus of Young Harris College
gleams as Lt. Gov. Zell Miller comes home to announce he is
running for governor. Watching the show unfold is the man who
scripted it -- James Carville, 45 years old, a onetime altar
boy in a Louisiana leper-colony chapel and now a top
Democratic political consultant.
   The man they call "the ragin' Cajun" is on his best
behavior, hoping to paint a pretty portrait of his candidate
for the reporters and TV crews who have come to this little
town in the mountains. Not so long ago, candidates were
allowed this sort of shining moment without fear of ambush.
But one of Mr. Carville's opponents -- Frank Greer, 43, who
is working for former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young -- is going
to ruin Mr. Carville's nice day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Greer has come up with a proposal to put a $1 million
cap on the amount a candidate can spend on TV ads. He has
primed the reporters here in Young Harris with the news. And
they aren't interested in Mr. Carville's pretty pictures.
"What about the cap?" they demand.
   Of course, Mr. Miller won't agree to a million-dollar cap.
He's raised more money than anyone else. But he can't say so.
He fudges. "We rained a little on that parade, didn't we?"
Mr. Greer chortles.
   But Mr. Carville plots revenge. The next day, his
candidate accuses Mr. Young of responsibility for an
"explosion of crime" in Atlanta, charging that he wants to
"run away" from the issue of drugs.
   Politics, as they say, ain't beanbag, and political
consulting is a business that has never won prizes for
congeniality. But now a new generation is taking over the
business -- a generation that is, if anything, meaner and
tougher than ever before. It is a generation whose aprroach
is exemplified by one of Mr. Carville's favorite sayings:
"It's hard for somebody to hit you when you've got your fist
in their face."
   "We move faster," says Don Sipple, one of the emerging
stars working Republican campaigns. "A few years ago, you'd
see five or six separate scenes in a 30-second spot. Now you
see 14. We work more with mood and music. We try to create an
impression to leave with viewers. We don't care so much about
the written word in an era when personalities are more
important than issues."
   But what Mr. Sipple and his peers do best is counterpunch.
Hit any of these people with a negative ad and you get hit
back, in a matter of hours, with a succession of body blows.
In their own perverse way, these new-generation consultants
may be part of the solution to negative campaigning. That's
because practitioners of the negative advertising arts --
frequently the old pros -- may be forced to think twice
before launching negative blitzes against these tyros.
   Mr. Carville and Mr. Greer, going head to head here in
Georgia, are prototypical new-generation consultants, though
vastly different in style, personal beliefs and background.
   With the saturnine Mr. Carville, almost always turned out
in sharply creased blue jeans, politics is something of a
game. "Campaigning is largely bull----," he says. He thinks
media pundits, such as the Washington Post's David Broder,
who call for a return to strict accounting and serious
discussion of "the issues" take it too seriously. Yet Mr.
Carville takes his own work seriously enough.
   He likes to think of himself as the man who takes
unexciting underdogs as clients and wins exciting victories
over superstars. His client in Pennsylvania in 1986 was a
Scranton Democrat, Robert Casey, who had run for governor
three times before and never gotten past the primary. His
opponent was William W. Scranton, son of a popular governor
and almost everybody's favorite to pick up his father's old
job. (The town is named for his family.)
   Mr. Scranton had vowed he wouldn't run a negative
campaign, but his campaign sent out 600,000 pieces of mail
attacking Mr. Casey's ethics. Mr. Carville says he heard
about the mailing when he came back to campaign headquarters
from the movies. "It was my 42nd birthday and the movie was
`Peggy Sue Got Married' and I was still in tears and we were
eight points down in the polls with 10 days to go."
   Mr. Carville began counterpunching. He called reporters
and told them the mailer was outrageous. They wrote stories.
Mr. Scranton replied, lamely, that he didn't know about the
mailing. So Mr. Carville ordered 600,000 blank envelopes,
loaded them up on a truck -- mountains of envelopes -- and
dumped them on a street corner near Mr. Scranton's campaign
headquarters. "The TV cameras were rolling as we asked, `How
could you send out this many envelopes and not know about
it?'"
   Mr. Carville is at Mr. Casey's side again this year, when
the governor will be under attack for his strong
anti-abortion position. It will be one of the most closely
watched contests in the nation.
   In 1988, Mr. Carville handled New Jersey Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, dull but very rich, who was opposed by Republican
Pete Dawkins, football star, Rhodes scholar, Army general,
Wall Street manager -- a walking, talking resume.
   Mr. Carville believes in focus groups, small collections
of registered voters brought together by trained interviewers
to discuss issues and react to candidates. "We showed them TV
footage of Dawkins saying things like, of all places he'd
lived he'd never known any place so full of promise as our
own Garden State. They all fell off their chairs laughing.
Maybe they like New Jersey enough, but they thought that was
ridiculous. And they all knew Dawkins had moved to New Jersey
to run for the Senate and if he'd said so it wouldn't have
been so bad.
   "All we did was run a TV commercial with Dawkins saying
these things for 21 straight seconds. We ended it with the
kicker, `Come on, Pete, be real.' We took a poll afterwards
and he was gone. I mean, you could stick a fork through him
and he was done."
   Mr. Carville likes lap-top computers. He stuffs them full
of data about his own candidate, about the opponent and
anything else he can think of. In New Jersey, he sent his
right-hand man, Paul Begala, off to Mr. Dawkins' news
conferences. At one of them, Mr. Dawkins charged Sen.
Lautenberg was ducking a debate.
   Mr. Begala searched through his little Zenith and came up
with a letter Sen. Lautenberg had already sent to Mr. Dawkins
asking for a debate. Mr. Begala printed out copies of the
letter and hand-delivered them to reporters. Before the news
conference was over, they were on their feet, asking such
questions as, "But, Mr. Dawkins, didn't Sen. Lautenberg
challenge you to a debate several months ago and you failed
to respond?"
   All that was easy pickings compared to this year's race
here in Georgia, where Mr. Carville is up against Mr. Greer,
another of the new breed of consultants. Mr. Greer helped
make Virginia's Douglas Wilder the nation's first elected
black governor last year; if he gets his way, former Mayor
Young will be the second.
   Mr. Greer got his start in politics as press secretary in
Fred Harris' quixotic presidential campaign in 1972. He's
more idealistic than Mr. Carville about what he does. "I
believe deeply in the democratic process," he says. But he
also believes in counterpunching. "The best way to deal with
negative advertising is to make it an issue,"he says. "Stand
up and fight. You must make those who use it pay a price."
   Last year in Virginia, Mr. Greer and his candidate, Mr.
Wilder, were opposed by wily veteran Republican operative
Robert Goodman and his candidate, Marshall Coleman, winner of
an especially nasty GOP primary. Mr. Goodman struck hard with
a 30-second spot charging that Mr. Wilder, as a member of the
state senate, voted against a bill calling for the death
penalty for killing a police officer. Mr. Greer, who had
anticipated the attack, had his response ready to go -- but
had to wait impatiently for another 24 hours to give the
Coleman attack time to register with the voters.
   Then he struck back with an ad that intoned: "Marshall
Coleman has launched another vicious negative ad campaign of
distortion and false facts. This time, he won't get away with
it. The fact is, Doug Wilder supports the death penalty for
the killing of a police officer."
   Actually, the Goodman ad was accurate: Mr. Wilder had
voted against such a bill 12 years earlier. "They were trying
to suggest the guy still opposes the death penalty for
killing police officers," says Mr. Greer. "That's wrong." In
the welter of charge and countercharge, Mr. Goodman never
said the vote was 12 years old and Mr. Greer never admitted
Mr. Wilder had changed his mind.
   "I've got to hand it" to Mr. Greer, says Mr. Goodman.
"That's fast turnaround. He's got an interesting technique.
He doesn't answer the ad. What he does is call you a liar.
It's very effective."

   AMA: Beware Evils
   Of Bureaucrat Control

   Regarding Tim W. Ferguson's April 10 Business World
column, "AMA Sounding a Clear Note, but Its Tune Has
Changed," about the new acting top AMA executive, Dr. James
Todd:
   During its 1964-65 campaign against Medicare, the "old"
AMA predicted that certain consequences would result from
federal involvement in medicine: excess demand, soaring
prices, deterioration of the doctor-patient relationship to
the middle and upper classes. Although proponents of Medicare
ridiculed these predictions at the time, ensuing events have
proved that all of them were accurate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the old AMA did not predict the moral corruption among
physicians themselves -- the breaking of a class of
independent people to the bureaucratic yoke. Yet, in large
part that too must be counted as an "accomplishment" of
federal medicine.
   A class of people under bureaucratic control often
produces more overseers than leaders. When the officers of
the new AMA propose to cure evils wrought by government with
yet more government, they must speak primarily for those
physicians who have lost the self-respect to which their
profession entitles them. It would be better if the AMA would
speak the truth most others are avoiding -- that the federal
entry into medicine (quite apart from its dubious
constitutionality) has been a fiscal and policy disaster.
Federal involvement in medicine does not need to be expanded,
it needs to be reversed.

   ---
   Mr. Ferguson's description of Dr. Todd reveals a man who
has failed to learn the lessons of the results of decades of
the British National Health Service, the Canadian National
Health Service and other forms of government-allocated care.
   According to the College of Health's latest Guide to
Hospital Waiting Lists, in the U.K. there are more than a
million people waiting to be admitted to a hospital, and more
than a quarter of them have been waiting more than a year.
Similar problems are plaguing the Canadian system. Treatments
requiring advanced medical technologies are generally more
difficult to obtain in these nationalized medical programs,
especially if you are elderly. For example, CAT scanners are
available at a far smaller percentage of Canadian hospitals
than U.S. hospitals of a comparable size. Often, individuals
requiring a CAT scan (generally used in the diagnosis of
serious conditions) have to be placed on a waiting list.
   It is no coincidence that, in Soviet-bloc countries,
people have to wait on long lines to get health care, housing
and automobiles, as well as food, and that in Western nations
people have to wait on long lines to get "free" government
health care. In all these cases, the results are due to
centralized control of production and distribution. Why are
so many people eager to copy the failed economics of the
Soviet bloc in the area of health care?

   Medicine:
   Wellcome Halts
   Six-Year Effort
   On Heart Drug

   LONDON -- Wellcome PLC halted work on TPA after six years
of costly research, a setback that may spur sales for
Genentech Inc.'s flagship version of the clot-dissolving
drug.
   At the same time, the major British pharmaceutical maker
said it will accelerate development of Wellferon, its form of
the drug interferon, by expanding production and seeking
wider approval for the medicine's use in treating hepatitis.
Some analysts praised Wellcome's strategic shift, noting that
interferon has greater long-term sales potential than TPA
might have had in a market already clogged with competitors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wellcome said it decided to discontinue development of TPA
after losing a U.S. patent infringement suit brought by
Genentech, a South San Francisco company that has agreed to a
merger plan that would give a majority stake to Roche Holding
Ltd. of Switzerland. Last month, a federal district court
jury in Delaware found that Wellcome and Genetics Institute
Inc., its U.S. collaborator, had infringed on three Genentech
patents by trying to develop forms of TPA. Wellcome
previously had won a U.K. patent case involving the drug,
used during heart attacks to restore blood flow and thus
limit damage.
   The prospect of a protracted U.S. appeal made it
"difficult if not impossible to say what the (drug's) market
potential would be in the United States," where Wellcome had
sought initial marketing approval in March, said Martin
Sherwood, a Wellcome spokesman. He said the company had
invested "a substantial sum of money" in developing TPA --
analysts estimated as much as $80 million -- but the legal
tangle "put us into a high-risk area." He added: "There's no
doubt that (the withdrawal) is a disappointment to us."
   Wellcome also cited recent studies "suggesting that TPA
does not have a markedly superior therapeutic profile to the
established product streptokinase." A study released in March
concluded that Hoechst AG's streptokinase prolongs life as
well as Genentech's flagship TPA product, sold under the
brand name Activase, even though it costs only about
one-tenth as much as TPA. Genentech criticized the study, the
first head-to-head comparison between the two drugs, as
confusing and inconclusive.
   Wellcome's decision will sharpen the fierce competition
between Genentech's Activase and Eminase, a recently approved
drug made by SmithKline Beecham PLC of Britain. Genentech,
whose TPA sales last year rose 30% to $196.4 million, holds
about two-thirds of the market, but SmithKline Beecham is
marketing Eminase aggressively.
   Wellcome's withdrawal "will benefit both (Genentech and
SmithKline Beecham) because there will be that much less
competition" in sight, said Erling Refsum, a
pharmaceutical-industry analyst at Nomura Research Institute
in London. A SmithKline Beecham spokesman declined to comment
on the Wellcome action.
   Wellcome's abandonment of TPA also may convince other drug
companies also to relinquish development of their versions,
Mr. Refsum said. "It will restrict the development of further
TPAs but enhance the development of other bio-technology
drugs" because Genentech's court victory demonstrated these
medicines' patents may withstand legal challenges.
   In South San Francisco, the attorney who defended
Genentech's TPA patent position said that Wellcome's
withdrawal from the field prolongs the biotechnology firm's
effective monopoly and discourages future competition.
   "With Wellcome stepping out of the picture, it will leave
Genentech alone in the marketplace for a much longer period,"
said Stephen Raines, Genentech's vice president of
intellectual property. More importantly, he said, "The second
generation product was also dropped. That could certainly
have a chilling effect on other companies looking at second
generation products, if they feel that, after all their
investment, that product could be found to be infringing on
Genentech's patent."
   Wellcome's U.S. collaborator, Genetics Institute,
Cambridge, Mass., said it is seeking to overturn the patent
verdict, but that a ruling on the matter isn't expected
before September. The biotechnology concern said it hasn't
decided whether to continue developing its clot-dissolving
drugs. It said its agreement with Suntory Ltd. of Japan,
which has licensed rights to a related drug in Asia, remains
inplace.
   Genetics Institute said it expects its 1990 revenue to be
cut by up to $5 million because of Wellcome's decision. For
1989, Genetics Institute had a net loss of $28.7 million, or
$2.11 a share, on revenue of $43.6 million.
   Mr. Refsum and other analysts said Wellcome was smart to
switch research emphasis on genetically engineered drugs from
TPA to Wellferon, which mainly has been marketed for minor
indications such as hairy cell leukemia. The interferon
appears useful in treating hepatitis B, the viral infection's
most serious form. It is "one of their major products in
R&amp;D," said Andrew Porter, a London analyst for Nikko
Securities Co. But unlike Wellcome's leading AIDS drug, AZT,
he said, "Wellferon will be a useful but not spectacular
contributor to Wellcome."
   Wellcome's Mr. Sherwood said Italy recently cleared
Wellferon for use in treating hepatitis B and "initial
indications are that sales are going to be good there."
Within a few months, Wellcome expects to gain marketing
clearance in Spain and Southeast Asia. He said the company
views those areas "as large potential markets" because
hepatitis is so widespread there.

   DEMOCRATS DISPUTE their leaders' push for a budget summit
with Bush.
   House Democrats are particularly outspoken about Speaker
Foley's eagerness for the bipartisan talks. White House talk
about Bush's unchanged no-new-taxes stance fuels the unrest.
Many Democrats want Bush to give his ideas first. "The
starting line has yet to be crossed because the president has
not made any statement of what he wants," says New Jersey
Sen. Bradley.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New York Rep. Schumer says House leaders are
"appropriately cautious of the potential political trap." But
Senate Budget Chairman Sasser warns that with all of the
lawmakers "negotiating with what is essentially one person,
the president, he always has the upper hand." Democrats say
they have little choice but to go ahead now.
   "Everything's on the table, but I guess the question is
who is going to serve?" says Congressional Budget Office
Director Bob Reischauer.
                                                                                                       

   A BUDGET COMPROMISE nears to head off sharp defense
personnel cuts.
   Breaking months of stalemate, the Pentagon and
congressional leaders move toward switching about $800
million to personnel from defense procurement and operating
accounts. The money is needed to avoid freezing military
promotions and laying off as many as 60,000 civilian workers.
Defense officials see the expected compromise as a victory
for Cheney.
   But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Aspin also
would succeed in spreading cuts over more defense programs.
And lawmakers eventually seem sure to cut uniformed personnel
more deeply than Cheney has proposed. Even top Pentagon
planners now concede that the Army and Air Force are likely
to be 25% smaller by 1996.
                                                                                                       

   ALARM GROWS among Bush advisers about Soviet uncertainties
on arms talks.
   The Soviets are vague on issues that Bush wants closer to
settlement by the May 30 summit. Even getting approval for a
final summit schedule is hard. One worry: Gorbachev may be
unwilling to compromise until after his party congress July
2. "We're not sure what's going on over there," says a top
administration Soviet expert.
   Baker will try to break the logjam by carrying "new ideas"
to Moscow next week. These are expected to include
unspecified suggestions on sea-launched cruise missiles. The
U.S. wants these largely excluded from the treaty. The
Soviets have back-tracked and are pressing for tougher limits
on numbers and range.
   Baker came away from last week's meeting with Shevardnadze
frustrated at the Soviets' ambiguous positions.
                                                                                                       

   CANDID COMMENTS by Shevardnadze in a speech surprise U.S.
officials. He told his foreign ministry staff that the Soviet
Union isn't truly a great power because by "praying unduly
assiduously to the idols of pseudo-ideology, we made our
people, the whole country, destitute." He added that he and
other leaders are under attack.
                                                                                                       

   BUDGET BANTER: Senate Budget Chairman Sasser boasted that
the White House urged a budget summit after "they saw the
horse was about to get out of the barn before they got it
bridled." At the Kentucky Derby, he met Budget Chief Darman,
who needled: "Now I know where you get your metaphors." But
Sasser got the last laugh: He won $118 on a $10 bet on
Unbridled, the long-shot winner.
                                                                                                       

   THE "BUBBA VOTE" is courted by Texas Democrat Ann Richards
in her gubernatorial race against GOP oilman-rancher Clayton
("I am Bubba") Williams. She helps roast Port Arthur native
and Oklahoma basketball coach Billy Tubbs, will talk to
independent oil producers in Midland and attend the Cattle
Barons Ball in Tyler.
                                                                                                       

   TAKEN FOR GRANITE? Quayle roils the waters in New
Hampshire's GOP Senate primary by vowing to attend a
fund-raiser May 22 for Rep. Robert Smith. If Smith wins the
Senate seat, he would probably be the state's senior
Republican during the 1996 presidential primary and a key
ally if Quayle seeks the presidency then.
                                                                                                       

   DIVISIVE ISSUES slow the flow of Supreme Court decisions.
   Though the justices have heard the fewest argued cases in
20 years, they still have more than 60 rulings before the
term ends in June. The deliberate pace suggests disagreements
that are delaying decisions. Topping the list: two cases
involving parental notification for minors' abortions; both
sides of the abortion debate are already gearing up
responses.
   The court also is expected to rule on the "right-to-die"
issue of whether a state may require that persons in comatose
conditions be kept alive. Another case involves a federal law
that requires equal access in public schools for religious
clubs. And a ruling is likely on the issue of affirmative
action in awarding federal broadcast licenses.
   Another hot item: A possible reprise of last June's 5-to-4
decision that flagburning is a protected form of protest.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Mixing mom and politics, the conservative
Family Research Council declares that "Mother's Day is not
Child Care Provider's Day." . . . Unlikely fan club: The
Soviet Literary Gazette praises Bush's Chief of Staff Sununu
as "a remarkable phenomenon in American political life . . .
a brilliant organizer . . . emphatically in agreement with
the pragmatic president." . . . Mocking his King Richard
nickname, SEC Chairman Breeden explains his lateness for a
speech saying he had "trouble parking the carriage and
horses."

   Honda Gets
   New Driver
   For the '90s

   TOKYO -- Honda Motor Co., the upstart auto maker that made
success look easy during the 1980s, named its former head of
research and development, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, to lead the
company into the turbulent climate of the 1990s.
   Mr. Kawamoto, 54 years old, won a two-man race with a
senior managing director, Shoichiro Irimajiri, to succeed
Tadashi Kume, 58, who has been at Honda's helm since 1983.
Mr. Kume said he decided to step aside to an emeritus role as
director and advisor to allow a "new generation" to take over
in "a new era." His move is also in line with Honda's
tradition of executives retiring in their late 50s. Mr.
Kawamoto will become Honda's fourth president and the first
not to have been trained directly by company founder Soichiro
Honda.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some insiders had thought that Mr. Irimajiri, who made his
mark as head of Honda's highly successful U.S. manufacturing
operations during the mid-1980s, would get the top job.
Instead, Mr. Irimajiri will become one of two executive vice
presidents and a representative director. He will be in
charge of world-wide production and research and development.
   The other executive vice president is Yoshihide Munekuni,
who will be in charge of sales and marketing. Mr. Munekuni,
currently a senior managing director, is also head of Honda
operations in North America, a post he's held since last
year.
   In addition, Honda named Koichiro Yoshizawa, 58, as
chairman, a post in which he will act as an advisor to the
new management. Mr. Yoshizawa, currently executive vice
president, finance, marketing and sales, was considered the
No. 2 man under Mr. Kume.
   Mr. Kawamoto, who takes over on June 28, said in a short
speech that he and Messrs. Irimajiri and Munekuni will "make
a formidable team, mutually fostering our strengths toward
moving Honda into the future." A company spokesman in the
U.S. described the three as a "triumvirate."
   Honda's corporate culture does emphasize teamwork. The
executive suite in Honda's Tokyo headquarters is an open
room, and the company has a history of being managed by two
strong top executives. But a three-man executive team is a
first for the company, analysts said.
   Mr. Kawamoto and his team will inherit the challenge of
improving on Honda's phenomenal success of the past decade at
a time when competition in the major auto markets of the
world, particularly in the U.S., is more intense than at any
time since World War II.
   "I don't think that every Japanese manufacturer that
builds cars in the U.S. will pass the test," Mr. Kawamoto
observed in an interview last fall. "Not everyone will go up
and up."
   So far, Honda continues to do well in the U.S., its
largest market. The company is closing in on its goal of
outselling No. 3 U.S. auto maker Chrysler Corp. in the
passenger-car market. The Honda Accord was the best-selling
car in the U.S. last year and has a strong chance to repeat
this year. A second U.S. car assembly plant recently started
producing Civic models.
   This fall, Honda will launch its first model designed in
the U.S., the Accord station wagon. That car is important
because it could help capture families who want a minivan or
a midsized wagon, but have had to go elsewhere because Honda
doesn't offer such vehicles. Honda also is expected to unveil
this fall a redesigned version of its Acura Legend luxury
sedan and a new two-seat sports car, the Acura NS-X, designed
to be a limited-edition flagship model selling for $50,000 or
more.
   But these advances aren't coming easily.
   For the nine months ended Dec. 31, 1989, Honda's
consolidated net income fell 24.4% from a year earlier,
despite increased sales in Japan and abroad. Honda has
recently started picking up market share in Japan, but it
still lacks the clout and financial muscle of archrivals
Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co.
   Toyota once trailed Honda in U.S. car sales. But through
April, Toyota has sold more cars in the U.S. than Honda or
Chrysler. And the Big Three U.S. auto makers also are taking
aim at Honda after watching the relatively small company grab
not only market share but leadership in product design and
quality.
   Mr. Kawamoto acknowledged last fall that Honda faces major
external and internal challenges.
   "We have been a trend setter among Japanese auto makers.
Others have been following," he said. "But now the pace of
following is becoming much quicker."
   What's more, Honda's rapid growth during the 1980s has
created a problem unheard of during the company's
entrepreneurial scuffling days: bureaucracy. "We are becoming
a little stiff," Mr. Kawamoto worried. "We are trying to
reorganize to keep our flexibility."
   Mr. Kawamoto's rise at Honda mirrors that of his
predecessor, Mr. Kume, and places him squarely in the
tradition of the engineer-executive who founded the company.
In 1970, Mr. Kawamoto became chief engineer at Honda R&amp;D Co.,
the auto maker's research and development operation. By 1976,
he was the R&amp;D arm's director, and in 1986 he became its
president. Mr. Kume followed virtually the same path during
the 1960s and 1970s.
   Early in his career, Mr. Kawamoto distinguished himself
with his work on the CVCC engine -- the first engine of any
maker to meet U.S. clean-air standards and the breakthrough
that put Honda on the map in the U.S.
   Mr. Kawamoto, who still likes to draw engines at home in
his free time and is an avid collector of vintage sports
cars, also pioneered Honda's re-entry into the Formula One
Grand Prix auto-racing program during the 1980s. Far more
than a marketing effort, Honda uses racing as both a training
ground for engineers and a testing arena for new technology
aimed at mass-market vehicles.
   "Honda has always emphasized innovation and products,"
says Neil Doying, an auto analyst at Baring Securities
(Japan) Ltd. "Keeping with the engineering tradition should
be good for the company."

   NEW YORK -- Dow Jones &amp; Co. named Carl M. Valenti, 51
years old, to the additional post of president of the
Telerate Inc. financial information-service subsidiary.
   Mr. Valenti retains his position as senior vice president
of the parent. At the same time, Dow Jones said, John D.
Jessop, 47-year-old senior executive vice president of
Telerate, resigned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We regret" the resignation, a Dow Jones spokesman said,
"but it's not uncommon after a merger, and with greater
parent-company involvement in operations, for a dedicated and
responsible executive to leave." Dow Jones closed the
acquisition of Telerate in January.
   The resignation "doesn't reflect any difference in
fundamental priorities, plans and business objectives at
Telerate and Dow Jones," the spokesman said. He added,
however, that the resignation was unexpected.
   Mr. Jessop, who was named to his current post effective
March 1, declined to comment.
   Mr. Valenti has had overall responsibility for the
direction of both Telerate and Dow Jones's Information
Services group, of which he remains president and publisher.
Dow Jones said he will press ahead with projects in progress
to further strengthen the position of the parent and
subsidiary in the electronic-information field.
   Dow Jones also publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's
magazine, and community newspapers.

   WHO's to Blame: Fixing World Health Aid

   Delegates attending the annual assembly of World Health
Organization today have a rare and remarkable opportunity to
make a difference to the poor. Yet it will be a frustrating
task. The seemingly straightforward path that connects WHO to
the compelling health needs of the poorest countries makes a
wide detour. That detour is through myriad programs,
meetings, and activities, all aimed at pursuing WHO's
open-ended definition of health as complete physical, social
and mental well-being for all. With 22 different functions in
its constitution, ranging from scientific cooperation to
public opinion, WHO has the option to be involved in any
international issue from bugs to bombs. And it has exercised
that option.
   In 1990, WHO has budgeted resources for 356 technical
activities. But many of these resources are allocated to
their administration. For example, nearly half of WHO's
regional efforts are consumed by organizing and
administrating. By one calculation of staff time spent in
Africa, 4% of that time is spent on disease prevention, 4% on
human-resource development and 65% on administration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 1990-91 WHO budget totals $1.4 billion, but because of
a bias toward global and regional programs, funds that can be
spent at the country level are a tiny portion of the total
budget. The monies allocated to country-level activities in
the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa amount to only 7.9% and
7.3%, respectively, of the total budget. South and East Asia,
which include such desperately poor countries as Bangladesh
and Nepal, receive only 5.6% of the total funds. The nations
of the Western Pacific, including such poor countries as
Kiribati and Vanuatu, receive only 3.4% of the total budget.
   Resources trickling down to the countries most in need
have at times become a ludicrously small portion of WHO
expenditures. For example, WHO is spending less than
one-tenth of one percent of its $1.4 billion budget on
malaria control programs in Africa. Funding for
accident-prevention programs in the 34 countries of the
Western Pacific amounts to only $5,000 per year, or $147 per
country. The budget for programs to ensure drug and vaccine
safety and efficacy in Africa is merely $6,000. This amount
is budgeted for 46 nations for two years and translates into
$65 per country per year.
   In the countries of Southeast Asia, WHO's budget to
confront the leading killer of children, acute respiratory
infections, is just $500,000 over the next two years.
Estimates place the number of Southeast Asian children
between the ages of one and four at 34 million in 1990. This
means that WHO can contribute less than a penny per child to
fight the prime childhood killer in Southeast Asia.
   Not only are the portions of the budget allocated to
country activities in the poorest countries meager, but in
addition, the poorest countries did not receive any real
budget increases in 1990-91 compared to the 1988-89 period.
Yet, every single European nation received a real increase.
   It is true that the European nations receive a small
proportion of total resources and that their allotment is
tiny on a per capita basis. Yet, it amounts to $50 million of
WHO's scarce resources. If applied to country-level programs,
this amount could nearly double the regular budget
allocations for Africa. One might question not only the
critical need but also the relative ability of Europeans to
finance their own health-care programs. On average, European
governments spend $642 per person on health care, compared to
about $9 per capital in the low-income countries.
   Layers of bureaucracy have clouded what should be clear
priorities for WHO. Many activities have absolutely no
relevance to the people with the greatest needs. For
instance, of what possible relevance to people in needy
countries such as Ethiopia or Bhutan is the development of
essential drug lists for civilian aircraft in flight?
Incomprehensibly, the budget shows that the poorest countries
with the greatest health problems receive less support from
WHO than some of the more wealthy ones. Africa, for example,
receives only 16% of WHO's budget from all sources.
   Ethiopia, the poorest country in the world, has been
allocated 10 cents per person for 1990-91 (combining the
regular budget with other sources), or the princely sum of 5
cents per person per year. Bangladesh, Tanzania and
Mozambique are in much the same boat. Indeed, for the poorest
nations, the annual per-capita country allocation hardly ever
exceeds 25 cents. Yet, WHO provides twice as many
country-level resources per capita to Saudi Arabia and
Singapore as it does to Ethiopia.
   The problems of the poorest countries are not considered
in program design. Seventy-five percent of the African
countries could find use only for five of the 50 different
programs offered by WHO. Ironically, the most frequently
requested program for Africa, human resource development, was
the only one to receive a budget cut.
   WHO has chosen to emphasize its role of international
interlocutor for all manner of health concerns. But WHO must
reevaluate its mission. The existing WHO charter provides the
organization with the authority to shift and narrow its
focus. It should respond to the challenges of today in a
straightforward priority fashion that will expand its
effectiveness.
   Second, in shifting its focus, WHO must turn to the
neediest. Stretching its resources across all its members has
limited the funds available to improve the grave health
problems of the poorest. Perhaps it is time to declare Europe
re-built and apply its $50 million allocation to Africa.
   Third, WHO staff must peel away the levels of bureaucracy
and get closer to the members. By allocating resources among
the poorest countries and relocating technical personnel to
the field, WHO may learn what the real needs are. Action
should take place in the countries, not at WHO headquarters
in Geneva.
   Last, let demand determine supply. Defining the specific
activities of WHO should be the job of the membership, the
ministers of health and finance from developing countries,
not the Geneva Secretariat, international activists or
influential European countries. WHO should also take the
unprecedented step of eliminating programs that no country
wants.
   Delegates to the World Health Assembly should insist that
the next two-year WHO budget be designed to bridge the
health-care chasm between the rich and poor nations of the
world. Surely WHO delegates can break down the layers of
bureaucracy and the manifold interests that have constrained
the organization's potential to do the most good.

   Swiss Franc, Bolstered by High Rates,
   Strengthens Against Dollar, Other Units

   NEW YORK -- The Swiss franc rose against the dollar,
pulling the mark up with it, while profit-taking steadied the
U.S. unit against most other currencies after sharp losses
Wednesday.
   Large-scale selling of yen for Swiss francs helped the
dollar post modest gains against the yen, traders said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Swiss unit, which was extending recent gains, remains
in strong demand because of high Swiss interest rates,
dealers said.
   The currency also is benefiting from a market perception
of Switzerland as an economically and politically stable
country in which to invest. This perception is helping
Switzerland draw a healthy portion of the capital that
currently is flowing into Europe from the U.S., said Judy
Rubenstein, a vice president and trader at Bank of America in
Los Angeles.
   The Swiss unit is getting further support from Japanese
borrowers who need the currency to pay off maturing
franc-denominated bonds, Ms. Rubenstein and other
participants said.
   Traders said that Japanese buying of the Swiss unit late
last month brought the franc out of the obscurity it had
suffered while the market focused on German unification.
However, the franc's original upward pressure against the yen
was broadened by a high-profile campaign conducted by the
Swiss National Bank on behalf of the currency, they added.
   The franc ended the New York day at 112.63 yen, up a full
yen from 111.63 yen late Wednesday in New York.
   The Swiss National Bank, which sets the Swiss Lombard
interest rate, has said repeatedly it will take whatever
measures are necessary to keep the franc strong, a policy
that has included maintaining comparatively high interest
rates.
   The Swiss National Bank's Lombard rate stood yesterday at
10.875%, unchanged from its level Wednesday.
   The mark also weakened against the Swiss franc, falling to
0.8524 franc from 0.8567 franc in trading late Wednesday in
New York. However, the franc and mark tend to move in a
roughly parallel direction against the dollar, so some of the
Swiss franc's gains against the U.S. unit spilled over to the
German currency. Sterling fell to 2.3342 francs from 2.3533
francs.
   While the dollar rebounded slightly against most
currencies yesterday on some buying of the U.S. unit at its
lower levels and modest profit-taking in other currencies,
market sentiment on the U.S. currency remains bearish,
participants said.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6285 marks, down from 1.6360 marks late Wednesday, and
at 156.70 yen, up from 156.50 yen late Wednesday. Sterling
was quoted at $1.6795, up from $1.6785 Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 154.80 yen, down sharply from Thursday's Tokyo
close of 156.75 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at
about 1.6300 marks.
   Market worry is focused on the possibility of lower
interest rates following Friday's disappointing employment
report for April, a concern that has been sharpened by
renewed efforts by President Bush and Congress to reduce the
federal budget deficit. It's feared that a lower deficit will
lead to pressure for lower interest rates.
   News that the Treasury's $10 billion of 30-year bonds sold
at an average yield of 8.84% came too late in the day to
influence trading.
   Bearishness about the U.S. currency is such that
participants are willing to sell the U.S. unit at the
smallest opportunity. This was seen late in the day when
traders sold the dollar against the mark following a gain by
the Swiss franc against the U.S. currency, said Francoise
Soares-Kemp, treasury vice president at Credit Suisse in New
York.
   "There's a contagion of anti-dollar feeling," in the
market, Ms. Soares-Kemp said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $370.10 an ounce, down $1.80. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.8 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $371.55 an ounce.

   Agonizing Choices:
   Medical Advances in Fighting Heart Disease Have Forced
   The Patient to Make Difficult Decisions About Treatment

   FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS now the nation's greatest killer
has been giving ground, grudgingly at first but now with
increasing speed, before an onslaught by modern medicine and
technology. But this very success has bred a problem all its
own, a problem of alternatives.
   The killer is coronary-artery disease, which still takes a
half-million lives annually, and the problem is this: With
every refinement and new advance in its treatment, doctors
and patients alike now have choices they never had before --
agonizing ones. The result has been increasing tension over
treatment options, particularly between cardiologists and
surgeons, and more anxiety and doctor-shopping among patients
whose lives depend on making the right decision.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Granted, this is not the worst problem they could have.
Nobody would want to go back to, say, the mid-60s, when a
diagnosis of substantial artery disease was, as one physician
puts it, "tantamount to a death sentence." Little could be
done. The patient might die tomorrow, next month, next year,
10 years from now -- but he would die early unless something
else killed him even earlier.
   Since then, millions of lives have been saved and greatly
extended by the principal developments of the past couple of
decades: cardiac bypass surgery, angioplasty, and new drug
regimens. But though these are impressive statistics, heart
disease is not about statistics. It is about the individual
patient and his doctor groping for answers to two universal
questions:
   What is the best way to treat this particular case? What
should I do to save my life?
   ---
   In Hanover, N.H., the operating room at
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center resonates with the harsh
buzz of a hand-held jigsaw as cardiac surgeon Stephen Plume
cuts open the chest of a 67-year-old man. Soon, three clear
plastic tubes connecting the patient's heart to a nearby
heart-lung machine turn a deep crimson; the patient's blood
is now being pumped from outside his body. Moments later, a
technician turns a valve sending a potassium-based solution
directly to the heart. It stops cold.
   This is coronary-artery bypass graft surgery, in which a
vein from another part of the patient's body will be used to
create an alternative route around fat-clogged portions of
his coronary arteries. Untreated, the arteries would clog
completely or get plugged by a blood clot, triggering a heart
attack.
   Bypass surgery is the ultimate, most invasive and -- to
patients --  the most frightening of all treatments for
coronary-artery disease. For almost 15 years after its
inception in 1968, it was also the only one available to
severe cases. Their choice was simple then: Have the surgery
or die.
   That changed a decade ago with the advent of angioplasty,
a safer and less invasive procedure (but in some ways a less
effective one). With angioplasty, a needle-thin catheter is
threaded into the heart's arteries and a balloon at its tip
is inflated, squashing the fatty deposits flat against the
artery walls and allowing a freer flow of blood through them.
Suddenly, there were two choices on the treatment menu.
   And all along new drugs were being developed, and new uses
for old ones found. Today, 65% of newly diagnosed cases of
coronary disease are initially treated by drugs, and for a
good many of them drugs remain the only therapy prescribed.
   No heart drug clears obstructions from blood vessels. But
the beta-blocker compounds reduce the heart's workload, and
hence its need for oxygen that the diseased arteries can't
deliver. The calcium-channel antagonists keep narrowed
arteries from closing due to spasms, and simple aspirin is
now widely prescribed to prevent blood clots.
   Of course, for many patients, choosing among the three
treatment options -- surgery, angioplasty or drugs -- is
premature. The first thing doctors should do, says Eugene
Passamani, director of heart and vascular diseases at the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, is demand that
their patients reduce their heart-attack risk by changing
their behavior: Quit smoking, reduce weight, and lower blood
pressure and cholesterol levels. "Smokers have to be
admonished to stop smoking," says Dr. Passamani. "The data
are incontrovertible."
   But experienced cardiologists say they often know just by
talking to their patients that some treatment is needed.
"Patients take their fist and put it against their chest,"
says Gerald Weisfogel, a Metuchen, N.J., heart doctor. "When
they use that description, it really sets off bells. It's
classic angina" -- pain caused when clogged arteries block
blood flow to the heart.
   Prescribing treatment, however, is another matter. "At the
extremes, it's very easy," Dr. Passamani says. "A severely
diseased left main artery {which feeds the left ventricle,
the heart's pumping chamber} goes right to bypass. Mild
angina can be treated with medicine."
   That leaves a lot in between for doctors to disagree about
-- and a lot for patients to be confused about. Thomas Noto,
a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Florida, in Fort
Lauderdale, says: "When you show a surgeon a case of
significant coronary disease, there's only one cure for it:
surgery. When you show it to a cardiologist, there's only one
cure for it: angioplasty."
   Dr. Noto is admittedly exaggerating to make a point --
that surgeons like to cut, that cardiologists like to avoid
cutting, and that these ingrained biases sometimes affect
decision-making. A cardiologist he knows had a 42-year-old
male patient with blockage in three arteries -- making him,
says Dr. Noto, clearly a case for bypass. The cardiologist
sold him on angioplasty instead. While it was being done, the
patient went into shock and his heart muscle was damaged
before an emergency bypass, the backup procedure, could be
completed.
   "The patient's whole life expectancy was reduced," says
Dr. Noto. "This wasn't a malpractice thing, but it certainly
was bad judgment."
   As for patients, it's not surprising that when given a
choice, almost all will select angioplasty over bypass. In
the balloon technique, patients are sedated and awake rather
than anesthetized, they are not being torn open by surgical
saws, and they're in the hospital for just a day or two and
can return to work within five days. Only about 1% of
patients die during the procedure or soon after.
   By contrast, bypass patients generally spend 10 days or
more in the hospital and three months recuperating. Their
death rate is 2% at medical centers where surgical teams do a
large number of such operations, and can be far higher where
they don't. The cost is higher, too -- an average of $22,771,
against $9,138 for angioplasty, according to a study done at
Emory University in Atlanta.
   But there are hidden hazards and other drawbacks to
angioplasty. In 3% to 7% of cases, the vessel stretched open
by the balloon collapses spontaneously and a bypass has to be
done anyway, either immediately or promptly. (For this
reason, doctors say it is imperative that angioplasty be done
only in hospitals where heart surgeons are on standby.)
   Finally, in 30% of cases the arteries treated clog again
within six months. Only 10 weeks after his angioplasty,
Walter Hermann, a 43-year-old AT&amp;T employee from Piscataway,
N.J., felt a tightness in his chest while he was walking. "I
knew it had closed," he says. He had angioplasty again, with
the vessels opened wider than before, and has been free of
symptoms for two years though he jogs five miles a day.
   It isn't unusual to perform the balloon treatment even a
third time, but that's about the limit. Says cardiologist
Geoffrey Hartzler of the Mid-America Heart Institute in
Kansas City: "It isn't sane to do it every three or four
months. The time comes for surgery rather than keep flogging
it with the balloon."
   Surgeons, he adds, argue that with the high rate of
recurrence a bypass might as well be done in the first place.
Though the grafted vessels in that procedure often clog up,
too, the process generally takes years rather than a few
months.
   But variations on angioplasty are now being tested,
variations that promise to make the procedure longer-lasting.
They include tiny lasers that vaporize the fatty deposits
instead of just flattening them out, roto-rooter devices that
shave them away, and stents -- springy mesh coils that, left
inside the diseased artery by the angioplasty catheter,
expand against the artery walls to keep them open.
   This will certainly improve the therapy, but it will also
make the choices for doctors and patients even more complex.
Currently, there are no firm guidelines doctors can rely on
to determine which patients would be best served by which
treatment; studies are under way, but results are years off.
   Even experienced physicians find that treating heart
disease is often more art than science. "No two patients are
alike," says Charles Bush, director of the cardiac
catheterization laboratory at Ohio State University
Hospitals, Columbus. "What happens to their father or their
uncle or their neighbor isn't what's going to happen to them,
even if it sounds like exactly the same thing. That's what
makes this business very difficult."
   Fearing bypass even though their cases call for it, many
patients have to be talked out of angioplasty. When the
patient is elderly, the issue may be whether either procedure
is worth doing. Dr. Noto, the cardiologist from Fort
Lauderdale, says that the risk and the cost of bypass and
angioplasty often outweigh the benefits that, say, a
79-year-old might get. He believes many patients that age
should be treated with nothing but medication.
   "I spend as much time talking people out of getting
invaded as I do invading them," he says. "We're using up
resources with no regard whatever to their cost." In such
cases, he adds, not only medical judgment but ethical and
moral considerations must be involved in the treatment
decision.
   Such decisions are extraordinarily complex in any case
where the remedy is not clear-cut, as it frequently is not.
This is apparent at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in
Hanover, where cardiologists and heart surgeons meet every
Wednesday for a "cath conference" at which tough cases are
reviewed.
   One Wednesday they are watching films of an angiogram -- a
diagnostic procedure in which dye is injected into the
coronary arteries to reveal their condition -- taken on a
50-year-old saleswoman. Watching the dye course through her
arteries, the doctors see that in some places they are 70% to
90% blocked and look like twisted ribbon, each twist
representing a narrowed passage.
   But this is only one consideration. The doctors in Hanover
also factor into the risk-benefit equation such things as
age, weight, personal habits and health history, existence of
complicating diseases like diabetes, condition of the heart
muscle itself, and more.
   "She continues to smoke, she has high cholesterol, and has
a {negative} family history," a cardiologist reports. The
best he can say for her is that she doesn't have diabetes and
that she's trying to quit smoking. "I don't think she's a
candidate for angioplasty, but she wants something done," he
adds.
   Using a complex risk formula, surgeon Stephen Plume
calculates her risk of death during bypass at 7% to 10% --
far higher than the average 2% and more than he is
comfortable with. He is displeased that she is still smoking.
But she is only 50, and he says he is "uneasy" at ruling her
out. In the end, he puts her down for bypass.
   Another patient is 76, less than five feet tall, and
weighs 240 pounds. Looking at the films, a doctor murmurs,
"The LAD {left anterior descending artery, a critically
important vessel} looks like 10 miles of bad road."
   If she were younger or not obese, a bad LAD would probably
send her to bypass. But as it is, her risk of death on the
table is calculated at a sky-high 26%. "And what do we gain
even if we have a {successful} result at surgery?" one doctor
asks. Dr. Plume says, "We don't want to operate on her." The
cardiologists agree to try to open up her LAD with a balloon.
   These kinds of decisions are being made every week in
countless medical centers. But they are only preliminary
decisions; the patient must agree. And, with growing
frequency, anxious patients are demanding more information
from their doctors and more involvment in the whole process
of weighing treatment options.
   When they are dissatisfied, some of them go
doctor-shopping. Michael Tobin, a 47-year-old lawyer who had
had a bypass 10 years before, discovered last fall that his
arteries had become obstructed again. Told by his doctor that
he needed another bypass, he balked. "Being cut down the
middle of your chest is a big deal," he says. "I was
determined not to go through it again."
   Mr. Tobin personally sent his angiograms to five of the
nation's foremost balloon specialists, hoping at least one
would agree to try angioplasty. "They told me to forget it,"
he says. He looked into laser angioplasty but found that it
was still viewed as experimental.
   Mr. Tobin finally relented -- but only after he got Dudley
Johnson, the Milwaukee surgeon who was a bypass pioneer and
who specializes in difficult cases, to take his case. "Dr.
Johnson said my situation wasn't so complicated," says Mr.
Tobin, who is back at work in New Jersey following successful
surgery. "When he said that, I knew he was the one for me."

   Consumer Credit
   Increased at Rate
   Of 4.4% in March

   WASHINGTON -- Propelled by an increase in retail and
bank-card borrowing, consumer credit grew at a 4.4% annual
rate in March, the Federal Reserve Board reported.
   Consumer debt rose $2.62 billion in March, following a
revised $62 million increase in February, the Fed said. The
February increase was originally reported to be $3.42
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revolving credit, which consists mainly of retail and
bank-card debt, rose $2.02 billion in March, or at an annual
rate of 12.1%. The March increase follows February's
slowdown, when revolving credit rose a revised $786 million,
or at a 4.7% annual rate. The March figures resemble
borrowing activity in January, when revolving credit rose a
revised $2.16 billion.
   The increase in revolving credit is in line with what
Rosiland Wells, chief economist of the National Retail
Merchants Association, said she has been hearing from
retailers.
   "The larger picture is one of expansion in the consumer
area," said Ms. Wells. Although consumers are less confident
about buying and borrowing today then they were a year ago,
Ms. Wells said she hasn't seen any data indicating consumers
are overburdened.
   Automobile loans increased $1.81 billion, or at a 7.5%
annual rate, in March, following a $1.27 billion drop in
February.
   Overall, economists had different interpretations of the
report, which is known for its volatility.
   Joan Schneider, senior domestic economist at Continental
Bank National Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said the report isn't a
valuable measure of total consumer borrowing from month to
month, because home-equity loans aren't included.
   "The revised numbers, showing a small increase, are
probably more in line with other indicators on consumer
spending," Ms. Schneider said. She later added that consumers
are willing to spend and borrow when the price is right.
   However, Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security
Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, said consumer
confidence is declining, and she predicted a decline in
purchases of big-ticket items that require consumer
borrowing. "I think consumer spending is going to slow down
in the second half of this year," Ms. Cooper said.
   At the end of March, outstanding consumer credit stood at
$705.99 billion, compared with $680.73 billion a year
earlier.

   MIAMI -- The TV newsman asks Jorge Mas Canosa a question
that is hotly debated all over this exile capital.
   Is it true, the commentator asks, that Mr. Mas Canosa, a
wealthy 49-year-old telephone-company contractor, plans to
succeed Fidel Castro?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I am not running for president of Cuba," snaps Mr. Mas
Canosa in his heavily accented English. Later, appearing on
local Spanish-language radio, Mr. Mas Canosa, a volatile
fellow who once challenged a Miami city commissioner to a
duel, lashes out at people who would ridicule him for
political ambitions he denies having:
   "The only thing Jorge Mas aspires to is the liberty of
Cuba." (Like some kings and presidents, he has a tendency to
refer to himself in the third person.)
   Until lately, few would have cared one way or the other
about Mr. Mas Canosa's political future, even though the
businessman is also chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, a powerful Washington-based exile lobby, to which
he devotes most of his time. The Castro succession has been
beside the point for the 31 years Fidel has been unassailably
in power. But suddenly, in the bright glare of perestroika,
the 63-year-old Mr. Castro is looking increasingly
vulnerable. If change can come to the Communist bloc in
Eastern Europe, then why not to a Soviet satellite off the
coast of Florida?
   Mr. Castro's overthrow may prove to be just the latest
exile pipe dream but, in Miami at least, the struggle for
power in post-Castro Cuba is going at full tilt.
   And of the many would-be "Senores Presidentes" who live
and scheme in this conspirators' heaven, Mr. Mas Canosa -- a
slight, extraordinarily energetic man with connections in
Washington, not to mention a penchant for hot rhetoric and a
blue, bulletproof Mercedes-Benz -- is widely seen as the most
ambitious of them all.
   "People of my generation don't talk about being president,
they act like the president," says a director of the
foundation, who suggests that Mr. Mas Canosa, despite his
protestations to the contrary, really is after Mr. Castro's
job and is, therefore, trying to act the part. Like many
others interviewed for this story, the director didn't want
to be identified.
   On April 28, Mr. Mas Canosa excoriated Fidel and lavishly
praised Ronald Reagan for 16 minutes before 20,000
flag-waving Cuban exiles gathered at the Orange Bowl to hear
a speech by Mr. Reagan, decked out for the occasion in his
"guayabera", a shirt typical of the Caribbean. "Americans and
Cubans together again will gain the liberty and independence
of Cuba," Mr. Mas Canosa told the excited crowd, in a speech
that was broadcast to Cuba on the U.S. Information Agency's
Radio Marti.
   In the past few months, Mr. Mas Canosa has toured Eastern
Europe, meeting with presidents and prime ministers. He was
accompanied by Armando Valladares, a former Cuban political
prisoner and author, who, though he barely speaks English, is
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission
in Geneva.
   Florida's governor, Bob Martinez, recently named Mr. Mas
Canosa chairman of the state's "Free Cuba" commission, which
is to advise the governor on the economic and social impact
on South Florida of Mr. Castro's prospective fall.
   Mr. Mas Canosa and the foundation have been busy writing a
constitution for a hypothetical Cuban provisional government.
Mr. Mas Canosa says he has hired Nobel laureate economist
Milton Friedman, at a fee of between $100,000 and $150,000,
to draw up plans for the Cuban economy post-Castro. (Mr.
Friedman denies that rather emphatically: "They asked me if I
would be willing to head up the study, and I said no. . . . I
haven't received a penny, nor do I have any expectation of
receiving a penny. . . .")
   In a small broadcast booth crowded with supporters, Mr.
Mas Canosa tells a talk-show audience that Arthur Laffer,
"the guy who invented the Laffer curve," is also on the team.
Mr. Laffer confirms that he is. His mission: to draw up a
list of Fortune 500 companies eager to invest in a free Cuba.
The exiles take it for granted that Cuba after Castro will be
free and that it may well find its new leader in Miami. With
a confident sweep of his arm, Mr. Mas Canosa explains that
Cuba will need little U.S. aid, as he and the foundation have
plans to raise maybe $19 billion in the international bond
market.
   Some anti-Castro exiles accuse Mr. Mas Canosa of
machinations in Washington fostering his presidential
aspirations in Havana. Ernesto Betancourt, the former head of
Radio Marti, says, in particular, that in March Mr. Mas
Canosa cost him his job.
   Mr. Mas Canosa heads President Bush's advisory board on
Radio Marti and is ardent about the new TV Marti operation,
which broadcasts to Cuba. Mr. Betancourt was opposed to the
very idea of it, arguing that Cuba could turn it to its
advantage in its propaganda war with the U.S. by jamming the
signal. And so, Mr. Betancourt says, Mr. Mas Canosa plotted
to have him removed. Actually, Mr. Betancourt was offered a
job transfer that he refused to take. He quit instead.
   He says Mr. Mas Canosa wants to use the broadcast
operation to hype his presidential aspirations with the Cuban
people. Mr. Betancourt believes, he says, that his removal
"was a "coup d'etat" to get control of transmissions, with
Mas being in the background." Mr. Mas Canosa strongly denies
the characterization, and the USIA says its offer of a job
transfer to Mr. Betancourt had nothing to do with Mr. Mas
Canosa.
   In Miami, Mr. Mas Canosa is admired for his relentless
dedication to the anti-Castro cause. But many exiles, and
even some close associates of his, see in Mr. Mas Canosa
authoritarian, anti-democratic impulses. In his radio
appearances, he bitterly attacks opponents, using the same
sort of strident rhetoric -- albeit from the right -- that
Mr. Castro employs to intimidate. Recently, he denounced a
group of university professors in Miami with whom he
disagreed as "close to Castro," despite their weakness for
"McDonald's hamburgers and Burger King."
   One measure of the fear in which Mr. Mas Canosa is held is
that many people who condemn him roundly in private are
unwilling to criticize him on the record. Some people compare
his personality to Mr. Castro's. Raul Masvidal, a founder of
the foundation who quit in 1985, says Mr. Mas Canosa as a
leader is "paternalistic and authoritarian. That's what we
have with Castro."
   Mr. Mas Canosa rejects the comparison. He says that he is
opposed to dictatorships of all sorts and that he has spent
his whole career fighting for democracy. He notes, however,
that when attacked, he is combative.
   Cubans are "absolutists" who consider leaders either weak
or dictatorial, he says. "I am in the middle." And as for the
fear of criticizing the foundation, he admits that some do
think twice before speaking out. "People fear the social
pressure because the foundation has a great deal of respect
in the community."
   At his office desk in a warehouse-district building here,
a fat stack of phone messages has piled up during a two-day
absence. He says he spends about 90% of his time on Cuba, 10%
tending to his business, which specializes in laying
telephone cable for Southern Bell. (He also has a tractor
dealership.) "The main objective of the Cuban government is
to defame the foundation and my person," Mr. Mas Canosa tells
a visitor darkly. "There is a conspiracy against the
foundation and against me."
   Mr. Mas Canosa's power lies in his close control of the
Cuban American National Foundation, which has an associated
though legally distinct lobbying group, and a
political-action committee that in the 1988 election gave
$182,897 to 56 U.S. House and Senate candidates, Democrats as
well as Republicans. The foundation's board is top-heavy with
Miami's newly rich Cuban business elite. "It's a business
oligarchy, which has delegated political decisions to Jorge,"
says Jose Antonio Font, a former executive director of the
foundation.
   The group has more than 50 directors, who each pony up at
least $10,000 a year in order to serve. Trustees, about 40
individuals, pay half that. And in the past three years, to
shed its elitist image the organization has signed up some
6,000 individual members, contributing as little as $5 per
month each.
   The foundation has scored a number of coups in Washington.
It got Radio Marti on the air. Then lobbying by the
foundation was instrumental in lifting a congressional ban on
U.S. aid to Jonas Savimbi's anti-Communist guerrillas, who
were fighting Cuban troops in Angola. The foundation has
brought to the U.S., with the blessings of the Reagan and
Bush administrations, 2,400 Cubans who had been stranded in
third countries. And, in March, TV Marti (whose broadcast
signal Cuba promptly jammed) began its trial run. The
foundation (in other words, Jorge Mas Canosa) powerfully
influences U.S. Cuba policy.
   Mr. Mas Canosa himself left Cuba as a student in 1960. He
trained for the failed, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion but his
boat never reached the beach. He worked as a milkman in Miami
and some customers still remember him today, for his
punctuality and because he was always talking about Cuba.
   Mr. Mas Canosa was commissioned a second lieutenant in the
U.S. Army, but resigned his commission and joined an
anti-Castro group. As the exiles' activity waned, Mr. Mas
Canosa worked at various jobs before establishing himself in
a business career. Ultimately, he bought an electrical
contracting company, which today has about 600 employees and
is a major subcontractor for the local unit of BellSouth
Corp.
   Although Mr. Mas Canosa sometimes affects the image of a
suave Washington mover, he is still in many ways the
prototypical, fiery exile politician with streetfighter
instincts.
   To wit: In 1986, Mr. Mas Canosa in a radio appearance
challenged Miami's city commissioner at the time, Joe
Carollo, to a duel. His choice of weapons: firearms. Mr.
Carollo had torpedoed a $130 million real-estate development
deal involving Mr. Mas Canosa, former U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick and others.
   "I am going to prove to the Cubans that you are a clown
and a coward," Mr. Mas Canosa pledged on the air. "Your
bullying in Miami has ended because you have encountered a
man, with a capital M, a very big M."
   Mr. Carollo replied that Mr. Mas Canosa might cool off if
the duel were held with water pistols. No duel was fought,
but Mr. Mas Canosa believes that his challenge served its
purposes, tarnishing Mr. Carollo's macho image with
Cuban-American supporters. Whatever the truth of that, Mr.
Carollo was defeated in the next election -- by a candidate
backed by foundation directors' money.
   At times, Mr. Mas Canosa seems still to be part of the
secretive world of exile conspiracies. In 1988, for instance,
he told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that leaders of a
rival Cuban exile group were planning to kill him. That
charge was groundless, says Hubert Matos Jr., one of the men
he accused. Mr. Matos says he immediately requested and
passed an FBI polygraph test. "He {Mr. Mas Canosa} had no
reason to go to the FBI," Mr. Matos asserts. "It's a way of
hurting a person's reputation. All he had to do was to call
me on the telephone."
   In 1987, Mr. Mas Canosa received a mysterious manila
envelope in the mail, which a Miami police dog agreed was
suspicious. Mr. Mas Canosa took to the airwaves to say he
suspected that agents of Mr. Castro had sent him a bomb.
(Indeed, another prominent Cuban-American had recently been
sent an explosive device.) The Miami City Commission quickly
offered a $25,000 reward for information. But the bomb squad
eventually defused the effort. The package contained a
videotape, nothing more, no bomb.
   Does Mr. Mas Canosa still feel he is in danger? "Of
course," he says, "When you hurt an assassin like Castro, you
have to be careful."
   Mr. Mas Canosa says that in the matter of the
assassination threat he reported to the FBI, he acted on what
he thought was good and sufficient information. "I have only
one life," he says.
   Over the years, Mr. Mas Canosa has fought a running battle
with the Miami Herald over its coverage of the foundation,
and of Cuban affairs generally. He has considered trying to
start a competing newspaper. In 1987, the foundation took out
a full-page ad in the Herald criticizing the Herald.
   Last year, at the foundation's annual Washington meeting,
there was a discussion about condemning the Herald, or even
of boycotting it. Armando Codina, a director, objected.
Suddenly, Mr. Mas Canosa grabbed the microphone, shouting,
"No more discussions]" Then, according to someone present,
Mr. Mas Canosa moved to condemn the Herald, saying that all
those who agreed should stand up. Everyone stood except Mr.
Codina, who confirms that the incident took place. "I had a
difference of opinion, and it was discussed," says Mr.
Codina.
   Mr. Mas Canosa says a boycott was never suggested and that
while a resolution condemning the Herald was considered, it
did not pass.
   ---
   In Miami, some suspect Mr. Mas Canosa is hoping that blood
will be shed in Cuba and that the U.S. will intervene. At
that point, they believe, Mr. Mas Canosa would maneuver to be
installed president by the force of U.S. arms. "Jorge is
desperately looking for the Marines," says Mr. Masvidal.
   Not so, insists Mr. Mas Canosa. He wants no U.S.
intervention and a nonviolent solution to the Cuban problem.
As he puts it, it doesn't seem to be much of a problem:
"Castro is a dead man," he confidently tells a college class
on leadership. "We are negotiating now what kind of funeral
he will have."

   Officials said the department had overestimated the extent
to which the imports are "dumped" -- that is sold at prices
below those in the home market or the cost of production --
when it first imposed 4.4% duties in 1987. The duties will
drop to 4.16% on some flowers and to 2.24% on others. The
imports -- mostly carnations, chrysanthemums and pompons --
are valued at about $180 million a year.

   Millicom Says It
   Has Yet to Develop
   Prototype of Phone

   NEW YORK -- Millicom Inc. Chairman J. Shelby Bryan said
that while the federal government has licensed the company to
test a new hand-held telephone in the U.S., the company
doesn't have a working version of the phone.
   On Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission
licensed a Millicom subsidiary, PCN America Inc., to
construct and operate on an experimental basis a personal
communications network in Houston and Orlando. The news
pushed Millicom shares up $1 apiece to $20.50 in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, after gaining $1.25 on
Wednesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Millicom already operates a cellular-phone network in
Britain and has been licensed to build a personal network
there by 1992.
   While the company recently distributed a photo showing the
pocket phone that customers of Millicom's personal network
would use, Mr. Bryan said that the device in the photo is
simply a plastic shell containing no electronic parts. Mr.
Bryan emphasized that the system is still in the experimental
stage. But, he said, "I fundamentally believe that PCN will
be the future communications technology."
   Regarding the phone prototype, he said: "We have not
demonstrated it. But the technology definitely works." He
added that a personal-network lab experiment in Britain
worked fine, but he declined to identify any independent
observers of these lab tests. He did offer to provide a
company consultant who could discuss the technology at a
future date, and said that Millicom is negotiating with
several suppliers to manufacture the pocket phone, but he
declined to identify them.
   Millicom's partners in the British personal-network system
are British Aerospace PLC, Matra S.A. of France and Pacific
Telesis Group, the San Francisco regional Bell phone company.
   Mr. Bryan also said that published reports stating that
Millicom would build systems servicing more than 20,000
customers in each of its network tests in Orlando and Houston
were incorrect.
   "Initially, 10 customers will get the phones," he said.
"We have to prove that we can coexist" with microwave
communications devices that also transmit in the
high-frequency bands that Millicom's personal network would
use. Referring to reports that 25,000 customers would get the
service in the Houston test, Mr. Bryan said: "That number is
an arbitrary number the FCC wanted us to put into the
filing." Extending the network to thousands of customers is
"an evolutionary process," he said.
   Millicom's test network would use one to three
transmitters, Mr. Bryan said.
   On paper, Millicom's plan looks workable: The military has
been using high-frequency communications for years.
Millicom's network would use thousands of radio systems --
about the size of a water cooler -- strategically placed in
city neighborhoods and office buildings to transmit and
receive calls.
   The little-used, high-frequency radio band should allow
for much-smaller phones requiring batteries that are about
one-fifth the size of those used in portable cellular phones.
   The personal-network phone itself would be smaller than a
wallet. To activate it, a caller would insert into the
receiver a so-called smart card containing a microprocessor
with his or her electronic identification. This smart card
would allow the caller to be reached anywhere the
personal-network equipment is located.
   It would seem that such a pocket phone has the potential
to give cellular phones -- which are bigger and operate at
lower frequency and require more electrical power -- a run
for their money.
   But the Swedish telecommunications-equipment company L.M.
Ericsson Telefon A.B. says it is already possible to offer
such personal-network service using tiny cellular
transmitters and receivers. Ericsson has begun testing such a
cellular system in Australia.

   As World War II's Allied powers celebrated the 45th
anniversary of their victory over Nazi Germany this week,
Germans themselves were looking forward to having the war
finally end for them, too. The two Germanys and four Allied
powers are negotiating the restoration of a fully sovereign,
unified Germany. The only remaining obstacles are the 380,000
Soviet occupation troops still on German soil and Moscow's
resistance to the idea of a unified Germany being a part of
the Western NATO alliance.
   Because the settlement of this crucial issue has a direct
bearing on whether Europe can enjoy further long years of
peace, both Europe and the United States are trying to guess
whether Moscow is merely stalling -- as so many Western
optimists insist -- or seriously intends to hang tough on the
troop-withdrawal question. The words and symbolism of
Moscow's Victory Day celebration on Wednesday were by no
means conclusive, but interesting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The star of the show was a military man, Marshal Dmitri T.
Yazov, Soviet minister of defense. Were it not for that great
panoply of destructive firepower rolling across Red Square
before the Lenin mausoleum reviewing stand, some of the
breast-beating would have been laughable. The lead float, for
example, had a Russian soldier cradling in his arms a female
"Germany," with a broken swastika below them. Today's Germany
should not forget, presumably, that the Russians came as
liberators, not conquerers. That hasn't always been obvious
to Germans.
   Marshal Yazov pressed injured innocence even further in a
TV address directed mainly at the Baltic peoples and their
own ingratitude. Freeing them from the Nazis had cost the
lives of 257,000 Soviet soldiers, he declared. He recalled
darkly that many Balts had fought for the Germans.
   The view of Russians that the peoples they have
"liberated" owe them a large debt has been imbedded in
communist theology for a long time. It draws emotional
content from the fact that the Soviet Union did indeed suffer
enormous losses during the "Great Patriotic War." By one
count, the war cost some 27 million lives on the Soviet side.
   But whatever credibility there ever was to the idea that
the world still owes Russia for its role in subduing the
Nazis nearly a half century ago is wearing thin. The Nazis
are long gone. West Germany, which will dominate a unified
Germany, has had 45 years of democracy.
   The Russian anniversary calendar omits some important
dates: Aug. 23, 1939, when the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was
signed, awarding Stalin Estonia, Latvia, East Poland and a
part of Finland; Sept. 28, when a secret protocol threw
Lithuania into the bargain; Nov. 30, when Soviet troops
invaded Finland and despite valiant Finnish resistance hived
off the southeastern corner of that country; June 15-17,
1940, when Soviet troops occupied Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia.
   Soviet citizens themselves are weary of the old rhetoric.
To be sure, there was no jeering crowd at Wednesday's parade,
as there had been on May Day. But then hardly any crowd at
all showed up for this year's display of Soviet might. Mr.
Yazov's assertion that the Soviet troops in the Baltic states
were not an "army of occupation" must have sounded like a
grim joke in Lithuania, where Moscow's imperial subjects were
at that moment struggling to get a small shipment of medical
supplies through the KGB's blockade at the Polish border.
   Given what most Soviet citizens now know about the
Communist Party's true history, it might have been wiser to
tone down the Victory Day rhetoric. Maybe Mr. Gorbachev let
Marshal Yazov do most of the talking to avoid further
embarrassment to himself. But did the party freely yield the
stage, as it often does on Victory Day, or was Marshal Yazov
asserting a claim of the Red Army to a larger role in today's
events, reinforcing that claim by reminding everyone of the
army's glorious past? In asserting the army's right to be in
Lithuania, was he tacitly defending as well its right to be
in Germany?
   If so, World War II is not quite over yet, at least from
the Red Army's point of view. Those Westerners who are in
such a hurry to dismantle NATO's defenses and reap that
imaginary "peace dividend" might do well to take the pompous
Soviet marshal more seriously. Those were real tanks, real
rocket launchers and real soldiers marching through Red
Square.

   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury said it has lifted its
suspension of Bell Atlantic Corp. from receiving future
business from the federal government after the company agreed
to verify the information it provided to the government.
   On April 3, the Treasury sent a letter to a Bell Atlantic
subsidiary, Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., alleging that
C&amp;P had made "material misrepresentations" in a bid for a
$100 million contract to modernize the Treasury's telephone
system in the Washington area. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. also is bidding on the work.

   Bell Atlantic said it was reinstated after it agreed to
tell its employees to check the information provided to the
government, including information supplied by subcontractors.
The phone company said it also agreed not to pursue further
litigation on the contract.

   ITT May Sell Some or All of 37% Stake
   In Alcatel Telecommunications Venture
   ----

   ITT Corp. indicated it might be willing to sell some or
all of its 37% stake in Alcatel N.V., a European
telecommunications joint venture. Outsiders value the stake
at about $3 billion.
   After ITT's comments at an analyst meeting in New York,
the company's stock, which had hit a new 52-week low in late
April, jumped $2 to close at $54.75 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Wall Street speculated that the
company would use the proceeds to buy back its shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, some analysts believe some proceeds could be
earmarked for capital spending because ITT also said at the
meeting that it plans to buy out its majority partner in two
New York City hotels.
   Alcatel was formed in 1986. To create it, ITT sold its
European telecommunications operations to Compaigne Generale
d'Electricite of France in exchange for $1.3 billion and 37%
of the stock of the newly combined CGE-ITT operations. The
remaining 63% in Alcatel is owned by CGE.
   An ITT spokesman confirmed that ITT and CGE would hold
discussions on ITT's Alcatel position after ITT completes its
annual meeting next week and CGE concludes a 5.5 billion
French franc ($999.8 million) bond offering.
   The key question is how much is ITT's Alcatel stake worth.
According to analysts at the meeting, ITT officials said they
didn't know what CGE paid for a 1.5% stake in Alcatel that it
had recently purchased from Credit Lyonnais, a French bank.
However, M. Cabell Woodward, ITT's vice chairman and chief
financial officer, said Wall Street believes it's worth about
$3 billion.
   It does seem that CGE may already be eyeing ITT's share of
Alcatel. At yesterday's meeting, Mr. Woodward acknowledged
that Pierre Suard, CGE's chairman, has said within the past
month that CGE wants to increase its Alcatel stake. He added
that CGE had discussed these intentions with ITT Chairman
Rand Araskog, who serves as chairman of Alcatel's supervisory
board.
   ITT's stock had slumped after a December analyst meeting
when Mr. Araskog praised Alcatel's profitability and growth
prospects in Eastern Europe. Many analysts, who had been
hoping ITT would unload some of its Alcatel stake this year,
took Mr. Araskog's comments then as an indication that ITT
planned to hold onto Alcatel for a long time. Under its
agreement with CGE, ITT wasn't permitted to sell any portion
of its Alcatel stake without CGE's permission until this
year.
   ITT took advantage of the slide in its stock to buy back
shares aggressively. It bought about 426,000 shares in the
first quarter and about 800,000 shares more since the second
quarter began.
   ITT officials also said at the meeting that the company
had a preliminary agreement to purchase Equitable Life
Assurance Society's majority position in the Sheraton Centre
Hotel and the Sheraton City Squire. Terms weren't disclosed.
ITT, based in New York, traditionally manages Sheraton
hotels. But with the acquisition from New York-based
Equitable, it would own the real estate for three midtown
Manhattan hotels, including the Sheraton St. Regis on Fifth
Avenue.
   Because of the hotel acquisitions and plans to begin major
renovations at both hotels later this year, ITT's capital
spending will be greater than the $750 million originally
planned. Phua Young at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. believes
the company could spend some $850 million this year and a
similar amount in 1991, depending on the extent of the
renovations.

   Gerber to Post Higher Profit for Year;
   Mulls Dividend Increase in the Summer
   ----

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)
</IN>
<LP>
   FREMONT, Mich. -- Gerber Products Co. says it expects to
exceed forecasts for the year ended March 31 by reporting
per-share earnings of about $2.50 from continuing operations.
   Alfred Piergallini, Gerber chairman and chief executive
officer, also predicted a 10% to 12% gain in per-share
earnings for the current first quarter as the company begins
what he sees as a year of improved margins and major product
development. He also anticipates another dividend increase
this summer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last year, Gerber earned 70 cents a share for the period,
which would put the current quarter's range at 77 to 78
cents.
   For fiscal 1989, Gerber earned $81.3 million, or $2.07 a
share on a post-split basis, on sales of $1.07 billion.
Continuing operations results totaled $2.17 a share.
   For the year just ended, Mr. Piergallini said earnings
would be up between 25%-30%, before charges of 34 cents for
discontinued operations. That could put net income at $2.46 a
share or more.
   The higher-than-estimated results reflect what the company
calls a "very strong" fourth quarter for its Gerber baby-food
division, substantial improvement for its Buster Brown
children's apparel business, export volume gains and
cost-containment efforts that boosted margins throughout the
organization.
   Mr. Piergallini said Gerber's major financial goals all
appear easily achievable: 24% return on equity, which should
be "surpassed nicely;" cash flow from operations of at least
15% of revenue, and real earnings growth of 6% to 8%.
   Gerber Products soon will test-market about two dozen
"transitional food" items aimed at children 12 to 36 months
old, Mr. Piergallini said.
   The line, which would bear the Gerber name, is likely to
include side dishes, fruit and vegetable snacks, cookies and
other bakery snacks, juice drinks, puddings and ready-to-eat
cereals, he said. Gerber sees incremental sales of between
$100 million and $150 million in the $1 billion toddler-food
market.
   "If everything goes well," Mr. Piergallini said, Gerber
would be rolling out products as early as next spring.
Initially the company is using co-packers, but the chief
executive said "it's my intention to bring them into the
company if the concept is successful."
   To win sales, the line will focus on nutrition as well as
products packaged to encourage self-feeding, Mr. Piergallini
said. Gerber may market a cold cereal that is low in sugar
and sodium. To win grocery-shelf space, the line will offer
retailers higher margins than some baby foods.
   Mr. Piergallini said many of the "transitional" foods
would be shelf-stable, but he didn't preclude a frozen item
or two. Some would be microwaveable.
   To improve its 71% of the domestic baby-food market, Mr.
Piergallini said Gerber is focusing on target accounts and
certain geographic areas to boost its share. Meanwhile, the
company is developing such products as the recently
introduced yogurt-and-juice line to expand its core business.
   Mr. Piergallini also said Gerber may add a soy-based
infant formula to complement its milk-based product, which he
said has about a 2.7% market share following its introduction
last year.
   Gerber Products will also develop new products to enhance
its Gerber-branded general merchandise business.
   Mr. Piergallini said the company is doing about $70
million in sales, primarily in grocery stores. A dedicated
sales force will seek to broaden distribution into
mass-merchandise and related outlets, he said.
   The company may seek to fill in niches in this market
through acquisitions, Mr. Piergallini said, adding that while
Gerber has identified several prospects it has no immediate
acquisition plans.
   Some analysts have suggested that Gerber dispose of its
children's apparel business, but Mr. Piergallini, who came to
the company early this year from Nestle's Carnation unit,
said, "We think it still fits into our strategic objectives."
   While earnings from children's wear were between 6% and 8%
of sales this past year, Mr. Piergallini said he hopes to
increase that return to 10% this year. Environmental concerns
about disposable diapers are enhancing sales of Gerber's line
of cloth diapers, he said.
   Meanwhile, the new chief executive is implementing a
productivity program and cost-cutting effort designed to cut
fixed overhead by 2% this year. The company already has saved
"an awful lot of money" by going to a lighter-weight glass
jar, he said. Also, as much as 40% of the glass is recycled
material.
   Gerber is concentrating on expanding sales in Europe, Mr.
Piergallini said, citing a joint venture with CPC
International in France and a recent entry into Poland.
Gerber also is about to open a cereal plant near Alexandria,
Egypt, to serve the Middle East. In the Pacific Rim, Gerber
is looking for what its chairman called "partnerships and
alliances with other companies. I doubt you would see Gerber
go it alone there."

   Everyone knows how fast technology is changing. Everyone
knows about markets becoming global and about shifts in the
work force and in demographics. But few people pay attention
to changing distributive channels. Yet, how goods and
services get to customers and where customers buy are
changing fully as fast as technology, markets and demography.
And they are changing fast all over the world.
   The bulk of consumer electronics -- radios, TVs, VCRs,
calculators -- were sold in Britain 15 years ago by thousands
of independent, locally owned "mom-and-pop" shops. Today the
bulk of these goods is sold by four national chains. The
mom-and-pop shop had to carry major manufacturers' brands and
relied on the manufacturers' advertising. The four big chains
carry their own private brands and do their own advertising.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the U.S. office furniture -- chairs, desks, filing
cabinets -- was bought 15 years ago in specialized
office-furniture stores. Increasingly these goods are now
being bought in discount stores and "buying clubs."
   The recent Japanese promise to repeal the law that
protects their mom-and-pop shops and keeps out big stores and
chains, has been hailed as a great American victory. But in
Japan's metropolitan areas (where 60% of the population live
and shop), a majority of the mom &amp; pop shops have already
been converted into franchises of huge chains such as
7/Eleven or Mister Donut.
   Six or seven years ago, mutual funds were distributed in
the U.S. through two channels: indirectly, through brokerage
houses and directly, through TV advertising. These two
channels still carry something like three-fifths of all
mutual funds sold. But one of the big mutual-fund groups
(which six years ago sold exclusively through brokers) now
sells 15% of its products through regional banks, 15% through
insurance agencies and another 15% through professional and
trade associations.
   The hospital became a major market only 25 years ago. But
then the hospital itself bought the goods it used. Now a
steadily growing share is bought by independent outsiders to
whom the hospital contracts maintenance, patient feeding,
billing, physical therapy, the pharmacy, X-ray, the medical
lab and so on.
   Increasingly even large users do not themselves buy their
computers. They are bought instead by computer management
firms that design, buy, install and run their clients'
information systems. A major computer maker, Digital
Equipment Corp. now has its own computer-management
subsidiary.
   Where customers buy is changing fast too.
   Many major department store chains are in serious trouble.
Some once great stores -- Bonwit Teller, for instance, or B.
Altman, only recently New York's fashion leaders -- are going
out of business. Others, such as Bloomingdale's, are in
bankruptcy. But one chain, Seattle-based Nordstrom, has been
doing well. The department stores that are in trouble are all
organized and run as downtown stores with suburban branches.
Nordstrom has only suburban stores. We may be seeing the
first result of the slow but steady move of office work out
of downtown and into the suburbs where the office workers
live.
   The big "wire houses," the New York-based stockbrokers
such as Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman, did exceptionally
well only a few years ago. Now they are losing sales and
profits. But some large "regional" houses (i.e., brokers not
headquartered in New York) such as A.G. Edwards in St. Louis,
are doing fine. And so are some "institutional brokers" such
as New York-based Sanford Bernstein.
   The wire houses serve both the "retail customer" -- the
individual investor -- and the "wholesale customer" -- the
pension funds. A.G. Edwards serves primarily the retail
market, Sanford Bernstein exclusively the institutional
market. Traditionally large stockbrokers were successful in
serving both markets. But in no other line of business, do
retail customers and wholesale customers shop in the same
place. Are the securities markets now segmenting themselves
the way every other market has?
   Changes in distributive channels may not matter much to
GNP and macro-economics. But they should be a major concern
of every business and every industry. Yet they are very
difficult to predict. What's worse: They do not show up in
reports and statistics until they have gone very far. They
are what statisticians call "changes at the margin." And by
the time such changes become statistically significant, it is
usually too late to adapt to them, let alone to exploit them
as opportunities.
   The one way to be abreast of them is to go out and look
for these changes. Here again are a few examples:
   Alfred P. Sloan built General Motors into the world's
premier manufacturing company, in the '20s and '30, by
actually working with customers. Once every three months he
would disappear from Detroit without telling any one where he
was going. The next morning he would show up at a dealer's
lot in Memphis or Albany, would introduce himself and would
ask the dealer's permission to work as a salesman for a
couple of days or as an assistant service manager. During
that week he would work like this in two more dealerships in
two other cities. The following Monday he'd be back in
Detroit, firing off memoranda on changing customer behavior
and changing customer preferences, on dealer service and on
company service to the dealer, on market trends and style
trends.
   GM in those years had the most up-to-date and
comprehensive customer research in American industry. And yet
-- at least so I was told by the then head of customer
research at GM-Sloan, by actually working in the field
spotted more and more important trends than did customer
research, and spotted them earlier.
   The late Karl Bays made American Hospital Corp. the leader
in its industry during the 1970s. He himself credited his
success largely to his going out into the field. Twice a year
he would take for two weeks each the place of a salesman on
vacation. When the salesman came back, Bays said (with a
twinkle in his eye) "the customer always complained about the
incompetence of his replacement and about the dumb questions
I asked." But selling, Bays said, was not the point of the
exercise; learning was.
   Another variant: two men who together took over a small
and lackluster chain of fashion shops in the mid-'50s built
it into one of America's retail giants. For 30 years, until
their retirement, each spent every Saturday in a different
shopping mall. They did not visit their own stores. They
spent the day in other companies' stores -- some fashion
stores, some book shops, some stores for household goods and
so on, watching shoppers, watching sales people, chatting
with store managers. And they insisted that every one of
their senior executives do likewise, including the lawyer,
the controller and the vice president for personnel.
   As a result, the company foresaw in the early '60s the
coming of the "youth culture" and built or remodelled stores
to attract teen-agers. A few years later, when every one
talked of the "greening of America" the company realized that
the youth culture was passe and changed merchandise and
stores to attract the young adult. And another 10 years
later, well before 1980, the company saw and understood the
emergence of the two-earner family.
   To be able to anticipate changes in distributive channels
and in where customers buy (and how, which is equally
important) one has to be in the marketplace, has to watch
customers, and non-customers, has to ask "dumb questions." It
is almost 40 years since I first advised executives to "walk
around" -- that is, to get out of their offices, visit and
talk to their associates in the company. This was the right
advice then; now it is the wrong thing to do, and a waste of
the executive's scarcest resource, his time. For now we know
how to build upward information into the organization. To
depend on walking around actually may lull executives into a
false sense of security; it may make them believe that they
have information when all they have is what their
subordinates wanted them to hear.
   The right advice to executives now is to walk outside.

   On one hand, the agreement has helped thaw industrial
relations between two wary Arctic neighbors -- Norway and the
Soviet Union.
   On the other, it is the clearest sign yet of increasing
flexibility on the part of Soviet trade negotiators, given
that it required a virtually unprecedented agreement between
two autocratic Soviet ministries.
   PepsiCo says the new trade agreement will enable it to
more than double its sales within the Soviet Union to the
equivalent of about $2.5 billion by the year 2000. PepsiCo
won't be able to take any revenue from those sales out of the
country, but it will get the rights to export two products:
vodka and ships. It expects to sell $500 million of Soviet
vodka in the U.S. during the next 10 years, plus generate an
unspecified amount of revenue through sales and leases of 10
ships.
   But PepsiCo didn't want the risks associated with the
shipping business, so it has reached an agreement with Per
Arneberg, a Bermuda-based Norwegian shipping mogul, to take
responsibility for marketing the ships. PepsiCo will get
fixed -- and unspecified -- revenue from the Arneberg group,
which will then take on all the risks and garner the
potential profits.
   For Mr. Arneberg, the deal achieves his years-old dream of
building ships in the Soviet Union. Now he and some allies
have embarked on a plan to overhaul a half-dozen Soviet
shipyards where the vessels will be built.
   The Norwegians will start by replacing outmoded designs to
make Soviet ships more attractive to Western buyers, then
spend millions of dollars to install modern shipbuilding
equipment.
   Mr. Arneberg says Norwegian suppliers are lined up to
deliver everything from computerized ship-design centers to
turbo-charged marine engines. They're even bringing in beef
cattle requested by one Soviet shipyard near the Black Sea to
bolster local food supplies.
   Historically, most Soviet-built ships have been delivered
to state-controlled domestic shippers. But the planned move
into the new world of export markets appears to be
well-timed. Global demand for new tonnage is soaring, while
new building slots at major shipyards remain virtually
unobtainable before 1993.
   Still, even with Norwegian money and engineering prowess,
it won't be easy to repair the tarnished reputation of Soviet
shipbuilders. "Political risks and the threat of delays cause
most Western shipowners to try to get ships built just about
anyplace but the Soviet Union," says one Norwegian shipping
broker.
   Adds Ole Jacob Libaek, president of another big Oslo
shipbroker and a close adviser to Mr. Arneberg: "To put it
bluntly, our challenge is to bring Soviet shipbuilding into
the 20th century."
   Mr. Arneberg left Norway in the 1950s and, after
graduating from Cornell University in the U.S., built a
career in U.S. shipping. The recovery of shipping markets in
recent years whetted his interest in low-cost ships built in
Eastern Europe, but East Bloc regimes rebuffed his overtures
about selling ships to the West.
   Mr. Arneberg got his big break in the summer of 1988, when
he turned to an old hunting and fishing chum, PepsiCo
Chairman Donald Kendall. The U.S. concern had been active in
the Soviet Union for years and, since 1972, had held
exclusive U.S. marketing rights for Soviet vodka under a
pioneering countertrade pact.
   "But to expand capacity and distribution in the Soviet
Union, Pepsi needed something more vigorous and large scale
than simply selling vodka," a PepsiCo spokesman says.
   Mr. Kendall balked at getting directly involved in
volatile shipping markets. But he agreed to sponsor Mr.
Arneberg in Moscow, where PepsiCo and its chairman wielded
considerable political clout.
   Once in Moscow, Mr. Arneberg moved fast. "The Soviets were
sitting on a vessel that had been in inventory a while,"
recalls Chris Adamski, a PepsiCo official who participated in
the Moscow negotiations. Mr. Arneberg immediately agreed to
buy the ship, "showing that we could move quickly. The
Soviets were intrigued," he adds.
   It still took almost a year longer than expected to hammer
out details of the trade accord. The biggest snag concerned
bureaucratic turf: PepsiCo's existing countertrade pact was
with the Ministry of Procurement and Agriculture. But Mr.
Arneberg would be buying ships from the Ministry of
Shipbuilding. "There was no formal linkage between the
ministries," Mr. Adamski says. "So the deal had to be
approved at a higher level, allowing foreign exchange earned
through the Shipbuilding Ministry's exports to be used for
the soft drinks industry," administered by the Agriculture
Ministry.
   Mr. Arneberg is convinced that the number of ships
contracted and delivered will be much higher than the 10
promised -- between 75 and 80 vessels by 1995. If he
succeeds, PepsiCo would reap extra trade credits that it
could use to speed construction of Pizza Hut restaurants,
which it plans in collaboration with a Soviet joint-venture
partner.
   Exploiting his inside track with the Shipbuilding
Ministry, Mr. Arneberg began ordering ships before the
PepsiCo agreement was concluded. Fram Shipping, the
Bermuda-based shipping concern where Mr. Arneberg until
recently was president, has taken delivery of seven Soviet
ships and has another 12 under construction. He says the
Soviets agreed to count three of those orders against
PepsiCo's 10-ship commitment.
   Citing recent installation of a pacemaker, Mr. Arneberg
says he stepped down as Fram Shipping's president "to take it
a little easier." But he remains a director and adviser.
   Fram Shipping's Soviet orderbook includes both bulk
carriers and tankers. Anticipating a legislative crackdown on
tanker design in the wake of recent oil spills, Mr. Arneberg
says all the tankers will be built with double bottoms and
double skins -- concentrating on medium-sized Aframax class
vessels of about 90,000 dead weight tons. Shipping analysts
in Oslo confirm that markets have easily absorbed the Soviet
ships delivered to Mr. Arneberg so far. Underscoring the
tight market conditions, Mr. Arneberg boasts of "tying up
three new Soviet tankers on 12-year charters with a
Scandinavian oil company." The 12-year duration is
exceptional -- more than double the normal period for tanker
charters, analysts say.
   "We're building against what we believe future demand will
be three years from now," Mr. Libaek, his shipbroker adviser,
says. "We hope we're right."
   Many analysts suggest Mr. Arneberg's problem lies less in
selling the ships than getting good ones built. But that
challenge, whetted by prospects of big orders, has galvanized
Norway's powerful shipping-supply industry and big banks to
clamor for a piece of the action.
   Big Oslo banks like Den norske Banken and Christiania Bank
&amp; Kreditkasse have provided financing for Mr. Arneberg's
initial Soviet ships, transactions in the range of $20
million to $30 million each. Anders Ingebrigtsen, the banker
in charge of Kreditkasse's $4 billion portfolio of shipping
loans, sees potential for much bigger future deals, perhaps
by packaging a number of these vessels in globally syndicated
credits.
   "This project can be important for Norwegian industry,"
says Mr. Ingebrigtsen. "But it remains to be seen how fast
Mr. Arneberg and associates can develop the facilities and
how fast the Soviets are able to adjust."
   Mr. Libaek, the Oslo shipping broker, is optimistic.
"We've already fought for years trying to get our technical
and commercial recommendations accepted," he says.
"Individually, most people at the shipyards had accepted
them. But you needed a change in politics for new ideas and
concepts to be taken seriously in the Soviet Union."
   The Norwegian group is betting millions of dollars in
initial investments that the political change is for real.
The outlays to re-equip shipyards are to be gradually
recouped through a rebate on the price of each new ship
delivered.
   "You'd go broke trying to pay for this on one ship," Mr.
Libaek says. "But the cost per contract can be acceptable,
spread over bigger volume."

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The business of creating new computer
software -- the programs that make computers work -- is one
of the most complex, painstaking, even exasperating jobs
around. It is as if someone is writing "War and Peace" in
code, puts one letter out of place and turns the whole book
into gibberish.
   So difficult is the process that it can baffle even such
industry stars as Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus
Development Corp., and Peter Miller, a well-known veteran. In
November 1987, the two men formed a software company with the
announced intention of making personal computers much easier
to use.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the path to simplicity proved tortuous, and not until
early last month did they finally turn over to their
manufacturing plant their first product, a single floppy
disk. The software was late and far over budget; in fact, it
almost didn't make it out the door. And it bore little
resemblance to their original plans.
   Besides the inherent complexity of the work, there are
other problems. Most software-development planning stinks: A
joke in the industry is that programmers spend 90% of their
time on the first 80% of a project and 90% of their time on
the final 20%. And most design stinks, too: Programmers
either don't understand their customers well enough or load
up products with features that please themselves but perplex
everyone else.
   Meanwhile, computer-using companies trying to become more
efficient have a problem: They have ample computer hardware
but lack adequate software. And they won't get it soon.
   The difficulties faced by Messrs. Kapor and Miller and
their 23 employees at the fledgling company, ON Technology
Inc., go a long way toward explaining the hopes and fears
that drive the $8 billion-a-year software industry. The
39-year-old Mr. Kapor agreed to give this newspaper an inside
look as their initial project unfolded because he believes
that software design must be improved and the development
process better understood.
   The story begins in the summer of 1987. Mr. Kapor had
recently wound down his dealings with Lotus, where he
developed the 1-2-3 spreadsheet that, in selling more than
five million copies since 1983, made Lotus into one of the
world's software giants and powered the whole
personal-computer industry into liftoff. Mr. Kapor, who left
Lotus because it was getting too big, had taken a floor of
office space in a professional building but had no projects.
   All he had was his horror at the difficulty of using
computers. "Not a day goes by that I don't want to throw my
computer out the window," he said.
   Mr. Kapor chatted with Mr. Miller, who used to work at
Lotus, and found that he had some ideas but no office space.
They got together. They shared an interest in a new area of
software, object-oriented programming. And they worried that
although their secretary would know what to do if they wanted
to send a letter to Joe, their word-processing software
wouldn't know who Joe was, how to send him a letter, how
formally to address it.
   The two men decided to produce a new layer of software
that would let developers build such real-world knowledge
into their applications. With that idea and Mr. Kapor's name,
ON quickly lured some high-profile programmers and built up
to 32 people. Mr. Kapor drew on his considerable wealth to
finance the project and attracted investment from two
venture-capital firms that made fortunes on Lotus.
   The place resembled a think tank, with people waving magic
markers while arguing around whiteboards or occasionally
writing papers on software theory. There was a plastic
dinosaur in the lobby, carrying a sign saying, "Welcome,
Insurance Salesmen, Investment Advisers, Marketing
Consultants, Industrial Spies." A couple of pingpong tables
were in the back.
   But the big hardware and software companies didn't see ON
as benign: They worried that new, popular software would give
the newcomer too much leverage. Some indicated that they
would try to quash the project by promising to deliver
similar capability themselves. Mr. Kapor found that, in any
case, he was years away from having a product and was running
through $300,000 a month. So, in December 1988, he says, "we
took the plan out and we shot it. We got it up at six in the
morning, blindfolded it and shot it."
   The company fell into chaos for three months. Employees
started arriving late and leaving early. Some drifted away as
their work disappeared. Others were asked to leave. Mr. Kapor
went to the venture capitalists for more money. Wags started
calling the company OFF Technology.
   Even though the company shrank 50%, three projects took
shape. The first, called On Location, was handed over to two
young programmers in April 1989. This followed conventional
wisdom that, for good communication, software should be
written by teams no larger than four people -- that nine
women can't have one baby by being pregnant a month each.
   The senior programmer was Roy Groth, now 27 years old, who
spent his evenings and weekends playing trumpet in various
bands. The other was Rob Tsuk (pronounced Chook), a husky
24-year-old. Also heavily involved was graphic designer Paul
Moody, a 31-year-old car nut who kept a rearview mirror on
his Macintosh so he could watch what was going on outside his
office door. Mr. Miller, a 45-year-old who describes his
style as management by walking around, was to supervise.
   The basic idea behind the product was that people can
store so much information on hard disks that the disks, like
file cabinets, can become so crammed with stuff that it is
hard to remember what anything was called or where it is.
Products that search for files are slow. So, Messrs. Kapor
and Miller decided there's room for a product for the
Macintosh such as On Location, which would keep an index of
what's where. The index would take up 1% to 2% of the hard
disk but, they said, would find files 10 to 15 times faster
than other products used by the four million Macintoshes
operating world-wide.
   The basic approach was to build, try out and then fix
repeated prototypes, with each a bit closer to the final
product. That paid off when a mockup was shown to three
industry gurus. One of them, Bobby Orbach, until recently a
senior executive at 47th Street Computer, a New York
retailer, said the product must be able to find any word in
any file, not just the file names as originally planned. That
proved to be a crucial piece of advice.
   Messrs. Groth and Tsuk started churning out the code,
writing in a language with few verbs and awash in
punctuation, such as: printf("%3.0f %6.1f/n", fahr,
celsius);. They appeared to be making progress toward a
shipment date of early November. Mr. Kapor turned to
marketing and hired Conall Ryan, a 32-year-old who once
worked for him at Lotus.
   Mr. Moody started what the team called the product's
choreography, figuring out how the user would use the product
and anticipating all the errors he might make. It's a
daunting task. Mr. Moody went through more than 200 versions
of how the program should look on a monitor.
   The office became intense, with programmers on all three
projects sometimes working in bursts and then falling asleep
in their offices, sometimes working well into the night at
home. Spirits were high; the pingpong games turned fierce.
Mr. Ryan instituted a Friday-afternoon party, whose start was
signaled by blasting music over the intercom and then by the
sound of beer glug-glugging into a glass.
   By early September, Mr. Miller said the product's features
were essentially complete, and Mr. Kapor said he would be
surprised if it wasn't finished by November. But then
everything started going wrong. Features that were supposed
to take a day to produce took three or four.
   The biggest, potentially fatal problem concerned the
product's ability to index automatically. A tiny piece of the
software was supposed to be always active in the main memory,
watching to see when a file is created or changed, so it
could call in more of the software when the computer is idle
and update the index. But the Macintosh operating system
tries to kill off pieces of software like that. There
appeared to be no solution.
   The group pored over lengthy printouts, called dumps, that
contain a sort of map of what's going on in the computer's
main memory. The dumps consist of groupings of letters and
numbers that, if they weren't arranged in eight-character
strings, would look as though someone had rested his elbows
on a keyboard for an hour. To the initiated, they reveal an
artful way to hide from the operating system by hiding inside
it. It is a dangerous game of hide and seek. Mr. Tsuk later
spent several days debugging this bit of software, and it
kept crashing the system right up until the end.
   In September, Mr. Ryan started what he called Real Dinners
for Real People: He brought in half a dozen Macintosh users,
fed them lasagna and got their reactions to the latest
prototype of On Location. This proved to be a smart move
because it gave the team extensive feedback much earlier than
usual. Most software is like a digital watch -- there are
features that nobody needs, and it's tough to figure out
which does what to whom. But feedback helped Mr. Kapor keep
banging away at two truths in software design: Simplicity is
paramount, and less is often more.
   At the first Real Dinner, Mr. Groth recalls, the Real
People looked at the installation procedure and said, "You
must be kidding." He laughed. "So, we said, `You're right. We
were kidding.'" Several more tries, and dinners, were needed
to get it right. In the process, the team discarded a plan to
let people keep their own indexes of all the files on all the
hard disks on a network. It was hard to write the code and
impossible for users to figure it out.
   But the schedule kept slipping further and further. As the
shipment date headed toward the end of last year, Mr. Kapor
worried that ON would miss the Christmas selling season.
"It's like a Russian doll," Mr. Ryan says. "Every time we
finally crack open one problem, we find there's another one
inside."
   The company also was running out of money again. So, Mr.
Kapor had to go back to the venture capitalists, a move that
would raise total financing to $9 million with no product to
show for it. Mr. Kapor made a get-tough speech at a weekly
staff meeting in September. "I'm not going to bail this out
if it fails," he said. "We're playing with live ammo."
   Two weeks later, Mr. Kapor got excited because he had an
idea about future products that he described as being as good
an idea as the one that led him to fame with Lotus 1-2-3. But
it required cancellation of the two projects beyond On
Location. Five more programmers left.
   The lone survivor from one of the projects was 27-year-old
Nancy Benovich. She was asked to write the software to do
so-called fuzzy searches, so that if someone wants all the
files that contain the word "love," he will also get "loves,"
"loving" and "loved." Messrs. Kapor and Miller believed that
her role would be discrete enough not to cause a problem. It
did.
   Ms. Benovich and Mr. Tsuk wound up writing codes that
overlapped ever so slightly but bollixed up matters for days.
In certain circumstances, their codes could clear a bit of
memory twice, a nasty development that usually made the
system crash -- and so as to leave the basic problem hard to
locate. However, debugging tools have improved so much that,
once the type of problem was recognized, the team sent some
software over telephone wires, attached its sensors to On
Location and quickly pinpointed the problem.
   As it became clear that Christmas was out, shipments were
postponed until January, and the developers breathed a sigh
of relief. But even as most of the features were completed,
development slowed as the bug-fixing process kicked into
gear.
   Bug-fixing is actually much simpler on the Macintosh than
on IBM-compatible PCs. There are only a few types of
Macintoshes, all made by Apple Computer Inc. In contrast,
there are hundreds of IBM-compatible computers, all slightly
different and all able to trip up the software in mysterious
ways. Nevertheless, thousands of Macintosh applications are
on the market, and the team had to make sure that its
software doesn't foul up any of them.
   Candace Clampitt, 33, who ran the bug-fixing process, had
three people banging on machines all day and had tests run
automatically through the night. Mr. Tsuk sometimes spent
whole days trying to duplicate, and then resolve, problems
reported by people inside ON or by outside test users. At one
point, he made a typing error and wiped out three computers,
which had to be painstakingly resurrected. Mr. Groth put a
"Do Not Disturb" sign on his door and forged ahead.
   As the hours got longer, Mr. Groth got carried away when
writing messages that alert the user to options or problems.
Instead of the computer screen showing a box that read
"Cancel" when someone has the option of killing a file, he
had the box say, "Make My Day." But, as Messrs. Groth and
Tsuk worked through the holidays, they seemed to be getting
close. Shipment was set for mid-February.
   Mr. Ryan, meanwhile, was winding up the marketing end. The
list price had been set at $129.95, with the actual retail
price at $75 to $85. The hope had been that users could be
persuaded that On Location was in a different class than
other software and thus should cost more. But the Real
Dinners made it clear that wouldn't work. So, Mr. Ryan told
Lillian Rosen to get below $8 the unit cost of duplicating
the disks and putting them in the boxes. She succeeded: Each
unit would cost ON $7.47.
   Mr. Kapor moved everyone into half the office space on the
floor and prepared to rent out the other half. When Ms.
Benovich completed her task on On Location, she was told
there was no more work for her and was asked to leave. "It's
one of those tough business decisions you have to make," Mr.
Miller said. ON was no longer a think tank.
   When announcement day, Jan. 22, finally arrived, Mr. Kapor
charmed a group of about 30 reporters at a press conference
in the cafeteria. Afterward, as the programmers ran off to
change out of their suits and ties, a reflective Mr. Kapor
expressed some mixed feelings. "Software planning, at its
best, is a mess," he said. "And this wasn't its best."
   Everyone acknowledges being far too optimistic on timing.
Mr. Kapor also says some problems could have been solved by
tighter management, to keep Messrs. Groth and Tsuk from
spending too much time polishing their code and from fixing
bugs before they knew that the solutions wouldn't create more
problems later.
   The prototyping, though helping with the design, may have
hampered the scheduling. Jeff Gibbons, a 37-year-old senior
programmer, says it is relatively easy to know how long it
will take to add a feature but hard to know how long it will
take to turn a feature from bug-ridden code into a finished
version.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Kapor declares himself pleased with the
design process. And early reviews support him. "On Location
winds up being a pretty incredible product from a design
standpoint," says Stewart Alsop, the editor of PC Letter, an
industry newsletter. The only complaints have been that the
company didn't deliver on its initial vision and used a whole
lot of brainpower to attack a narrow problem. "It's as though
William Faulkner wrote a really nice cookbook," says Richard
Shaffer, the editor of Technologic Computer Letter.
   The shipment date slipped to late February, but that
seemed a small problem. At a PC conference in late January,
Mr. Kapor made a tough speech about the sorry state of
software design and generated interest in forming a group to
figure out ways to attack the problem.
   But Mr. Kapor had a nasty surprise awaiting him when he
returned. On Location was slipping again. This time, no one
even pretended to know how far behind the product really was.
The marketing people told Mr. Kapor that they couldn't
operate without a firm schedule and that they no longer had
any confidence in the development group's ability to provide
one.
   Mr. Kapor had some long, hard sessions with Mr. Miller,
who stormed out once but then returned. Mr. Kapor decided to
become his Siamese twin in managing the project. They
gathered the team together and produced an excruciatingly
detailed accounting of all the work still to be done. They
decided they could finish in a bit more than a month, but
only by stopping work on the second project and devoting
three more programmers to On Location.
   "This is a mess," Mr. Kapor said. "A month's delay isn't
that bad, but it's sort of, `Do I really need this?`"
   Office tensions heated up again, but the process stayed
remarkably close to the new schedule. The product -- the 30th
version circulated internally -- finally went to
manufacturing.
   Even that wasn't the end of the turmoil. Two weeks later,
Mr. Miller quit, and Messrs. Groth and Tsuk agreed to leave.
Mr. Kapor says there was less here than meets the eye -- Mr.
Miller may work on another project that Mr. Kapor would back,
and Messrs. Groth and Tsuk were leaving because of
personality conflicts that developed during the final days.
Still, the departures left the young company with still
another set of challenges.
   Mr. Kapor, reflective again, says, "I view this as
character-building." The former transcendental-meditation
teacher adds, "I'm moving closer to spiritual enlightenment.
I'm not 10,000 miles away. I'm 9,999 miles away."
   He, and all the others, vow to do better with their next
project. But there's another software axiom that usually
proves true. Called Hofstadter's law, it's circular: It says
software development always takes longer than you think, even
when you take into account Hofstadter's law.

   Your March 19 OTC focus on Newbridge Networks provided
some bogus information.
   On failure rates, for example, I would like to point out
that failure statistics are absolute numbers. If I purchase
100 widgets and 10 fail, that yields an absolute failure rate
of 10%. One can then say that provided I buy similar
equipment, I can project failures of approximately 10% plus
or minus about 3%. In a projection, the failures haven't
happened yet, but in the historical analysis, the figures are
absolute, and no amount of wishful thinking can change them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is therefore impossible to have a failure rate of
between 20% and 50%, as quoted in your article by a former
Newbridge customer (who happens to be affiliated with a
Newbridge competitor). Let me tell you that Newbridge's
historical failure rates are below 2%. To be exact, 1.97%.
   There is no mystery here. My company, Novatel, buys more
Newbridge 3624 Channel Banks than any other company in the
U.S. We don't hide them away in a closet, we install them. We
install the majority on MCI spans. We also sell and install
Telco Systems and Rockwell Channel Banks. I'm happy to say we
have very satisfied customers. The facts are therefore
absolute, can't be adjusted, can't be ignored. Newbridge
makes very high-quality, feature-packed, cost-effective
Channel Banks and TI Multiplexers.

   Psychiatrists Hold Mass Meeting
   As Oedipus Wrecks Mother's Day

   NEW YORK -- Look who's `conflicted' now: the
psychiatrists.
   The American Psychiatric Association masses here on
Mother's Day weekend with a bit of guilt. It's the fifth year
in a row that the weighty annual meeting falls on the
maternal holiday and the 10th such clash in the past 22
years.

   "There have been questions raised," concedes Melvin
Sabshin, APA medical director. Complaints began in earnest
around 1985, when the group got its first woman president.
But "it isn't easy to accommodate" 16,000 people, says Dr.
Sabshin. Bookings are made years in advance; few cities can
handle such a big group; May is tough -- too early and the
weather's nasty, too late and members complain about missing
family graduations.
   "I've often wondered why they don't examine their
collective psyche on this," says the wife of a Midwest
psychiatrist. (She prefers anonymity, noting, "I've kept my
peace this long.") Her husband is retiring after 40 years,
and she'll be with him in New York this weekend. But, "I'm
upset we're not going to be home to celebrate with our
children and grandchildren."
   And well she should be, asserts Dorothy W. Cantor, a
psychologist in Westfield, N.J. "There's something sacred
about Mother's Day and Father's Day," says Ms. Cantor, who
has a general practice and has written about women's and
family concerns. From a clinical standpoint, too, Mother's
Day "is a big deal," she says.
   The holiday can exacerbate any problems between mother and
child, says Ms. Cantor. She adds that some of her own
patients are "going through terrible things." The main
psychologists' group, the American Psychological Association,
steers clear of major holidays, holding its annual meeting in
the summer.
   But the psychiatrists are working their problem through.
Next year, they'll meet on Mother's Day in New Orleans. But
in 1992, 1993 and 1994, the session will be on other weekends
in May.
   As in corporate life, much of the change regarding women
comes from women themselves reaching positions of authority.
"The more you're in a position of leadership, the more what
you say gets attended to," says Elissa Benedek,
president-elect of the APA. She says all four of her children
are along for this year's meeting, although that hasn't
always been possible.
   "I think it's very likely we'll not be scheduling any more
meetings on Mother's Day in the future," says Dr. Benedek.

   House Votes Unpaid Leave for Workers,
   Measure May Not Survive Probable Veto

   WASHINGTON -- After a sometimes emotionally charged
debate, the House passed a bill that would grant workers as
much as 12 weeks of unpaid annual leave to care for newborn
or adopted children, or seriously ill family members.
   But the vote, 237-187, fell short of the two-thirds vote
needed to override the presidential veto predicted earlier
this week by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Administration officials say President Bush believes the
government shouldn't force employers to offer specific
benefits. Business groups, fearing the leave bill could lead
to mandated health insurance, vehemently opposed the measure
on that basis.
   Rep. Fred Grandy, the Iowa Republican who led the fight
against the measure, said he was cautiously optimistic that
the narrow House vote would dim the bill's prospects in the
Senate, where a similar bill would grant workers 10 weeks of
unpaid family leave annually and another 13 weeks of unpaid
personal medical leave over a two-year period.
   It is uncertain when the Senate will take up the matter
for consideration. Both measures exempt very small businesses
based on the number of employees.
   But Rep. Patricia Schroeder, (D., Colo.), who first
introduced the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1985, said she
was "delighted" with the vote. "I think we're in the ball
park {for overriding any veto}. Congress understands what
American families are going through. People stood up and did
what they think is right."
   The House bill sets a total of three months of unpaid
leave to cover either the employee's own medical emergencies,
the care of newborn or adopted children or the care of
seriously ill family members. Businesses would be required to
continue health benefits during the period.
   Sponsors of the House measure said the legislation would
cost businesses close to $200 million annually to cover the
cost of health benefits for workers on leave and the cost of
training temporary replacements.
   Companies with fewer than 50 employees aren't covered by
the measure. The provisions, a compromise fashioned by Reps.
Bart Gordon (D., Tenn.) and Curt Weldon, (R., Pa.), scaled
back Rep. Schroeder's original measure that set separate
leave periods for family and medical needs.
   During the floor debate, Reps. Vic Fazio, (D., Calif.) and
Democratic Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) spoke
of their personal family crises when their children
contracted cancer. Rep. Raymond McGrath, (R., N.Y.), said his
family recently had to hire a full-time nurse to care for his
mother who needs round-the-clock care. "We turn away from
this at our peril," Mr. Fazio said. "It's tough enough for
families to make it economically in this country. I hope
we'll have at least the compassion to make this one step
forward."
   Illinois Republican Henry Hyde, known for his
anti-abortion views, said that he "agonized over the bill.
I'm not appalled by federal mandates; we do it for jury duty
and ROTC. . . .society should encourage motherhood and not
abortions."
   Opponents of the bill emphasized that mandating family
leave would reverse the trend toward letting workers
negotiate with employers for the benefits they prefer and
favor high-income workers who can better afford to take
unpaid time off.
   "The government can't balance the budget, it can't control
spending, yet it's trying to micromanage the private sector,"
said John Sloan, president of the National Federation of
Independent Business, a small-business group. But a lobbyist
for the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, Mary
Tavenner, said that faced with the presidential veto threat,
the vote "sends a clear signal that this bill is technically
dead in the water." The groups represent small and large
companies.
   Rep. Marge Roukema, (R., N.J.), one of the bill's
co-sponsors, said that after the vote, she asked, for the
second time this week, that Republican supporters of the
measure get a chance to air their views at the White House.
   She said the administration's threat to veto the bill in
its present form used the usual "good cop-bad cop" language
that the administration adopts as it enters into
negotiations. She added that the measure's level of
bipartisan support and its concern for legitimate business
interests could ultimately get the president's support.

   Chairman Sees
   Daimler-Benz
   On Right Track

   STUTTGART, West Germany -- Chairman Edzard Reuter, under
fire for Daimler-Benz AG's faltering profits and a corporate
restructuring, is poised to at least temporarily disarm his
critics.
   Daimler-Benz is expected to announce next week that the
group's first-quarter profit was above the average quarterly
operating profit for 1989, as car sales in the U.S. and West
Germany bounced back from a 1989 slump. Group profit for 1989
was 1.7 billion marks ($1.04 billion), excluding a one-time
gain of 5.1 billion marks. Profits from the group's truck
division, which helped offset last year's slump in
passenger-car profits, show continued strength this year.
Meanwhile, Mr. Reuter says, the giant automotive, aerospace
and electronics concern is halfway toward completing a
cost-cutting program to reduce its annual overhead by 1.5
billion marks ($917 million).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales, however, apparently remain under pressure. Although
Mr. Reuter said first-quarter sales rose by more than 6% over
the year-earlier 17 billion marks ($10.4 billion), the
calculation included sales of the Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm
G.m.b.H. aerospace group, which was acquired late last year.
   In an interview at Daimler-Benz's new headquarters on the
outskirts of Stuttgart, Mr. Reuter elaborated on his vision
of the group as "an integrated transportation company, in
vehicles, railroads and aircraft." He also sees Daimler-Benz
developing into "a major player" in the fields of aerospace,
factory automation and electronics by the end of the decade.
   Earlier this year, Daimler-Benz stunned competitors by
announcing a string of potential alliances. In March, it
tentatively agreed to combine its jet engine operations with
the Pratt &amp; Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp. of the
U.S. A few weeks later, Daimler's Messerschmitt unit agreed
to form a joint venture with the French aerospace group
Aerospatiale S.A. linking their helicopter businesses.
   But it is Daimler-Benz's negotiations with the Mitsubishi
group of Japan that offer the most dazzling possibilities.
Mr. Reuter said no major announcements are expected to come
from the Mitsubishi talks until spring 1991. Ultimately, he
said, he could foresee the possibility of a minor share swap
between, for example, the Mercedes-Benz AG automotive unit
and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. to "underline the common
interests" of the two groups.
   Meantime, the Mitsubishi connection is expected to begin
paying off on at least a modest scale relatively soon. As a
result of a new distribution pact with Mitsubishi Motors, Mr.
Reuter said, Mercedes-Benz already expects "to double our
{car} sales in Japan within three or four years." Mercedes
sold 31,500 cars in Japan last year. Mr. Reuter also hopes to
jointly develop and produce a new generation of all-terrain
vehicles with Mitsubishi.
   But it's aerospace that offers possibilities for the most
capital-intensive alliance between Daimler-Benz and
Mitsubishi, including joint development of a new 75-seat
airliner. Even without alliances, he said, Daimler-Benz is
"quite confident that we have at least begun to set up an
internationally competitive group in aerospace." Mr. Reuter
said, referring to some U.S. fears about the potential
alliance, that such links aren't aimed at anyone, but simply
constitute good global strategy.
   The profit stabilization in Daimler-Benz's passenger-car
business during the first quarter may at least temporarily
halt worries about the company's mainstay automotive unit.
Mr. Reuter confirmed that operating profits from passenger
cars were down almost 30% last year.
   Daimler-Benz's car sales in West Germany dropped last year
to 247,100 from 270,800, while U.S. sales slipped to 75,700
from 83,700. But profitability in the U.S. is improving, he
said, "and this is in a way a little bit of a surprise"
because the top-of-the-line S-Class series is more than 10
years old and due to be replaced by new models next year.

   Chief Justice Rehnquist complains that the federal courts
don't have the time and resources to play much of a role
locking up drug criminals, and one recent case shows why. The
federal courts must now spend time hearing a retrial of a
massive case because prosecutors confused jurors the first
time by throwing in an abusive RICO count. Earlier this year,
federal Judge Robert Aguilar of California was the first
federal judge ever tried as a racketeer, charged with
interceding with other judges to go easy on people he owed
money to. He was also charged with obstructing justice and
conspiracy. A jury couldn't reach a verdict. Jurors might
have figured that what Judge Aguilar allegedly did doesn't
sound very nice, but also doesn't sound much like the Mafia
or "racketeering." This week federal prosecutors dropped the
RICO counts against Judge Aguilar and will bring a case on
the less confusing charges. This sounds to us like progress.

   Schwab Forges Ahead
   As Other Brokers Hesitate

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Charles Schwab &amp; Co. is doing just the
opposite of what most of the rest of the brokerage industry
is doing these days.
   Instead of laying off employees and closing offices, the
nation's largest discount broker is hiring more people and
plans to open 15 new offices in the Midwest and East this
year. Rather than cutting back on services, it is adding
more. Last year alone, it launched 11 new products, including
Second Opinion, which faxes reports by other firms' stock
analysts to Schwab customers on request.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The moves are a bold attempt to gain market share from the
company's discount rivals while repositioning Schwab as a
midsize competitor to the giant Wall Street brokers. "As the
1990s begin, we will make another advance in market share
because of the restructuring of Wall Street," says Charles R.
Schwab, the firm's chairman and founder. "Wall Street has
once more taken a bite out of its own tail."
   Most analysts applaud the strategy and the way Schwab is
executing it. "They are on the leading edge of what the
retail brokerage business will be in the 1990s," says Richard
Ross, a financial services marketing executive at Elrick &amp;
Lavidge, a Chicago market-research firm. "If left alone, they
will own it."
   But a number of Schwab's competitors portray the firm's
expansive game plan as a high-risk gamble during a time when
many individual investors are still shunning the stock
market. "It's dangerous to expand the number of offices to
125 at a time like this," says Jack White, president of Jack
White &amp; Co., a San Diego discount broker.
   With all its new products and services, Schwab isn't
trying to compete as the lowest price discount broker.
Indeed, according to Mercer Inc., a New York firm that tracks
discount commissions, Schwab's average commissions are
slightly higher than those charged by Fidelity Investments'
discount brokerage unit and Quick &amp; Reilly Inc. And they are
almost twice as high as some of the "deep discount" firms.
   Still, Schwab's brokerage commissions are less than half
those at full-service brokers, says Mercer president Mark
Coler. Full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. provide customers with a variety
of services, including stock-market research and a broker who
offers investment advice.
   By offering almost as many services as the full-line firms
but at a cheaper price, Schwab is betting that it can not
only increase the amount of business it does with existing
discount-broker customers, but also snare customers fed up
with the big Wall Street houses.
   "Wall Street sold the public all that garbage," says Mr.
Schwab, referring to junk bonds, no-load mutual funds, unit
trusts and limited partnerships. "They lost sight of the fact
that individuals get angry and won't forget."
   So far, Schwab's blueprint is working. Earnings doubled in
1989, although they slipped 7.5% in the 1990 first quarter.
Contrasted with a collection of weak and battered brokerage
house stocks, Schwab surged to $15 from a low of $6.75 last
year. The stock closed yesterday at $15.75, down 12.5 cents
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   In addition Schwab has strong free cash flow for its
ambitious expansion efforts. Schwab's reported earnings
understate the amount of cash it has available to expand. Mr.
Schwab bought back his company from BankAmerica Corp. in 1987
in a $280 million leveraged buy-out, and the company has
large depreciation and amortization that depress its reported
earnings but don't affect its cash.
   One of Schwab's new growth areas is handling trades for
financial advisers, who now have $3 billion of their
customers' money with Schwab, up from nothing two and a half
years ago. Schwab also is gaining a toehold in the corporate
financial services market by providing 401(k) plans,
stock-option financing and dividend-reinvestment plans for
employees.
   Still, says Mr. Schwab, "The base of the company is the
individual investor."
   The firm offers two different trading systems for
customers with personal computers. Now it is rolling out
nationally its new TeleBroker trading service, which allows
customers to trade and receive stock quotes and account
information with a Touch-Tone phone. Competitors Fidelity
Investments and Quick &amp; Reilly also have computerized
trading, but their systems are less elaborate and they don't
yet offer Touch-Tone trading.
   Schwab also has been building up its assets under
management by selling services such as its Schwab One cash
management accounts, which combine a brokerage account with a
money market account with check-writing privileges and a
credit card.
   Schwab One balances have soared to a record $3 billion.
The firm makes about seven-tenths of a cent on every dollar.
"It's not a big deal individually, but $50 to $100 for each
customer ends up as millions of dollars for the firm," says
Mr. Schwab.
   Schwab's Mutual Fund Marketplace allows customers to
invest in more than 400 no-load and low-load mutual funds,
for a fee. It is becoming a significant revenue contributor,
with $2.1 billion in assets. Of course, that pales besides
Fidelity's huge mutual fund family. Fidelity also offers to
buy other mutual funds for customers, and Jack White also has
a mutual fund trading system.
   Some competitors say all these extras could turn out a
burden if the retail brokerage business constricts even
further. Tom Quick, president of Quick &amp; Reilly, says Schwab
"is involved in building market share at the expense of
profits."
   Doyle Lyons, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., says that
Schwab's stock "could be more vulnerable" than other
brokerage stocks in a downturn because of its increased
expenses from new products and facilities.
   Schwab executives counter such criticism. "We have our
foot on the gas pedal now," says Hugo Quackenbush, senior
vice president, "but we can take it off at any time." In
1988, he says Schwab cut costs drastically reducing its
break-even point from 16,000 trades a day to 8,000 trades.
   Moreover, Schwab is betting that the 1990s won't be a
10-year down cycle for the stock market. Demographics are
moving to favor the investment business and his firm, Mr.
Schwab says. "There'll be an increasingly older population
with more money to invest, and there's a trend toward more
intelligent consumerism."

   WASHINGTON -- Two House members asked the Securities and
Exchange Commission to help create "any necessary legislative
solution" to an appeals court ruling last week that is likely
to hurt the agency's enforcement efforts aimed at insider
trading.
   Reps. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Edward Markey (D.,
Mass.) also asked the agency to brief them on the impact of
the ruling by an appeals court panel, which overturned the
insider-trading conviction of Robert Chestman, a former
Gruntal &amp; Co. broker.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Chestman had been convicted in federal district court
of insider trading in Waldbaum Inc. stock before the company
was acquired by Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. The appeals
court ruling threatened to throw into turmoil the SEC's use
of its Rule 14e-3 in insider-trading cases. The rule makes it
a violation to trade on misappropriated tender-offer
information even if the defendant isn't violating a fiduciary
duty by making the trade.
   The government hasn't decided whether it will appeal the
latest ruling to the full appeals court or the Supreme Court.
   Legislation to restore any authority the SEC may have lost
as a result of the court action could include devising a
statutory definition of insider-trading, something Rep.
Dingell has opposed in the past.

   Heart and blood-pressure diseases caused nearly one
million deaths in 1987, almost as much as all other causes of
death combined. Nearly one-fifth of these people were under
age 65, and 5% were under age 45.

   1954: The heart-lung machine, a mechanical pump that
oxygenates and pumps blood during heart surgery, is
developed, making open-heart surgery possible.

   1962: Intra-aortic balloon pump, which temporarily
increases coronary-artery blood flow, is introduced.
                                                                                                       

   1968: Coronary angiography allows physicians to examine
blood vessels or chambers ofthe heart by tracing the course
of dye that's been injected into the bloodstream.
   -- Bypass surgery improves the blood supply to the heart
by constructing a detour around the blocked part of the
coronary artery using a blood vessel from another part of the
body.

was used for three days before the transplant of a human
heart.

   TOKYO -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange decided tentatively at a
meeting of its general members' committee on Thursday to
lower the commissions it permits brokers to charge on each
stock transaction by an average 7.05%.
   The exchange plans to give its official approval to the
committee's decision at its board meeting slated for next
Tuesday and put the new system into effect on June 4.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An exchange official said the committee decided to act
because the commissions in Japan have become too high in
comparison with those charged in most other countries.
   The planned cut would be smaller than the previous 9.8%
reduction made on Oct. 5, 1987. The official said the
committee wanted to minimize the impact of its action on
brokerage houses, whose earnings have been suffering from
stock plunges since the beginning of this year.
   The cut is likely to hurt future brokerage house earnings,
and the decision was made strictly for the benefit of
investors, according to the official.
   Under the new system, commissions would range from 1.15%
for a transaction of less than 1 million yen ($6,396) to
0.075% for a transaction of more than 1 billion yen.

   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- The semiconductor industry's leading
indicator remained unchanged in April, as semiconductor
orders continued a steady increase.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association said the so-called
book-to-bill ratio for April was 1.09:1, the same as in
March. Both figures are preliminary. A 1.09 rate means that
for every $100 of products shipped, or billed, chip makers
received $109 in new orders, or bookings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rising indicator shows stability in the chip market
instead of the slump many were expecting for 1990, said Doug
Andrey, the chip association's statistics director. "The
great fear was that of a recession, but the figures show a
relatively flat" chip market instead, he said. Bookings tend
to peak in April and May during a flat year, he said, and
fall off in the seasonally slower months.
   Semiconductor billings in April were $1.114 billion, 14.2%
lower than March's $1.298 billion and 10.5% lower than the
year-ago period, when billings were $1.245 billion. Average
monthly orders for the three months ended April 30 were
$1.279 billion, 1% above March's figure of $1.267 billion and
2.7% lower than orders during the year-ago period, which were
$1.315 billion.
   Until April, the book-to-bill ratio rose every month after
skidding to 0.88 in September, the lowest level since 1985.

   Practice Makes Better:
   If You Must Have Heart Surgery, Go To
   A Medical Center That Does a Lot of It

   WHEN SOMETHING needs doing, the saying goes, ask a busy
man to do it. That now looks like particularly good advice
for anyone who needs a repair job done on his heart.
   Numerous studies have been showing that medical centers
doing a lot of heart surgery lose a significantly lower
proportion of patients than ones that aren't nearly as busy.
There are quite a few individual exceptions to this rule, and
doubters -- many from hospitals with poorer records -- argue
that the raw data are incomplete and therefore deceptive. But
overall, the evidence has been too strong to ignore.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So the weight of medical opinion now holds that if
practice can't make perfect where heart surgery is concerned,
it certainly helps a lot -- meaning that, conversely, lack of
it can kill patients who might have lived if they had gone to
busier places. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England
Journal of Medicine, says: "The evidence is clear that
open-heart surgery is better, more efficient and safer in
centers that deal with larger volumes of patients and have
larger staffs and more sophisticated and elaborate
facilities."
   But does this mean that the problem, now that it is
recognized, will quickly fade away? Don't count on it.
   It's true that many lower-rated hospitals are working hard
to upgrade their heart-surgery programs. It's true that some
states, including Florida and Ohio, have reacted to the
findings on surgical volume and mortality by clamping down on
the rapid multiplication of new heart-surgery facilities. But
it's also true that such surgery is an economic lure so
powerful that hospitals find it hard to resist.
   Michael Cadger, a health-care consultant and formerly the
chief financial officer of a hospital, says that profit
margins for bypass surgery -- the most common variety -- can
reach 25% in an industry whose average overall margin is
about 5%. Beyond that, a heart-surgery program enhances a
hospital's status, helping it attract and keep respected
physicians. And it serves as a rainmaker, a base for bringing
in lucrative allied business such as angioplasty.
   This is why hospitals have been opening cardiac-surgery
centers at a pace that defies logic, further splintering the
market for such services and thereby adding to the potential
mortality problem. Between 1984 and 1988, the American
Hospital Association recorded a 23% jump in the number of
hospitals doing such operations, and more have been added
since.
   This growth has been occurring even as it was becoming
ever clearer that too many hospital surgical teams weren't
handling enough cases to hone their skills to the maximum.
The result: "an unnecessary bloodbath," says Sidney Wolfe,
director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group. "The
question is how much longer we can tolerate this."
   The problem is compounded by advances in technology and
technique that make it feasible to operate on older and
sicker patients. This further taxes the skills not only of
the surgeon but also of the entire cardiac surgery team --
nurses, perfusionists, anesthesiologists, and others --
skills that frequently call for split-second timing and the
kind of interconnected reaction by team members that only
reaches perfection with repeated, constant practice.
   But at least 30% of hospitals doing heart surgery are
doing fewer than the 250 bypass operations a year that many
surgeons themselves believe is the optimum. In California, a
third of them do fewer than 150 a year.
   This has led to striking differences in death rates
between hospitals that may sometimes be only blocks apart.
Among Medicare patients, the only group for which national
mortality data are available, 20% of those undergoing heart
surgery die at some hospitals; at others, only 2% do.
   Still, the high-volume hospitals don't always do a lot
better than the low-volume ones. Glendale Memorial Hospital
in Glendale, Calif., for instance, did only 103 heart
surgeries in 1988 but lost just four patients. "I think you
can do a very good job with an average of two or three cases
a week," says John Goodwin, chief of surgery.
   Other doctors and hospital administrators, many from
hospitals with poorer records, argue that the raw statistics
on mortality and patient volume should be discounted because
they don't reflect the condition of patients when they
arrive. They are handling more difficult cases than other
hospitals, these dissenters often argue, and so higher death
rates are predictable.
   But there is little or no statistical backing for such
arguments, and most experts discount them. There's no reason
to believe, they say, that low-volume hospitals get more
difficult cases; if anything, they'd probably see a lower
proportion of them. "A hospital that's doing 50 cases a year
just isn't going to get the complicated ones," says Dr.
Relman of the New England Journal.
   The argument that practice is vital gets extra support
from the extremely high death rate at some hospitals where
heart surgery has been a recent addition. In such places the
surgical teams have had little chance to work together, and
it shows.
   JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Fla., for one, had
disastrous initial results when it began a heart-surgery
program in 1987. Even though the surgeons were supplied under
an arrangement with Michael DeBakey, the renowned cardiac
surgeon from Houston, seven of the first 29 patients died,
for a stunning mortality rate of 23%.
   The hospital shut down the program and brought in new
surgeons. They put the team through extensive mock-up drills
simulating surgery before reopening the program, screened out
higher-risk cases, and virtually lived at the hospital while
the first 20 patients were treated after reopening. The
mortality rate for heart surgery at JFK fell to a respectable
5%.
   Like JFK, other hospitals striving to improve their
heart-surgery results have been referring complicated cases
to better-equipped and more practiced hospitals -- in part to
avoid posting a death rate that might imperil their programs.
   Insurers want to direct patients to the busier,
better-equipped hospitals, too, with cost savings as one
incentive. Not long ago Prudential Insurance Co. began
approaching high-volume hospitals, offering to send them
insured patients in exchange for discounts. Others, including
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and the Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, are either
following suit or looking into the possibility of doing so.

   Pritikin and Me:

   Survives a Week Without

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- After 58 years of sloth and
indulgence, after a few thousand eat-in office lunches of
pizza and stress, after countless couch-potato hours spent
watching other people perspire on television, my time finally
has come. Goodbye to all that. I am going to be one of the
Healthy California People everybody reads about in the new
magazines.
   If my time has come, it is high time. Evil things have
happened to my body. I am overweight. My cholesterol count --
people on the coast talk about their cholesterol as much as
they talk about real-estate prices -- is too high. I am
taking a mild diuretic because my blood pressure is also a
little elevated, and at the end of most days I feel as though
people have been beating me with baseball bats. (Sometimes
they have, figuratively speaking, but that's another story.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So I have been dispatched here to the Pritikin Longevity
Center, by a beach lined with waving palms, to see what can
be done about my carcass and my life style. After the usual
welcoming ceremonials, including the handing over of a large
check, I trudge to my room. There is no bathtub. I like
bathtubs, and for $2,379 a week -- plus $850 for medical fees
-- I had figured on maybe having one.
   It strikes me that this is only the first of many things I
will be deprived of by the Pritikin people, and I begin to
feel like a misbehaving first-grader ordered to sit outside
the principal's office, awaiting a discipline that inflates
in the imagination with every passing minute. Starvation,
exhaustion and badgering will be my lot, I'm sure. After all,
isn't this the Parris Island of the fitness movement?
   If it is, or was, the late Nathan Pritikin -- he committed
suicide five years ago, at age 69, after a long struggle with
lymphoma -- was a drill sergeant. In 1958 doctors told him
his arteries were clogged. Don't exert yourself, they said,
and you just might hang on for quite a while. He thumbed his
nose at them.
   After immersion in studies of nutrition and exercise, he
devised for himself a strenuous program of running and a diet
that was extremely limited in proteins (10% to 15% of
calories) and fats (no more than 10%), and very high in
carbohydrates (75% to 80%), particularly the complex
carbohydrates found in starchy vegetables and whole grains.
It worked for him and others, and the Pritikin program hit
the market.
   It was as tough as he was, requiring a near-fanatical
adherence to the founder's rules. Many foods were banned, and
few restaurants served meals that came close to meeting his
standards. This sometimes left traveling disciples sitting in
their hotel rooms, joylessly masticating bulgar wheat dredged
out of their suitcases, while their peers pigged out on
cholesterol-laden expense-account dinners.
   So I am apprehensive as I go to my first meal at the
center, a brunch. A lover of Haagen-Dazs ice cream and
grilled burgers dripping fat, I know I will get neither here.
The question is what I will get. The answer, at least for the
first day's menu, is a melange of allegedly Mexican food --
never one of my favorites -- some of it employing yolkless
eggs and other distinctly non-Mexican substances.
   I eat it anyway. It's not bad. In fact, it's very good. It
didn't used to be, says fellow guest Burt Braverman, who has
been coming to this center for 12 years (there is another in
Miami). When he first came, he recalls, "I couldn't eat the
food. Nobody knew how to cook the low-fat way then." Nathan
Pritikin, he adds, "even preferred it tasteless."
   Monday is doctor day. I am ripped out of bed at 6:15,
tapped of body fluids, questioned, poked, prodded and worked
out to see at what point I give up. There's good news and bad
news.
   The bad news is that at 6 feet 3 inches, I weigh 228 when
I should weigh 209, my triglycerides -- fatty acids in the
blood -- are above normal, and my cholesterol count of 228 is
way above the 160 the Pritikin people (who are very severe on
this point) shoot for as an upper limit. Also, I am, in
effect, a walking cheeseburger; body fat accounts for 36.4%
of my weight, more than double the desirable percentage.
   The good news is that this walking cheeseburger slam-dunks
the cardiac stress test. Wired to a treadmill and an
electrocardiograph, I go faster and faster at a steepening
incline. "Don't be an idiot]" I tell myself. "The faster you
go now, the faster they'll make you exercise later." But
another voice whispers, "Don't let them beat you," and I push
to my limit.
   I recover quickly, show no abnormalities in heart function
and have performed at 14 METs (metabolic equivalents, a
measure of the body's processing of oxygen). Most people my
age can hit only 7 to 10 METs; trained athletes perform at 18
and above. Feeling a little chesty, I get an exercise
prescription tailored to my needs and swagger off -- to a
treadmill class.
   By this time our group of 90 guests -- some here for a
week, others for 13 days or 26 days -- has suffered a
defection of sorts. Sophie Vavilitis, a New Yorker who came
to be with friends, has inspected the menu and schedule and
found them wanting. She has checked into a nearby hotel,
where she is relishing steak, lamb chops, and buttered
croissants, all forbidden here. No early-morning stretching
exercises for her. "Not my style,"she says.
   By contrast, we who remain will get no fatty foods and
only 3 1/2 ounces of high protein (turkey and fish, no red
meat) all week. This would seem to be dietary masochism of a
high order, but I find it increasingly easy to live by. Meals
are very tasty, fruit and vegetable snacks are abundant and,
except for the high proteins, which are measured out, nobody
stands at my shoulder to limit what I eat.
   Clearly, the center has abandoned the rigidity and
all-or-nothing certitude that marked it when Nathan Pritikin
ran the place, possibly because too many would-be clients
found it too intimidating. Instead of banning whole
categories of food and commanding the ingestion of others,
the Pritikin Lifetime Eating Plan (which we are all supposed
to follow when we leave) now only defines foods with the
labels "go," "caution" and "stop."
   We get only the "go" foods while here, but are allowed
more latitude at home; the measly 3 1/2 ounces of protein,
for example, would be our daily ration there, not our weekly
one, and can include some lean red meat.
   The training schedule begins to settle into a routine by
Tuesday. It begins at 6:35 a.m. with wake-up and stretching
exercises, where I meet Angus Miller, who has a lot to
stretch.
   A 375-pound shop foreman from Calgary, he is chasing a
carrot on a stick held by his boss. The latter has promised
to reimburse him for the cost of 26 days here -- $9,000 plus
air fare -- but only at the rate of $1,000 for every 10
pounds Mr. Miller can lose, here and afterward. (He nicks the
boss for a third of the bill by the time he leaves, and is
delighted that he can touch his toes.)
   The days become a blur of classes -- nutrition, cooking,
"life style," relaxation techniques (my favorite, in which a
good part of the class falls asleep) -- interspersed with
exercise: treadmill and aerobics, both done to a driving
musical beat, individual sessions in the gym, more
stretching, weights, the stationary bicyle, a walk along the
beach. And all the vegetables and fruit you can eat.
   Sweating at the treadmill, Leeds Katzen, a 53-year-old
cataract surgeon from Baltimore, says "fear of dying" propels
him. His father died of coronary disease, so he has been
attending Pritikin sessions for the past six years for the
medical examinations and the reinforcement that the training
gives him.
   About half the people here are repeaters. "It's a
brainwash, but it only lasts so long," says Caroline Aktar,
who has come here all the way from Istanbul for the third
year in a row with her husband, Samih, who is 50. Though he
had a triple bypass in 1986 and his cholesterol remains
worrisome, diet and exercise soon are forgotten when he
returns to Turkey, she complains.
   Even here it is hard not to stray. The fleshpots of Santa
Monica beckon, and, fearful of our weaknesses, most of us
stay in at night. There are taped movies, even live
entertainment; outside, there is the smell of coffee,
cigarettes, and the indescribable aroma wafting from the
golden arches of McDonald's.
   If we resist them, we have our reasons. The primary one:
There is evidence that adherence to a Pritikin-type diet and
exercise program can actually reverse coronary-artery
disease.
   One of the guests, Robert Sherman Jr., was told in 1978
that he needed bypass surgery because some of his coronary
arteries were 70% to 90% closed. He came to the center
instead. Once on the program, he recalls, "I knew within two
weeks I was better. I felt alive." He never had the surgery.
Now, at the age of 74, he has come back here with his
41-year-old son, Robert.
   When I check out of the center, I have some idea of what
he means. I have no miracles to show for my week here. My
blood pressure is only marginally improved, to 140/80 from
140/90, and I continue on my diuretic. I have lost only seven
pounds, though I certainly wasn't starving myself. My
cholesterol count, at 219, hasn't improved sharply from 228
going in.
   But my triglycerides have plummeted to a normal 114 from
an over-the-top 163, I have whacked a full two inches off an
expanding gut, and I feel better and more energetic than I
have in years. Returning to a world full of pizza and stress,
I can't guarantee that I can continue to follow the Pritikin
Way for the rest of my life. But I want to. And so far, with
only moderate cheating, I have.

   NEW YORK -- The over-the-counter market ended on its highs
for the day, encouraged by a successful conclusion to the
Treasury Department's quarterly refunding.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed steadily through the
session, closing up 1.86, or 0.43%, to 433.20. The New York
Stock Exchange added 0.35% for the day.

   Traders say the OTC market grew stronger as yields in the
bond market eased.
   Lance Zipper, manager of the OTC trading department at
Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., says his trading desk has seen more
action in the past few days than it has in the past few
months. Most of that activity has been on the buy side, he
adds.
   "The orders around now are much, much larger than they
were a month ago," Mr. Zipper says. "The liquidity in our
market seems to be building up."
   Mr. Zipper says the activity is spreading to smaller
unlisted stocks that have been largely ignored by investors
for some time.
   Sun Microsystems led the most-active list, easing 1/4 to
28 1/8 in apparent profittaking on volume of more than 4.4
million shares. The stock surged 2 1/2 points Wednesday on
volume of more than 5 million shares.
   Meanwhile, Nordstrom continued to trade after the market
closed, sliding on disappointing earnings. At about 4 p.m.
EDT, the company reported profit of 16 cents a share in the
latest first quarter, down from 28 cents a year earlier.
Analysts had expected the company to earn around 27 cents a
share in the quarter, according to Zacks Corporate Earnings
Estimator.
   The stock eased 1/4 to 27 3/4 during yesterday's session.
But Jerry Markowitz, partner in charge of OTC trading at
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, says the stock fell
to about 26 1/4 in after market trading on the Instinet
automated trading system.
   OTC advancers led decliners, 1,037 to 844. National Market
System volume rose to 104,329,800 shares from Wednesday's
99,273,600 shares.
   Apple Computer fell 1/2 to 41 3/8. This newspaper reported
yesterday that the Macintosh System 7, a software upgrade to
Apple's Macintosh that was originally slated for a summer
debut, now won't be ready until year end.
   Also on the most-active list, Hornbeck Offshore Services
added 1/2 to 7 7/8. A 3.21 million share secondary offering
was priced late Wednesday at $7.25 a share.
   L.M. Ericsson Telephone's American Depositary Receipts
added 6 3/8 from Wednesday's close to 177 1/8, after opening
trading here at 176. Yesterday, L.M. Ericsson announced an
$89 million order for fighter aircraft equipment in Europe.
Earlier this week, the Swedish telecommunications giant
reported that first quarter pretax income nearly doubled. The
company has also approved a 5-for-1 stock split.
   Durham gained 2 1/4 to 32. The diversified insurance
company earned 29 cents a share in its latest first quarter,
up from 18 cents in continuing operation profit a year
earlier.
   Genetics Institute dropped 1 3/8 to 35 5/8. The company
said its 1990 revenue will be about $5 million lower than
previously expected because of Wellcome Foundation's decision
to cancel its heart-attack drug development project. The
company said its 1990 revenue had been expected to total
about $50 million. Wellcome had been developing two
clot-dissolving drugs for Genetics Institute. Last month,
however, rival Genentech won a patent-infringement suit
against the two companies over the heart-attack drugs. The
company had revenue of $43.6 million in fiscal 1989, ended in
November.
   Nuclear Support Services tumbled 1 to 9 1/4 after
reporting a fiscal second quarter loss of 39 cents a share.
The company, which provides technical support personnel for
nuclear power plants, earned 11 cents a share in the
year-earlier quarter.
   ACC jumped another 1 1/4 to 11 5/8 yesterday after rising
7/8 Wednesday, giving it a 25% gain in two days. The company
has been on a road show talking to institutional investors
about its opportunities in the Canadian long-distance market.
Recent rulings in Canada have opened that $2 billion-plus
market to long-distance resellers. Rochester, N.Y.-based ACC
believes it is in a position to participate in the market
because of its proximity to the Canadian border.
   Seagate Technology added 1/2 to 12 3/4 on heavy volume.
The company said a patent-infringement case filed against it
by Atasi Corp. in 1984 has been dismissed.
   Cellular gained 1 1/4 to 14 1/4. The company offered $40
million of 8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2000 in
Europe. The conversion price on the debentures will be $14.95
a share, the company said.
   New Mexico's Sunwest Financial lost 1 1/4 to 18 1/4.
Wednesday, the company said it recorded additions to
loan-loss reserves and write-downs totaling $2.6 million due
to a regulatory examination last month. The bank holding
company said it expects additional adjustments as bank
examiners continue to look at its books.
   Michigan National lost 1 to 36 1/4. The bank holding
company said it is slowing the pace of its stock-repurchase
program. The company also said its non-performing loans have
increased from $96 million to $139 million.

   SUNWEST FINANCIAL SERVICES Inc. said it recorded additions
to loan-loss reserves and other charges totaling $7 million
due to a continuing regulatory exam, leaving the company with
net income of $2.1 million for the four-month period ended
April 30. The total for the charges was misstated in Friday's

   American Savings
   Bank Liquidates
   Its Junk Portfolio

   American Savings Bank acknowledged that it had liquidated
its $400 million junkbond portfolio since the end of 1989,
concluding an embarrassing episode that may have cost the
otherwise healthy thrift $100 million or more.
   American, which was acquired in December 1988 by Texas
financier Robert Bass with government assistance, went on a
Texas-size buying spree for junk bonds last spring and
summer, only to have Congress ban thrift ownership of the
bonds as part of the thrift bailout law in August. At its
peak, American's portfolio totaled about $493 million, making
it one of the top 10 thrift holders of junk.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This was probably the most ill-timed major junk-bond
ventures of anybody I could remember. The timing could not
have been worse," said Kenneth Thomas, a Miami thrift analyst
and consultant.
   A spokesman for American, based in Stockton, Calif., said
the portfolio had all been sold by the end of April. He
declined to estimate the financial effect of the sales and
had no further comment.
   In February, American disclosed that it set aside $65
million in reserves for junk-bond losses in the fourth
quarter and said its junk-bond holdings at year end had been
reduced to $400 million.
   A person close to American said there was "some additional
loss, though not huge numbers" subsequent to year end. The
person said American "did better than most" in selling its
bonds but still suffered.
   "Obviously, in hindsight, everybody would have preferred
to invest in something better," the person said.
   Mr. Thomas, the analyst, estimated that losses totaled in
the range of $125 million, or about 25% of the portfolio at
its peak, based on prevailing market prices for junk in
recent months.
   The episode is more of a public-relations disaster than a
financial one for American, whose 1989 financial results made
it the most profitable large thrift in the country. American
had about $16.3 billion in assets at year end. The losses
could also spark new criticism of regulators for permitting
the junk-bond purchases after the 1988 rescue, analysts said.
   "This was clearly their most dramatic mistake so far as
their investment in that bank," Mr. Thomas said of the Bass
family stake in American. "Everything else seems to have gone
very well. They are fortunate they have the capital strength
to get out of it."
   Most large thrifts who took the plunge on junk bonds
haven't been so lucky, with many having failed or in imminent
danger of doing so. The largest thrift purchaser, Columbia
Savings &amp; Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif., which
once held roughly $4.5 billion in junk, is currently
insolvent and is considered a federal takeover candidate.

   Pru-Bache Tops Big Firms in First-Quarter Stock Picks

   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. moved to the head of the
class in stock picking for the first quarter. But Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. widened its long-term lead in a quarterly study
designed to gauge how individual investors would do if they
followed their brokers' advice.
   Investors who bought the stocks recommended by Pru-Bache,
a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, eked out an
estimated profit of 0.6% for the quarter, according to the
joint study by this newspaper and Zacks Investment Research
Inc. of Chicago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   People who invested in Goldman's favorites roughly broke
even for the quarter, while those who bought the picks of
eight other major brokerage houses suffered minor losses (as
did the market averages). To estimate the returns of
individual investors, the study assumes that a person holds,
in equal amounts, each stock highly recommended by a
particular brokerage house.
   The results show how a hot hand can change quickly. In 15
quarters covered by the study, seven different firms have
come out on top for at least one quarter. Pru-Bache was tops
in stock picking for the first quarter of 1987, as well as
the latest quarter, but has done poorly long-term, ranking
10th for the full 45 months.
   Long-term, the study's champion is Goldman Sachs, with an
estimated return of 82.1% for the 45 months through March.
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., a unit of Primerica Corp.,
captured the 12-month crown for the fifth time in a row.
   Here's a rundown on how the stocks recommended by the 10
brokerage houses have done, and what sorts of stocks the
firms favor now. The firms are discussed in order of 12-month
performance.
   SMITH BARNEY: With an estimated return of 30.7%, Smith
Barney trounced the competition for the latest 12 months. But
it stumbled in the first quarter, mostly by recommending
Hilton Hotels Corp., which slid 34% as takeover talk fizzled.
Smith Barney had been breathing down the neck of Goldman
Sachs for the long-term lead, but an estimated quarterly loss
of 3.3% leaves it seven percentage points behind. What now?
"We're making a big bet on the technology stocks," says
research director Alan Benasuli. "IBM and Digital Equipment .
. . were the underperformers of the 1980s, and we think
they're going to be the leaders of the 1990s." He's also keen
on such oil stocks as Mobil Corp., Oryx Energy Co. and Texaco
Inc.
   GOLDMAN SACHS: While the overall market dropped about 3%
in the first quarter, Goldman's Focus List stocks were
essentially unchanged, helping the firm strengthen its grip
on first place in the long-term standings. Its biggest winner
lately has been Maxtor Corp., a San Jose, Calif., maker of
computer disk drives, which was up 35% for the quarter.
William Kealy, research director, says the firm is sticking
for now with a fairly heavy weight on technology and
capital-goods stocks. But he says it may go to more defensive
issues (those with low price-earnings ratios and high
dividends) if it looks like the economy will be weak in 1991.
   SHEARSON: The stock pickers at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
have been getting more defensive. "We're in a trading-range
market," says research director Fred Fraenkel. As a result,
he says, the firm's analysts and stock-selection committee
have been actively pruning, trying to make sure "that we
don't keep things on the list that may be risky." In January,
a nasty month for stocks, the American Express Co. unit's
recommended list had the third-smallest drop (6.4%, vs. 6.3%
for Smith Barney and A.G. Edwards). For the quarter, Shearson
was No. 4, as losses in issues like Bairnco Corp. (down 45%)
and Time Warner Inc. (down 21%) canceled out gains in such
stocks as Nike Inc. (up 35%) and Amgen (up 26%).
   DEAN WITTER: Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a unit of Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co., ranked fourth for the latest 12 months, but
last for the quarter. "We got hurt with bank stocks" and
other interest-sensitive issues, observes research director
Manny Korman. Those included Citicorp. (down 19% for the
quarter), First Chicago (down 17%) and American Express (down
26%). Nevertheless, Mr. Korman thinks investors should stick
with interest-sensitive stocks. The reason: "The market can't
go . . . unless you get a break in interest rates." He also
likes food, drug and beverage stocks, on the theory that the
economy is likely to stay "sluggish" for quite a while.
   MERRILL LYNCH: Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. trailed the market
averages by a tad last quarter. "I guess we benefited
somewhat from an emphasis on technology," says research
director Andrew Melnick, "but we were hurt by financials,
banks and HMOs." Health maintenance organizations have given
Merrill some big gains in the past, but "they're a volatile
group," Mr. Melnick notes. "You live by the sword, you die by
the sword." Merrill clients made profits last quarter in
Landmark Graphics Corp. (up 30%) and OEA Inc. (up 29%), but
those who bought Prime Motor Inns Inc. (down 50%) and J&amp;J
Snack Food Corp. (down 30%) aren't smiling.
   KIDDER PEABODY: Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a unit of General
Electric Co., beat the market averages with an estimated 2.2%
loss last quarter. For both 12 months and 45 months, it ranks
sixth. Stefan Abrams, chief investment strategist, likes
consumer-product "noncyclicals" -- companies whose fortunes
aren't closely tied to the ups and downs of the economy, such
as Procter &amp; Gamble or Bristol Myers. He also favors
technology stocks -- not only computers (IBM, Digital
Equipment, Intel) but also biotechnology and
pollution-control issues. Technology stocks, he says, may be
a bit risky, but "cost cutting and product cycles are falling
into place" and will result in "much more explosive results
in the next couple of years."
   PAINEWEBBER: Suffering more from an absence of big winners
than from any awful losers, the PaineWebber Group Inc. unit
PaineWebber Inc. slipped a notch to seventh in the 12-month
standings. The firm's list is "eclectic," says research
director James Voytko. It has some oil issues like British
Petroleum Co. and Texaco; quite a few telecommunications
stocks and drug stocks; and some "soft cyclicals" like
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing. For the daring, Mr. Voytko
suggests a depressed advertising stock, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
PLC. The mixture reflects what strategist Edward M. Kerschner
calls an "Andy Warhol market" -- each stock group has its
brief moment of fame.
   PRUDENTIAL-BACHE: A good quarter raised Pru-Bache to
eighth in the 12-month standings. Long-term it remains last,
but the four bottom firms are within about two percentage
points of each other. Last quarter it had gains exceeding 30%
in Anthem Electronics Inc., Home Depot Inc. and New England
Critical Care Inc., while suffering one big loss (First
Executive Corp., down 65%). "We still like technology stocks,
even though they have performed well in the first quarter,"
says research director Michael Culp. Among the firm's current
technology picks: Anthem, Chips &amp; Technologies Inc., Lotus
Development Corp. and Silicon Graphics Inc.
   A.G. EDWARDS: Like Dean Witter, A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
was hurt by the poor performance of interest-sensitive
stocks, as interest rates rose in the first quarter. At
Edwards, utility stocks are an important part of the list.
Research director Terry Dessent says investors shouldn't
abandon utilities and bank stocks, which he says have
"excellent total-return opportunities." They've "been beat up
pretty badly," he says. "We certainly want to buy them when
nobody wants them." He also likes selected technology stocks.
   RAYMOND JAMES: Wham] Bam] Raymond James customers get lots
of action: The St. Petersburg, Fla., unit of Raymond James
Financial Inc. has done great picking stocks in up markets,
but badly in down ones. For example, the stocks it
recommended had the study's worst performance in January
(down 14.2%) and the best performance in February and March
(up 12.3%). That's the result of a list devoid of such staid
groups as utilities, foods and beverages (Raymond James
doesn't cover them), and heavy on small stocks and Southeast
regional firms. Research director David Henwood says he's
looking to add some bigger stocks to give the list stability;
he believes corporate earnings and interest rates will
continue to be worrisome.

   Telltale Heart:
   PET Scanners Seem to Represent
   A Major Advance in Screening
   For Heart Disease; So Why
   Aren't They Used More?

   THE HEART IS an unreliable sentinel, so silent that no
diagnostic tool can safely and reliably screen it for
disease. As many as 60% of the more than one million
heart-attack victims each year have no warning that they are
sick.
   But imagine a new machine, a breakthrough in diagnosing
heart disease. It would be highly reliable. It wouldn't
require surgery or other invasive procedures. The test would
tell doctors who has coronary disease and who hasn't, how
sick victims are, and what the best treatment methods may be.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to many cardiologists, such a tool exists. A
test using positron emissions tomography, or PET, scanners,
they say, could radically alter the attack on heart disease.
   So what's the problem?
   Plenty. The PET test faces an enormous battle as it works
its way through the labyrinth of medical economics and
government approvals. Heated disputes among cardiologists
also may slow the process -- as may fights among
manufacturers. "We could be saving a lot of lives," says K.
Lance Gould, a cardiologist at the University of Texas
Medical Center and a leading proponent of the use of PET
scanning. "But things move a lot slower than you might
think."
   Although the basic technology for PET scans has existed
for more than 20 years, it only recently has begun to gain
credibility as a valuable diagnostic tool for cardiologists.
Many heart doctors still don't even know it exists.
   PET scanners are large, doughnut-shaped machines that take
three-dimensional photographs of blood as it flows through
the heart. During the test, a doctor gives a patient an
intravenous injection of a radioactive tracer. As the tracer
decays, it emits positrons that are picked up by the scanner
and transformed by a computer into vivid color pictures of
the heart.
   PET scans allow doctors to precisely measure the metabolic
activity of the heart muscle in addition to the quality of
blood flow through each of the heart's four chambers. The
test is conducted first with the heart at rest and then under
stressed conditions -- using a drug that simulates exercise.
This gives doctors before-and-after pictures that allow them
to assess damage to heart muscles as well as to determine
whether blood flow is being impaired by atherosclerosis. By
being able to see exactly what part of the heart is affected,
doctors can also figure out which arteries are obstructed and
by how much.
   Currently, the only procedure that exceeds the PET scan in
reliability is coronary angiography. Angiography provides
doctors with vivid X-ray pictures of clogged arteries, but
because it is an invasive procedure that requires snaking a
catheter through the body, it also carries much higher risk.
As a result, angiography is used only with patients who have
already had heart attacks or are deemed to be at extremely
high risk. Another widely used test, the thallium scan, has a
lower accuracy rate than PET and isn't popular as a screening
device for patients who don't have obvious cardiac-disease
symptoms.
   PET scans, on the other hand, carry virtually no risk and
are highly accurate -- replicating the results of angiography
as much as 98% of the time. They also cost roughly half as
much as a $3,500 angiogram.
   "The PET scan has significant potential," says John
Mazziotta, professor of neurology and radiology at the UCLA
School of Medicine. He notes that, in many diseases, the
earliest changes in the body are biochemical. Since this is
what the PET scan sees, "the ideal way to use this is in
detecting disease before people develop symptoms," he says.
PET scans also are accurate in measuring the progress of
patients who have had bypass operations or other treatments
for heart disease, as well as in evaluating candidates for
such procedures.
   But it is the potential for early detection of heart
disease that offers the most exciting benefits -- both in
terms of saving lives and in reducing the enormous expense
associated with treating people who have heart attacks. The
American Heart Association estimates that the annual cost of
cardiovascular disease -- including medical and nursing care
and lost productivity -- totals $94.5 billion.
   Yet as promising as it is, the PET scan faces an uphill
battle in winning acceptance. One of its biggest hurdles is
the Catch-22 of medical economics. With only 50 working
scanners in the U.S., many of them built experimentally, the
procedure is expensive -- costing about $1,800 per test.
Though much cheaper than angiography, that is substantially
more than other current screening devices, such as the
treadmill stress test.
   Even though wider application could substantially reduce
the cost of PET scans -- some proponents believe a $600 price
is attainable -- neither the government nor insurance
companies will reimburse PET tests at current levels. That
leaves hospitals to take a risk few are willing to chance:
buy the scanner now in hopes that reimbursement will occur
down the road.
   "The current state of medical economics dictates that
government and insurance companies be more conservative than
they've been in the past," says Landis Griffeth, assistant
professor at Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington
University in St. Louis. At the same time, he adds:
"Hospitals have to be fiscally realistic. They can go broke
setting up something they're not going to get paid for."
   The proponents of PET technology also have a running feud
with other doctors. Many cardiologists resist PET tests
because they stand to lose economically if the test supplants
current stress tests. That's because PET tests would probably
be done at major medical centers -- in contrast to stress
tests, which can be done in doctors' offices and are thus a
major source of revenue in private practices.
   "This is basically a nasty catfight," says J. Michael
McGehee, executive director of the Institute for Clinical
PET, which is based in Washington, D.C., and set up mostly to
lobby the government on behalf of PET. "You have thousands of
cardiologists every day doing thousands of stress tests.
{Some proponents of PET} would stop that. They are advocating
taking this away from the cardiologists."
   Even the manufacturers of PET scanners are squabbling
among themselves. Some of the equipment only works well with
radioactive tracers produced by huge -- and expensive --
cyclotrons. The manufacturers who make these scanners,
including Siemens Corp. and General Electric Co., generally
favor more specialized use of PET scanners in heart
applications.
   Because their scanners work better in some brain-related
applications, they also are promoting PET for that purpose.
   But other scanners, made by Positron Corp. of Houston, use
a radioactive tracer called rubidium. These don't work well
for scanning the brain, but rubidium can be produced in a
small machine about the size of a briefcase -- avoiding the
need for a $3 million cyclotron. (The briefcase-sized
machines are made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) The proponents
of these scanners contend that PET should be widely used as a
screening device for heart disease.
   This latter group is currently losing the battle. The
government is considering only whether to approve
reimbursements for PET scans in certain limited applications
-- some involving the heart and others involving the brain.
   The proposal before the government's Health Care Financing
Administration has been sent to a physicians' panel that
evaluates new health technology. It will then go to the
Public Health Service's Office of Health Technology
Assessment. Final approval isn't likely until next year, at
the earliest.
   Nevertheless, the supporters of wider use for PET remain
optimistic. "The medical establishment aside, we believe
there is tremendous demand out there for this sort of test,"
says Dr. Gould of the University of Texas. "It's there among
highstress executives who want to know if they are at risk,
it's {there among} people who have had heart problems treated
and want to know how they are progressing, it's {there among}
the population at large. There's tremendous fear and concern
among people about their hearts. New technologies like the
PET test can either give you peace of mind because you find
out you don't have the disease, or tell you for sure that
you've got a problem and you need to take steps to reverse
the problem. Either way, you win."

   China Frees 211 Prisoners in Move Seen Aimed
   At Retaining Most-Favored Nation Trade Status

   BEIJING -- China announced the release of 211 prisoners,
including several prominent intellectuals, who were arrested
after the suppression of last year's pro-democracy movement.
   The freeing of the "lawbreakers," the second such mass
release in four months, doesn't necessarily signify a
softening of China's hard-line attitude toward dissent.
Instead, diplomats and Chinese intellectuals say, the move
seems aimed at improving China's image abroad and, in
particular, derailing U.S. lawmakers' efforts to take away
China's most-favored nation trade status.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Our leaders had one thing in mind: the {most-favored
nation} clause," said a Chinese scholar.
   Western diplomats in Beijing say they doubt the move will
have much effect on U.S.-China trade deliberations in
Washington, even in light of China's decision last week to
lift martial law in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa.
   "Releasing these people is a step in the right direction,"
said one Western diplomat. "But China hasn't gone far enough
to allay the concerns that the U.S. has expressed since last
June."
   In Washington, top White House officials say Mr. Bush
hasn't made a decision about whether to extend China's
most-favored nation status. Officials suggest that Mr. Bush
may wait until close to the June 3 deadline before disclosing
his decision.
   If Mr. Bush does extend the special trade status, a tough
battle lies ahead for China's opponents on Capitol Hill.
Under U.S. law, if Congress passes a resolution revoking
China's most-favored nation status, the president can veto
the measure. Lawmakers then would have to muster a two-thirds
majority to override the veto. Congressional staffers who
follow this issue say it could be difficult to win two-thirds
support to override the president.
   U.S. business groups representing companies that import
goods from China already are pressing the case for continuing
China's most-favored nation status by warning that revocation
would mean a loss of American jobs and higher prices. And Sir
David Wilson, governor of Hong Kong, has written letters to
key Democrats and Republicans in both houses of Congress
warning that withdrawal of China's most-favored nation status
would be a "severe blow" to the British colony, a major
trading partner of the U.S. and China, Reuters news agency
reported.
   If the most-favored nation status were to be withdrawn,
many of China's exports -- one quarter of which go to the
U.S. -- would become uncompetitive in U.S. markets. President
Bush has until June 3 to make his recommendation, after which
Congress will vote on the matter.
   Domestically, the release of several well-known dissidents
may help to ease tension somewhat as Beijing tries to avert
possible unrest on June 3-4, the anniversary of last year's
massacre. China's leaders also have attempted to reassure the
nation's disaffected intellectuals recently with speeches
that have adopted a more tolerant and conciliatory tone.
   With the release of the 211 prisoners, which was announced
by the official Xinhua news agency Thursday, China now says
it has freed a total of 784 people arrested in connection
with last year's demonstrations. Beijing's public security
departments are still investigating a further 431 people,
Xinhua said, adding that an unspecified number of additional
cases are being handled by China's judicial organs.
   The statistics don't include the hundreds believed to have
been arrested outside of Beijing last year, after
anti-government demonstrations spread to dozens of cities
around the country.
   The Xinhua report implied that those released had all
confessed their wrongdoing and shown repentance. It wasn't
possible to immediately confirm this with the released
dissidents.
   Among those freed, the best-known is Dai Qing, a
muckraking journalist for the mass-circulation Guangming
Daily. Despite close connections to the family of the late
revolutionary hero Ye Jianying, the outspoken 44-year-old Ms.
Dai has long been a thorn in the side to China's conservative
Communist Party leaders.
   Ms. Dai appeared to play a very small role during last
year's student movement. At one point, she made a speech to
students staging a hunger strike at Tiananmen Square. But in
that speech, she urged students to end the strike and return
to campus. Given this, many observers believe she was jailed
as part of a mass sweep of liberal intellectuals, rather than
for any specific wrongdoing related to last year's movement.
   Another prominent intellectual released this week is Cao
Siyuan, who had been director of the Sitong Social
Development Research Institute, a think tank funded by the
semiprivate Stone computer group. Mr. Cao is one of China's
top legal minds, and drafted the nation's first bankruptcy
law. Mr. Cao was arrested last year for his role in proposing
a legal challenge to the declaration of martial law in
Beijing on May 20, two weeks before the massacre.
   A number of well-known dissidents are thought to remain in
prison, facing possible trial and long-term incarceration.
They include Wang Dan, a student leader at Beijing
University; Bao Tong, former chief aide to disgraced party
chief Zhao Ziyang; Liu Xiaobo, an intellectual who advised
student protesters at Tiananmen; and Ren Wanding, a longtime
dissident who was arrested for the first time during China's
Democracy Wall movement of 1978.

   The President
   Sniffs Out
   A Budget Deal

   If you want to draw snickers in the Beltway, just mention
the words "budget reform." For genuine belly laughs, say
"line-item veto." The cognoscenti sniff that it'll "never
happen." Otherwise curious reporters roll their eyes.
   Yet if they're right, why are White House aides
backgrounding that the power to veto individual budget items
is something George Bush really wants? And why has the Senate
Judiciary Committee -- the Joe Biden-Ted Kennedy committee --
passed a line-item veto for the first time in 106 years?
Could "budget reform" be the lynchpin of George Bush's
tax-and-spend summit with Congress? As Mr. Bush likes to say,
let's "read the tea leaves."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For openers, why would a president with a 70% approval
rating suddenly give up his main lever over Congress -- taxes
-- if he doesn't want anything in return? Don't believe the
new White House line about a "budget emergency." (This is
known as "crying Stockman," after the former budget director
who always predicted doom to pressure Congress.) The economy
has actually been healthier of late, and the budget numbers
aren't all that bad. Something else is going on.
   George Bush also happened to be in town during the 1980s
for previous budget "summits." He remembers the 1982 accord's
spending cuts that never happened, and 1987's
sweep-it-under-the-rug accord. To believe a Bush "sellout" on
taxes you have to believe that he, Chief of Staff John Sununu
and Treasury Secretary Nick Brady are stupid enough to give
up their party's best political issue without solving the
budget problem. Only the White House press corps could really
believe this.
   So the $1.2-trillion question is, what does George want? A
capital gains tax cut and spending cuts, sure, but the big
enchilada would be budget reform. Without what former budget
director Jim Miller calls "an enforcement mechanism" in the
process, spending promises from Congress are as worthless as
rubles. The same old game will continue. If George Bush
didn't know this, why would he endorse hardballers Newt
Gingrich and Phil Gramm as the GOP's lead summit negotiators
from Congress?
   Even Dick Darman, the budget director and Beltway
gamesman, is saying how much he wants budget reform. He was
livid at a jibe in this paper's editorial columns that he
doesn't favor the item veto. ("Get rid of those sources,"
said Charmin' Darman.)
   Mr. Darman says he likes the item veto, but it isn't
enough. He'd also like a second "sequester," or the automatic
Gramm-Rudman sword that now strikes the budget once each
year. He wants a second sword to fall six months after the
first. Another priority is "credit reform," especially a cap
on federal guarantees for private borrowing. With federal
liabilities running into the trillions of dollars (think S&amp;L
bailout), he's right.
   As for the item veto, Mr. Darman's caveat is an old one,
that it wouldn't apply to "mandatory programs," the 50% of
the budget (such as Medicare) automatically spent each year.
But as savvy a player as Mr. Darman should know that simply
getting the president back in the budget game would change
the politics of spending. It would force a better debate
between what is legitimate and what is pork.
   That still leaves Congress, but even there the tea leaves
are turning. Senate Judiciary support for the item veto
included liberals Paul Simon of Illinois and Howell Heflin of
Alabama. Sens. Kennedy and Biden voted against the
constitutional amendment, but offered their own statutory
item-veto.
   "I think it's worked well in the states," said Mr.
Kennedy, hardly an anti-spending hawk. "I was opposed . . .
when I first came to the Senate, but I do think that the
item-veto is necessary in order to get accountability."
   Perhaps this is opportunism, but that's the point. If
liberals are climbing on board, the politics of budget reform
may have changed. Sen. Alan Dixon, the Illinois Democrat
who's followed the issue for years, now says, "the item veto
hasn't been sold right. It's always been sold as a partisan
issue. But I know plenty of moderate Democrats and economic
liberals who see the need for this."
   If President Bush makes reform a priority, Mr. Dixon says,
he now has a real chance to get it. And even if it won't fly
as a constitutional amendment, everyone could compromise on a
statutory type of item-veto known as "enhanced rescission." A
version sponsored by Sen. Dan Coats (R., Ind.) last year got
40 votes -- despite the presence of West Virginia's Robert
Byrd, standing like a bouncer in the well of the Senate
watching every vote. Mr. Byrd hates the item-veto because it
would crimp his pork-barrel power as chairman of
appropriations.
   Any accord is still a long shot, as this week's uproar
over taxes showed. My own heart's with the anti-taxers, with
the Vin Webers and Lynn Martins urging Mr. Bush to keep his
no-new-tax pledge. My head says the chance to bring some
long-term sanity to federal budgeting is at least worth
negotiating. Marginal income tax rates, the main supply-side
insight, shouldn't be touched. And certainly any agreement
without real budget reform would be a sellout, as even
administration officials privately admit. But there's no
reason Mr. Bush can't walk away, no-new-taxes intact, if he
ends up bargaining with himself.
   President Bush has shown he's able to reshuffle the
political cards in a surprising way before (Nicaragua,
capital gains). The old Reagan-era partisan divisions don't
always prevail anymore. What Democrats would never concede to
the Great Communicator, they just might to their fellow
insider.

   Aerobics for the Inert:
   A Busy Schedule Provides Plenty of Opportunities
   To Help the Heart; Seize the Moments]

   AH, THE HEART. Can't live without it. Yet how most of us
abuse it] This is especially true of office-bound middle
managers who go from bed to train to desk to home again, with
nary a thought of how our poor ticker is expected to carry
the strain.
   Now, thanks to advancements in exercise science, it is
possible to make the most of your busy schedule -- and keep
your pump in superb working shape at the same time] How? By
using the same workout principles practiced by shapely
dancers and narcissistic California beefcakes. We're talking
aerobics] And we're talking now]
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yes, at every point in your working day, opportunities for
cardiac maintenance abound if you seize upon them. Consider.
                                                                                                       

   WAKE-UP WARM-UP: Fitness is a state of mind that you can
invoke from the moment you pop open your orbs. Make sure to
set the alarm at least 30 minutes too early for human
civilization. As the buzzing, beeping or ringing assaults
you, allow a flood of fears and anxieties attached to the
coming 12 hours to overwhelm your consciousness.
   Got a huge presentation before a cadre of unfriendly
securities analysts at noon? A performance review at 3? Feel
the weight of the impending business day press down upon you.
Feel your heart pounding. You haven't even gotten out of bed
yet] Now lift the entire mass of your schedule onto your
spirit and hit the shower] Make it a cold one] Use a rough
towel] You're in the aerobic swing now]
                                                                                                       

   LIMBERING IN TRANSIT: Be sure to prepare before engaging
in any serious jumping and stumping. As you place your coat
on the overhead rack on the train, make sure to reach as far
as you can over the people sitting on the inner seats. If, on
the other hand, you are forced to stand, stretch your legs
and don't forget to use your elbows to shove other people
away from you.
                                                                                                       

   RUNNING WITH WEIGHTS: As you leave the bus or train, run
with your briefcase clutched to your chest. While you are
doing so, keep your mind on what will happen if you are late
for your morning muffin with the controller one more time.
Wow] What a surge of cardiac activity] This exercise is most
effective for attorneys and financial officers, whose
briefcases often resemble steamer trunks. Stretch and firm]
Bend and wheeze] Extend your life by moments]
                                                                                                       

   CONTINUOUS ACTION: As any aerobic philosopher will tell
you, sporadic movement is worthless. The body must be prodded
into sustained activity of sufficient duration to keep your
pulse rate pumping at a frenzy. That's good news for many
middle managers who spend their day in constant motion --
shifting from foot to foot outside offices, bolting back to
make a brief appointment, fleeing across town for something
that your former support staff used to do and then hustling
back to the office for a three-floor search for the computer
consultant who's supposed to fix the hard drive.
   So while you're hurtling hither and yon, feel good about
yourself. You're doing more for your ticker than the skinny
Mr. Universe types who come back after a lunchtime workout
with their hair slicked back and their faces a sanguine shade
of purple. And while you're darting around, take your heart
rate, like so: Place any two fingers (not your thumb) on the
throbbing vein just underneath your jaw. If it's doing the
Lambada, congratulations] You're alive]
                                                                                                       

   USE EVERY MOMENT: Anyone who has studied the video
literature knows that the best aerobic exercise involves some
sort of limb pumping. Now here's the good news: Recent
discoveries indicate that your arms may be pumped in and out
during most normal business phone calls.
   First, figure out whether the conversation is a typical
one -- that is, 40% meat and 60% air. If it is, then begin as
follows: Extend whichever arm is holding the receiver well
away from your ear during those times when you feel it's safe
to do so. After a while, return the receiver to your ear and
check things out. When it once again seems appropriate,
forcefully pump your arm outward again. Repeat until
conversation is ended. Feel good? It should. You're not only
building muscle. You're building sanity]
                                                                                                       

   EAT TO LIVE, LIVE TO EAT: My wife's aerobics teacher
passed along a theory I find immensely attractive: Your body
uses more calories to digest broccoli than lettuce. I'm not
about to find out whether that's true. I assume it is. And
the implications are enormous. If your poor body must labor
mightily to digest indigestible greenstuffs, think how
difficult it must be for your system to process a bag of
greasy burgers and french fries? What a chore] Better still,
food ingested at warp speed must tax the body system even
more. The goal here, then, for maximum aerobic value, must be
to gobble hard-to-digest food really fast. So opt for that
liver smothered in onions and a half-bottle of petulant
Mersault. That's adding miles to your coronary lifespan]
                                                                                                       

   THE BEST REST: Right after lunch is the perfect time to
cool down. But again, you don't have to waste this time.
Classic aerobic theory tells us that it is desirable to keep
your hands above the level of your heart, which explains why
one may see gymnasiums full of exercising people waving their
arms above their heads like crazed sun worshippers. If this
is so, does not the same principle apply to the feet? Of
course it does. A satisfactory position of pedal elevation
may be achieved by keeping your feet firmly planted on your
desk as often as possible. Doesn't that feel good? Your heart
thanks you.
                                                                                                       

   STIMULATE THAT ENGINE: In general, throughout the day,
business life offers many occasions to jump-start the heart
without coffee. Who's that on the phone? The senior vice
president of finance? Your third stab at the fourth-quarter
numbers were off by how much? Here comes the interoffice mail
telling you that merit increases in 1990 will be limited to
how little? Good God] Now take your heart rate. It's up
there, right? And how] A morning in the trenches is as
aerobically valuable as two hours of killer squash]
                                                                                                       

   KEEP LUBRICATED: As everybody knows, the hale and hearty
like to follow workouts by drinking clear beverages that
replenish their amino acids, salts and other nutrients.
Sometimes these people even place the sweating, cold
container against their fevered muscles for instant, topical
relief. After work, I find a full six ounces of clear
beverage is most salubrious not only for my heart but for
just about every other working part of my anatomy as well.
   The olive is optional. But highly recommended.

   WASHINGTON -- White House double talk on taxes is creating
disarray among Republicans and undercutting the
administration's strategy for winning a deficit-reduction
pact.
   Over the past two days, White House officials have sent
out a barrage of contradictory signals on the
administration's position. At a meeting with congressional
leaders on Sunday, President Bush signaled that he was ready
to consider a budget package that would include tax
increases. Then yesterday, a senior White House official,
later identified as Chief of Staff John Sununu, was quoted in
several newspapers suggesting the White House might veto any
tax increases proposed by the Democrats. Later, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater countered Mr. Sununu's comments,
calling any veto threat "crazy." He said President Bush had
specifically directed him to emphasize again there are "no
preconditions" for the budget talks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Adding further to the confusion, Vice President Dan Quayle
told CNN yesterday evening: "The American people know this
president doesn't want to raise taxes, period."
   Democratic leaders were angered by Mr. Sununu's comments,
but said they had received reassurances from the White House
and would proceed with the budget talks as planned. "We view
this incident as an extremely serious one because it could,
if repeated, threaten the success of the talks and we want
them to succeed," Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington said.
   For their part, White House officials are privately
blaming loose-lipped Republican congressional leaders for
spoiling their deficit-cutting strategy. Senate GOP Leader
Robert Dole of Kansas and House Republican Leader Robert
Michel of Illinois emerged from a meeting with Mr. Bush on
Sunday and said the president was ready to talk taxes. Two
days later, Senate Republican Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming
suggested the president was considering raising alcohol and
tobacco taxes or even instituting a national sales tax.
   The comments irritated the White House. President Bush's
advisers are well aware that their plans to cut $50 billion
or more from next year's deficit will likely involve a tax
increase of as much as $25 billion. But they had hoped to let
Democrats and the media take the lead in discussing taxes,
while the White House and Republicans hid behind the vague
phrase: "no preconditions." The comments by Republican
leaders left that strategy in ruins.
   The result of all the GOP tax talk has been an outraged
reaction from the conservative wing of the party. Nineteen
Republican senators wrote Mr. Bush declaring they
"unequivocally oppose new taxes." And at a jammed news
conference yesterday, such tax foes as former White House
Budget Director James Miller and supply-side economist
Richard Rahn of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined a slew of
Republican lawmakers calling on Mr. Bush to resist taxes. "I
have a message for the president," said Sen. William Roth
(R., Del.). "`Read my lips. Keep the campaign pledge.'"
   The latest equivocations by the White House have made wary
Democrats even more skeptical about the president's
intentions. "This is not a good-faith effort," said House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.). "You've
got a tough enough problem . . . without all of this
political guerrilla warfare.
   In short, the budget talks are off to a very bumpy start.
   The talks could still lead to a major deficit-reduction
agreement this year. But the White House faces the extremely
difficult balancing act of keeping the conservative rank and
file of the GOP under control and at the same time convincing
Democrats that it is seriously interested in negotiating a
deal. The task seems to be creating some tension between
Chief of Staff Sununu, who is ministering to the Republican
right, and Budget Director Richard Darman, who must convince
Democrats that the White House is negotiating in good faith.
   Even before the latest problems, the budget discussions
were fraught with ill will left over from last year's budget
talks. Democrats feel the White House engaged them in
deficit-cutting negotiations but then turned around and
pushed a cut in the capital-gains tax instead. Administration
officials recognized the leftover animosity, and had hoped to
establish an atmosphere of trust and cooperation by holding
last Sunday's talks in the privacy of the White House family
quarters. But word of the meeting got out, prompting media
scrutiny.
   President Bush called Speaker Foley yesterday morning on
another matter, and the speaker raised his concerns about Mr.
Sununu's comments, aides said. Mr. Foley wouldn't discuss the
conversation in detail, but said he came away reassured. "As
far as I understand," he said, "the president is reiterating
the previous statements that there are no preconditions."
Sen. Mitchell had an aide call White House lobbyist Fred
McClure to complain. In a joint statement read by Sen.
Mitchell, Democratic negotiators called Mr. Sununu's comments
"untrue, unfair and ill-timed."
   Other Democrats weren't so easily placated. Rep. Marty
Russo (D., Ill.) said he had been resigned to a bipartisan
budget summit, but now is having second thoughts. "The
comments in the press have changed the ground rules," he
said. "They give you reason to pause. Who speaks for the
president of the United States?" Mr. Russo says congressional
leaders shouldn't begin bargaining unless Mr. Bush goes on
television or Budget Director Darman testifies before
Congress on why the deficit is now so much more of a crisis
and what the administration proposes to do about it.
   Added Rep. Samuel Gejdensen (D., Conn.): "We hear whispers
from Darman. We hear whispers from Sununu. This guy {Mr.
Bush} wants to be president except when it comes to making a
decision."
   Some Republicans in Congress were obviously embarrassed by
the disarray at the White House. Minority Leader Michel said,
"The decision has got to be made whether you go into one of
these things in good faith, and being candid and open and
honest with one another or I don't know that you have any
prospects for success."
   And even House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
an arch-foe of tax increase, toned down his criticism of
Democrats for trying to push the president toward tax
increases. "We are a long way from getting an agreement we
have to worry about," he said.
   Meanwhile, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the
House Ways and Means Committee disparaged lawmakers who say
that a tax increase isn't needed. And he found it
"encouraging" that the president had invited congressional
leaders to the White House, regardless of what senior aides
say.

   Congress on the Line

   The Jim Wright and Keating Five scandals have revealed how
some Members of Congress deepened the Savings and Loan crisis
by intervening with federal regulators on behalf of suspect
thrifts. Federal agencies keep thorough records of their
contacts with private lobbyists and officials from the
executive branch, but Congress has long resisted any such
records of calls that they or their staff make on behalf of
constituents.
   However, Congress's role in the S&amp;L disaster made it
impossible for Members to block plans by the three federal
agencies charged with regulating the thrift bailout to begin
logging contacts with Congress. Last month, the St.
Petersburg Times of Florida reported that at least 25 members
or aides had contacted thrift regulators by phone or mail
since last August.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many of the contacts were routine inquiries, but other
interventions were attempts to obtain a desired result from
officials.
   Senator J. Bennett Johnston personally called the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency last year to ask that it
delay plans to shut down the Security National Bank of
Shreveport, Louisiana. A week later regulators closed the
bank citing its unsafe lending practices and poor management.
Deputy Comptroller Frank Maguire said he viewed Senator
Johnston's request as "improper."
   Last December, an aide to Senator Tom Harkin "repeatedly
suggested" a legal precedent by which regulators could drop a
lawsuit against an Iowa bank. After he was told the precedent
was not relevant, the aide "persisted" in pressing for the
lawsuit to be dropped.
   Senator Orrin Hatch twice asked Bill Seidman, head of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to drop plans for a lawsuit
against directors of a Utah bank. "It would mean a lot to
me," Senator Hatch wrote. "I know you will do what is right."
The interesting thing about this case is that aides to Mr.
Hatch told the Times he sent the letters, "knowing full well
they would be made public." Public disclosure doesn't
automatically put such interventions beyond question, but it
at least gets these activities out in the open where it's
possible to make distinctions.
   Under the current, non-public system, even Members charged
with seeing that regulators perform properly have no qualms
about intervening in cases when they have a direct interest.
The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call reported last month that
in 1986, Kentucky Rep. Carroll Hubbard, chairman of the
banking subcommittee on oversight and investigations, asked
thrift regulator Ed Gray to provide financial assistance for
First Federal, a Kentucky S&amp;L for which Rep. Hubbard admitted
he had done "substantial legal work."
   "This institution is special to me for many reasons," he
wrote in a letter to Mr. Gray. "Some of my closest friends in
my hometown are on the board of directors or are employed at
First Federal."
   Federal regulators need to be watched. They make mistakes
and they have the power to wreak havoc on the lives of
private citizens. It is no answer, however, to say that the
proper balance against this potential danger is an
intervening Congress that is itself immune from some system
of checks on its power. After all, it was Congress's actions
in the first place that led to the clumsy S&amp;L bailout that
many of them are so worried about. At the least, all federal
agencies should be allowed to keep public logs of their
contacts with Members or their staffs. Voters then could
judge when their elected representatives are performing
legitimate oversight and when they're simply twisting arms
for special interests.

   Toronto Dominion Bank said it received approval from the
Federal Reserve to underwrite corporate debt in the U.S.
   The permission given Toronto Dominion to expand its
securities-related activities in the U.S. is similar to
measures approved last January for two other big Canadian
banks, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, and London-based Barclays Bank PLC.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In January 1989, the Fed permitted several U.S. banks to
underwrite corporate debt. As with the U.S. concerns, the
foreign banks' securities subsidiaries can generate only 10%
of their revenues from the underwriting of corporate debt,
commercial paper, securities backed by mortgages, consumer
debt and certain municipal bonds.
   L. Arthur English, senior vice president for Toronto
Dominion's U.S. division, said the bank's securities unit,
Toronto Dominion Securities (USA) Inc., will be ready to use
its new powers by Monday.

   Marketing:
   IBM Presses Toward Goal of Supplanting
   Apple as Teacher's Pet in U.S. Classrooms

   International Business Machines Corp. is stepping up its
campaign to unseat Apple Computer Inc. in the classroom as
the leading supplier of personal computers to primary and
secondary schools.
   IBM fired the latest salvo in the struggle by unveiling a
new PC, the Model 25 286, aimed at teachers and
administrators. But industry executives said Apple, which has
seen its share of the education market tumble sharply in the
past four years, will strike back as early as next week by
slashing prices that schools pay for several models of its
Macintosh computer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, in a videocassette mailed this week to thousands
of educators across the country, Apple Chairman John Sculley
promised that an inexpensive, color Macintosh will debut
during the 1990-1991 school year, and that the long-rumored
computer will be able to run programs written for the
fast-fading Apple II machine.
   Education and computer experts said Apple's moves were
largely defensive, however, and credited IBM with seizing the
initiative in a market that has long been owned by Apple.
   The education market over which the two computer makers
are scrapping is estimated at about $750 million a year in
the U.S. Industry marketers said its importance far outstrips
its dollar value, because it imprints brand and
operating-system loyalties on the young that translate into
billions of dollars of future sales.
   Hence the intensity with which this marketing battle is
being fought. "Apple has fallen behind in some areas, and
people have become a little panicked," said Charlotte Arnold,
director of marketing and product dissemination for
Humanities Software Inc., a Hood River, Ore., publisher of
education software. "IBM has taken that ball and run with
it."
   Specifically, educators faulted Apple for failing to
provide an easy evolutionary path from the aging Apple II,
which is still the dominant computer in education, to the
Macintosh, which Apple has touted as its natural successor.
At present, the machines can't run each others' software. In
addition, educators said, even low-end Macintoshes remain too
expensive for many schools.
   "It was clear to everybody that they needed to get out of
the (Apple II) as soon as the (Macintosh) came along," said
Kerry Johnson, director of information services and
educational technology for the Sacramento City Unified School
District. "They should have graduated and moved on; instead,
they kept us in the old technology and marketed the hell out
of it," he added.
   IBM has stepped into this breach over the past two years,
educators said, releasing a slew of inexpensive products and
programs aimed at tempting Apple users to convert to IBM
Personal System/2 PCs.
   Besides earmarking a specific model, the Model 25, for the
education market, IBM has courted administrators and teachers
by offering discounts, seminars and software designed in
consultation with education experts. In addition, IBM has
played up its strong image in the corporate world, and made
use of its far-flung marketing and service abilities.
   "I am persuaded that, more than at any time in the past
several years, they are making a tremendous commitment in
this marketplace," said Robert Pearlman, national consultant
on educational technology for the American Federation of
Teachers. "They are taking it very, very seriously," he said.
   Indeed, IBM Chairman John Akers emphasized the company's
huge gains in education at the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant's
recent annual meeting in Phoenix. For the latest complete
academic year, 1988-1989, IBM's share of the primary and
secondary school market had risen to 30% from 5% in
1985-1986. In the same period, Apple's share fell from 70% to
54%.
   Then Mr. Akers made an audacious prediction. "When we
count it up at the end of this year," he said, "there's a
good chance that IBM will be the market-share leader for the
year in kindergarten through 12th grade. . . . We'd like to
have young people who have their first experience with a
computer, either at home or in school, to have it with an IBM
computer."
   Most market watchers said this scenario may be a little
too optimistic. Some said IBM's gains, while sharp, may prove
to be temporary, and that Mr. Akers will end up with egg on
his face.
   "The story for 1990-1991 is going to be a very strong
comeback for Apple," said Peter Kelman, publisher of
Scholastic Software, an educational software concern that is
a division of Scholastic Inc. "With the cheap color
(Macintosh), they are definitely going to regain leadership.
They've never lost the hearts and minds of the teachers."
   Mr. Kelman also said many publishers of educational
software have become disillusioned with IBM computers, even
as those computers gain ground in the schools. IBM machines
are perceived to be harder to use than Apple computers, and
schools tend to buy them as part of "Integrated Learning
Systems" -- highly structured packages of hardware and
software that guide students through a predetermined
curriculum.
   That doesn't leave much room for software developers to
come up with the same kind of innovative, easy-to-use
programs that are possible with the Macintosh, Mr. Kelman
said. And such programs have proved in the past to be a
crucial ingredient for success in the education market.
   In addition, Apple has cultivated an image as an
education-oriented company for years, and it has made a big
show of donating PCs to schools. Although IBM's efforts are
gaining it many converts in the schools, it has a lot of
catching up to do.
   The 1990-1991 school year may prove to be crucial in this
regard. While Apple's engineers struggle to come up with a
machine that can turn back IBM's gains, Mr. Sculley and other
executives must convince educators that they haven't been
forgotten, countering accusations that Apple is running after
big corporate clients by concentrating on high-priced
machines -- a move that Apple defends as necessary to fill
out its product line. IBM, meanwhile, has been focusing much
of its PC efforts on the low end, giving the impression it
cares about a market Apple is neglecting.
   In essence, Apple's message is: Trust us, and give us
another year. "Our product development efforts have shifted
toward the lower end of the Macintosh product line," Mr.
Sculley said on the videocassette sent to educators.
"Education is deep in the roots of Apple. It's where we
began; it's the most important long-term strategic objective
that we have for our company," he said.
   Bernard Gifford, Apple's vice president for education, is
blunter. Admitting that the company has been bleeding market
share for the past two years, he says it's because Apple has
failed to provide enough inexpensive Macintosh products. He
especially rues the lack of a low-end Mac with a color
screen, because color bolsters children's interest in
learning. Although the Apple IIgs has a color screen, it's
seen as yesterday's technology; IBM has provided low-end
color computers for years.
   "I'm truly sorry that we can't provide that product
today," Mr. Gifford said. "But we will have it in the next
school year, and frankly, we think it's going to be a
barn-burner. . . . The (yet-to-be-announced) pricing action
on the compact Macintosh, and the introduction of an
entry-level color Mac that will run Apple II software, will
not only arrest our decline on market share, it will also
reverse the trend," he said.
   But many education watchers think IBM has put a permanent
crimp in Apple's claims to market leadership. Some point to
the trend toward hooking computers together in schools: IBM's
computers are much easier than Apple's to connect to each
other. Others note that, having gained market share, IBM is
unlikely to relinquish it, and it may even be on enough of a
roll to fulfill Mr. Akers's expectations.
   Ann Wujcik, an analyst for Link Resources Inc., a market
researcher, thinks the decisive factor will be psychological.
"IBM has changed its image totally in the eyes of the school
community," she said. "There is now a serious belief that
they care as much or more than Apple."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
IBM rose $1.125 to close at $112.375. Apple fell 50 cents to
$41.375 in national over-the-counter trading.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Subway-Begging Ban Is Backed on Appeal

SUPREME COURT (SUP)

<LP>
   A federal appeals court ruled that begging can be banned
on New York's subway system by the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority.
   The court overturned a lower court decision that
prohibited the subway system from enforcing rules against
begging. The appeals-court panel rejected Judge Leonard
Sand's ruling earlier this year that begging and panhandling
are forms of speech protected under the First Amendment of
the U.S. Constitution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A majority of the subway's over three million daily
passengers perceive begging and panhandling to be
`intimidating,' `threatening,' and `harassing,'" the appeals
court said. "We think that the district court's analysis
reflects an exacerbated deference to the alleged individual
rights of beggars and panhandlers to the great detriment of
the common good."
   The appeals court said the government's interest in
keeping the subway system safe and orderly outweighed any
concerns about restrictions on free speech. The court said
beggars' rights to free speech weren't violated because the
rules aren't meant to suppress any particular message.
   "The only message that we are able to espy as common to
all acts of begging is that beggars want to exact money from
those whom they accost," the appeals panel said in its
majority opinion.
   The Legal Action Center for the Homeless, which
represented the two homeless men who brought the suit, said
it is considering an appeal. "Silencing poor people will not
solve the homeless problem, the hunger problem or the begging
problem," said Douglas Lasdon, executive director of the
center.
   Mr. Lasdon said the case has been widely misunderstood by
people who saw it as a defense of intimidating or threatening
behavior on the subway system.
   "We only sought to protect peaceful begging," he said. He
added that the center was defending the right of people to
beg only in certain parts of the transit system -- not on
subway trains or in areas where it would impede subway users.
   The appeals court said surveys indicate that two-thirds of
the subway's 3.5 million daily passengers say they have felt
intimidated into giving money to beggars. "It is fair to say
that whether intended as so, or not, begging in the subway
often amounts to nothing less than assault, creating in the
passengers the apprehension of imminent danger," the court
said.
   ---
   INSURANCE CAN'T BE USED to pay punitive damages in New
York.
   The federal appeals court decision apparently is the first
to apply a ruling by New York state's highest court in
January that punitive damages aren't covered by insurance for
companies in New York, even if the damages were awarded in
another state.
   The court said American Home Products Corp. can't make its
insurer, Home Insurance Co., pay the $13 million in punitive
damages in a product-liability case. The damages were awarded
by an Illinois jury for injuries a two-year-old boy sustained
after taking aminophylline, used to treat respiratory
ailments.
   After American Home claimed that its insurance should
cover the damages, Home Insurance sued in federal court in
New York, where the two companies are based. Applying the
state Court of Appeals decision, which was considered a major
victory for insurers, the federal appeals court reversed a
lower-court ruling that the damages were covered.
   The federal appeals court asked the state court to resolve
the issue because it was the first time the matter had come
up in New York. The state court said that making insurers pay
would circumvent the purpose of punitive damages.
Manufacturers say product-liability insurance is meant to
cover such expenses.
   Sheila Birnbaum, an attorney for Home Insurance, said her
client was satisfied with the decision. American Home lawyers
couldn't be reached for comment.

   SHOWDOWN LOOMING over authority of federal bankruptcy
judges.
   Federal appeals courts in St. Louis and New York have
split on the question of whether bankruptcy judges may hear
jury trials involving allegedly improper transfers of a
bankrupt company's assets. The conflicting rulings may
require the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the issue, legal
experts say.
   Many bankruptcy lawyers say the question is significant
because asset-transfer disputes often involve large amounts
of money and should be resolved quickly. These lawyers
contend that delays are less likely with bankruptcy judges,
because they are specialists in such matters, and because
their caseload is lighter than that of U.S. district judges.
   District judges would hear the cases if bankruptcy judges
are found not to have the authority to do so. District courts
were formed by the Constitution, but bankruptcy courts were
created by Congress. Bankruptcy law is unclear on the issue
on who should hear jury trials. Such trials often involve the
fraudulent conveyance of assets or preferential treatment of
creditors.
   "The one thing the war on drugs has done is inundate the
district courts with criminal cases, which have priority over
civil suits," says R. Pete Smith, a bankruptcy lawyer with
McDowell, Rice &amp; Smith in Kansas City, Mo. "The federal
docket is just very crowded."
   But other lawyers argue that the district judges should
hear such cases anyway, because they are more experienced at
handling jury trials.
   In the St. Louis case, Mr. Smith brought suit on behalf of
the bankruptcy trustee of Kroh Brothers Development Co.
against United Missouri Bank of Kansas City. The suit sought
recovery of about $4 million, plus interest, that it alleged
was improperly transferred to the bank. The bankruptcy judge
granted United Missouri's request for a jury trial, but
refused its motion to move the case to district court. Last
month, a three-judge appeals-court panel in St. Louis held
the bankruptcy court wasn't authorized to hear it.
   The court said it couldn't find any language in the
federal bankruptcy stautes or legislative history to support
such authority, and didn't see any reason to imply it. But it
acknowledged that its ruling conflicted with a decision in
February by the federal appeals court in New York. That court
found both statutory and constitutional grounds for
permitting bankruptcy judges to preside over jury trials.
   "It's an interesting issue," says Thomas E. Deacy Jr., a
lawyer in Kansas City with Deacy &amp; Deacy, counsel for United
Missouri Bank. "I would think it's likely to end up in the
Supreme Court."

   NEW JERSEY SETS GUIDELINES for its new family-leave law.
   The guidelines, issued by the state attorney general's
office, were more liberal to employees than many labor
lawyers had expected. The law, which went into effect Friday,
requires New Jersey companies with more than 100 employees to
provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave every two years to workers
who need to care for newborn or adopted babies or for a sick
member of their immediate family.
   But the guidelines for complying with the law have added a
new twist. They say the law covers not only companies in New
Jersey, but employees who work in the state and are employed
by companies located elsewhere.
   "Up until now, this had been considered somewhat of a
local law. Only New Jersey companies have been focusing on
it," said Paul A. Tufano, a labor lawyer at Philadelphia's
Blank, Rome, Comisky &amp; McCauley. "Who would have thought that
companies across the country will have to comply?"
   The New Jersey division of civil rights, which drafted the
guidelines, has been fielding scores of nervous phone calls
from employers. "Oh, they're horrified. They're wailing like
babies," said James J. Sincaglia, a special assistant in the
civil-rights division. "I appreciate the dilemma they're in,
their concern that the law is a little too comprehensive."
   This year, the law covers companies with 100 or more
employees, but next year, the threshold will drop to 75. The
year after, it drops to 50. It is considered to be the
nation's most generous leave law because it requires
employers to maintain benefits for employees on leave.
   The guidelines don't carry the force of law; they are only
offered for guidance.
   The state attorney general's office plans to hold public
hearings this summer before drafting permanent regulations
that will be binding.

   U.S. SUPREME COURT IS ASKED to rehear religious-freedom
case.
   A diverse coalition of religious and civil-liberties
organizations filed a petition with the high court, seeking a
rehearing of its recent decision that the state of Oregon
didn't violate American Indians' religious freedom by barring
the use of peyote in religious ceremonies.
   By a 6-3 ruling April 17, the court upheld Oregon's
refusal to pay unemployment benefits to Alfred Smith and
Galen Black, who were fired from their jobs at a private
drug-rehabilitation center for using peyote during ceremonies
of the Native American Church. Oregon classifies peyote as an
illegal drug. The church regards peyote as a sacrament.
   The petition, prepared by the American Jewish Congress and
the Native American Program of Oregon Legal Services, argues
that the ruling "took a major step away from settled law" in
the First Amendment's free-exercise-of-religion clause.
   The Supreme Court on rare occasions grants rehearing of a
case it previously refused to decide. But the court hardly
ever grants rehearing of cases, such as the peyote case, that
have been argued and decided on the merits.

   KENNETH R. FEINBERG, The Washington, D.C., arbitration and
mass tort specialist, has stepped down as a trustee for the
Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust, the $2.45 billion settlement
fund for women injured by the Dalkon Shield contraceptive.
Mr. Feinberg, who was the first trustee named to the fund,
said he quit because of other professional commitments. The
trust fund, which is paying claims for injuries caused by the
Dalkon Shield, was created as part of the bankruptcy-law
reorganization of A.H. Robins Co. of Richmond, Va., which
sold the device. The five-member trust has two vacancies.

   Stock prices followed the bond market higher despite the
unspectacular reception given the Treasury's sale of $10
billion in 30-year bonds.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 5.63 points, to
2738.51 in moderately active trading. But the dollar
continued its slump against the mark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said that although there wasn't strong demand for
the $10 billion of 30-year bonds that the Treasury auctioned,
it was sufficient to reinforce perceptions that interest
rates have peaked. The average yield on the bonds was 8.84%.
Last week, yields on the previously issued 30-year bond
reached a one-year high of 9.03%.
   Traders said that with the auction overhanging the stock
market, it has been difficult to gauge the recent strength in
stock prices. "Everyone obviously keeps saying, `How's the
auction going, how's the auction going?'" says Larry
Greenwald, a block trader at Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co.
   The risk that interest rates might move higher in coming
weeks has kept many stock-market investors on the sidelines
recently. They've been afraid that a resurgence in inflation
would force the Federal Reserve to drive short-term interest
rates higher to slow the economy, and cool corporate profits
along with it.
   But recent economic statistics indicate that slower growth
may occur without any nudging from the Fed. With investors
generally eager to purchase Treasury debt, especially the
$10.5 billion of three-year notes auctioned Tuesday, much of
the anxiety about an interest-rate spurt has eased.
   But analysts caution that stock prices aren't likely to
head skyward anytime soon. For one thing, investors are still
awaiting more evidence about inflationary trends. The release
today of the April producer price index, a measure of
wholesale inflation, isn't expected to help much. Economists
predict it will be up about 0.2%. That's an annualized rate
of about 2.5%, but it compares with a 0.2% decline in March.
Consumer prices, which have been rising considerably faster
than wholesale prices, will be reported next week.
   Longer term, analysts point to poor corporate earnings as
another drag on stock prices. Although comparisons should
improve later this year with year-earlier results, few
investors are willing to bet heavily that earnings will
rebound sharply.
   In currencies, much of the attention was focused on the
dollar/Swiss-franc exchange rate, as recent demand for the
francs eased slightly. Swiss francs had become highly
desirable because of higher interest rates in Switzerland and
Japanese purchases of the currency to pay for maturing bonds
denominated in Swiss francs. In late New York trading, the
dollar was at 1.3880 Swiss francs, down from 1.4025.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in fairly active trading. Volume totaled
158.5 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where
advancers led losers 847 to 601.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading the U.S.
currency was quoted at 1.6285 marks and 156.70 yen compared
with 1.6360 marks and 156.50 yen.

coffee.
   The ad was produced by Neighbor to Neighbor, a national
organization based in San Francisco that advocates ending
U.S. investments in El Salvador. The group also is urging
consumers to boycott coffee made of beans grown in El
Salvador.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ad ends with an upturned coffee cup spilling what
appears to be blood and urges viewers to boycott Folgers. A
local branch of Neighbor to Neighbor paid Boston's WHDH-TV, a
CBS affiliate, $1,000 to run the ad, said Sy Yanoff,
president of the station.
   "We looked at the ad, and it met our standards for
commercial advertisements," Mr. Yanoff said. He added that a
P&amp;G official called the station Wednesday to discuss the
Neighbor to Neighbor ad but didn't say the company planned to
pull its ads.
   Then yesterday, "our representative in New York called and
said P&amp;G just canceled all its current ads at our station,"
Mr. Yanoff said. He added that P&amp;G spends about $1 million
annually on ads at the station.
   A spokesman for the Cincinnati-based consumer products
firm, confirming that P&amp;G had canceled its ads, said the
Neighbor to Neighbor commercial is "highly offensive." It
attacks P&amp;G and Folgers, "and that's not the type of ad
environment we want for our ads."

   Two bond-rating services downgraded Domtar Inc.'s debt,
citing weak earnings at the Montreal paper and building
products concern.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it downgraded Domtar's senior
secured debt rating to triple-B-minus from triple-B,
affecting about U.S. $250 million of debt. Standard &amp; Poor's
said the "downgrade reflects Domtar's weaker-than-expected
earnings performance in 1989, which has continued into 1990."

   Canadian Bond Rating Service said it cut its ratings on
Domtar's commercial paper to single-A-2 from single-A-1, on
Domtar's debentures to B plus plus (Low) from B plus plus,
and on Domtar's preferred shares to P-3 (Low) from P-3.
   The service said the strength of the Canadian dollar
against the U.S. dollar "exacerbated the overall financial
condition of the company" as prices for paper products
weakened. As well, the rating service said declining
construction activity in North America has hurt Domtar's
building products operations.

   Fried. Krupp G.m.b.H. says it has completed its
restructuring program and is poised to post a significant
group profit for 1990.
   "Our large structural problems have been solved," said
Gerhard Cromme, chairman of the Essen, West Germany-based
steel and engineering concern, in an interview. "We are
herewith returning to normalcy."

   Krupp posted solid operating earnings last year after a
deficit in 1988, and earnings are set to climb further this
year, Mr. Cromme said.
   "Everything is running well at the moment," and even the
slowdown in the global steel market won't create any major
problems for Krupp, the chairman said. "In the steel sector,
we are hurt just like everybody else. But one can't talk
about a significant weakening. . . . It's just a return to a
normal level."
   Despite that positive picture, the group is likely to post
only a breakeven result for 1989 because of charges related
to previous losses and measures to strengthen the balance
sheet, Mr. Cromme said.

   GENEVA -- Union Bank of Switzerland President Robert
Studer criticized the Swiss government for pursuing
conflicting economic policies, and warned that if reforms
aren't implemented to make the Swiss financial center more
competitive, the country's largest banks may be forced to
take more of their business abroad.
   "A lot will depend on the government to create the
environment for the banks to do what they have to do in order
to stay internationally competitive, Mr. Studer said, in a
speech to the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce. "If the
Swiss authorities continue to hinder Switzerland from
maintaining its present position . . ., the major Swiss banks
will certainly follow their customers."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In particular, he attacked the government's 35%
withholding tax on interest and dividend income, and the
stamp tax on securities transactions, both of which he said
make Switzerland less competitive. The stamp tax alone, he
added, "is largely responsible for the noteworthy absence of
a liquid and developed money market in Switzerland, and for
driving the Eurobond market abroad."
   Mr. Studer also said various branches of the Swiss
government appear to be pursuing conflicting policies,
further muddying the image of the country's financial center.
   "Whereas the Swiss National Bank is following a tight
monetary policy to fight inflation, the government tells the
banks to restrict themselves in increasing lending rates," he
said.

   Lawyers Castigate
   Undercover Agent
   In Futures Inquiry

   CHICAGO -- The undercover federal agent who posed as a
Swiss franc futures trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
was a rank amateur who once dropped his deck of trading cards
and temporarily "lost" orders in his own pocket, said an
attorney for Robert Mosky, one of three futures traders on
trial here for allegedly defrauding customers.
   Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent Randall Jannett was
depicted by attorneys for all three accused traders in their
opening agruments as being insufficiently trained to
understand the complex and chaotic activity in a futures
trading pit. As a result, the evidence gathered by the
neophyte trader, including secret tape-recordings, doesn't
support the government's allegations that Mr. Mosky and
co-defendants Danny Scheck and David Zatz stole trading
profits from customers, the attorneys said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Agent Jannett was "confused, incompetent, or something in
the middle," maintained Elliot Samuels, Mr. Mosky's attorney.
   The trial of the Swiss franc traders is expected to last
about six weeks, and will be followed in September by trials
of Japanese yen futures and soybean futures traders from the
Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, respectively. These
traders are among the 48 individuals indicted last year on
the two exchanges and charged with stealing from customers.
   The FBI agent posed as a Swiss franc futures trader from
February through December of 1988 in order to gather evidence
of alleged wrongdoing. On April 14 of that year, the day he
dropped his order deck and lost orders in his pocket, his
hidden tape recorder gathered incriminating evidence against
him, not other traders, the attorneys said.
   Swiss franc futures prices were fluctuating wildly that
day, and the tape of the agent "captured the voice of a man
out of control, totally lost in the midst of a commodity
pit," said Harvey Silets, Mr. Scheck's attorney.
   Mr. Silets pointed out that four of the five disputed
trades that form the basis for the felony counts against his
client occurred during Agent Jannett's first two and a half
months in the pit. Mr. Silets asserted that the agent wasn't
adequately schooled in commodity trading by that point to be
a reliable witness to trades.
   The U.S. attorney's office, and not just the FBI, has a
shaky understanding of futures trading, asserted Alan
Blumenthal, Mr. Zatz's attorney. He pointed out that when
assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Pollack made his opening remarks
to the jury Wednesday, he incorrectly described Chicago Merc
trading rules governing the circumstances under which traders
can make bids and offers in the trading pit.
   Mr. Blumenthal emphasized the small amount of money
involved in the disputed trades that form the basis of the
felony counts against his client. Four of the six disputed
trades resulted in profits to Mr. Zatz of $50 or less for
each trade, Mr. Blumenthal said.
   He also attempted to disparage the evidence against the
traders that will be presented by two other Swiss franc
traders, Mark Fuhrman and William Walsh. They were caught
stealing from customers by the agent, pleaded guilty and
agreed to testify against the traders on trial in expectation
of relatively light sentences.
   "That was the best futures trade those guys ever made,"
Mr. Blumenthal quipped.

   TORONTO -- Conwest Exploration Co., Mineral Resources
International Ltd. and Barons Oil Ltd. said their
shareholders approved the merger of the three companies.
   Under terms of the merger, Conwest, a Toronto-based oil,
gas and mining concern, will issue new Class B subordinate
voting shares to minority holders of both subsidiaries.
Conwest owns 51% of Mineral Resources, a mining concern.
Toronto-based Mineral Resources owns 85% of Barons, an oil
and gas production company based in Calgary, Alberta.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new company will retain the name Conwest Exploration
Co. The merger is expected to take effect June 1.
   Separately, John Lamacraft, Conwest's president and chief
executive officer, said he expects operating income this year
of 65.5 million Canadian dollars ($56.2 million) on revenue
of C$122.1 million, up from last year's operating income of
C$56.6 million and revenue of C$103.2 million. Operating
income is figured before taxes, depreciation, interest costs
and minority interest payments.
   Mr. Lamacraft, speaking at the company's annual meeting,
said the gains will come largely from increased production of
oil and natural gas, following several recent acquisitions.
   In yesterday's trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange,
Conwest Class B shares closed at 12.75 Canadian dollars
($10.94), up 37.5 cents. Mineral Resources shares rose 37.5
cents, to C$5.50; and Barons shares gained 15 cents, to close
at C$2.90.

   Dealers Mysterious Death

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Alex Maslansky ambles into the
Beverly Hills Baseball Card Shop and plunks down $50 for a
1986 Jose Canseco rookie special.
   The blue-bordered card of the Oakland A's slugger is "a
great investment," bound to be worth $80 before long, he
says. Alex is 11 years old.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I like the tension," he adds, particularly when he runs
to get the latest Beckett Baseball Monthly, the bible of
price guides, "to see if what I have went up or down." Gary
Moody, an adult friend of Alex, likens baseball cards to
penny stocks. He adds approvingly: "It teaches him about
business."
   And about life. Alex has followed with interest the plight
of Bob Engel, a veteran National League umpire, who was
arrested last month and charged with pulling a brown paper
bag out of his pants and stuffing it with seven boxes of
baseball cards at a discount store in Bakersfield, Calif.
   Mr. Engel, who himself has appeared on umpire cards,
produced by T&amp;M Sports Inc., pleaded innocent last week to
three counts of petty theft and burglary. He has been
suspended from working any games until the situation is
cleared up.
   Ever since some people began viewing these cardboard
portraits of sports stars as offering a better return on
investment than equities or precious metals, baseball cards
have boomed into a $1 billion-plus industry. And like most,
this one has its share of greed, bamboozlement, out-and-out
thievery -- and, apparently, one brutal murder.
   Television's "L.A. Law," as good a barometer of the modern
American scene as any, aired an episode earlier this year in
which Benny, the retarded office clerk, nearly lost his shirt
in a squabble over his card collection. ("Look, what are
these things worth, a few hundred dollars?" asked Stuart
Markowitz, Benny's friend and counsel. "Try $13,000 -- and
it's an appreciating asset," responded a ruthless Jerry, the
man in pursuit of Benny's near-mint 1962 Warren Spahn.)
   The preoccupation with investment isn't limited to
high-rent districts like Beverly Hills. "You see plenty of
parents pressuring their kids to pick the right cards and,
consequently, I get a lot of grim-faced 12-year-olds in my
store," says Fred Harris, who runs the Great American
Baseball Card Co. in Concord, Mass. "It really bothers me
that they're not flipping them and trading them and putting
them on their bicycle wheels like I used to do."
   Mr. Harris, author of "The Great American Baseball Card
Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book," published in 1973,
says he has started to measure the width of cards that people
try to sell him because some have taken to razoring off a
ragged corner or a rough edge to make their merchandise seem
more pristine.
   "Money breeds scum," says Matt Federgreen, the owner of
the Beverly Hills shop. He rues the passing of a more artless
era, when children bought packs of cards (once a penny, now
at least 50 cents) simply hoping to stumble upon their
favorite players. He fondly recalls the days when he didn't
have to add a second alarm system and a video camera to his
store.
   But card-shop owners can't be too careful these days. A
four-hour drive north of here, in the peaceful Mission town
of San Luis Obispo, police are hunting for Frank Gove's
murderer.
   Two months ago, Mr. Gove, the proprietor of Central Coast
Baseball Cards, was found slumped behind one of his display
cases, bludgeoned to death with a blunt object. Baseball and
football cards valued at $10,000 were missing. "We're
perplexed at the level of violence," says Mike Brennler, the
detective working the case. "I mean, baseball is supposed to
be the all-American game. This is really the dark side."
   Many collectors, speculators and hucksters think too much
is being made of such bad news. Most dealers are reputable,
insists Kit Young, a prominent card salesman in Vancouver,
Wash. "For kids, this remains a lot better than squandering
their money on drugs or pinball or something." Nevertheless,
Mr. Young will be meeting with scores of his peers in St.
Louis later this month to consider forming a national dealers
association governed by a code of ethics.
   There is no denying that some dealers today aren't content
just counting cards; some are counterfeiting them as well.
Upper Deck Co., one of the "Big Five" card manufacturers,
includes a "counterfeit-proof" hologram on the back of each
card. "When we started in 1988, lots of collectors termed it
a gimmick," says Don Bodow, a vice president at the Yorba
Linda, Calif., company. "They don't do that anymore."
   For some, the biggest worry isn't blatant criminal
activity, but more subtle forms of subterfuge. For example,
The Big Five -- Topps Co., Fleer Corp. the Donruss brand
(made by Leaf Inc., a unit of Huhtamaki of Finland), Score
Inc. and Upper Deck-are routinely accused of purposely
putting out cards with errors, and then recalling them in an
attempt to generate interest in their products. They all
vehemently deny the accusation.
   However, the companies make no bones about trying to take
back rare gems that are distributed by accident. Lee Hull, a
dealer in Champaign, Ill., caused a fuss when he said he
discovered in a regular 1990 Topps wax-paper-wrapped pack a
baseball card showing President Bush during his playing days
at Yale.
   Brooklyn-based Topps says it meant to send all 100 Bush
cards it printed as a gift to the commander-in-chief, and it
considers the item "stolen property." Now, things have gotten
complicated. Mr. Hull has been sued by one of his customers,
who claims that he agreed to buy the card for 15 cents. Mr.
Hull maintains that there was never such a deal. Meanwhile,
the card sits in limbo in a Champaign courthouse.
   To many, the skyrocketing price of cards is itself a
travesty. According to the latest Beckett monthly, an
unblemished copy of Mickey Mantle's 1952 Topps card goes for
$7,000. Even a 1984 Fleer card of New York Mets ace Dwight
Gooden is listed at $80, and a 1984 Donruss version of Yankee
Don Mattingly fetches $70. "I feel a little remorse, because
the average individual gets priced out of the market,"
concedes Tom Mortenson, the editor of Sports Collectors
Digest, the leading promotional vehicle for card peddlers.
   But some tycoons who regularly pitch their wares in his
weekly journal summarily dismiss the gripers. "It sounds to
me like they're jealous" of those who've hit it big, says
Alan "Mr. Mint" Rosen, who not long ago began asking $2
million for a creased but uncut 1910 strip of five cards
printed for distribution in cigarette packs but never
marketed. Among them is what is known as the rarest and most
famous card of all, a T-206 Honus Wagner. (One story goes
that Mr. Wagner was a nonsmoker who demanded the card be
withdrawn and destroyed; another is that the cigarette
company wouldn't pay him enough to use his photo.)
   "Sure, we've ruined their hobby," Mr. Rosen says. "But
isn't this what America is all about?"
   "The prices are going crazy because the stuff is great,"
adds Joshua Evans, another shameless high-roller when it
comes to sports collectibles. "Look, I'm not a rocket
scientist. I won't win the Nobel Prize. I just make people
feel good" by selling cards and other memorabilia.
   Some others don't make people feel very good, however.
Sports Collectors Digest has had to ban a number of dealers
from advertising because they sold bogus cards or sent out
nothing at all. A few have been prosecuted for mail fraud and
thrown in jail.
   Perhaps no single incident, however, has captivated the
card-collecting community more than the arrest of umpire
Engel, 56 years old. Bakersfield police say he tried to make
off with 4,180 Score cards, worth $143.98, from a store last
month.
   Shortly before last week's arraignment, the district
attorney's office in Bakersfield also charged Mr. Engel in
connection with a January episode in which he allegedly
snatched about 50 packs of cards from another store. Neither
he nor his lawyer will comment on the case.
   Whatever the outcome of the Engel affair, many see it as
yet another signal that the age of innocence in card
collecting is gone forever.
   "We're fixated on money and sports, and cards are just
another chance to put them together," says Lew Lipset, viewed
by some as the curmudgeon of card collecting, and by others
as its conscience. Writing in a recent edition of his monthly
newsletter, The Old Judge, he concluded: "Try to make a
living in this hobby and you'll learn about . . . deceit,
unfair business practices, the lack of truth in advertising,
price manipulation, collusion, restraint of trade, insider
trading, patronage, extortion, payoffs and bribes, graft,
plagiarism and, last but not least, hype."

   Bond Media's Deal
   For U.S. Cash Boost

   NEW YORK -- Reports that Bond Media Ltd., the owner of an
Australian television network, is about to receive a large
cash infusion from three U.S. companies may be greatly
exaggerated.
   Dispatches out of Sydney, Australia, quoted Bond Media
officials as saying they were close to completing a deal to
receive $125 million from an unusual trio of U.S. companies:
Paramount Communications Inc., CBS Inc. and General Electric
Co.'s NBC unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But a Paramount spokesman would say only that the
entertainment company is considering making an investment and
wouldn't comment on the involvement of other parties. An NBC
spokesman said that company isn't involved at all: "We were
approached by Bond. We told them what it would take to do a
deal from our point of view. It is our understanding they are
pursuing other options."
   And a CBS spokeswoman said CBS is in only "preliminary"
discussions regarding such an investment. CBS President
Laurence A. Tisch has been reluctant in the past to expand
CBS's scope of operations beyond getting the third-place
network back on track.
   Bond has been under pressure to refinance a large amount
of debt taken on several years ago to buy the Channel Nine
network.

   Commodities:
   World Oil Prices Hold Up, Bucking Expectations
   Of Technical Slide After Wednesday's Big Rally

   World oil prices held firm despite widespread expectation
that a technical correction would follow Wednesday's sizzling
rally.
   In European spot markets, North Sea crudes generally were
up five cents to 10 cents a barrel. In the U.S. futures
market, active trading pushed West Texas Intermediate crude
for June delivery up more than 30 cents a barrel, suggesting
at one point a possible repeat of Wednesday's gain of 71
cents a barrel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the June crude contract failed to go higher than
$19.31 a barrel, and profit-taking in late trading brought it
back from there. Still, it settled at $19.02, up three cents,
while July delivery West Texas was up four cents to $19.48 a
barrel.
   Traders generally cited three factors for the gains: the
impact of labor troubles in North Sea oil fields, the
emerging demand for "sweet" low-sulfur crudes with the big
gasoline season near, and a growing belief among oil-market
participants that members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will honor last week's agreement to cut
output by nearly 1.5 million barrels a day.
   "There is a definite change in sentiment on that
agreement," said William Hinton, a Stotler &amp; Co. energy
futures broker.
   The OPEC agreement was initially greeted skeptically in
world oil markets. But several leading OPEC members have
since given strong signals of plans to do their part to
implement the agreement.
   Among the more vocal in making such pledges have been
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Nigeria and Indonesia. In
Iraq, an oil ministry official said yesterday that Issam
Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, the Iraqi minister, will go to
Riyadh tomorrow to meet with Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil
minister, on the OPEC efforts.
   Mr. Nazer has been in the U.S. since last weekend for a
meeting in New York of the board of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and
to visit facilities of Star Enterprise, the Saudi venture
with Texaco Inc. He was to return to Saudi Arabia after a
trip to New Orleans yesterday. But before leaving Geneva,
where OPEC held its meeting, Mr. Nazer told reporters he
already had informed Saudi customers to expect cuts.
   Saudi Arabia and two other major Persian Gulf producers,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have been in the
limelight since oil prices began falling sharply some weeks
ago because each has been producing well beyond its OPEC
quota. Indeed, the three should account for the bulk of the
reductions called for in the OPEC pact.
   According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, Abu
Dhabi, the chief member of the United Arab Emirates, has
asked several of its contract buyers to reduce the amount of
crude oil they plan to take this month. It wasn't immediately
clear, however, whether the reductions would total as much as
the 200,000 barrels a day that Mana Said Otaiba, the
emirates' oil minister, pledged to cut.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices edged higher. The May contract,
which will cease trading on May 29, rose 1.30 cents a pound
to $1.2570. July advanced 0.90 cent a pound to $1.1840.
During trading, both contracts established fresh
life-of-contract highs, May at $1.2710 and July at $1.1925.
The premiums of nearer positions over more deferred ones
continued to widen in New York and London. New York tended to
reflect the strength in London, where there was active demand
for copper from merchants, an analyst said. In Peru, there
was still concern that workers at Centromin, which is a major
Peruvian mining firm but a relatively minor copper producer,
may walk out. Also in Peru, labor negotiations are continuing
between Southern Peru Copper Corp. and unions, even though
employees have returned to work after an eight-week strike.
Both developments created uncertainty that was reflected in
firmer prices, an analyst said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures rose while gold and
platinum eased. July delivery silver finished 5.7 cents an
ounce higher at $5.15. June gold retreated $1.80 an ounce to
$371.90. July platinum declined $1.90 an ounce to $484.60.
There has been sporadic demand from the Far East for silver
over the past month, an analyst said. As a result, demand for
futures contracts pushed prices higher, he said. The July
silver contract thrust above the key resistance level of
$5.11 and, when resting buying orders were touched off, the
rally ran up to $5.18 before receding, the analyst said.
Platinum at first was firm on some demand for the metal in
Japan, but later slipped in sympathy with gold, the analyst
said. Separately, the Silver Institute, a Washington,
D.C.-based industry group, announced that it had retained CPM
Group, a New York precious metals research company, to
produce the World Silver Survey, an annual review of the
international silver market, to be published later this year.
John Lutley, executive director of the institute, noted that
the gold and platinum industries have authoritative sources
of figures, but that similar sources of silver information
had disappeared as a result of a decline in trading of the
metal in recent years. "The gold industry has Consolidated
Gold Fields, which spends a half-million {pounds sterling}
annually and sends an army of people around the world to
gather information on gold, and platinum has Johnson Matthey,
another major international firm, which collects facts and
figures and analyzes the platinum market in depth," he said.
CPM Group, whose managing director is Jeffrey M. Christian,
is expected to fill that gap in silver, Mr. Lutley said.

   U S West Inc., Denver, said its Cable London joint venture
with Comcast Corp. was awarded a franchise to provide
cable-television and telephone services to two boroughs of
London.
   Construction of the $75 million system, to serve Islington
and Hackney boroughs, is expected to begin in the fall.
Service is supposed to be available by the end of this year.
The franchise will serve about 152,000 homes and 12,000
businesses, U S West said.

   Industry officials predicted that the move will expand
business opportunities in the North London market, helping to
justify the expense of developing locally generated
television programming.
   U S West, a diversified telecommunications concern, has
won eight other cable franchises in the U.K. And the company
is developing a cable venture in Hong Kong.
Philadelphia-based Comcast, one of the largest cable
operators in the U.S., also has interests in cellular
communications.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Industrial Stocks Close 5.63 Higher
   Despite Late Pullback; Volume Up

   NEW YORK -- Despite a late pullback, the stock market
built on its recent advance amid the busiest trading in
nearly three weeks.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up 5.63 to 2738.51
as solid gains among several blue-chip issues more than
offset a second day of selling in Westinghouse Electric,
which fell in the wake of negative comments from analysts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
gained 0.96 to 343.82, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index rose 0.65 to 188.14 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index rose 1.28 to 319.96. Advancing issues outpaced
decliners by 847 to 601 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Big Board activity has been on the upswing all week, and
the latest session continued that trend. About 158,460,000
shares were traded, the highest total since April 20; on
Wednesday, volume totaled 152.2 million shares.
   Traders said the amount of business from institutional
investors picked up from recent levels, with the technology
and drug sectors drawing considerable buying interest.
   Since April 27, when the industrial average retreated to
its recent low of 2645.05, the average has climbed a total of
93.46 points, or 3.5%. Aside from Wednesday's decline of 0.68
points, the 30-stock index hasn't shown a loss over that
period.
   "As we move up, people want to jump on the bandwagon
before the bandwagon moves out of the station," said Edward
J. Shopkorn, director of institutional equities at Mabon,
Nugent. "There appears to be some genuine interest on the buy
side."
   But prices slipped from session highs along with bonds in
late trading after the release of results from the Treasury's
sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds, which concluded the
quarterly refunding. The average yield of 8.84% on the long
bond was in line with expectations.
   Nervousness about the April producer price report, to be
issued before today's opening, also was cited as a factor in
the market's late retreat. The data are expected to show that
the index went up 0.2%, according to a consensus of
economists surveyed by Dow Jones; the "core" inflation rate,
or prices excluding food and energy, is expected to be up
0.3%.
   Market players will be looking to the April figures for
evidence that inflationary pressures aren't accelerating, as
several pieces of data issued during the first quarter had
suggested otherwise.
   Among technology issues, International Business Machines
advanced 1 1/8 to 112 3/8, Hewlett-Packard rose 1 3/8 to 46
1/4, Compaq Computer added 7/8 to 107 and Texas Instruments
went up 1 1/4 to 36 7/8. Motorola added 2 to 74 5/8; Merrill
Lynch raised its short-term investment rating on the stock
and boosted its estimates of 1990 and 1991 earnings, citing
continued strength in the company's cellular telephone
business.
   SmithKline Beecham jumped 2 to 39 3/4 on Big Board
composite volume of 1.8 million shares and Bristol-Myers
Squibb gained 7/8 to 59 3/8 on 1.7 million shares. Smith
Barney, Harris Upham repeated its buy recommendations on the
two drug stocks; analyst Christina Heuer said earnings at
SmithKline should be 50% to 60% higher than year-earlier
levels by the second half and both companies should have
"significant cost-saving benefits" from the mergers they
completed last year.
   Merck, another drug issue, contributed to the rise in the
Dow industrials by gaining 7/8 to 75 5/8. Other issues in the
30-stock average to attract buyers included Eastman Kodak,
which went up 1 to 39 1/8 as 2.1 million shares changed
hands; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 3/4 to 41 1/4;
Exxon, up 1/2 to 46 5/8, and Boeing, up 1 5/8 to 75 3/8.
   But Westinghouse, which dropped 1 1/2 Wednesday after the
company's appearance at an investment conference in Palm
Beach, Fla., lost another 2 to 72.
   Analysts with at least two firms, Dean Witter Reynolds and
UBS Securities, lowered investment ratings on the stock
following the presentation. UBS analyst Robert McCoy said his
decision to downgrade Westinghouse reflected his belief that
earnings growth and return on equity are likely to slow down
over the next three years.
   General Electric rose 1/2 to 67 1/4 on 2.6 million shares
after Salomon Brothers repeated its recommendation on the
stock, which carries the firm's highest investment rating.
Analyst Russell L. Leavitt said earnings at GE should show
"improvement in the double digits" this year and could
surpass his current estimate of $4.90 to $5 a share.
   Prime Motor Inns climbed 1 to 10 as 1.6 million shares
were traded. Shearson Lehman Hutton increased its short-term
and long-term investment ratings on the stock.
   Georgia Gulf rose 5/8 to 7 on two million shares. Goldman
Sachs resumed coverage of the stock with a buy
recommendation, citing its view that the shares are
undervalued; the firm hadn't carried a rating on Georgia Gulf
while it served as financial adviser for its
recapitalization.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich dropped 1/4 to 3 1/2 after
breaking off talks about possible sales of some assets and
public debt.
   Thomson of Canada was the potential buyer, according to
Eugene McCarthy, a Harcourt director; however, the company
never identified the other party.
   ITT rose 2 to 54 3/4 after indicating to analysts that it
is willing to discuss the sale of all or part of its 37%
interest in Alcatel with Compagnie Generale d'Electricite,
which owns the other 63%.
   Dividend-related trading swelled volume in two issues:
Kemper, which went up 3/8 to 35 1/2 and ranked as the most
active Big Board stock on 3.4 million shares, and
Southwestern Public Service, which rose 1/8 to 28 1/8 on 1.8
million shares.
   Shaw Industries, which plummeted 2 7/8 Wednesday, fell
another 1 1/2 to 28 3/4 on 1.4 million shares. The sell-off
came after Merrill Lynch and Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer
lowered their forecasts of the company's earnings for its
fiscal fourth quarter, ending in June.
   Columbia Gas System lost 2 to 45 5/8.
   Coastal, rumored as a potential suitor for the company,
said it doesn't own any Columbia Gas shares and isn't
interested in a takeover.
   Wal-Mart Stores, which reported that its first-quarter net
income rose about 28% from the 1989 level, added 5/8 to 52.
Its earnings per share for the latest period, 45 cents,
exceeded most analysts' forecasts.
   Other retailing stocks rallied in the wake of strong April
sales reports. Gap, whose sales jumped 31% overall and 25%
for stores open at least one year, surged 3 7/8 to 67 3/8;
meanwhile, Limited gained 1 to 42 3/8 and Jamesway rose 1/2
to 5.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.39
to 348.92. Volume totaled 13,400,000 shares.
   K-V Pharmaceutical climbed 2 1/4 to 13. The company agreed
to give Burroughs Wellcome's Canadian unit the right to
market two products using its timed-release systems; terms
weren't disclosed.
   Hershey Oil rose 1/2 to 5 3/8. American Exploration agreed
to pay $7 a share for as much as 20% of the company's common
stock and acquire the rest through an exchange of stock.
American Exploration finished unchanged at 3 5/8.
   Telesphere Communications rose 3/4 to 5 5/8, a 52-week
high. Henry S. Daniel, an analyst at Josephthal &amp; Co., said
the company stands to report better earnings if its proposed
acquisition of National Telephone Services is completed.

   There have been a rash of layoffs announced across the

revealed earlier this week that it was pulling its aircraft
operations out of Burbank, Calif., plans to let go at least
2,750 workers by June. In addition, Boeing Co., General

   British Petroleum PLC registered a 43% plunge in
first-quarter profit, with depressed chemical earnings and
inventory losses countering strong growth in exploration and

   First-quarter sales advanced 36%.

<TEXT>
   Britain's biggest oil company saw net in the quarter drop
to #344 million ($578 million) from #608 million ($1.02
billion) the year earlier. These figures are on a
historic-cost basis, which values inventories at the cost of
acquisition. They include a #19 million inventory loss,
compared with a #234 million gain a year earlier.
   Per-share earnings dropped 38% to 6.4 pence (10.7 cents)
from 10.3 pence.
   On a replacement-cost basis, which excludes the effect of
inventory gains or losses, net fell a more modest 5.2% to
#361 million from #381 million.
   Sales jumped to #8.86 billion from #6.53 billion.
   Despite the earnings slide, the company said it would
increase its first-quarter dividend to 3.95 pence from 3.65
pence.

   The automobile group Peugeot S.A. said in Paris that its
consolidated revenue rose to 44.14 billion francs ($8.02
billion) in the first quarter from 40.92 billion ($7.44
billion) in the comparable 1989 period.
   Peugeot said the 8% overall advance was led by its
Automobiles Citroen unit, which recorded a 13% sales gain to
16.84 billion francs. Sales by the group's other main car
unit, Automobiles Peugeot, climbed only 4%, to 25.42 billion
francs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The group said the slower sales growth for Automobiles
Peugeot reflected flooding problems at its plant in Sochaux
in February. It added that the floods trimmed production by
about 12,000 units and said that delay is currently being
made up.
   Peugeot didn't report comparable earnings figures for the
first quarter. For all of 1989, the group reported
consolidated net profit of 10.30 billion francs after
payments to minority interests. Revenue was 152.96 billion
francs.

   BASF AG said group pretax profit slipped 6.6% in the first
quarter, as a stronger mark and lower product prices
depressed the group's profit margins.
   Earnings at West Germany's largest chemical concern
slipped to 845 million marks ($516.8 million) from 905
million marks a year earlier. Group sales were little
changed, easing to 11.89 billion marks from 11.97 billion
marks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chairman Hans Albers said the rise of the mark against the
dollar, yen and pound depressed revenue after conversion into
marks. If currency rates had remained steady, first-quarter
profit would have been up from a year earlier, he said at a
news conference.
   Another negative factor was product prices, which fell
significantly from a year-earlier level because of a buildup
of global production capacity and stronger competition, he
said.
   Despite slower growth, "we don't see a profound period of
weakness for chemicals approaching," Mr. Albers said. He
added that he hopes BASF will be able to match its 1989
record results this year, but he declined to make a specific
forecast.

   The board didn't set a price ceiling or a time limit for

the buy-back strategy is common among companies in which
Warren E. Buffett is a major investor. Mr. Buffett, chairman

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department stunned commodity
analysts and traders by forecasting a 1990 winter wheat
harvest of 2.09 billion bushels, a 44% jump from last year's
weather-damaged crop.
   The projection for the biggest winter-wheat crop since
1981, based on a May 1 survey, is likely to trigger a plunge
in wheat futures prices today because most market analysts
had anticipated a decidedly smaller increase in production.
Many had expected the department to project production at
1.96 billion bushels, 35% above the 1.45 billion in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a separate report on global supply and demand, the
department said that it expects corn farmers to harvest 8.1
billion bushels this year, up nearly 8% from last year. But
gains in corn use may outpace gains in production and thus
keep corn stockpiles tight, the department said.
   At the same time, the department said that world wheat
production is likely to rise 6% to a record level in the
marketing year beginning July 1, with increases predicted for
the Soviet Union, European Community, China and Canada as
well as the U.S.
   Department analysts also predicted record yields for the
1990 grain crop in the Soviet Union, primarily because of
favorable weather conditions. They forecast a grain harvest
of 215 million tons, up nearly four million tons from 1989.
But they said the Soviets will continue importing large
amounts of grain if they can obtain financing for corn and
wheat purchases. "Soviet credit needs will likely continue
heavy," they said in a Soviet outlook report.
   The Soviets are expected to import 36 million tons of
grain in 1990-91, only slightly less than the two previous
marketing years. The imports are likely to include 15 million
tons of wheat and 20 million tons of corn and other coarse
grains. Much of the grain will be used to feed livestock as
part of the Kremlin's efforts to improve the Soviet diet with
more meat.
   Wheat prices have been unsteady for several weeks because
of forecasts that the winter wheat crop in the Southern
Plains was improving rapidly. The government estimate,
however, greatly exceeds the conventional wisdom of private
forecasters.
   "It was higher than the highest conceivable guess," said
Walter Spilka, a grain analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co., New York.
   The winter wheat harvest is under way in Texas. If the
national harvest materializes as projected by the Agriculture
Department, stockpiles would begin refilling from their
lowest levels in 15 years.
   While total wheat stockpiles by mid-1991 would still be
roughly half the level that was common before the previous
two years of drought, they still could help put a damper on
food inflation. U.S. food prices rose 5.8% last year in large
part because drought slashed U.S. crops.
   Corn prices also are expected to falter at the opening of
trading today. Moreover, the corn harvest actually might be
larger than the 8.1 billion bushels the department projected.
The department based its estimate on a two-month-old survey
of farmers' planting intentions. Grain analysts speculate
that a rally in corn prices since then probably spurred
growers to plant as much as two million more acres in corn,
which could add roughly 240 million bushels to the harvest.
   On the basis of its May 1 survey, the department predicted
that 50.8 million acres of winter wheat, which were planted
last fall, will be harvested by the end of July, up 23% from
last summer. Winter wheat accounts for three-fourths of the
nation's wheat production; the rest consist of spring wheat
and durum wheat.
   Winter wheat yields are expected to average 41.1 bushels
an acre, up six bushels from 1989 when drought and frost
damage in Kansas and other Plains states cut sharply into
yields. The department described the condition of the Kansas
crop as good-to-excellent and predicted a harvest of 460.2
million bushels, a remarkable rebound from 213.6 million last
year.

   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange reported its
lowest earnings of the past five years.
   The Big Board said its net income in 1989 dropped 39% to
$6.3 million from $10.4 million in 1988. Revenue at the
exchange increased 7.9% to $349.3 million. But expenses
surged 12% to $339.2 million, partly because of an upgrading
of technology for trading and surveillance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To rein in expenses, the Big Board recently imposed a
hiring freeze and has tried to reduce costs and increase
certain fees. A spokeswoman declined to comment on hiring or
budgetary matters.
   The Big Board could face another profit squeeze this year.
The exchange had predicted that daily average volume would
amount to about 166 million shares this year. Through the end
of April, daily average volume on the Big Board amounted to
154.7 million. Lower trading volume generally cuts into the
exchange's fee income.
   Nonetheless, there are plenty of signs that the exchange
remains vital. Some 41.6 billion shares traded at the Big
Board last year, the second highest volume in the exchange's
history. The number of listed companies rose to 1,721, an
all-time high.
   However, return on members' equity fell to 2.7%, the
second year of low, single-digit returns. Working capital at
the exchange fell to $108.9 million from $114 million in
1988.
   At the American Stock Exchange, net income rose 64% to
$4.2 million in 1989 from $2.6 million the previous year.
Revenue at the Amex rose 6.7% to $109.6 million from $102.7
million in 1988, partly because of gains in transaction and
clearance charges. Expenses grew 3.6% to $102.8 million last
year from $99.2 million in 1988.
   The Amex traded 3.1 billion shares last year, the second
highest share volume ever, compared with 2.5 billion in 1988.
A center of options trading, the Amex traded 49.8 million
stock options contracts, up from 45 million in 1988.
   "The outlook for 1990 is good," said James Jones, Amex
chairman. He said first-quarter net income was $1.2 million,
while trading volume in the period was up 31% from a year
earlier.

   The luxury car unit of auto maker Volkswagen AG, which
Wednesday said its group profit climbed 33% in 1989, said the
pretax profit margin climbed to 5.2% from 3.6% a year
earlier.

   Audi said that in the first quarter world-wide sales rose
0.7% to 105,327 vehicles. Domestic unit sales, however,
declined 0.7% to 39,351. Audi said its domestic market share
fell to 5.3% from 5.7%.
   In the U.S., unit sales climbed 7% to 4,949 in the first
quarter. But Wednesday, Volkswagen Chairman Carl H. Hahn said
that in the first four months, Audi unit sales had risen 14%,
suggesting sales jumped sharply in April.
   Sales in the U.S. had been hurt in recent years by
since-discredited allegations that Audi cars had spontaneous
acceleration problems. Signs that Audi's U.S. sales had
turned the corner emerged in 1989.

   Facing shareholders who expressed displeasure over Sears's

   Thomas E. Jones, executive vice president for financial
control, tax and auditing, said in an interview that
deteriorating conditions in commercial real estate markets
largely are responsible for the rise.

   He added that the $500 million to $600 million was based
largely on the New York-based bank's "feel" for where the
market is headed and isn't an estimate.
   Such an increase would be in line with Citicorp's
first-quarter results when nonperforming commercial real
estate loans rose to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion at the
end of 1989.
   As of March 31, Citicorp had $7.5 billion in nonperforming
loans out of a total portfolio of $160 billion. Of that,
about $3.3 million are domestic loans, including $1.3 billion
of problem loans on commercial real estate projects.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Citicorp rose 37.5 cents a share to close at $22.75.

   Centex Telemanagement Seen as Vulnerable
   To Phone Rate Restructuring in California

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- A moment of truth is nearing for Centex
Telemanagement.
   The highflying, San Francisco-based telephone service
company has captured the heart of Wall Street ever since
going public in 1987. Earnings and revenue have risen
sharply. Cash on hand has risen to $27 million. Long-term
debt is naught.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But developments in California's regulatory environment
are casting a shadow over Centex's bread-and-butter business.
   Centex is like few other companies. It is part middleman,
part consultant, part telephone service manager. In return
for a fee, Centex links small businesses to the local
telephone company and routes customer calls over any of the
various lines and services offered by the local company as
well as AT&amp;T, MCI and others.
   Until now, Centex has benefited from an anomaly in
California's rates. Pacific Bell has a lock on the toll calls
within each local telephone area, such as from San Jose to
San Francisco. For California's small users, such local toll
calls are far more expensive than in other states. In fact,
Los Angelenos can talk to New Yorkers more cheaply than to
many of their in-state neighbors.
   Centex has prospered by buying telephone service at the
bulk rates available to large users and offering savings to
small businesses. But California is restructuring rates. The
state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to open up
local toll calls to competition and to cut rates by as much
as 30% to 40%.
   What's more, Pacific Bell asserts that Centex, among
others, rents a type of dial tone service at a price below
Pacific Bell's cost. Though Centex disputes this, some of
Centex's costs could well be raised. A PUC draft decision on
rate restructuring is expected this summer.
   David Shantz, a program manager in the PUC's Division of
Ratepayer Advocates, which represents telephone users, says,
"Centex is what I call a price arbitrager. As toll rates come
down, the ability of Centex to compete will diminish."
   Amy Newmark, an analyst with Homans McGraw Trull Valeo &amp;
Co., sees "a major negative impact." Centex "won't be the
only game in town" for customers seeking an alternative to
Pacific Bell, and there will be less reason to seek such an
alternative, she says.
   Peter Howley, an MCI and AT&amp;T veteran who is chairman of
Centex, concedes that the changes in California might
adversely affect some of Centex's business, but he says that
in the long run Centex will benefit from increased
competition. Moreover, he asserts that the savings Centex
offers on California toll calls are a small part of its
appeal.
   Although 80% of its billings are in California, Centex is
expanding on the East Coast. And Mr. Howley, in general,
plays down Centex's appeal as a discounter. "Five years ago,
it was easy to show a big saving," he says. Today, as long
distance competition heats up, analysts say the saving has
probably diminished.
   Mr. Howley doesn't dispute this. He says Centex's basic
appeal is that it relieves small companies of the burden of
picking a carrier and of managing its phones. In a favored
phrase, Centex provides a "single point of contact" for a
customer's telephonic needs. That is intended to ring
nostalgic with those yearning for the simplicity of the Ma
Bell era.
   Centex also offers various teleservices, such as reports
allocating a customer's calls to the customer's various
clients. James Hickey, an analyst with William Blair, says,
"They are that friendly voice you used to hear when you
called AT&amp;T."
   Jerry Oliver, a specialist on regulatory matters for Pac
Bell, agrees that Centex has carved out a niche as a
"telemanager."
   But analysts say it costs Centex more time and money to
market to clients on the basis of service, rather than on
price. And while the company is upbeat about its expansion in
the East, analysts say Centex has yet to achieve the
economies of scale -- or the profit margins -- that it has in
California. Certainly, Centex's profit would seem to be
highly vulnerable to regulatory changes in its home state.
   Ms. Newmark asserts that "telemanaging" requires no hard
assets and little technology or capital. Thus, she wonders
why, if the business is so good, Centex has yet to attract
much competition. Since the barrier to entry would seem to be
low, Ms. Newmark says Centex's stock should trade at a modest
multiple of earnings.
   Tom Barton, a partner of Feshbach Brothers, which has sold
short some Centex stock, betting that it will drop, says,
"Centex's real game is rate arbitrage, and this game is
over." Mr. Barton could be wrong. But with Centex's stock
selling at 23 times estimates for 1990 earnings, investors
have a great deal to lose if he is right.

never had any intention of making a tender offer for Cummins
shares and vowed to "pursue a harmonious relationship with
Cummins." Brierley is used by Sir Ronald Brierley of New
Zealand to make British and U.S. investments.
   "We bought our shares of Cummins as an investment and
never intended to take any of the actions we have now
contractually agreed not to take," said Mr. Hancox.
   Privately, Cummins claimed victory.
   "Maybe the heat was getting such that IEP had to back
off," said one person familiar with Cummins's dealings with
IEP. "They apparently just decided that life is too short for
all this." Cummins had brought in congressional and
regulatory scrutiny of the stock purchases.
   In seeking the agreement, IEP had asked for, but been
denied, a role on a shareholders advisory committee as part
of dropping the litigation, this person said. Instead,
Cummins agreed only to "meet with IEP twice a year in
Columbus, Ind."
   "Of course, we didn't say who we'd have at the meeting,"
said the person from the Cummins side.
   "I think Industrial Equity got a little more than they
bargained for," said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. "Cummins management has pretty much
entrenched themselves."
   "We got tired of the litigation," said Rob Sutherland, an
IEP director and head of its California office. "We just
couldn't find it worthwhile spending months and months in
depositions when we have better things to do."
   It's also possible IEP lost whatever appetite, if any, it
had for more Cummins stock. Cummins traded as high as $65
last July, when IEP more than doubled its stake, but by
October the stock had dropped sharply as Cummins's earnings
flagged. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading
yesterday, Cummins dropped 62.5 cents to $46.50.
   IEP is the second big shareholder whose advances the
diesel engine maker has turned away. Last July, descendants
of Cummins's founding family bought Hanson USA's 8.8% stock
holdings to rid Cummins of that shareholder.

   British Telecommunications PLC, London, said it plans to
eliminate 4,000 to 5,000 middle-management jobs as part of a
previously announced corporate reorganization to cut costs.
   The job cuts in a workforce of about 244,000 are the first
in what Britain's main telephone company says will be a
steady shedding of jobs over the next few years as fewer
workers are needed because of technological improvements.

   Also as part of the reorganization, the company named Mike
Bett, 55-year-old managing director of its main U.K.
subsidiary, to the newly created post of vice chairman
effective Oct. 1.
   Deep job cuts and public boardroom shuffles are relatively
new experiences for British Telecom, a former state telephone
monopoly privatized in 1984. In the past few years, pressure
for job cuts has been growing inside the company despite

   The Rosenwald group, which last month said it intended to

   The group also agreed that for three years it will not
acquire any additional shares of Grove stock, with the
exception that one member of the group, Mr. Sullivan, may
acquire up to an additional 5,000 shares.
   The agreement also provides that the company will consider
increasing its dividend and repurchasing its shares in the
public market in an effort to enhance shareholder value.

   Hershey Foods Corp. signed a definitive agreement to sell
its 17% equity stake in AB Marabou, a Swedish confectionary
company, to Orkla Borregaard A.S. for more than $75 million.
Orkla is a Norwegian concern with interests in consumer
packaged goods, chemicals and communications.
   The Hershey, Pa., company said it expects the sale to
result in a one-time aftertax gain of more than $35 million,
or 39 cents a share. The gain from the sale, which requires
approval from the Swedish and Norwegian governments, will
most likely be applied to second-quarter results, said a
company spokesman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Freia AS, a major Norwegian shareholder of Marabou, is in
the midst of a tender offer for those shares of Marabou it
doesn't own. The spokesman said Hershey decided not to tender
its shares because Orkla offered about $12 million more for
the food company's stake, which carries 20% of the voting
rights. "It's called maximizing shareholder value," he said.

   Nordstrom Inc., hurt by slower-than-anticipated sales and
higher expenses, said profit in the fiscal first quarter
plunged almost 43%.
   The Seattle retailer, which recently reported its first
annual profit decline since going public in 1971, said net
income in the period ended April 30 fell to $13.2 million, or
16 cents a share, from $23 million, or 28 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales rose 8.4% to $555 million from $512.2
million. But analysts said sales at stores open at least a
year inched up only 1.5% in the period -- and actually fell
in April.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results, which were worse than Wall Street expected,
were released after the stock market closed.
   Nordstrom attributed its sluggish sales partly to
difficulties it encountered in maintaining appropriate
inventory levels. Earnings fell, the company said, because it
reduced its merchandise markup in an attempt to make its
prices more competitive. Expenses also rose for other
reasons, some of which Nordstrom said were related to its
contract dispute with a union representing clerks and other
employees at Nordstrom's Seattle-area stores.

   Fairchild Industries Unit Is Charged
   With Producing Fake Data on Jet Parts

   A Fairchild Industries Inc. unit systematically generated
fraudulent testing documents for special nuts, bolts and
other fasteners used on most U.S. commercial jetliners and
military aircraft, federal prosecutors charged.
   The charges stem from an investigation following a weekend
raid in February 1989 of Fairchild's VSI Corp. fastener plant
in California by about 20 agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service.
Agents hauled away about 50 boxes of fasteners and documents
as part of an extensive inquiry into allegations of fraud in
the aerospace-parts industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The charges, brought against Fairchild's Voi-Shan testing
laboratory in Chatsworth, Calif., and two of its managers,
are contained in a complaint filed earlier this week in
federal court in Seattle by Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce D.
Carter.
   According to the complaint, a phantom "Inspector 11" at
the California plant was part of a 15-year scheme to falsify
test reports submitted to the government. Affidavits
supporting the complaint said the No. 11 inspector's stamp
wasn't assigned to any employee, but instead was used
routinely to indicate that parts had passed inspection, even
when tests hadn't been performed.
   In a statement filed in court along with the indictment,
Mr. Carter said some inadequate Voi-Shan parts were found,
but investigators still don't know if there is any imminent
air-safety concern from untested or possibly defective parts
used years earlier on aircraft flying today. "No accidents
have been traced to Voi-Shan bolts," he said in the
statement.
   Voi-Shan is the largest of Fairchild's three fastener
operations. The unit makes pins and collars, lock bolts,
rivets, nuts and other special fastener products. Some bolts
made at the plant are intended to bear loads exceeding
200,000 pounds per square inch. Customers include such major
aircraft and engine manufacturers as Boeing Co., McDonnell
Douglas Corp., Lockheed Corp., General Electric Co. and
United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney Co. unit.
   At Fairchild headquarters in Chantilly, Va., a spokeswoman
said she couldn't comment on the charges, because the company
is negotiating with the Justice Department to "resolve" the
civil and criminal allegations. "We believe a resolution is
imminent," she said.
   The spokeswoman also said Fairchild is confident that the
quality of its products has never jeopardized air safety. She
indicated that Fairchild would issue an additional statement
today after a court hearing in Seattle on the matter.
   According to the charges, the investigation of Voi-Shan
was prompted by a complaint from a whistleblower, Thomas
Runion, shortly after he left his job in the metallurgical
laboratory at the Chatsworth plant.
   The complaint also names as defendants James E. Ryan, a
former Voi-Shan quality-assurance manager, and Aram
Marderian, a former metallurgical lab supervisor for
Voi-Shan. If convicted, each faces a maximum sentence of five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Neither man could be reached for comment.
   The Fairchild unit and the former employees are charged
with conspiracy to commit mail fraud, to make false
statements to the government and to cheat the U.S. According
to court documents, the object of the alleged conspiracy was
to hold down costs of inspection and testing in order to
boost the unit's profits.
   The documents cite dozens of instances in which Voi-Shan
allegedly failed to conduct tests of strength, durability and
brittleness, and yet produced reports approved by the
fictitious inspector indicating that such tests had been
properly performed.
   Nevertheless, court documents indicate, Voi-Shan allegedly
shipped parts that were later rejected by aircraft makers
which subjected the products to their own testing procedures.
According to an affidavit, Fairchild also shipped some parts
that had rusted in a salt-spray test.
   Eight other defendants already have pleaded guilty in the
case, prosecutors said, and the investigation is continuing.
   In a prepared statement, Boeing said its use of Voi-Shan
materials "has not compromised the integrity of Boeing
products."
   Comments from other major Voi-Shan customers weren't
immediately available.

   NEW YORK -- Within reason, brokerage houses in the
Journal-Zacks study of stock-picking prowess may choose the
list of stocks on which they will be judged. (Of course, they
must specify in advance.)
   Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and Raymond James are judged by
the stocks their analysts rate "1" on a five-point scale.
Kidder Peabody is judged by stocks rated "1"or "2." A.G.
Edwards is judged by stocks analysts say to "buy" or
"accumulate."

   Starting at the end of January, Prudential-Bache began
publishing a weekly list giving each analyst's "single best
idea." It's judged on that, with sell ideas excluded. (For
January it was judged on stocks rated "1" for either short or
long term, and no lower than "2" for any term.)
   At four firms -- Dean Witter, Goldman Sachs, Shearson and
Smith Barney, a stock-selection committee reviews analysts'
recommendations and picks a select group of stocks as the
firm's official recommended list. Those firms are judged on
the committee's list.
   The study assumes that an investor buys the recommended
stocks, and sells all others, even if they're designated as
holds or weak buys. Equal dollar amounts are put into each
stock, and portfolios are adjusted monthly to keep the
amounts equal. All buying and selling is on the last trading
day of each month. Commissions and taxes are disregarded,
mostly to make the results comparable to market indexes.
Dividends are included.
   Brokerage houses are given a chance to check the data for
accuracy. All 10 firms did so this quarter.

   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index soared 43.15
points, the best gain in more than two months, to close at
2985.42. The broader Hong Kong Index jumped 28.82, to
1961.32. Turnover shot up to 1.46 billion Hong Kong dollars
(US$187.5 million) from Wednesday's HK$1.07 billion.
   Properties shares outpaced the rest of the market. They
were followed by commercial and industrial issues. Utilities
issues posted substantial advances, while banking stocks made
modest increases.
   After opening unchanged, the market was stuck in tight
range-trading in the morning. The impact of the news from
China involving the release of the dissidents took hold in
the afternoon to vault the market to close just off the
intraday high, participants said.
   Players said overseas funds were back in force to snap up
quality blue chips, while speculative interest in various
industrial second liners also heated up.
   "Trading momentum improved significantly, and healthy
follow-through is almost certain Friday," said Simon Chin,
research director at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers HK Ltd.
   There has been a lot of pent-up buying interest lately, a
trader said, pointing to the lack of selling pressure during
the recent consolidation period as evidence.
   Participants say the market should have no problem
piercing the key 3000 level on the blue-chip index Friday,
but they differ on whether it can stay above that point. A
trader at a major European brokerage firm said it could, and
set the next target at the 3050 level. Mr. Chin is less
certain and said it remains to be seen, as previous attempts
this year to breach that point eventually failed.
   In London, the FT-SE 100-share index fell 5.7 points to
2157.0, its intraday low. The index hit a session high of
2169.2, up 6.5, in late morning dealings. At the close, the
FT 30-share index was down 4.8 at 1690.8. Volume was 406.3
million shares, down from 425 million shares a day earlier.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index was at
2194.0, up from 2190.0.
   A spate of gloomy corporate news peppered the market --
from profit warnings to poor quarterly results. Dealers noted
that the news was reflected in the day's big FTSE 100
decliners.
   As well, dealers said that the mixed bag of price action
on the day reflected a degree of profit-taking before the
expiration of the exchange's current two-week trading account
Friday, along with reluctance to aggressively take fresh
positions so late in the trading account.
   Dealers added that the market has grown increasingly
cautious ahead of Friday's scheduled release of British
retail price index data, particularly given talk that it will
show Britain's inflation rate moving into double-digits for
the first time since early 1982.
   Among the bearish corporate news that helped undermine the
market, automotive-parts maker GKN issued a grim profit
statement around midday that clipped early gains. GKN plunged
31 pence, to 366 pence ($6.14) a share, after reporting a
decline in pretax profit for the first four months of the
year as a result of sagging demand and labor strikes
affecting some of its key customers.
   Shares took another tumble late in the session, after the
release of disappointing first-quarter results from General
Accident, Britain's largest composite insurer. General
Accident fell 14, to 1026, after reporting an #80.9 million
($135.8 million) pretax loss for the first quarter. It cited
winter-storm claims and a deterioration in the underlying
business in most of its major markets.
   British Petroleum fell 5, to 311. Britain's largest
petroleum company said net income dropped 43% on a historic
cost basis, with depressed chemical earnings and a drop in
value of its inventory countering strong earnings growth in
exploration and production.
   Tokyo had a bullish opening tied to buying inspired by a
stronger yen. But partly because it was expiration day for
May options, arbitragers actively liquidated their cash stock
against short futures positions in the afternoon.
   As a result, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues
closed 34.65 points higher at 30980.26. The index fell 24.97
points Wednesday. Volume on the first section was estimated
at 730 million shares, down from 753.5 million shares
Wednesday.
   In trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 185.68
points to 31165.94 at the end of the morning session.
   Thursday's Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in
the first section, which gained 5.19 points Wednesday, rose
4.06 points, or 0.18%, at 2312.85.
   The second-section index, which advanced 46.02 points
Wednesday, rose 38.25 Thursday, or 1.03%, to close at
3756.15.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at 19 million
shares, up from 18.6 million shares Wednesday.
   The key Nikkei index gained more than 295 points to its
intraday high in the morning, as buyers were inspired to seek
out domestic-demand related issues on the back of a stronger
yen, according to J. Graham Biggart, head of futures and
options trading at Schroder Securities (Japan) Ltd. But the
currency's strength induced some profit-taking on high-tech,
export-oriented issues, Mr. Biggart said.
   Greg Byndy, manager of equity trading at Merrill Lynch
Japan Inc., said afternoon activity was dictated by
options-related strategies.
   Although some futures and options traders didn't expect
much arbitrage activity Thursday afternoon, Mr. Byndy said
that most had anticipated the selling on the cash indexes, as
it usually occurs on options expiration day.
   The buying on the strength of the yen, then, was negated
by arbitrage selling.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 623 to 348
Thursday.
   Profit-taking brought down prices of high-tech shares,
steels and shipbuildings, which have mostly been gaining for
the past week. Sony closed at 8440, up 20, after trading as
high as 8500. Matsushita Electric Industrial fell 40 to 2220
and Toshiba fell 10 to 1070. Nippon Steel fell 15 to 605 and
Nisshin Steel fell 12 to 913.
   Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange disclosed data on
arbitrage positions for the week ended May 2. Stocks being
held against June stock-index futures totaled 424.9 million
shares, up 3.6 million from the previous week. The market
value of shares against stock-index futures was 600.17
billion yen ($3.83 billion), up 16.79 billion yen from the
week earlier.
   In other market activity:
   Share prices closed higher in Stockholm and Zurich; lower
in Amsterdam and Brussels; and mixed in Frankfurt, Paris and
Milan. South African gold stocks closed firmer.
   Share prices were higher in Singapore, and were lower in
Manila, Seoul, Sydney, Taipei and Wellington.

   Viacom Inc. posted strong first-quarter sales growth and a
net loss that was much narrower than the operating loss in
the year-ago period, when net income was boosted sharply by
one-time gains on sales of cable systems.
   Viacom's operating earnings more than doubled in its
cable-networks division, which includes MTV. Double-digit
revenue and earnings increases were posted in each of the
company's three other divisions: local cable systems; TV and
radio stations; and program production and syndication.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company posted a first-quarter loss of $17.1 million,
or 32 cents a share, on 15% growth in revenue, to $393.2
million. The year-ago period had revenue of $341.1 million,
an operating loss of $80.8 million and net income of $199.1
million, or $3.73 a share, thanks to a pretax profit boost of
$304.8 million from the sale of cable systems in Cleveland
and Long Island.
   Viacom also expanded its bank lines of credit in the
quarter by $200 million, to $1.7 billion, to add flexibility
in managing its debt load and in making small acquisitions,
said George S. Smith Jr., chief financial officer.
   The firm's cash flow improved considerably. In the most
recent period Viacom generated cash flow of $99 million to
cover interest payments of $70.8 million, some of which was
"in kind" rather than in actual cash. That compares with
year-earlier cash flow of $86 million to cover $96.1 million
in interest.

   The board of Hilton Hotels Corp., regrouping from its

hotel and casino company's assets, boosted the company's
quarterly common stock dividend 20% to 30 cents a share from
25 cents. The dividend is payable June 15 to shareholders of
record June 1.
   Barron Hilton, chairman and chief executive, said in an
interview before the annual shareholders' meeting that the
company is assessing the casino market in Atlantic City, N.J.
Recent Wall Street rumors have suggested that Hilton is
interested in buying Trump's Castle from New York investor
Donald Trump. Mr. Hilton said the company isn't in
negotiations with anyone, but said the company would consider
the Castle and other properties as well.
</LP>

   Hilton built the Castle in 1984, but the company suffered
a stunning reversal when its licensing application was
rejected by state casino officials. Hilton sold the Castle to
Mr. Trump in 1985, who opened the property that June. Hilton
and Mr. Trump filed suit against one another over the closing
of the sale, but the claims later were dismissed.
   Hilton's stock closed at $48.125, down 62.5 cents in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.

   WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors investigating Rep.
Joseph McDade (R., Pa.) obtained an indictment charging the
lawmaker's former top aide with racketeering, conspiracy and
tax violations.
   The eight felony charges against Raymond Wittig, Rep.
McDade's primary link to a minority defense contractor,
indicate that prosecutors have stepped up their inquiry into
whether the veteran GOP lawmaker accepted illegal campaign
contributions and gratuities from officials of the company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the Philadelphia federal court indictment, Mr. Wittig
was charged, among other things, with conspiring to funnel
bribes and gratuities to public officials who helped the
now-defunct United Chem-Con Corp. secure and maintain federal
contracts over the years. The indictment doesn't identify any
of those officials, but some of the charges parallel
allegations against the congressman first raised in a
December 1988 front-page story in The Wall Street Journal.
   Rep. McDade, Mr. Wittig and their lawyers couldn't be
reached for comment. In the past, Rep. McDade has maintained
that he hasn't violated any laws and said his efforts on
behalf of United Chem-Con were intended to keep jobs in his
district. Mr. Wittig has acknowledged soliciting campaign
gifts and other favors for Rep. McDade from company
officials, but has denied any wrongdoing.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Harbist, who has headed
the two-year Philadelphia grand jury investigation, said only
that the inquiry is continuing.
   If convicted on all counts, Mr. Wittig faces a maximum of
41 years in jail and a $1.4 million fine.

   ABB Asea Is Said
   To Set Unit's Sale

   ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd took a step toward digesting its
recent acquisition of Combustion Engineering Inc. by agreeing
to sell Georgia Kaolin Co. for about $525 million, according
to sources familiar with the transaction.
   The buyer is ECC Group PLC, formerly English China Clays
PLC, based in Cornwall, England, which plans to add Georgia
Kaolin's line of paper pigments to its industrial minerals
business. Kaolin, also known as China clay, is used to give
magazine pages a glossy sheen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement, which is subject to U.S. antitrust
clearance and other regulatory approvals, is expected to be
announced in London this morning.
   ABB, the world's largest electrical engineering company
with more than $25 billion in estimated sales, acquired
Combustion Engineering late last year for about $1.6 billion
to bolster its U.S. presence in its main business of making
equipment used to generate and transmit electrical power.
   The Zurich, Switzerland, concern is selling Georgia
Kaolin, which has three plants in Georgia, because the
industrial pigments business doesn't fit with its main
power-plant business. ABB is co-owned by BBC Brown Boveri AG
of Switzerland and Asea AB of Sweden.
   ECC, which has annual sales of about $1.6 billion, already
has some operations in Georgia. Georgia Kaolin had pretax
profit of about $41 million in 1989 on sales of roughly $170
million.
   ABB is being advised on the sale by First Boston Corp., a
unit of CS First Boston Group Inc. ECC is advised by J. Henry
Schroder Wagg &amp; Co. in London.
   ECC plans to finance the purchase with a three-year
borrowing of about $600 million, which it may refinance with
longer-term securities later. It doesn't expect to use an
equity rights offering as financing.
   ECC also plans a $200 million preferred stock issue and
intends to sell certain businesses to raise roughly #100
million ($167.9 million) more by the end of 1991. ECC doesn't
expect the acquisition to dilute its earnings in the first
full year after completion, and it should boost operating
profit in 1991.

   Body and Soul:
   Is It Possible to Die of a Broken Heart?
   New Research Suggests That It May Be
   ----

<LP>
   "I AM SICK AT HEART," said Hamlet.
   Who among us hasn't been? Who among us hasn't noticed that
when we are tranquil, our hearts tick peacefully? Or that
when we are excited or frightened, this muscle pounds
violently in our chests?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet surprisingly, the medical establishment has only
recently begun paying more attention to the connection
between emotions and the heart. It's not surprising, they
say, that the symptoms of a panic attack -- an emotionally
traumatic event -- closely parallel those of a heart attack:
chest pains, shortness of breath and nausea.
   Researchers, for instance, are learning more about the
precise way in which stress can damage arteries. They are
developing new models for the type of personality likely to
develop heart disease. And they are advising doctors to treat
-- and be aware of -- patients' emotional, as well as
physical, symptoms.
   One relatively new area of exploration is how the heart
itself can rule our emotions. Researchers know that the
heart, like the brain, stores neurochemicals and hormones of
the sort that help send messages through the nervous system.
The heart occasionally releases such agents into the
bloodstream. This may affect other organs, including the
brain, although researchers aren't sure how.
   "It's suspected but not proven that the heart is a central
command place that mobilizes in time of trouble," says
Stephen Weiss, a heart researcher at the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute. "The heart and nervous system {are} all
part of a reverberating circuit with the heart sometimes
directing emotional states."
   A sick heart, for instance, can send emotional warning
signals. Redford Williams, a heart researcher at Duke
University, says that before a heart attack -- and sometimes
right after -- people feel "a sense of doom, despair and
depression." It's believed those feelings may be related to a
poorly functioning heart that isn't pumping as much blood as
usual. "It isn't hard to see how the rest of the body could
perceive this as something wrong," says Dr. Williams.
   Doctors have a better understanding of how emotions
originating in the brain affect the heart. The brain sends
messages to receptors in the heart via the nervous system.
These nerve impulses are analogous to a car engine's power
being transmitted to the wheels. The receptors near the heart
act as both clutch and brake to keep the brain's stronger
impulses from, among other things, fueling the heart into a
pumping frenzy. Heart-attack victims often have nervous
systems that do a poor job of calming themselves.
   When we are scared or angry, nerve impulses also cause
adrenaline, a stimulating hormone, to flow. In response,
blood vessels in the kidneys and near the skin constrict and
muscles get bigger as the body prepares for trouble. The
neurochemicals and hormones triggered by what cardiologists
call "the fight or flight response" are largely used up in
stimulating muscles to high performance.
   But not always. An increasingly popular theory holds that
these chemicals are toxic and that their cumulative effect
causes long-term damage to the arteries. Recent experiments
with monkeys done jointly by Wake Forest University and the
University of Pittsburgh show that emotional stress from the
brain can cause plaque to form on the arteries of some
animals.
   Researchers made the discovery on monkeys who were moved
frequently into new cages, where they were forced to
establish new relationships and be socially aggressive. The
result: arterial plaque. Adding fat to the diet of such
monkeys accelerated the formation of arterial plaque. But
monkeys who exercised by walking on treadmills didn't add
arterial plaque -- presumably because their muscles were
using up the toxic neurochemicals and hormones.
   "If more research proves all this to be true, we're on our
way to understanding the differences between physical and
emotional stress," says Dr. Weiss at the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute. "This is an exciting area but one where
we don't have the answers."
   The accumulation of stress-related plaque on the arteries
may be one reason people with certain temperaments are more
likely to die of a heart attack than others. Thus, the big
emotional blowup we so often associate with a heart attack
may be "just the last straw," says Dr. Weiss. Some people may
be overreacting to events dozens of times a day -- each time
contributing to heart problems down the road.
   At the same time, however, doctors have substantially
refined what sort of emotions they think are harmful. One of
the biggest changes is the abandonment of old theories about
the doomed "Type A" personality: the hard-driving, obsessed
workaholic who puts in 70 hours a week. No longer is this
personality by itself seen as being a great risk of coronary
disease. In fact, more recent studies have shown that the
hardest workers may be the healthiest.
   Instead, medical fears are now focusing on those who give
up on their dreams in life and love. "The person who's out of
danger isn't necessarily the one who quits the company to
sell daisies on the roadside. It's the one who's solving
problems at his job and feeling needed by his wife and
children," says Robert S. Eliot, a cardiologist who is
chairman of the Institute of Stress Medicine in Denver.
   Bernard Lown, professor of cardiology at Harvard School of
Public Health, says he learned this lesson the hard way --
from the death of patients. One such man, a 36-year-old truck
driver, complained of chest pains on the job even though he
climbed mountains on vacation without discomfort. "He was
angry about the contradiction in his life -- being bright and
quitting school to end up in a job he didn't like," says Dr.
Lown. He died suddenly at the wheel of his truck.
   Another of Dr. Lown's patients complained of chest pain
whenever his phone rang at about 10 a.m., the hour when he
previously received word of his son's death. The patient
eventually had a fatal heart attack one morning when the
phone rang.
   Physicians must minister more carefully to the emotions of
patients, says Dean Ornish, a cardiovascular researcher at
the University of California School of Medicine at San
Francisco. He notes that 50% of heart-attack victims die in
the first 24 hours. He wonders whether impersonal treatment
in emergency rooms -- with cold catheters and cool
calculations by doctors -- unnecessarily raises patients'
anxieties and hurts their chances for survival.
   "The heart-attack patient typically suffers depression --
a sense of doom and loss," says Dr. Ornish. "They're deeply
personal feelings that the poets have felt but medical
science just can't explain. Emergency treatment has to do
more to relieve the sense of fear and helplessness."
   Feelings of powerlessness can bring on a heart attack,
recent research shows. A Harvard study of 117 victims of
sudden coronary death shows that 25 had "trigger events"
within 24 hours of the heart attack. They included a man
giving a speech being jeered by his audience, a man whose
wife surprised him with a divorce request, and a patient who
became enraged in a traffic jam.
   Indeed, many doctors now believe that emotional stresses
are far more likely to trigger a heart attack than are
physical demands. In a study of 28- to 35-year-old aerospace
engineers at Cape Canaveral, their rate of death was three
times higher than the rate for the rest of Florida's
population, including retirees. The mysterious deaths even
attracted attention from the Central Intelligence Agency,
suspecting sabotage. But researchers learned the engineers
were dying after major rocket launches, when layoffs
sometimes occur.
   "One week they're working on rockets and the next week
they're bagging groceries," says the Institute of Stress
Medicine's Dr. Eliot, who studied the engineers. "I found
that in most of the deceased, the coronary arteries were in
pretty good shape."
   But he also discovered ruptures of heart-muscle fibers
that other researchers have duplicated in animal experiments
with overdoses of adrenaline, a stress hormone. Among other
things, adrenaline constricts arteries in the arms and leg;
it's the reason your hands may feel cold in stressful times,
and it's the principle that allows "stress cards" to change
color as blood vessels tighten and relax.
   Interviewing colleagues of the dead engineers, Dr. Eliot
learned that many of the heart-attack victims shared a fear
of losing four things: jobs, self-esteem, personal identities
and control of their lives.
   A momentary flare-up of disappointment and frustration is
more dangerous than fatigue from long hours or job pressure.
A recent study at Yale University shows that
heart-threatening stress has nothing to do with job
involvement or ambition. "The vulnerable ones are those who
become too annoyed at waiting in a restaurant line or being
seated near a cigar smoker when they get in," says Lynda
Powell, a psychologist and researcher at Yale. Her study of
people with recurring heart attacks shows they share
"annoyance, impatience . . . a feeling that there's someone
against them and there's a paucity of time."
   On the more hopeful side, there is now growing evidence
that stress-management techniques can reduce plaque in
partially clogged arteries. Findings last year by researchers
in Houston and San Francisco showed that meditation and talk
therapy reduced coronary-arterty blockages in a group of 24
patients -- some of whom had already had heart attacks.
   Still, much needs to be learned. Dr. Ornish says that not
enough research is under way on the emotions that affect the
heart-or how to control them-especially in comparison to the
work being done on diet and exercise. Adds Harvard's Dr.
Lown: "The public comes to the doctor with an aching heart .
. . a no-good son or a bad boss, and he often ignores it."

   GRANDVILLE, Mich. -- Despite a drop in first-quarter
earnings, X-Rite Corp. said it should meet an analyst's
prediction that 1990 net income will rise to more than $4
million, or about 80 cents a share, from $3.6 million, or 70
cents a share, the previous year.
   Ted Thompson, X-Rite chairman, president and chief
executive officer, says he is upbeat despite a lackluster
first quarter in which earnings fell 6.6% to $764,000, or 15
cents a share, from $818,000, or 16 cents a share, a year
earlier. Quarter revenue rose 10% to $5.5 million from $5
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   X-Rite has diversified from its original business of
developing tapes to mark X-rays, and currently derives 77% of
its $21.2 million in annual revenue from sales of
quality-control instruments, including color-measurement
instruments used in the graphic-arts industry.
   In December, X-Rite began rolling out a new line of
machines designed for broader industrial uses such as
measuring the colors of paints, fabrics, ceramics, floor
coverings. Mr. Thompson said the new instruments have been
well received, but it is too early to predict how they will
affect revenue and profit for the year.
   X-rite is nearly half owned by a group of insiders,
including Mr. Thompson. The company has no debt and about
$9.3 million in cash and short-term investments.
   X-rite recently raised its quarterly dividend to three
cents a share from two cents. Mr. Thompson doesn't want to
raise the dividend again, however, despite the substantial
cash position for a company its size. Instead, Mr. Thompson
wants to use the cash to finance a factory expansion as well
as inventory, marketing, and other costs associated with the
new line of instruments.

   Aura Systems Inc. Expects to Report
   Narrowed Loss for Fiscal Fourth Quarter

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Aura Systems Inc. expects to report
that its loss for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 28 narrowed
to between $250,000 and $300,000 from a loss of $552,000 a
year earlier, President Harry Kurtzman said.
   He said fourth-quarter revenue went to about $2 million
from $1 million a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the full year, Mr. Kurtzman said, the loss widened to
about $2 million, or 10 cents a share, from last year's loss
of $1.5 million, or seven cents a share, on a surge in
revenue to more than $9 million from $2.8 million a year ago.
   Mr. Kurtzman stressed that the revenue nearly all came
from research-and-development contracts, "almost equivalent
to investments," he said. "When most people talk about
revenue, they talk about selling something," he added. He
said the company would be manufacturing and delivering
products before the end of fiscal 1991, and said he expects
Aura to be profitable for the year.
   Chief Financial Officer Frank Phalen said the company had
received a contract from General Dynamics Corp. to develop
magnetic devices for an advanced reconnaissance system that
contains a commitment of about $1 million but could generate
revenue of more than $50 million over the next 10 years if
the devices later go into production.
   Mr. Kurtzman, in an interview, said he expects revenue to
double in the coming fiscal year, though he said two-thirds
of it would still be the research-and-development area. The
company was founded in 1987.
   Mr. Kurtzman also outlined progress in the electro-optical
and electromagnetic segments of Aura's business. The company
holds two patents on a technology it developed to "isolate"
equipment in an electromagnetic field, which eliminates
vibration. The process can be used to prevent "jitters" in
cameras on aircraft, and Mr. Kurtzman said the process also
has applications for vehicle shock absorbers, and stereo
speakers.
   Meanwhile, government research interest continues, Mr.
Kurtzman said. He said Aura is waiting for final governmental
approval of a $1.2 million contract with the U.S. Air Force
to use the high-resolution display system to test infrared
military sensors used in intelligence-gathering.
   Mr. Kurtzman said there are potential applications in the
entertainment business as well. The company's electro-optical
unit has five patents pending on a high definition television
system, and he said the company would announce a partnership
with an entertainment company soon.
   Aura has built a prototype for a projection system that
potentially could show films transmitted to movie theaters by
satellite or cable through a television signal, removing the
need for shipping numerous (and costly) film prints to
individual theaters. Aura's system purports to display this
television image on huge movie screens with film-like
resolution and brightness. Mr. Kurtzman said MCA Inc.,
Paramount Communications Inc., Sony Corp.'s Columbia
Pictures, AMC Entertainment Inc. and other companies have
expressed interest in the process.
   In the electromagnetic area, Mr. Kurtzman said the
company's technology could have applications for elevators in
tall buildings, to cut down lateral shaking. It could also be
used to prevent vibration and blurriness in film cameras that
ride on dollies. Aura is also studying the use of the process
in stereo speakers, where electromagnetism can convey
low-frequency, or bass, notes much lower than conventional
speakers can.
   The company also has an advanced computing and a
microelectronics division that together generated about $1
million in revenue in the past fiscal year, Mr. Kurtzman
said.

   L'Oreal's Preference Is to Shun Publicity
   ---
   But Chairman Breaks Silence
   To Discuss Outlook for Firm

   PARIS -- French cosmetics giant L'Oreal S.A. hates
publicity.
   This year, for example, when L'Oreal realized that a big
capital gain had pushed its 1989 net profit up 43%, it didn't
boast. It tried to hide the gain. It announced that net
profit had gone up 17.3% -- the growth rate before capital
gains. Reporters had to hunt through annual report tables to
find what many companies would have considered good news.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   L'Oreal considers that kind of discretion in keeping with
its position as the world's largest cosmetics company. It
prefers to appear a quietly ticking machine, turning in
regular profit growth. Despite its best efforts, however, it
still sometimes makes waves.
   In February it surprised the luxury-business world by
joining forces with the controversial Vuitton family to buy
control of the Lanvin fashion and perfume house. In previous
years, with its profits growing faster than its traditional
markets, it had sought diversification into the financial
futures market, magazine publishing and even movie-making.
Late in 1988, the conservative French concern, which still is
family-controlled, named as its new chairman a Welshman,
Lindsay Owen-Jones, a 21-year company veteran.
   Like many L'Oreal officials, Mr. Owen-Jones, a
youthful-looking 44-year-old, has a way of wincing when asked
a pointed question. He rarely gives interviews, and
acknowledges that he prefers to do so when there isn't much
new to report.
   But even L'Oreal can't keep entirely out of the public
eye. In one of those rare interviews a few days ago, Mr.
Owen-Jones agreed to discuss such questions as the Vuitton
alliance, Eastern Europe and the future of a company whose
principal family shareholders now are 65 or older.
   The Vuitton alliance was announced in February, when
L'Oreal and a group of investors including Cie. Financiere de
Paribas bought minority shares in a Vuitton family-controlled
holding company called Orcofi SA. They said they hoped to
make Orcofi a new French luxury group. As a first step,
L'Oreal and Orcofi together bought 95% control of Lanvin,
each taking equal stakes.
   The move was controversial for two reasons. First, the
Vuittons seemed to be upping the ante in their power struggle
with the management of competing luxury group LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The Vuitton family still holds a
large minority stake in Moet Vuitton, and has been trying to
push Chairman Bernard Arnault out of power. Moreover, Moet
Vuitton controls Dior and Givenchy perfumes, making it one of
L'Oreal's leading competitors.
   Mr. Owen-Jones says that if Moet Vuitton ever were broken
up, he doesn't think antitrust laws would forbid L'Oreal from
bidding for its competitor's perfume business. But he insists
that his alliance with the Vuittons isn't aimed at attacking
Moet Vuitton.
   "We have made it extremely clear that we have absolutely
no interest in Moet Vuitton and no hostile intention," he
says, adding that L'Oreal doesn't own any Moet Vuitton
shares.
   The Vuitton alliance, says Mr. Owen-Jones, is intended to
give L'Oreal a peek into a part of the luxury market where it
hasn't much experience. Beginning as a supplier of hair dyes
to beauty salons in 1907, L'Oreal moved gradually into mass
market goods and then luxury beauty products. Up to now, its
luxury business has focused on scents and creams.
   "We have extensive experience in marketing," Mr.
Owen-Jones explains, "but we lack experience in managing
luxury boutiques and we lack experience in leather. It
happened that the Vuitton family had just the complementary
experience."
   L'Oreal may decide to extend its involvement in this end
of the luxury business, although it also may take as long as
five years to decide, based on an evaluation of the Lanvin
experience, Mr. Owen-Jones says.
   Of more immediate concern, he says, are Japan, the U.S.
and East Europe.
   L'Oreal, he says, is treating East Germany "very much as
an extension of West Germany. We are making it the clear
responsibility of our West German subsidiary. At the current
speed, it is reasonable to expect that East Germany won't
have to be treated as a separate country at all."
   The rest of East Europe, however, offers less-bright
prospects, he says. He sees the possibility of a Hungarian
joint venture, but not until Hungarian law is clarified, and
he says the Soviet Union "in all probability will remain a
centralized country for some time."
   Mr. Owen-Jones says there has been a luxury market in East
Europe for some time, appealing to local elites and often
financed through complex payment systems through third
countries. The problem, he says, is to create a mass market,
which probably means local production and will take time.
   "It is important to be objective, and not claim that East
Europe will be a big boom in sales and profits," he says.
   The goal in the U.S. and Japan, he says, is to make
L'Oreal's brands truly international, by winning substantial
market share outside Europe.
   However, the biggest question hanging over L'Oreal is its
long-term ownership. It currently is majority controlled by
the holding company Gesparal S.A., which in turn is 51%
controlled by the family of Liliane Bettencourt, the only
daughter of L'Oreal's founder. Thought to be in her late 60s,
with one daughter, Mrs. Bettencourt often is described as the
richest woman in France.
   The other 49% of Gesparal is controlled by Nestle S.A.,
the huge Swiss food group. Will Nestle some day take control
of L'Oreal?
   "It is an obvious question mark," says Mr. Owen-Jones.
Nestle for now is "a stabilizing factor," helping prevent a
takeover. He says he can't comment on whether it some day
will be more. "It is a matter for speculation," he says.

   SEOUL -- South Korea's 10 largest business groups pledged
Thursday to cooperate with a strict government order
requiring them to sell excessive real estate holdings within
six months.
   The businesses, which include Hyundai, Lucky-Goldstar,
Daewoo, Lotte, Ssangyong and Sunkyong, also agreed to donate
1% of pretax business profits to create an employee welfare
fund and to use their resources to build apartments for their
workers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lee Kun-hee, chairman of the Samsung Group, made the
announcement on behalf of the 10 business groups at a news
conference. The heads of the other groups also attended.
   He said the proposed sales would involve 5,140 hectares
scattered throughout the country, roughly 15% of their total
real estate holdings. Under the agreement, all land not sold
by the six-month deadline will be transferred to a
state-owned development agency at prices set by the
government.
   Among the 10 groups, Samsung stands to sell the most
holdings, roughly 18.9 million square meters, followed by
Sunkyong's 10.3 million, Lucky-Goldstar's 4.6 million,
Ssangyong's 3.6 million and Hyundai's 3.3 million.
   The group owners also pledged to do their best to overcome
what they termed the critical condition of South Korea's
economy.
   Thursday's announcement came two days after the government
ordered the nation's 49 leading business groups to sell by
year's end millions of dollars in real estate they are
holding for speculation or don't urgently need for their
business operations. The government said businesses that fail
to abide by the order will face stiff taxes and a cutoff in
fresh bank loans.

   Quotron to Launch

   NEW YORK -- Quotron Systems Inc. said it plans to launch a
global foreign-exchange dealing system, which would compete
directly with similar systems offered by Reuters Holdings PLC
and Telerate Inc.
   Quotron, a unit of Citicorp, said its F/X Trader system,
which will be available later this year, is faster and easier
to use than other systems. It can, for instance, manage up to
six simultaneous foreign-currency trades on one screen.
Systems owned by Reuters and Telerate, a unit of Dow Jones &amp;
Co., can handle four transactions simultaneously, the
companies said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Quotron noted it has planned for years to expand into
other financial-information services -- such as supplying
data on foreign currencies and fixed-income instruments.
   But it isn't certain whether the market is big enough for
all three to prosper, even in a growing business where
foreign-currency trading volume in 1989 averaged $640 billion
a day. Reuters said it already handles 40% of that volume
through the 11,600 terminals it has installed world-wide
since introducing its Reuters Monitor Dealing Service in
1981.
   "Someone will succeed as an alternative provider," said
Reuters spokesman Bob Crooke. "The question is: Who?"
   Added Kenneth A. Hines, head of the Quotron F/X Trader
project: "The conventional wisdom is there's definitely room
for two. I can't comment on whether there's room for three."
   The stakes are high. Reuters said it spent #59.7 million
(US$100.3 million) last year on research and development,
much of which was devoted to upgrading its foreign-currency
trading service. Dow Jones has said that developing
Telerate's system and bringing it to market a year ago
accounted for $51.1 million in losses in 1989.
   Mr. Hines said Quotron has invested "nowhere near that
figure" in its service.

   TORONTO -- CAE Industries Ltd. said lower earnings from
the company's U.S. operations and accounting changes resulted
in a 94% drop in net income for the year ended March 31.
   CAE, a dominant player in the military and commercial
simulation markets, reported net income of 2.7 million
Canadian dollars (US$2.3 million) or three cents (Cdn) a
share, in the 1990 fiscal year, down from C$42.8 million, or
55 cents (Cdn) a share, the previous year. Revenue rose 33%
to C$1.12 billion from C$838.8 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CAE attributed the decline to changes in accounting
practices, which increased the company's income taxes and the
amount of a write-down on two unprofitable contracts at its
U.S. operations, CAELink. Income taxes payable in fiscal 1990
rose to C$19.1 million from C$11.7 million in 1989. The
write-down, originally estimated at C$10.5 million, now
amounts to C$17.5 million.
   Interest expenses also rose by C$15 million to C$42.9
million.
   CAE said that without the accounting changes, the company
would have reported net of about 30 cents (Cdn) a share.
   CAE acquired Singer Co.'s Link Flight Simulation Division
in 1988 for $550 million. The company has embarked on a
restructuring program which CAE's senior vice president of
finance, John Caldwell, said will improve the unit's
profitability in a few years' time.
   David Race, the company's president and chief executive
officer, said he expects to see "modest growth" in revenue
and profitability in its fiscal 1991 year. He declined to
give a specific estimate.
   "Based on the . . . progress we expect to make this year,
I am optimistic that fiscal 1992 should show a return to
improved growth in revenue and earnings," Mr. Race said.

   DALLAS -- A former director of the defunct Metroplex
Federal Savings Association and his defense lawyer were
indicted on charges of obstructing a federal criminal
investigation into the thrift's lending activities.
   Bob R. Franks, a former director of Metroplex, already was
under indictment on charges that he illegally benefited from
a loan made by NorthPark Savings Association while he was a
director at that institution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Franks and his lawyer in the NorthPark case, Earl
Rutledge, of Hurst, Texas, were indicted yesterday by a
federal grand jury in Dallas on charges related to two loans
made by Metroplex Savings.
   The loans, totaling $500,000, were made to a company that
was purchasing an interest in the joint venture that owned
the Metroplex Savings building, according to the indictment.
Messrs. Franks and Rutledge, who were partners in the joint
venture, are charged with concealing Mr. Rutledge's receipt
of funds from the loan from other directors at Metroplex
Savings.
   The indictment also charges Mr. Franks and his lawyer with
filing affidavits that falsely stated that the Metroplex
directors were aware that Mr. Franks benefited from the loan.
The affidavits were filed with three separate legal motions
in federal court in Dallas, including a motion to have the
affidavits presented to the federal grand jury considering
the Metroplex case, according to the indictment.
   Neither Mr. Franks, 55 years old, nor Mr. Rutledge, 56,
could be reached for comment yesterday.
   Metroplex was declared insolvent in late 1988 with $65.3
million in assets. NorthPark was declared insolvent at the
same time with $124.1 million in assets. The two thrifts were
merged with 12 others in December 1988 to become Consolidated
Federal Bank FSB.

   It's the Fountain Fights, Round II.
   Amid major defections of fast-food chains from PepsiCo
Inc.'s fountain business, Pepsi is launching an advertising
assault on rival Coca-Cola Co.

   The new campaign aims to turn the tables on Coke's central
argument that fast-food chains shouldn't sell Pepsi from
their fountain spigots because that effectively supports a
competitor. Pepsi -- owner of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and
Kentucky Fried Chicken -- is also the nation's largest
restaurant operator. As one recent Coke ad puts it: "If a
PepsiCo restaurant is your competition, every time you serve
Pepsi, you're pouring money into your competitor's pocket."
   Pepsi's new ad, which is being run in a major restaurant
trade magazine, suggests that Coke itself is hardly without
vested interests in restaurants. Calling Coke "Mc"Coke, the
ad points out that McDonald's is Coke's biggest customer.
Addressing restaurant operators, the ad says, "Your biggest
competitor . . . is McDonald's," and Coke is McDonald's "No.
1 ally in the effort to win customers from you."
   Of Coke, the Pepsi ad says, "We doubt they'll help you
succeed at McDonald's expense." The final zinger: "To Coke,
if you're not McDonald's, your business may mean McNothing."
   Responds Coke: "Pepsi is trying to do anything it can to
overcome the harsh reality that no business has ever been
successful for long by competing with its own customers."
   The ad campaign follows Coke's virtual gutting of Pepsi's
major fountain customers. In the past two weeks, Coke has
swiped Pepsi's biggest fountain client, Grand Metropolitan
PLC's Burger King Corp. unit, and has won major accounts from
TW Services Inc., a food-service company that is the largest
franchisee of Hardee's Food Systems Inc., a unit of Imasco
Ltd. Earlier this year, Wendy's International Inc. announced
it would put Coke instead of Pepsi in its company-owned
restaurants starting in 1991.
   "Pepsi's fountain thrust has been blunted," says Emanuel
Goldman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst.
   The fountain war is generally more important for volume
and visibility than for profitability. On major accounts, the
two rivals compete so fiercely for contracts that their
profit margins are typically less generous than usual,
beverage analysts say. But when a customer scans the order
boards at a McDonald's, or the No. 1 fast-food chain runs
joint advertising promotions with Coke, the soft-drink
company gains invaluable exposure.
   The loss of visibility will hurt Pepsi's efforts to narrow
Coke's fountain lead. Starting out in the soda-fountain
business more than a century ago, Coca-Cola has enjoyed
strong dominance in that area ever since. Coke currently
controls about 60% of the fountain business -- more than
double Pepsi's share. But during the 1980s, Pepsi had started
to make significant inroads into the fountain market,
particularly by winning the Burger King contract.
   As those gains now unravel, some beverage analysts are
skeptical about the appeal of Pepsi's new campaign. "I think
the fountain business is important to Coke, and they will do
whatever they can to win new accounts," says Michael Bellas,
president of Beverage Marketing Corp. "I think they'll be
competitive right down the line {on smaller restaurants} with
Pepsi."
   But clearly McDonald's is also important to Coke. It
accounts for about 5% of all Coke's U.S. soft-drink volume,
and about 15% of its fountain business, according to
PaineWebber. And when McDonald's opened its first restaurant
in the Soviet Union, Donald R. Keough, Coca-Cola's president,
flew to Moscow to be on hand for the festivities.
