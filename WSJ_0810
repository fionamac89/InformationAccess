   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- IG Laboratories said it licensed
exclusively an experimental technology that promises to
enable fetal testing through a simple blood test rather than
amniocentesis, a procedure that poses a risk of miscarriage.
   The technology covered by the agreement was developed at
Boston's Children's Medical Center by Diana Bianchi and other
researchers, the company said. The technology involves
isolating fetal red blood cells from maternal blood. Last
year, Dr. Bianchi and colleagues reported that they had been
able to determine a fetus's sex by isolating such cells and
examining DNA contained in them.

   The technology, which will be jointly developed by IG
Laboratories and Dr. Bianchi's laboratory, promises to
broaden fetal screening for genetic defects, the company
said. A spokesman for IG Laboratories said that genetic
testing based on the technology might be commercially
available within three years. However, the technique is in
the early stages of development and hasn't been proved
practical for widespread screening. Moreover, use of the
potential test is likely to be controversial, given that it
might increase the number of abortions.
   Amniocentesis, which is now often used for genetic
screening of fetuses, involves withdrawing fluid from the
womb with a long needle -- a process that carries a small but
significant risk of inducing a miscarriage. The risk is
generally considered too high except for pregnant women --
mainly those over 35 -- who are at elevated risk for bearing
children with genetic diseases. However, more than 80% of
infants with Down's syndrome, a common genetic disorder that
causes mental retardation, are borne by women under 35, the
company noted. With the new technology, such cases might be
detected early without posing a risk of miscarriage.
   IG Laboratories is a 56%-owned unit of Genzyme Corp., a
Boston-based maker of biomedical products that publicly sold
a stake in the unit earlier this year.

   Never Mind, Dan, You Can Order
   A Nice Broccoli Mold for George

   Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln had their
faces etched in stone. Dan Quayle will soon have his puss on
a pumpkin.
   Assuming, of course, that Richard Tweddell's garden grows.
Mr. Tweddell's Cincinnati company, Vegiforms Inc., makes
plastic vanity molds that shape blossoming vegetables into
various shapes, even a vice president's head.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Dan's coming along beautifully," says Mr. Tweddell,
noting that the VP pumpkin should be ready for Halloween.
"I'm so proud." Mr. Tweddell has already grown vegetables
resembling Elvis, Clark Gable and Pat Sajak. "We do a
beautiful Ron Reagan," he adds.
   This guy may sound like a fruitcake, but he gets $2,500
for each vanity mold sold. For the more budget-conscious,
there's a line of $10.95 molds that create hearts, diamonds,
elves and a set of happy and sad faces for squash or
cucumbers.
   Mr. Tweddell, a toy designer, says his favorite is the
mold that can disguise yellow squash as an ear of corn. "It's
great fun at a barbecue," he notes.
   He prefers using eggplants for women's faces because "the
skin is so beautiful." His replicas of actresses Linda Evans
and Vivian Leigh "had a sheen to them, like a hood ornament."
That is until they start to rot. Then, he says, "they get
crow's-feet and their mouths pucker."
   Culinary experts scoff at the idea of adding corny
vegetables to the menu. La Maisonette, where well-heeled
Cincinnatians dine, isn't likely to try them. "We're not that
adventurous here," sniffs George Haidon, veteran chef. He
prefers working with fresh fish, which, he says, "aren't
cooperative enough" to become artwork.
   Some goofy gourds end up as common side dishes. Mr.
Tweddell carefully harvested a horde of David Letterman
eggplants and squash, but producers of the late-night TV talk
show voted against putting them on the program. "They said
they weren't grotesque enough," he says.
   But a Greek restaurant didn't mind. It bought several
pounds of the Letterman veggies and chopped them up for
moussaka, which it describes as a "very greasy" casserole.
   Meanwhile, Liz Murphy, a spokeswoman for Mr. Quayle,
figures it's all right for the vice president to be a
vegetable, as long as others in the cornucopia are credible
and, preferably, Republican. "He wouldn't mind being a
pumpkin head if he's in good company," she says.

   Lackluster Sales

   Clearance sales of summer apparel and seasonal goods gave
many of the nation's big retailers lackluster results last
month as consumer demand continued to soften.
   July sales, which analysts said were in line with their
expectations, gained about 2% to 8% over a year earlier. The
Merrill Lynch Retail Sales Index of 17 big retail chains
reported that July sales gains were about 5.7%, down slightly
from a 5.8% gain in June, while Alex. Brown &amp; Sons' weighted
index of 14 major retail chains showed July sales gains
averaging 4.3%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Because July results are heavily concentrated on clearance
activity, analysts note that the month can't be considered a
harbinger of overall sales trends. But last month's sales
continued a pattern of sluggish consumer demand, which,
coupled with rising gasoline prices, has prompted retail
analysts to lower their earnings estimates for the second
half of the year.
   "July is a continuation of the underlying tone of the
sales reflecting last month's decline in employment," said
Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
"This raises the probability of a recession developing in the
second half of this year as consumers anticipate higher
inflation and oil prices." Mr. Edelman lowered his earnings
estimates for the retailers he follows by an average of 3% to
4% for the rest of 1990.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., also
lowered his estimates. He expects retailers to post earnings
gains of between 7% and 8% for the second half of the year
instead of 8% to 10%.
   In July, San Francisco-based Gap Inc. vaulted ahead of the
pack with a 28% sales gain at stores open for more than a
year. "Gap has the right fashion at the right times and had
an extraordinarily good month," Mr. Edelman said. Gap shares
closed in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at
$55.75, up $2.
   At Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's
largest retailer, same-store sales rose 3.1% with strongest
sales in appliances and home-entertainment and automotive
products. This week, Sears announced that its chairman,
Edward Brennan, has reassumed the top management spot at
Sears's merchandising division, reflecting the mass
merchant's growing frustration over its failure to turn
around its $31 billion-a-year retailing business. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, Sears shares closed at
$30.50, up 87.5 cents.
   At K mart Corp., Troy, Mich., the nation's second-largest
retailer had a samestore sales gain of 2.2%. K mart Chairman
Joseph E. Antonini said he was "pleased with the July results
considering the relatively weak retail environment." Apparel
sales, including new fall merchandise, were particularly
strong, he said.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Bentonville, Ark., reported
same-store sales rose 8% from a year earlier.
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp., which included for the
first time the sales of its recently acquired Chicago-based
Marshall Field's department store chain, posted a same-store
sales increase of 4.4%.
   J.C. Penney Co., based in Dallas, said same-store sales
climbed 2% in July; at Columbus, Ohio-based Limited Inc.
samestore sales gained 6%; at May Department Stores Co. in
St. Louis, same-store sales rose 4.4%; while New York-based
Mercantile Stores posted a 0.4% same-store sales rise.
   "July marks the beginning of what will be a protracted
period of weakness lasting at least through the end of the
year, and I've turned bearish on the outlook," said Robert
Buchanan, a retail analyst at Alex. Brown. For the second
half of the year, he joined other analysts in lowering his
earnings estimates an average of 6% for each of the 11
companies he follows.

   Bond Corp. Holders
   Approve One Part
   Of Restructuring

   LONDON -- Investors in Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. approved
one aspect of the ailing company's proposed restructuring,
but once again postponed decisions on three others.
   The partial approval leaves the future of Australian
entrepreneur Alan Bond in doubt. Mr. Bond last month said he
would quit as chairman of his flagship company in exchange
for investors' support for actions crucial to Bond Corp.'s
survival. The resignation was to come within 30 days of the
investors' approval.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't clear yesterday whether that 30-day clock had
started ticking. Mr. Bond was sailing in Australia and
unavailable for comment, according to Peter Lucas, Bond
Corp.'s director of public relations.
   "I can't speak for Alan Bond," Mr. Lucas said at a news
conference. But Mr. Lucas added that "clearly there is a
desire" among investors to see Mr. Bond step down. And if Mr.
Bond needs to resign to obtain approval of the company
restructuring, "that is what he'll do," Mr. Lucas said.
   The bondholders have been asked to clear the proposed sale
of Bond Corp.'s breweries to its 58%-controlled Bell
Resources Ltd. unit, and to decide whether to waive about $25
million Australian (US$19.8 million) in interest due on
securities over the next year. Decisions on the matters had
already been postponed twice.
   Yesterday, holders of sterling-denominated convertible
bonds approved the breweries sale. But among holders of U.S.
dollar-denominated bonds at yesterday's meeting, approval for
the breweries sale fell short of the required 75% majority.
To avoid defeat, bondholders voted to adjourn the meeting
without a vote on the matter, and to resubmit it at a new
meeting tentatively scheduled for Sept. 10.
   Support for the interest moratorium fell short of the
required 75% majority among both sterling and U.S.-dollar
denominated bondholders. Both groups postponed decisions on
that matter until Nov. 30.
   The investors also intended yesterday to elect a
bondholders' committee to advise the company. But that effort
was postponed until Sept. 4 because yesterday's meeting
lacked the necessary quorum. Meanwhile, Mr. Lucas said,
investors attending the meeting formed "unofficial
committees" which will try to settle certain procedural
issues before formal discussions begin with Bond Corp.
directors.
   Mr. Lucas blamed summer vacations for thwarting Bond
Corp.'s effort to round up holders of its bearer bonds. But
"there is a very clear indication that the majority of
bondholders want the brewery transaction to proceed," he
said.

   HONG KONG -- Playmates International Holdings Ltd.
announced a 69-fold surge in first-half profit, as the
luminous performance of its "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"
line drove earnings far above even the most sanguine
expectations.
   The Hong Kong toy group said final profit skyrocketed to
350 million Hong Kong dollars (US$45 million) in the first
half from HK$5 million a year earlier. Earnings per share
soared to HK$2 (25 U.S. cents) from 3 Hong Kong cents, while
turnover climbed to HK$1.38 billion from HK$254 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "No one thought their results could look like this," said
an analyst of industrial issues at an international brokerage
firm. The results were about 50% higher than most full-year
profit expectations of HK$200 million to HK$250 million.
   The group's directors proposed an interim dividend of 10
Hong Kong cents a share; no payout was made in the 1989 first
half. They also recommended a 3-for-1 bonus issue to help
improve the shares' liquidity.

   TORONTO -- A dissident shareholder of Agnico-Eagle Mines
Ltd., who had planned to seek a buyer for the company, said
he has sold his remaining 2% interest in the gold-mining
concern.
   Montreal businessman Jacques Forget said he sold his
Agnico shares because he doesn't expect the company will
reach its targeted level of production this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Agnico spokesman Sean Boyd said the company expects to
produce in 1990 between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces more than the
160,000 ounces the company had targeted. Last year, Agnico's
production amounted to 157,000 ounces.
   Mr. Forget couldn't be reached for further comment. In a
statement, he didn't disclose the terms of the sale of the
Agnico shares nor did he identify the buyer.
   As previously reported, Mr. Forget said earlier that he
intended to seek a change of control at Agnico because of
what he called "numerous errors in management." He gave no
indication in his statement of whether he still plans to
pursue a change in management and control.
   On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Agnico shares closed
yesterday at 8.13 Canadian dollars (US$7.09), up 25 Canadian
cents. At last report, Agnico had 27.4 million shares
outstanding.

   One Year After Signing of Bailout Bill
   S&amp;L Industry Remains Mired in Crisis

   WASHINGTON -- The landmark savings-and-loan cleanup bill
was signed into law one year ago this week, but don't expect
any celebrations with cake and confetti.
   A year after President Bush proclaimed the S&amp;L debacle to
be on the road to solution, the administration and Congress
are mired more deeply than ever in what has become the
nation's biggest financial crisis since the Depression.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, the S&amp;L anniversary serves as a reminder that the
underlying causes of the mess -- government by delay and
diffused responsibility -- haven't changed a bit one year
later. "There has been an absolute breakdown in political
accountability," says Thomas "Lud" Ashley, a former
Democratic congressman from Ohio and a close friend of Mr.
Bush.
   Adds Scott Hodge, a budget analyst for the conservative
Heritage Foundation: "I don't blame voters for not knowing
where to turn. To throw this bum out might just mean you get
another bum."
   The administration defends both the bailout law and its
own record in handling the crisis. The anniversary "is not an
occasion for celebration, nor is it an occasion for despair,"
says John Robson, undersecretary of the Treasury. First and
foremost, officials say, they have succeeded in keeping the
federal government's time-honored promise to protect
depositors.
   But administration officials also acknowledge that the
efforts of the past year have resulted in a host of
consequences they never intended. Faced with initial
complaints that few sick S&amp;Ls were being sold, the new
bailout agency created by the law went into high gear in this
year's April-June quarter and blew a hole in the federal
budget, prompting President Bush's admission that a tax
increase is possible. Some economists blame the real-estate
slump on S&amp;L overbuilding, and see the current credit crunch
as a reaction to freewheeling S&amp;L lending.
   Further, the news from the thrift front will take an
especially ugly turn if the U.S. moves into a recession,
causing more S&amp;Ls to fail and driving bailout costs even
higher. Banks, saddled with huge debts to the Third World and
their own extensive real-estate lending, could suffer big
losses, too.
   To be sure, if energy prices soar due to a sudden shortage
of Mideast oil supplies, the Texas economy might rebound. But
prices would have to be high and sustained before improved
prices in Texas real estate would take some of the sting out
of the bailout costs.
   Right now, at least, the main response to the looming S&amp;L
crisis is an orgy of political recrimination that shows no
signs of abating. Next month, House Banking Committee
Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) plans high-profile
hearings that will haul former Reagan administration
officials such as ex-Treasury Secretary Donald Regan before
the committee to account for their actions, or inactions.
Also capturing public attention next month will be hearings
on the role of Neil Bush, the president's son, in the $1
billion failure of Colorado's Silverado Savings &amp; Loan.
   Support is also building in Congress and elsewhere for a
presidential commission to investigate the causes of the S&amp;L
crisis -- which will almost certainly provide more grist for
the blame game.
   Congress has also made a major show of going after
so-called "S&amp;L kingpins," most recently with its swiftly
passed thrift-fraud bill. But even some proponents of the law
acknowledge it will likely have little practical impact,
since it isn't retroactive and many of the offenses were
committed years ago. Moreover, despite voter fury at S&amp;L
executives, most observers believe bad business decisions by
an undersupervised industry were far more to blame than
out-and-out fraud. "The incidence of fraud is clearly being
exaggerated," says Stanford University economist Daniel
Brumbaugh. "It's all window dressing."
   Officials involved in the bailout say the swirling
politics surrounding the effort are complicating their job
just as they move into what may be the most sensitive phase:
the attempt to sell off the billions of dollars of
real-estate assets that have been salvaged from the dead
institutions.
   Already, a bevy of congressional committees have hauled
current and former regulators to Capitol Hill to grill them
on sales of institutions, salaries paid, and why they are
moving slowly and costing money, or quickly and imprudently.
The accusatory atmosphere has regulators looking nervously
over their shoulders before they commit to a sale and,
officials say, may also drive away some potential buyers.
   "They haul these guys up and hang them in the middle of
the village square," says Treasury's Mr. Robson. "There are
people who will say, `I don't need that.'"
   Yet many in Congress say the administration must accept
part of the blame for the supercharged atmosphere through
their own behavior. "They set themselves up for accusations
that sound political," says Sen. Bob Kerrey (D., Neb.) "We
have almost no accountability for the expenditures they are
making. They control all the information in this."
   Meanwhile, neither Congress nor the administration has yet
managed to do much about the major pending issues that both
admit have to be addressed. One big problem is the cleanup
law itself. There so far has been little political appetite
for reopening and rewriting the controversial measure, even
though some of its contradictory provisions have regulators
throwing up their hands in frustration.
   Among other things, the regulators are having a hard time
reconciling the bill's requirements that they sell seized
property as quickly as possible, and that they not affect
real-estate markets. The law also was intended to make
thrifts invest more prudently, yet it forces them to put
their money almost entirely into one area, home mortgages.
   Already, several federal courts have challenged parts of
the bailout law, and some observers say major parts of it
could be in serious legal jeopardy unless Congress and the
administration fix it. "There was a lot of mindless vengeance
in the law," warns Dallas thrift attorney Richard Kneipper.
"We're going to see a lot more of these suits."
   Both Congress and the administration have been reluctant
to press the politically sensitive issue of federal deposit
insurance, despite the fact that many officials admit that
the increase in deposit insurance to $100,000 was a major
contributing factor in the debacle. Any serious discussion of
the issue has been shoved back at least until the Treasury
Department completes a study on the subject at the end of the
year -- safely after the November elections.
   Another major contributing factor also remains
unaddressed: the campaign-finance laws. The Senate passed a
spending-limit bill last week before it recessed, but
President Bush believes it is skewed toward favoring
Democrats, and it is certain veto bait. Meanwhile, candidates
of both parties are engaged in a game of
return-the-thrift-industry-contributions, trumpeting their
virtue after accepting, in some cases, tens of thousands of
dollars from thrifts for years.
   "It doesn't make any difference if you've blown the
country to hell financially," says former Rep. Ashley. "You
still get elected."

   43% Decline in Earnings;
   BP Says Profit Fell 94%

   Royal Dutch/Shell Group and British Petroleum Co. reported
plunging profits for the second quarter, but the recent surge
in oil prices is expected to help the companies rebound in
the rest of the year.
   Both companies were cautious in predicting what Iraq's
aggression in the Persian Gulf would mean for oil prices. At
a news conference, BP's chairman, Robert Horton, said he
expected oil prices to remain "on the north side" of $20 to
$22 a barrel over the next six months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   North Sea oil prices were quoted yesterday at around $25 a
barrel, up from an average of $16 in the second quarter.
   BP said it didn't expect the Persian Gulf situation to
create an immediate oil-supply crisis. The company estimated
that increased output by other countries would make up for
half the four million barrels a day lost from Iraq and
Kuwait.
   Shell said the outlook for its results this year "is
obviously extremely uncertain and almost entirely dependent
on how events in the Middle East unfold."
   Royal Dutch/Shell's net income fell 43% to $940 million
from $1.64 billion a year earlier. On a current-cost basis,
which strips out inventory gains or losses and is similar to
the accounting system used by U.S. oil companies, net fell
16% to $1.24 billion from $1.49 billion.
   Sales grew 6% to $27.86 billion from $26.17 billion.
   In the first half, net fell 41% to $2.3 billion from $3.88
billion a year earlier. On a current-cost basis, net fell 23%
to $2.62 billion from $3.42 billion. Sales climbed 11% to
$56.99 billion from $51.2 billion.
   BP's net plummeted 94% to $74 million from $1.22 billion.
The quarter included an extraordinary loss of $18 million,
compared with a gain of $451 million a year earlier.
Current-cost net slid to $478 million from $604 million.
Sales rose to $12.2 billion from $12.01 billion.
   In the first half, BP's net fell to $706 million from
$2.29 billion. That included extraordinary gains of $43
million in the latest half and $451 million a year before.
Current-cost profit declined to $1.08 billion from $1.27
billion. Sales grew to $25.54 billion from $23.45 billion.
   Both companies were hurt by lower oil prices and reduced
profit margins on petrochemicals. Shell's results were
roughly in line with expectations, but BP's figures were well
below forecasts.
   Stockbrokers said the market paid little attention to the
figures, focusing instead on action in the Persian Gulf and
its effect on oil prices. "That's really rendered everything
else superfluous," said John Toalster, an analyst at Hoare
Govett in London.
   In the second quarter, Shell's production of crude oil
grew 11% to 1.9 million barrels a day, but that was offset by
the drop in prices. The average price of North Sea Brent
crude was down 15% from a year earlier to $16.05 a barrel.
   Operating profit from chemicals slumped to $257 million
from $435 million, reflecting a general drop in prices after
a boom in the late 1980s. Shell said that the "downward trend
in margins appears to have stabilized" but that the company
remains cautious on the outlook for chemicals.
   BP's operating profit from chemicals dropped to $65
million from $305 million a year before. The company said the
yearearlier results were exceptionally good and that plant
maintenance hurt performance in the latest quarter.

   LOS ANGELES -- Bell Industries Inc. said net income jumped
96% in the fourth quarter ended June 30 on the strength of
higher-margin sales and reduced overhead.
   The industrial products company's net totaled $2.9
million, or 49 cents a share, up from $1.5 million, or 25
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales slipped 2.6% to $102.9
million from $105.7 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Theodore Williams, chairman and president, said the Los
Angeles-based company is "confident that the pattern of
earnings improvement will extend into the new fiscal year."
   Bell said operating profit rose sharply in its two largest
business groups, electronics products and business products,
despite lower sales.
   However, operating profit declined in Bell's remaining
businesses, graphic arts and motor vehicle parts and
accessories, reflecting costs of restructuring the operations
and a change of facilities.
   For the fiscal year, net rose 80% to $8.2 million, or
$1.40 a share, from $4.6 million, or 75 cents a share, in
fiscal 1989. Sales fell 5.4% to $395.8 million from $418.2
million.

   CHICAGO -- Ameritech's Michigan Bell Co. unit proposed a
new pricing structure in reaction to increased competition
for interstate long-distance service, but said the move
wouldn't boost revenue.
   In a filing with the Michigan Public Service Commission,
the company said it would cut interstate long-distance rates
15% and would discount calls between cities and suburbs. The
cuts, amounting to about $140 million, would be offset by
raising pay-phone charges to 25 cents from 20 cents and by
increasing charges for operator-assisted calls and
information services.

   British Telecom
   Shows 17% Rise
   In Pretax Profit
   ---
   Revenue Increases Slowly,
   But Cost Control Helps
   To Boost the Earnings

   LONDON -- A cost-cutting campaign at British
Telecommunications PLC began to pay off in the fiscal first
quarter, as the main phone company reported a brisk 17% rise
in pretax profit.
   The pretax increase, to #741 million ($1.4 billion) from
#635 million a year earlier, came despite a sluggish British
economy and slower growth in telephone revenues. But the
company's labor and pension costs grew at a slower pace --
suggesting to analysts that the bureaucratic phone giant is
at last managing to control its costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The company's actually doing well at holding down costs,"
said London-based analyst Richard Ryder of Salomon Brothers
Inc. He and other London analysts interpreted the
first-quarter numbers as a sign that the company's profit
this year may suffer only minimally from the rocky British
economic conditions. Reflecting that sentiment, British
Telecom's stock price rose five pence a share to 292 pence
late Thursday on London's stock exchange.
   Since its 1984 privatization, the former state phone
monopoly has been criticized for having too many workers, too
much bureaucracy and inadequate service. Earlier this year,
though, tough-minded Chairman Iain Vallance announced a
sweeping reorganization -- eliminating management layers,
reshaping divisions, and planning annual job cuts of about
10,000 employees, or 4% of the current total, for at least
two years.
   The plan, though criticized by unions as too severe, was
welcomed in London's financial circles as needed preparation
for the 1990s. This winter, the British government is
expected to reduce regulation and allow more competition in
the phone market. With its current high costs, British
Telecom would be vulnerable to any new, leaner competitors.
Chief among these, analysts say, will be the U.S. regional
phone companies. In recent months, they have been investing
in British cable-television networks, in hopes of using them
to provide phone service in competition with British Telecom.
   Judging by the first-quarter results released yesterday,
the reorganization is beginning to work. Net profit for the
quarter ended June 30 rose 19%, to #493 million, or eight
pence a share, from #413 million, or 6.8 pence a share, a
year earlier. By contrast, because of the sluggish U.K.
economy, revenue rose only 9.6% to #3.21 billion from #2.93
billion. The company's operating profit margin widened to 27%
from 25% a year earlier.
   In a telephone interview, Financial Director Barry Romeril
said the company's staff costs rose just 2.6% in the quarter.
Much of that slow growth stemmed from a #50 million drop in
British Telecom's contributions to its employee pension fund;
last year, the company began trimming its contributions on
the basis of revised actuarial estimates. In addition, Mr.
Romeril said, the 2,300-person drop in the U.K. work force
during the quarter helped to hold down costs. After adjusting
for the pension savings and other factors, he said, the
company's underlying staff costs rose by 6% to 6.5% -- well
below Britain's near-10% inflation rate.
   Mr. Romeril said "the management is certainly going to
carry on" with its cost-cutting program in succeeding months.
He added, however, that "we can't determine what will happen
in terms of growth" in revenue this year; he said the outlook
is clouded by the uncertain British economy. "This is a soft
economy, and we can't be immune" to it, he said.
Historically, growth in telephone company revenues slows
during economic downturns, as businesses cut back on
telephone calling.
   For the 12 months ended June 30, the company said its
domestic call volume rose by 9%, slower than the 10% growth
in the 12 months ended March 31. Similarly, international
call volume grew by 12%, compared with 13% in the earlier
period.

   Storm Is Brewing Between Employers,
   Employees Over the Right to Privacy

   NEW YORK -- Conflict between employers' need for
information and employees' privacy rights is growing and is
the subject of increasing judicial and legislative scrutiny,
a Conference Board survey found.
   Surveying nearly 400 companies in the U.S., Canada and
Europe, the Conference Board found that more than 80% of the
respondents said that requesting more information from
prospective workers helps avoid the need for more-intrusive
measures, such as electronic surveillance, to ensure
workplace security.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But information-gathering options are being reviewed
carefully by the courts and elected representatives.
Polygraphs used to be "one way to get information. They are
no longer allowed in all but a few situations," says Ronald
E. Berenbeim, author of the study at the nonprofit research
group. Also, "a certain amount of opposition and concern"
about psychological testing is developing, the analyst says.
   Among potentially sensitive subjects, a substantial
proportion of companies said they needed more information
than they did five years ago about employee health, but not
about age and marital status, criminal record, personal
financial status, or outside activities.
   Two-thirds of the U.S. participants said a lack of health
data had impeded their efforts to control health-care costs.
More than a third of U.S. companies did say they needed more
data about criminal records, but such need isn't shared by
the Canadian and European participants, the survey says.
   Nearly half the participants limit an immediate
supervisor's access to data about subordinates; almost all
the companies restrict managers from reviewing information
about employees who don't work for them, the report says.
   And three-quarters of the respondents said they wouldn't
divulge any data other than salary to prospective employers.
   The report showed a sharp divergence of opinion regarding
psychological tests, with 70% of non-U.S. companies calling
them useful and just 47% of the U.S. companies agreeing.
Those U.S. companies that disagreed called such tests
inappropriate for their work forces and said they could cause
litigation.
   More than two-thirds of the participants said searches and
surveillance are ineffective, hurting morale, going against
company philosophy, and -- again -- potentially dragging a
company into a lawsuit.
   Nonetheless, "such practices are fairly widespread,
particularly" in the U.S., the survey says. Some 15% of the
companies monitor use of phones and computers to determine
whether they are being used for nonbusiness purposes. And a
majority of participants in all three regions will search a
worker's locker, desk or office.
   As for off-duty conduct, "Company intrusions or
restrictions on intimate employee behavior are rare," the
report says. And when an employee doesn't disclose his
relationship to his or her company, bans on outside political
activity also are "infrequent," the survey found.
   The survey recommends certain policies and practices
regarding employee privacy. These include establishing
written criteria for the personnel data the company collects;
giving employees the right to see their files and to
challenge inaccuracies; and limiting the access that
employees' immediate managers and other supervisors have to
those files.
   Among other things, the report also suggests that
companies should give workers' copies of written requests for
information and, except where law enforcers demand
information via subpoena or other methods, should release the
data only if the worker consents.

   TOKYO -- Honda Motor Co. established a wholly owned
automobile importing and sales subsidiary in Verona, Italy,
scheduled to begin operations in October.
   To be called Honda Automobili Italia S.p.A., the unit was
capitalized at 43 billion lire ($36.9 million). The new
subsidiary will handle and reinforce automobile operations
previously managed by Honda Italia Industriale S.p.A., which
also manages motorcycle manufacturing and sales, as well as
power-product importing and sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Honda said that Italy's automobile market, with 2.362
million passenger vehicles sold in 1989, is the
second-largest in Europe next to West Germany. Not including
off-road, four-wheel drive vehicles, Japanese passenger
vehicles account for 8,579 units of this total, Honda said.
   Italy's market has grown at a 45% pace over the past five
years, the Japanese auto maker said.
   Honda Automobili Italia is expected to sell 4,500 units in
1990, including projected sales of 2,900 units through
September by the former sales office, the parent company
said. Sales are seen at 7,500 units in 1991.
   There is an import restriction for Japanese vehicles in
Italy, so Honda has been selling its automobiles through
licensed import. Italian sales of its Concerto model began in
April. The Concerto is produced by U.K. auto maker Rover
Group, a unit of British Aerospace PLC.

   DETROIT -- Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and a strike by
workers in Flint, Mich., are forcing General Motors Corp. to
halt production at two of its U.S. assembly plants.
   GM said it will have to idle its car plant in Ypsilanti,
Mich., and lay off 4,200 workers for two weeks beginning Aug.
13 because the Gulf conflict has derailed an order for
Chevrolet Caprices and Buick Estate Wagons.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait is one of the best overseas markets for North
American-made GM cars. Kuwaitis particularly liked big,
full-sized GM sedans such as the Caprice. The auto maker had
two dealerships in Kuwait that sold about 10,000 GM vehicles
in 1989, most of them built in North America. GM sold a total
of about 40,000 vehicles in the entire Mideast region last
year.
   Earlier this week, GM said it was suspending work on
contracts with Iraq's State Enterprise for Automotive
Industry under which the auto maker was to have helped the
Iraqis build a plant that would assemble North American
designed GM cars and trucks.
   Separately, GM began to feel the effects of a strike at a
key parts-making facility in Flint. The auto maker yesterday
idled its truck plant in Moraine, Ohio, that builds sport
utility vehicles, putting 2,500 workers on lay-off.
   GM may have to idle as many as two more plants today
because they've run out of parts supplied by the Flint
operation, a company spokesman said. He declined to identify
which plants could be affected. GM has said as many as eight
of its North American assembly factories could be idled
within the next few days if the Flint walkout isn't resolved.
   Negotiations to settle the strike continued yesterday, but
without any apparent movement. "There hasn't been anything
serious to discuss," a top UAW official said yesterday. Talks
are scheduled to continue today.

   Kohl, Facing Political Firestorm, Scraps
   Plan to Advance Date of Unification Vote

   BONN -- Facing insurmountable political opposition, West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl scrapped plans to make Oct. 14
the date for formal unification and all-German elections.
   The West German leader set off a political firestorm last
week when he backed a call from his East German counterpart,
Lothar de Maiziere, to accelerate the already hectic schedule
for the full political unity of the two countries. Parties in
the two Germanys already had agreed to hold the vote on Dec.
2, and Bonn now says it will stick with that date.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thursday's decision came in the wake of a stormy session
of the Bundestag, West Germany's parliament, in which the
opposition Social Democrats adamantly refused to approve a
change in West Germany's Basic Law needed to clear the way
for the earlier vote. Mr. Kohl needed a two-thirds majority,
and therefore the Social Democrats' support, to succeed.
   The dispute illustrates the way politics in the two
Germanys has become hopelessly intertwined. Sister parties in
East and West are working together to give themselves the
best possible chances in the forthcoming elections. For the
Social Democrats, this means putting off the election to
allow time for East Germany's deteriorating economy to stir a
political backlash against Mr. Kohl.
   For the same reason, Mr. Kohl and his allies are eager to
get the election over with quickly. The longer East Germany
remains separate, they argue, the longer the uncertainties
remain that have caused Western companies to hold back on
investing in the East's shattered economy.
   Otto Lambsdorff, head of the Free Democrats, the junior
partner in Mr. Kohl's ruling coalition, told lawmakers
yesterday that holding elections in October rather than
December would "improve the pyschological situation {in East
Germany} and thereby create better frameworks for the
economy."
   The dispute erupted as the costs of the German merger are
ballooning. Yesterday, a top official in Bonn's Finance
Ministry said the country was working on a new supplemental
budget to cover the spiraling costs of German unity. And on
Wednesday, Mr. Kohl urged the West German banking community
to pump more money into the East and shoulder more of the
risks.
   "The economic and social situation in East Germany has
worsened faster than we expected," said Matthias Wissmann, a
member of parliament who belongs to Mr. Kohl's Christian
Democrats. But he emphasized that the government had expected
a difficult transition.
   If the situation in East Germany continues to worsen, the
country could simply throw itself into the arms of West
Germany. Under West German Basic Law, East Germany could
proclaim itself part of West Germany -- and the West would
have to accept the decision.
   But again, cross-border politics are likely to decide how
this is played out. The Social Democrats in both Germanys
favor merging the two countries under the Basic Law soon,
possibly in September. This could give the Social Democrats a
powerful political edge, as it might make it even easier for
them to blame the Christian Democrats for the country's woes.
   Not surprisingly, the Christian Democrats argue that
formal merger and all-German elections are "two sides of the
same coin" that must take place simultaneously. Otherwise,
they argue, the East Germans could find themselves without a
democratically elected government.
   It isn't clear if Mr. Kohl would still insist on linking
the two. In the past, the Bonn government has said unity
couldn't occur before Sept. 12, when the two Germanys and the
four victorious powers from World War II -- the U.S., France,
Britain, and the Soviet Union -- meet in Moscow for the last
round of the so-called two-plus-four negotiations.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Kohl's decision to back down on the
election date could clear the way for a backlog of badly
needed legislation in both countries. During this week's
face-off over an election date, the East German parliament --
apparently by accident -- failed to muster the votes
necessary to pass the election treaty that sets the ground
rules for the coming vote. Both German parliaments are now
expected to pass the treaty later this month.
   The two countries are also still hammering away at a
second state treaty covering issues the two sides weren't
able to wrap up in time for the treaty on economic and
monetary union, which took effect July 1.

   Ameritech, Bell Atlantic Get Permission

   A federal judge gave Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp.
permission to provide international long-distance service
between the U.S. and New Zealand through Telecom Corp. of New
Zealand.
   New Zealand's government in June picked the two Baby Bells
to buy the state-owned phone company for about $2.46 billion,
and the transaction is expected to be completed next month.
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic immediately sought a waiver from
the consent decree that broke up the Bell System to permit
them, through Telecom, to handle the New Zealand portion of
telecommunications traffic between the two countries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among other things, the consent decree bars the Baby Bells
from the long-distance business. Judge Harold Greene, who
oversees the decree, granted the waiver request and gave the
Baby Bells permission to own minority stakes in international
satellite and undersea cables.
   Judge Greene, however, stipulated that the companies,
through Telecom, can't own more than 10% of undersea cables
or international satellite systems. He also said that Telecom
can't provide long-distance service in the U.S. or own
international facilities, such as satellite earth stations,
in the U.S.
   In addition, the judge barred the two U.S. phone companies
from marketing Telecom's international service in the U.S.,
adding that Telecom can't interconnect with Bell Atlantic's
or Ameritech's domestic networks.
   In granting the waiver, Judge Greene gave the regional
Bell companies more encouragement as they venture overseas.
The proposed purchase of the New Zealand phone company, he
said, "constitutes a one-time opportunity to export American
telecommunications expertise and technology." The
opportunity, he said, meshes with his policy of "encouraging
foreign business ventures by the regional companies where
this can be done consistently with the decree."
   At the same time, he emphasized that he wasn't considering
a blanket waiver that would permit the Baby Bells to acquire
10% of any business the consent decree bars them from
entering. He said the waiver shouldn't be read as an
indication that future requests to enter for overseas
businesses will be "blindly granted."
   Under the agreement, two New Zealand companies,
Freightways Holdings Ltd., a conglomerate, and Fay, Richwhite
Holdings Ltd., a merchant bank, initially will have a
combined stake of less than 1%. The interest will grow to 10%
over the next three years, while Bell Atlantic and Ameritech
will reduce their combined stake to 49.9% through a series of
stock offerings that could begin as early as next year.
   MCI Communications Corp. had objected to the waiver
request on grounds that the Bells could discriminate in their
selection of international carriers, particularly when MCI,
which is also involved in a New Zealand long-distance
venture, goes into competition with Telecom of New Zealand.
But while Judge Greene acknowledged that MCI may be correct,
he said "such local discrimination is of no legitimate
concern to the court unless it is likely to affect the U.S.
segment of those calls."
   An MCI spokesman said Judge Greene "took into account
satisfactorily the concerns that we had raised," citing the
judge's restrictions on ownership of international cables and
satellites and prohibition against discrimination against
U.S. international carriers.

   Guilty Genes: Hunting Hereditary Disease

   Although few people study classical Greek anymore, the
language continues to influence modern life in unexpected
ways. Traditional introductory texts used to try to sugarcoat
the student's task of memorizing the Greek verb down to and
including the middle aorist tense by dangling in front of him
English cognates of Greek words. This gambit tended to defeat
the purpose of bringing the tongue of Aristotle down home,
because the cognates often were words the student didn't know
in English (noetic). But, as Heraclitus said, what goes
around comes around.
   These days, the Greek genius is again at work in our
speech, right at the cutting edge of new scientific jargon.
Just the other day, this page was asked to print the word
"biome." This is not a word you will find in Plato, but it is
built on a Greek suffix, -ome, indicating a group (unlike
Astrodome, which is Latin and attracts groups). Biome is even
in the American Heritage Dictionary, which defines it as "a
community of living organisms of a single major ecological
region." Biomedically speaking, the person who coined this
term needs his cephalosome examined and should be exiled to
some other biosphere.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A trend, however, is a trend. Come biome, come genome. And
you don't have to be some chrome-domed gnome to have guessed
that genome means a group of genes. In actual fact,
biologists now use genome to refer collectively to all the
genes in the human body.
   Enthusiasm for this term in the biochemical community, a
subset of the grant-hungry Ph.d-ome, is running high now
because of a scientific cash cow called the genome project,
whose goal is to map every one of the 50,000 to 100,000 genes
evolution has given us. Maybe this is a good thing, and maybe
it will sap funding from more focused gene mapping.
   Why should we care? Because the often hit-or-miss mapping
of our chemical heredity has already solved major medical
mysteries and should solve others. That's the story two
Journal medical reporters, Jerry E. Bishop and Michael
Waldholz, tell in "Genome," (Simon &amp; Schuster, $21.95, 352
pages).
   Their method is an extension of what they do regularly for
this newspaper, mixing solid research, lucid exposition and
illustrative anecdotes in order to bring the news of medical
science to the general public. In "Genome," they combine a
mass of complicated material, which they shape into an always
graceful flow of narrative. But this story was especially
hard to structure, since it is really two stories. One is a
grand sweeping epic of discovery that will continue until the
entire genome is mapped.
   This story begins with the discovery of the laws of
heredity by the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866 and goes
on to the even higher drama of the discovery of the structure
of the genetic material DNA in 1953. Messrs. Bishop and
Waldholz (hereinafter known as B-W) provide a quick refresher
course in all these basics and then slow down to give a
richly human account of the central inspiration that turned
gene mapping into a practical business.
   This bolt from the blue was actually the unexpected
culmination of years of humdrum genealogical record-keeping
by the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City. By the spring of
1979, when various local graduate students in biology and
genetics gathered to discuss their research at the nearby ski
resort of Alta, the church had been permitting geneticists to
use its archives as a data bank for the study of hereditary
diseases. At the Alta meeting, a graduate student spoke about
attempts to map the gene causing hematochromatosis to
chromosome 6. The hunt for that gene had progressed because
researchers had found a "marker" in the chromosome and linked
it with the gene. If only there were other such markers,
another graduate student remarked, other diseases could be
pinned down to specific genes.
   In the audience was a visiting luminary named David
Botstein. "The MIT biologist," B-W write, "was gaining a
reputation somewhat akin to that of a rock star among the
young scientists. A large, barrel-chested man with jet-black
curly hair and a gap-toothed smile, Botstein had a
combination of self-confidence and garrulousness that
graduate students rarely saw in their mentors. He loved to
talk and relished long, often detailed accounts of his
theories and concepts, of his scientific conquests, and of
other scientists' flaws."
   To anyone who knew Mr. Botstein as an earnest
undergraduate dropping unhappily out of a music major into
science, because he didn't think he had what it took
musically, this description will seem especially piquant. But
the real interest of the story is Mr. Botstein's astounding
theoretical improvisation at the Alta meeting, when he
started talking and didn't stop until he had worked out how
the markers the student wanted might be found. He saw that
the state of his science had progressed to the point where
previously unconnected bits of technique could be manipulated
to uncover just those markers the student had wished for.
   "Genome's" second story is a series of episodes in which
scientists pursue those markers and, by luck and toil, find
them. It is an exciting story with profound implications for
the human future.

   Chiat Replaces
   Top Management
   In New York Office

   Chiat/Day/Mojo, hurt by a rash of account losses and
client spending cutbacks, replaced the management of its New
York office.
   Chiat said Jane Newman, who had been president and chief
executive of the office, will be succeeded by Bob Perkins, an
executive who had headed Chiat's direct-marketing unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a further move, Bob Wolf, chairman and chief executive
of North American operations, will act as chairman of the New
York office as well. Mr. Wolf, who works out of the agency's
Venice, Calif., headquarters, will now spend half of each
month in New York.
   Ms. Newman, 42 years old, was given the new title of vice
chairman responsible for strategic planning.
   The reshuffling, which didn't come as a surprise, is
clearly an attempt to revive the troubled New York office.
This year, the agency has lost the following accounts: Reebok
domestic advertising ($40 million), Sara Lee ($12 million),
Bissell carpet cleaning ($10 million) and Mr. Goodbuys, a
Philadelphia retailer. All were serviced primarily out of New
York.
   The $30 million to $35 million Royal Caribbean account,
also based in New York, is currently in review. Mr. Wolf said
the New York office, Chiat's second-largest, currently bills
$125 million, down from a high of about $210 million.
   Problems in New York, combined with troubles on a smaller
scale in other parts of the Chiat empire, prompted the agency
last week to lay off about 40 people and to cut top managers'
pay by at least 10%.
   Ms. Newman, a Briton who had introduced the British
advertising practice of account planning to Chiat, was
considered cold and unapproachable by Chiat's New York staff,
insiders there say.
   The appointment of Mr. Perkins appears aimed at reversing
the morale and leadership problems.
   Mr. Wolf described Mr. Perkins, 44, as "affable" and "a
strong people person," adding, "He is a really good
administrator and new business guy. He's demonstrated an
ability to get the confidence of the {staff} and to win new
business and keep clients happy."
   Aside from client losses, Chiat's New York office has had
a weak new business record lately, and Mr. Wolf said
new-business efforts would be a top priority.
   American Express Co., for which Chiat handles Gold Card
advertising, has slashed its budget this year, while New York
Life Insurance isn't increasing its budget as much as
planned, Mr. Wolf said. Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co.'s Arrow shirt
division has slashed its ad budget at least temporarily as a
result of its March agreement to be acquired by Bidermann
S.A.

   Heinz's O'Reilly Signs 5-Year Contract,
   Receives Options to Buy 4 Million Shares

   PITTSBURGH -- H.J. Heinz Co. Chairman Anthony J.F.
O'Reilly signed a five-year contract that gives the chief
executive officer options to buy four million shares of the
profitable food giant.
   There's a hitch: Mr. O'Reilly can't exercise the options
until 1995. He's banking that Heinz will repeat its
performance of the past five years, in which the return to
shareholders -- which is share price plus dividend
reinvestment -- has grown at a 25% annual compounded rate. If
that growth rate continues until 1995, Mr. O'Reilly could
cash out with a $251 million gain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's one of the largest grants you'll ever find, but he
doesn't make a dime unless the stock appreciates," said
Michael Halloran, executive compensation practice leader at
Towers Perrin Forster &amp; Crosby, a New York consulting firm.
The package reflects a compensation trend in which stock
options are used to align the interests of top executives
with those of shareholders.
   The board negotiated Mr. O'Reilly's contract, his first
ever with the company, to reward his success in building
Heinz into a company that consistently posts record earnings.
Heinz officials also feared the executive would be snatched
away by another company, although they know of no specific
offers. The company also worried that Mr. O'Reilly might
leave Heinz to try his hand as a full-time investor.
   "He's a highly visible person and a very rare executive,"
said James McDonald, a Heinz director who heads the board's
compensation committee. The huge option package, Mr. McDonald
said, "is part of the Heinz philosophy to have the highest
percentage of compensation at risk."
   Mr. O'Reilly couldn't be reached to comment.
   His contract is subject to shareholder approval at next
month's annual meeting. The exercise price of the options is
$29.87, which was Heinz's share price March 14, the day the
contract was signed. In composite trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange, Heinz common closed at $33, up 12.5
cents.
   The 54-year-old Mr. O'Reilly already owns, either outright
or through options, 4.3 million Heinz shares, or 1.69% of the
254.2 million shares outstanding. The additional options on
four million shares could increase his stake to more than 3%.
   The new options could add to Mr. O'Reilly's already
considerable fortune. His financial empire in his homeland of
Ireland is valued at $75 million to $100 million. He's the
principal shareholder in Ireland's largest newspaper chain,
Independent Newspapers PLC, and he has interests in an oil
prospecting company, several hotels, retail chains and other
businesses.
   Under the contract, Mr. O'Reilly's cash compensation
remains about the same. Last year, he earned $534,688 in cash
and other compensation and about $1.4 million in bonuses.
   That puts him about average in his peer group, says Louis
Brindisi Jr., senior partner at Strategic Compensation
Associates, a New York consulting firm. "Is his option plan
the norm? No," said Mr. Brindisi. "But is it the right thing
to do from an investor's point of view? The answer is
probably yes."
   But Bob Miller, a principal at the consulting firm of
Wyatt Co. in San Francisco, believes the option grant was
excessive. "If his base salary is low, how many shares do you
need to make that up?" he said. "If the share price goes up
$1 over the next five years, I doubt the shareholders will be
happy with that, but O'Reilly walks away with $4 million."
   Since he became Heinz chairman 11 years ago, Mr. O'Reilly
has built the company into a $6 billion-a-year operation by
introducing Weight Watchers and other new lines and by
aggressively marketing products in the U.S. and abroad. A
former international rugby star known for his droll wit and
hard-driving personality, Mr. O'Reilly has squeezed profits
from ketchup and potatoes with tight cost controls.

   THE SALARY for H.J. Heinz Co. Chairman Anthony J.F.
O'Reilly in the fiscal year ended May 2 was $708,117 in cash
compensation and $2.6 million in bonuses. In Friday's

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- In Concert:
   Is It a Folk or a Classical Instrument?

   The phone rings in a modest adobe on the outskirts of
Albuquerque, N.M. The answering machine clicks into gear with
a rip-roaring excerpt from "La Bamba," played by Steve Chavez
on the marimba.
   "You're listening to the fastest hands this side of the
Rio Grande]" proclaims the recorded message. But Mr. Chavez,
a fixture at local cocktail lounges and conventions, wins
kudos for more than his fleet fingers. Since 1981, when he
bought his first Mexican marimba while visiting relatives in
Veracruz, he has endeavored to preserve the rich but
increasingly endangered folk tradition of playing these
oversized xylophones brought to tropical America by African
slaves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Each year, the soft-spoken American travels to the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas, near the Guatemalan
border, where he hangs out with the dwindling number of
old-timers who still play the marimba in the traditional
style. "I've worked with some of the masters," says the
classically trained marimbist, who has a B.A. in music
education from the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque.
"I can analyze their playing in terms of chords and
dynamics."
   In the process, he's developed a mind-boggling technique.
On a November 1989 segment of the Southwestern
public-television program "Colores," he demonstrated a
"ripple roll," his virtuosic variation on an authentic
Mexican method for repeating notes in rapid-fire succession.
Mr. Chavez has also acquired eight Mexican marimbas, which he
carted home one by one in a '76 Ford van outfitted with
specially cushioned holders to protect the instrument's
fragile legs and resonators.
   Unlike their modern counterparts, Mexican marimbas have
wooden, rather than aluminum, resonator tubes and are often
elaborately carved. The 34-year-old musician's current
collection includes some old African and Guatemalan
instruments that have bulbous gourds for resonators, and a
new model he is building that is decorated with turquoise
stones and a colored sand painting.
   "I'm the Liberace of the marimba," he jokes. The most
unusual feature of these instruments is a component called
"La tela" (cloth or skin) -- a little piece of bat's wing or
pig intestine stretched across a hole at the bottom of each
resonator pipe that gives the folk marimba its characteristic
"buzz." "It sounds like a kazoo," says Mr. Chavez, a short,
stocky man who wears his long black hair in a ponytail. "It
gives more carrying power for playing outdoors in the plazas
and parks.
   With his flexibly sized New Mexican Marimba Band, Mr.
Chavez performs more than 150 dates a year throughout the
Southwest, playing his own lively improvisations on
traditional folk tunes as well as more-standard fare. Last
May, his one-movement work for marimba and chamber orchestra
was premiered by the Orchestra of Santa Fe; he hopes it will
stimulate interest in his other compositions, including a
nine-movement piece that employs Indian hoop dancers. In the
meantime, he takes time out from his busy schedule to
demonstrate marimba techniques in local elementary schools
and colleges.
   "It's the only hope for the future," he sighs. "In Mexico,
the kids are all walking around with headsets listening to
American rock."
   Thousands of miles away in Asbury Park, N.J., another
classically trained marimbist pursues a different dream: to
elevate the modern marimba to the status of a solo recital
instrument. "I'd like to do for the marimba," says Leigh
Howard Stevens, "what Segovia did for the guitar." That
sounds like an unattainable goal, but the indefatigable Mr.
Stevens is waging an all-out offensive. He plays everything
from Bach transcriptions to contemporary concertos --
literature once deemed impossible for an unaccompanied
performer -- with the technical panache of a Horowitz.
   "Leigh set a performance standard," says John Beck,
marimba instructor at the Eastman School of Music and Mr.
Stevens's former teacher, "that hadn't been known previously.
He introduced the one-handed roll {similar to a tremolo on
the piano} and took four-mallet playing to a higher level."
Most classical marimbists use the traditional cross-stick
grip to hold the mallets scissor-like in their palms. Mr.
Stevens's finger-held grip, a modification of a method
pioneered by an earlier virtuoso, allows rotary motion (vs.
the usual up-and-down strokes) and an impressive separation
of melodic lines.
   "Leigh's use of the mallets," observes percussionist Jeff
Milarsky, a recent Juilliard graduate who plans to teach the
"Stevens" grip to his students, "is almost like piano playing
in its independence."
   Indeed, his 1987 disk of Bach transcriptions for
Musicmasters was a real eye-opener, proving that the marimba
can be played with the same legato touch and coloristic
effects as a violin. The Prelude and Fugue in B-flat Major is
especially remarkable in its contrapuntal clarity and
musicality. Mr. Stevens has also tackled the mechanics of
marimba playing. In 1971, frustrated by the limitations of
traditional rattan mallets, he developed a birchwood handle
mallet to give him a wider reach on his instrument. "I was
considered somewhat of a loon," he recalls. "When you're used
to rattan, birch-wood mallets feel like driving a car without
shock absorbers."
   More recently, the 37-year-old musician began
collaborating with the Ludwig Musser Co. in Indiana, a
leading percussion manufacturer. The effort yielded the
Musser "Plus One," a $12,000 concert instrument with an
extended range and a more accurate tuning system than
standard models, which usually sell in the $3,500 to $8,000
range. While his technical innovations win raves, the 35
works he has commissioned for solo marimba draw mixed
reviews. "They're of debatable musical value," says one
colleague.
   Mr. Stevens prefers to "let listeners decide whether {the
composers} are deservedly obscure or unknown greats." But he
concedes that "you need some measure of success before you
can approach prominent composers like John Corigliano and
Joseph Schwantner, both of whom are now writing pieces for
me."
   Would the marimba be better served by works that draw on
its folk heritage? Mr. Stevens hedges on that one. "Whether
in folk music or concert music," he declares, "the marimba
speaks to the soul in a way that few instruments can
achieve."

   NARCOTICS IN JAPAN

   Japan's affluence has made it a target for international
narcotics cartels, and it must act fast to escape the
drug-inflicted maladies of other wealthy societies, a United
Nations official said.
   "Japan needs immediate action, or its economy could be
easily destroyed by drug-trafficking," Giuseppe di Gennaro,
executive director of the U.N. Fund for Drug Abuse Control,
said in Tokyo. The amount of intercepted cocaine smuggled
into Japan in the first six months of 1990 was 137 pounds, up
from only three pounds in the same period in 1989, Japanese
police said.
   "The fact that such a large quantity of drugs was seized
in this country is evidence that there are already
well-constructed distribution networks here," Mr. di Gennaro
said.
   Illegal drug use is still rare in Japan, and penalties are
severe. Sentences of life imprisonment are possible for
cocaine and heroin trafficking.
                                                                                                       

   BRAZIL'S ANTI-SMOKING CAMPAIGN
                                                                                                       

   Brazil's Health Ministry said smoking would be prohibited
on domestic airline flights of two hours or less. The new
rule will take effect after a public-education campaign by
the airlines and the Department of Civilian Aviation, the
ministry said. It said it also was considering creating
special shuttle flights for smokers. Three months ago, the
government approved a package of anti-smoking measures
including a ban on cigarette sales to minors and prohibition
of cigarette ads on television between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.
                                                                                                       

   NO INTER-KOREAN TRAVEL

   North Korea effectively rejected a South Korean proposal
to open the Korean border to unrestricted travel for five
days next week. By repeating its longstanding demand for the
repeal of Seoul's anti-communist national security laws, the
North appeared to have squelched any last-minute chance to
set in motion the procedures to allow inter-Korean exchanges.
The North also imposed two other conditions unlikely to be
met by South Korea: that the South allow a North Korean
"consolation" team to visit jailed dissidents in the South
and that it permit South Korean dissidents to attend a
unification rally at the border on Aug. 15.
                                                                                                       

   CORRUPTION IN CHINA
                                                                                                       

   China disciplined 17,000 government officials in the first
half of this year for corruption and other illegal
activities, an official report said. One-third of the 23,645
cases of official wrongdoing filed from January through June
involved bribery and embezzlement. Other cases involved
"violation of economic policies," profiteering, abuse of
power for personal gain and dereliction of duty, the Xinhua
news agency reported. Most of those punished were local
officials, the report said.

   Nissho Iwai Corp., a Japanese trading house, will set up a
wholly owned subsidiary within a month to sell Mercedes-Benz
automobiles in the Tokyo area, a company spokesman said. The
announcement reflected a move by Mercedes-Benz Japan to
expand the network of dealerships selling its models imported
from the West German parent company, Mercedes-Benz AG. The
new subsidiary will have a showroom and a service shop in
central Tokyo.

   Vietnam is banning cigarette imports because they drain
foreign exchange and hurt the local industry, the official
Vietnam News Agency reported. The order bans the import,
circulation and consumption of foreign-made cigarettes
starting Oct. 1, the agency said. The report said diplomats,
foreign businessmen and officials of international
organizations were exempt from the ban but must obtain
permits from the Ministry of Trade. If they sell the
foreign-made cigarettes, that would be considered smuggling,
the report said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ZEALAND CHAMPAGNE RULING
                                                                                                       

   A New Zealand High Court judge has ruled that only wines
produced in the Champagne region of France can be labeled as
champagne for local sale.
   The judgment was the result of a lawsuit brought by the
Comite Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne, a French
champagne producers' agency, against Wineworths Group Ltd., a
New Zealand liquor concern that distributes Australian wine
labeled as champagne. The producers' agency was joined in the
lawsuit by French companies Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin S.A.,
Champagne Lanson Pere et Fils and Champagne Bollinger S.A.
   Wineworths's defense of the lawsuit was funded by Penfolds
Ltd., an Australian wine producer that markets Seaview brand
wine under the champagne label.

   NEW YORK -- The stock market continued its rebound as
encouraging words on the Middle East situation and a rise in
bond prices inspired further bargain-hunting.
   But the pace of trading, which had been brisk ever since
Iraq invaded Kuwait one week ago, slowed substantially as
many participants retreated to the sidelines to await further
details on the conflict.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Events now have reached the point where it's a
wait-and-see attitude in terms of the Middle East," said
Larry Greenwald, a block trader at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which gained 24.26
Wednesday, rose 24.01 to 2758.91. New York Stock Exchange
trading was the lightest since July 30 as 155,810,000 shares
changed hands.
   Broader measures also posted solid gains, but didn't keep
pace with the Dow Jones industrials. For example, Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 1.59 to 339.94 -- a 0.47% rise,
compared with a gain of 0.88% in the industrial average.
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went up 0.84
to 186.24 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 1.75
to 315.31. Advancing issues topped decliners on the Big Board
by 837 to 695.
   After drifting in narrow ranges through the first half of
the session, prices turned higher as the market responded to
a Pentagon statement that the Iraqi forces in Kuwait "seem to
be in a defensive posture."
   Stocks rallied to session highs in late trading after the
completion of the Treasury's auction of $10.26 billion in
30-year bonds, the third and final leg of its quarterly
refunding, which drew a better-than-expected response from
investors.
   Treasury notes and bonds moved higher in response to the
auction results, which arrived on the heels of Wednesday's
disappointing sale of 10-year notes. In late trading,
long-term Treasury issues were up 3/4 point, or $7.50 per
$1,000 face amount.
   Stock buyers continued to concentrate on issues of
companies expected to deliver solid earnings growth.
   Procter &amp; Gamble rose 7/8 to 80 7/8; the company posted a
14% increase in earnings for the fiscal quarter ended in June
after factoring out a restructuring charge, taken in the
year-ago period.
   Boeing, a favorite among growth stocks, gained 1 1/2 to 54
1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 1.8 million shares.
   Philip Morris rose 7/8 to 46 1/2 on 1.5 million shares,
Coca-Cola climbed 3/4 to 44 3/4, Merck gained 7/8 to 86 and
ConAgra rose 1 to 33 3/4.
   Wal-Mart Stores added 3/8 to 30 5/8 and topped the list of
most active issues on the Big Board, as about 2.8 million
shares changed hands. The retailer reported increases of
24.6% in fiscal second-quarter net income and 8% in July
sales at stores open at least one year.
   Retailers reported that apparel sales were strong last
month, and the news spurred buying in issues such as Limited
Inc., which advanced 1 1/4 to 19 5/8 on 1.5 million shares,
and Gap Inc., which rose 2 to 55 3/4. Limited's sales for
stores open at least one year rose 6%; at Gap, the increase
was 28%.
   Other retailing issues were mixed; Sears Roebuck rose 7/8
to 30 1/2, K mart eased 3/8 to 30 3/8, J.C. Penney dropped
7/8 to 52 1/4, May Department Stores rose 2 3/4 to 46 3/4 and
Woolworth added 1/4 to 29 1/8.
   Continental Airlines Holdings, which confirmed that Frank
Lorenzo is stepping down as chairman and chief executive
officer and selling most of his stake to Scandinavian
Airlines System, rose 1 3/4 to 6 1/4 in heavy trading on the
American Stock Exchange. Composite trading amounted to 2.3
million shares.
   Delta Air Lines rose 3/4 to 60 3/8 after disclosing plans
to raise fares 10%, starting next Wednesday, to offset higher
jet fuel costs. AMR, which owns American Airlines, rose 3/4
to 52 and USAir Group rose 3/4 to 20 1/2.
   But UAL, the parent of United Airlines, fell 3/4 to 113
3/4 following news of its plans to increase fares 5.3% on all
domestic flights as of next Wednesday. The stock traded as
high as 123 in the wake of its board's 60-day extension of a
deadline for a union-led group to arrange financing for its
$4.38 billion buy-out offer.
   Hewlett-Packard fell 1 1/2 to 37 and traded as low as 36
1/8, a 52-week low. Analysts attributed the stock's drop to
worries that the company's results for its fiscal third
quarter, to be reported Thursday, might be weaker than
expected, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report.
   Earlier this week, Kidder Peabody analyst David R. Korus
lowered his earnings estimates on Hewlett-Packard for fiscal
1990 and 1991, citing expectations that several of the
company's core businesses will remain sluggish. Mr. Korus
also lowered his third-quarter projection from 75 cents a
share to a range of 65 cents to 70 cents a share, according
to the investor report.
   Chemical Waste Management added 1 1/8 to 22 1/4. The
company disclosed that a federal appeals court overturned an
Alabama law which has blocked it from importing waste into
the state from several other states for disposal. Waste
Management, which owns a 78% stake in the company, gained 3/4
to 39 7/8.
   Kay Jewelers rose 1 7/8 to 12 7/8 before trading was
halted late in the session. After the close, Britain's
Ratners Group said it would raise its offer for two issues of
Kay junk bonds to 90% of their principal amount from 75% -- a
move that could clear the way for Ratners to complete its
$17-a-share takeover offer.
   Sara Lee, whose earnings for the June quarter rose 13% and
were in line with expectations, climbed 1 1/8 to 27 3/4.
   Bell Industries added 1 to 15 3/8. The company reported
that earnings for the June quarter nearly doubled from a year
earlier.
   Chili's gained 1 to 32 3/8. Lehman Brothers upgraded its
short-term investment rating on the issue and added it to a
list of recommended growth stocks.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.46
to 341.49. Volume totaled 13,540,000 shares.

   Operating Profit
   At Coors Units
   Rose in Quarter

   GOLDEN, Colo. -- Adolph Coors Co.'s non-beer businesses
reported operating profit of about $10 million in the second
quarter, compared with about $2 million in the year earlier
period, marking the first time the non-beer operations
contributed significantly to the company's bottom line, Coors
chief financial officer, Harold Smethills, said.
   "These businesses are coming into their own," Mr.
Smethills said. Coors began its diversification in 1910, when
it bought a small ceramics company here. The brewer started
to develop additional businesses during the past decade,
including the manufacturing of ceramic parts for electronics,
aluminum processing, and packaging and biotechnology
businesses. The company began reporting its non-beer
operating profit by segments in the first quarter of 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the second quarter, the company reported operating
profit of about $4.7 million for its ceramics business
compared with about $2 million in the year-ago second
quarter. The second quarter profit more than made up for a
first-quarter loss in that business, which was due to a $7
million write-down for work force adjustments, resulting in
$200,000 in operating profit for the first half of the year.
Aluminum manufacturing, which includes the production of
aluminum sheets for can lids and tabs for both Coors and
other can users, reported operating profit for the second
quarter of about $5 million compared with less than $1
million a year ago.
   The company's other businesses, which include Graphics
Packaging Corp., a biotechnology company, an energy company
and a small business incubator, reported operating profit of
about $200,000 for the quarter, compared with a loss of about
$900,000 in the year-ago quarter. The segment's performance
was led by the packaging business, which had "much stronger
sales, lower costs and more efficient operations" compared
with the year-ago second quarter, Mr. Smethills said.
   The company's biotechnology division, which is just
starting to market some commercial nutritional ingredients,
reported a loss, but the losses were substantially smaller
than before, Mr. Smethills said.
   Meanwhile, the company's flagship beer business reported
increased beer shipments of 14% and an increase in operating
profit of about 25%. The improvements were due to a
comparison with a poor second quarter in 1989 and due to
increased shipments of Coors Light. In addition, the company
introduced Keystone, its popular-priced beer, in the third
quarter of 1989, significantly boosting beer sales.
   "Our diversification strategy that we've been talking
about for about 10 years is starting to provide a return to
our shareholders," said Mr. Smethills. Currently about 38% of
Coors' $1.6 billion in assets is held by its non-beer
businesses. "The overall return on equity isn't where we want
it yet," he said, "but we're making progress." Coors has
stated that it wants to make a 10% return in each of its
businesses.
   Earlier, Coors reported second-quarter earnings of $25.1
million on sales of $475.3 million, compared with
year-earlier profit of $16.8 million on sales of $425.5
million.

   Law:
   Plaintiffs Strike a Blow to Shift Blame
   For Accidents Caused by Their Own Acts

   Shortly before Christmas 1985, Raymond Belknap shot
himself in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun after drinking
beer and listening to heavy metal music. Now, a Nevada court
is trying to determine just who is to blame for Mr. Belknap's
death.
   Judges and juries have become increasingly willing to
allow plaintiffs to spread -- and in some cases shift
entirely -- the responsibility for tragic events caused by
their own behavior.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some legal specialists say the courts are sending a
message to consumers that their own role in accidents is no
longer important. And they say the Belknap case is one of
several pending around the country that may change the legal
meaning of personal responsibility.
   Defense lawyers see that as an ominous prospect. They say
consumers are forced to pay for the misbehavior of others in
higher prices and the unavailability of new products. The
American Ladder Institute, a trade group, says 15% to 25% of
a ladder's price goes to legal and liability costs. Most
suits, the group says, are brought by plaintiffs harmed in
accidents while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
   Twenty-five years ago, most juries couldn't have returned
a verdict in favor of a plaintiff if he was in any way
responsible for his injuries. Now most states let juries and
courts weigh the fault of each party. In some states, a
company found to be as little as 1% responsible for an
accident may be held liable for some of the damages.
   The new rules developed partly out of a belief by many
judges that corporations are better equipped than individuals
both to prevent accidents and to absorb their cost. "People
do stupid things because they don't expect the consequences
to occur," says John F. Banzhaf III, a product liability
specialist with the George Washington University National Law
Center. "Corporate behavior is readily affected by changes in
the legal rules. Individual behavior is not."
   Worries over these liability issues have attracted the
attention of Congress. Robert W. Kasten Jr. (R., Wis.) and 30
other senators have sponsored a bill that would bar
plaintiffs who were under the influence of alcohol or drugs
from collecting damages if their condition was more than 50%
responsible for their injuries. The bill's sponsors have
reasoned that society shouldn't bear the costs of such
accidents and that the measure "will encourage persons to
take responsibility for their own safety and the safety of
others."
   The Belknap case, in state court in Reno, is being closely
watched because the makers of albums -- unlike makers of
power lawn mowers or swimming pools -- have generally been
shielded from such suits by the First Amendment. Two similar
cases, involving the rock singer Ozzy Osbourne, are pending
in Georgia.
   Mr. Belknap's parents say subliminal messages in the music
of heavy metal band Judas Priest induced their son to kill
himself. And they say the band, CBS Records, which
distributed the album, and CBS Inc. bear responsibility. (As
part of its purchase of CBS Records in 1988, Sony Corp.
agreed that the record unit would pay any judgment against
CBS Inc.) The judge in the case ruled that subliminal
messages aren't protected by the First Amendment.
   Kenneth McKenna, a lawyer for the Belknaps, says CBS is
liable because the company should have foreseen that someone
such as Mr. Belknap might respond violently to the music.
"Drinking beer, smoking pot, being a dropout from school, and
having depression is normal for a Judas Priest purchaser,"
says Mr. McKenna, a Reno lawyer. "CBS and Judas Priest failed
to protect for that lowest-common-denominator consumer." The
parents of James Vance, who shot himself in the same incident
but survived, are also plaintiffs in the suit.
   CBS argues that Mr. Belknap and Mr. Vance were troubled
youths who abused drugs and alcohol and whose behavior wasn't
connected to the music.
   Plaintiffs' lawyers contend that people shouldn't bear
sole blame for behavior encouraged at least partly by others.
In 1985, Eric Abreu, then seven years old, fell off a
15-foot-high sculpture in a Manhattan playground accident
that left him a quadriplegic. Lawyers for the city argued
that, while tragic, the accident could have been avoided
because Eric's mother had warned him not to climb the
sculpture.
   A jury verdict in the city's favor was thrown out by the
judge, and a state appeals court ordered a new trial. Harvey
Weitz, who represented Eric at the second trial, says the
city knew children were climbing to the top of the sculpture
and should have had safeguards. In the new trial, a jury
found Eric bore a small part of the blame but awarded him
$33.3 million in damages. The award, later cut by the judge
to $11.5 million, is on appeal.
   D. Daniel Engstrand Jr., a partner in the New York law
firm Doniger, Garland &amp; Engstrand, who represented the city
at the second trial, says he personally feels Eric is
entitled to some compensation, but calls the enormous verdict
"a miscarriage since Eric's {behavior} played a great deal in
the injury he sustained, and he knew he should not climb up
there."
   In some recent cases, juries and judges have been
receptive to plaintiffs' claims that they can't be blamed for
their behavior if the harmful consequences of their actions
aren't commonly known. The rulings have opened up new
liability for alcohol distillers, who had been protected from
product-liability suits on the grounds that the risks of
drinking are well-known.
   In November 1983, college freshman Marie Brinkmeyer died
after an evening of drinking shots of tequila with some
friends in Kingsville, Texas. Her mother sued Brown-Forman
Inc., the distiller that made the tequila, alleging the
company should have warned consumers about possible dangers.
   In 1988, a state appeals court in Corpus Christi, Texas,
reversed a lower court's dismissal of the suit. The appeals
panel wasn't convinced that the public understood that
consuming excessive quantities of alcohol can result in death
and that a trial should be held on the issue of whether
Brown-Forman had a duty to warn consumers of that hazard. A
trial is set for next year in Corpus Christi.
   James B. Ragan, a lawyer for the plaintiff, says it isn't
fair to blame Ms. Brinkmeyer for her death. Advertising
portrays drinking as glamorous and plays down possible
dangers, he says. "She's a victim of the misperception of
alcohol as something worthwhile and enjoyable," says Mr.
Ragan, a Corpus Christi lawyer. Lawyers for Brown-Forman say
they can't comment because the case is pending.
   A federal appeals court in Philadelphia in 1988 reversed a
lower court's dismissal and ordered a trial in the case of
William Hon, who died of pancreatitis at the age of 26. The
suit, brought by his wife, alleged that Mr. Hon consumed two
to three cans of Stroh Brewery Co.'s beer four nights a week
for six years. The court wrote that the public was unaware of
the risk of pancreatitis from moderate, though long-term,
consumption of beer, and that Stroh could be held liable for
failing to warn of the risk. A trial is scheduled for October
in federal district court in Scranton, Pa. A lawyer for Stroh
says he can't comment because the case is pending.
   Plaintiffs' lawyers say they are unsure what effect a new
federal law requiring alcoholic-beverage containers to carry
health warnings will have on such suits. But these lawyers
say a recent decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in a
suit involving cigarette smoking could be harmful to the
alcoholic beverage industry.
   In 1982, Claire Dewey filed suit in Hackensack, N.J.,
against Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., American Brands
Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., alleging that they are
liable for the death of her husband, Wilfred Dewey, from lung
cancer at age 49. Mr. Dewey smoked Camels, Tareytons and
Viceroys for 40 years.
   In the decision, reached in July, the New Jersey high
court ruled that Mrs. Dewey can proceed with her lawsuit
because Congress didn't intend to immunize cigarette makers
against such suits when they ordered warnings on cigarette
packages in 1966. Courts previously had found that the
federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act protected
tobacco companies from liability.
   The notion that a consumer can sue a tobacco company after
years of smoking and despite warning labels is "a sign our
legal system has gone awry," says Martin London, a partner in
the New York firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, a
lawyer for Brown &amp; Williamson. "It is a kind of thinking that
is totally at odds with the history and spirit of American
jurisprudence and social mores." Brown &amp; Williamson, a unit
of B.A.T Industries PLC, and R.J. Reynolds, a unit of RJR
Nabisco Inc., haven't yet decided whether to appeal; American
Brands didn't participate in the appeal before the state high
court.
   Marc Z. Edell, a partner in the Short Hills, N.J., law
firm of Budd, Larner, Gross, Rosenbaum, Greenberg &amp; Sade, a
lawyer for Mrs. Dewey, says companies bear responsibility
because they deliberately attempt to undermine warning labels
through ads and other means.

   Dispute Over Safety Claims

   Safer Inc., Newton, Mass., said it agreed to settle a
dispute with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
concerning promotional safety claims the closely held concern
has made about its biodegradable pesticides.
   In July 1989 the EPA filed an administrative complaint
against the company, charging that its literature violated
federal laws prohibiting safety claims in pesticide
advertising. Safer argues that the laws were drafted before
relatively benign pesticides such as its "insecticidal soaps"
were available, and so are "outdated" and shouldn't apply to
its products, which it has advertised as nontoxic.
Furthermore, Safer noted, the EPA hasn't questioned the
safety of its products -- only the language used to promote
them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said that under its consent decree with the
EPA, it will pay a $10,000 civil penalty and undertake a
program of "environmentally beneficial expenditures promoting
the safe use of pesticides." Safer added that it agreed to
the settlement to avoid "costly and protracted" litigation.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Polaroid Corp. announced it will build
a $90 million plant in New Bedford, Mass., to manufacture
advanced films for the company's new electronic imaging
products.
   The new, 250,000 square foot manufacturing facility,
expected to be in operation by late 1992, will employ more
than 100 people in producing a "wide range of new products,
including advanced film for our new laser-based medical
diagnostic imaging system known as Helios," said I.
MacAllister Booth, Polaroid president and chief executive
officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first product in its Helios line will be a specialized
laser printer for use with ultrasound and nuclear medicine
scanners. The printer will make hard-copy images for
examination within 90 seconds, the company said. Currently,
such images take up to 20 minutes to develop.
   Polaroid said its Helios line is aimed initially at
seizing a piece of the $3 billion world-wide annual market
for medical-imaging film. The products will target the
approximately 25% of the market devoted to film used with
electronic and computerized imaging systems, such as
ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scanners.
Future Helios products will be aimed at graphic arts
applications and scientific uses, such as seismic imaging.
   Polaroid has suffered from steadily weakening sales since
the decline of the instant photography market in the 1970s.

   Soviet Dump Serves
   As a Mall to Many
   And Home to Some

   Leningrad Residents Find
   Wide Selection, Bargains
   Available Among Refuse

   LENINGRAD, U.S.S.R. -- Alexei Sichev needs a washing
basin, so he's come to Leningrad's biggest shopping mall --
the city dump.
   Neatly dressed in a tweedy jacket, slacks and clean shoes,
the 73-year-old former engineer from Novy Petrodvoretz flips
over a hunk of old wood and pokes at a mound of rotting
paper.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I just need one for myself, but there aren't any in the
shops," he complains. "I was told there would be here."
   Other shoppers have come to the same conclusion. Dotted
across the mountains of garbage are people bent over and
busily checking out what the dump has to offer. Some are
looking for specific things, others for anything that strikes
their fancy.
   Some, of course, are drawn by the rock-bottom prices. But
many would willingly pay in an ordinary shop if they could
only find something to buy.
   Twenty miles away on Leningrad's shopping avenue, Nevsky
Prospect, new hard-currency shops cater to tourists and
people swarm around the ice cream stands. But in the
crumbling pastel-colored buildings that were once the center
of Czarist fashion, the state-run stores offer few items and
almost no variety.
   Soviets rarely even use the words "to shop" or "to buy"
when they describe how they came to own something. Rather,
they say "dostat," a word which falls between "to get" and
"to acquire" and is thick with the nuance of pulling strings,
leaning on friends, manipulating bureaucrats and waiting.
That's what it takes for a consumer to connect with a product
here.
   Yuri wants to get his daughter a bicycle, but he's not
powerful enough to pull any very big strings. He's raising
three kids on his disability pay of 97 rubles a month (about
$160 at the official exchange rate or $16 at the more
realistic tourist rate) and his wife's 130 ruble monthly
salary.
   A slight man with a timid manner, he's a little
embarrassed to be shopping at the dump. Like many others, he
doesn't want to give his name. But hoisting his satchel on
his shoulder, he strides resolutely up the dirt road toward
the mountains of trash.
   "There's nothing in the stores," he says, "and here there
is."
   Some people see good business prospects in the dump. On
one hill, three large mounds of clothing are loosely
organized by material. They'll be sold in town by some
energetic entrepreneur.
   On the opposite hill, a wisp of steam rises from a large
rusty double-sink. An elderly man in a worn woolen military
jacket and cap scrubs labels and grime off bottles he has
collected, and a row of clean blue jars glistens in the sun.
   The official dump workers are friendly and almost
protective toward these budding capitalists. A worker breaks
off his chat with the bottle-washer to stomp over in his
heavy rubber boots. "Don't bother him -- what do you want? He
isn't doing anything wrong."
   Indeed, it's not so bad at the Leningrad dump. When the
wind blows the right way, it hardly smells at all because so
little food is thrown out in the Soviet Union. Food shortages
make people economize -- a chicken roasted one day is turned
into a casserole the second and soup on the third.
   Some people have even made the dump their home. On the far
side of the last rotting hill several families lived in tents
until a few weeks ago.
   Then Leningrad Television's highly popular muckraking show
"600 seconds" publicized the story and the government moved
in to clean out the embarrassment. The bulldozer tracks are
still visible among the crushed wild daisies and the
fragments of cloth left behind.
   The idea of people scavenging in dumps wouldn't shock
anyone in New York, but here in the "worker's paradise," such
realities were long seen as the dregs of capitalism. Even
after five years of glasnost, people are shocked to find such
things going on in their own back yard.
   "We knew we didn't live as well here as in the West, but
we thought we had social protection and that at least no one
was homeless or starving," says Nadia, a waitress who herself
lives in an 9-by-12 room with her husband and child and
shares the kitchen and bath with a stranger assigned to the
communal apartment. She saw the program on television.
   "It's disgusting," says Fyodr, a taxi driver and native of
Leningrad who saw the dump life for the first time. "There
goes Glorious Communism."
   No one knows exactly what happened to the dump dwellers.
One wary dump official insists they'd been given apartments
in the city, an idea that makes Leningraders roll their eyes
because apartments are desperately hard to come by. The dump
manager says the families always had permission to live in
the city, but just preferred to live at the dump where they
could be irresponsible.
   "Anyway, even if they're not living here anymore, there
are more living at the other city dumps," he says. "And those
other dumps aren't as nice as this one."

   Schering-Plough
   Withdraws Drug
   From Distribution

<LP>
   Schering-Plough Corp. said it withdrew a new blood
pressure drug from world-wide distribution after 17 patients
using the medication developed liver complications.
   The drug, known generically as dilevalol hydrochloride,
was sold only in Japan and Portugal. In January, an advisory
panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had
recommended approval for marketing in the U.S., but the FDA
itself hadn't yet acted on the recommendation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Schering previously projected annual sales for dilevalol
at up to $200 million, a company spokesman said. In composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Schering
closed at $47 a share, up 50 cents. The company's
announcement came after the close of trading.
   "It certainly isn't positive" for the company, said Marc
Mayer, a drug industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co. "But I don't see it as a major hit."
   The company said sales of the drug in Portugal and Japan
totaled $20 million since it was introduced in both countries
last winter. Withdrawing the drug won't have a material
impact on 1990 earnings, the company added, which are still
expected to increase by 18% to 20% over 1989 levels.
   Schering, based in Madison, N.J., said more than 175,000
patients have used the drug, including 36,000 in clinical
trials. Of the 17 cases of liver damage, 16 patients returned
to normal after they stopped taking the drug. The 17th
patient died, although Schering said the company wasn't
certain that the drug itself caused the death, which occurred
in Japan.
   "Although the actual number of hepatotoxicity cases was
quite small in relation to the number of patients using
dilevalol, our decision was taken in the best interest of the
potential patient population for the drug," said Alexander Z.
Lane, president, Schering-Plough Research.
   The company said it was aware of only three cases of liver
damage when the FDA advisory panel reviewed Schering's
clinical data. The remaining cases surfaced more recently.
   Dilevalol is classified as a beta blocker, which helps
control blood pressure by blocking nerve impulses that
regulate the heart beat.

   Despite better-than-expected sales of television sets,
N.V. Philips posted a sharp drop in second-quarter earnings,
and the Dutch electronics company reaffirmed that it expects
a huge loss for the full year.
   Net profit plunged 84% to 37 million guilders ($21
million), or 13 Dutch cents a share, from 235 million
guilders ($131 million), or 91 Dutch cents a share, a year
earlier. The drop reflects red ink from the computer and
semiconductor operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts, however, had forecast a small loss for the
quarter.
   Sales in the latest quarter edged down to 13.54 billion
guilders from 13.55 billion guilders. Net in the year-earlier
quarter included an extraordinary gain of 38 million
guilders.
   In early July, Philips's new chairman, Jan Timmer,
announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs, or about 3.5% of the
company's world-wide total, and to make provisions for 2.7
billion guilders of restructuring costs, to be recorded in
the second half. Those provisions will leave the company with
a loss of about two billion guilders for all of 1990, Philips
forecast.
   Some analysts have predicted that Philips won't pay a
dividend this year, but a spokesman said no decision has been
made on that question. He said it would depend on progress of
the company's cost-cutting moves and the general course of
business.
   Eleanor Buss, an analyst at Robert Fleming Securities,
predicted yesterday that Philips would pay a dividend,
particularly because many of its shareholders are retired
people who rely on the income. Dorian Foyil of UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew Securities said he expects Philips to reduce its
dividend by about 50% from last year's two guilders per share
and to pay it in the form of shares rather than cash.
   For the first half, net profit slipped 19% to 373 million
guilders, or 1.34 guilders a share, from 458 million
guilders, or 1.77 guilders a share. The latest period's net
included 330 million guilders of extraordinary gains, mostly
from the sale of defense units, compared with 38 million
guilders of gains a year before. Before extraordinary items,
profit plunged 90% to 43 million guilders from 420 million
guilders, partly because of higher financing costs.
   Sales in the half rose 1% to 26.36 billion guilders from
26.2 billion guilders. After stripping out the effects of
currency changes and asset sales, sales were up 8%, the
company said.
   Operating profit at the consumer products division in the
first half surged 73% to 825 million guilders, and sales rose
11% to 11.48 billion guilders. The company said June's World
Cup soccer championship spurred sales of television sets and
video recorders.
   In the lighting division, long regarded as Philips's
strong point, operating profit dropped 19% to 327 million
guilders on a 6% decline in sales to 3.54 billion guilders.
The company said prices were pushed down by "fierce
competition" in Europe and the U.S. but "remained at an
acceptable level." A spokesman said the division also was
hurt by a slowdown in the construction industry.
   The professional products and systems division showed an
operating loss of 126 million, compared with profit of 85
million guilders a year earlier. Sales declined 13% to 6.13
billion guilders.
   The division includes telecommunications,
medical-electronics and computer equipment and other items.
Philips said all lines in the division showed improvement,
except for computers, which produced a major loss. Analysts
estimated the loss at more than 250 million guilders. Philips
has announced plans to scale back computer operations,
focusing on assembling systems from standardized products and
on serving certain segments of the market, such as financial
companies.
   Philips's other major problem area, components, showed an
operating loss of 59 million guilders, compared with a profit
of 4 million guilders. Sales were flat at 4.2 billion
guilders. The company said its loss on integrated circuits
was slightly smaller than a year earlier but that results
from color-television picture tubes and other electronic
components deteriorated, mainly because of adverse
exchange-rate movements.
   The company said its results also were hurt by Brazil's
economic austerity program. Latin America accounted for 18%
of Philips's operating profit last year, and Brazil is by far
the company's biggest market in the region.

   Arizona's Real Estate Has
   Lost Its Place in the Sun

   PHOENIX -- In the shadows of the White Tank Mountains 40
miles northwest of here, deep in the desert where few but
developers dare to tread, the Sun Valley Parkway bends across
an overheated wasteland of cactus and low scrub. It's a fine
Arizona road, wide, flat, unspoiled, and a straight shot into
the shimmering heart of real-estate disaster.
   For the Sun Valley Parkway is a road to nowhere, virtually
useless except as metaphor for all the grandiose notions and
crazy schemes and alleged fraud that have left Arizona with
its worst land and lending mess ever.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Built by a partnership of some 1,000 private investors at
a cost of $82 million in 1987, the road was supposed to
provide easy access to the community of Sun Valley. That
there was no community of Sun Valley at the time did not
deter the confident investors, who were led by one Robert
Burns, a Phoenix developer who dreamed up the project. That
little detail would be taken care of in due time, by building
a lovely retirement resort on 48,000 acres of maximum desert
that had been purchased by those same investors for roughly
$100 million more of borrowed money. There would be golf
courses and swimming pools and 300,000 happy residents, and
it would all be worth some $34 billion someday, the
developers calculated.
   Today there is just the road, a welter of lawsuits and a
handful of mysteries in the desert suggesting past human
activity of indeterminate purpose. A green highway sign
proclaims that Sun Valley is eight miles up ahead; someone
has defaced the sign with red spray paint. Eight miles up
ahead are a few bulldozer scratches in the sand, some cement
drainage ditches and a solitary sign marking the nonexistent
intersection of Sun Valley Parkway and 29th Avenue. A fat
dead rodent is draped over that sign, fittingly if
inexplicably. It is as desolate and eerie as ruins left by
any other seemingly advanced civilization that stretched too
far in search of gold or conquest.
   "Sun Valley," remarks Ralph Shattuck, a local real-estate
consultant, "is in total eclipse."
   Much the same could be said for most of the real-estate
sector in Arizona. It's rare for a state to be beset by
simultaneous fiascoes in every cranny of its dominant
real-estate market, but that's precisely what's happening in
Arizona's Valley of the Sun, where Phoenix is situated and
where most of the state's people and empty buildings reside.
Despite almost three years of tumbling real-estate values,
the Phoenix area still has an office-space vacancy rate of
just under 30%, unchanged since 1988. Moreover, the dollar
amount of commercial real-estate foreclosures in Phoenix in
1990's first quarter rose 20% to $2.41 billion, even though
the number of foreclosures declined slightly; this means it's
increasingly the bigger, newer, more expensive office
projects that are failing. In Tucson, the commercial vacancy
rate also hovers at about 30%.
   Apartment vacancies have eased recently, but that's mainly
because construction of new units has virtually ceased. Whole
shopping centers stand vacant, and more are still being
built. And alarmingly, single-family-home foreclosures, which
were relatively low through the early stages of the collapse
before soaring late last year, remain high -- 8,074 through
June 30, compared with 7,832 a year earlier. Prices of some
homes have plummeted as much as 35% in the past 12 months and
60% in the past three years.
   Curiously, the disaster is largely confined to the
funnel-shaped Valley of the Sun, which stretches for 100
miles between ranges of rough desert mountains, Phoenix at
its heart. Other cities such as Flagstaff, Sedona and
Bullhead City never saw the frenzied building that the Valley
of the Sun did and have been plodding along pretty well,
real-estate brokers say. Furthermore, the Arizona economy
outside the real-estate sector is still relatively buoyant;
Arizona State University's Center for Business Research
expects the state's economy as a whole to grow about 3.1%
this year, despite little action in the construction and
housing sectors. And population growth continues to run about
2%, well above the national average; when Texas tanked a few
years back, it was actually losing population.
   Still, two-thirds of the state's 3.5 million people live
in the Valley of the Sun, and 2% population growth is not
nearly enough to make much of a dent in the vast overhang of
empty buildings and raw land weighing on the market. Indeed,
half-finished or barely started projects were based on the
belief that population growth would average 7% annually well
into the mid-1990s.
   So the impact of the bust, at least in the valley, spreads
far beyond just real estate. Small businesses are dropping
like flies. Four years ago, Eddie Alvaro's auto-repair
business earned him about $187,000. He moved his family into
a four-bedroom house in a tony North Phoenix neighborhood.
Last year, the business lost about $10,000. In May, the
business closed. "I used to have BMWs and Mercedes all over
my lot, and I used to live good," Mr. Alvaro recounts,
sitting in the public library with a newspaper in his lap,
opened up to the classifieds. "Now I'm broke, and I'm looking
for work."
   Mr. Alvaro, 34 years old, fears he may lose his house. "I
remember standing in my back yard, looking at my swimming
pool and thinking, `Man, you've got the American dream,
you've got it made,'" he says, shaking his head. "It amazes
me that I'm even sitting here in this place, just another guy
scratching around for a job."
   Jobs aren't as plentiful as they once were, but some
places are hiring. The federal bankruptcy court, for example,
has tripled its staff in the past three years and expects to
hire more to deal with a caseload that has grown from 11,467
filings in 1987 to 16,278 in 1989. Through June of this year,
filings are running 18% ahead of last year's pace. Chapter 11
filings -- filings made by businesses -- have exploded,
running 59% ahead of last June's level.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. is also hiring, which
underscores what is perhaps the most damaging ripple from the
real-estate bust: the demolition of the state's lending
industry. Seven of the state's 10 savings and loans --
representing about $17 billion of the Arizona thrift
industry's $23.5 billion of assets -- are in the hands of the
RTC, the government agency set up to deal with dead thrifts.
They include some of the nation's biggest and most outlandish
failures, such as Western Savings &amp; Loan, which catapulted
huge chunks of money into some of the most remote corners of
the Arizona desert (Sun Valley, for example), acting as both
lender and developer on resorts, trailer parks, housing
developments, malls and about any other project that came its
way. The official estimated taxpayer tab: $1.7 billion. The
unofficial estimate from local real-estate professionals
familiar with Western: $2 billion to $3 billion, maybe more.
   Many of the state's banks are fading or gone, too. And
neither banks nor thrifts are making loans: Total thrift
loans declined by $851.5 million between last Dec. 31 and
March 31. Total bank loans declined by $283.1 million. C.W.
Jackson, a Tempe businessman with interests in real estate
and banking, estimates that the government either controls or
soon will control some $27 billion of the state's $65 billion
in banking assets. "It is my opinion that in coming years, in
Arizona and the country as a whole, bureacrats at the
regulatory agencies will have more influence on the economy
than the Federal Reserve Board," Mr. Jackson says. "That
scares the hell out of me."
   Arizona, of course, has had more busts over the years than
a bad blackjack player. In a sense, the state's whole history
is defined by people's up-and-down efforts to develop livable
-- or at least salable -- real estate out of places that are
naturally hospitable only to cactus and Gila monsters.
   The state was largely the domain of scattered bands of
Apaches and Pimas until well after 1848, when the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican War and awarded Mexico's
vast holdings in today's southwest to the United States.
Modest booms came and went until World War II, when war
production -- and government fears about having defense
contractors located on the West Coast, near waters where
Japanese aircraft carriers might someday lurk -- triggered a
huge defense, manufacturing and housing boom that only
accelerated when the boys came marching home.
   That boom was marked by the kind of can-do boosterism that
Arizona's movers and shakers still pride themselves on. At
one point in the 1950s, for example, Sperry Rand Corp. had
given up on a plan to move a big plant to a desert site near
Phoenix because all the water wells its engineers had dug
came up dry. But John Jacobs, then chairman of Arizona Public
Service Corp., arranged for a noted local water witch to turn
his forked stick on the site; as the story is told here, Mr.
Jacobs had a well sunk at the spot marked by the old man and
his stick, water was struck, and Sperry Rand moved in. The
postwar boom busted in the 1960s, picked up again in the late
1970s, busted again in the early 1980s.
   All the past blowouts featured some of the same suspects
that have figured in the present one: greed, incompetence
and, of course, fraud. Arizona has produced some of the
nation's most memorable swindlers. James Addison Reavis, for
one. A real-estate developer and forgery expert who got
himself out of the Civil War by faking discharge documents,
Mr. Reavis by the 1890s had amassed landholdings totaling
some 12 million acres in Arizona and New Mexico. He claimed
them under old Spanish and Mexican land grants issued to the
Peralta family, whose descendants, he said, had bequeathed
the land to him. He took to calling himself the Baron de
Peralta y Cordova, married a woman after convincing her she
was the long-lost daughter of the Peralta patriarch,
hobnobbed with U.S. senators and even sued the government
when he felt it was interfering with his operations. Only
years later did it become clear that the baron had in fact
invented the Peralta family and forged the land grants --
even going so far as to travel to Mexico City and Madrid to
create a convincing but utterly phony record of the Peralta
family tree. In 1895, he was convicted of land fraud.
   By the mid-1960s, Arizona had been christened the "Land
Fraud Capital of the World" by the popular press for its
abundant scams, many of the variety perpetrated by Dory
Auerbach, the promoter of an alleged paradise he called Lake
Mead Rancheros. Mr. Auerbach blanketed the country with
newspaper ads trumpeting its virtues: "A new community,
coming to life. . . . You can own a king-sized Western estate
with roads and electricty, water and phones. . . . Build now
and move in]" He neglected to mention that the nearest power
and phone lines were six miles away or that the only water
source -- a pipe that jutted out of the desert floor and
operated only when a quarter was deposited -- was 12 miles
away. Mr. Auerbach sucked in millions of dollars before being
convicted of 22 counts of land fraud.
   Some Arizonans find a pattern here, as if it is Arizona's
destiny to skid from one land bust to the next, with
intermittent periods of high rolling and low crime. Partly
the reason is economic: Land is one of the only things that
Arizona has plenty of to peddle. But Marshall Trimble, a
writer and professor of history who has lived here all his 50
years, sees something deeper at work.
   "It is part of that old notion that the West is always a
cornucopia, that every man is a law unto himself, opportunity
awaits those who dare and there is no end to the good times,"
Mr. Trimble says. "That draws a lot of good people." He
pauses, then adds: "It draws a lot of con men, too." It is
also why this bust isn't likely to be the last, he and others
opine. "The only thing we ever learn from these slides is
different variations on the deals, different kinds of
swindles," Mr. Trimble remarks. "There will be future booms
and future busts."
   Still, this bust is distinct in Arizona history, in ways
that mean the state will probably stay busted for years. It's
bigger, for one thing. In Phoenix, despite three years of
slowing construction, there is still about a seven-year
supply of empty office space. More is on the way: Arizona
Public Service and a few other big companies still have
sizable office complexes under construction that will add
millions of square feet of uninhabited chrome and glass to
the skyline.
   As a consequence, commercial real-estate values are still
sliding. A case in point: The RTC recently sold Western's
office tower in Mesa, east of Phoenix, for $20.8 million.
Western had acquired the building, a bizarre-looking affair
featuring blue neon stripes, for $55 million in 1987 from its
developer, Conley Wolfswinkel. Mr. Wolfswinkel, a 350-pounder
who is one of valley's most prominent landowners, once owed
Western about $150 million, but sold Western the building and
several other properties in a complex transaction that was
supposed to reduce Western's exposure to Mr. Wolfswinkel.
   The latest bust is also unique because it has taken the
state's financial system down with it. Between that and the
tough stance of federal regulators, there is almost no credit
available for real-estate deals that might help refloat the
market. Signs of a credit crunch are all over Phoenix, some
of the most interesting being the signs and billboards
advertising Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Chase Bank of Arizona
unit. "We're still lending," the signs proclaim. They're part
of a campaign designed to take advantage of public grumbling
about the tightness of credit, especially for home mortgages.
The signs began appearing about two months before Chase
closed its mortgage-banking operations in Arizona.
   Brokers and developers offer more concrete signs of
liquidity problems. "It is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to get any credit," grouses Alan Kennedy,
president of DeHaven Investments Co., a developer
specializing in raw land. He tells of approaching the RTC
with a proposal for buying a $2 million parcel of land; in
the past, Mr. Kennedy would have expected to put 20% to 25%
down and finance the rest over seven years or so. "But the
RTC said no dice, they wanted all cash," Mr. Kennedy says.
"That's unheard of."
   Further proof of the tough new climate: Mr. Kennedy just
got a letter in the mail from the RTC advising him to find a
new mortgage to replace one held on 11 acres of undeveloped
land DeHaven owns. Mr. Kennedy has never missed a payment,
but the mortgage is held by defunct Blue Valley Savings &amp;
Loan of Kansas City. "The RTC is telling me it doesn't want
to be a lender, so go find another one," Mr. Kennedy
complains. "Well, just where am I going to do that? It would
be next to impossible." He adds: "I have no obligation to do
so, and I don't intend to."
   Regulatory heat is closing off other credit avenues.
George Green, a Phoenix real-estate broker, cites the case of
a healthy bank that refused a mortgage on a $100,000 house to
a man making $50,000 a year who was willing to put 20% down.
The reason: Several months before, the man had made a
credit-card payment late. "That loan would have been a
slam-dunk in the old days," Mr. Green says. Mr. Jackson, the
Tempe developer and banker, says regulators made him classify
as a loss a $150,000 loan to man with $10 million of net
worth. The loan was unsecured, but current. "The regulators
have gotten ridiculous," says Mr. Jackson. His bank, Central
Arizona Bank, failed earlier this year.
   With the traditional credit well running dry, the
so-called hard-money crowd is flourishing, a further source
of potential trouble for the real-estate market. These are
private investors with plenty of cash who will make loans --
at witheringly high rates. Mr. Green says one customer,
spurned by banks and other traditional lenders, got financing
at 15 7/8% from a hard-money operator; the rate means that
the customer -- whom Mr. Green describes as "financially
marginal" -- will pay $400 more a month than he would have
with a more traditional lender. "His house is going to be
back on the market very soon," Mr. Green says. "Hard money
distorts the market even more."
   Comments Ed Preston, a Sedona real-estate agent: "There's
an old saying about Arizona: It has more grazing land and
fewer cows than anywhere, more rivers and less water, more
preachers and less religion. Today you might add, more cash
and less credit."
   So the bust goes on, and monuments to real estate gone
wrong spring up everywhere. From a home on a corner of
Camelback Road, down the way from a canyon of new and largely
empty office buildings, a six-foot-tall yellow sign with red
lettering yelps: "MUST SELL] PRICE REDUCED] MAKE OFFER]" It's
a beautiful ranch house, spacious, three bedrooms, swimming
pool, big fireplace. A scrawled sheet of legal paper on the
front door declares mournfully: "Was priced at $595,000.
Reduced to $385,000. Or what do you want to offer TODAY?
Offer a fair deal. Owner is ready." Another sign affixed to a
wall inside the house refers to the $385,000 and pleads: "If
you don't like that give us a fair offer." The house has been
on the market about a year.
   About 30 miles west out in the desert, not far from the
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Happy Trails resort but not close
to much of anything else, Jim Eastham's sand-encrusted Buick
bumps to a halt along a dirt road. "Do you know where 191st
Avenue is supposed to be?" Mr. Eastham asks a passer-by. Mr.
Eastham, who serves foreclosure notices for a living, is
trying to post papers on raw land so far out in the boondocks
that it doesn't seem to appear on any map or even on the
stacks of plats and surveyor's documents piled in Mr.
Eastham's front seat.
   "You gotta wonder about why somebody'd buy this far out,"
says Mr. Eastham, surveying a broiling griddle of scrub and
cactus that stretches out to the horizon. The temperature is
120 degrees. The site is so remote that Mr. Eastham openly
worries about dying if his car breaks down.
   Incidentally, the Happy Trails resort was another Western
S&amp;L project. It's open but unprofitable. The government owns
it now.
   Other lost places loom up out of the waste every so often.
One spectacular one is Estrella, undertaken by Charles
Keating, the owner of failed Lincoln Savings who has been
cast by many as a chief villian in the thrift debacle. Mr.
Keating and his backers have invested an estimated $200
million in this project. Blacktop winds through mountains
studded with tiny placards marking empty lots. Farther in,
mostly empty houses ring lakes with gurgling fountains. Green
gazebos dot the shore. Mr. Keating still believes people by
the thousands will come here someday, but on a recent
afternoon, Estrella was the private preserve of three boys
who were taking a break from raking leaves to swim in the
lakes and an older gentleman hacking uninterestedly at a palm
tree with a machete.
   Sometimes it's impossible not to marvel at the glorious
indifference to the past evident in many of these projects.
Back out in the desert near what was to be Sun Valley, within
sight of the turnoff for the destinationless Sun Valley
Parkway, a single, rusted sign rears up out of the desert
sand, faded lettering just visible. "West Phoenix Estates,"
it says. Close inspection reveals rusted-out lot markers
poking up, almost reclaimed by the desert. The foundations of
roads scraped out of the sand like the ancient Nazcla lines
of Peru stretch toward nothing in particular.
   West Phoenix Estates was the Sun Valley of a different
time, started in the 1970s and quickly abandoned to one of
that era's busts. Kevin Hull, a construction worker who has
lived out in the desert since 1972, remembers the developers
then. "They were just like these Sun Valley guys," he
remarks. "They were going to make everybody rich. You'd think
these people would learn something from experience, but I
guess not."

   Asia Faces Slow Growth, Inflation,
   But Recession Appears Avoidable

   Asian nations face slower economic growth and faster
inflation if Mideast tensions keep world oil prices high and
push the already-sluggish U.S. economy into recession. But
economists say the region, the world's fastest-growing, would
avoid a recession itself because of the momentum of its
expansion and increasing intraregional investment and trade.
   "I don't think we can talk about a recession in Asia,
where the average GDP is growing 4% to 6%," says Nicholas
Kwan, an economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in
Singapore. GDP, or gross domestic product, measures output of
goods and services, minus foreign income.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most economies in the region already were expected to slow
this year, partly because of sluggishness in the U.S., the
biggest buyer of Asian products, and partly because of
capacity constraints after five years of rapid expansion. Mr.
Kwan says rising oil prices could reduce growth rates by half
a percentage point in 1990.
   But economists say the region is less vulnerable to an
oil-price shock now than in the 1970s. For most Asian
countries, oil makes up a smaller component of total imports
and supplies a smaller share of total energy needs.
   The region also is less reliant on the American economy
than a decade ago because exporters have diversified markets
and domestic demand has risen sharply. In addition, Japan has
become an important market and source of investment capital
for the rest of the region.
   "With the outflow of direct foreign investment from Japan
into Southeast Asia over the past five years, intraregional
trade will keep the region going for some time," says C. Suan
Tan, chief resident economist for the Pacific Rim Institute
of Comparative Economic Studies at the University of Hong
Kong.
   Despite its dependence on imported oil, many economists
expect the Japanese economy to fare relatively better than
the U.S. during the next year. Even if an economic slowdown
in Japan leads to reductions in overseas investment,
economists believe that Japanese investments in the region
would be affected less than investments in U.S. and Europe.
   Also, in the oil shocks of the 1970s, Japan and the "Four
Tigers" -- Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan --
showed remarkable agility in shifting gears to meet new
demands. William Overholt, regional strategist for Bankers
Trust Securities (Pacific) Ltd. in Hong Kong, says the
fast-adjusting Asian economies are likely to emerge from
another oil shock with increased market share for their
exports.
   Except for Indonesia, Malaysia, China and Brunei,
Asian-Pacific nations are net oil importers, so higher oil
prices generally mean higher inflation. Central banks are
likely to keep interest rates high to damp inflation.
   As the region's biggest oil exporter, Indonesia could
benefit most from the price increase, unless higher prices
force a recession in the U.S. and hurt Indonesia's exports of
manufactured goods and basic commodities such as rubber.
Before the Mideast crisis, according to Merrill Lynch in
Singapore, Indonesia's 1990 GDP was expected to grow by about
7.2%, the same as in 1989.
   "We like to see the price {of oil} rise, but not in this
manner," says a Trade Ministry official in Jakarta. "It can
cause a recession in the developed countries that will
depress our non-oil exports."
   Hardest-hit by higher oil prices will be the Philippines,
which depends on imported oil for the bulk of its energy
needs. The Philippines also has about 50,000 laborers in Iraq
and Kuwait.
   The Philippine trade gap already is worrisome, reaching
$1.59 billion in May. Inflation is about 13%. Moreover, the
economy was hit hard by a coup attempt in December and a
severe earthquake last month. Before the Mideast crisis, says
Merrill Lynch, the Philippines' 1990 GDP was expected to rise
about 4%, down from 5.6% in 1989. With an oil-price increase
looming, a Manila banker asks, "What more can go wrong?"
   South Korea's trade performance already is deteriorating.
Sluggish export growth and rising imports in the first seven
months pushed the current account into deficit of $1.1
billion, the first deficit since 1985. The current account
measures trade in goods and services, plus certain financial
transfers.
   Korea also stands to lose billions of dollars of overseas
construction income. Korean companies have 13 construction
jobs under way in Iraq and four in Kuwait, with a total value
of $2.51 billion.
   Taiwan's export performance was weak before the Mideast
crisis, and the U.S. is its biggest market. In the first
seven months, total exports fell 0.9% from a year earlier.
"The export outlook of this country isn't very promising this
year," says David Yang, an economist with Taipei's
International Commercial Bank of China.
   Although Hong Kong has diversified its markets during the
past few years, it still sends about 30% of its domestic
exports to the U.S. The slowdown in the U.S. and continuing
economic woes in China -- where much of Hong Kong's
manufacturing base is now located -- already have caused Hong
Kong's exports and growth to slow this year.
   Although an oil exporter, China isn't expected to gain
much from an oil-price increase. Premier Li Peng said this
week that the amount of oil available for export "will
probably fall due to growing domestic demand."

   Many Executives Urge Public Service
   To Fight Worrisome Social Problems
   ----

   NEW YORK -- Senior U.S. executives favor extensive action
by government and business to tackle what they see as
worrisome social problems, according to a poll done for
Seagram &amp; Co.
   The Chivas Regal Report on American Business Leaders found
that 54% of the 251 senior executives surveyed favored
requiring national public service. The executives said that
both men and women should be offered the choice between
military and civilian service. People might then be assigned
to help in public schools, work with the homeless or assist
in hospitals or drug-treatment programs. Many executives said
the Peace Corps could serve as a model.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two-thirds of the executives said companies should
let employees take days off with pay to perform community
service. An average of four days a year was recommended.
   Some 80% of the executives said they would support
additional personal or corporate taxes if the funds could be
targeted at solving specific problems. They were especially
concerned about problems in public schools and about the
federal deficit, even ahead of drugs, health care and the
environment.
   "A lot of people seem to be saying that if we don't deal
with some of these problems it'll lead to a gradual
unraveling of our society," said Nick Tortorello, chairman of
Research &amp; Forecasts Inc., a New York-based polling firm that
conducted the survey.
   The survey also found that 76% of the executives favored
cutting defense spending by an average of 19%, with the
savings going to help finance some of the social problems.
The survey was taken in April, however, and the Middle East
crisis has presumably moderated the interest in cutting
defense spending, at least for the time being.
   The executives expressed concern about the government's
inability to reduce the federal budget deficit and said they
thought the U.S. will suffer from a lack of political
leadership.
   They were generally optimistic about the economy, saying
in April that they didn't expect a recession in the following
12 months. At the same time, they didn't expect unemployment
to decline or inflation to ease.
   In addition, those concerns appear to have been
exacerbated by the Middle East crisis, according to a
supplementary survey that Research &amp; Forecasts did this week
with roughly 100 of the executives. The survey found that 39%
expected to lower their profit projections following the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Some 12% expected to reduce their
borrowing; 10% planned to delay expansion; and 8% predicted a
hiring freeze. Given the smaller sample, the margin for error
in the recent survey is 10 percentage points, compared with
six percentage points in the main study.
   In the April survey, the executives complained about the
Internal Revenue Service even more than might be expected of
people in high tax brackets.
   "Inadequately monitored, administering an overly complex
tax code that its own bureaucracy cannot explain accurately
and clearly, following quasi-legal procedures that appear to
be stacked against the citizen, the agency is seen as unfair,
punitive and inefficient," the Chivas Regal report said.
   The executives generally felt that government involvement
in business affairs would increase, with more states
restricting acquisitions. The survey also found that
executives expected that pension funds would take more seats
on corporate boards, even though the executives felt the
involvement would hinder companies more than it would help
them.

   In Racine, Wis., Fears Grow
   Of Return to the Old Days
   Of Surging Jobless Rates

   RACINE, Wis. -- In this city of 82,000 on Lake Michigan's
shore, memories still linger of the 22% unemployment that
struck here less than a decade ago.
   That's why residents voice growing concern over effects of
sharply higher oil prices, rising interest rates and a
softening economy. "Here we go again," says Joe Mrazek, a
local developer who has been instrumental in rejuvenating
this city's downtown, where big blue "Re-discover Downtown"
banners wave.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In cities across the U.S., residents are beginning to
wonder just how much their economic lives will be affected by
the events in the Mideast and an already fragile economy.
Here and elsewhere, residents, business owners and city
officials haven't taken any bold steps yet to counter what
could be difficult times ahead.
   But they're worried. Mayor Owen Davies, for instance, says
a lot hinges on the continued prosperity of the city's
biggest employer, J.I. Case International. The farm-equipment
maker, a unit of Tenneco Co., employs 3,000 workers locally
and is building its new $100 million headquarters complex
along the bending shores of the Root River here.
   Tax receipts from the company's big project are earmarked
to help restore an economically depressed area of western
Racine. Should Case be unable to complete its five-year
phased project, as planned, "then our growth will be
stymied," says Mr. Davies. He adds: "We've been on a good
roll lately, so we don't think that's going to happen."
   Still, a spokesman for Case, which is enjoying its own
resurgence, acknowledges that "this company, like any other,
is susceptible to the ebb and flow of the economy."
   Racine residents think they're in better shape to weather
a business downturn now than they were a decade ago. A new
$20 million marina and festival hall downtown is bringing in
more tourist dollars. In addition, low housing costs here
have been drawing young families here from Milwaukee, just 25
miles north, and Chicago, 65 miles south.
   The city's strategic location and decreased dependence on
industry "will keep us from going back to where we were,"
contends Jess Levin, president of the Bank of Elmwood. "I'm
not expecting anything like the '80s."
   The real estate market, though, already is slowing. Mr.
Mrazek, who has built two new office buildings, says he is
"very concerned." And the softening market comes as two big
projects near completion: a 72-unit lakefront condominium
project and a separate development of 20 townhomes and 104
condominium units with private boat slips.
   At the showpiece Frank Lloyd Wright-designed headquarters
of S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, fresh recession worries haven't hit
yet. But veteran employees of the privately held
consumer-products giant recall what happened when troubles
hit in the early 1980s. The company froze wages for one year
and trimmed its payroll by about 300 through an
early-retirement program.

   A Positive Paradox
   Of `Bad' S&amp;L Loans

   In differing with a previous article by Martin Feldstein
and my article of June 19 arguing that the S&amp;L bailout should
not be viewed as adding to the current deficit, Herbert Stein
("A Little S&amp;L Budget Honesty, Please," editorial page, June
25) uncharacteristically adds to the widespread confusion.
   Mr. Stein argues that money that the S&amp;Ls "stole" or
"invested in projects that were no good . . . crowded out . .
. productive investment." He suggests that an increase in
taxes or a reduction in government expenditures would bring
about now an increase in compensating investment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But an increase in taxes or a cut in transfer payments
like Social Security, forcing households to spend less, may
well discourage business investment as the need for capacity
to meet consumer demand falters. And cuts in government
expenditures for investment -- in roads, bridges, airports,
research, education and health -- would only compound the
problem for the economy and for business investment as well.
   Mr. Stein is on most questionable ground, though, in
concluding that the S&amp;L losses resulted in less "productive"
investment. Paradoxically, most of the S&amp;L loans resulted in
more, not less, investment. Many homes were financed by
interest rates that were, at least in hindsight, "too low."
But those homes are generally now being lived in. Many office
buildings and shopping centers were built that did not turn
out to be the best investments, but investments they were.
The economy will undoubtedly get considerable use from them
over the years ahead.
   In fact, the S&amp;L fiasco turned out to be akin to a large
investment credit, no worse I might argue than the
direct-investment tax credits that too many advocates of a
free market have been happy to endorse in the past. It may
have drained some resources for more productive investment
from elsewhere, although this should be shown, not asserted.
But it almost certainly brought on more total investment than
we would have had if more prudent policies had held down S&amp;L
deposits and loans.
   In any event though, the bailout now has nothing to do
with current government expenditures. It is and hence should
be viewed as a set of financial transactions to prevent a
significant portion of the money supply -- S&amp;L deposits --
from being wiped out. It is no excuse for raising taxes or,
for that matter, reducing worthwhile government expenditures.

   Guatemalans Chastised for Making Up Their Own Minds

   GUATEMALA CITY -- Guatemala has taken center stage over
other Central American stories because of the emergence of
former de facto military dictator Efrain Rios Montt as a
possible candidate in the November presidential elections.
Reporters and analysts seem particularly eager to point to
this phenomenon as proof that Guatemalans have given up on
democracy. Some even assert the racist argument that perhaps
Guatemalans simply aren't capable of handling democracy.
   What these analysts are ignoring is that the policies that
they themselves have advocated (and very often imposed) in
the name of "democracy" have been neither democratic nor
enriching for any except the few local proxies who mouth what
outsiders want to hear. Now that these proxies have been
exposed as inept in all matters save corruption, the people
want to throw them out and turn to the so-called hard-liners
-- not in a military coup, mind you, but in an open election.
And the "civilized" world is aghast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When Latin American independence was declared, most of our
territories remained under the influence of the motherland
for several decades. This situation would have been justified
for a short period of time until the right concept of a
republic was found and established in each particular
territory. But it so happened that domination lasted for many
decades with disastrous results.
   In these times, foreign hegemony comes from an
unchallenged determination of the First World countries to
impose on Third World nations their own vision of a
democratic system. If we fail to make the passing grade --
that is, if those approved of by the foreign "experts" are
not elected or reelected -- the penalty is applied: media
condemnation followed by isolation.
   Local Christian Democrats and Socialists share a statist
vision of governing and are usually the only candidates for
office acceptable to the outsiders. They are financed by
foreign funds sent by political organizations abroad. This
type of financing -- massive by local standards -- has often
overwhelmed other candidates and determined the final result
of elections. The definition of democracy then boils down to
the single act of electing a leader propped up with foreign
funding. Democracy does not become a process by which men
govern, but a license to do whatever the elected want once
they're in office. And in these circumstances, the road to
power is opened to some of the worst elements in our
societies.
   Illegal activities -- even including drug trafficking and
related activities -- carried out by those in power have
become an everyday problem here. Unfortunately, most of our
legal institutions do not provide a procedure by which an
elected president can be separated from power through a legal
action, except in the event of mental illness. Officials can
mismanage public funds, act irresponsibly or promote a
chaotic situation for the whole nation, but the citizens are
unable to make them accountable. A "Watergate" is not
possible in a country like Guatemala, though much worse
events have taken place during the administration of
Christian Democrat Vinicio Cerezo.
   And all these abuses have taken place at the expense of
the poorest people, in whose interests the "acceptable"
democrats claim to govern. A litany of just some of their
abuses and the consequent results follows:
   -- They stress the importance of paying taxes but evade
their own contribution through an additional stipend called
"confidenciales" (confidential expenditures); money that is
granted without having to justify how it was spent. President
Cerezo received last year the amount of 180 million quetzales
from such an account; in 1988 the amount came to 150 million,
though he recently insisted on local television that a
realistic figure was closer to "just" 100 million quetzales
(equal to about $25 million).
   -- The foreign minister, aside from his salary,
representation expenses and confidenciales, received $1,000
per diem no matter where he spent his working days.
   -- Donations and loans coming from the U.S. government
through the Agency for International Development have been
grossly mishandled. More than $2 million are unacounted for
in funds given by AID, which would have benefited children
severely affected by malnutrition and illnesses.
   -- The quetzal has reached a point of devaluation almost
as low as it was before this government took over. It is now
evident that an artificial stabilization had been achieved
through the assistance provided by the U.S. and some European
governments that support the Christian Democrats in Central
America. Even then, all the external aid and financing have
not been enough to cover up this government's excessive
spending habits. One dollar was worth 3.78 quetzales last
October. Now the value has gone down to 4.35 and is still on
its way down, even though the amount of dollars in
circulation is at its peak this time of the year when payment
of our most important export goods takes place.
   -- The fiscal deficit increased three times from 1985 to
1988, and by 1990 it became the highest in the history of the
country. Per-capita income has dropped in real terms to its
1969 level. According to statistics supplied by Asazgua, the
private association of sugar planters, the price of basic
products consumed by Guatemalans -- black beans, corn and
rice -- has increased more than 500% from 1985 to 1990. That
means most of the population is far poorer that it was
throughout all the years when the government was controlled
by the authoritarian groups that took power by force.
   -- State hospitals, roads and public schools are in ruins
due to the fact that no money has been spent on their
maintenance. Paper is used instead of bandages to wipe away
blood during surgery. People die because they lack the
necessary funds to pay for high-priced medicines, which are
no longer supplied by the government.
   Of course we do have a new class of millionaires -- those
part-time socialists and part-time capitalists who are
pampered by foreign countries no matter what they do and no
matter how destructive they are so long as they talk pretty
and uphold the principle of democracy -- that is, an
election.
   Meanwhile, the voters with their simple rationale think
that the solution will come from an authoritarian president,
who this time might be elected through a democratic process.
They hope that this new president will be given the chance to
work things out with as much international support as the
populist demagogues who have governed the country the past
four and a half years. Can anyone except the most
reality-blind ideologue really blame them?

   Europe is rediscovering the world. That appears to be one
of the lessons of the current blowup in the Persian Gulf.
Yes, Europe is dependent on Gulf oil, but it's worth noting
that the solid support for the Bush initiative against Saddam
Hussein comes just as Western Europe is attempting to unify
its continental market. Its NATO members, for instance, seem
to believe now that the Gulf region is not quite as "out of
area" as they have suggested during past crises.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was in Aspen,
Colorado, in recent days to deliver a long-scheduled speech
about the European future, and what struck us as most
interesting about her thoughts was how appropriate and
relevant they were for the current moment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. Thatcher again laid out her vision for the European
future, but this time without the nationalistic spin of her
famous 1988 speech in Bruges, Belgium. In Bruges, she
emphasized Britain and the importance of national
sovereignty. In Aspen she spoke more about universal
political values.
   Rather than a tightly bound European union, Mrs. Thatcher
would like to see a broad, flexible community of sovereign
nations. The events of the 22 months between Mrs. Thatcher's
major addresses on this subject have strengthened the
plausibility of that vision. Up to now, hyper-Europeanists
have been unable to respond fully to the political changes
occurring on the EC's periphery.
   Norway, Finland and Austria want to join the EC and are
highly qualified candidates. Turkey and Malta want in as
well. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are striving to
shuck off the sackcloth of communism and develop market
economies. EC membership would help. To be sure, the original
concept of European unity envisioned developed economies. The
emerging Middle European democracies are less developed, but
that does not make them less European.
   As the EC bureaucracy has moved toward removal of barriers
to trade and capital flows it has focused on a more ambitious
goal, an ill-defined "political union." This concept has made
it less hospitable toward new entries. The political
unionists argue that they can't allow new memberships to
disrupt the delicate federal architecture designed in
Brussels. But Free Europe is becoming bigger and more diverse
than it was two years ago, and in Aspen, Mrs. Thatcher
worried about what happens to the democratic and economic
stability of nations that are excluded from the single
market.
   If the EC somehow emerges as a true federation, with a
welfare state and extensive social regulations tacked on to
the original single-market framework, then members will
become more reluctant than ever to admit less-developed
nations. Greece and Italy already strain EC redistributionist
coffers. It will be argued that it is too expensive to admit
a Turkey, a Hungary or a Poland. That exclusion could have
severe consequences for political and economic development,
and in the long term, for the security of Europe.
   Most important, Mrs. Thatcher reminded her listeners that
the difficulties of sustaining democracy are too often
underestimated. Democratic and free-market institutions were
exported to Africa in the 1960s, but lie unused. The way to
fortify market structures in the newly free nations of
Eastern Europe is to integrate them with the established
market structures in the West. (That's equally true for the
other developing nations attempting to participate in the
world trading system.) A looser EC that remains primarily a
vehicle for free trade and economic competition wouldn't be
the elite First World club it threatens to become. The bigger
the free-trade zone, the more wealth it creates.
   That Mrs. Thatcher is no longer trying to confront EC
"dirigisme" head-on is testimony to the momentum of European
unification. She has been called a hesitant European. But
perhaps it is now fair to ask: Who is the true European?
   Is it the advocate of political unity who thereby makes it
difficult for the excluded Europeans, such as Turkey, to join
the club? Or is it the espouser of a broader European
Economic Community, who insists on a structure that all
European nations can join?
   It is conventionally said that by standing off to the
side, Mrs. Thatcher has marginalized British influence on EC
affairs. But the activity of the world's nations this week,
as they seek to protect the global economy from an aggressive
marauder, suggests that Mrs. Thatcher is asking the right
questions about the nature of political and economic
structures in an interdependent world.

   ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Sundstrand Corp. said insurance
companies agreed to pay $15 million to settle shareholder
litigation against some current and former officers and
directors of the defense contractor, arising out of its 1988
plea of guilty to defense fraud charges.
   The company couldn't immediately say how much of the $15
million it would receive; plaintiffs' lawyers are seeking a
portion, plus expenses, for bringing the so-called
shareholder derivative actions in federal court in Chicago
and state court in Delaware.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sundstrand paid a then record $115 million to settle the
government's procurement fraud charges. Shareholders in turn
sued officers and directors for the damage to the company.
   "Sundstrand is extremely pleased that this litigation has
been resolved," Harry C. Stonecipher, president and chief
executive officer, said in a news release. "This development
puts the company's past difficulties squarely behind it."
   The settlement, which the officers and directors had to
agree to, didn't call for them to admit any liability, and
they continue to deny having any liability, Sundstrand said.

   Salomon Plans
   Charge to Shrink
   Its Philipp Unit

   NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc. said it will cost as much as $200
million before taxes to shrink its stumbling Philipp Brothers
Inc. commodity unit.
   The charge is likely to be taken this quarter and could
wipe out much of Salomon's third-quarter earnings. It would
be Salomon's largest charge against earnings since it went
public in 1981, and would represent the latest in a string of
big restructuring hits taken by Wall Street securities firms
in the past year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Salomon, as previously reported, plans to sharply cut back
the scope of Philipp Brothers, which late last month posted a
pretax loss of $62 million -- its sixth consecutive quarterly
deficit. Through June, the unit has had $83 million in losses
this year.
   In a brief news release, Salomon said it started a program
for "a major downsizing and repositioning" of Philipp,
stemming from "prolonged difficult market conditions and
trading losses." The firm declined to elaborate.
   But people familiar with Philipp Brothers' plans say it
will get out of agricultural and non-ferrous metals trading
altogether, and shift its precious-metals trading to its
Phibro Energy Inc. unit. For the past several years, Salomon
has cut back to trading only a handful of commodities from
approximately 150 previously.
   Shifting the residue of Philipp would mark a full circle
for the struggling commodities unit: Philipp Brothers
initially was part of Phibro Corp., which acquired Salomon
Brothers in 1981. Today, Salomon Brothers is the securities
unit of Salomon Inc.
   Salomon said Ernst Weil, Phibro Energy chairman and a
Salomon director, will oversee the Philipp "downsizing."
Phibro Energy is Salomon's profitable oil trading and
refining unit.
   Analysts expect Salomon to pare the unit and take the
charge this quarter. "It's like appendicitis," said Perrin
Long, senior securities analyst for Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. "You have it operated on as soon as
possible. You might as well take your hit at once."
   Citing the firm's earlier exit from the institutional
municipal bond business and commercial paper operations, Mr.
Long said: "Salomon doesn't like to carry losing operations
indefinitely."
   There's another good reason for taking the charge in the
current quarter: Salomon's Phibro Energy unit is probably
making a bundle on the recent surge in oil prices, traders
and analysts say. That will make any charge less painful and
less obvious.
   Traders say Philipp already has begun liquidating
positions in some commodities, including sugar and cocoa
futures. That's helped fuel declines in those commodities in
recent weeks, they say.
   Philipp recently has stumbled in a variety of commodities.
Last year, the firm took big hits in cocoa trading. The 1990
first quarter loss stemmed from trading in non-ferrous
metals, a group that includes copper, aluminum, nickel, tin
and zinc. In the second quarter, the losses came from
agricultural commodities.

   NEW YORK -- The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and countermoves
by U.S. forces have sparked sharply higher ratings for the
three major networks' nightly newscasts -- so much so that
the news ratings may surpass the networks' prime-time
entertainment fare.
   Since the conflict in the Middle East intensified earlier
this week with the deployment of U.S. troops, the combined
ratings -- provided by A.C. Nielsen Co., a unit of Dun &amp;
Bradstreet Corp. -- for the evening newscasts on ABC, CBS and
NBC are up 15% from the previous two weeks, according to
David F. Poltrack, a CBS Inc. senior vice president.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the trend -- and the conflict -- continues, next week's
combined ratings for the three newscasts may exceed the
ratings of prime-time shows. "If it happens, it would be the
first time," Mr. Poltrack said.
   Individually, the "CBS Evening News with Dan Rather" was
up 22% in ratings, "ABC World News Tonight with Peter
Jennings" increased its audience by 16% in ratings, and
ratings for "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw" rose by 8%
from two weeks ago, Mr. Poltrack says.
   The Iraq story also has boosted the ratings of the 24-hour
news channel Cable News Network, owned by Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. CNN nearly doubled its ratings, attracting 1.5%
of all cable homes on Wednesday, the cable channel's highest
24-hour average this year. CNN typically gets a rating of
0.6% of cable homes.
   For the broadcast networks, ratings for the nightly news
aired at 6:30 p.m. or 7 p.m. EDT usually dip in the summer as
viewers go on vacation or stay out later to enjoy the extra
hours of daylight. The three broadcast-network newscasts had
a combined rating of 30.8% of all television homes for the
1988-89 season. But that number dropped 20% in July to a
combined 24.7 rating. A ratings point represents 1% of all
television households or 921,000 homes.
   While the Iraq invasion has been good news for network
news, it could deflate the networks' aggressive programming
strategy used in prime time this summer. Instead of airing
the typical parade of series reruns because of low summer
viewing, the networks have been running more original
episodes in a bid for higher ratings -- yet now their nightly
newscasts could draw even bigger audiences.
   To date, the networks are stymied in efforts to cover the
Middle East story with correspondents and camera crews. CBS
News anchor Dan Rather continues to report from Jordan,
cutting short a vacation in the south of France last week
with "CBS Evening News" executive producer Tom Bettag. Both
men flew to London when Iraq first invaded Kuwait.
   ABC's "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel flew to Cairo, as did
NBC's "Meet the Press" anchor Garrick Utley. Both networks
decided against sending their lead anchors to the Middle East
because officials believed the newsmen were better equipped
to monitor events from New York.

   WASHINGTON -- The 247 insolvent savings and loan
associations in line to be sold or liquidated by the
government posted losses totaling $2.3 billion for the second
quarter.
   The financial results of the insolvent S&amp;Ls are the first
to be disclosed by the Resolution Trust Corp., the savings
and loan bailout agency created a year ago. Previously the
results of the entire thrift industry, with no separate
earnings figures for the insolvent ones, were announced by
the Office of Thrift Supervision.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The second-quarter results compare with first-quarter
losses of $3.1 billion for 350 sick S&amp;Ls under government
control, the RTC said yesterday. In the last quarter of 1989,
roughly the same number of institutions reported losses of
$6.4 billion.
   Federal regulators now have divided the financial
reporting process between the RTC and the Office of Thrift
Supervision, contending that the financial results of sick
thrifts drag down the figures for the rest of the industry.
The 2,500 S&amp;Ls not under government control posted
first-quarter losses of $271 million. They have yet to report
second-quarter results.
   The bifurcation is another sign that the thrift cleanup is
a bigger undertaking than Congress or the administration
conceived of a year ago. The RTC was originally envisioned as
a brief stop for thrifts before they were quickly sold. But
some thrifts have been held and managed by the agency for the
entire year.
   A substantial portion of the losses, regulators said,
consisted of recognizing prior losses not previously
reflected on the S&amp;Ls' books. Second-quarter losses included
$1.3 billion in asset write-downs, compared with $1.8 billion
in the first quarter.
   "To a large degree, these charges result from the RTC's
ongoing efforts to reflect more accurately asset values of
conservatorship institutions," said William Seidman, chairman
of the RTC.
   But it is misleading to discuss improvements in the
results of seized thrifts, industry analysts say, as
institutions file in and out of the agency. "These are just
part of the cost of warehousing these institutions until they
can finally be sold off," says Bert Ely, an S&amp;L consultant in
Alexandria, Va. "We won't know the final losses until they
are sold."

   NEW YORK -- Even before the dust settles from Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, some aggressive money managers are
picking through the rubble of the stock market.
   A lot of fund managers right now are loading up on the
same growth and technology shares they bid up earlier in the
year -- at prices 15% to 20% below their 1990 peak in
mid-July.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You're getting a second look" at some good companies,
says Ray Hirsch, a fund manager at IDS Financial Services.
Earlier this week, he added to his funds' holdings in
high-tech companies such as Autodesk Inc.; Novell Inc.;
Sensormatic Electronics Corp., which helps retailers beat
thieves, and several health-care issues.
   Skeptics still abound. They see the specter of war,
ratcheting oil prices, recession and bear markets marching
through the U.S. In coming months, they say, even good stocks
might only get cheaper.
   New York money manager Graham Tanaka of Tanaka Capital has
been adding to his holdings of chip maker Intel Corp.,
Federal National Mortgage Association and Humana Inc., a
hospital company. He's paying prices that are 12 times or
less the companies' projected earnings for 1991. Before the
sell-off, such stocks traded at price-earnings multiples of
14 or 15 and were getting ahead of themselves, he says.
   Because of investors' "war mentality" and the panic
sell-off that followed last week's eruption of the Mideast
crisis, Mr. Tanaka says, many good stocks are being unjustly
clobbered.
   Currently, investors seem to buy and sell stocks more on a
gut feeling -- aversion or enthusiasm -- than on
fundamentals, some analysts say. As the accompanying chart
shows, Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates in New York has a
shopping list for bargain-hunters that takes psychology into
account.
   Mr. Birinyi's list of promising stocks includes Household
International Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co., waste handler Browning
Ferris Industries Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., General Motors
Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and
financial-services company Primerica Corp. Since the market
peaked on July 17, these stocks all have fallen 15% or more.
   For a stock to qualify for Mr. Birinyi's list, it's not
enough for it to have sold off sharply; before the sell-off,
the stock must have attracted enthusiastic buyers.
   Mr. Birinyi gauges how investors feel about a stock by
counting how many trades in that stock are made on "upticks,"
or price gains from the previous trade, as opposed to
downticks. After a panic, such bullish sentiment about the
stock usually revives, he says.
   Mr. Birinyi's favorite stocks exclude many ostensible
bargains that have recently been battered, such as Toys `R'
Us Inc., Limited Inc., Home Depot Inc. and Time Warner Inc.
"They aren't compelling because they didn't have good buying
patterns" before the market tumbled, he says.
   A few investment strategists, such as Morgan Stanley's
Byron Wien, say the time is approaching when it might be
worth gambling on cyclical companies such as banks, airlines,
papers and chemicals. "I'm not ready to buy these groups yet,
but they're the next wave," says Mr. Wien.
   After the Iraqi invasion, Mr. Wien adds, "the market was
showing climactic behavior (huge price declines and heavy
trading volume) that looked like a bottom." So, this week,
Mr. Wien began recommending United Telecommunications Inc.,
MCI Communications Corp., Intel, Walt Disney Co., Toys `R' Us
and Primerica. The stocks were recently knocked down to
"distressed" levels and probably won't fall much even if the
market goes to 2400, he says.
   However, if there's a prolonged war in the Middle East, or
a bad recession, Mr. Wien says, all bets are off and even
distressed stocks might have a long way to fall. And Mr.
Hirsch of IDS says that if there's a recession, "I may
reverse some of my aggressive investments" in growth stocks.
   Of course, many aggressive investors are playing the
Mideast panic by chasing energy issues. These are mostly
pretty expensive, but a lot of people like to buy stocks that
are going up -- they have "momentum," in Wall Street jargon.
   According to Mr. Birinyi, energy stocks with good buying
patterns are Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp., and two big oil
service companies, Schlumberger Ltd. and Halliburton Co. He
says buying has been "uneven" in Texaco Inc., Unocal Corp.,
Kerr-McGee Corp. and Amoco Corp.
   Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland, a New York brokerage firm,
thinks the real bargains for long-term investors in energy
are certain oil refiners. The stocks have been killed lately,
because of rising prices for the oil they must buy to refine.
But Mr. Gaines thinks refiners that sell much of their
product in the "wholesale" market, such as Diamond Shamrock
R&amp;M Inc. and Horsham Corp., will find their industrial
customers more willing to accept price increases than
motorists are. Mr. Gaines has owned refining stocks for some
time, and thinks Tosco Corp. "might be interesting" a bit
below current levels.
   A lot of usually bold investors are staying on the
sidelines.
   "This isn't the time to be a hero," says New York money
manager Martin Sass of M.D. Sass Investors Services.
   After the 1987 crash, Mr. Sass jumped right back into the
market, but this time he is much gloomier about the economy.
He has been selling copper stocks, he says, and "dramatically
lightening up on airlines, which have a double negative" --
they're facing much higher fuel prices and usually have far
fewer passengers when the economy turns down.
   First Boston analyst Carmine Grigoli warns against the
"fatal attraction" of seemingly cheap stocks. For instance,
many bank stocks are at rock-bottom prices and offer huge
dividend yields, and have attracted buying from such famous
investors as Laurence Tisch, chairman of CBS Inc.
   But the whole banking industry is under pressure to boost
capital, so bearish types expect many banks to cut their
dividends to save money. Banks also are dogged by rising
defaults on loans they made in better days. The shareholder
of a bank, Mr. Grigoli says, is "the ultimate creditor;" he's
lowest on the totem pole and is the real owner of the bank's
bad loans and troubled real estate.
   Some traders see signs that bargain shoppers are just
defending their investment portfolios. That is, they're
loading up on stocks they already own, hoping to recover
their losses, but they aren't making new investment decisions
that reflect higher oil prices and other changes in the
economic picture.
   As Tom Gallagher, a senior Oppenheimer &amp; Co. trader, puts
it: "We're seeing a lot of negative selection" of stocks.

   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is
reviewing for possible downgrade about $4.5 billion of
triple-A rated mortgage-backed securities issued by 19
thrifts.
   The review affects only those securities sold at a slight
market discount from par and issued by thrifts that aren't
rated investment grade by Moody's. A total of 33
interest-bearing mortgage-backed bonds and medium-term notes
are affected. Blanton Neill, an assistant vice president in
Moody's structured finance group, said the securities are
mostly held by institutional investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some of the issuing thrifts are insolvent, Ms. Neill said.
She said the ratings service believes there is a possibility
that others may become insolvent. Among the insolvent issuers
are Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association, CenTrust Federal
Savings Bank, Imperial Savings Association and Anchor Savings
Bank FSB, Ms. Neill said.
   Moody's said it is concerned that the federal Resolution
Trust Corp. might change the terms of the securities. In
June, the RTC repudiated the indentures and took early
redemption of $3.8 billion of interest-bearing
mortgage-backed bonds issued by Franklin Savings Association
in Kansas. In that case, Moody's said, investors received the
original discounted price, plus accrued interest through the
payment date, plus a calculated amortization of the discount
from par. Moody's said it's concerned the same thing may
happen to the 33 issues under review.
   Thus the actual payments to Franklin investors were
slightly less than if the RTC, the government's
thrift-bailout agency, had paid the full principal at par,
plus accrued interest, as provided for in the indentures if
the bonds were redeemed early or payments accelerated. Ms.
Neill said the RTC has the authority to repudiate the
indentures, the agreements between issuer and buyer.
   "The question we're focusing on is if the RTC redeems a
bond early, does it pay the same redemption price that the
indenture indicated would be paid in the event of an
aceleration." She added that "nothing in the documents on
which we based the rating indicated the redemptions would be
less than par." Although she said the RTC policy is evolving,
the agency hasn't made an official statement on how it plans
to redeem the securities. But she said its action on the
Franklin Savings securities and other indications "leads us
to believe" that if the RTC redeems other such securities
they will so at a discount to par.

   Saddam Was in Desperate Trouble...

   Behind the facade of confidence, Saddam Hussein's invasion
of Kuwait was the act of a desperate man. After all, even if
Saddam underestimated the international response to his
seizure of Kuwait, the act could not have been risk-free. Why
take that risk?
   Saddam has big problems at home. The Iraqi population did
not feel victorious in its war with Iran, which concluded two
years ago. To be sure, people were giddy and elated with the
war's end. But as time passed and they looked to their peace
dividend, they didn't find much.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There was no prosperity. Even the limited demobilization
of Iraq's million-man army brought significant unemployment.
Egyptians working in Iraq were murdered for their jobs.
Iraq's immense foreign debt continued to rise after the
cease-fire, by $10 billion to its current $80 billion or so.
In the same period, the Iraqi dinar fell 25% and is now worth
one-twelfth its official value ($3). Inflation runs more than
40% annually. Last year public-sector employees, the bulk of
the labor force, received their first pay hike since the war
began -- 20%. The rank-and-file of the ruling Baath Party
grumbled along with everyone else.
   The war also created pressures for popular participation
in government, and the regime knew it. One month after the
cease-fire, when the population was still elated by the war's
end, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told a visiting delegation
of Arab professors that there would have to be political
change in Iraq or else there would be political turmoil.
Indeed, Saddam was quick to promise the country "more
democracy." He even stuck his toe in the waters of political
reform with fairly honest balloting for Iraq's National
Assembly, although among carefully screened candidates. In
the March 1989 elections the Baath Party won only 40% of the
seats.
   But nothing else happened. As one Iraqi explained to me in
Baghdad last July, "You Westerners think everything is under
control. But you don't see beneath the surface. People are
fed up. The regime fears an explosion."
   The explosion came at year's end -- in Eastern Europe. The
overthrow of one-party regimes there seems to have convinced
Saddam that his position was untenable. In late January the
Iraqi regime made its only significant gesture to popular
expectations by lifting a wartime travel ban -- adding,
incidentally, to the hard currency crunch.
   Saddam apparently came to realize that he needed cash in a
big way -- as an end in itself and for the support it buys.
In February, he struck out on a new course. Publicly he began
raising the old demons, "Zionism" and "imperialism."
Privately, he made exorbitant demands for money. When the
leaders of Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen met for an Arab
Cooperation Council summit, Saddam called for the liberation
of Jerusalem (about which he had previously been silent) and
for U.S. ships to leave the Persian Gulf.
   But his real agenda emerged behind closed doors, where he
dismissed as insufficient the notion that the Gulf states
might forgive their wartime loans to Iraq. He warned Jordan's
King Hussein and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak "Go and tell
those people in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, I need $30 billion
in fresh money. If they don't give it to me, I will know how
to get it." Last month, as an Iraqi envoy toured the Gulf
ostensibly to press adherence to OPEC quotas, he demanded $10
billion from each state he visited. Kuwait offered several
billion.
   In retrospect, many of the dramatic events surrounding
Iraq since February, including Saddam's execution of the
London-based journalist Farzad Bazoft and the threat to burn
half of Israel, can be seen as an effort to raise tensions
with the West in order to create the environment in which to
intimidate the Gulf states into paying up. And when that
failed, to take what was not given.
   The first flush of victory in Kuwait may have alleviated
temporarily many of Saddam's problems. An idle army is busy
again and unemployment has disappeared. Above all, there is
now an answer to the question -- what did we get out of the
war with Iran? Kuwait. The conquest of Kuwait represents the
realization of longstanding and widely held irredentist
ambitions among the Iraqi population. And there is private
profit as well. The army has engaged in widespread looting --
of banks, the money exchanges, the gold market, the car
dealers.
   But sobriety is likely to set in quickly. The United
Nations sanctions essentially prohibit all international
trade with Iraq, including foodstuffs. Iraq spends $4 billion
a year on food imports, relying heavily on them for meat and
its two staple foods, wheat and rice. Supplies were already
spotty before sanctions existed.
   Iraq's generals cannot view lightly the prospect of war
with the U.S. Tension has always existed between them and
Saddam. The cease-fire increased the opportunities for idle
and dissatisfied officers to move against him. Between
December 1988 and March 1989, hundreds of officers were
arrested and many executed. (There have been reports that 100
officers were executed last week after refusing to
participate in the Kuwaiti invasion.) Iraq's most celebrated
war hero, Lt. Gen. Maher Abdul Rashid, disappeared from
public view. Saddam's failure to hold the January 1989 Army
Day parade, remarkable in light of his claim to have achieved
a military victory over Iran, gave credence to reports of
widespread plotting against him. Since the beginning of this
year, there have been no less than four credible reports of
coup and assassination attempts. Last month Saddam closed
down the officers' clubs.
   Iraq's government is essentially a family affair and army
politics became bizarrely entwined with family politics with
the death last year of longtime Defense Minister Adnan
Khayrallah. Saddam's cousin, and the brother of his wife,
Khayrallah was killed in a May 1989 helicopter crash. Reports
emerged of strains between Saddam and his wife's relatives,
including Khayrallah, after Saddam took a second wife.
Saddam's eldest son by his first wife bludgeoned to death a
bodyguard deemed responsible for introducing Saddam to his
new bride. Significant segments of the army blame Saddam for
the death of Khayrallah and resent the executions of the
officers.
   Problems exist elsewhere in the repressive apparatus that
keeps the regime in power. At the end of last year --
coincident with the overthrow of the East European
governments -- Saddam brought two of his half-brothers back
into key security positions. One brother, Sabawi Ibrahim, was
made head of the Mukhabarat, the General Intelligence
Directorate, and another, Wathban Ibrahim, was put in charge
of internal security.
   All this reflects the precariousness of Saddam's position.
His vulnerability to international sanctions, vigorously
monitored, should not be underestimated. But what happens
when those sanctions begin to bite? The very effectiveness of
the sanctions may lead to conflict.
   Saddam is unlikely to go quietly. If he withdraws from
Kuwait, he will be even more vulnerable domestically than
before the invasion; he would be unlikely to survive. As he
comes to realize the dangers sanctions pose for him, he may
respond by taking action aimed at reversing them. He will
probably be calculating and rational, but unrestrained by any
moral scruple.
   Hints have already emerged. Besides those foreigners that
Iraqi forces have taken from Kuwait to Baghdad, the entire
non-Iraqi population of Kuwait and Iraq are potential
hostages. Not only are they subject to the same abuses we
have witnessed in other hostage situations, those in Kuwait
are vulnerable en masse. For example, as Iraqi supplies
become tight, Kuwait may be denied food and water. Will
sanctions survive if the lives of hundreds of thousands of
people in Kuwait, mostly non-Americans, are at risk? Is the
U.S. prepared to fight on their account?
   Or Saddam may look further afield. He probably does not
want a real war with Israel. But what about a phony war?
Israel has repeatedly warned that the entry of Iraqi troops
into Jordan is a "casus belli." The Iraqi army has 50
divisions. Suppose Saddam took 10 divisions and marched them
westward, calculating that Jordan would be unable to stop
him. Israel would have to attack the Iraqi forces. Saddam
wouldn't mind the loss of his 10 divisions if he succeeded in
securing the war that would rally Arab support to his side.
Is there sufficient coordination between Israel and the U.S.
to ensure that Saddam will not profit from such an action?
   Saddam faces real dangers if he withdraws from Kuwait and
the temptation for schemes like these are great. Perhaps it
would be best to let him know now that any brutalities he may
contemplate aimed at undoing the sanctions will bring a
full-scale war. Only such a perception may cause him to
consider that it is better to go back home and take his
chances with the byzantine world of Iraqi politics than to
run the risk of war with the U.S.

   George Bush --
   A Good Man
   On a Tiger Shoot

   When George Bush became president, he replaced portraits
of Calvin Coolidge and William Howard Taft in the White House
Cabinet Room with one of Theodore Roosevelt. Sometime later
he ad-libbed, in his typically goofy way, "Maybe I'll turn
out to be a Teddy Roosevelt."
   This week that doesn't sound so goofy. Toward Iraq, Mr.
Bush has literally spoken softly but wielded a big stick. The
"pastel president" (in one writer's cutting phrase) has acted
in primary colors. The man who only a week ago seemed a patsy
for Congress this week successfully orchestrates the biggest
military-diplomatic operation since Vietnam. It's clear
Washington still hasn't taken the measure of George Bush.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's easy to underestimate George Bush," says Thomas
Ashley, a Democrat who's known him since Yale. "Because he's
so damn genteel and nice."
   Saddam Hussein has exposed both the genteel and the
competitive Bush, the establishment Connecticut and the
oil-rig Texas Bush. He trusted the word of two Arab
presidents that Iraq wouldn't invade Kuwait, and later
Saddam's word that he was pulling out. When neither turned
out to be true, a fed-up president blurted out on the White
House lawn, "He lied." The reaction wasn't staged, aides
insist.
   Newt Gingrich, the House minority whip and historian,
likes to compare Mr. Bush to Eisenhower. But he's had a hard
time deciding which Ike. The general slowly but methodically
drove Hitler across Europe. The president governed slyly but
gave up the domestic political offensive to Democrats. The
Bush presidency contains elements of both Ikes. Mr. Bush may
lack Ronald Reagan's convictions (low taxes, etc.), says Mr.
Gingrich, but he has as much if not more courage when he can
find the convictions.
   Nor is Mr. Bush one to agonize over decisions. In the
Iraqi case, one senior aide became convinced at the first
National Security Council meeting on the crisis that Mr. Bush
would act to reverse the invasion of Kuwait. "That's when he
really laid it on the table," says the aide. When one adviser
talked about having to adjust to a post-invasion world, Mr.
Bush shot back, what do you mean a post-invasion world?
   "He was snapping off the things to be done," says an
official who was there. "Get `Chapter 7' sanctions going at
the U.N. Call King Fahd. Call Ozal. He had most of it in his
head."
   Much is made of the many heads of state Mr. Bush knows,
but perhaps more should be made of his era. He's probably the
last American president who will have fought in World War II;
the metaphor of Munich is personal. He's also a product of
the era of postwar U.S. global leadership. He may therefore
be the right president for the post-Cold War era -- he knows
the necessity of U.S. leadership but he also has the
personality to persuade more independent allies.
   Mr. Bush also understands executive power, which may be
one reason he's bolder overseas than at home. He knows a
president has more freedom in foreign policy. Mr. Bush likes
to say he did more work in one year as CIA director than in
four years as a Congressman. At this week's cabinet meeting,
he cracked that at least this crisis occurred with Congress
out of session.
   He doesn't mind consulting with Congress, but detests its
micromanagement. As part of the effort to persuade Saudi's
King Fahd to invite U.S. forces, he quickly waived the
Metzenbaum amendment -- a restriction on the sale of the U.S.
jets to the kingdom. He didn't call Sen. Metzenbaum first.
   The paradox is that, with Panama and now Iraq, Mr. Bush
may yet achieve what Ronald Reagan could not -- the
restoration of U.S. consensus on the use of military force.
Support for him this week was nearly unanimous. Even Jesse
Jackson said Saddam had to go. While Saddam's ruthlessness
and the lack of Soviet opposition explain part of that
unanimity, Mr. Bush's personal method may as well.
   Some Democrats had felt Mr. Bush's "consultation" was too
perfunctory before the Panama action. This time Mr. Bush had
lunch with House Speaker Thomas Foley on Monday, and called
him again Tuesday morning. Mr. Foley was among the most
supportive Democrats once Mr. Bush dispatched troops.
   The conventional political wisdom now is that Mr. Bush
will have a "rally-round-the-flag" fillip, followed by
trouble if the crisis drags on. Perhaps. But this is wisdom
culled from history (Vietnam) that rarely repeats itself. Mr.
Bush is laying out a doctrine for deterring aggression in a
changed world. In a sense, he's reversing the West's
humiliation in the Mideast with the Suez failure of 1956,
when Eisenhower vetoed the British and French overthrow of
Nasser. Having risked his presidency on Saddam's withdrawal
from Kuwait -- "this will not stand" -- it seems unlikely
he'll settle for stalemate.
   Even in the post-Cold War era, the rest of the world is
still looking for U.S. leadership. (Anybody see Japan or
Germany leading this week?) Whatever the troubles ahead,
George Bush deserves credit for providing it.

   Roger Ach Sees Opportunity for
   Profit In Heavy Industry in Midwest

   CINCINNATI -- If it rusts, Roger W. Ach II wants it.
   For seven years, the company Mr. Ach controls, Chicago
West Pullman Corp., has been scooping up some of America's
more woebegone companies at bargain prices. To some, the
whole idea is folly. But Mr. Ach is gambling that it will
work.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When Mr. Ach had his company buy a largely mothballed
steel operation from USX Corp. for $30 million four years
ago, bankers "thought he was off his rocker," says Drummond
Bell, who represented USX in the negotiations. It took Mr.
Ach seven months to find a lender.
   Mr. Ach, 47 years old, admits that asking for loans is
like "talking into the wind." But he has been helped by
rock-bottom acquisition prices, government aid for ailing
industries, and a captive labor force and weakened unions.
   Since Mr. Ach quit a Wall Street job to start Chicago West
Pullman seven years ago, the company has bought six little
railroads, a hemorrhaging compressed-air products company, a
freight car company and other rusty treasures. Stuck in
Baltimore one night in 1988, Mr. Ach took a ride back to
Cincinnati on fledgling Enterprise Airlines. He liked the
ride so much, he bought that company, too.
   Chicago West Pullman won't disclose its debt level or
earnings, but Mr. Ach says that it is profitable. The company
says it had revenue of $250 million in the year ended June
30, up almost fourfold since 1987.
   Jeffrey Noyce, chief financial officer, says Chicago West
Pullman has borrowed heavily, using banks, venture capital
companies and finance companies. But he says the company is
able to handle the debt, even if there is a recession.
   One of Mr. Ach's current endeavors is a revived attempt to
acquire the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad, a transportation
concern that lost $90 million over the last eight years. Mr.
Ach abandoned his attempt to buy P&amp;LE two years ago when
railroad workers went to court to block the sale. Though the
dispute has been resolved, P&amp;LE now says it doesn't want to
sell.
   Mr. Ach's interest in the Rust Belt is partly nostalgic.
"It's a wonderful city," he says of his native Cincinnati.
Mr. Ach says he never lost faith in the area or its
manufacturing backbone. His office is littered with models of
trains, planes and barges, and a railroad bell.
   Mr. Ach believes there will be a revival of heavy
industry. Citing the area's natural resources and educated
labor supply, he says the Rust Belt will rise above the
slumping coastal economies. His company is getting some help
from the government: Chicago West Pullman received $4.5
million in loans and grants from the state of Ohio for
reopening a plant that had been closed. The company also has
received aid from the state of Illinois.
   Chicago West Pullman also relies on cheap labor. In
reopening plants, the company has leverage over its workers,
whose alternative is often unemployment. The company admits
it hires fewer workers and pays them less than previous
owners had paid. "A lot of guys here are having trouble
keeping their heads above water," says one worker at American
Steel &amp; Wire's Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio, facility.
   The company incurred the wrath of unions last year when an
organizing effort failed at the Cuyahoga facility. "They put
on a campaign against us like you couldn't believe," says an
organizer for the United Steelworkers.
   The company hired a consultant, held meetings and a slide
show for workers, and even held a picnic a few days before
the union vote, at which it distributed profit-sharing
checks. The union complained about the tactics and, in an
agreement with the National Labor Relations Board, the
company said it would refrain from such practices in the
future.
   The company says employees will ultimately make more
through a profit-sharing program. At Vortec Corp., a
Cincinnati air-compression products acquired by Chicago West
Pullman in 1988, some workers are optimistic about
profit-sharing -- but not rich. "Profit sharing, ah, it's all
right," says Stanley Coley, a factory worker. "It's not at
its potential yet."
   The company also encourages, and in some cases requires,
employee-ownership. At American Steel &amp; Wire, which is
51%-owned by Chicago West Pullman, every employee must buy
$100 worth of the stock. Although many employees say they
like the plan, the stock has slumped. In national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, American Steel &amp; Wire
shares closed at $2.50, down from more than $10 a share in
early 1989. At Vortec, a voluntary stock-purchase plan has
had no takers.
   American Steel &amp; Wire posted a net loss of $313,000 for
the nine months ended March 31. AS&amp;W also expects a one-time
charge of $95 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting money
it borrowed to refinance the company and to pay a dividend.
   Still, Mr. Ach says he's in the Rust Belt for the long
haul. "High-tech businesses are wonderful," he says. "But
we're in a more basic business, and we like it."

   No one sensed danger in the Middle East more quickly than
the nation's airlines. At Northwest, the fuel staff went into
a crisis mode the night before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   All that day, they had watched the price volatility on two
computer screens that provide up-to-the-minute price changes.
By 8 p.m., things were looking grim. "We went home that night
saying we may be in big trouble," says R. Jack Van Der Wege,
Northwest's senior director of fuel administration.

   As the second largest industrial user of petroleum
products after trucking, the airline industry's fortunes rise
and fall with oil prices. Because airlines are also
particularly vulnerable to recession, the industry can be
doubly hurt if rising energy prices also lead to an economic
slowdown.
   Helane Becker, airline analyst at Lehman Brothers,
believes the crisis "puts into jeopardy the very survival of
financially weak carriers," such as Pan Am Corp.'s Pan
American World Airways, Eastern Airlines and Trans World
Airlines. Those airlines say they're taking aggressive action
to weather the storm. But it's clear that carriers with older
fleets -- such as Northwest, Pan Am and TWA -- will be hit
hard.
   Some older planes might be parked, and others might be
sold sooner than expected. But the market for the old planes
just got a lot softer, which creates a whole different series
of problems for several carriers, such as UAL Corp.
   TWA and Pan Am were barely hobbling along anyway. NWA
Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, has been stretching to
make debt payments following a leveraged buy-out. The two New
York shuttles -- both up for sale -- were having trouble
finding buyers. And the proposed acquisition of UAL already
appeared in jeopardy.
   All those problems now are worse. Consider Northwest. When
Alfred A. Checchi was negotiating with banks to finance the
buy-out of the company last year, he projected that fuel
prices would average about 70.2 cents a gallon for this year.
But the price has been well above that even before the
crisis.
   Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner has invited the
heads of U.S. airlines to meet with him next week. "I'm
concerned about the effect of rising airline fuel costs both
on the financial position of the industry and on the
traveling public," he told them.
   Airline executives have already been holding emergency
meetings to figure out what to do. Northwest proposed an $8
surcharge on tickets and other airlines said they'd raise
fares by as much as 10%. Yesterday, carriers amended that:
The new plan is to raise fares 5.3% as of next Wednesday.
   TWA is considering budget cuts of up to 25% in some
departments, but owner Carl Icahn says those have been in the
works for some time. America West Airlines is mulling plans
to shelve the purchase of a fifth Boeing 747-200.
   But price increases during a time of lax demand could
create new problems.
   Carriers also are laying plans to re-emphasize fuel-saving
procedures used before when oil prices have skyrocketed.
These include shutting down engines while waiting to take
off, flying slower at cruising altitude, climbing more
quickly to higher altitudes and extending flaps and landing
gear later on descent.
   Airlines buy their jet fuel as they need it, rather than
under long-term contracts. They haven't yet figured out ways
to safely hedge oil purchases in the futures markets. The
result: Price rises have an immediate effect on a carrier's
bottom line.
   "An airline can start out at 8 a.m. with a delivery of
fuel that costs 60 cents a gallon. Then at 10 o'clock, the
refiner can notify them that price per gallon of the delivery
scheduled for the next day is 75 cents," says George James,
president of Airline Economics Inc., an industry consulting
firm.
   And that's exactly what's been happening. Delta Air Lines
says the per gallon price of its fuel has changed by at least
one cent every day since the crisis began last week. Prices
have gone from about 57.8 cents a gallon last month to as
much as 80 cents a gallon this week -- an increase of 38%.
Northwest says it is projecting that fuel may rise to as much
as 86 cents.
   A mere one cent per gallon increase in the price of jet
fuel adds $160 million to the industry's annual expenses.
   Depending upon how long the crisis lasts, airlines also
could face fuel-shortage problems. There have already been
several small crises. Last Friday, Northwest became concerned
about its Hong Kong service after Kuwait Petroleum Corp., one
of two fuel suppliers to the base, informed the carrier that
it would no longer be making deliveries. After several
telephone calls, Northwest was able to get another supplier
to cover the shortfall and Northwest flights out of Hong Kong
won't be affected.
   But says Mr. Van Der Wege, "We're watching the market and
national news reports literally minute-by-minute for
unexpected developments."
   Another difficult task for an international carrier like
Pan Am is keeping its numerous bases world-wide informed of
price changes. Since fuel costs vary from airport to airport,
Pan Am tries to buy as much fuel as possible at the locations
where it's cheapest.
   Traffic has been slow across the industry, and any further
erosion would hurt financially troubled carriers the most.
Eastern is struggling to woo customers back since it filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection in March 1989. Pan
Am and TWA rely on trans-Atlantic business, much of it
discounted travel; because those routes depend heavily on
vacationers, they're unusually sensitive to price increases
and bad economic times.
   "We're on the razor's edge," says Kent Scott, the pilots'
union leader at TWA.
   Midway Airlines, which has been wielding its budget knife
for months, says it will consider a hiring freeze, among
other things, if the fuel situation worsens. "We're sort of
at the mercy of world events," says Alfred Altschul, chief
financial officer at Midway.
   The surge in fuel prices has accelerated the company's
cost-cutting campaign, he says. The day of the Iraqi
invasion, the company's fuel purchasers and revenue managers
huddled late into the evening. "What I did immediately was
reassess the company's expenses. We're looking at whether
we're purchasing efficiently, where our overall head count
stands, what flights we fly -- everything," says Mr.
Altschul.
   Aircraft built in the last decade are 30% more fuel
efficient, on average, than the previous generation's. For
instance, Airbus Industrie's twin-engine A-320 burns 5,200
pounds of jet fuel an hour, while the Boeing 727, which
carries roughly the same number of passengers, burns 6,600
pounds an hour because of its three engines.
   Northwest and TWA both depend heavily on aging DC-9s and
Boeing 727s, while Pan Am has a large fleet of older,
gas-guzzling 747 jumbo jets. TWA doesn't take delivery of
more fuel-efficient Airbus Industrie A-330s until 1995. The
Trump Shuttle also depends largely on an older fleet of
Boeing 727s.
   Ultimately, some of those planes might be parked, along
with some of UAL's McDonnell Douglas DC-8s, which pose the
same cost problem.
   Industry observers also expect to see airlines retire
older, fuel-inefficient planes more quickly than planned.
Early this year, for example, amid high fuel prices, USAir
Group Inc. told Wall Street analysts it had identified about
70 planes as retirement candidates because they cost too much
to run.
   Even before the current crisis, Pan Am was planning to
phase out some of its older 747s in favor of more
fuel-efficient Airbus A-310s and A-300s, which are already
doing a large part of Pan Am's overseas flying. The company
may speed up the phase-out if the fuel crisis worsens.
   At UAL, events in the Middle East promise, at best, to
prolong the company's exhausting employee buy-out effort.
Faced with an Aug. 9 financing deadline, Gerald Greenwald,
head of the buy-out group, was forced to acknowledge to UAL's
board this week that no banks would commit to financing the
$4.38 billion plan with so much uncertainty in the economy.
   The group received a 60-day extension to the deadline in
order to evaluate the crisis and continue working with banks.
But the outlook is far from encouraging. In recent days, UAL
stock has settled at about $101 a share, its lowest level in
years, making it virtually impossible for banks to justify
financing the employees' $201 a share buy-out proposal.
   Although the buy-out group figured a near-term recession
into its five-year business plan for the airline, the group's
advisers say it would have been virtually impossible to
predict such a steep, swift rise in fuel prices. Last year,
United spent $1.35 billion on fuel. The current run-up in
prices could add $150 million to $400 million to that bill,
according to industry analysts.
   The unions were counting on using aircraft sale-leaseback
arrangements to generate cash to pare down their bank debt.
The leasing market has been soft for months. With the jump in
fuel prices, it is unlikely United would be able to get good
enough prices for its planes, especially the older 727s,
737s, and 747s, which make up the bulk of its fleet.
   Northwest also could find itself in a bind. An investor
group led by Mr. Checchi took the airline private last year
in a $3.65 billion buy-out. Northwest still has $1.8 billion
in debt to pay back.
   The airline was counting on selling most of its planes to
leasing companies to generate cash. But the leasing market
nosedived after the airline had sold only 17 of its planes.
   When the crisis broke last week, Northwest pricing and
finance executives spent hours on the phone with refiners and
oil industry analysts, trying to come up with new fuel cost
projections. By Friday, the company was estimating additional
fuel costs of $180 million this year.
   Even with a fare increase, Northwest "will never recover
the money we've lost in just the past few days" from the
price rises, a spokesman says. Passengers have already
purchased 75% of tickets for flights booked in August, and
30% of the tickets for September flights, all at lower,
pre-crisis fares.
   What's more, Northwest can do little to increase its fares
on its Japanese routes, which generate a fifth of its
revenues, since those fares are set by bilateral treaties.
   Analysts who follow the industry now predict that carriers
will lose money this year as a result of the Iraqi invasion.
Until recently, Airline Economics was forecasting a $400
million to $500 million industry profit. Now it projects the
industry will record a deficit of $1 billion, which would be
the largest loss the industry has suffered since deregulation
in 1978.
   A major concern for airlines is whether a fare increase
will do more damage than good. Demand appeared to be
slackening already. The most optimistic estimates project
that traffic will increase a mere 1.5% in the second half of
the year. Ms. Becker, the analyst at Lehman Brothers, says
she believes that the fare increases "might not stick"
because ticket bookings for the rest of the year "don't look
strong."
   Travel agents also are shaking their heads at what could
be steep fare increases. "This won't be well-received.
Everybody is looking for the bottom-line, best deal," says
Ernestine Judkins, an agent at Amarillo Consolidated Travel
in Texas. "They'll just drive or stay home."
   In recent days, some airlines appeared to be using the
threat of higher ticket prices to buoy sagging advance
bookings. Citing fuel price uncertainty, Delta issued a
statement Wednesday urging that "travelers who can confirm
their plans might be well advised to make their reservations
and purchase tickets now."
   Airlines may have slacked off a bit on fuel conservation
efforts in recent years. The elaborate fuel conservation
procedures initiated after the fuel crises of the '70s "got
de-emphasized" as petroleum prices dropped, says Capt. Larry
Rankin, a Pan Am pilot.
   That may change quickly. Northwest flight dispatchers, who
compute the fuel amounts for each flight, are to gather with
Northwest executives over the next few days to devise new
methods of conserving fuel.
   Certain government procedures and an overburdened air
traffic system also haven't been conducive to saving fuel.
Increasingly, the Federal Aviation Administration is forcing
aircraft to fly in holding patterns over airports for longer
periods before they land because there aren't enough
controllers to handle the planes.
   Carriers also used to keep their aircraft parked at the
gate until just before taking off. But the Transportation
Department, in its monthly report card on carriers' ontime
performance, now counts a flight as late if it leaves the
gate more than 15 minutes after its scheduled departure time.
   So crews leave the gate -- only to spend time sitting on
the taxiway with at least one engine running, guzzling fuel.

   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp. reported a widened
second-quarter loss amid mounting debt problems and contract
negotiations with its biggest union.
   The company, which has been struggling to recapitalize its
huge debt load and avoid bankruptcy proceedings, posted a
loss of $27.6 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with a
loss of $4.9 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.
Furthermore, the company missed a $11.6 million preferred
dividend payment. But a proposal to reclassify its preferred
shares into common would eliminate its unpaid preferred
dividends, currently totaling $69.8 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Second-quarter revenue eased to $146 million from $159
million.
   For the six months, Western Union had a loss of $45.7
million, or 81 cents a share, compared with $5.1 million, or
72 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped to $291
million from $317 million.
   The 1989 revenue figures included $4 million for the
second quarter and $8 million for the six months from
services which are no longer provided by Western Union.
   The second-quarter loss was based on a weighted average of
89.1 million shares outstanding versus 44.4 million last
year. The six-month loss was based on a weighted average of
84.9 million shares outstanding versus 43.5 million. The
increase came mainly from conversions of Western Union Class
B convertible preferred shares into common shares during the
past 12 months.
   The company attributed its losses to some $29 million in
quarterly interest payments on $640 million in debt. The
second-quarter loss also included $5.4 million of costs
associated with Western Union's proposed recapitalization
plan. These included legal and printing fees and payments to
its investment advisers, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Moreover, the results included $5.6 million from
settlement of claims relating to the purchase in 1987 of ITT
World Communications Inc., $5 million from termination of a
pension plan, and $6 million of restructuring charges.
   A spokesman said that if the costs and restructuring
charges were eliminated, Western Union would have shown a
$22.2 million profit in the 1990 second quarter compared with
a $9.5 million profit in the like 1989 period.
   "Both of our businesses (business services and financial
services) are operating profitably," the spokesman said. "But
the corporate interest expense is so high that it's
offsetting those profits."
   Meanwhile, Western Union continues to negotiate a new
three-year contract with the Communications Workers of
America, covering about 2,500 workers. The previous contract
expired last Monday.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Western
Union closed at 42 cents a share, up three cents.

   U.S. Challenges Georgia Election System

   The Justice Department, in an action civil-rights
advocates hailed as a landmark lawsuit, asked a federal court
to end Georgia's runoff election system, which requires a
candidate to receive over 50% of the vote to be elected.
   The majority-vote requirement, which is similar to that of
eight other southern states, was adopted in 1964 and
maintained as a means of preventing blacks from being
elected, the Justice Department charged in a suit filed in
Atlanta.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit is the department's first across-the-board
challenge to a state's elections for federal, state and
county positions. The Georgia system, the federal suit
charged, violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 14th
and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. In a separate
pending legal proceeding, the department claims that Georgia
discriminates on racial grounds in the way it elects many of
its judges.
   Perry Michael, Georgia's executive assistant attorney
general, declined to comment on the suit. But he said state
officials were "very surprised" by the action, because a
group of Georgia citizens already had challenged the majority
requirement in a similar suit filed in May.
   The federal suit "is very significant because it shows
that the Justice Department will be much more active than it
had been (under former President Reagan) in trying to stop
discriminatory voting practices," said Robert McDuff, an
attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under
Law, a Washington advocacy group.
   The majority-vote requirement has its most obvious impact
in primaries in which black candidates win the most votes but
don't achieve an outright majority. In subsequent runoff
elections, whites in Georgia typically have voted along
racial lines to defeat black candidates, the Justice
Department charged.
   The Georgia system, said the department's civil-rights
chief, John Dunne, "has denied the state's black citizens an
equal opportunity to participate in the political process."
He said that 26.5% of Georgia's voters are black, according
to 1980 census figures, but only 10% of the state's elected
officials are black.
   Mr. Dunne said news reports at the time the Georgia system
was created had described state legislators' desire to
prevent "Negro bloc voting." That purpose provides "the
smoking gun" in demonstrating the illegal discriminatory
intent behind the majority-vote requirement, Mr. Dunne said.
   The other states with runoff systems similar to Georgia's
are: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. Mr. Dunne said that
the Justice Department isn't aware of discriminatory results
related to the majority-vote requirements in any of these
other states and that it isn't investigating them.
   He added that the department's suit wouldn't affect this
year's gubernatorial election in Georgia. In a Democratic
primary runoff this week, Lt. Gov. Zell Miller beat former
Atlanta mayor and congressman Andrew Young, who had sought to
be the state's first black governor.

   APPEALS COURT RULES Alabama hazardous-waste curbs
unconstitutional.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled
that an Alabama law prohibiting disposal of out-of-state
hazardous waste in Alabama -- unless the state where the
waste was generated has similar facilities -- violates the
commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.
   Under the law, Alabama issued a "blacklist" barring the
acceptance of hazardous waste from 22 states and the District
of Columbia. The law, passed last fall, forced many companies
to ship their hazardous waste to other disposal facilities,
adding significantly to the companies' costs.
   The appeals panel's decision had been closely watched by
the hazardous-waste industry, as well as legislators in other
states considering adopting similar laws. The panel
overturned a ruling by a lower court in January upholding the
constitutionality of the law.
   The case arose from a lawsuit filed by Chemical Waste
Management Inc., which runs the nation's largest and
Alabama's only commercial hazardous-waste management
facility, located in Emelle. The National Solid Wastes
Management Association, a trade association for the
waste-management industry, is also a plaintiff in the case.
   The appeals panel acknowledged that many states are
concerned about minimizing the dangers to public health and
to the environment created by hazardous wastes. But the panel
found that Alabama's law barred the wastes only of certain
states, placing an unfair burden on interstate commerce and
violating the Constitution. In addition, the panel ruled that
Alabama's regulation of hazardous-waste land disposal was
pre-empted by Congress's intention that those decisions be
regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency on a
nationwide basis, in order to insure that certain states do
not become dumping grounds.
   In a prepared statement, Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt said the
state was still looking at the decision but intended to seek
a rehearing or review by the U.S. Supreme Court. He said that
the Alabama law had received "broad support in this country
among the states" and that he felt each state should create
their own hazardous-waste management program.
   But Allen Moore, president of the National Solid Wastes
Management Association, said in a statement that the decision
means that states cannot act on their own to create such
programs.
   "This is not to say that only a few states should satisfy
the nation's hazardous-waste disposal needs. There is a role
for every state, and the federal government must assure that
all states do their part," Mr. Moore said.

   SEC ACCUSES BROKERS and company of teaming up to
manipulate IPO.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Beres
Industries Inc., two of its officers, the president of a
now-defunct brokerage firm and four other individuals of
fraud and stock manipulation.
   In the civil suit, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J.,
the SEC said the scheme began with the over-the-counter
company's initial public offering in June 1986 and ended in
March 1989 when the brokerage firm, Monmouth Investments
Inc., went out of business. Beres' stock, which had traded
between $1 and $4 during the alleged scheme, immediately
collapsed with the closing of Monmouth, the SEC said, and
recently traded as low as six cents a share.
   The individual defendants include Charles Beres Sr., the
founder and chairman of Beres; Charles Beres Jr., chief
executive officer; and Arden Brown, formerly president of
Monmouth, which was based in Englishtown, N.J., before it
closed. Monmouth wasn't named in the lawsuit. Beres, which
makes plastic molds, is based in Lakewood, N.J.
   The SEC charged that Mr. Brown told Beres that Monmouth
would underwrite the initial public offering only if Mr.
Brown was given 10% of the company's stock in addition to its
usual underwriting fees. The SEC charged that this
arrangement was never disclosed to investors.
   Before the initial public offering, there were nine
million restricted Beres shares, mainly held by Beres
insiders, the SEC said. About a third of those shares were
eventually sold to Monmouth for far less than the prevailing
market price, the SEC alleged. Monmouth turned around and
sold the stock at higher prices through misleading
boiler-room techniques, the lawsuit said.
   The SEC said that during the initial stock offering,
Monmouth solicited customers and arranged for later purchases
at preset, arbitrary prices. These arranged sales made it
appear that the stock was in demand after the initial public
offering, the SEC said. The defendants' lawyers couldn't be
reached for comment.
   The SEC is seeking a court order banning the defendants
from securities law violations. It also asked the court to
order them to turn over their allegedly illegal profits,
estimated to total $4.5 million.

   STATE JUDGES begin effort to resolve asbestos litigation.
   Although recent actions by federal judges have put
asbestos personal-injury litigation in the news, the bulk of
the cases are before state courts. Working in conjunction
with some of the federal judges, three state judges from New
York, Baltimore and Philadelphia have begun planning a
conference for this fall at which about a dozen judges from
across the country will meet to discuss the issue.
   Several federal judges are meeting today in Washington to
discuss a possible asbestos personal-injury class action and
other nationwide approaches to resolving the cases. New York
state Justice Helen Freedman of Manhattan said the state
judges plan to focus on alternative ways to encourage the
parties to settle the suits and avoid going to trial.
   Many judges have become frustrated with the growing
backlog of asbestos cases, and some fear that the defendants
may run out of funds before all the claims are paid.
Asbestos, once widely used in shipbuilding and construction,
causes cancer and respiratory ailments.
   Justice Freedman, with 2,000 asbestos cases pending, said
a claims-resolution system needs to be set up to ensure that
the more seriously ill claimants are paid first and to speed
up the compensation process.

   A FEMALE MINISTER charges that she was sexually harassed
by a male pastor.
   In a lawsuit believed to be the first of its kind, the
Rev. Susan E. Black alleges that the Rev. William R. Snyder,
pastor of St. John's Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, made
unwelcome sexual advances toward her during the 15 months she
served as the church's associate minister. She claims Mr.
Snyder described the two of them as being "in love."
   In her suit, filed in Hennepin County District Court, Ms.
Black is also charging Mr. Snyder, the church and its
denomination, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
with violating Minnesota's "whistleblower statute," which
bars organizations from firing employees engaged in a legal
action against those organizations.
   St. John's congregation dismissed Ms. Black in June, two
months after she filed a complaint against Mr. Snyder with
the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.
   In a statement, Bishop David W. Olsen of the
denomination's Minnesota Area Synod denied that church
officials had retaliated against her for filing the
complaint. He said a church committee, which investigated Ms.
Black's charges earlier this year, concluded that Mr.
Snyder's behavior was "extremely inappropriate for
professional relationships," but found no grounds for taking
disciplinary measures against the pastor.
   Karl Cambronne, a lawyer for Mr. Snyder and St. John's,
said he will file a motion to dismiss the suit on First
Amendment grounds. He added, "Factually, (Ms. Black's) claim
is lacking."

   APRIL 9: This is the happiest day of my life. I've been
promoted to our headquarters office in Tulsa]
   Of course, this means selling our house, which we bought
only three years ago. It shouldn't be too difficult. The
market is supposedly a little soft, but I have every
confidence we'll do fine. I believe that people will always
need good housing, which this is. I look forward with a

we've got four full months to get this job done.

   APRIL 16: Our agent, Millie, has told us we have to be
"realistic" and "willing to make concessions." The market is
"very soft," she said. "You bought back in the mid-80s when
the banks were willing to lend money to anyone with a
checkbook and a dark suit, no offense," she said. "Times have
changed."
   I'm tempted to remind her what she told us when we bought
back in '87. "Don't worry about what seems like the
exorbitant asking price," she chirped back then. "You're
putting your money in the best and safest investment there is
-- the future]"
   But I hold my tongue. What's the point? None of this is

   APRIL 23: A few couples looked at the house this week. The
Farbers, who "hate ecru." The Roztonkowskis, who would have
preferred wood chips and gravel to a grass lawn (for easy
maintenance). And two guys who called themselves the Broz
Brothers, who were disappointed to find no gym.
   Three couples in a week] This will be easier than Millie
thinks.
                                                                                                       

   MAY 23: Well, maybe not that easy. One visitor in the past
month: a tall, sinister individual with a fetid white coat
and vertical hair, with a companion who couldn't have been
more than three feet tall. "Ah yes, Fritz," the guy murmured
to his friend as they sat on my daughter's bed, stroking her
Little Mermaid sheets. "This should be a perfect spot for our
experiments]" I kicked them out. How desperate do they think
we are?
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 7: I had Millie call Fritz to see whether he was
still interested. Unfortunately, they just bought a house
down the street.
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 20: At last] A genuine nibble] The Stimmels: a
boorish pair of ferrets in human form, although I have
nothing against them personally. I don't know whether
anything will come of this, but they've been here twice]
After looking over the entire residence, Mrs. Stimmel ("Call
me Dot") stood in thought on the front lawn and said, "Gee,
this would be a halfway decent spread if there was something
jazzing up the view." Eager to please, I asked, "Like what?"
   "Like maybe a lawn gnome or two," Mrs. Stimmel said. No
way, Dot.
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 21: This evening I went to Kropotkin's hardware store
and picked up a brace of three-foot-high gnomes. Man, they're
ugly. When I got home, my wife said to me, "Dot called and
wonders whether it would be possible to do the gnomes in
pink, blue and electric orange." It's 3 a.m. now, and I'm
just finished with the spray painting. I can't write anymore.
I'm too exhausted.
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 24: Dot and Merv came over last night. They like the
gnomes. We're circling the issue of money now. We've priced
ourselves ludicrously low and stand to break just about even
(if you don't count the $50,000 we put into the place over
the last couple of years).
   So Merv sat down in the kitchen and said to me, "How's
about a beer?" I repressed a strong desire to pop the big
rhino in the nose. I gave him the beer and had one myself.
"How's about another?" he said after a time. Seven beers
later, the guy leaned across the table, and I was seriously
concerned that his breath would ignite my favorite T-shirt.
"OK," he blurted. "Let's get down to brass tacks. We've got
80 grand in cash here that's got your name on it."
   I did not know what to make of this. Eighty grand is a
dimple on the face of our asking price] I left the kitchen,
honking and sobbing. "It's my allergy," I told him. "Give me
a moment and I'll be all right."
   Back in the living room, Millie was elated. "You have a
firm offer," she burbled. "If you make a few more minor
concessions, I'm sure they'll be willing to come up quite a
bit]"
   "Will they come up 500%?]" I screamed.
   The Stimmels departed, but not before recommending that if
we really want them to raise their offer, we might consider
making some additional gestures of commitment -- like new
plumbing, new wiring and a Florida room off the back patio.
It's Sunday, so I can't do anything about it today.
                                                                                                       

   JUNE 25: I went down to Toyota and traded in my new MR2.
That should just about cover the remodeling Dot and Merv
suggest.
                                                                                                       

   JULY 15: The remodeling is done, but time is running out.
We have accepted the Stimmels' final offer of $80,006. My
attorney tells me that under the bankruptcy laws, I will
still be allotted enough money to move to Tulsa and make a
new start.
                                                                                                       

   JULY 20: The Stimmels refuse to go to contract until I
hand over all my frequent-flier miles and supply them with a
full year of meat. We agree.
                                                                                                       

   JULY 30: Closing is tomorrow, and the next day we move to
Tulsa. For a while it looked as though we were going to have
to walk, but some of our neighbors took up a collection and
physically restrained the Stimmels from laying hands on it.
   For the past couple of weeks we've been living in a tent
in the back yard, and I've been picking up a few extra
dollars running errands for Dot, bringing Merv a beer when he
needs one. The Stimmels insisted on moving in as soon as the
contracts were signed. "Just to get the feel of the place,"
Merv said. Millie told me such arrangements weren't that
unusual, given the "shifting nature of the marketplace."
                                                                                                       

   AUG. 1: We're on the bus. We're traveling light -- my wife
with her one cloth dress, I with my two suits, one sport
jacket and one pair of slacks. My daughter secreted a Barbie
under her smock, and I believe my son has at least one
Ghostbuster shoved in the waistband of his pants.
                                                                                                       

   AUG. 7: One week later -- and everything's peachy] Tulsa's
a wonderful city, the job's great, and living will be
terrific. My company has given me a small stipend to find
housing. It shouldn't be too tough: The neighborhood we're
looking at has 150 houses -- 70 of which are for sale. We saw
a perfect one today, in fact, owned by a real nice couple
named Willard and Bea. Well, not exactly perfect. It could
use a screened-in porch, perhaps, and a pool. Also, we hate
the color of the trim.
   Anyway, it's all negotiable. In the meantime, I think I'll
go see Willard. Maybe he has a couple of brews in the fridge.

   Reports Profit
   For Its 4th Quarter

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., continuing
to pound its competitors in the computer workstation
business, posted fiscal fourth-quarter net of $49.1 million,
or 51 cents a share. It had a loss of $20.3 million, or 25
cents a share in the year-ago quarter.
   The company's earnings for the quarter ended June 30
exceeded expectations of even the most optimistic analysts
and provided fresh evidence that Sun's grip on the
workstation market is tightening. In recent months, Sun has
outpaced competitors, most notably Hewlett-Packard Co. and
Digital Equipment Corp., with new models that are faster and
less expensive than prior products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue for the fourth quarter was $700.1 million, a 62%
rise from the $431.2 million reported a year ago. "Their star
is rising," said Robert Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp;
Quist.
   For the year, Sun's revenue totaled $2.47 billion, a 40%
increase over its 1989 fiscal year. Net income rose 83% to
$111.2 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with $60.8
million, or 76 cents a share, in the prior year.
   Bill Raduchel, Sun's chief financial officer, attributed
the company's rapid sales growth to new distribution
arrangements that give Sun an entre into commercial and
office markets. Traditionally, the company has sold its
machines to technicians and scientists.
   "We see a broad diversity of firms coming to us and major
industries are buying our systems, it's just not engineers
and scientists anymore," he said.
   Mr. Raduchel cited a recent order by the New Zealand
Inland Revenue Department, which wants Sun machines for an
office automation project.
   Sun's quarterly results amid a slow growth period for
computer sales presents a bright financial picture for
company. It ended the year with $394 million in cash,
compared with $54 million a year ago.
   The fourth-quarter loss posted by Sun a year ago was the
only such loss for the company since it went public in March
1986.

   Letters to the Editor:
   Republicans Should Own Up on the '80s
</HL>

</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11
</SO>
<LP>
   Concerning Peggy Noonan's July 16 editorial-page article,
"Keep The Republican Faith": Miss Noonan is correct -- I and
many of my coevals registered as Republicans in our senior
year of high school because, in 1983, being a Democrat was
passe. She is also right in her assertion that what
Republicans, and Americans, need most right now is Teddy
Roosevelt charging up Spend More Hill to kick some
appropriated butt. However, she goes on to make two more
suggestions (of what the party should be and/or do to "own
the '90s") that are based in a reality other than the one
most of us have been dealing with for the past few (50?)
years.
   First, her depiction of the abortion dilemma is blatantly
misleading. The furor is not the result of a disagreement
over the morality of abortion. I have never met anyone who
likes the idea of sucking a potential human into a vacuum
hose. The issue is whether the federal government has a right
to make the decision for us. The depiction of the thoughtful
couple being gently guided by the right-minded party to a
morally sound decision on child-rearing is, at best,
irrelevant. To many people the choice is this: Try to survive
as a poor, single woman with no education or resume-quality
experience, or try to survive as a poor, single mother with
no education or resume-quality experience.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Second, it seems more than a little revisionist to assert
that Republican arms-mongering has kept the U.S. out of a war
for the past 50 years. Perhaps the history books do not label
them as such, but Korea, Vietnam and Panama were certainly
not tea parties. I wonder how much safer for democracy the
world would be today if we had funneled all the time, energy
and capital invested in the defense industry toward
education, infrastructure and the eradication of hunger from
the face of the planet?

   Miss Noonan, apparently, is not talking to the right
folks. I know many people, myself included, who are 100%
comfortable with their position on abortion and who resent it
enormously when a political party takes it upon itself to
tell them how to think about this most personal issue.
   If Miss Noonan cares to broaden her horizons, I would be
happy to introduce her around.
   Ronit Addis Rose
   Brooklyn, N.Y.
   ---
   Miss Noonan's article was a classic and makes it clear why
she was chosen as a speech writer to help Ronald Reagan and
George Bush in their campaigns. There is a clarity and
sincerity in her writing that is not found in the work of
other political writers.
   She gives a good summary of what has happened to the two
political parties in the past 10 years. The Democrats have
not changed. They are perceived as the tax-and-spend party.
They are not believed to be truly interested in a balanced
budget. They control the big-city machines noted for
corruption and power. They control Congress, and by being
ineffective have the country ready to throw them out.
   The Republicans are strong on defense, are the advocates
of smaller government, lower taxes, prosperity and jobs. They
seem to be more in tune with the voters. Their biggest
problem is the unbalanced budget.
   Miss Noonan outlines a blueprint for continued Republican
success -- stay with their strong points and avoid any
tendency to become like the Democrats. If they proceed in
this manner they can hold on to the executive branch and have
an even chance of taking Congress as well.
   Harold E. Radford
   Aurora, Colo.
   ---
   Miss Noonan tries to write and describe what the
Republicans are, and what they ought to be in the future. Her
litany of cliches such as "along came Reagan and we owned the
'80s . . . {we} became the party of the people, protector of
their interests . . . not only on the side of the guys at the
country club . . . we're on the side of the waiters]" Wait a
minute, Miss Noonan, the legacy of the Reagan Revolution and
the Democratic Congress have left this nation in a shambles
whose free fall into economic and moral decay will take over
this nation like an avalanche.
   There has been no difference in the parties as she
describes. Their one interest is in getting re-elected and to
do it whichever way works. Any kind of three-minute TV
commercial that arouses primal carnal revulsion and a neglect
of the principal issues facing our nation is used. The
Republicans are no more on the right side of the issues than
anyone else. No party has been on the right side of the
issues to make America solvent, more crime-free, healthier
and environmentally cleaner.
   The Republicans have not owned the '80s and cannot own the
'90s. The popularity ratings of the presidents for the past
10 years are only because they and Congress gave away the
country and brought imaginary prosperity with borrowed money.
We thought we elected a president to run things, but he was
asleep when a secret government was running foreign affairs
from the room next-door in the White House. Yes, we got charm
and one-liners, but nothing of substance.
   Republicans may have been the party of low taxes and lower
spending, but you can't pick and choose and blame the
monstrous deficit spending on the Democrats and take credit
for the lower taxes. Republicans became like the Democrats
when the Reagan-Bush team signed every budget-busting bill
thrown at them by the Democratic Congress.
   We don't need a Teddy Roosevelt, we need a Moses to lead
us out of the wilderness of decay. Miss Noonan's mere
mentioning the need for some such charismatic leader denotes
the failure in itself of the reduction in national stature in
the past 10 years when she said we "are ripe for a Teddy
Roosevelt." The crumbling of the cities is a reflection not
of the machines but a deterioration of American values under
the past 10 years of Republican rule.
   Norman E. Mann
   San Diego
   ---
   Miss Noonan's article was spot-on. Democrats came to power
because they had vision, energy and ideas; they inspired
people to vote for them.
   The entire Reagan era came about because the Republicans
showed clearer vision, expended more energy, and had the
better ideas.
   Republicans are in danger of losing the White House if
George Bush equates golf outings and openness to the
Democrats' proposals with the energy of ideas.
   Miss Noonan and Lee Atwater are right; the Republicans are
"the party of the big tent," but we'd better have something
interesting inside to show the prospective customers.
   Erik N. Koik
   Enon, Ohio
   ---
   I can't help but wonder if Miss Noonan will attribute the
S&amp;L crisis, the expanding budget deficit, our disgraceful
educational system, exorbitant health-care costs and the
deteriorating environment to the "protectors of the people,
protectors of their interests" -- the Republicans. If she was
indeed taught to think, as proclaimed, she would realize that
the roaring '80s have left our country in economic and
environmental shambles attributed to both the Republicans and
Democrats. As was the case in the '60s, the stirrings of
discontent across the nation in the '90s will once again
cause a party shift. Let's hope the players will be
different.

   For Travelers, Gulf Crisis May Foul Up More Than Fares

   Travelers may face not only higher prices but a host of
other inconveniences if energy prices stay up.
   Already, many travel companies are quietly considering
ways to conserve fuel. These range from dropping some airline
flights, to installing harsher lights in hotel rooms, to
using motion detectors to turn off guest-room air
conditioners. Obviously, not all the changes would be a major
hindrance, but travel experts say they could confuse and
annoy people.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The problem is travel companies always try to sneak these
things past people without telling them what they're doing,"
says Chekitan Dev, assistant professor at Cornell Hotel
School. "So you may not know the reason it's happening, but
you'll definitely notice" a less air-conditioned room.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has quickly affected travel
prices, with several airlines announcing fare boosts this
week. So far, though, airlines, hotels and car-rental
companies say they haven't seriously stepped up fuel
conservation efforts, because they had already become more
energy-conscious after the oil crisis of the 1970s.
   Energy costs account for 15% of airlines' expenses and 8%
of hotels'. "We kind of figured out most of the big ways to
save fuel years ago," says Robert Baker, executive vice
president of operations for American Airlines.
   But industry officials concede that unless oil prices
quickly return to midsummer levels, they will be forced to
start cutting more corners. A few of the changes might be
major and easy to spot; if oil stays at $25 a barrel for the
next few weeks, for example, Mr. Baker says his and other
airlines may start dropping some less fuel-efficient flights.
Those might be chronically undersold flights to smaller
cities.
   But most of the changes probably won't seem energy-related
to a casual traveler. Airlines, for example, could tamper
more with air conditioning, recycling more cabin air instead
of using fresh air. Union officials have long contended that
the practice poses a health risk, trapping pollutants and
bacteria in the cabin. "It's a quick and dirty way to cut
fuel costs, and I'm sure some airlines will start doing it,"
says Matthew Finucane, safety director for the Association of
Flight Attendants. Airlines insist they wouldn't recycle more
cabin air unless an acute national energy crisis existed.
   Hotels, which industrywide spend $2.1 billion a year on
heat and electricity, will probably spring some surprises on
guests in the next few weeks. Although declining to say so
publicly, some hotel officials say they're considering using
motion detectors to turn off air conditioners and lights when
guests leave rooms.
   Several major chains already have installed the devices,
but haven't widely used them because they can annoy guests --
by mistakenly turning off power when they are sleeping or
letting rooms get too hot or cold when they're away.
   Some hotels may also shut off bathroom exhaust fans during
the day, install more fluorescent room lights and use more
shower heads limiting water flow, according to hotel
officials and consultants. Undoubtedly, guests would
complain. Many of the new lights save energy, but "are still
really too harsh," says Larry Chervenak, president of
Chervenak, Keane &amp; Co., a hotel consulting firm in New York.
   What's more, hotels in past oil scares have upset guests
by shutting off corridor lights at night, creating obvious
security hazards. Other chains put hidden controls on room
air conditioners that prevented guests from adjusting
temperatures to desired levels. Like airlines, however,
hotels insist they wouldn't take such measures now unless
there was a national emergency.
   "People would have to perceive a real crisis before you
could go that far and not lose business," says John Nicolls,
a senior vice president for Hyatt Hotels Corp.
   Car-rental companies are the least likely to make any
operational changes in the near future; they have very tiny
fuel expenses, since renters generally must buy or pay for
the gas they use. But during the gas shortages in the mid and
late-'70s, several car-rental firms gave customers only a
quarter tank of gas and quietly raised mileage fees.
   "There was a lot of game playing," says Robert Coffey, a
vice president of market planning at Alamo Rent A Car Inc.,
refering to his experiences at past car-rental companies.
   If travel companies go ahead with the less drastic
measures, they aren't likely to publicize them, for fear of
losing guests to less energy-conscious competitors. But Mr.
Dev at Cornell's hotel school thinks the industry could score
some marketing points by letting travelers know about
energy-saving steps. "It's in to care about the environment
these days," says Mr. Dev. "The industry could make itself
look good."

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. reported fiscal fourth-quarter net
income soared 66%, reflecting strength in the company's core
detergent and diaper products.
   In the quarter ended June 30, the Cincinnati-based
consumer-products giant earned $284 million, or 78 cents a
share, compared with $171 million, or 50 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales in the quarter climbed 14% to $6.22
billion from $5.43 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Much of P&amp;G's earnings growth stems from U.S. and
international sales of traditional products, such as
detergents, diapers and shampoos. "The company has invested a
lot in new product development for those products in recent
years and it's paying off handsomely," said Deepak Raj, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   For instance, Pert Plus, a combination shampoo and
conditioner, was introduced in 22 countries during fiscal
1990, building on its base as the leading U.S. shampoo brand.
   The company's latest results also reflect continued
improvements in operating profit margins from the company's
continuing program to trim excess manufacturing and
distribution costs. Chairman and Chief Executive Edwin L.
Artzt has pledged to cut $1 billion in costs during the next
two years. "It's really starting to kick in," said Bonita
Austin, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.
   One area where costs are rising is international marketing
as the company expands product lines abroad. P&amp;G introduced
super-concentrated detergents -- preferred by many consumers
because smaller amounts are needed per washload and packaging
is more compact -- in Europe, Japan and parts of Latin
America. In Japan, those products account for about 80% of
the detergent market. In the U.S., the detergents are sold as
the "Ultra" versions of the Cheer, Tide, Gain and Oxydol
brand names.
   For the 1990 fiscal year, P&amp;G reported net income of $1.60
billion, or $4.49 a share, up 32% from $1.21 billion, or
$3.56 a share in 1989. All year-ago per-share figures have
been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split paid in
November 1989. Year-earlier results also included a $78
million charge related to closing some plants and
consolidating certain operations.
   Analysts said they expect strong results to continue into
1991, regardless of any weakening in the economy, because
consumers continue to buy the company's products in
recessions. Moreover, P&amp;G is introducing more of its U.S.
product lines around the world. For the year, P&amp;G posted
international earnings of $467 million, up 12% from $417
million last year.
   Ms. Austin of Wertheim expects fiscal 1991 earnings of
$5.20 a share, while Mr. Raj of Merrill Lynch estimates $5.25

   NEW YORK -- Bargain hunters bought stocks and bonds,
sparking a rally in both markets. The dollar was little
changed against key currencies as traders awaited
developments in the Middle East.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.01 to 2758.91,
the first back-to-back gains in two weeks. Bond prices rose
about 3/4 point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stock investors continued to favor companies that might be
less affected by a recession. Food stocks, a classic
recession-resistant sector, advanced sharply. CPC
International gained 2 3/8 to 78 5/8; General Mills rose 2
3/8 to 88.
   But many big investors suspect that stocks' recovery won't
last. "The rally is not sustainable," said Joseph DeMarco,
managing director in charge of equity trading at Marinvest.
He thinks the weak U.S. economy will re-emerge as the central
focus once the Mideast crisis is resolved.
   But continuing evidence of weak growth prompted some
investors to step up and buy long-term Treasury bonds.
Roberta Olsen, bond portfolio manager at Banc One Asset
Management, bought in yesterday's sale of $10.26 billion in
30-year bonds.
   "I definitely did buy, I am happy to say," said Ms. Olsen.
At about 1:30 p.m. EDT, talk of a strong auction circulated
through the markets and bonds and stocks rallied. Yields on
the new bond dropped from the average auction level of 8.87%
to 8.75% by the market's close.
   Crude oil prices weakened yesterday -- another support for
both stocks and bonds. Oil contracts for September delivery
fell 29 cents a barrel to $25.67.
   Stock trading volume was light, however, and the currency
markets were quiet, too. Many investors continue to stand
aside, waiting for some clear resolution to tensions in the
Middle East.
   One of the biggest players in the Treasury market, the
World Bank, sat out yesterday's auction because of the
uncertainty. Said Althea Duersten, senior manager of the
World Bank's $9 billion bond portfolio: "The markets are
better at quantifying economic risk than political risk.
We're not making a major stand when political affairs could
blow up when the market's closed."
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks finished higher. New York Stock Exchange volume
totaled 155.8 million shares, the least activity since July
30.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rallied. The new 10-year note, auctioned
Wednesday, gained 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face
amount. Yields dropped to 8.64% from the average auction
level of 8.77%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar finished little changed against most
currencies. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted
at 1.5965 marks, up from 1.5925 marks late Wednesday, and
unchanged at 149.80 yen.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The California department of insurance
said the state's Supreme Court denied an appeal that could
have blocked the department from seeking recovery of $1.5
billion in damages from reinsurers of Mission Insurance Co.
   Los Angeles-based Mission, which, with its units, has been
in liquidation by California regulators since February 1987,
is claiming the money as a principal asset in the vast
insolvency.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The California insurance department will pursue its claim
for the $1.5 billion at a trial scheduled to begin Nov. 1.
   Underwriters Reinsurance Co., one of Mission's reinsurers,
has led a challenge to a lower court ruling that regulators
are entitled in litigation to seek not only actual current
claims but also an amount equalling projected future claims.
Reinsurers objected to regulators' demands for the far larger
future claims on the ground that their calculation is too
uncertain. Underwriters, Woodland Hills, Calif., is a unit of
Underwriters ReCorp.
   The apparent exhaustion of appeals for reinsurers may
accelerate settlements between the companies -- which insure
insurance companies -- and state regulators in the Mission
case. To date, regulators have recovered more than $300
million through settlements with Mission's reinsurers.

   Donaldson Named
   Big Board's Chief;
   Cost Cuts a Priority

   NEW YORK -- William H. Donaldson, the New York Stock
Exchange's new chairman, says the Big Board must cut costs to
members to stem the exchange's eroding market share.
   "There's got to be a continuing emphasis on the cost and
expense side of doing business," Mr. Donaldson says of the
Big Board, which currently handles about 80% of all shares
traded in its own listed stocks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As expected, the Big Board ended a six-month search for a
new chief by naming Mr. Donaldson as its new chairman. The
59-year-old Mr. Donaldson, a former Big Board director and a
founder of the securities firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Inc., succeeds John J. Phelan Jr., who is retiring
at year's end.
   The exchange also softened the blow for Richard A. Grasso,
who had been actively lobbying to succeed Mr. Phelan. Mr.
Grasso, who has been the exchange's president and chief
operating officer, will take the job of executive vice
chairman when Richard R. Shinn retires at year's end.
   For his part, Mr. Donaldson has a host of tough issues to
deal with, including a slow erosion of the Big Board's
trading business to regional and overseas exchanges, and the
prospect of global 24-hour and electronic trading.
   Reflecting the hard times in the securities industry, the
Big Board had net income of $6.3 million last year, down 40%
from the year earlier, on revenue of $349.3 million.
   Other securities executives and Big Board members echoed
Mr. Donaldson's call for lowering costs to brokerage firms of
trading on the exchange. The Big Board doesn't necessarily
have to be the cheapest place to trade stocks, says Benjamin
F. Edwards III, chairman of the St. Louis-based brokerage
firm A.G. Edwards Inc. and a Big Board director. But "I think
they can get more competitive," he said.
   Mr. Donaldson has strong industry and management
credentials for his new job. He left the securities firm that
bears his name in 1973 to become U.S. undersecretary of state
to Henry Kissinger, and later was founding dean and professor
of management at the Yale Graduate School of Management.
   When he joins the Big Board, Mr. Donaldson says he will
resign from Donaldson Enterprises Inc., a private investment
firm he heads.
   Before selecting Mr. Donaldson, the exchange interviewed
150 people for the job, although there were only a handful of
serious candidates. The exchange "couldn't have gotten a
finer selection than Bill Donaldson," said Mr. Phelan, who
led the nation's biggest exchange for six years.
   Mr. Phelan will become the chairman of the Aspen Institute
and president of the International Federation of Stock
Exchanges.
   Among the challenges Mr. Donaldson says the exchange faces
is using new trading technologies, developing new investment
products and addressing the increasing internationalization
of the financial markets. The Big Board must "explore the
boundaries and competition as they evolve throughout the
world," he said.
   On the home front, he says the exchange should "step out
and be a true self-regulatory organization that takes a lead
on whatever conflicts arise."

   Scientists Find First Clues on How
   Gene Could Cause Nerve Tumors

   Less than a month after reporting discovery of the gene
for neurofibromatosis, often but mistakenly called the
Elephant Man's disease, scientists uncovered their first
clues on how the gene may cause the mysterious malady.
   The neurofibromatosis gene is closely related to genes
involved in cancer, reported scientists with the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Utah in Salt
Lake City.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new finding bolsters hopes for a treatment for the
disease as well as for new insight into the genetic bases of
cancer, researchers said.
   The sudden and rapid advances in understanding
neurofibromatosis, a genetic disease that has baffled medical
scientists for a century, illustrates the power of
biologists' new ability to find or "map" genes. The discovery
of the NF-1 gene, as it's now being called, was announced
July 13, the climax of a search that had begun less than five
years earlier. Now, only four weeks later, the scientists
report they've found the first indications of what the
mysterious gene does.
   "We didn't expect this {discovery} for at least five
years," said Allan Rubenstein, a neurologist at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York and medical director of the
National Neurofibromatosis Foundation which, along with the
Hughes institute, funded the research.
   The rapid progress against neurofibromatosis is likely to
be cited by backers of the new federally funded Human Genome
Project as evidence of the payoffs that can come from
locating or "mapping" human genes. The project, predicted to
cost $200 million a year, is aimed at mapping all 50,000 to
100,000 genes, collectively called the human genome, that are
the biological blueprints for human life.
   Neurofibromatosis, which afflicts about 100,000 Americans,
is so named because its most notable features are fibrous
lumps that grow from the nerves in the skin. In rare cases,
nodules proliferate in the skin and over the bones to produce
grotesque features. John Merrick, the "Elephant Man" who
became a celebrity in England in the 1890s and was the
subject of a 1980 movie, originally was thought to have had
neurofibromatosis but is now believed to have had a different
and far rarer disorder known as Proteus syndrome.
   Most people with neurofibromatosis are of normal or
near-normal appearance but many suffer non-malignant brain
and nerve tumors and/or neurological problems that can lead
to learning disabilities, blindness or deafness. The disorder
also is known as von Recklinghausen's disease, after the
German physician who first described it in 1882.
   The Utah scientists, headed by molecular geneticist Ray
White, reported in the biology journal, Cell, that they had
taken the next step following discovery of the NF-1 gene. The
gene, like all genes, is the molecular blueprint for a
protein. With the gene in hand the scientists said they've
now been able to "read" part of this molecular blueprint. It
produces a protein that is remarkably similar to the GAP
protein, which is known to be involved in the cancer process,
they reported.
   The discovery led the scientists to speculate that the
NF-1 protein, like the GAP protein, normally may serve as a
brake on cell proliferation, preventing a cell from
multiplying into a tumor. If the NF-1 gene is damaged, as it
appears to be in neurofibromatosis, it either cannot make the
protein or produces a non-functioning form of it and the cell
is no longer held in check. Instead it proliferates
uncontrolled and grows into a tumor. Whether the tumor is
malignant may depend on other genes in the chain of genetic
events that lead to cancer.
   Mr. White cautioned that speculation that the NF-1 gene is
a "tumor suppressor" gene is based solely on its molecular
similarities with the GAP protein and its gene and with two
cancer-related genes found in yeasts. But he and other
scientists said that if the speculation is proved correct, it
raises hopes that a treatment for neurofibromatosis can be
found. If true, "we would know from which direction a therapy
might come," said Peter Bellermann, president of the
neurofibromatosis foundation. If the disorder is the result
of the lack of the NF-1 protein, then the disease might be
treated by supplying the protein as a medication, for
example.
   The Utah scientists' chief competitors, a scientific team
at the University of Michigan, agreed. "This is a very nice,
happy outcome" resulting from the discovery of the NF-1 gene,
said Michigan molecular geneticist Francis Collins. "It
allows us to leap-frog over two to three years of research;
it puts us in a position of having a path to follow" to gain
a treatment for the disease.
   Mr. Collins, whose team tied the Utah group last month in
the race to discover the NF-1 gene, said that his Michigan
team has made the same discovery as Mr. White's group and
will publish a paper soon confirming the Utah findings.

   Metropolitan Circuits, a circuit-board maker, said last

Metropolitan to continue doing business, the financing is
absolutely essential," said Richard J. Sandberg, chairman,

and Paul G. McNamara also would become the company's top
executives if they raise between $2 million and $3.5 million
within a month, Mr. Sandberg said July 17.
   If the consultants are successful, the financing would be
used for, among other purposes, retiring the General Electric
debt, Metropolitan said.

   A Lot of People Who Became Limited Partners
   In Real-Estate Syndications Are Finding
   Their Losses Aren't So Limited

   BY NOW EVERYONE who hasn't just arrived from Uranus knows
that cleaning up the S&amp;L mess -- the product of crookery,
bungling and, most of all, the real-estate bust -- is going
to cost a few hundred billion. The government is still a
little vague on exactly how many hundred billion, but
everyone knows exactly who will pay it. All of us will pay
it.
   One group of taxpayers, however, has actual and potential
liabilities far exceeding those of the ordinary individual.
These are limited partners in real-estate syndications. Some
of them were greedy and took the high roller's risk; others
were not and believed they were making safe investments.
Either way, there is no one around to bail them out.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of such partnerships have already soured,
involving dubious investments in resort hotels (the so-called
hotels from hell), Florida nursing homes, office buildings in
the Midwest, shopping malls, and garden apartments hastily
thrown up in the Sun Belt. Even where the investment hasn't
failed, limited partners have been left twisting in the wind,
fearful that their deals may be the next to flop in a
depressed real-estate market that shows no signs of quick
recovery.
   Their exposure is enormous. More than $20 billion of
private real-estate partnerships, mainly speculative shelters
for the rich offering huge tax breaks, were sold between 1978
and 1987, when tax reform stripped away such excessive
benefits. During the same 10 years, smaller investors poured
at least an additional $35 billion into more conservative,
public offerings vetted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   It's estimated that one in five of the latter partnerships
now is floundering. As for the private offerings, there is
general agreement that their investors are in even worse
shape; many of these deals have already collapsed, and many
others appear headed for disaster.
   Meanwhile, some big syndicators have swooned into
bankruptcy proceedings themselves, and on Wall Street the
business of selling new real-estate partnerships is all but
dead. Sales are at their lowest point in eight years. The
only popular sectors are partnerships that build low-income
housing and rehabilitate historical properties, two
activities on which investors can still get sizable tax
breaks.
   What happened? In one sense, real-estate partners helped
finance their own problems. Their syndicates helped ensure
that there would be a real-estate glut -- and an ensuing bust
-- by throwing billions of dollars into properties for which
there was too little real demand.
   But real estate was hot in the mid-80s, and everybody
wanted in. Once, leading partnership purveyors such as
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. could easily raise $500 million at a crack to finance a
single public partnership. This money came mostly from
smaller investors, who put up as little as $5,000 each --
often into "blind pools" whose syndicate operators didn't
even specify (if indeed they knew at that point) which
properties they might invest in.
   The blind-pool approach was common, and so was loading
virtually all the risk onto limited partners. It was and
still is common for syndicators acting as general partners --
those who run the show -- to put virtually no money of their
own into their ventures. Their income source was far safer
and more reliable: fees. These, together with sales
commissions paid to brokers selling partnerships, frequently
consumed 20% of the total take.
   "Limited partnerships are terrible investments, but good
as a gimmick for selling practically anything at big
commissions," says Scott Miller, a partnership analyst in
Houston. "Brokerage firms didn't know anything about real
estate. They didn't have to. These were financial products
put together for the sole purpose of generating fees."
   Other analysts point out that many real-estate
partnerships have been well-conceived, solid and profitable
investments. But they add that investors must realize that
even the best of them are illiquid, long-term ventures,
typically taking seven to 10 years from offering to final
disposal of properties.
   Investors who want out before then generally have to
resort to the informal resale market, as many distressed
limited partners have learned. About a dozen small investment
firms control the action here, and they have been demanding
discounts that start at 30% below the prices investors
originally paid -- when there are offers at all. Buyers are
scarce for public offerings that are in trouble, and
practically nonexistent for interests in private deals.
   Investors in the latter, meanwhile, are facing what
amounts to a double soaking. Stripped of crucial tax benefits
by the reforms of 1986, those private ventures that never
made any economic sense anyway not only have collapsed with
capital losses to the investors but also have left the
investors stuck with extra tax payments besides; under
so-called recapture provisions, the Internal Revenue Service
is dunning them on depreciation taken in previous years on
the venture's properties.
   Still other investors who signed promissory notes to buy
into shelters have refused to pay them, only to be hauled
into court by insurers who guaranteed the notes so
syndicators could borrow against them. "Of the 9,000
limited-partnership investors we represent, maybe half of
them not only have worthless investments but still owe on
their notes," says Herbert Beigel, a Chicago lawyer.
   Sheldon Rabin, a 46-year-old New York ophthalmologist, is
one such client. Starting in 1980, on the advice of his
accountant, Dr. Rabin put close to $1 million into shelters
that bought mostly real estate. "I'm in 15, 16 of these
things, and none of them has worked out," he says. "Every bad
deal that came along, you name it, I'm in it. I really feel I
was lied to and cheated by people who were nothing but
flimflam artists, con artists. They belong in jail with all
the other white-collar criminals."
   Dr. Rabin was after the big tax benefits such offerings
provided, benefits that only come with a fair amount of
speculative risk. But conservative investors in the big
public offerings, which provided much less in tax breaks
(ostensibly in exchange for more safety of principal), have
been badly gored, too. This class of investor includes many
widows, retirees and others living on fixed incomes, and some
feel they were gulled by brokers promising big returns and
playing down the risks.
   "I never, never dreamed it could happen," says Thomas
Russo, a 44-year-old Yorktown, N.Y., electrician. Permanently
disabled by a fall in 1983, Mr. Russo put almost $200,000 of
a settlement from a lawsuit over the accident into
partnerships that haven't worked out.
   Investors in troubled partnerships may find themselves
treated "as chattels, just so much excess baggage to be sold
to the highest bidder," says Laura Ricciardelli, a Chicago
lawyer and partnership consultant. Bankruptcy judges in New
York and Dallas recently let three major syndicators
operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code --
Integrated Resources Inc., Southmark Corp. and Consolidated
Capital Equities Corp. -- put nearly $3 billion of their
public partnerships up for sale without even notifying
partners beforehand that control of their interests would be
changing hands.
   Among the so-called workout specialists wooing distressed
partnerships are the same people who helped run them when
they got into trouble. For example, Evergreen Property
Capital Corp., a New York syndicator of nursing-home deals,
is poised to acquire similar partnerships originally
sponsored by collapsed Dallas syndicator Southmark/Envicon.
The irony: Until about two years ago, Evergreen's three
principals were all marketing officials at Southmark/Envicon.
   They got their foot back in the door by forming a
committee that offered to represent the interests of
Southmark/Envicon investors in bankruptcy court, and getting
$600,000 from them to do the job. But most of the money went
to get the very same investors to legally consent to the
installation of Evergreen as the new general partner.
   Does this make any sense? "A small percentage of the
investors told us they felt we had caused the problems in the
first place," concedes Bruce Weinstein, a general partner of
Evergreen and a director of the committee. "But we weren't
the guys managing the partnerships. Hey, we invested in these
partnerships ourselves. We bought our own story."

   Exaggerated concerns about real estate weakness in New
England have created buying opportunities in the shares of
some of the region's largest banking companies. We recommend
purchase of Bank of New England and Shawmut National.
   -- Dec. 7, 1988, recommendation by David S. Berry, vice
president, Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.

   If not quite a day of infamy for Mr. Berry, that
particular Dec. 7 certainly was not one of his better ones.
Bank of New England rewarded his confidence by losing $1.1
billion in the ensuing year because of rotten real-estate
loans. Shawmut lost $128 million. The stocks of both
companies plunged.
   About the only comfort the hapless forecaster could take
was in the knowledge that he had lots and lots of company:
Few people foresaw the size and the extent of the real-estate
bust. In terms of total losses for commercial and residential
developers, and for their investors and lenders, the 1980s
were the worst decade since the Great Depression.
   But what about the 1990s?
   Don't hold your breath waiting for a turnaround. The
real-estate business isn't going to get much better -- at
least through the first half of the decade. Despite the
losses in the '80s, builders kept building and lenders kept
lending. Now, both property values and construction activity
are going to be depressed by two legacies of the decade -- a
widespread credit crunch and a huge overhang of repossessed
or troubled real estate.
   The credit crunch will eventually promote recovery by
limiting new building. But in the meantime it will thin the
ranks of potential buyers, thus keeping prices depressed. And
the overhang of distressed properties will continue to glut
the market for years, further keeping a lid on values. Both
the federal government and private lenders have already begun
a race to the auction block, and sales of many of their
white-elephant properties are being made at discounts of from
25% to 75% of their construction cost.
   Looking at all this, a real-estate industry often noted
for unwarranted optimism now is glum. A May survey of 400
real-estate executives by Ernst &amp; Young produced a consensus
that the depression in commercial real estate will continue
for five more years. And the National Association of Home
Builders recently pared its estimate of 1990 housing starts
to 1.28 million units, down from 1.81 million in 1986, the
peak year of the decade. The estimate rivals actual
construction in 1982, when home building reached its postwar
nadir.
   In certain hard-hit parts of the country, home prices have
fallen 25% or more in the past five years. Even California
has not been immune; the statewide median home price has
slipped 3% from a year ago, the first such year-to-year
decline in five years.
   "It's extremely difficult to obtain financing for any kind
of housing construction even if it's a gold-plated deal,"
says Houston builder Martin Perlman, president of the
National Association of Home Builders. He says the estimate
of housing starts for 1990, already at an eight-year low,
could be trimmed further.
   There will, of course, be some profit opportunities in the
continuing depression. Investors with iron guts and full
wallets will be able to pick up properties at fire-sale
prices. Strong lenders will expand their market share as
hard-hit rivals disintegrate or pull back. But there will be
many more losers than winners, and the biggest loser by any
measure will be Uncle Sam -- which is to say, all taxpayers.
   The taxpayer share of the total cost of the the savings
and loan bailout, prompted mainly by the collapse of the
real-estate market, will range from $340 billion to $440
billion in the 1990s, according to the most comprehensive
analysis to date, by Sheshunoff Information Services Inc. in
Austin, Texas. Read our lips: That is a liability of at least
$1,400 for every man, woman and child in the U.S.
   Though he's no Donald Trump, not long ago the big names of
New England real-estate finance clamored to press money on
Howard Fafard. "They'd stand in line to offer me a lower
rate," recalls the Milford, Mass., developer. "They were
fighting for business."
   This past April, however, one of his lenders decided to
give him the business. Pressured by federal bank examiners to
reduce the number of its real-estate loans, Bank of Boston
shut down his revolving credit line. When other previously
eager lenders declined to come to his rescue, the 30-year-old
Fafard Cos. landed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   Which, more or less, is the fate of a growing number of
real-estate developers these days. The gusher of cash that
watered the industry -- and that led to gross overbuilding
and the ensuing collapse of much of the S&amp;L industry -- now
has been largely shut off at the spigot by frightened lenders
and their regulators. The decadelong lending binge for
construction of homes, hotels, shopping centers, apartment
projects and office buildings clearly is over.
   Over the last six months, growth in construction loans
held by banks has come to a virtual halt, according to
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. Among thrifts,
meanwhile, construction loans plunged 22% in the first
quarter from the year-earlier period. A Federal Reserve
survey in May found that about 80% of the nation's banks had
tightened their real-estate lending standards.
   The pullback by the banks is particularly important. In
the gaudier days of the boom, they were only one financing
source; the S&amp;Ls were pouring cash into the business, and a
small army of syndicators were doing the same, with money
raised from investors in private and public offerings.
Insurance companies stepped up their lending, too.
   Now, much of the S&amp;L industry is either defunct or
fighting for survival, and the syndicators have either been
blown away by tax-law changes in 1986 or run into the ground
by shabby performance. No new money there. Insurers, turned
on to real estate in the '80s, are now turning off. "We don't
see anything that would cause us to want to spend any more
time or energy" in commercial property, says Gordon Oakes
Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Monarch Capital
Corp. in Springfield, Mass. The insurance firm recently set
aside a $72 million reserve to cover losses from a planned
three-year commercial-property sale.
   So, in many regions, actual and prospective borrowers have
been looking to the banks to fill the financing gap. They
have been disappointed, and they will continue to be
disappointed. The banks, suffering large exposures from bum
real-estate loans of their own, are a lot less interested in
helping the industry out of a hole than they are in saving
their own skins. And even if they were so inclined, their
regulators might not let them.
   The banks can hardly be blamed for slamming down the
credit window for a while. Between 1982 and 1989, they and
their S&amp;L brethren lost a combined $75 billion on bad
real-estate loans. Among bank credit problems, real estate is
"public enemy No. 1," says one expert in bank securities.
   Citicorp, the nation's biggest bank, estimates that as
many as 15% of its commercial real-estate loans, which total
$12.6 billion, could be in trouble by year end. The figure
could run even higher after a coming audit by Federal bank
examiners; in recent months they have been especially
merciless in forcing banks to reclassify many of their
real-estate loans as problem loans.
   Which means, in effect, that it is hard to find anybody
willing to put up front money. "Every previous boom-and-bust
cycle in Arizona has ended because financing came in. What's
different about this one is that the S&amp;Ls have been blown
out, and the banks are paralyzed," says Edward Carson,
chairman and chief executive officer of First Interstate
Bancorp in Los Angeles, which has major real-estate loan
liabilities in Arizona and several other states.
   "Liquidity available to the real-estate industry appears
to be at its lowest point since the end of World War II,"
says Jess Hay, chairman and chief executive officer of Lomas
Financial Corp. in Dallas. He ought to know. The
financial-services and real-estate concern filed its own
bankruptcy-law petition last fall, and this past March took a
$505 million special charge, indicating that, like many, it
is still exploring the depth of its own real-estate problems.
   Most of the biggest developers in the business say that
they have been able to survive the credit crunch so far, but
a continuing drought of cash would change that. The legion of
small builders, heavily dependent on up-front loans from
banks and S&amp;Ls, are already in deep trouble, and some larger
firms are joining them. Projects are being abandoned or
scaled back from coast to coast. "Everybody today has been
humbled," says Samuel Alpert, executive vice president of
Oliver Group Inc. in Shawnee-Mission, Kan., a developer of
multifamily housing that isn't doing much developing these
days.
   A growing minority of industry observers are now seriously
concerned that the credit crunch may nudge the whole national
economy into recession. "Liquidity was probably way too loose
before, but now it is too tight," says Dennis Jacobe,
research director for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions. "I would argue that it will bring a recession."
   Total returns on prime commercial space over the past year
were less than the comparable rate on a U.S. Treasury bill,
according to Frank Russell Co., a Tacoma, Wash., real-estate
adviser to institutional investors. Says Blake Eagle,
president of the Frank Russell real-estate-consulting group:
"Rhetorically, one has to ask, `Why would I invest in real
estate when returns on T-bills are higher?' That is being
asked on a lot of different fronts."
   Realizing this, a good part of the industry has simply
gone to sleep. "A lot of lenders, buyers and developers have
crawled in a hole and zipped up the cover," says Jack
Hancock, executive vice president of the real-estate
industries group at Security Pacific National Bank in Los
Angeles.
   From a broader perspective, the bust is a correction that
was long overdue; though the picture varies from region to
region, taken as a whole the current glut of commercial
office space is so great that the nation would be adequately
served even if no new building took place for five or even 10
years.
   Making matters worse, if possible, is some $60 billion in
foreclosed real estate and about $68 billion in delinquent
real estate held by banks, by thrifts and -- courtesy of the
S&amp;L debacle -- by Uncle Sam, who now reluctantly runs the
nation's largest real-estate operation. Each of these
entities wants to put its real-estate problems behind it, and
fast. Each is afraid that the others -- particularly the
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal holding tank for
properties of failed institutions -- will throw so much
property on the market that prices will collapse.
   And so all of them are rushing to the auction block, with
predictable results: Property is being dumped pell-mell on
already-depressed markets, and prices are indeed cut-rate.
(Another complication: The lenders and their regulators are
shooting themselves in the foot. Their tightened credit
policies are reducing the number of eligible bidders, hurting
prices even more.)
   The banks got in early. First Interstate's Texas banking
unit, for example, sold $450 million in foreclosed property
and related assets last year. It hopes to sell at least $750
million more this year, but it is fearful about the
prospective impact of big RTC sales that have just begun.
   "Nobody knows the full impact of {the RTC sales}. There is
always a chance of a regional or national recession, and
given that the portfolio was the size it was, we needed to
move it faster," says Allen Brown, executive vice president
of the First Interstate unit. "I think everybody will come
around to doing it this way. There is just too much property
to be moved."
   Yet another depressant for the market: Many relatively
healthy thrifts are also being forced to sell real estate, a
consequence of the bailout law that Congress passed last
year.
   The law requires S&amp;Ls to raise extra capital to back any
direct investments they might have in real estate; since
capital is nearly impossible for most to raise these days,
they are being forced to sell the property instead. At the
same time, the same law strictly limits the amount of
financing thrifts can offer on such sales -- which some
executives say will greatly reduce the level of bidding.
   Oak Tree Savings Bank, a New Orleans thrift, is having to
sell properties with a book value of $1.08 billion. It
thought it had found a buyer for $517 million of the property
this spring -- but the deal collapsed when the only party
interested in financing the transaction was Oak Tree itself,
which couldn't do it.
   "We have a fire-sale sign around our neck and a gun to our
head. We have no chance of getting a fair price," says Gerald
Barton, chairman and chief executive officer of Landmark Land
Co. in Carmel, Calif., which owns Oak Tree Savings.
   Some real-estate experts suspect that the insurance
industry will be the next to get clobbered by defaults and
foreclosures. David Shulman, a Salomon Brothers analyst, says
1991 will be the testing time. That's when a huge amount of
five-year commercial mortgages come due that were issued in
the record lending year of 1986.
   "Property values are declining, in many cases to levels
below their mortgage balance," he notes. This, he expects,
will lead borrowers to exercise an option built into every
nonrecourse mortgage loan -- the right to hand the building
back to the lender in satisfaction of the current principal
balance of the loan. With this option becoming ever more
attractive as property values fall, Mr. Shulman expects
mortgage foreclosure rates for insurers to double by 1993 to
2.4% from the current 1.1%.
   Given all this, it's no wonder the real-estate industry is
a little short on optimism. But it's an ill wind indeed that
doesn't blow somebody some good, and amid all the worry over
the bust there are some happy faces to be seen. About 3,000
of them belong to the members of the Happy Church of Denver,
which in March found a new home for its evangelical ministry
in the Beau Monde Shopping Center outside town. The Beau
Monde cost about $30 million to build. Its developer and the
S&amp;L that financed it both went belly up, and the church
walked away with it for $7.8 million.
   "When we first heard about it, we thought it was much too
expensive. But over a period of months, the price seemed to
come down to a more realistic realm for us," says Karen
Cutler, a church official. "Certainly, the Lord blessed us
with a wonderful facility."

   A week ago you surely could have produced quizzical looks
by asking an American, German or Briton whether a NATO
country borders on Iraq. But yesterday Secretary of State
Baker was in Ankara to thank Turkey for its cooperation in
the Iraqi crisis, and no doubt to seek further help from this
strategic partner.
   "There is no question in the minds of anybody, certainly
not the U.S. and Turkey, with respect to the obligations"
under the NATO Treaty, Secretary Baker said. The question is,
would any other NATO country need reassurances from the
Secretary of State that others would respond if it were
attacked with poison gas? But then, Turkey is used to being
treated as neither fish nor fowl.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Turkey is of course the only Islamic nation in NATO. It
is, however, totally secular; it grows wine, sells Stars of
David in the grand bazaar, and has the best record of
democracy of any Islamic nation. It's currently led by Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal -- the kind of leader who, when wounded
by a gunman during an appearance, gets bandaged up and
completes his speech. Sitting south of the Soviet Union and
north of the Persian Gulf, it has a unique geopolitical
location and the second-largest army in NATO.
   Yet Turkey has found its military equipment restricted by
an informal congressional rule that little Greece must get $7
in military aid for every $10 going to strategic Turkey. The
Senate passes resolutions wallowing in the Armenian tragedies
of the old Ottoman Empire that collapsed in World War I,
though in our time the problem has been the murder of Turkish
diplomats by Armenian terrorists. And the European Community
tosses the Turkish application for membership into a dark
file, saying it's "impossible" to consider before, say, 1993.
   Much of the trouble of course revolves around the Turkish
troops on the part of Cyprus where its Islamic communities
gathered after the 1974 fighting. But Turkey did not start
the fighting on Cyprus; the Greek colonels did, trying to
annex the island to Greece in defiance of its 1960
independence agreement. Turkey invaded as a guarantor of that
agreement.
   This was also a turning point in NATO, for the U.S. sent a
letter calling into question the pledges Secretary Baker felt
it necessary to reinstate yesterday. Various Greek
politicians, Andreas Papandreou in particular, have since
used Cyprus to demagog in Greece. With American attention
focused on Turkey's strategic importance, and with a new
conservative government in Greece, perhaps a new arrangement
can finally be reached for the withdrawal of Turkish troops
and safety for the Islamic minority on the island.
   As for human rights, far from producing refugees, Turkey
provides a haven for them. Naturally it took in the more than
300,000 ethnic Turks deported from Bulgaria. But though it
has its own Kurdish tensions, it also took in perhaps 100,000
Kurds fleeing from poison-gas attacks on their homelands in
northern Iraq. Compared with the regimes in either Iraq or
Iran, Turkey uses its authority to offer haven for the
unfortunate Kurds.
   In truth, the main reason so many in the West look down
their noses at Turkey has been the prejudice from the fact
that it is a Moslem country. It is now clearer than ever that
this is a virtue. Turkey is the model modern Moslem country
-- democratic, secular and free market.
   Turkey had already been of great help with Iraq by bravely
-- and expensively -- cutting oil shipments and by providing
a base for U.S. planes. With better treatment from the West,
it will play a key role in leading the Middle East into the
modern world.

   NEW YORK -- Lever Brothers Co. said it has agreed to use
10 million pounds of recycled plastic annually in its bottles
for such liquid household products as Wisk laundry detergent
and Snuggle fabric softener.
   Lever Brothers has agreed to purchase 50% of the output of
a new plastics recycling facility owned by Sonoco Graham Co.,
one of the nation's largest producers of the type of
high-density plastics used in the bottles. The Sonoco Graham
recycling facility, in York, Pa., is scheduled to start
producing the resins in September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lever, a unit of Unilever Group, an Anglo-Dutch consumer
products company, in June began filling bottles that contain
some recycled resins. The new agreement with Sonoco Graham
will accelerate those efforts. By mid-1991, the company
predicts 50% of all its bottles will contain between 25% and
35% recycled plastic.
   Environmentalists have applauded these efforts. Said Sam
Hartwell, a research associate at the Natural Resources
Defense Council, "Creating demand for recovered materials is
an important step in encouraging consumers and municipalities
to recycle."
   But with consumers' interest in environmental protection
soaring, competitive pressures also play a big role. Procter
&amp; Gamble Co. already has announced plans to package liquid
laundry detergents in bottles made partly from recycled
plastic. Colgate-Palmolive Co. also plans to use recycled
plastics in bottles of dishwashing liquids.

   California's largest hospital association sued the state's
health department director, alleging that "woefully
inadequate" state Medi-Cal outpatient reimbursements violate
federal laws and cripple health care to the poor.
   Medi-Cal funds are matched by federal Medicaid dollars to
provide health care to 3.4 million eligible Californians.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems
and the Orthopaedic Hospital in Los Angeles filed a lawsuit
against Ken Kizer, director of the State Department of Health
Service, in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The
association says that outpatient service payments average 55
cents for every dollar hospitals spend to provide the care.
"Hospitals are getting clobbered with these rates," said C.
Duane Dauner, president of the association.
   A spokesman for the state health department declined to
immediately comment on the lawsuit.
   Mr. Dauner said California hospitals lose more than
$575,000 a day providing outpatient services to Medi-Cal
patients. He also said that since 1982, the state has
increased payment rates to hospitals for Medi-Cal outpatients
by 2%, while hospital costs have risen 50%. Similar lawsuits
in four states have resulted in higher payment rates to
hospitals, he said.

   Making the Move:
   Relocation Can Take You From a Hovel
   To a Mansion -- Or the Other Way Around

   RELOCATION. It can be the best deal you'll ever make. Or
the worst. It all depends on where you're coming from -- and
where you're heading.
   Of course, relocation assistance is supposed to make
everything equal. Most packages cover such things as
house-hunting trips, home-sale assistance and closing costs
on a new home. More employers also provide temporary salary
supplements to employees moving to high-cost areas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But, as the 500,000 employees relocated annually know,
there are good moves and there are bad moves.
   Here are some of them. Compiled with the assistance of PHH
Destination Services, a company that assists relocating
families, the moves assume that the relocated executive and
spouse live, with two children, in a four-bedroom home in an
upper-middle-class neighborhood. The goal is to buy a similar
house in a similar neighborhood. The couple have a 30% equity
stake in their current home and plan to put 28.5% down on
their new house.
                                                                                                       

   Dallas to San Francisco
                                                                                                       

   Stay home. The couple, selling their house for $237,500 in
a Dallas suburb, better brace themselves: In San Mateo,
Calif., the same-size house, with one-fourth the land, costs
double the money, $500,000. Since there's little need to run
the air conditioning 24 hours a day, the cost of utilities
decreases about $100 a month. But just about everything else
goes up. Monthly mortgage payments rise 128%, or $2,127;
insurance, 111%; and property taxes, 28%. Overall, total
monthly expenses increase about 80%, or $2,323. The
alternative: squeeze into a two-bedroom condo and pay only
about $289 a month more than in Dallas.
                                                                                                       

   Cleveland to Honolulu
                                                                                                       

   A big loser. The couple sell their traditional two-story
house, with a basement, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, for
$150,000 -- and buy a one-story Honolulu house for $500,000.
Mortgage payments jump almost $3,000 per month, and insurance
costs increase an additional $100. Good news, though:
Groceries decrease by $31 per month. And again, expenses can
be kept about equal by buying a two-bedroom condominium with
1 1/2 bathrooms.
                                                                                                       

   Oklahoma City to New York City
                                                                                                       

   Another loser. The home being sold in Edmond, Okla., is
valued at $105,000. A comparable home in the New York suburb
of Katonah will cost $315,000. Real-estate taxes escalate
400%, or $3,900, and the monthly grocery bill rises $60.
Commuting time, to downtown New York, doubles to one hour and
costs $150. Overall, monthly expenses rise 170%, or $2,411.
If the couple want to keep to their Oklahoma City budget,
forget it: They couldn't even afford a one-bedroom condo.
                                                                                                       

   Boston to Seattle
                                                                                                       

   Not a bad move. A four-bedroom house in Braintree, 20
minutes outside of Boston, will fetch $245,000. A similar
house in Lake Stevens, Wash., can be had for $192,500.
Monthly expenses drop $850. If they are willing to shell out
that $850, they can get an extra bedroom or buy lake-front
property.
                                                                                                       

   Fairfax, Va., to Atlanta
                                                                                                       

   You can't miss on this one. A house in Lithonia, an
Atlanta suburb, would be priced at about $250,000 less than
the same house in Fairfax, Va. -- $105,500 vs. $365,000. If
the family insists on spending that $365,000 in Lithonia, it
could buy a five-bedroom mansion with a pool and Jacuzzi --
on two acres in a prestigious area.
                                                                                                       

   Los Angeles to Detroit
                                                                                                       

   The selling price in Cypress, Calif., is $412,500 compared
with $400,000 in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. But the prices are
misleading: Bloomfield Hills has more prestige. And the
typical lot is 1 1/2 acres -- about 13 times larger than the
typical Cypress lot. Heating bills double the cost of
utilities in Bloomfield Hills; other expenses are about
equal.
                                                                                                       

   Hartford to Chicago
                                                                                                       

   Don't expect much of a loss or a windfall from a West
Hartford, Conn., to Naperville, Ill., move. Although the home
price is almost 10% lower in Naperville ($237,375 vs.
$262,500), real-estate taxes increase 25% to $3,732. All
other expenses are about equal or slightly lower in
Naperville.

   Gillett Holdings Misses Interest Payment
   And Is Seeking to Restructure Huge Debt

   George Gillett, whose broadcast and resort properties are
burdened with $983 million of debt, has missed a
bond-interest payment and is trying to restructure his debts.
   Mr. Gillett's financial travails are described in a
confidential memo to Gillett Holdings Inc. bondholders,
seeking their approval for a proposed series of exchanges of
Gillett bonds for cash and new securities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the memo, Denver-based Gillett Holdings said it
defaulted Aug. 1 on an interest payment due on its 12 5/8%
senior subordinated debentures. The company also said it
"doesn't believe it can find necessary financing to sustain
its operations and to refinance its maturing indebtedness."
   Mr. Gillett didn't return telephone calls yesterday. A
Gillett Holdings spokesman said: "The company isn't at
liberty to comment because of confidentiality agreements with
various parties."
   This isn't Mr. Gillett's first brush with default. Last
fall, SCI Television Inc., a broadcasting company that he
controlled along with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., was
unable to pay certain bond obligations. After months of talks
and threats by bondholders to put the company under
bankruptcy-law protection, SCI Television restructured its
debt. As part of the settlement, Mr. Gillett agreed to slash
his share of SCI Television's equity to 40% from 55%.
   In its memo to bondholders, closely held Gillett Holdings
painted a bleak financial picture. It said it had a $37
million loss for 1989 and a $34 million loss in 1990's first
quarter. The company operates ski resorts in Vail, Colo.,
owns television stations in Baltimore; Tampa, Fla., and two
California towns, and runs a meatpacking plant.
   "This is a credit that needs to be restructured," said Ben
Bendre, a junk-bond analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "The
company's debt in relation to its cash flow is too high."
   Bondholders, however, complained that little of the brunt
of the proposed restructuring would fall on Mr. Gillett. In
the memo to bondholders, Mr. Gillett didn't propose any
reduction in his 100% ownership of Gillett Holdings. Instead,
he asked various bondholders to accept cash and new
securities valued at anywhere from 27 cents to 78 cents for
each dollar of the bond's current stated value.
   Stan Phelps, a bondholder activist who was active in the
fight over SCI Television's restructuring, said it was
"absurd" for Mr. Gillett to seek to keep all his equity while
proposing that bondholders accept losses. Mr. Phelps,
president of S.N. Phelps &amp; Co., said he doesn't currently own
any Gillett Holdings bonds.
   Other bondholders, though, said the proposed terms of the
Gillett Holdings swap may be about as good as they can hope
for. Yesterday, traders were quoting the company's 13 7/8%
subordinated debentures at just 17 cents to 19 cents on the
dollar. Gillett Holdings, meanwhile, is offering some holders
27 cents on the dollar for those bonds.
   Similarly, the company's 12 5/8% bonds, on which Gillett
Holdings failed to make a $15.8 million interest payment on
Aug. 1, were quoted yesterday at about 25 cents on the
dollar. The company has a 10day grace period in which to make
the interest payment, but referred to the bonds as
"defaulted" in its memo to the bondholders.
   Gillett Holdings is offering some holders of the 12 5/8%
bonds 37 cents on the dollar for those bonds. "Most
bondholders are hoping this deal goes through," said one
bondholder who declined to be identified.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which underwrote Gillett
Holdings' bonds, collapsed early this year. In its proposed
restructuring, Gillett Holdings is being advised by Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., which hired much of Drexel's
restructuring team.
   Investors familiar with Gillett Holdings' proposed swap
offer said they believed it was being offered "selectively"
to some of Gillett Holdings' larger bondholders.
   Because it has fewer than 300 bondholders, Gillett
Holdings isn't subject to Securities and Exchange Commission
rules requiring that tender offers be made to all holders. In
its memo to bondholders, Gillett Holdings indicates that it
wants to swap 30% to 90% of various classes of bonds, while
leaving the rest outstanding.
   Gillett Holdings said it has an agreement to sell its
Baltimore television station to Scripps-Howard Broadcasting
Co. for $154.7 million, generating cash that will help pay
down its debt.
   Otherwise, though, it's unclear how much progress Gillett
Holdings has made in dealing with its debt burden. Several
bondholders said they were told recently by the company's
advisers that "two-thirds" of bondholders had agreed to the
swap. On Wednesday, however, Gillett Holdings extended its
deadline for the swap through the close of business today,
suggesting that it doesn't yet have all the approvals needed.

   Appeals Court Stays Order
   To Redistrict Los Angeles

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
granted a one-week stay of a federal judge's ruling that
would create a Hispanic majority supervisorial district in
Los Angeles, potentially changing the balance of power in the
nation's most populous county.
   Judge David V. Kenyon ruled in June that the county
discriminated against Hispanics when redrawing district
boundaries after the 1980 Census. He ordered the governing
board of supervisors to submit a new plan that would help a
Hispanic win a seat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week, the judge rejected the board's plan and ordered
it to accept a new supervisorial district map devised by
civil-rights groups.
   The board, which filed the appeal, applauded the stay. "It
is the first step towards restoring common sense" to the
reapportionment process, said Michael Antonovich, one of
three conservative supervisors on the five-member board who
opposed Judge Kenyon's plan.
   The case was originally brought by the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the U.S. Justice
Department. Although Hispanics represent an estimated 35% of
the county's 8.7 million people, no Hispanic has won a seat
on the board since 1875.
   The appeals court agreed to hear oral arguments in the
case on Aug. 16 in San Francisco to decide whether to extend
the stay, which expires the next day. A full hearing was set
for Oct. 1 in Pasadena, Calif.

   BY NOW YOU'VE READ, in this special report and elsewhere,
about the bust in both commercial real estate and the
residential market. But a couple of questions remain. Why did
it happen when it did? And whose fault is it?
   Too much easy credit and too much greed, leading to too
much building, right? True as far as it goes, but it doesn't
go very far.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The fundamental cause of the real-estate bust of the 1980s
was the way inept and perhaps craven politicians and
bureaucrats destroyed an archaic but crudely effective system
for regulating the flow of credit in this country. This
single series of events brought us a decade in which thrifts,
banks, insurance companies, syndicators and developers ran
amok.
   It all starts back in 1933, when President Franklin
Roosevelt got Congress to pass a law authorizing 100% deposit
insurance. Most other industrialized countries only partially
insure accounts. As a result, they have just a comparative
handful of lending institutions, which are very large and are
closely supervised by a central bank or other national
authority. Conversely, because this country's 100% deposit
insurance made size and capital strength irrelevant, the U.S.
system had spawned more than 20,000 banks and thrifts as of
five years ago. The maze was made even more complex because,
in a bow to our peculiar federal system, deposit insurance
was offered to state-chartered institutions as well as to the
federally controlled ones.
   The nation's nascent state and federal regulatory agencies
couldn't possibly supervise so many institutions very
closely. But the banks and thrifts were reined in by ceilings
on the interest rates they could pay to attract deposits; in
addition, thrifts could make only home loans. By federal law,
banks and thrifts could offer no more than 5 1/4% to 5 1/2%
on savings accounts, and the Federal Reserve Board
periodically fought inflation by driving rates just above
that level. Such Fed moves caused money to flow out of banks
and thrifts and into Treasury bills; that dried up credit and
contracted the economy. Real estate, particularly residential
construction, was always the first to feel the pinch.
   This arrangement worked relatively well until President
Johnson, President Nixon and Congress essentially inflated
the economy starting in the mid-1960s to pay for both the
Vietnam War and the Great Society, a process of deficit
financing that has never stopped. The government-induced
inflation often kept market interest rates above the level
that depository institutions were allowed to pay. Then, in
October 1979, to break the back of that inflation, the
Federal Reserve Board decided to let interest rates rise
without intervening to hold them to a predetermined level.
Those developments raised the prospect of perpetual credit
crunches.
   Alarmed by the inability of banks and thrifts to either
raise their own rates or make profits in an environment they
themselves had created, Congress and the Carter and Reagan
administrations from 1980 to 1982 dismantled all restrictions
on the flow of money to banks and thrifts. Congress, led by
Democratic Rep. Ferdnand St Germain and GOP Sen. Jake Garn,
passed laws that approved deposit insurance up to $100,000 an
account, removed all interest-rate ceilings, and allowed
thrifts to invest in real estate and make commercial
real-estate loans. To avoid large-scale defections by
state-chartered thrifts to a federal charter, the states with
the biggest real-estate markets quickly drove deregulation
even further, giving almost unlimited investment powers to
their savings and loan associations. Thus freed of such state
and federal shackles, thifts and banks could accelerate
lending no matter what the Fed did. Most of that lending
growth was to come in real estate.
   Congress then poured gasoline on this smoldering mess by
passing the Tax Reform Act of 1980, which provided powerful
tax incentives for real-estate investment by individuals.
There was no obvious need for more office buildings and
apartments at that time. But through contributions and other
favors, the real-estate lobby managed to persuade Congress to
do the wrong thing, another process that hasn't ended.
   The results were roughly akin to what happened when
commercial banks during the 1970s recycled Middle East
petrodollars into bad Third World loans. Lenders recycled an
explosion of deposits and investments into bad real-estate
loans and wrongheaded developments. After the severe
recession of 1981-82, real-estate lending and investment
soared. Thrift assets grew from $700 billion in 1982 to a
peak of $1.35 trillion in 1988. Bank real-estate loans more
than doubled, to $760 billion, from 1982 to 1989. Syndicators
and insurance companies increased their lending by huge
amounts as well. The country entered its most sustained
period of real-estate boom. Single-family starts, for
instance, have exceeded one million units every year since
1983, an unprecedented performance.
   The Federal Reserve Board could no longer quickly stop
this kind of credit explosion. And the various regulators not
only failed to adequately supervise syndicators, insurance
companies and depository institutions, but also allowed banks
and thrifts to operate with less and less capital, their only
cushion against losses. Beginning with Federal Home Loan Bank
Board Chairman Richard Pratt, thrift regulators even allowed
insolvent institutions to grow mightily. State regulators in
California and Texas allowed any developer who could fog a
mirror with his breath to take over or start S&amp;Ls, a mistake
that would prove even more grievous than the federal
regulators'.
   Other institutions that were supposed to help monitor the
system also failed in their responsibilities. From 1983 to
1987, investment banks raised $3 billion of equity for many
mutual savings banks with no real capital, such as Meritor
and Goldome, by taking them public. The $3 billion was
leveraged into more than $50 billion of loans, mostly in real
estate. Without real capital, these institutions had little
hope of success and have mostly failed or are failing. The
Securities and Exchange Commission took no action to warn the
public of what was happening. A legion of lawyers,
accountants, appraisers and economists also failed the system
in their putative role as fiduciaries. As an economic
consultant at the time, Alan Greenspan, the current Fed
chairman, was among them, enthusiastically endorsing direct
investment in real estate by S&amp;Ls. That endorsement came in a
1984 study paid for by Charles Keating, the notorious thrift
financier.
   Driven by an endless supply of credit and tax incentives,
a horde of builders and their lending institutions, many of
them run by crooked or negligent developers, did what comes
naturally. Operating in a void created by Congress and
lacking restraint from the Reagan administration and state
regulators, the builders threw up thousands of office
buildings, strip malls, apartment buildings and homes that
soon far outran demand.
   A bust was inevitable even without an economic downturn,
but starting in the mid-1980s, regional recessions rolled
through Texas and the rest of the energy belt, then through
Arizona, then through the Northeast. Congress did its own bit
to obliterate demand by passing the Tax Reform Act of 1986,
suddenly removing all of the ill-advised tax incentives that
helped create the overbuilding in the first place. In 1989,
Congress belatedly passed the thrift-cleanup legislation,
which forced S&amp;Ls out of real-estate development. The bank
regulators likewise cracked down on their institutions last
year, also way too late.
   Now glut, illiquidity and spent demand characterize most
real-estate markets in this country. Prices of many
properties, including homes, have fallen by 25% to 30% in
depressed areas -- more if inflation is counted. In 1989,
thrifts lost $17.9 billion on real-estate loans, compared
with $829 million in 1982; banks lost $3.43 billion, compared
with $211 million. Insurance companies held $5.46 billion of
bad real-estate loans at year end, up from $1.68 billion in
1982. The biggest losses of all will come over the next
decade: $400 billion to $500 billion for the thrift-industry
cleanup.
   It was all predictable and avoidable, given a competent
political administration of this country's credit system.
Economist Albert Wojnilower noted in 1980 that Congress had
severed the Fed's ability to control credit and could
therefore expect untoward consequences. And Mr. Pratt, the
bank-board chairman, warned in writing, just before leaving
office in 1982, that undercapitalized lenders would have to
be strictly supervised by a much enlarged regulatory staff, a
warning ignored by both Congress and the Reagan
administration.
   The mismanagment of our credit system becomes even more
obvious if contrasted with that of other countries. In the
United Kingdom, for instance, home values have recently
fallen by 5% to 25%, mainly because of high interest rates,
and big commercial projects are suffering, because of the
rates and overbuilding. While small developers are failing
and large ones are taking losses, the big commercial banks
haven't been severely hit. Relatively few in number, they can
be closely watched by the central bank, which periodically
prods them into relative prudence. They were warned by the
Bank of England many months ago to ease up on real-estate
development loans. They may eventually take losses, but
nothing of the magnitude of the American commercial banks.
   Moreover, none of the U.K.'s thrifts, called building
societies, are failing. The deposit-insurance system there,
which insures only 90% of accounts and then only below 18,000
pounds (about $33,000), has never been used to pay off a
failure. The thrifts were allowed to invest in commercial
real estate and other new areas starting in 1986, but were
held to stiff capital requirements that protect the insurance
fund. Mark Boleat, chief executive officer of the Building
Societies Association, also notes that there have only been
eight national thrift commissioners in 150 years, providing
order and expertise lacking in America's patronage system,
which results in new thrift regulators every two or three
years.
   "The American failure was the failure of regulation" of
credit, Mr. Boleat observes. Congressional hearings and
regulators' pursuit of wrongdoers fail to put the blame where
it mostly belongs -- with congressmen, administration
officials and regulators. "If a department store leaves its
doors open at night and piles of goods on the shelves," Mr.
Boleat says, "you don't blame the ransackers" as the main
cause of the problem.

   Soviet Union Declares End
   To Bar on Private Property

   Government Is Scrambling
   To Deliver on Changes,
   Keep Republics in Line

   MOSCOW -- The Soviet government ended a taboo that has
barred private property here for generations and now will
allow individual citizens and groups to set up small
businesses.
   The decree is the latest move by the government to deliver
on its promises of economic change. The Soviet Parliament
gave the government until September to produce specific laws
to back up the economic changes approved in June.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are now approaching free enterprise," said Stanislav
Assekritov, a deputy chairman of the State Commission for
Economic Reforms. "We are now actually giving every citizen
the ability to exercise his right to work."
   The central government is hurriedly implementing changes
by decree partly because it is struggling to keep control as
one republic after another declares economic and political
sovereignty. This race between the center and republics makes
unclear the ultimate meaning of any specific development.
   For example, the Russian Federation asserted its
independence with a declaration that could have significant
repercussions for foreigners doing business in the Soviet
Union, according to the government news agency Tass. The
Russian parliament presidium declared invalid economic
agreements with foreigners and deals for the sale of some
strategic resources from Russian territory that were made
with the central government after Russia decreed sovereignty
in June. All deals will be reviewed, and from now on, only
those concluded with the republic itself will be honored.
   The declaration specifically mentions diamonds, precious
metals, oil and uranium. By far the biggest Soviet deal
concluded since the Russian Federation declared sovereignty
was an agreement by the Glavalmazzolato -- the Soviet
administration for diamonds and precious metals -- to borrow
$1 billion from the Swiss arm of De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd. and to sell it $5 billion of diamonds over five years.
   The declaration challenges central control by claiming the
right to review, and theoretically overturn, central
government contracts. But Russia made the declaration
primarily to bolster its political authority, and might
therefore reinstate existing foreign contracts as long as
they are coordinated with the republic.
   The central government hopes to forestall such economic
fragmentation by establishing changes to serve as the basis
for a nationwide market and a new union treaty among the
republics. The decree on small businesses is part of that
plan.
   The decree allows individuals and groups to invest, hire
employees and buy facilities. Foreigners can participate as
partners, although wholly owned foreign businesses aren't
covered. A law on freedom of enterprise will follow, but the
decree itself gives people the right to act.
   The new decree isn't, however, a full freeing of the
small-business market. Such businesses will be allowed to
generate as much income as they can, but the hiring of
employees will be regulated. For example, construction
concerns will be allowed to hire as many as 200 people, and
scientific companies as many as 100, but other industrial
businesses can hire only 25 people and retail sales
operations only 15. Existing cooperative or state businesses
that fit these guidelines can be reclassified so as to take
advantage of incentives the government will give small
businesses.
   The government hopes small businesses will recapture the
enthusiasm that once existed for cooperatives but has
evaporated in the past year. Cooperatives were created as a
way of encouraging entrepreneurial drive without actually
permitting private property. In cooperatives, ostensibly all
company property is collectively owned. The new enterprises
will differ from cooperatives in that a single individual can
invest, own and be responsible for the whole business.
   In the early period of perestroika, people rushed to open
cooperatives. But no mechanisms were set up to enable
cooperatives to get the materials and services they needed
from the labyrinth of central control. Many cooperatives took
to offering exorbitant prices to state suppliers, and
middlemen sprung up to take advantage of the gap in pricing.
The reputation of cooperatives plummeted, and today they are
widely criticized as speculators out to make a fast buck at
the expense of the nation.
   "Many scientists won't join cooperatives because they say
it will discredit them," says Nikolai Lavrov, a deputy
chairman of the Council of Ministers. "But they will be quite
willing to join small enterprises."
   Economic reformers hope that new small businesses will, in
particular, help develop Soviet science and technology.
Experts in the field frequently note that the Soviet Union
has competitive basic research in such areas as new materials
and medicine, but hasn't developed its ideas into products.
   The government will offer incentives for small businesses
that may help prevent them from going the way of
cooperatives. Several of these are designed to help assure
that would-be businessmen aren't stonewalled by bureaucrats
resistant to change. Regional parliaments will be required to
approve or disapprove a new business within two weeks of
application. Reasons for rejection must be explained; the
only acceptable reason is that the business is involved in
illegal trade, such as weapons or drugs.
   The decree also orders regional parliaments to sell or
lease industrial equipment that is lying fallow and to help
small enterprises find and buy or lease facilities. Even
Gosnab, the central state structure that distributes
materials and facilities, is directed to sell equipment and
facilities under its control and provide leasing firms with
equipment to rent out.
   Small businesses will also get tax breaks under the new
tax law starting Jan. 1. Profits reinvested in the business
won't be taxed, and asset amortization will be accelerated.
In the first year of operations, businesses will have to pay
only 50% of the tax they would owe, and in the second year,
75%.
   "We want to create a flexible structure that can respond
quickly to demand and supply," says Mr. Assekritov.
"Everybody will now be free to do the things he likes."

   ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Ratners Group PLC raised its tender
offer for the junk bonds of Kay Jewelers Inc. to 90% of face
value, removing a major obstacle to Ratners's proposed
acquisition of the U.S. jewelry retailer.
   Ratners increased its original offer of 75% of face value
for the $150 million in junk debt after holders balked and
tendered virtually none of the bonds. Ratners's stock-swap
acquisition offer for Kay is conditioned on acquiring more
than 50% of each of Kay's two junk issues.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One bond issue, with a face value of $100 million, allows
holders to force any buyer of Kay to redeem the bonds at full
face value. Ratners said that about $75 million of those
bonds were tendered at the new price, which was reached after
talks with bondholders that ended yesterday.
   Although Ratners has so far managed to acquire only about
10% of the other bond issue, analysts said that the British
jewelry firm is likely to pick up the rest under the new
offer.
   "This was the only major stumbling block to the deal,"
said Robert M. Winer, an analyst with Johnston, Lemon &amp; Co.
"Now it will be consummated."
   The stock-swap acquisition is expected to be completed in
mid-October, said Richard Miller, chief financial officer of
Ratners's U.S. unit, Sterling Inc. Ratners values the offer
at $17 a share, although analysts say that based on the price
of Ratners's shares, the new convertible preferred stock is
worth $14 to $15 a share.

   After Fleeing Invasion Forces,
   Al-Sabah Family Faces
   A Gilded Life of Exile

   BAHRAIN -- On the run, Kuwait's royal family is behaving
much as it does when it runs Kuwait: living better than the
average Kuwaiti, but not too much better.
   While the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Sabah, and his immediate
family fled their palace by helicopter on the morning of the
Iraqi invasion, most members of the vast extended family were
left to fend for themselves. Like thousands of other
Kuwaitis, they made their way out by car across desert
borders to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dusty Mercedes-Benzes and Jaguars fill the parking lot of
the Bahrain Sheraton, where several dozen al-Sabahs are
registered, filling the luxury suites and spilling over into
standard hotel rooms. The Kuwaiti Embassy is putting up
ordinary Kuwaitis at only slightly less-plush hotels such as
the Holiday Inn. The only major difference is that Bahrain's
prime minister pays courtesy calls on the Sheraton-based
refugees. "This is a small place," observes one Bahraini
somewhat apologetically. "We don't have enough palaces for so
many royal guests."
   Members of the royal family don't want to be quoted by
name, saying that the emir should do the talking for the
family in such a crisis. But a few shared their grief and
anxiety, both for their lost kingdom and their family's
uncertain future.
   "We don't know where half the family is -- who got out,
who is still there," says one al-Sabah woman, nervously
dragging a hand through her long dark hair. Half a dozen
female relatives of varying ages sit around the small hotel
room, their dress and faces telling of family fortunes that
have changed radically in a single lifetime.
   The face of the oldest woman, in her 70s, bears the
distinctive blue tatoos of a tribal bedouin, while her
leathery brown skin hints at a youth spent outdoors in
Kuwait's harsh desert climate. Speaking only Arabic, she sits
swathed in a black cloak, or "abaya."
   The youngest woman, by contrast, wears a smart green
dress, speaks fluent English, and has the creamy complexion
of 25 years of living in the lap of luxury.
   The al-Sabah family has ruled Kuwait since 1752, elected,
more or less, from among the nomadic tribes who settled down
by some brackish springs on the Persian Gulf. But until World
War II and the beginning of oil production, being a Kuwaiti
royal wasn't much to boast about. In 1918, a British official
wrote that the then-ruler "and his sons are perhaps among the
worst-dressed and ill-lodged residents of the place."
   Older members of the family remember Sheik Salim, the
ninth ruler, riding through the market, or "souq," most
mornings to chat with his subjects and listen to their gripes
over coffee in a cafe named Abu Nashi.
   Such informality ended as Kuwait expanded, but one
al-Sabah woman says the current ruler, Sheik Jaber, sometimes
wound his headdress over his distinctive beard and went
shopping in the fish market to catch up with street gossip.
One daughter of a previous ruler recalls growing up in the
royal "palace" -- at that time a somewhat dilapidated
mudbrick pile without air conditioning.
   Petrodollars changed everything, bringing the al-Sabah
unimaginable riches. But while they became billionaires,
plenty of other Kuwaitis became millionaires. And even the
humblest saw their children become educated, multilingual
doctors and engineers through the state's lavish provision of
free education. "You can still find a poor Saudi, but you
can't find a poor Kuwaiti," says a Western diplomat.
   The Iraqi invasion may change that. Some of the al-Sabah
are arriving in Bahrain penniless, relying on government
handouts even to buy a cigarette. But most wave away their
financial predicament, either because poverty is
unimaginable, or because other fears are paramount.
   In the Sheraton lobby, al-Sabah men, some in traditional
long white "thobes," others in Lacoste sports shirts, cluster
around a news ticker to read the latest headlines. "We might
be al-Sabah, but we are no better off than you for knowing
what's happening," says one.
   "We can't even find out if Jaber is going to Cairo for the
Arab summit."
   President Bush said Wednesday that he wants the al-Sabah
emir reinstated as ruler. The family he is backing has
generally ruled wisely, investing its oil wealth and building
a fat "fund for future generations" while other oil states
dip into their financial reserves and even borrow money. They
also have allowed a measure of democracy, although only 10%
of the population of 1.7 million has the vote and the
Parliament has been dissolved when it questioned ruling
family corruption or criticized Kuwait's powerful neighbors.
Non-citizens -- some 60% of the population -- rarely get much
share of the state's lavish benefits or its luxury living
standards.
   Although Kuwait means "little fort," the city state has a
complete absence of martial tradition. Instead, it has
survived until now by shrewd diplomacy and remaining
ostensibly neutral.
   The ruling family, like any group of people of its size,
has had its share of scandals. Last year, a British court
awarded damages against two al-Sabah women when their Indian
maid sued them for brutally beating and humiliating her.
   More typical, however, is Hussa al-Sabah, the
Oxford-educated director of Kuwait's Islamic Museum. She and
her husband, also a member of the ruling family, used their
personal fortune to assemble a collection of Islamic artwork
ranging from ruby-encrusted Moghul daggers to rare antique
Persian carpets, all of which are displayed in a public
museum. The fate of that collection, like so much else in
Kuwait, is uncertain amid reports of shelling and looting.
   In an interview before the Iraqi invasion, Shieka Hussa
spoke of her fears that Kuwait would one day "be devoured" by
its powerful and unpredicable neighbors. She also worried
about her 19-year-old daughter's generation -- al-Sabahs who
had grown up entirely removed from any hint of hardship or
challenge.
   "People my age knew the pearl-divers and traders who had
to work so hard to make a living," she said. "I'm worried
that our children will be spoiled, will have nothing to
strive for." Now, the invasion makes such fears look
unfounded. Even if Kuwait is liberated and the al-Sabahs
restored, reconstruction is likely to provide ample
challenges.
   Says one royal refugee, "What we are facing is
catastrophe."

   Environmentalists are hoping for a silver lining in the
cloud over the Middle East -- renewed support for the
alternative -- energy options that fell on hard times in the
1980s.
   But efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil in the
1990s will probably involve a different mix of programs than
were instigated after the 1970s oil shock. In particular,
growing concerns about air pollution make some ideas pursued
in the 1970s unattractive, such as making petroleum
"synfuels" from coal or oil-containing shale,
environmentalists said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'm sure a lot of crazy ideas are going to come out of
the woodwork now" to cut dependence on foreign oil, said
James MacKenzie, an energy expert at the World Resources
Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. "Making synfuels
from oil shale, for example, would double the amount of
carbon dioxide produced per mile" of automobile travel,
possibly worsening the greenhouse effect that scientists fear
is causing global warming.
   Conservation is the fastest, cheapest way to lower U.S.
dependence on foreign oil, say energy experts. But U.S.
prices for gasoline -- even after recent rises from the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait -- probably remain too low to motivate
much conserving, they add. By comparison, European consumers
typically pay two to three times as much for gasoline as U.S.
consumers do, and, on average, use two to three times less
gasoline per capita than Americans do.
   "Much of our national security problem right now is driven
by artificially low fuel prices," said Mr. MacKenzie. "In
constant dollars, they've never been lower" than they were
before the Iraqi invasion. Meanwhile, the average fuel
efficiency of new automobiles sold in the U.S. has fallen 4%
in the past two years, he added.
   However, major cuts in imported petroleum probably can't
be achieved simply by making U.S. cars more fuel efficient,
energy researchers said. They noted that growth in vehicle
miles traveled in the U.S. has largely overwhelmed increased
automobile fuel efficiency achieved since the 1970s oil
crisis.
   In 1988, there were 51 million more cars in the U.S. being
driven 450 billion more miles than in 1970, according to
Worldwatch Institute, which studies environmental issues in
Washington, D.C. Contributors to the trend include expanding
suburbs, more two- and three-car families and little economic
incentive to conserve fuel.
   Thus, energy experts say alternative fuels will be needed
to do much about imported oil. One option is ethanol, derived
from corn, which now comprises about 1% of U.S. automobile
fuel in the form of gasohol. But using grain for ethanol
"hasn't been economically viable without government
subsidies," said Christopher Flaven, a Worldwatch Institute
energy expert. Moreover, the U.S. currently has little unused
ethanol-making capacity to tap, said Mark DeLuchi, an energy
and environmental researcher at the University of California
at Davis. But making ethanol from non-corn raw materials --
various "woody" plants -- might replace significant amounts
of oil in the future, he added.
   Another kind of alcohol, methanol, also can be used for
fuel. But U.S. supplies of it are mainly imported and are
derived from natural gas, whose prices are tied to oil
markets. Methanol can be made from coal, noted Mr. DeLuchi,
but the process is expensive and produces more air pollution
than the processes for making other alternative fuels.
   Perhaps the best near-term alternative fuel, said Mr.
Flavin, is natural gas. "It would require a substantial
investment, but the technology is available to do it," he
added. Hundreds of thousands of natural-gas vehicles already
are on the road in Europe. Last month, General Motors Corp.
announced plans to produce 1,000 natural-gas powered trucks
as part of a joint project with a group of utilities and the
Texas General Land Office.
   In the longer term, electric cars and hydrogen-fueled
automobiles could drastically cut oil use -- and greatly
lessen air pollution, said energy researchers. Practical
electric cars priced in the $20,000 range should be available
within five years or so, said Michael Vail, a spokesman for
Aerovironment Inc., a Monrovia, Calif., concern that designed
a prototype electric car unveiled this spring by General
Motors. "The technology is there, but it will take time to
make it affordable," he added. Still, Los Angeles is planning
to have 10,000 electric vehicles in operation by 1995.
   Practical hydrogen-fueled cars are generally considered to
be at least a decade away. But such vehicles could employ
hydrogen derived from water in reactions driven by solar
power, making them perhaps the least-polluting alternative.
West Germany is the world leader in developing the technology
and has developed a prototype system for using it that is
expected to begin operating this fall, said Peter Hoffmann,
editor of The Hydrogen Letter, a Hyattsville, Md., newsletter
about hydrogen-based technology. Moreover, West Germany and
the Soviet Union recently signed an agreement to jointly
study using liquid hydrogen to power airplanes, he added.

   Market Ends Higher as Technologies
   Spur Continued Rebound; Intel Up 2 1/8

   The over-the-counter market ended at its highs for the day
as some technology stocks continued to rebound.
   The market's recent sell-off caught the OTC technology
group already weakened by a string of earnings
disappointments and pushed them lower than they deserved,
traders say. Now those stocks are outperforming other shares
as the market climbs back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 5.25, or 1.3%, to
412.98, while the Nasdaq Industrial Index, which is more
heavily weighted with technology issues, surged 1.6%.
   Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
added only 0.45%. Intel gained 2 1/8 to 39 1/4 after Merrill
Lynch reiterated its investment rating on the stock. Merrill
Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak told the brokerage firm's sales
force yesterday that "Intel's stock price has fallen nearly
enough to discount a 1991 recession impact on its earnings."
   Jim Tarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht &amp; Quist,
says the technology group looks good to traders, adding that
many buyers are being drawn in by the upward swing.
   "If you've got things to buy, you can't just watch it go
up," he says.
   But Mr. Tarantino cautions that guessing the market's next
move is a tough call with investors so focused on the
uncertainties of the Middle East.
   Mitch Meisler, vice president of world-wide equities at
Shearson Lehman Brothers, says that with those uncertainties
haunting stocks, investors "either have to think long term,
or very near term."
   The market is moving higher, but on fewer and fewer shares
traded. Volume fell to 129.9 million shares, making it the
lightest trading day in more than a week. Wednesday's volume
totaled 144.8 million shares.
   The falling volume worries William Haneman, head of OTC
trading at Legg Mason Walker Wood. He says the market's
recovery will remain suspect until more investors
participate.
   OTC advancers held a strong lead over decliners, with
1,202 stocks rising and only 767 falling.
   Apple Computer lost 5/8 to 39 1/2. This newspaper reported
that Apple has joined other computer makers in opposing a
petition sponsored by Advanced Display Manufacturers of
America asking the International Trade Commission to raise
duties on video displays imported from Japan in order to stop
Japanese dumping of the products. The computer makers argue
that higher duties for Japanese displays could price their
own models out of the market.
   Sun Microsystems slipped 1/2 to 29 3/4, leading the most
active list on volume of more than 2.4 million shares. After
the market closed, Sun reported profit of 51 cents a share
for its fiscal fourth quarter ended in June. The workstation
maker lost 25 cents a share in the quarter last year. Sun
gained 1 point Wednesday.
   Midwest Communications fell 1/2 to 1 1/2 after announcing
that it expects to report a loss of about $1.8 million for
its fiscal year ended June 30. For 1989, Midwest reported net
income of $1 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of
$161.4 million. The company, which installs and services
video and radio communications systems, said the loss is due
to extra costs for its Honolulu airport access control
project and the write-off of software costs, among other
things. As a result of the loss, the company said it won't be
in compliance with some covenants under its bank credit
agreement.
   Eastchester Financial fell 2 1/8 to 9 3/4. North Fork
Bancorp ended its agreement to acquire Eastchester for $20 a
share because of Eastchester's financial condition at June
30. Eastchester reported a loss of $1.1 million, or 31 cents
a share, for the second quarter, which included a loan loss
provision of $2.6 million. North Fork said it would be
willing to make the acquisition on significantly different
terms.
   United Healthcare rebounded 1 1/8 to 17 3/4, after losing
3/4 Wednesday. As reported, the company's chairman, Kennett
Simmons, recently sold his common stock in the company.
United Healthcare says Mr. Simmons sold the stake to invest
in his son's business and to build a house. Mr. Simmons still
owns restricted stock grants and options equivalent to
500,000 shares.
   NovaCare gained 1 7/8 to 20 7/8 after reporting
fourth-quarter profit of 27 cents a share, more than double
the 13 cents reported in the quarter last year. NovaCare
provides rehabilitative therapy to the healthcare industry.
   Lilly Industrial fell 2 to 15. The paint company said its
third quarter earnings will fall below analysts'
expectations, while results for the nine months will be flat
with the period last year. The company cited the downturn in
general economic conditions, which occurred during the
company's third fiscal quarter, as the reason for this
change.
   Immunex jumped 2 to 26 1/2. The company said that the Food
and Drug Administration has approved Immunex's
investigational new drug application for Interleukin1 alpha.
Early next month, Immunex expects to begin Phase I-II
clinical trials to evaluate the drug's safety and effect on
blood-cell growth in patients with cancers that have spread
and are not responding to treatment.

   Retailing:
   Sears's Brennan Faces Facts About Costs

   CHICAGO -- Just a day after stepping back into his old
job, Edward A. Brennan started doing what he does best,
rallying the troops.
   The 56-year-old Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. chairman, who took
control of the company's faltering merchandise group, told a
packed auditorium of managers yesterday that their company
has weathered tough times before. He invoked his heritage at
Sears, where both his father and grandfather worked, and
called for teamwork.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But then came an urgent and ominous message. "We must get
costs under control," Mr. Brennan asserted. "We have a good
idea where the high costs are -- and we need to address
them." Mr. Brennan didn't elaborate.
   The speech signals that Mr. Brennan, who led the Sears
merchandise group to its peak earnings year in 1984 before
moving upstairs, is finally focusing on Sears's biggest
problem. Its costs are among the highest in retailing:
Expenses consumed 30 cents of every dollar in Sears retail
sales last year, compared with 23 cents at rival K mart Corp.
and 16 cents at fast-growing Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
   But some industry executives, stockholders and analysts
wonder what took Mr. Brennan so long. And they aren't sure
he's up to the challenge of turning around Sears. "He was
allowing this to go on," says Russell Thompson, a money
manager at Waddell &amp; Reed, a big Sears stockholder in Kansas
City. "Rather than bring in a top person from outside, they
have a stopgap measure in place. There's no evidence that he
can be successful."
   What's more, skeptics such as Mr. Thompson question
whether the Sears chairman can continue to oversee its
financial service operations while worrying about
merchandising matters such as pantyhose promotions. Mr.
Brennan declined to be interviewed for this article.
   Sears insiders think he can. Despite a string of dismal
earnings reports, they say the two-year-old Sears strategy is
starting to work. It involves adding national brands to the
stores' private-label lineup and setting more competitive
prices while relying less on price promotions.
   Mr. Brennan is understood to believe that he can get
results faster than the former merchandising chief, Michael
Bozic. Mr. Brennan "brings intensity" to the job, says an
outside director. "He brings the background of having done
it."
   But retailing has grown intensely competitive in the years
since Mr. Brennan worked his merchandising magic. Wal-Mart
invaded small-town America, luring away Sears catalog
customers with lower prices and the thrill of store shopping.
Specialists such as Circuit City Stores Inc. and Home Depot
Inc. chipped away at Sears franchises in appliances and
hardware by offering wide selections at low prices. Trendier
chains such as Limited Inc. and Gap Inc. now dominate the
mall fashion scene.
   A recent Los Angeles Times market survey shows how far
Sears has slipped. In refrigerators, a traditional Sears
strength, the company's share of purchases fell to 19.7% in
1989 from 23.5% in 1986; Circuit City's share rose to 19.9%
from 3.5%.
   "Sears has not followed its customers -- and its customers
have moved away," concludes Robert Kahn, an industry
consultant and Wal-Mart director. "It's anyone's guess
whether Sears can get them back," he adds.
   The two-year-old Sears strategy was designed to woo them
back. But Sears has been reluctant to cut merchandise
categories and make space for the revamped departments it
calls "power formats." The only new format now in all 850
Sears stores is Brand Central, focusing on appliances and
consumer electronics.
   The result: Sears is still trying to catch up to
competitors in terms of selection and price. Meanwhile, Mr.
Kahn says, other retailers are already starting to compete on
the basis of efficiency, which involves cost control and
distribution.
   In his previous retailing posts, Mr. Brennan focused on
planning and store remodeling. He built revenue by
advertising special bargains that are outdated by today's
standards. He also trimmed costs -- but didn't slash them.
"They've taken a scalpel to something that deserves a meat
ax," says one industry executive.
   Mr. Brennan's younger brother Bernard used the meat ax
approach to revive profits at crosstown rival Montgomery Ward
&amp; Co. Edward Brennan's move back into retailing is certain to
invite comparisons of the brothers' strategies. Indeed,
people close to Sears say the company's weaknesses became
more evident to Edward Brennan during two months of merger
talks with his brother that ended last week. The younger Mr.
Brennan had proposed merging his company into Sears, but he
wanted to run the show.
   The key elements in Bernard Brennan's turnaround strategy
at Ward were closing unproductive stores, getting out of the
catalog business and dumping unprofitable merchandise lines
such as recreational equipment and home-improvement products.
More than 20% of Ward's employees also lost their jobs.

   To Buy a Thundering Herd of White Elephants

   WASHINGTON -- Lamar Kelly pauses to consider why trying to
sell billions of dollars in real estate held by dead savings
and loans will be a challenge. He clears his throat.
   "A lot of these investment opportunities," he says evenly,
"have some...impaired traits."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With that little bit of understatement, he and his
overworked assistant burst into laughter.
   As the official in charge of the Resolution Trust Corp.'s
mountain of foreclosed properties, Mr. Kelly can be forgiven
a moment of gallows humor. His government agency faces an
impossibly daunting task: It's handling the biggest
real-estate sale of the century, and it's happening at the
worst possible time. Real-estate financing has dried up.
Interest rates show no sign of falling soon. Most of the
country is either charging headlong into a real-estate slump
or clawing its way back from one.
   "Frankly, right now, the principal factors are moving
against us," says William Seidman, the soon-to-exit chieftain
of the government's savings and loan rescue.
   Nevertheless, the one-year-old RTC is trying to persuade
pension funds, insurance companies, private investors,
foreigners and bottom fishers to buy its repossessed real
estate, more than 35,000 properties worth about $14 billion
now. The amount of unloaded property is expected to reach
$100 billion by the time it's all over. If it ever is.
   Mr. Kelly, who gets his drawl from his Alabama boyhood,
can point to few Southern mansions on his books. It's easier
to point to properties with those "impaired traits." These
include a Quality Inn in Phoenix whose absurdly high
operating costs would, in two years' time, make it cheaper to
give away than to continue operating. Then there's the marina
in Louisiana that is only a marina at high tide.
   There is Estrella, the infamous 8,890-acre city in the
Arizona desert, meticulously planned but never built by
Charles Keating, former head of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan Association. And there is a New Jersey housing
development with not one but two entirely different types of
toxic waste.
   Who will see ivory in this herd of white elephants? The
RTC wonders, too. "There's no new Donald Trump out there
getting geared up for the '90s," sighs Mr. Kelly, director of
the agency's asset and real-estate management division.
   Most of the property is too dicey for blue-chip investors
seeking only institutional-quality real estate. Most pension
funds, for example, have glanced at the holdings and don't
plan to look further. Roger Franz of the State of California
Public Retirement System Fund, which has $5 billion in
real-estate holdings, sums it up succinctly: "We haven't
bought anything from the RTC, nor do we anticipate acquiring
RTC property."
   Here's how tough sales are. At a June congressional
hearing, the question of fraudulent sales arose. An irate
congressman asked Mr. Kelly whether it wasn't possible for
borrowers from an S&amp;L to default on a real-estate loans, let
the RTC take over their properties and then come back to buy
them from the RTC for 10 cents on the dollar. "If they were
offering a cash deal, I'm not sure we should turn them away,"
Mr. Kelly said matter-of-factly. No one on the stunned
committee dared argue.
   Even if a buyer has the inclination, bankers aren't in the
mood to make real-estate loans. Borrowers across the country
are streaming into Washington to complain that their
once-friendly bankers have deserted them. "Until the RTC
provides a track record {of completing real-estate sales and
providing some financing itself}, the normal financing
channels won't perform and come to the table," says Norm
Flynn, head of the National Association of Realtors. "Every
piece of property they have is tainted, because they are the
seller."
   Much of the $2 billion of RTC real estate sold by the end
of June went to foreign investors, who were skimming off the
cream, thanks in part to a greater availability of financing
outside the U.S. Canadian investors, also taking advantage of
tax benefits, are particularly on the hunt. Aaron Mills, a
Toronto investor, recently bought a large apartment complex
in Dallas. And a 140-room hotel in Pompano Beach, Fla., was
snatched up by Raymond Malenfant, a Quebec hotel developer.
   Japanese investors have been busy, too. Yukio Kitano, an
investor from Osaka, purchased Stonebridge Ranch, a
6,000-acre development with three golf courses in Dallas.
   But the RTC's sheer size, and the fact that it's a
brand-new bureaucracy, hampers its sales efforts. To meet a
congressional deadline, for example, it rushed to compile its
catalog of real estate, and it is rife with errata. In Texas,
its list of property requiring appraisals is backed up 60
days. "The size of the problem is a problem all by itself,"
says John Aldrich, an Atlanta real-estate consultant.
   Watching the RTC price its inventory has been a virtual
how-not-to-market lesson. Originally, the agency relied
solely on appraisals and wouldn't sell at anything below 95%
of appraised value in depressed areas. Offers barely trickled
in, but plenty of meaningless appraisals were conducted. The
agency abandoned that plan. Now, if a property doesn't sell
in six months, the RTC may mark down the price 15%.
"Aggressive pricing," says Mr. Kelly.
   But that reversal, some say, did nothing but set back the
RTC clock six months. "It's like playing a $50 billion poker
hand and showing the buyer your hand," says Larry Herman, a
Dallas real-estate agent who has sold several RTC properties.
"It's insanity. Who is going to buy now if they know the
price will drop in six months?"
   Government financing is just as sticky. Adopting a stern
posture toward the kind of real-estate speculation that
helped fuel the S&amp;L crisis, the RTC at first refused to
provide any financing. Later, it relented and agreed to
finance some sales provided there was a 25% down payment.
Finally, it quietly dropped that to 15%, but the loan must be
of sufficient quality for sale into the secondary market. Of
the $2 billion in sales so far, less than $100 million have
used government financing.
   It will take plenty of creative government to grease the
skids, real-estate pros say. The RTC has begun tinkering with
much bigger and more aggressive financing schemes, but they
haven't been through the rigorous review process yet. It is
considering, for example, pooling discounted notes on
properties where it provides financing. It is also looking at
ways of selling portions of loan pools that don't meet the
requirements for secondary-market sale.
   As the enormity of the problem sinks in, the RTC must
slash prices more aggressively even as it devises still more
creative financing schemes. The trick is doing it in such a
way that it steps up sales without also increasing the heat
from a scandal-sensitive Congress and White House. "You have
to try every trick that's conceivable to man to move it,"
says Mr. Kelly, "and do it one bite at a time."
   Ultimately, the RTC will rely more on the private sector
for its heavy lifting. As more property moves through the RTC
receiverships, it is put in the hands of asset managers, who
maintain the property and market it aggressively -- cooking
up the transformation of a shopping center, say, into a
school. It is also relying on such tried-and-true marketers
as the Multiple Listing Service. "Lots of people are looking
at our property and don't even know they are looking at our
property," says an RTC spokesman.
   The RTC, however, does have one small advantage working
for it: It has plenty of property from which to carry on its
own business. It is opening sales centers across the country
where customers can browse through property lists, loan
portfolios and everything else it's purveying. The sales
offices are in repossessed property it holds. Its office in
Costa Mesa, Calif., was the opulent Pacific Savings Plaza,
seized this year. Its Phoenix sales office was the
headquarters of Sun State Savings &amp; Loan. In Baton Rouge, the
RTC office camped in a glassed-in section in the middle of a
repossessed shopping center.
   "We're no different from anyone else selling real estate
right now," says Mr. Kelly. "You have to get out there and
market."

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush adminstration has decided for now
not to use the one weapon in its arsenal that could help keep
oil prices down.
   White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday that
the administration had no intention "at this time" of drawing
from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve to offset the
oil shortfall caused by the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait. The
decision came as a surprise to some oil experts, who say use
of emergency reserves would push down the price of oil.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If we're not going to use it when we send troops into the
Persian Gulf, when are we going to use it?" asked William
Hogan, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, who
said a presidential announcement of plans to draw a modest
amount from the reserves could reduce the oil price by "a
couple of dollars a barrel."
   Meanwhile, world crude prices fell about 25 cents a barrel
yesterday as markets awaited fresh news from the Middle East.
And several more oil companies said they were cutting their
gasoline prices.
   Texaco Inc., British Petroleum Co.'s U.S. unit and the
Conoco unit of Du Pont Co. said they were reducing gasoline
prices around three cents a gallon in response to the
declines in crude, which have fallen more than $3 in the past
two days from highs of $29 a barrel.
   Phillips Petroleum Co., which led the price cutting with a
4.5-cent cut Wednesday, said yesterday it was further
reducing prices an average of 1.8 cents a gallon. A number of
other major companies have said they were capping gasoline
prices for some time.
   Oil companies were responding to the drop in the crude
market and to President Bush's call on the industry to show
restraint. But the swiftness of the gasoline-price reductions
is unusual. "We're not in a normal situation," said a
spokeswoman for BP America Inc. in Cleveland.
   The administration's decision not to use its emergency
petroleum reserves is certain to draw political attack. Sen.
Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) has already criticized the
administration for its reluctance. "President Bush has taken
a decisive step by committing American forces to protect our
long-term interests in Saudi Arabia," Sen. Bradley said, but
"unfortunately, the president has not yet acted to protect
the interests of American consumers, who . . . have faced
gasoline-price increases of up to fifteen cents a gallon."
   "We already have a fragile, weakened economy and we don't
need this kind of impact," said Rep. Richard Gephardt (D.,
Mo.). "If we've got the {reserve} we built for this purpose,
we ought to be willing to use it."
   The administration's decision was made public yesterday as
the International Energy Agency, made up of 21 industrial
nations, met in Paris. Following the meeting, Ulrich
Engelmann, the chairman of the group's governing board, said
the group had concluded that no physical shortages of oil
exist at this time, and therefore there is no need to draw
down emergency reserves.
   Later, Undersecretary of State Richard McCormack said in
an interview that there is "a general consensus that things
are on track" and that "there is no need at this time to
release stocks."
   Administration officials say they were reluctant to use
the reserves in part because they didn't want the government
to get involved in influencing oil prices. In addition, they
said the White House is reluctant to use the strategic
petroleum reserve because it would take pressure off of Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and other oil-producing nations to increase
their production.
   But Rep. Phil Sharp (D., Ind.) said the administration
"should be demonstrating to the market place that we have
this major supply of government oil, and we are prepared to
use it." Mr. Sharp is chairman of a House energy
subcommittee.
   The oil markets were relatively quiet yesterday after
nearly a week of pandemonium. "Everybody is waiting for some
new news," said Ted Eck, Amoco Corp's chief economist.
   On the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil
trader Eric Bolling said: "It's been such a rumor mill down
here for so long that any rumor would move the market $2.
Today nothing came out."
   Oil traders seem prepared to drive prices in either
direction. "I wouldn't bet a dollar oil will be $20 or $40 in
six months but I would bet a dollar it will hit both ends of
that range within the next six months," Mr. Bolling said.
   The embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil is expected to remove
about four million barrels a day of oil production from world
markets. Mr. McCormack of the State Department said
agreements by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other oil-producing
nations to boost production can "very largely make up" that
shortfall.
   Many private analysts believe, however, that oil
production may still be as much as one million barrels a day
below its levels before the embargo. If the administration
would agree to fill that gap with oil from its strategic
reserves, "we'd probably be $3 a barrel lower," says Philip
Verleger of the Institute for International Economics.
   Administration officials say they are still willing to use
the reserves, if conditions call for it. One official said a
disruption of Saudi oil fields by the Iraqis might prompt the
U.S. to begin pumping oil from its reserves.
   For oil companies, the question of security of supply has
become crucial, particularly with the curbed flow from the
Middle East and President Bush's reluctance to open the
strategic petroleum reserve. "The best thing is for oil
companies to make sure they don't have shortages," said
Amoco's Mr. Eck. "The worst case is shortages," he added,
from local service stations running out of gasoline to oil
companies short of crude to run their refineries.
   Amoco's refining system is running at full capacity, Mr.
Eck said, as is virtually the entire U.S. refining system. It
ran at nearly 95% of capacity in the week ended Aug. 3, which
effectively is full-out, refiners say.
   Before the Middle East crisis, oil prices had been sharply
lower because of perceptions of a world-wide crude glut. Even
in the latest week crude inventories in the U.S. were 46
million barrels higher than at this time last year. But now
instead of an unwanted surplus those barrels are perceived as
precious stocks that companies are loathe to sell.
   To avoid any run on gasoline supplies, many refiners have
gone to an allocation system at the refinery gate that limits
gasoline sales to individual wholesale buyers to prevent any
hoarding, said Bill Hermann, chief economist for Chevron
Corp. in San Francisco. "We're not going to be delivering or
letting any individual jobber, distributor or dealer buy
three times as much {gasoline} as he bought at this time last
year," Mr. Hermann said.

   Vacancy Rates Are High in Many Downtown and Suburban

   BUILD FIRST, cried the developers, and ask questions
later. So they rushed out to build and build and build -- and
now, sifting the rubble of the ensuing bust in commercial
real estate, they and their lenders are facing the questions
at last. Questions like these:
   -- How could so many people have been so mistaken? (A very
good question. The blinding attraction of money has something
to do with it. So does the psychology of builders.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- How bad are things, anyway? (Very bad. See below.)
   ---
   What a difference a couple of years make. In most parts of
the country, it seemed hard not to make money building office
and other commercial space in the 1980s. Real-estate values
were rising faster than developers could get their buildings
up. Eager to cut a piece of the pie for themselves, an army
of lenders -- syndicators, thrifts, insurance companies,
overseas banks, pension funds -- showered developers with
capital. They took it and built still more, because building
is what they do.
   The result was almost foreordained. Today many cities are
full of see-through office buildings -- few tenants are there
to clutter up the line of sight -- and the gush of capital
has been cut to a trickle. New office space is the last thing
most places need. Among big-city downtown markets, commercial
vacancy rates are 23% in Denver, 24% in Miami and 29% in
Phoenix, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a New York-based
real-estate brokerage and consulting firm.
   Suburbia has not been spared, either. In most places
commercial vacancy rates are higher there than downtown;
Philadelphia's suburban rate, to cite just one, is 21%,
compared with 11% in the city proper.
   Given their psychology, it's hard to blame developers for
the bust. "The nature of a developer is to be optimistic and
aggressive as long as the banks and insurance companies and
pension funds will lend him money," says Jack Sonnenblick, a
New York mortgage broker. Others say that it's hard to find a
developer who isn't absolutely convinced that his project
will be a smash. The other guy's may well fail, he might
concede -- but never his. This kind of thinking is one reason
Donald Trump has been put on an allowance by his creditors.
   A lot of his colleagues aren't in much better shape. To
fill the empty spaces they've built, many are making big
concessions to tenants. In Chicago, 30% discounts on quoted
rental rates are common. Several Boston developers have
offered "signing bonuses" of more than $1 million to lure
tenants.
   The cost of such concessions and continuing low occupancy
rates are making it difficult for developers to cover their
day-to-day expenses, much less their mortgage payments.
Facing major potential losses on loans, some of their lenders
are reluctantly carrying them for a while rather than winding
up as unwilling owners of various white elephants.
   And those white elephants won't change color any time soon
if demographic trends are to be believed. The expansion of
the work force is slowing greatly, indicating only tepid new
demand in the future. "It's not a growth industry anymore,"
says Ronald Rayevich, president of Prudential Insurance Co.
of America's real-estate unit.
   One thing everyone agrees on is that any recovery will be
slow and painful. Salomon Brothers forecasts that up to 14
years may pass until the national commercial vacancy rate
drops to 5%, long considered a "natural" level by the
industry.
   One reason: Total demand for office space is falling at
about the same rate as the decline in new construction. "The
nearly parallel descending paths of supply and demand make it
clear that market equilibrium is several years away and that
a painful process of adjustment continues to lie ahead," says
Salomon Brothers.
   Some major commercial projects undertaken when prospects
were bright are still coming on line and adding to the
surplus. Although new construction essentially has stopped in
cities like Houston and Denver, downtown Chicago and midtown
New York each added about two million square feet in the
second quarter of 1990.
   But real estate is essentially a local business, and
generalizations about the national picture frequently don't
apply to specific cities, states and regions. For example,
one of the hardest-hit regions in the early stages of the
slump -- the Southwest -- now appears on the road to at least
a modest recovery.
   Market conditions are improving in Houston and Dallas, the
first cities beset by what Jack Barthell of Kenneth Leventhal
&amp; Co. calls a "revolving recession" in the nation's office
market -- a recession that has moved from city to city and
region to region over time. Although vacancy rates in Houston
and Dallas remain among the highest in the country,
developers there are benefiting from a Texas economy that is
diversifying beyond oil, from a moratorium on new
construction, and from corporate relocations to the area,
particularly in the Dallas market.
   Denver and New Orleans, two other energy-dependent cities,
have a bleaker outlook. They haven't diversified enough to
offset the impact of falling oil prices, which stifled
industry development and left them with a lot of empty space.
"It's hard to see where the demographics, the economics are
going to come from to turn Denver around," says Mr. Barthell.
   Analysts believe that major cities in the Northeast, hit
much later by the rolling recession, have fundamental
advantages that may help them ride it out. Overbuilding has
not been too severe, and their economies are diverse. "They
are not going to enter the prolonged downturn that we've seen
in the energy patch," says Lloyd Linford, publisher of REIS
Reports, a New York real-estate newsletter.
   Some areas -- Seattle, San Francisco, Sacramento and parts
of the Los Angeles-area market -- have prospered while the
rest of the country has suffered. In several of these cities,
restrictions on growth have worked to sustain the office
market by curbing oversupply. In Seattle, for example,
city-imposed controls on new construction prevented
developers from saturating the market in response to office
demand spurred by the growth of Boeing, the city's largest
employer.
   But some experts think the West Coast's glory days are
about over. In Los Angeles, cutbacks in aerospace defense
work may weaken the office market, and this, together with
new construction on line, could jack up the city's vacancy
rate to as much as 24% from the current 16%.
   Washington, D.C., which has avoided most effects of the
national slump, could also suffer in the future. Because
federal law forbids construction of any building in
Washington taller than the U.S. Capitol, high-rise
overexpansion has been curbed. But low-rise projects have
not, and their completion, together with reductions in the
rate of federal spending, may greatly soften the market
there. "Its day of reckoning has just been delayed," Mr.
Linford warns.
   As for the nation as a whole, adoption of proper
regulatory and tax policy can at least help to discourage
overbuilding in the future, says Prof. Kerry Vandell,
chairman of the real-estate department at the University of
Wisconsin.
   The free market is already imposing a discipline of its
own; fewer developers will be around to overbuild. Indeed,
some analysts see contractions of up to 30% in
construction-related industries. Without the cash to take on
new projects and with so much leverage in existing projects,
says Prof. Vandell, "a lot of the more marginal folks are
just out of the business."

   To Buy or Not to Buy?
   The Answer Isn't as Obvious as Many People Think

   WHEN FINANCIAL planner Tim Kochis moved to California from
Chicago in 1979, he was a stranger in a strange land. "It was
really startling to me how much of a religion real estate was
in California," he recalls. "When I tried to explain that a
home isn't the be-all, end-all investment, I was hooted at."
   No wonder. Home prices in the state had more than doubled
since 1974 -- often only to double again in the late 1980s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But all good things must end. What Mr. Kochis knew, coming
from Chicago, was that home prices could remain flat for
years, or even decline. In 1981, many parts of the country
began experiencing significant deflation in home values. Even
a Californian who bought a home in 1979 and sold in 1983 was
probably a big, big loser. In the last year, California home
prices have, on the average, dropped close to 8% in
inflation-adjusted terms. Other former booming markets, such
as in New England and the New York City area, have been
hammered even harder.
   Entering the 1990s, buying a home as a financial
investment is more of a crapshoot than at any other time
since the Depression. Fundamental factors, such as
overbuilding and a secular decline in household formations,
suggest that even after regional bouts with deflation end,
home prices might trail or match general inflation for years.
And the ugly surprise to most people is that if home prices
just moderately trail inflation, they are usually financially
better off renting rather than buying -- at least in
high-priced areas where the disparity between renting and
buying is the greatest. This is especially true if they sell
and buy another home every five to seven years, as many do.
   The accompanying analysis, prepared by Mr. Kochis's firm,
Deloitte &amp; Touche, explains why. Absent the "rewards" of
heated inflation, carrying costs overwhelm the benefits of
leverage (that is, using lots of debt to buy an asset).
   Consider an individual who invests the down payment and
other after-tax costs of owning a $300,000 home, and then
rents a home for $1,500 a month. Assuming 5% inflation, the
person's cash hoard at the end of five years would have a
present value of $85,681. If the house has no appreciation,
its equity would have a present value of $48,640. That's a
$37,041 advantage of renting over buying. (Present value
calculates -- in today's dollars -- the worth of a future
return on an investment.)
   If the home appreciates at about the inflation rate,
buying is only slightly better than renting; including the
tax on selling the home, the homewner would be $3,391 richer
after five years than the renter. That tax can, of course, be
deferred by buying another home, and in some cases can be
escaped entirely. But if the investor wants access to his
cash, as he has with the renting alternative, it must be
paid.
   Moreover, selling and buying a home mean paying steep
transactions costs -- broker's fees, loan points, and so on
-- that amount to nearly 10% of the value. So the newly
bought home has to appreciate by more than 10% just to break
even.
   "Given the huge transaction costs, buying doesn't make
sense unless the holding period is going to be relatively
long," Mr. Kochis says.
   Conclusion: An expensive house is a superior investment
only if home-price appreciation significantly exceeds the
general inflation rate.
   Just how often does that happen? Well, it depends on the
yardstick you use.
   Judging from the price statistics spewed out by the
National Association of Realtors and the National Association
of Home Builders, it happens quite often. The Realtors' group
reports that the median price of existing homes nationwide
ballooned 41% to $95,300 in April from $67,800 in 1982. The
home builders' association says the median new-home price
soared 96% to $135,900 from $69,300. By contrast, the
consumer price index rose only 34% from 1982 to April.
   But for most individual homeowners, these numbers are
meaningless. For one thing, very strong housing inflation in
the Northeast and California has until the past 18 months
disguised a significant fall in inflation-adjusted prices in
most other regions of the country -- declines that began as
early as 1981.
   But even within local markets, the Realtors' and home
builders' numbers can be greatly overstated. Much of the
housing inflation previously reported in hot markets was due
to the rise in the quality of the new homes built each year:
Average square footage is up nearly 20% in the past decade,
and more homes have two stories, fireplaces, additional
bathrooms, high ceilings and better floorings. Adjusted for
such quality improvements alone, the appreciation of new-home
prices has exceeded the consumer price index only 12 times in
the past 26 years, and over the entire period only marginally
exceeds the consumer price index, according to Commerce
Department figures.
   In addition, luxury homes tend to become a higher
percentage of homes sold during a crunch because wealthier
people can still buy and finance such purchases. And, perhaps
most important, many owners who face big losses take their
homes off the market rather than cut prices drastically.
   One example: The Realtors' numbers show that Dallas
housing prices have fallen 5% since 1985. That's bogus: If a
Dallas home buyer has to sell, he or she will find that the
price has fallen more like 25% to 35% from what it would have
been in 1985.
   "I don't believe those {Realtors'} numbers," says Donna
Blank, a librarian who just moved to Houston from Dallas.
"People are taking losses all over town." Mrs. Blank and her
husband recently sold their home in a middle-class Dallas
suburb for $78,000, a loss of 25% from the price they
originally paid. The buyer of their house lost $40,000, or
about 25%, selling his own Dallas home.
   To be sure, homes tend to be a better investment the
longer they are held, because periodic spurts of inflation
have tended to bail owners out over time. In periods of steep
inflation, housing is still a great hedge because of leverage
-- you own an asset appreciating at five or more times your
down payment. Also, most owning-vs.-renting comparisons
assume that renters will reinvest all the savings from not
owning a house. That may be giving investors too much credit:
Most people aren't disciplined enought to reinvest all that
cash saved by not buying a home. Homeownership is still
valuable as a form of forced savings.
   Mr. Kochis also offers a few other caveats to his
conclusion: The disparity between rental costs and
homeownership costs tends to diminish in areas that haven't
seen heated speculation; it's sometimes hard to find rental
property that is comparable to a large home that's owned; and
if more people catch on to the pitfalls of homeownership,
rentals will quickly escalate from their current bargain
level.
   There is some evidence that a few people are catching on.
Financial planners (outside California, that is) say more
clients are asking hard questions about home buying after
selling a house. Some economists think the recent decline in
home sales and home prices is being worsened by a growing
realization that the back of housing inflation has been
broken.
   "The cost of buying vs. renting has changed dramatically
and has an impact on housing prices," says Dennis Jacobe,
chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
"Without the {expectation of higher prices}, consumer demand
isn't as much as it used to be."

             Buying vs. Renting: By the Numbers
                                                                                                       

   The table and chart compare the costs of renting with the
costs of homeowning (for chart see WSJ -- Aug. 10, 1990). The
conclusion: Homeowning is a clear financial winner only if a
home appreciates annually at a rate above the general
inflation rate -- and that's far from a sure thing.
   This example shows a renter who invests the down payment
and other after-tax costs of owning a $300,000 home, and then
rents a home for $1,500 a month. Assuming 5% inflation, the
person's cash at the end of five years would have a present
value of $85,681. If the house has no appreciation, its
equity would have a present value of $48,640 -- giving the
renter a $37,041 advantage after five years. But this small
advantage would probably be more than wiped out by the
transaction costs associated with buying and selling a house.

   Shearson Merger
   Into American
   Express Clears

   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ended
its three-year run as a public company by proceeding with a
merger into American Express Co., but not before shareholders
got in their last licks at a final annual meeting.
   At the meeting, held in the American Express Tower here,
about 92% of shares voting approved the previously announced
merger into American Express, which had sold a minority stake
in Shearson to the public in 1987. The outcome wasn't in
question; American Express already owned about 60% of
Shearson's common shares outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though it had long wanted to reduce its Shearson holding
rather than expand it, American Express is absorbing Shearson
as part of a major effort -- including a cash infusion of
more than $1 billion -- to revive the big securities firm's
sagging fortunes. Shearson holders will get 0.48 of an
American Express share for each Shearson share.
   Shearson's new chairman and chief executive officer,
Howard L. Clark Jr., said he is "optimistic" about his firm's
prospects now that it is a wholly owned subsidiary of
American Express. Despite enormous challenges, "the longtime
Shearson spirit is very much alive," Mr. Clark said.
   Some individual investors didn't let Mr. Clark get off
that easy, however.
   One investor groused about the plunge of Shearson's stock
price from its initial offering at $34 a share three years
ago to $12.75 currently. "Something certainly is wrong,"
either with the initial-offering price or the present one,
the investor complained.
   Mr. Clark responded: "There certainly is something wrong
with the current situation. We lost $915 million in the first
quarter of this year." But he said Shearson is working to
correct its profit problems.
   In response to a question, Mr. Clark also said the firm's
legal costs are too high, and said he wanted to cut down the
number of lawsuits and arbitration cases the firm faces.
   There were also gripes about inaccurate account statements
(a problem Mr. Clark says is being worked on), and about
untimely responses to investors' complaints (also being
worked on, said Mr. Clark). One investor said it would be a
good idea if Shearson directors, which include former
President Gerald Ford and actress Dina Merrill, traveled more
to branch offices to get to know the company. "Now that
Shearson will be 100%-owned by a travel company, I think
we'll get around," Mr. Clark said, drawing guffaws.
   The chairman said Shearson has attained a 12.5% share of
the individual-investor market this year, up 1%.
   As part of Shearson's huge retrenchment program, he said,
the firm is still in the process of selling off the
properties and paying off the loans of its Balcor Co.
real-estate unit based in Skokie, Ill., a wind-down that Mr.
Clark said should take "three to four" years.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Republicans Persevere in Their Uphill Campaign
   To Woo and Win a Bigger Slice of Hispanic Vote

   WASHINGTON -- At a conference of Hispanic activists here,
Sen. Alan Simpson is having a tough go of it as he defends
the use of employer sanctions to discourage illegal
immigration.
   Struggling to be heard above the buzz of a disapproving
crowd, the Wyoming Republican finally snaps, "I didn't have
to show up, you know."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps not. But for many Republican officials and
candidates, appearances at groups like the National Council
of La Raza, an Hispanic-oriented research and advocacy group
that held its convention here last month, are becoming
virtually compulsory as the Republican Party tries to expand
its base in the post-Cold War, post-Reagan era.
   "Republicans are losing the old dynamics -- anti-tax,
defense, anti-communism, anti-abortion to some extent," says
Republican analyst Kevin Phillips. "I think they're looking
around to see whether there's some new dynamics. Clearly
there's more flexibility {among Hispanic voters}, and an
amenability to Republicans."
   Leading the GOP charge has been President Bush. During his
1988 presidential campaign he vowed to appoint the first
Hispanic cabinet member -- then beat his own timetable by
helping get Lauro Cavazos named education secretary in the
waning months of the Reagan administration. Once in the Oval
Office himself, Mr. Bush not only reappointed Mr. Cavazos but
named a second Hispanic to the cabinet, Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan.
   The president also has appointed Hispanics to other
important posts such as surgeon general and to the federal
bench, as well as to less visible positions on federal boards
and commissions. Overall, White House figures show, Mr. Bush
has appointed 19 Hispanic men and women to positions
requiring Senate confirmation, and 84 of the 2,304 political
appointees throughout the federal bureaucracy are Hispanic.
   While those figures are still a small percentage of all
appointments, many Hispanic leaders give Mr. Bush high marks
for effort, and for something equally important: access. Last
month, for example, he appeared at the National Council of La
Raza's convention, becoming the first sitting president to do
so in the group's 22-year history. He has also made sure that
Hispanic leaders are consulted when issues of special concern
to them arise.
   "He's getting credit and he deserves credit," says Raul
Yzaguirre, leader of the National Council of La Raza. "He's
certainly indicated he wants to be accessible to us."
   In electoral terms, the GOP's courtship of Hispanic voters
might still seem a foolhardy quest. The national party has
been seriously trying to compete for the Hispanic vote since
California-born President Richard Nixon first began organized
outreach efforts. Yet according to ABC-TV's 1988 exit polls,
Democrat Michael Dukakis won about 66% of the Hispanic vote,
more than either Walter Mondale in 1984 (56%) or Jimmy Carter
in 1980 (55%).
   The Southwest Voter Research Institute, a San Antonio,
Texas, research group that focuses on Hispanic issues,
figures that about three out of four Hispanic voters still
identify themselves as Democrats in every state but Florida,
where fervently anti-Communist Cubans have been GOP stalwarts
for decades. Of more than 3,317 Hispanic elected officials
surveyed in 1987, 89% were Democrats and only 9% Republicans.
   Moreover, of more than 20 million Hispanics in the U.S. in
1988, about 13 million were old enough to vote, but only
about 4.6 million were registered, according to the Census
Bureau. The low registration rate comes about in part because
nearly 40% of Hispanic adults aren't citizens and thus aren't
eligible to vote.
   But several other factors combine to convince GOP
strategists that they can't ignore the Hispanic bloc. For one
thing, Hispanic voters are concentrated in the 10 largest --
and thus most strategically important -- states, including
California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois, as well
as smaller but growing states like Colorado and New Mexico.
Hispanic voters also have increased their political
participation substantially in recent years. Voter
registration and turnout both rose nearly 20% between the
1984 and 1988 elections.
   Much of the increase is related to rapid growth in the
Hispanic population. But Andy Hernandez, who heads the
Southwest Voter Research Institute as well as a related
voter-registration project, also sees a substantial increase
in Hispanic voters "getting into the loop" and deciding to
participate in the political process.
   What especially attracts Republican strategists is a
belief that Hispanic voters are less firmly tied to one
political party and more willing to switch when the right
candidate or issue presents itself. "There's an elasticity
there that you don't have with the black vote," says
Republican pollster Robert Teeter, a close associate of
President Bush.
   Moreover, GOP strategists say, many Hispanic voters can be
lured by longstanding Republican positions on such issues as
economic opportunity, defense and "family values." Also
appealing is the relative youth of the Hispanic population --
the median age is only 26.1 years, compared with 27.7 for
blacks and 33.6 for whites -- giving the GOP a chance to make
inroads with a population whose party loyalties haven't yet
taken root.
   The Republicans, says Mr. Hernandez, "don't have to win
all the Hispanic votesthey just have to cut margins. It's
their opportunity to improve their competitiveness,"
especially on less-visible or "downballot" races.
   In some cases, though, the Republicans have found the
process of making inroads to be slow going. In Texas, for
instance, the voter institute's numbers show that 60% of the
Hispanics who voted for President Reagan shifted to Mr.
Dukakis in the 1988 election. "In 1988 we were beginning to
understand that Hispanic poverty had increased," and many
voters blamed Mr. Reagan's policies for that, says the
National Council of La Raza's Mr. Yzaguirre.
   Adding to the problem was a political misstep that,
observers say, made many Latinos feel unwelcome in the Texas
GOP. In 1986, the Republicans had nominated a Hispanic for
state attorney general who, although narrowly losing the
race, garnered more Hispanic votes than any Republican
candidate ever. The candidate had done well in part by
pointedly campaigning in both Spanish and English. Just days
after the election, though, the state party endorsed a move
to designate English as the official U.S. language. "All the
good work got wiped out with that one act," says Mr.
Hernandez.
   "Both parties are serious about Hispanic votes," he adds.
"The question is, are they going to take Hispanic voters
seriously."

   He's Flush With Poker Books

   Keith Robertson collects poker books for the love of the
game, of the books and of the chase. The game came first:
He's been playing in the same "First Friday Poker Club" for
20-plus years. Mr. Robertson, who is 75 years old, lives in
Hopewell, N.J., and is himself an accomplished author with 33
books to his credit. He acquired his first poker volume in
1979, and now has the largest collection in the U.S. and
probably the world. It numbers 99 titles and includes just
about everything from before 1940 plus the best of what has
been published since.
   Mr. Robertson began collecting poker books as a way of
occupying himself while on buying expeditions with his wife,
Elizabeth Woodburn, a dealer in horticultural books. (They
met in 1946 in a Gimbel's book department Ms. Woodburn was
redoing; that was a Wednesday and they were married on
Saturday.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The jewel of Mr. Robertson's library is the first book
ever written on the subject, "Rules for Playing Poker." Its
author, Robert C. Schenck, was the American ambassador to
Great Britain in 1872. While visiting a country house in
Somersetshire, he taught the game to the other guests,
perhaps including Queen Victoria, though that has never been
documented. He wrote down the rules at the request of his
hostess, identified only as "Lady W.," and another guest
printed them up on his private press. The New York Tribune
reprinted his rules in July 1875, and an unidentified
publisher produced them in pamphlet form in the U.S. that
same year.
   Unfortunately for Schenck, poker has always had its seamy
side, and Victorian society clearly did not approve of its
diplomats being associated with the game, at least not
publicly. The event "brought down on me the wrath and
reprehension of so many good people in America," Schenck
wrote to a friend, and the scandal cost him his ambassadorial
position.
   Mr. Robertson found the only known copy of the 1875
American edition at a book fair at Bryn Mawr College in 1982.
He bought the tiny, eight-page booklet from a Washington,
D.C., rare-book dealer, Willis VanDevanter. "When I
discovered I had the first American edition of the first
printed work on poker," Mr. Robertson says, "retreat was no
longer possible; I was an addicted collector."
   As a wish list, Mr. Robertson uses a bibliography of all
the poker books published prior to 1905 that he found in R.F.
Foster's "Practical Poker" (Brentano's, New York, 1905). Of
the 42 titles listed, he is missing only "Poker: Its Laws and
Practice" (Pioneer Press, Allahabad, India, 1879) by Albert
Percy. Mr. Robertson thinks he might locate it in India, but
is not optimistic: "Book dealers in India tend to keep
everything stacked on the floor; they may have what you want
but that doesn't mean you'll find it."
   The books in Mr. Robertson's collection are surprisingly
varied, ranging from the expected "how to" titles focusing on
odds and strategies all the way to moral novels such as "The
Lapse of Enoch Wentworth, the Story of a Player Redeemed"
(F.G. Browne &amp; Co., Chicago, 1913) by Elizabeth Gordon
Curtis.
   In the category of novelties, there's "Poker Smoke and
Other Things" (Reilly &amp; Briton Co., Chicago, 1907) by Percy
Hammond and George Wharton. It begins with an outrageous
history of the game, describing how "Noah wanted to play
poker on the Ark but was unable to do so because there was no
deck." A chapter on "Gratuitous Advice" counsels, "When you
unexpectedly pick up three aces look indifferent and hum a
popular air. This gives the impression that you have a poor
hand." The "smoke" of the title refers not to the art of
bluffing but to a collection of verses on the joys of
tobacco. "Other Things" includes recipes for food and drink
appropriate to the poker table.
   Another novelty from the same period is "Shakespeare on
Poker" (Ballard Publishing Co., Denver, 1906), a collection
of 12 illustrations of hands captioned with verse. Four aces
is "a consummation devoutly to be wished." A straight flush
of diamonds to the queen is "a lady walled about with
diamonds -- look you what I have."
   The social history reflected by Mr. Robertson's books is
not always so benign. "The Thompson Street Poker Club" and
"The Mott Street Poker Club" (White &amp; Allen, New York,
1888-89) portray blacks as dupes and Chinese as venal,
cowardly and easily intimidated. The works claim "a prominent
author" but do not mention any name; a curious book dealer
has identified the author as Henry Guy Carleton. The "Poker
Club" series must have been popular; there were four titles
and multiple editions, including at least one "deluxe"
printing.
   Several books in Mr. Robertson's collection celebrate the
male bonding among poker buddies. One of them is "The Poker
Rubaiyat" (Bandar Log Press, New York, 1902) by Frank Holme,
a highly regarded newspaper artist who fell ill with
tuberculosis in 1901. He didn't have much money, so some of
his poker friends "incorporated" him (he was the first man
ever to have this distinction) and underwrote his treatment
in Phoenix. To pay his friends back, Holme collaborated with
Kirke La Shelle on this unusual volume of 12 multicolor
wood-block illustrations, which he carved with a jackknife.
The artist did not recover and died in Denver in 1904.
   Patterson Smith, a New Jersey rare-book dealer, describes
"The Poker Rubaiyat" as "the most visually striking book on
the great American game," a fitting epitaph for a talented
illustrator. Bandar Log printed 284 copies in 1902 to sell at
$5. Mr. Robertson paid $300 for his copy in 1982.
   Has owning all these books helped Mr. Robertson's own
performance at the poker table? No, he says, you could read
every book on his shelves and still lose at the table. "You
can learn a good deal from the books about the odds and the
possibilities for improving your hand, but the real test of a
good poker player is his ability to judge character."
   His books agree with him. A renowned poker player named
Herbert O. Yardley summed it up in "The Education of a Poker
Player" (Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, 1957): "If you want to
know when to call and when to bluff, identify yourself with
your opponent's cunning."

   Del Webb Corp., a Phoenix, Ariz.-based real estate
development concern, said that it terminated its shareholder
rights plan and that all rights outstanding expired
yesterday.
   A Del Webb spokesman said the move came in response to
shareholder approval at the annual meeting in May of a
nonbinding resolution to drop the anti-takeover plan. The
resolution was proposed by Webcott Holdings, a California
partnership, controlled by James J. Cotter, that holds a
large stake in Del Webb.

   In April, Del Webb agreed to several of Mr. Cotter's
demands to avert a proxy fight at the annual meeting. Del
Webb agreed to expand the board by two members and renominate
four of 10 directors, including Mr. Cotter, whose terms were
set to expire. Mr. Cotter is also chairman of Craig Corp., a

   Merrill Quits Work on Restructuring
   Of Bond Debt Tied to Trump's Casinos

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which has been working on a
restructuring of $1.3 billion of Donald J. Trump's casino
bond debt, is no longer working for the developer, according
to several people close to Mr. Trump.
   Mr. Trump is interviewing other investment houses to work
on the deal, these people said. They said that among the
firms being considered are Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Smith
Barney &amp; Co. and First Boston Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, people close to the situation said Mr. Trump
has offered the critical position of chief financial officer
of Trump Organization to Stephen F. Bollenbach, who currently
holds that position for Promus Cos. As part of a
restructuring agreement with his banks, Mr. Trump had agreed
to appoint a "senior executive officer" no later than Sept.
30.
   Mr. Bollenbach, a highly regarded executive who helped
fend off Mr. Trump's takeover overtures to his company in
1986, declined to comment. Mr. Trump didn't return phone
calls.
   It couldn't be learned why Merrill is no longer working on
the bond restructuring. One possible reason suggested by
people close to Mr. Trump was that Merrill was in an awkward
position because it still holds a substantial portion of Mr.
Trump's Taj Mahal casino bonds, and was the underwriter for
that issue in 1988. The Taj Mahal is one of Mr. Trump's
casinos in Atlantic City, N.J.
   Mr. Trump is believed to be preparing a restructuring plan
calling for holders of at least some of his bonds to convert
their debt into equity in Mr. Trump's three Atlantic City
casinos. Trump officials believe the casinos aren't making
nearly enough to meet about $200 million in interest and
principal payments due in the next 12 months.
   Although Merrill hadn't formally signed a commitment
letter with Mr. Trump, people close to the deal said, the
firm was working under a tentative agreement for about the
past month. About three weeks ago, the Taj bonds were put on
Merrill's "restricted" list of securities that the firm
couldn't trade. That signaled to investors that the firm was
working on a restructuring.
   A Merrill spokesman declined to comment.
   With Merrill out of the picture, Mr. Trump will have to
act fast. On Nov. 15, he must make a $47 million interest
payment on $675 million in junk bonds issued to buy the Taj
Mahal casino. Informal groups representing holders of Taj
Mahal and Trump Castle bonds have already formed, and have
indicated that they intend to extract heavy concessions from
the developer.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is still working on closing the bank
agreement that would include a $65 million loan and a
suspension of interest payments on more than $800 million in
debt.
   Lawyers for the banks and Trump officials continue to work
around the clock, trying to complete the accord. By now,
people close to the agreement said, legal fees have reached
close to $10 million. Mr. Trump will be responsible for
paying those fees, once the bank deal closes.

   BUSH'S MOVES to counter Iraq win support so far, but big
risks lie ahead.
   "The policy is succeeding," says Nicholas Veliotes,
formerly the State Department's top Mideast diplomat.
Jordan's agreement to abide by the trade embargo gives a
crucial boost to the international ban. Otherwise, Jordan
could have been a conduit for food and other goods to Iraq.

   But even if Iraq's Hussein just remains in Kuwait, he can
intimidate Saudi Arabia and other oil producers. Terrorism is
a major threat. Two top terrorists, Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas,
have been in Baghdad. A Damascus group accuses the U.S. of
"enlarging the circle of fire in the Gulf region."
   Most experts think Saddam Hussein gains from a war of
attrition. "The longer it goes, the more voices of impatience
and appeasement will emerge," predicts one top lawmaker.
                                                                                                       

   IRAN AND SYRIA are likely winners in the U.S.-Iraqi
confrontation.
   Iran, which has long despised Iraq and Kuwait, quietly
rejoices over their problems. A fuel-price surge would help
its sick economy. Rafsanjani could try to restore ties to the
West. "We need to create a counterweight to Iraq," says Shaul
Bakhash, a Mideast expert at George Mason University, "and
Iran is the only choice."
   The U.S. wants Syria to keep an oil pipeline from Iraq
closed. Syria's Assad, a foe of Saddam Hussein, is "grinning
ear to ear watching the whole world scramble to try to defeat
Saddam," says Judith Kipper of Brookings Institution. "And
when it's over, he'll try to pick up the gains." But the
crisis also bolsters U.S.-Israeli ties and sets Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, not Assad, as the Arab world's strongman.
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS SEE gains, with Iraqi turmoil giving Bush only a
brief boost.
   The Iraqi crisis "is a big boon for President Bush in the
short term," says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, but GOP
candidates will "be hurt if he gets bogged down in the Gulf
or if there are long gas lines." Early Republican hopes of
picking up three to four Senate seats already were fading.
   Democrats are cheered by Ted Muenster's inroads against
South Dakota Sen. Pressler and GOP Rep. Tauke's failure to
make expected gains against Iowa Sen. Harkin. The costly
Michigan primary drained GOP coffers, boosting Democratic
Sen. Levin's chances. In Indiana, Baron Hill begins a new ad
offensive blasting Sen. Coats's use of free congressional
mail.
   But Republicans still predict a net Senate gain by holding
all their current seats and taking a few Democratic ones,
such as Hawaii.
                                                                                                       

   IRAQ BENEFITED greatly from U.S. aid. Iraq has received
about $5 billion in food subsidies since 1983, $2.5 billion
in export loan guarantees since 1988 and $141 million in
direct export subsidies since 1985. The guarantees were
suspended this year because of abuses, and all other aid was
cut off by the current embargo.
                                                                                                       

   BAD TIMING: Some 38 senators sought to weaken a move to
cut off U.S. credits for food exports to Iraq less than a
week before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The effort to
continue credits, backed by agricultural interests, was led
by Texas GOP Sen. Gramm and supported by such prominent
senators as Bentsen and Dole.
                                                                                                       

   WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS were hired by Iraq until earlier this
year. Iraq paid the law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp;
Walker $360,000 to counsel it on U.S. policy and to handle
some litigation from 1986 until this March. Public-relations
man Edward Van Kloberg III recently got $3,000 for helping on
letters to the Washington Post and other newspapers and has
received $10,000 more since 1985.
                                                                                                       

   SECOND THOUGHTS arise about past rejections of U.S. sales
of Maverick missiles and other arms to Saudi Arabia. Bush
officials will review prior Saudi requests in light of the
Iraqi threat, and "I think we in Congress would be happy to
do that as well," says Sen. Metzenbaum, who often led the
fights against requests.
                                                                                                       

   THE GULF CRISIS fuels demands for action on energy and
defense.
   Environmental groups push a pending bill to require new
cars to average 40 miles per gallon by the year 2000. The
crisis is likely to help Air Force efforts to keep buying
F-15 and F-16 fighters. New fuel-surcharges mean the proposed
airline departure tax is "deader than dead," a Senate aide
says. A move to restore House cuts in military aid to Turkey
is likely.
   Pressure grows to increase the U.S. oil reserve.
Influential Sen. Boren talks of a tax break for oil companies
if prices fall below a certain level; it's the only way some
domestic drillers can get bank loans, he says. But a new GAO
study says more oil tax breaks would lift U.S. output only to
a "limited extent" and could cost between $3 and $14 a barrel
in lost tax revenues.
   Barring a wider crisis, there may be more rhetoric than
action. Costly weapons, such as the B-2 bomber, aren't likely
to be rejuvenated.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Just before the Iraqi crisis, the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy issued a report predicting
that "stable or decreasing prices will be the dominant
feature of the oil market of the 1990s." . . . Some
movie-goers suggest making a film about the crisis and
calling it "Iraqiphobia.". . . Jay Leno, noting that Bush had
frozen Iraqi assets, suggests a tougher move: "How about
putting all their assets in a savings and loan?"

   Eagle Food Centers
   To Report Flat Sales
   For Its Second Period

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   MILAN, Ill. -- Eagle Food Centers Inc. will report
virtually flat sales for its second quarter ended Aug. 4.
Pasquale V. Petitti, the grocery-store company's chairman,
blamed both competition and delays in the concern's plans to
construct new stores.
   He declined to estimate whether earnings were off, saying
the company hasn't yet totaled up expenses. Sales rose less
than 1% to $282.5 million. In comparison, first-quarter
profit rose about 5% to $2.7 million, or 24 cents a share, on
sales growth of 3% to $281.6 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the year ending Feb. 2, 1991, Mr. Petitti said he
hopes the company will post earnings that "equal or exceed"
last year's $10.5 million, or 92 cents a share, on sales of
$1.1 billion.
   Eagle's stock price has dropped 50% since the company went
public about a year ago at an initial offering price of $20.
The company's shares are trading over-the-counter. Mr.
Petitti said the price may have fallen because of delays in
construction of Eagle's new stores.
   At the time the company went public, it expected that two
stores in Roselle and Normal, Ill., would be operating by
last spring, he said. In addition, it once hoped to have
another four stores open this year. However, unexpected
troubles arose over zoning and construction issues in Roselle
and Normal. The company didn't break ground for those stores
until spring and they won't be open until this fall. The
other four were also delayed, though one should be open next
spring.
   Meanwhile, the company, which runs 106 stores in the
Midwest, has faced competition from new stores put up by its
rivals. Last year, about 20 competing stores opened in its
marketplace. This year another 18 will go up, the company
said.
   Still, the company intends to fight back by getting on
schedule with its store expansion plans, Mr. Petitti said. It
plans to open at least four stores next year, relocate six,
and remodel another six.
   The company's efforts to boost sales also include plans to
distribute coupon books in 20 of its individual markets. The
coupons will be specially targeted for the demographics of
each store. For instance, in professional, suburban
neighborhoods, frozen items and flavored waters will be
promoted. In rural areas, the basics, such as baking
ingredients and peanut butter, will be emphasized.

   Price gouging] Unfairly profiting from a crisis] The oil
industry has endured a steady stream of invectives hurled at
it since Iraq invaded Kuwait last week and prices at local
gas pumps soared.
   In oil company spin-control quarters and at ad agencies
around the country, though, the oil companies are thinking of
ways to fight back -- with advertising. Mobil yesterday
became the first of the pack to lash out against its critics,
with a newspaper ad headlined, "Where's the rip-off?" Rising
gas prices, the ad went on to say, have "sparked thousands of
words, most of them accusing the oil industry of reaping
undeserved profits. Industry spokesmen have attempted to
respond, with little apparent success."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mobil's ad, which insists the oil giant isn't passing on
the full brunt of price increases to consumers, almost
certainly won't be the last Big Oil advertising apologia.
Texaco, Exxon, Atlantic Richfield and Amoco are among other
major oil companies that say they are investigating
advertising about the crisis, although all say no decisions
have been made yet.
   "The oil industry and our company have a legitimate point
of view, and it tends to be overlooked in times of crisis,"
says Donald Tuchman, the Mobil public-relations executive who
wrote the Mobil ad. "A lot of people resort to name-calling
and look for a scapegoat, and a lot of times that scapegoat
happens to be business. We hope people will read this and see
that there's a legitimate point of view on the other side."
   As the oil companies grapple with ad strategies, though,
they find themselves in a predicament: how to keep any ad
current when the Mideast situation is in such flux. With
unanswered questions about whether the crisis will escalate
and how long it will last, trumpeting any ad message about
the situation is taking a calculated risk.
   "We've got two armies staring at each other over a border.
We'll see what happens," says an Amoco spokesman. "We're
reviewing a number of different options," he adds, "but right
now we haven't got an answer."
   One option is to simply stop advertising altogether. If
hostilities mount and oil shortages result, ad executives say
that would be the most likely scenario for the industry.
During the 1973 oil embargo, when long lines and sky-high gas
prices were the rule, oil company advertising dried up almost
completely; the companies were embarrassed and baffled over
how to confront consumers who were already irritated by
shortages.
   This time around, should shortages occur, "it's very
probable the industry investment in advertising as a total
might drop" again, says James Hine, managing director of
Ogilvy &amp; Mather in Houston, whose clients include Shell. But
he hastens to add, "as an advertising man, I think it's a
very bad idea."
   A better idea, at least in ad executives' admittedly
self-preservationist minds, would be to tackle head-on in ads
whatever problems arise. The executives are already
scrambling to unearth mid-1970s oil company ads for lessons
in damage control. At that time, after advertising initially
dried up, the oil companies began weighing in with public
service-style ads preaching conservation. They also embarked
on the industry's first appearance-primping image ads, the
kind talking about all the good work they are doing for small
children and trees.
   Shell, for example, introduced the "Shell Answer Man," who
offered tips on saving fuel, in the aftermath of the 1973
embargo. Mobil, which began to issue advertising in
newspapers in 1970, stepped up its campaign and started
discussing major issues in TV commercials as well.
Ultimately, the major networks refused to run the sometimes
politically sensitive commercials, but Mobil continued to run
them on independent stations through the late 1970s.
   As the Mideast crisis wears on, the oil companies may well
look into updating old standards like those. They also may
take a page from investment houses, which rushed to create
new ads in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash.
Then, firms like Prudential-Bache and Shearson Lehman churned
out newspaper and TV ads attempting to calm jittery
investors.
   Among the oil companies, Mobil is perhaps best situated to
create quick turnaround ads like those. It has cranked out
issue ads virtually every week for 20 years, ever since it
began running weekly ads on the New York Times op-ed page,
and by now has the routine down to a science. Yesterday's
"Where's the rip-off?" ad, for example, was written in-house
Tuesday morning and put into type Wednesday, for a turnaround
time of less than two days.
   But even Mobil doesn't know what to say in next week's
ads, or whether to pump up its advertising efforts. "Just as
this situation is in flux, so is our strategy," says Mr.
Tuchman. "I'm sure we'll have much more to say. But now we're
watching the news, just like everybody else."

   JWT's First Nuprin Ad
                                                                                                       

   A new TV commercial for Bristol-Myers Squibb's Nuprin
brand -- one that asks consumers to "Tell Nuprin Where it
Hurts" -- will begin airing tonight.
   The ad is the first from J. Walter Thompson, the New York
shop named just last month to replace Grey Advertising as
agency for the $30 million account.
   Bristol-Myers tapped Thompson, a unit of WPP Group,
following a review in which it asked a few agencies for ideas
on how to fire up sales of Nuprin, an ibuprofen pain reliever
that has been a distant competitor to market leader Advil.
   The Thompson spots show adults as victim to various kinds
of pain, like head and back, and make the pitch that Nuprin
is the answer to all of them. Pain-plagued consumers shown
jogging and driving cars are the spots' stars.
   The spots also feature a neon "body map" showing how
Nuprin goes after pain. And reminiscent of Grey's old
campaign showing the "little, yellow, different" pills as the
only color in otherwise black-and-white spots, the new ads
show Nuprin pills glowing in the "body's" neon hand.

   FOOTE CONE: Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications, Chicago,
reported second-quarter net income rose 9.4% to $7.4 million,
or 73 cents a share, from $6.8 million, or 67 cents a share,
in last year's second quarter. Revenue rose 6.4% to $84.7
million from $79.6 million a year earlier.

rose 4.5% to $5.1 million, or $3.96 a share, from $4.9
million, or $3.73 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Second-quarter revenue rose 10% to $117.6 million from $106.8

   NESCAFE ADS: Nescafe today begins airing ads for its new
Brazilian Supreme and Colombian Gold instant coffees,
positioning the varieties as the choice of those "who have a
passion for coffee." In one ad, a Latin beat rumbles as a
handsome young couple meets for a cup of morning brew. "South
Americans have a passion for life," an announcer says. "And
the coffee they feel most passionate about is Nescafe." The
ads were created by McCann-Erickson's New York office.

   FOR YEARS, it was a mental game that homeowners loved to
play: How much money did I make on my house this year? You
could always count on getting a good feeling from it.
   These days, most people would prefer not to play the game.
For a few homeowners -- particularly in the Midwest -- it's
still tolerable: The increases have been respectable. But for
many others, the year, at best, has been a wash. And for some
owners -- particularly in the Northeast -- the question ought
to be phrased differently: How much money did I lose on my
house this year?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The statistics on the accompanying map were provided by
Runzheimer International, a Rochester, Wis., travel-costs
consulting firm. The figures represent price changes for
typical four-bedroom homes in upper-middle-class communities.
The first number is the average price for such houses sold
during the first half of this year; this is followed by the
percentage change from the year earlier and the change from
three years earlier. Because the homes are in the cities'
most desirable areas, the increases probably overstate the
general price rises in the cities. In addition, some cities,
particularly on the West Coast, show substantial year-to-year
increases. That's misleading. For one thing, most of the
increases occurred in the second half of last year. In
addition, higher-priced homes in Los Angeles and San
Francisco have only recently begun seeing the price drops
that other homes in the area have felt for the past year.

   Your Money Matters -- Investment Dartboard:
   For Pros, It's Business as Usual -- Almost
   ----

   Ever drive your car through a "falling rock zone"?
   Most people keep going pretty much as usual, but with one
eye nervously scanning the cliffs. That's how many money
managers, including the four in this column's stock picking
contest, are investing these days: pretty much as usual, but
with one eye on the Middle East.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If this thing in Kuwait does not escalate into something
really frightening," the Dow Jones Industrial Average will
probably stabilize around 2400 to 2600, said R. Jerry
Falkner. Mr. Falkner, the contest's winner for the six months
ended in July, is director of research for Southeast Research
Partners in Boca Raton, Fla., an affiliate of Dominick &amp;
Dominick. He said rising oil prices will probably "tip us
over into a recession."
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was "a major shock," said Remy
Fisher, runner-up for the six-month period and a vice
president with J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co., a New York
money-management firm. She said most stocks have been selling
at 14.5 times estimated 1990 earnings; that multiple could
drop to 12.
   "I didn't expect very much {from the market} before, and
now I expect even less," said John Doney, chief investment
officer for stocks at National Securities &amp; Research Corp.
The Greenwich, Conn., firm manages close to $2 billion in
mutual funds. Unless the Mideast crisis escalates, Mr. Doney
thinks it won't hurt stock prices much further. But he
"figured stocks were fully priced" this summer, and noted
that "earnings estimates are coming down."
   Alden Stewart, who runs the $1.5 billion growth-stock
account at Equitable Capital Management Corp. in New York,
said that if the Persian Gulf turmoil is resolved quickly,
"The market for growth stocks looks pretty good." But if the
U.S. gets bogged down for months in the region or if Iraq
escalates the conflict through terrorism, it's a different
story."
   In the six months that ended just before the invasion, the
contest's investment pros achieved a handsome return of
26.4%, clobbering a "dartboard portfolio" picked by a random
toss of darts at the stock listings. The dart stocks rose an
average of 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was
up 11.5%.
   Since the contest adopted new rules featuring a six-month
time frame, the pros have two wins and no losses against the
darts.
   For the coming six months, Mr. Falkner recommends Urcarco
Inc., a Fort Worth-based chain of used-car dealerships in
Texas. Urcarco offers financing to people who normally can't
get it -- often people with no credit cards or even checking
accounts -- at interest rates of 20% and up.
   There are plenty of loan defaults: So far, one car has
been repossessed for every four sold. Urcarco accumulates
reserves on the assumption that one of every three loans will
eventually default. Skeptics question whether even that is
enough. As time passes, and the economy worsens, they suspect
Urcarco will get into trouble. But Mr. Falkner thinks the
reserves will prove adequate. "They have revolutionized the
way you sell used cars," he said.
   Urcarco has come way down from its 12-month high of $23 a
share. It closed at $11.125 a share, up 12.5 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday. Mr. Falkner
recommends the stock at as much as $15.
   Ms. Fisher's new pick is AMR Corp., the Fort Worth, Texas,
parent of American Airlines. Financial woes at several major
carriers (notably Eastern, Pan Am and TWA) will soon force
distress sales of some weak airlines' assets, such as routes
and landing rights, she believes. "This is going to create
huge, permanent market-share gains" for the strong carriers.
Also, she said industry capacity will shrink because some of
the weaker carriers' planes "are clunkers; they're not coming
back."
   Now is a good time to buy AMR, she said, because "you're
technically oversold, you've had a round of negative surprise
earnings, people are worried about fuel price hikes, and you
{will be} coming off a lousy 1990 where costs were out of
control." She expects earnings of only $4 a share this year,
but $6.50 a share in 1991.
   At yesterday's closing price of $52 a share, up 75 cents,
on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR is selling below book
value, as Ms. Fisher calculates it. She would buy it at
prices as high as $62 and thinks the stock could hit $80
within six months.
   Mr. Doney, who manages two mutual funds (National Total
Income Fund and National Total Return Fund), likes American
Express Co. The big reason, he said, is the New York
company's successful charge-card business. He figures it is
growing 13% to 14% a year, with an attractive return on
equity of 25% to 26%.
   Things aren't too bad either at IDS, a large American
Express subsidiary that offers insurance, mutual funds and
financial planning. The albatross has been the Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage house unit, but Mr. Doney
thinks Shearson could break even this year.
   American Express closed at $26.625 a share, down 12.5
cents, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Mr. Doney
recommends it at up to $32.
   Mr. Stewart, who runs the $1.5 billion growth-stock
account at Equitable Capital, plumps for McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc., the nation's largest cellular telephone
company. He said he likes it even though "the company is
losing money and will continue to lose money on an
earnings-per-share basis for probably the next three years."
   McCaw, Kirkland, Wash., has cellular licenses (typically
duopolies, two per major city) in areas that include 40% of
the U.S. population, Mr. Stewart said. And "they are adding
subscribers at the rate of more than 50%" a year.
   McCaw's price has come down from a high of about $45 a
share; the Class A shares closed at $21.50, unchanged, in
over-the-counter trading yesterday. Feeding the slide were
worries about competing technologies -- personal
communications networks and specialized mobile radio -- but
Mr. Stewart doesn't think they pose a threat to cellular. If
they do come into use in this country, he said, McCaw may use
them. He would buy McCaw at as much as $28 a share.
   In the coming six months, the pros' picks will compete
against a dartboard portfolio consisting of Affiliated
Publications Inc., ARX Inc., Bank of New England Corp. and
Nashua Corp.

   Chrysler to Postpone Work on Luxury Car
   And Concentrate on New Midsized Line
   ----
   By Gregory A. Patterson and Bradley A. Stertz
   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

<LP>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. said it will
postpone work on a new luxury car to throw more resources
behind new midsized models it desperately needs.
   The change reflects not only Chrysler's weakness in the
middle of its product lineup, but also its limited ability to
handle development of several new products at once.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Company officials said the delay of the large, rear-drive
models resulted from low volume targets for the luxury cars,
codenamed LX; Chrysler's pressing need to bolster its
mainstream products, and concerns over the potential for
higher fuel-economy restrictions. However, the decision
apparently was made before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the
subsequent oil-price shock.
   G. Glenn Gardner, Chrysler's general manager for new
platform engineering, said at an industry conference here
that the company lacked the manpower to develop
simultaneously the luxury models and the two middle-market
cars.
   However, Chrysler spokesmen insisted that the auto maker
isn't reducing its plans to spend $15 billion on products
over five years. They said Chrysler will simply shift more
emphasis behind the midsized car programs.
   The first of the new midsized cars will be the models
currently code-named LH. Company officials and analysts say
the LH cars will be as critical to Chrysler's future in the
1990s as the compact K-cars were in the 1980s.
   That's because the LH car chassis is the first all-new,
midpriced car design Chrysler has developed since the K car.
The K-car chassis still is the building block for most of
Chrysler's current models, including its popular minivans.
   Chrysler plans to start building the first LH cars in 1992
after closing the Bramalea, Ontario, plant that will make
them for 16 weeks of preparation, Mr. Gardner said. The cars
will be sold in the 1993 model year through Dodge, Chrysler
and Jeep/Eagle dealers.
   The auto maker had planned to follow the LH models with
the rear-wheel drive LX cars.
   Chrysler isn't canceling the LX, but is "readjusting the
timing of the car's development," Mr. Gardner said. Analysts
said the LX platform won't come out before the 1996 model
year.
   Instead, Chrysler will step up efforts to consolidate the
chassis for the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim and the
chassis for the Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible into
one common midsized chassis, or platform. Mr. Gardner said
the new midsized cars built on this platform will reach the
market by 1994.
   Privately, Chrysler officials say the new cars can't come
soon enough. The Eagle Premier and Dodge Monaco that the LH
models are scheduled to supplant have never sold well enough
to compete with Ford Motor Co.'s Taurus and Sable models. The
Spirit and Acclaim have been among the company's most popular
cars, but haven't achieved the volume of the similarly sized
Honda Accord.
   Analysts said the decision to delay the luxury car in
favor of the midsized models is a positive step.
   "Given Chrysler's current financial situation, it didn't
seem reasonable that the company could bring all of those
products to fruition at the same time," said Christopher
Cedergren, an analyst with J.D. Power &amp; Associates Inc., an
Agoura Hills, Calif., research and marketing firm. "Now
Chrysler's trying to better utilize its capital."

   WASHINGTON -- World Bank executive directors cleared the
way for Argentina to receive the second $150 million
installment of a $300 million loan approved in late 1988 to
support trade-policy adjustments in the South American
country.
   In other actions, the World Bank cleared a $130 million
loan to Pakistan to help expand natural-gas distribution
facilities and reduce the country's dependence on imported
oil.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also, the International Development Association, a World
Bank affiliate, approved a $64 million credit to China for
agricultural development projects along the Yangtze River.
   The World Bank decided this year to delay the Argentine
loan because the government had failed to carry out broader
economic policy actions required under the original loan
agreement. It was reported last week that the Argentine
government expected to get the money later this month. The
loans would help finance the country's efforts to ease its
import and export restrictions.
   The loan to Pakistan will help finance the construction of
a gas-purification plant at Sui, in the southwestern part of
the country. As part of the same project, Sui Northern Gas
Pipelines Ltd. will increase its gas-distribution network
serving the Northern and Central parts of the country by 300
million cubic feet a day.

   Dollar Rises Against Most Currencies;
   Yen Is Firm Despite Tokyo Stocks' Fall

   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose marginally against most
currencies as world financial markets remained fixated on the
Persian Gulf.
   Five previous sessions of tough trading had clearly taken
a toll on currency dealers. Between bursts of activity,
trading practically dried up. Those who stayed involved kept
their heads down.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Between its high and low for the day, the dollar strayed
less than a pfennig and little more than half a yen.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5965
marks, up from 1.5925 marks late Wednesday in New York. The
U.S. currency was changing hands at 1.3433 Swiss francs,
above 1.3385 francs late Wednesday.
   Against the yen, the dollar was unchanged at 149.80 yen.
   In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 149.55 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of
149.68 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5930 marks; in Tokyo Thursday, it closed at 1.5913 marks.
   Thursday provided some unsettling Mideast developments.
Iraq closed its border in both directions to foreigners,
trapping many inside. U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia swelled as
the Defense Department reported threatening Iraqi troop
movements in Kuwait.
   None of this swayed the dollar much. "So many one-liners
are coming across our screens that the market is a bit
desensitized to news," said Thomas Benfer, a senior currency
marketing representative in New York with Bank of Montreal.
He was refering to the newswire headlines that traders
receive electronically.
   Also keeping rates stable yesterday was the absence of
speculators, many of whom were counting their losses from
previous sessions rather than actively trading, Mr. Benfer
said.
   But unlike previous days, when the dollar sank every time
the Mideast situation seemed to calm down, the U.S. currency
remained well bid up throughout New York trading. A
successful auction of 30-year bonds in the third leg of the
U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding helped to buoy the
dollar.
   Meanwhile, the yen reclaimed ground against European
currencies. The mark fell to 93.83 yen in late New York
trading yesterday from 94.066 yen late Wednesday. The British
pound eased to 279.83 yen from 280.07 yen.
   Pent-up demand for the yen was released by declining
crude-oil prices. The September futures contract on the New
York Mercantile Exchange fell 29 cents a barrel to $25.67 a
barrel.
   Interest in the Japanese currency was somewhat restrained,
however, by another reversal on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
After having recovered Wednesday, the Nikkei stock index fell
893.41 points to 27615.73, its lowest level in nearly two
years.
   Among other currencies, investors sought out those of
nations with high domestic interest rates. The Canadian,
Australian and New Zealand dollars and the British pound all
saw buying interest.
   "People are waiting for all this to blow over. A lot of
people are going for the high yields, because they don't want
to take a risk on the dollar," said Robin Cheung, a New York
vice president for Unibank. "They know these currencies won't
be hurt too much by the situation in the Middle East."
   However, the pound was trading slightly lower against the
dollar late in the day, declining to $1.8680 from $1.8696
late Wednesday.
   The dollar ended European dealings mostly weaker, although
it cut little fresh ground and moved within relatively narrow
ranges throughout the day.
   In Tokyo, the dollar finished lower in sluggish dealings
Thursday, with the market's ranks thinned by vacationers.
Those who remained were apparently exhausted by a week of
tension in the Middle East.
   The dollar finished in Tokyo at 149.68 yen, below
Wednesday's close of 150 yen.
   Tokyo foreign-exchange traders said position adjustment
before the peak of the Japanese vacation season next week
could carry the yen higher against European currencies in
coming days.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.80, up $2.60. Estimated volume was a
moderate 3.5 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$387.05 an ounce.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Bechtel Group Inc. said it is continuing
operations and keeping business offices open, while providing
charter flights from Saudi Arabia to London for any employees
or family members who wish to leave.
   In Saudi Arabia, Bechtel, a privately held
engineering-construction concern, has an $80 billion
petrochemical complex under construction in the industrial
city of Jubail, 150 miles from the Kuwaiti border, and is
working on the King Fahd International Airport construction
project. Some 1,200 employees are employed on the two
projects.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A company spokesman said that one chartered airliner with
about 100 people left Saudi Arabia late Wednesday night and
arrived in London early yesterday morning.
   Two planeloads of Bechtel employees or their family
members -- about 200 people -- have left since the company
began providing transport. Others have left on commercial
flights booked by the company.
   The company, which has worked on projects in the Middle
East for nearly 50 years, said it is monitoring the situation
on a 24-hour basis and receiving information and advice from
the U.S. State Department and the British Foreign Service.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. effort to isolate Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein gained ground, but fears mounted for Americans
and other foreigners in Iraq.
   Iraq's military threat to Saudi Arabia remained worrisome
but showed signs of stabilizing, and the Bush administration
gave its strongest signal yet that it's prepared to use a
naval blockade to stop Iraqi exports. And speculation grew
that an Arab meeting postponed until today in Cairo could
consider a negotiated solution under which Iraq would
withdraw from Kuwait in return for huge financial and other
concessions from the Kuwaitis.

   Iraq was set back when the two Arab nations that have
appeared sympathetic to the invasion of Kuwait appeared to
abandon it. Yemen voted in the United Nations Security
Council to approve unanimously a resolution rejecting Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait. And Jordanian officials indicated to
diplomats they will abide by a U.N. trade embargo of Iraq --
potentially helping to cut off food imports.
   U.S. satisfaction with these diplomatic advances was
tempered by the inability of most foreigners to leave Iraq or
Kuwait. The official Iraqi position is unclear, but the
nation appears to be refusing to let non-diplomatic
foreigners leave, and 38 Americans remain in a Baghdad hotel.
   The Bush administration doesn't consider the Americans to
be hostages and is gratified that they seem to be receiving
the same treatment as other foreigners. But these and other
Americans could become pawns in a prolonged U.S.-Iraqi
standoff. Another group of Americans, including some
government officials, were turned back when they tried to
drive across the Iraqi-Jordanian border, and some 3,000
Americans are in Kuwait.
   Iraq continued to fortify its positions on the
Kuwait-Saudi border, but U.S. and diplomatic officials said
they saw no significant preparations for an invasion. A
senior Bush administration aide estimated that Iraq, with an
estimated 120,000 soldiers in Kuwait, could invade with less
than a day's preparation. Saddam Hussein moved some forces
from central Iraq south toward Kuwait. But officials
interpret the movements as efforts by Iraq to consolidate
positions it holds.
   While the U.S. isn't leading an international naval
blockade to stop Iraqi oil exports, officials said U.S.,
British and French ships are stationed near ports through
which Iraq exports oil and are prepared to stop shipments
should customers resume purchases of Iraqi crude. Reuters
news service said Australia is going to send two guided
missile frigates to the Persian Gulf. "I would anticipate
that we would take some steps to interfere with the export of
petroleum products," a senior administration official told
reporters.
   An Iraqi-chartered tanker waiting to be filled with Iraq's
oil outside the Saudi Arabian Red Sea port of Yanbu continued
to wait, according to oil industry sources. So far, Saudi
authorities have not given it permission to enter the port,
which is the terminus of an export pipeline for Iraqi oil.
   One significant snag continued to impair the U.S. effort
to keep Iraq out of Saudi Arabia while inflicting enough
economic pain to push the nation out of Kuwait. Other Arab
nations haven't agreed to send troops to Saudi Arabia to join
U.S. and British forces. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia want Arab
military support to avoid making the Saudis appear as
instruments of Western will.
   The Arab meeting in Cairo -- called partly to create an
Arab military force to send to Saudi Arabia -- was postponed
when one of Saddam Hussein's top deputies and the exiled emir
of Kuwait, to great surprise, both arrived to attend.
   That led to a series of backroom discussions among Arab
leaders, and some analysts speculated that they might have
been exploring a deal in which Iraq would receive a disputed
oil field, a strategic Kuwaiti island and a big cash payment
from Kuwait's royal family in return for withdrawing. But
Bush administration officials and senior Arab diplomats in
Washington said they hadn't heard of any such deal and
discounted the rumors. One official acknowledged, though,
that the U.S. has worried that some Arabs might be more
tempted to buy off Saddam Hussein rather than push him out of
Kuwait.
   The force in Saudi Arabia could grow through the addition
of more Western troops. France, which has warships in the
Persian Gulf, indicated it would be "sympathetic" to a
request for ground forces, a senior U.S. official said.
   U.S. officials said about 3,000 non-Saudi Arab soldiers
are in Saudi Arabia, including a contingent from nations in
the Gulf Cooperation Council, a gulf defense alliance that
were on routine assignment. Those soldiers will be considered
part of a multinational force.
   After meeting with Turkey's leaders, Secretary of State
James Baker left Ankara optimistic that Turkey would lend
military support. Although plans were still being developed,
the moves could include lifting restrictions on U.S. rights
at NATO air bases in Turkey so they could be used to stage
missions over Saudi Arabia or Iraq.
   "In the event that there were to be full-scale
hostilities, I'm quite confident that we could count on our
allies, the Turks," an administration official told reporters
traveling with the secretary of state.
   To induce the Turks to help militarily -- and to reward
them for their earlier step of shutting down Iraqi pipeline
shipments through Turkey -- Mr. Baker carried a pledge from
the wealthy former rulers of Kuwait to reimburse Turkey for
oil-related losses of as much as $2 billion. Mr. Baker also
pledged U.S. support for loans and loan guarantees from the
World Bank and similar institutions and from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank.
   An Iraqi-U.S. clash remained possible, with Iraq facing a
burgeoning U.S. force in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the
region. About 6,000 U.S. troops are on the ground in Saudi
Arabia, and the numbers are growing rapidly. The U.S. has
told Saudi Arabia it intends to ship in a "minimum deterrent
force" of more than 40,000 troops by the end of the month,
according to Pentagon officials. Only a portion of the troops
will be based in Saudia Arabia, with the rest likely to be in
Turkey and perhaps other Arab nations.
   In the event of an Iraqi invasion, Pentagon plans call for
putting in 100,000 or 150,000 troops, the officials said. And
that intention, according to one senior military official,
"has been conveyed unambiguously through diplomatic channels"
to U.S. allies.
   According to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. actions
have caused Iraq to move to protect its tanks, aircraft and
troops from possible attack. Based on satellite pictures and
Iraqi military communications monitored by the U.S., Iraqi
troops appear to be preparing for a long standoff, military
officials said.
   Only a trickle of reinforcements have moved from Iraq and
Kuwait toward the Saudi border, officials said. The number of
Iraqi tanks and troops in that area hasn't changed.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters that the
Iraqis "seem to be in a defensive posture." Instead of
preparing for an attack, he said, Iraqi generals seem
"determined to hold on to what they have acquired." He added:
"We don't see any movement of {Iraqi} military forces in
reaction" to U.S. actions.
   Bush administration aides declined to say whether the U.S.
will call for a naval blockade to stop Iraqi oil exports,
insisting that international arrangements for enforcing the
U.N. trade sanctions are being negotiated with other nations.
   But officials suggested the U.S. has decided against
declaring a blockade. Nevertheless, the U.S. and allies have
assembled the naval forces needed to stop Iraqi oil shipments
through the Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf. The
U.S. hopes exports will be stopped voluntarily -- but is
signaling that it is prepared to institute a blockade if
necessary.
   Meanwhile, the chances for expanded U.S. arms sales to
Saudi Arabia seemed to be growing. U.S. officials said the
administration had decided to revive a stalled sale of 20
F-15 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia. The sale was held up by
opposition in Congress, but the officials indicated it would
go forward.
   At the same time, Congress began reconsidering its effort
to prohibit arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Air Force
lacks much capability to destroy tanks, and the pilots are
still training to use British-built Tornado attack jets that
the Saudis bought because they could not buy the equivalent
U.S. F-15E.
   Congress has also rejected a sale of advanced infra-red
guided Maverick missiles, the U.S. Air Force's preferred
antitank weapon. Saudi F-5 pilots use an older version of the
Maverick that is guided by television cameras that can't see
through haze or dust and that can't distinguish a camouflaged
tank against the desert floor.
   Congress has also limited the number of older model F-15
fighters the Saudis could have in Saudi Arabia. The limit was
set at 60 in 1987. To reinforce the Saudis, President Bush
declared a national security crisis to waive the restriction.
   Officials in the State and Defense departments said they
were ready to review prior Saudi requests for arms.

   McDonnell Douglas's Joel Smith Leaves
   Transport Aircraft Unit Unexpectedly
   ----

   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Joel Smith, one of the principal
architects of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s so-called "total
quality" manufacturing system, is leaving the company's
troubled transport aircraft division.
   The stunning departure of the 50-year-old vice president
-- which is expected to be announced today -- comes amid
growing complaints by some personnel that the company has
turned its back on the original aims of last year's
reorganization in Long Beach. Specifically, they grouse that
senior managers at McDonnell Douglas are ignoring one of the
key principles Mr. Smith has espoused: teamwork between
white-collar and blue-collar employees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Smith, reached at home yesterday, declined to comment.
   John Capellupo, deputy president of the commercial
jet-building subsidiary here, said Mr. Smith has "chosen to
leave" McDonnell Douglas "to complete an advanced degree" at
Pepperdine University.
   Mr. Capellupo insisted that Mr. Smith's departure was not
related to the company's recent statement that it has "made
some mistakes" in the course of its shakeup of operations
here. Still, when asked if Mr. Smith had been forced out, Mr.
Capellupo replied: "The only thing I can say is what I've
told you. I have no other comment on that."
   Mr. Smith arrived at McDonnell Douglas's St. Louis
headquarters in July 1988, straight from his job as the
United Auto Workers representative at New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc., a venture between General Motors Corp.
and Toyota Motor Corp. The widely studied Nummi venture
builds cars using U.S. workers and Japanese team-oriented
techniques.
   Mr. Smith had been hand-picked by McDonnell Douglas's top
officers to implement such an approach at the aerospace
giant. Profits were faltering as the company struggled to
cope with its status as the Pentagon's No. 1 contractor and a
growing backlog of commercial work that was choking the
production lines in Long Beach.
   Mr. Smith was transferred to Long Beach in February 1989
as part of a reorganization. He quickly became the chief
spokesman for McDonnell Douglas's "Total Quality Management
System," touting how supervisors and rank-and-file employees
could join together to cut costs by reducing the amount of
extensive reworking necessary to correct defects caught late
in the manufacturing process.
   However, the company had a loss of $222 million here last
year, and has been running a deficit of $117 million through
the first six months of 1990, much of that because of
development expenses on the MD-11 tri-jet.
   Last month, McDonnell Douglas announced that it was
eliminating up to 17,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting
drive, including 8,000 slots in Long Beach.
   Richard Rios, the newly named president of UAW Local 148,
which represents about 20,000 hourly workers at the Long
Beach unit, said he has sensed an increasing level of
acrimony between his members and their managers of late. "The
company keeps saying that we better get on board first" to
ensure the success of the total-quality effort, he said. "But
I think the company has to get on board first. . . . Our
members feel like they're getting slapped in the face."
   Mr. Capellupo maintained that McDonnell Douglas "continues
to be dedicated to total-quality management," including the
involvement of the union and its workers.

   U.S. Files Charges in Insider-Trade Case
   Involving Ex-Scadden Takeover Lawyer

   NEW YORK -- The government filed civil and criminal
charges against an alleged insider-trading ring that received
information from a Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom
takeover lawyer in more than two dozen transactions.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan charged Steven L. Glauberman,
a former associate in the New York office of Skadden Arps,
with disclosing inside information to Eben Putnam Smith, then
a broker in the Stamford, Conn., office of Smith Barney &amp; Co.
The information allegedly involved about 29 actual or
proposed takeover deals the law firm worked on.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Smith, in turn, allegedly passed the information along
to several others, including Peter H. Jeffer, a former New
York money manager, and Mr. Glauberman's sister, Lori
Glauberman, a former associate director in the preferred
stock department of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. Trading
in these deals, which occurred between February 1984 and
January 1988, netted the participants in the ring more than
$4 million, the government said.
   Mr. Glauberman allegedly continued to pass inside
information to Mr. Smith even after investment bankers Dennis
Levine and Martin Siegel and former stock speculator Ivan F.
Boesky pleaded guilty to insider trading-related charges in
1986 and 1987.
   Mr. Glauberman, 39 years old, Lori Glauberman, 36, and Mr.
Jeffer, 44, have signed consent decrees issued by the SEC
and, without admitting or denying guilt, agreed to pay back
the allegedly unlawful profits they earned from the scheme.
They have also agreed to be permanently barred from the
securities industry.
   Messrs. Glauberman and Jeffer also waived their right to
be indicted by a federal grand jury and were charged in a
five-count document, known as an information. Mr. Glauberman
was charged with four counts of conspiracy, insider trading
and wire fraud. Mr. Jeffer was charged with one count of
insider trading. They haven't pleaded guilty to the criminal
charges, but it is understood that they have agreed to at a
later date.
   Mr. Smith, who was the principal broker at Smith Barney
for Mr. Jeffer's money-management firm, the now-defunct
Jeffer Management Corp., and Stanley Patrick, a trader at
Jeffer Management, were charged in a 10-count indictment
handed up yesterday by a federal grand jury here. The two
were charged with conspiracy and insider trading. According
to the indictment, Mr. Smith provided insider trading tips to
Mr. Patrick, who used the information to buy and sell
securities for his own and client accounts.
   Each of the 15 counts carries a maximum penalty of five
years in jail and a fine of $250,000, which would total about
twice the profits earned through the alleged scheme.
   The SEC first began investigating the alleged trading ring
in 1987. According to a 56-page complaint filed by the SEC in
New York yesterday, Mr. Glauberman, through his job, learned
information about tender offers, mergers, leveraged buy-outs
and other transactions but was obligated to keep the data
confidential.
   Mr. Glauberman met Mr. Smith in 1981, when Mr. Smith
became Mr. Glauberman's broker, and the two became close
friends, according to the SEC complaint. Mr. Glauberman began
giving Mr. Smith inside information concerning deals Skadden
was working on in January 1984, according to the SEC. In the
next five years, Mr. Smith conducted illegal trades based on
the data in as many as eight brokerage accounts he
controlled, the SEC said.
   In exchange for the information he received from Mr.
Glauberman, Mr. Smith put $50,000 into a special trading
account established in April 1985 for Mr. Glauberman's
benefit. That account traded actively but was liquidated in
July 1987, a day after Mr. Glauberman and his sister received
subpoenas to testify before the SEC staff, according to the
SEC.
   Mr. Glauberman allegedly gave Mr. Smith information on
deals he and others at Skadden worked on. Among those deals
were General Motors Corp.'s successful 1984 bid for
Electronic Data Systems Inc., in which Skadden represented
GM, and Chesebrough Ponds Inc.'s 1985 offer for Stauffer
Chemical Inc., in which Skadden represented Chesebrough.
   Between 1984 and 1986, Mr. Glauberman also allegedly gave
information on the possible bids for EDS, Signal Cos., Mary
Kay Cosmetics Inc. and other companies to his sister, who
made $19,135 on the transactions, according to the SEC.
   The SEC has also charged Jeffer Management, Anthony
Correra and Mr. Patrick in its complaint. It said Mr. Smith
met Mr. Jeffer in October 1984, and Mr. Smith told Mr. Jeffer
to buy certain securities based on information Mr. Smith
allegedly received from Mr. Glauberman. Mr. Smith allegedly
profited on the commissions from those trades.
   Mr. Correra, a research analyst at Jeffers Management, and
Mr. Patrick, allegedly learned of Mr. Smith's tips and also
began trading for their own accounts through him.
   The SEC said Mr. Correra has agreed to be barred from the
securities industry, but may reapply after four years.
   Earl Yaffa, managing director of Skadden, said the law
firm believes that "we and our clients have been violated."
Mr. Yaffa said, "Steve was a trusted member of our mergers
and acquisitions group, and he understood the policies and
violated the trust we put in him."
   Mr. Glauberman, a graduate of Princeton University and New
York University Law School, joined the law firm in 1981. When
Skadden learned of the investigation in the autumn of 1988,
it told him to leave its offices, but continued to pay him.
The law firm fired Mr. Glauberman in July, when it was told
that he would be charged. Colleagues at Skadden say Mr.
Glauberman insisted throughout the lengthy investigation that
he was innocent.
   Mr. Glauberman didn't return calls, and his attorney
wasn't available to comment. Robert Anello, an attorney for
Mr. Smith, declined to comment. Lawyers for Ms. Glauberman
and for Messrs. Jeffer, Correra and Patrick didn't return
calls.
   A spokesman for Smith Barney, a unit of Primerica Corp.,
said, "The investigation commenced after Mr. Smith left our
firm. We cooperated fully with the SEC in the investigation."
   William McLucas, SEC enforcement chief, said the case was
"the product of years of dogged investigative work and was
put together piece of paper by piece of paper." The probe was
principally led by Eric Seltzer, an SEC branch chief, and
assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen C. Robinson.
   According to individuals familiar with the matter, the
government didn't file criminal charges against Lori
Glauberman as part of its plea pact with her brother.
   Other Skadden clients about which Mr. Glauberman is
accused of revealing inside information include Morgan
Stanley Group Inc., SCA Services Inc., Allied Corp., Pay Less
Drug Stores Northwest Inc. and Blount Inc.
   Legal experts said Skadden isn't likely to bear any
liability for Mr. Glauberman's actions. He had signed a
statement agreeing that he had a duty to keep information
learned at the law firm confidential.
   In 1987, Ilan K. Reich, formerly a partner with Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, pleaded guilty to federal securities
fraud charges in connection with a profit-sharing arrangement
with Mr. Levine. Mr. Reich served time in jail and was
disbarred.

   Successor to Continental Air's Lorenzo
   Predicts Profitability but Gives No Date

   Hollis L. Harris, who succeeded Frank Lorenzo as head of
Continental Airlines, said the carrier will achieve the
consistent profitability that has eluded it, but he wouldn't
predict when.
   "You look at a carrier that has $5.5 billion in revenue,"
said Mr. Harris about Continental, "its service is a good
product and it has among the lowest relative seat-mile costs.
That airline, if we operate efficiently, ought to be able to
make a profit."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 58-year-old Mr. Harris resigned the presidency of
Delta Air Lines earlier this week to become president and
chief executive officer of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.
and head of its airline unit.
   "My goal is to aggressively move forward on a more
streamlined and simplified basis," said Mr. Harris, who
wouldn't be more specific. Asked when the carrier will see
consistent quarterly profit, he simply smiled. "In the
future," he said.
   Mr. Lorenzo, an airline executive who spent much of the
past decade embroiled in high-profile, bitter disputes with
labor, agreed to sell most of his stake in Continental
Holdings to Scandinavian Airlines System and to step down as
chairman and chief executive officer of the Houston-based
airline holding company and as head of Continental.
   "I personally have become a lightning rod for many steps
that were required to build this company to what it is
today," Mr. Lorenzo said at a New York news conference.
   Word that Mr. Lorenzo had vacated his Continental Holdings
posts boosted the company's stock price to $6.25, up $1.75,
on volume of 2.4 million shares in trading on the American
Stock Exchange. The stock has suffered tremendously as the
holding company sustained massive losses, even during some of
the industry's most profitable quarters ever.
   Mr. Lorenzo and Jan Carlzon, president and chief executive
of SAS, said the transaction would take this form: SAS would
acquire, for $21 million -- $10.8 million to Mr. Lorenzo --
all the stock outstanding in Jet Capital, a closely-held
investment vehicle that controls Continental Holdings through
a special class of stock. SAS also will pay Mr. Lorenzo $17
million for various other holdings and options, as well as
three years' salary, or another $2.7 million. SAS also will
pay $31.4 million to buy 2,250,000 Continental Holdings
shares.
   All told, SAS will increase its equity stake in
Continental Holdings to 16.8% from the current 9.9%. Its
voting control will be 18.4%. Federal law bars foreign
ownership of a U.S. airline of more than 25%.
   SAS would increase its representation on the 15-member
Continental Holdings board to three from one. Mr. Carlzon
would remain on the Continental board, and said he is
considering a post as its chairman, but with no operational
duties.
   The U.S. Transportation Department, which must approve the
transaction, has already requested additional financial
information. Securities analysts, however, expressed optimism
that the transaction will be cleared. They suggested that
Continental's case is helped by Mr. Lorenzo's unpopularity in
Washington, where he has been denounced by a number of
congressmen for his acriminous relations with labor unions.
   Richard Hillman, vice president, flight operations, at
Continental, confirmed for the carrier's pilots early
yesterday a story in The Wall Street Journal that said Mr.
Lorenzo was leaving. He added that Mr. Lorenzo "decided the
future of the company would be better served if he got his
name out of it."
   In the recorded message for the carrier's pilots, Mr.
Hillman suggested Mr. Lorenzo's absence might mean a "better
shot" at financing for Continental's multi-billion dollar
plane orders. "We've been having a little trouble getting
some financing for our airplanes," he added.
   A Continental spokesman wouldn't comment specifically on
what Mr. Hillman told the pilots.
   Mr. Harris's defection from Delta surprised many. That
carrier prides itself on a family-like atmosphere that keeps
employees from jumping ship as they often do at other
airlines. All but one of Delta's senior executives have spent
more than 20 years at the company. Under Mr. Lorenzo,
Continental Airlines had seven presidents in as many years.
   Mr. Harris spent 36 years at Delta, rising from gate agent
to president, with stops along the way in engineering,
facilities and flight operations.
   Neither, however, has he been so publicly vilified by
organized labor as was Mr. Lorenzo. Labor difficulties pushed
Eastern Airlines, then a unit of Continental Holdings'
predecessor, Texas Air Corp., into a crippling strike that
put the carrier into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. A
bankruptcy court judge subsequently took control of Eastern
from Mr. Lorenzo and his management team, appointing a
trustee.
   Union leaders who watched as Mr. Lorenzo successfully
vaporized thousands of jobs and slashed wages and benefits to
the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars were celebratory
yesterday. The International Machinists Union, taking note of
a non-compete clause with SAS that keeps Mr. Lorenzo out of
the airlines business for seven years, offered "our
condolences to whatever industry he stalks next."

   Galante Succeeds
   Buziak as President
   Of RCA Records

   NEW YORK -- Bertelsmann AG replaced the president of its
RCA Records label, Robert Buziak, with the head of RCA's
country music division, Joseph Galante. Industry executives
said the move signals a change in strategy at RCA and they
applauded Mr. Galante's business acumen, despite reservations
about his lack of experience in pop music.
   Mr. Galante, 40 years old, has been with RCA since 1971,
and though his background is in finance, he is credited with
signing some of RCA's biggest country stars and turning its
Nashville-based country music division into the most
profitable segment by far. Among other acts, Mr. Galante
signed during the '80s the country band "Alabama," which has
sold more than 40 million albums.

   Mr. Buziak, who couldn't be reached for comment, is said

his four years as president, Mr. Buziak almost completely
rebuilt the RCA artist roster, buying out contracts from a
number of stars past their prime and steering RCA into what
he called "cutting-edge music." Some of the groups he signed
such as "Cowboy Junkies" built up loyal followings and sold
well, but none have become household names.
   RCA insiders said that German media giant Bertelsmann,
which bought RCA in 1986, hasn't been satisfied with Mr.
Buziak's progress in turning the company around.
   "We've made progress in the right direction, but I believe
we need a push to get to the next level," said Michael
Dornemann, chairman and chief executive officer of
Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG), which includes RCA, Arista and
Ariola and operations in 30 countries. He said Mr. Buziak's
departure is "a friendly move. We want to keep his creative
talent but develop a different kind of relationship."
   Mr. Dornemann said that since Bertelsmann acquired RCA,
its market share has risen to about 5.5% of U.S. record
sales, from about 4.5% when it was bought. (RCA's market
share soared even higher several years ago from the movie
soundtrack album, "Dirty Dancing," but that was a temporary
phenomenon.)
   Industry executives say, Mr. Buziak gave RCA a much hipper
image and helped it build a base in the important black music
market by hiring Skip Miller, former president of Motown, in
1988. Mr. Buziak also arranged for RCA to distribute records
for the British label, Jive, which has a number of popular
black artists.
   Executives who reported to Mr. Buziak said he was a very
hands-on manager who didn't delegate decisions about which
acts to hire and how to handle them. Mr. Galante, described
as a capable manager with a down-to-earth manner, doesn't
have any contacts so far in the rock and pop world and says
his style will be different.
   "My strategy is to broaden the base: we have to be deeper
in other segments of the business," said Mr. Galante. "I will
have people under me signing artists. It is my responsibility
to run the business. I'm not professing to be the A&amp;R
{artists and repertoire} guru of the '90s for RCA."

   It's a scenario that sends shivers down the backs of many
homeowners; depressed housing prices for many, many years.
But for some analysts, it's the only possible scenario. And
for a simple reason: Prices are beynd the reach of too many
potential home buyers.
   "Housing prices have gone up a lot faster than people's
income," says Michael Aronstein, a principal at Comstock
Partners Inc. "It's going to take a long time to get them
back in line."
   According to figures compiled by Comstock, the hours of
factory work required to meet monthly mortgage payments have
been, for the past decade, at historical highs. The 1980s,
Mr. Aronstein says, were a transition period -- the
real-estate market was lukewarm, as it moved from hot to
cold. The '90s, he says, will be cold, with price increases
trailing the inflation rate through the decade.
   "Factory workers are highly paid in relation to other
nonprofessional workers," Mr. Aronstein says. "If they can't
buy the average-priced house, who can?"
   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association
of Home Builders, agrees that in some areas of the country --
particularly the Northeast and West Coast -- affordability is
a problem. But he expects that beginning next year, price
increases, adjusted for house-quality changes, will at least
match the inflation rate. His reasoning is also simple: "The
price of housing is linked closely to the cost ofproducing
new housing," he says. "And with the limited supply of land
and land-use controls spreading, prices may rise slightly
above the inflation rate."

   What are the places that make a home buyer shudder? Here's
one way to tell. Of 100 business centers surveyed, these are
teh 10 with the highest average home prices, usually outside
of the core cities. The prices are based on recent sales for
a 2,400-square-foot, eight-room, four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath
home. The cheapest cities: Midland, Texas; Longview, Texas;
and Casper, Wyo.

   Sierra Pacific Resources said market uncertainty has
caused it to cancel the development of the Thousand Springs
electric generation project resulting in a $35 million charge
on the utility's 1990 earnings. The Reno, Nev., utility
holding company posted earnings of $44.9 million, or $2.05 a
share, in 1989.
   Although several purchase proposals were submitted by
potential energy buyers, the company said it was unable to
obtain long-term purchase agreements necessary to sustain the
project, planned for construction in Elko, Nev.

   Sierra Pacific was the project manager and largest
participant in this independent power project. In the past
few weeks, four companies, Bonneville Pacific Corp.; Foster
Wheeler Energy Corp.; The Pittsburgh &amp; Midway Coal Mining
Co.; and Westinghouse Electric Corp. have withdrawn from the
project, company officials said.

   A former Texas thrift official was placed on paid leave
from his job with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. after
he was indicted earlier this week on charges related to the
thrift's failure.
   Milton R. Perry has been employed by the FDIC since 1987,
about a year after his ouster as executive vice president of
the now-failed Lamar Savings Association of Austin, Texas.
Lamar Savings failed in 1986 with about $2 billion in assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Perry was placed on administrative leave Tuesday, the
same day he and five other men, including former Lamar
Savings owner Stanley E. Adams, were indicted on federal
criminal charges related to the alleged misapplication of
$121.1 million in thrift assets.
   An FDIC spokesman said Mr. Perry worked as an account
officer in the FDIC's Houston office, where he managed a
portfolio of loans and investments for the agency.
   The spokesman said Mr. Perry will continue to receive his
government salary while on leave. A specific salary figure
wasn't immediately available, but the spokesman said Mr.
Perry's salary could range from $32,880 to $60,000, depending
on the number of years he worked for the federal government.
   Mr. Perry's civil attorney, Henry Novak Jr. of Austin,
said his client indicated that he wouldn't resign from the
FDIC. "He doesn't feel that he's done anything wrong," Mr.
Novak said.

   Tokyo stocks plummeted on selling by arbitragers and major
brokerage houses, mainly related to the expiration of August
options Thursday, traders said.
   Meanwhile, London shares finished modestly firmer in quiet
trading in what traders termed a session of consolidation
after several days in volatile waters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index, thrust down by large sell orders at
the close from Japan's Nomura Securities and Belgium's
Societe Generale, traders said, finished at the lowest level
in nearly two years. The index of 225 issues was down 893.41
points at 27615.73.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 10.57 points to
close the morning session at 27626.30.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
380 million shares, down from 577 million shares Wednesday.
Decliners outnumbered gainers 623 to 318, while 155 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section retreated 31.61 points, or 1.51%, to 2068.41.
   The second section index rose 22.25 points, or 0.54%, to
4122.94. Volume in the section was estimated at 15 million
shares, up slightly from 14.1 million shares Wednesday.
   Investors remain uncertain on how to participate amid the
crisis in the Middle East, traders said, although some
institutions have been buying sporadically because prices
have fallen substantially since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Small-capital shares were attracting some buying interest
Thursday, seen as an optimistic move by a market in the face
of the Persian Gulf crisis, though several traders said they
think prices on these shares had room to fall even further.
   Although the market isn't yet sure of a bottom for the
indexes, investors have at least accepted that a higher level
for oil prices will remain for some time, likely to put heavy
pressure on consumer prices in Japan and the U.S., one trader
at a U.K. firm said.
   Reflecting broader market uncertainty on developments in
the Middle East and fears of looming inflation, short sellers
were active in the morning, traders said. Some of these short
sellers later bought to cover the borrowed positions.
   But prices didn't recover as the short sellers had
expected, traders said. With futures indexes closing at a
discount to spot indexes Wednesday, arbitrage selling
pressure weighed heavily on cash prices throughout the day.
   Although the arbitrage selling boosted the futures
indexes, on which price movements inspired some straight
buying on both futures and cash indexes, gains couldn't
withstand options expiration-linked brokerage selling,
traders said.
   Because Thursday was August index-options expiration day,
investors holding open positions on put options, particularly
at 28000 points for the Nikkei, would seek to pressure the
index as low as possible in order to gain the widest premium,
traders said.
   At the close, program sell orders on the Nikkei 225 issues
forced prices about an additional 200 points lower, as a lack
of buying to meet the orders flooded the market.
   Other participants could foresee the impact of the sell
orders, placed well in advance of the close, resulting in a
last-minute sell-off by the broader market, one domestic
broker said.
   On the other hand, during the last minutes of futures
trading, which ends 15 minutes after spot trading, futures
were bought higher, shrinking the discount for Topix futures
to cash, and pushing Nikkei futures back to a large premium.
   One futures and options trader at a foreign securities
firm said the premium is just wide enough that there's a
possibility that arbitrage buying on the Nikkei cash index
will occur early Friday.
   Lower Thursday as a result of stabler oil prices were oil
shares such as Teikoku Oil, down 100 yen to 1720 yen (67
cents to $11.48). Nippon Oil fell 30 yen to 1420 yen, while
Mitsubishi Oil fell 50 yen to 1270 yen.
   Steel shares lost gains from Wednesday. Daido Steel fell
39 yen to 790 yen,  Kobe Steel fell 30 yen to 500 yen,
Kawasaki Steel dropped 15 yen to 499 yen, and NKK dropped 26
yen to 500 yen.
   Advantest rose 390 yen to 5800 yen, while Anritsu gained
50 yen to 2270 yen.
   Construction, financial, metal and mining shares were
lower.
   In London, despite a flood of corporate earnings news,
which wasn't particularly optimistic about the state of
corporate profitability for blue chips, dealers said the
market largely overlooked the figures in favor of watching
the Middle East.
   Dealers added that investors headed for the sidelines
until the market's near-term direction could be seen clearer.
And Wall Street's early uninspiring initial performance kept
dealings at a minimum, traders said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index was up
7.4 points to 2244.9. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
gained 4.3 points to 1752.8. Volume was 329.4 million shares,
compared with 429.2 million shares Wednesday.
   Among corporate features, Shell Transport &amp; Trading fell 9
pence to 482 pence (17 cents to $9.01). The U.K. oil giant
said second-quarter profit fell 44% to #563 million, in the
midrange of market forecasts.
   British Petroleum fell 6 pence to 358 pence. The company
said net profit in the second quarter slid 89% on a historic
basis to #53 million, just short of market expectations of
#60 million to #153 million.
   British Telecom advanced 5 pence to 292 pence. Britain's
largest telecommunications concern reported a 17% rise in
first-quarter pretax profit, helped by improved cost controls
and growth in most of its markets.
   Cadbury Schweppes firmed 3 pence to 333 pence. The U.K.
Department of Trade and Industry said it won't refer to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission the company's #125 million
acquisition of  Source Perrier's non-cola soft-drinks
business.
   Meanwhile, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Madrid and Stockholm, lower in Milan, and mixed in
Amsterdam and Brussels. South African gold stocks closed
narrowly mixed.
   Also, stocks closed lower in Taipei, Hong Kong and
Wellington, were mixed in Sydney, higher in Seoul, and little
changed in Manila. Singapore was closed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   Open-Ended HMOs Lure
   Wary to Try Out Plans

<TEXT>
   ENROLLMENT IN open ended HMOs is surging, but the programs
could have a short life span.
   This hybrid type of health maintenance organization first
became popular in the late 1980s as a way of luring more
employees away from traditional, and more expensive,
indemnity insurance plans. As with most HMOs, individuals who
join an open-ended plan are directed to specific doctors and
hospitals. But patients are also allowed -- if they're
willing to pay higher deductibles -- to see doctors outside
the network.
   "It gives them a full-time safety valve," says Martin
Rosen, a vice president at Sanus, a managed-health-care
company based in Fort Lee, N.J. Individuals who join
open-ended plans, he says, are willing to try HMO doctors --
if for no other reason than to save a few dollars.
"Invariably, they find that they like those doctors, that
managed care is OK," he says.
   Sanus has been offering the option for almost two years.
Today, one-quarter of the 600,000 members in its HMO, as well
as the bulk of new members, are enrolled in an open-ended
plan.
   Indeed, says InterStudy, a research firm in Excelsior,
Minn., enrollment in such plans jumped 39% in 1989, compared
with a 3.6% rise at traditional HMOs.
   Some health-care experts, however, predict the programs
could soon become victims of their own success. As more
people accept the idea of HMOs, the open-ended part of
open-ended plans may become superfluous. "Within seven years,
75% to 80% of people will be in a managedcare product," says
Leonard Abramson, president of U.S. Healthcare, Blue Bell,
Pa.
                                                                                                       

   Retiree Health Plans
   Face Big Overhauls
                                                                                                       

   MORE COMPANIES are taking some strong medicine to control
retiree health-care costs.
   About 80% of surveyed companies say they intend to change
their medical plans for retirees in the next two years, says
Hewitt Associates, a benefits consultant in Lincolnshire,
Ill. Many employers, says Hewitt's Gary Laugharn, are being
squeezed by the unrelenting growth in healthcare bills, as
well as by proposed accounting changes requiring companies to
set up huge reserves to fund retiree benefits.
   Vons Cos., for example, offered a generous health plan to
its retirees until recently, providing coverage with
virtually no deductible or premiums. "It was a richer benefit
than what our active employees have," says Dick Gonzales,
director of compensation management at the Los Angeles-based
grocery retailer.
   But on July 1, Vons moved to a system in which retiring
non-union employees will receive a onetime allocation of
credits based on length of service. A person who retires
after 20 years would receive $41,320 in credits; an employee
with 10 years would get $20,660. Those credits will be used
to pay annual premiums -- ranging from $1,400 to $4,000 --
for one of two insurance plans Vons offers.
   Vons's plan now resembles a conventional pension plan,
says Mr. Laugharn, a change more firms are considering. For
Vons's part, Mr. Gonzales estimates the plan could cut
expenses in half under the accounting changes.
                                                                                                       

   Fewer Blank Checks
   To Cover Job Injuries
                                                                                                       

   WORKERS' compensation costs are an increasingly popular
target among companies seeking to hold down medical bills.
   In 1989, employers plowed about $45 billion into workers'
compensation insurance, which provides cash and medical
benefits to workers with job-related injuries or diseases.
That's almost double the figure of a decade earlier. Medical
costs, in particular, have contributed to that growth:
Between 1980 and 1989, the average claim jumped to $3,420
from $1,724, says the National Council on Compensation
Insurance.
   Employers, however, while moving aggressively in the past
decade to hold down costs in conventional health plans,
typically have taken a hands-off attitude toward medical
claims filed under workers' compensation. Because such
programs are governed by state regulations, says Larry L.
Madlem, president and chief executive officer of SouthCare
Medical Alliance, an Atlanta-based managed-care company, many
employers have believed mistakenly that they had little or no
control over medical charges. Some companies, Mr. Madlem
says, don't even bother to review claims under $10,000 -- an
invitation for significant abuse.
   Now, however, companies are starting to apply some tried
and true techniques to hold down costs. Mr. Madlem cites the
example of an Atlanta manufacturer that had lost track of the
physicians used by injured employees. The company simply paid
the bills. Early this year, it adopted a preferred-provider
plan that delivers, among other services, fee schedules and
discounted rates at selected hospitals -- all of which could
cut bills as much as 30%.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   ABOUT 10% of U.S. hospitals are in serious financial
trouble, according to a study by Health Care Investment
Analysts in Baltimore. Of those hospitals, about 200 could
end up closing their doors within three years. The study used
12 guidelines to identify the weakest facilities, including
cash flow and occupancy rates. Illinois, Massachusetts,
Oklahoma and Pennsylvania had large numbers of troubled
hospitals. . . . More than 900,000 cardiac catheterizations
-- the process of examining the heart by passing a tube into
it -- are performed in the U.S. every year. But costs vary
widely, according to Metropolitan Life Insurance. The average
charge is $4,820, but costs range from $3,210 in Wisconsin to
almost $8,000 in California.

   Nordstrom Inc., still grappling with rising costs,
reported profit fell 7% in the second quarter.
   Earnings for the second period, ended July 31, were off 7%
to $35.9 million, or 44 cents a share, from $38.5 million, or
47 cents in the comparable period last year. Costs and
expenses totaled $745.6 million, up nearly 12%, while sales
rose 10% to $801.8 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   John A. Goesling, the Seattle retailer's senior vice
president, said the company isn't "yet satisfied" with its
results. He added, however, that trends in sales and expenses
are "moving in the right direction." Sales increased at a
higher rate and expenses at a lower rate during the second
quarter than the first, ended April 30.
   Mr. Goesling said the company brought its inventories in
line with sales in the second quarter. It also took steps to
cut expenses across the board.
   Profits for the six months, ended July 31, declined 20% to
$49.1 million, or 60 cents a share, from $61.5 million, or 75
cents a share.

   Central Bancshares said the move fits with its strategy of
strengthening its Texas presence. It said after completion of
the acquisition, which is expected to occur in early 1991,
River Oaks will become part of its Houston-based Compass
Bancshares Inc. unit.
   Terms of the agreement call for Compass to buy all of the
outstanding shares of River Oaks for $17.6 million in cash
and $26.4 million in Central Bancshares preferred stock with
a coupon rate of 8%. River Oaks is 62%-owned by James E.
Lyon, its chairman and chief executive, who plans to vote his
shares in favor of the merger, Central Bancshares said.
   River Oaks includes River Oaks Bank, with assets of $403
million, and River Oaks Trust Co., with $686 million in trust

   Highflying Small Stocks Take a Beating

   Oil-Price Worries
   Spark Big Sell-Off

   NEW YORK -- After surging through the first half of the
year, small stocks have been abruptly dumped by investors
unnerved by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The result: Small stocks have suffered their worst
flogging since the 1987 market collapse. And analysts warn
that these over-the-counter issues probably will be the last
ones that investors return to, amid widespread fears of
recession and inflation inspired by the Middle East oil-price
shock.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Why the carnage in small stocks? Doubts that small
companies can withstand the economic fallout from higher oil
prices sent many investors running for cover.
   Small stocks "are often not the industry leaders," so
"it's only natural that the urge to sell them is greater
during a market panic," says Stefan Abrams, chief investment
strategist for Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Even among leading OTC issues, investors have been quick
to take their profits in stocks such as Microsoft Corp., Nike
Inc. and Amgen that had outperformed most bigger stocks.
   After briskly outpacing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock
Index the first half of the year, technology and small-growth
companies -- the stars of the OTC market -- were jettisoned
with ferocity. The Nasdaq Industrial Index, which tracks such
issues, gave up all of its 10.9% first-half gain and is now
down 0.9% for the year.
   Other small stocks suffered a worse beating. The broader
Nasdaq Composite Index, up 1.6% as of June 29, is now 9.2%
lower for the year. Similarly, the Russell 2000 Index, up
0.5% in the first half, has dropped 9.4% for the year.
   By contrast, big stocks have been hurt less. The S&amp;P 500
has slipped 3.8% this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial
Average has edged up 0.2%.
   In the small stock sell-off that ended Monday, investors
thoroughly trounced both the market's established companies
and its newest entrants. From mid-July highs, leaders such as
software maker Microsoft tumbled to 60 1/2 from 79;
semiconductor maker Intel Corp. dove to 37 1/4 from 50;
athletic footwear maker Nike plunged to 72 from 92, and
biotechnology concern Amgen tumbled to 80 1/4 from a high of
92 just nine days earlier.
   Among new issues, Dynasty Classics Corp. fell to 11 from
18 and In-Store Advertising Inc. plunged to 15 from 22 7/8
the day it went public on July 19.
   In the past two days, small stocks have cut their losses,
rebounding along with the broader market. Once again,
technology and growth stocks are leading the OTC recovery.
   Even before the Iraqi invasion, small stocks had begun to
crumble as some technology and other companies began to turn
in disappointing earnings.
   Often, "there was more speculation than solid earnings
themes," particularly in the technology and health-care
sectors, says Charles I. Clough, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s chief
investment strategist. "Once that became visible, the market
came apart."
   Exacerbating the plunge in smaller stocks were worries
about liquidity, or the ability to sell shares quickly.
Investors concerned about liquidity often dump shares of
thinly traded small companies first. Brokerage firms also
haven't been as willing to commit their capital to make
markets in OTC stocks after posting huge losses in thinly
traded shares in the 1987 crash.
   "Once liquidity disappears, you see air pockets open up
underneath companies without real products or prospects,"
says Mr. Clough. "What really was surprising," he adds, "was
how dramatic the recent fall was. It speaks to the fact that
there's not a lot of liquidity in that marketplace."
   That's not likely to improve, analysts say. "In today's
world of tight times on Wall Street, there isn't going to be
much liquidity" for smaller stocks, says Greg Smith,
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. investment strategist. Mr.
Smith says the lack of liquidity in small stocks is the
problem that most concerns him.
   As dealers remain reluctant to bid for small stocks, some
institutions say they're turning to alternative trading
systems. Jack Laporte, portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price &amp;
Co.'s $1 billion New Horizons Fund, says the mutual fund
company has experimented with trading on such computerized
services as Instinet, a unit of Reuters PLC, which
automatically match buyers and sellers.
   "The Street has not done a good job in its market-making
and stabilizing function," says Mr. Laporte, who complains
about the difficulty of finding bids from OTC dealers during
the recent stock market decline.
   Monday, for instance, prices in smaller stocks were marked
down by dealers regardless of whether there was any real
selling interest, some portfolio managers say.
   That doesn't mean that portfolio managers have given up on
smaller stocks. Mr. Laporte is among those who continue to
expect small growth stocks to outperform larger shares, even
in a recession.
   But others say that small stocks will have a slow
comeback. "As people get their courage back and move back
into equities, these issues {small stocks} will lag," says
Kidder's Mr. Abrams. "First, money flows into the big,
liquid, unblemished leaders," he explains, pointing to this
week's recoveries in big issues such as Merck &amp; Co., Procter
&amp; Gamble Co. and, PepsiCo Inc.
   "That's the knee-jerk response," he adds. "You can get
money to work quickly, and you can get it to work in
problem-free companies."

   Kleinwort Benson Group PLC, a British merchant bank, said
pretax profit for the half year to June 30 was little
improved from the year-earlier period at #30.3 million ($56.7
million) after bad-debt provisions and a downturn in its
mergers and acquisitions business in the U.K.
   Pretax profit in the latest half was up only 0.7% from the
year-earlier period's #30.1 million. The results were weaker
than most market forecasts and were seen as a sign of
particular weakness given that first-half 1989 profit was
hurt by a number of factors, including #8 million in losses
associated with now discontinued operations in Australia and
the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "These results should be seen against a very different
background to that which prevailed during the comparable
period last year," Kleinwort Chairman David Peake warned.
"Income from the United Kingdom mergers and acquisitions
activity was much lower and conditions in the Japanese equity
markets were unfavorable."
   Profit after tax, or net profit attributable to
shareholders, fell 7% to #19.4 million from #20.9 million a
year earlier. There weren't any extraordinary items in the
latest period, although the year-earlier net profit was
helped by an extraordinary gain of #3.7 million from
disposals.

   HOLLYWOOD -- Forgive Walt Disney shareholders if they feel
as if they're trapped at a never-ending screening of
"Iraqnophobia." The Mideast oil trauma has been buffeting
Disney's stock, and not because film is a petroleum-based
product, either. Disney shares rise and fall not on
moviemaking, but on theme parks, where the company raked in
64% of its pre-tax operating profit last year.
   The attendance-shrinking potential of higher gasoline
prices has escalated a decline in the stock that was touched
off last month by fears of a weakening economy. So hard has
this once-loved stock fallen that now, even as several
analysts lower their near-term earnings estimates, a fellow
at Goldman Sachs is renewing a "buy" recommendation, citing
Disney's long-term strengths.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Disney shares plunged
12% to 102 3/8 Monday. They have recovered a bit since and
yesterday closed at 109 3/4, up 1 3/4, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   The shares began eroding from their mid-130s peak even
before analysts began to worry that higher prices at the
gasoline pump and the airline ticket counter would hurt
attendance at Disney's Florida and Southern California parks.
Disney hasn't released theme-park attendance figures since
new management took over in 1984, raising ticket prices
aggressively and making the stock a Wall Street favorite.
   The company says it guards the numbers "because Wall
Street overreacts in the short term." But Disney executives
have conceded to analysts that attendance at the parks has
been flat this summer, even before gasoline-price boosts.
   "Two factors generate theme-park attendance: a strong
economy and new attractions," says First Boston's Jessica
Reif, who Monday downgraded her longstanding "buy"
recommendation to a hold. "The economy is weak, and Disney
has no new major attractions planned domestically for several
years."
   Ms. Reif adds that during the 1973-74 oil embargo, Disney
World attendance dropped 6% and Disneyland was off 4.5%; in
1979, attendance again fell in response to rising oil prices
and stayed weak through 1982.
   "But that was a different Disney," counters analyst
Raymond Katz of Shearson Lehman Hutton. "Walt Disney World
was brand new and it wasn't a `destination' resort. . . .
There were no consumer products or filmed entertainment to
speak of" at the company.
   Disney still has a hot hand in movies. "Pretty Woman" is
the year's biggest hit, and for the third year in a row
Disney will rank near the top among studios in terms of
market share. "Dick Tracy" may not have been as big as Disney
had hoped, but it still grossed $100 million. "Three Men and
a Little Lady" and a re-released "Fantasia" come out this
fall.
   These hits will pay off even more for Disney when they
reach the company's video executives, who dominate the
growing "sell-through" business -- pricing cassettes
sufficiently low that consumers will buy them rather than
rent them. Disney's merchandise-packed stores continue to
grow and its prototype restaurant, Mickey's Kitchen, is off
to good start and appears likely to be expanded.
   Disney stock also tumbled late last year, and Goldman's
Richard Simon at the time slapped a "hold" sticker over his
buy rating maintained since 1985. The shares dropped 23%
between November and early February, then revived to hit an
intraday high of 136 1/2 last month, or 22 times earnings.
The stock now is at less than 19 times trailing earnings.
   Because of the stock dip, Goldman's Mr. Simon reinstituted
his buy recommendation Tuesday, even as he lowered his
earnings estimate. "The current price has more than adjusted
for the risks in light of a very favorable long-term
environment," he says.
   The shares fell briefly Wednesday after newswires reported
that Morgan Stanley's Alan Kassan believed Disney had put
long-term stock buy-back plans on hold and was contemplating
a major acquisition, such as either CBS or MCA. Disney
declined to comment, but analysts said the company has been
casting cold water on the talk. Neither rumored target is
new. Disney is indeed thought to be interested in buying a TV
network, particularly if the government's financial-interest
rules wither away this year. But the company is a bottom
fisher and some think CBS might be too pricey. With MCA,
analysts warn of antitrust problems. Besides, the companies
don't like each other.
   "There's a better chance of George Bush and Saddam Hussein
going out for a beer," says Shearson's Mr. Katz, "than for
Michael Eisner and {MCA President} Sid Sheinberg to sit down
in a room together."

of yesterday.
   The Los Angeles insurance holding company said that under
terms of the offer, participating shareholders must sell all
their eligible shares. Argonaut said that for each share
owned it will pay holders the highest closing price of
Argonaut common between Aug. 21 and Sept. 25.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Argonaut said it is making the offer mainly to allow
smaller shareholders to sell their shares without being
charged any brokerage commission. A reduction in the number
of small shareholder accounts also would reduce the company's
administrative costs.
   Many shareholders received their shares in 1986 when
Teledyne Inc. spun off Argonaut to Teledyne shareholders.
Argonaut said that Shareholder Communications Corp. will
manage the offer, which is set to expire Sept. 25.

   FEARS MOUNTED for Americans and other foreigners in Iraq
and Kuwait.
   Despite an unclear official Iraqi position, Baghdad
appeared to be refusing to let nondiplomatic foreigners
leave, and 38 Americans remained detained in a Baghdad hotel.
One group of Americans were turned back when they tried to
cross the Iraqi-Jordanian border. Some 3,000 Americans are
still in Kuwait, and nearly 600 in Iraq. The U.S. said that
it doesn't consider the Americans to be hostages and
expressed gratification that their treatment didn't seem to
differ from that of other foreigners.

   Arab leaders in Cairo delayed a meeting on the crisis
until today as speculation grew that they may consider a
solution under which Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait in
return for financial concessions from the Kuwaitis. The U.N.
Security Council unanimously declared Iraq's annexation of
Kuwait void, and Baghdad also apparently lost the support of
Yemen and Jordan. Iraq fortified its positions on the
Kuwaiti-Saudi border, but the U.S. didn't detect preparations
for an invasion.
   The U.S. gave its strongest signal yet that it is prepared
to use a naval blockade to stop Iraqi oil exports. U.S.,
British and French vessels were stationed in the Persian Gulf
region.

said. The Ministry of Health and Welfare imposed an average

   Overall sales also were pushed down by a sharp drop in
sales of the Tokyo-based company's largest selling drug,
Picibanil, an injectable immunological cancer agent. Its
sales declined 60% following the government's decision in
December to restrict the range of cancers for which Picibanil
can be used and to allow its use only in conjunction with
other anti-cancer drugs.

   Treasury's 30-Year Auction Finds Good Response
   Due to Lure of Highest Yields Since May 1989

   NEW YORK -- After shunning the first two segments of the
Treasury's $32.25 billion quarterly securities auction,
investors were lured to the final segment of the auction by
the highest yields in more than a year.
   The Treasury auctioned $10.26 billion of 30-year bonds
yesterday as it completed its three-part refunding of the
federal debt. The 30-year bonds had an average yield of
8.87%, the highest yield for a benchmark bond since May 1989
when the average yield was 9.11%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In when-issued trading, the yield slipped to 8.75%, a sign
that the 30-year bonds were selling briskly and at hefty
premiums in the secondary market.
   Cheered by the successful completion of the quarterly
refunding, the bond market rallied. The old benchmark 30-year
bond ended about 3/4 point higher, a gain of about $7.50 for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
   William Brachfeld, manager of trading in the New York
office of Japan's Daiwa Securities America Inc., said that
investors pushed aside worries about Mideast turmoil and
rising oil prices and purchased bonds in an apparent bet that
interest rates will soon head lower.
   The auction went smoothly despite scant interest on the
part of Japanese investors, who have purchased anywhere from
25% to 50% of the 30-year bonds sold at previous auctions.
Mr. Brachfeld estimates that long-term Japanese investment
accounts may have purchased between 5% and 10% of the 30-year
bond at yesterday's auction.
   "The demand from Japan continues to be quite small," said
Mr. Brachfeld. "This was not a Japanese auction, this was a
domestic auction." Japanese investors have been reducing
their purchases of U.S. securities for most of the year,
primarily because they view securities in their own market as
equally or more attractive than U.S. securities.
   The auction results were a surprise to some market
participants, many of whom had predicted that the 30-year
bond auction would be by far the weakest of the Treasury's
three auctions. As it turns out, the 30-year was the
strongest.
   The quarterly auction kicked off Tuesday with the sale of
$11.5 billion of three-year notes and continued on Wednesday
with the sale of $10.5 billion of ten-year notes. The first
sale was considered lackluster and the second sale was viewed
as a disaster, although demand for the notes picked up in the
secondary market late Wednesday as prices fell and yields
rose to levels considered attractive.
   Stephen G. Thieke, manager of the government trading desk
at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., said that political news
developments and rumors of developments disrupted the two
early auctions and made it difficult for dealers to assess
investor interest. (Any institution or individual can bid on
bonds at a Treasury auction, although most of the bonds are
acquired by Wall Street brokerage firms and large commercial
banks. Individuals usually buy securities through so-called
noncompetitive tenders.)
   But after the market fell sharply after Wednesday's
auction, investors suddenly materialized. At that point, "you
saw a greater sense of confidence on the part of the dealer
community about where yields had to be to attract investors
in this climate," said Mr. Thieke.
   In addition to the price gain of the old benchmark 30-year
bond, other aspects of the sale also confirmed that the
auction went smoothly. The bid-to-cover ratio -- a measure of
the amount of bids received compared with the amount of
securities sold -- was 2.53, reflecting a healthy interest in
the new bonds.
   The Treasury received bids totaling $25.96 billion,
including $505 million of noncompetitive tenders at the
average yield, up from $463 million of noncompetitive bids
accepted at the previous 30-year bond auction on May 10.
   Now that the record $32.25 billion quarterly refunding
obstacle has been hurdled, the focus of the Treasury market,
likely will return to economic fundamentals, analysts say.
   The crisis in the Mideast and its effects on world-wide
oil prices and inflation will remain at center stage, but
slumping real estate and stock prices, rising unemployment
and tightening credit conditions also will be a focus of
concern, analysts say.
   The outlook for Friday is cautious. Analysts say that
while the optimism that swept through the market late
Thursday may carry over through the night, the market will
remain captive to any new events surrounding the conflict
with Iraq.
   The producer price index for July is scheduled for release
this morning at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The report is expected to show
a 0.1% rise in producer prices, up 0.2% if the volatile food
and energy components are excluded, according to a Dow Jones
Capital Markets Report survey of economists.

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasurys rallied after the government completed its
$32.25 billion quarterly refunding of the federal debt.
   The old benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price
of 99 26/32, up from 99 3/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield,
which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to
8.75% from 8.82% on Wednesday.
   The new ten-year notes ended at a price of 100 26/32 to
yield 8.64%, down from Wednesday's average auction yield of
8.77%. New three-year notes were quoted at a price of 99
22/32 to yield 8.10%, the same as the average yield set at
Tuesday's auction.
   In addition to 30-year bonds, the Treasury sold $10
billion of 36-day cash management bills yesterday.
   Here are details of yesterday's cash management bill
auction and the 30-year bond auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A strong performance by the stock market helped boost
confidence in the junk-bond market, driving prices of
better-quality speculative-grade issues higher.
   Overall, prices of blue chip high-yield names ended the
session about 1/4 point higher. Investment-grade corporate
bonds also advanced with long-term corporate bonds flagging
gains of about 5/8 point.
   The junk bonds of Texas Air Corp., now Continental
Airlines Holdings Inc., skyrocketed on news that Frank
Lorenzo, chairman and chief executive, will step down and
will sell most of his direct and indirect investment in
Continental to Scandinavian Airlines System.
   Texas Air's 15.75% senior notes, maturing in 1992, shot up
about eight points in over-the-counter trading to end at a
bid price of 89. Eastern Airlines, a unit of the airline
company, saw the fortunes of its preferred stock rise.
   Eastern Airlines' Series D preferred stock rose 3 1/8
points, or 31.6%, to close at 13 in over-the-counter
composite volume of 193,500 shares. Average daily volume in
the issue is about 17,900 shares. The issue was as high as 14
1/2 earlier in the day.
   Meanwhile, some recently-depressed junk-bond issues like
R.H. Macy &amp; Co. and Trump Plaza Funding Corp. continued to
show signs of strain, and lost between 1/2 and 1 point.
   In the new-issue market for investment-grade corporate
debt, about $450 million in new securities were priced
Thursday, including a $250 million floating-rate note
offering by the Student Loan Marketing Association.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Reacting to the stronger-than-expected demand seen at the
Treasury's 30-year bond auction, municipal issues ended
steady to 1/2 point higher, with some issues posting gains of
3/4 point.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% of 2018 were up 1/2 point at 98
1/2 to yield 7.32%.
   Despite the market's gains, participants remain cautious
due to the volatile situation in the Middle East.
   No large new municipal issues are expected to be priced
today.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended as much as 3/4 point higher in a
rally that followed the Treasury's 30-bond auction.
   In the primary market, a $300 million Federal National
Mortgage Association real estate mortgage investment conduit
issue backed by 10% Fannie Mae 30-year securities was offered
by Lehman Brothers.
   Also, there was a $300 million issue of Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. Remics backed by Freddie Mac 9.5% 30-year
securities offered through Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp.
   There was also a $500 million Freddie Mac Remic backed by
Freddie Mac 9% 30-year securities offered through Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   In the secondary market, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues were up 5/8 point at 99 1/32, Freddie
Mac 9.5% issues were 15/32 higher at 98 21/32 and Fannie Mae
9.5% issues were 15/32 stronger at 99 6/32.
   In the asset-backed sector, there was a two-part Chrysler
Financial Corp. offering totaling around $215 million.
   One of those was a $139 million Grantor Trust issue backed
by marine receivables.
   The other was a $75 million Grantor Trust issue backed by
recreational-vehicles receivables.
   Both issues are offered through Chemical Securities Inc.,
a unit of Chemical Banking Corp. Both issues had a coupon
rate of 8.90% and were priced at 99 41/64 to yield 9.072%.
   The originator and servicer of the underlying loans in
both trusts is Chrysler First Inc. Both Chrysler First Inc.
and Chrysler Financial Corp. are units of Chrysler Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government-bond market ended softer yesterday
in its first subdued trading session in a week.
   Participants in the financial markets say they have grown
more accustomed to the tension in the Middle East, so that
dealings were less vulnerable to rumors about the stand-off
between Iraq and now the U.S.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
price of Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was 83.44,
down 0.47 point. The yield was 7.99%. (When calculated using
the semi-annual compound method, the closing yield on the No.
119 bond was 7.37%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   Elsewhere:
   -- West German bonds ended 0.35 point firmer in light
trading. The bulk of the day's gains came on overnight
short-covering, dealers said.
   -- British government bonds, called gilts, ending firmer
as the high yields on the securities have begun to attract
investors. Britain's benchmark 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 was
quoted late at 99 17/32, up 19/32 from late Wednesday to
yield 11.80%.

   Avnet Inc., after taking a restructuring charge, reported
fiscal fourth-quarter net income fell 62%.
   The maker of industrial and consumer products said net
income was $7.5 million, or 22 cents a share, after the $9.8
million charge. Year-earlier net was $19.8 million, or 55
cents a share.

   Sales for the quarter ended June 30 were $447.9 million,
down from the year-earlier $456.9 million.
   For the fiscal year, the New York firm said net income
rose to $56.5 million, or $1.57 a share, from $54 million, or
$1.51 a share. Sales were $1.75 billion, down from $1.92
billion. Year-ago results included a gain of $1.3 million on
the sale of four operations.
   The company said the restructuring charge includes costs
related to the disposition of its Taiwanese operation and
restructuring of its Avnet Computer Technologies and Harper
S.I.D operations.
   Avnet Chairman Leon Machiz said that, despite the 9%
decline in fiscal-year sales, earnings from operations,
excluding the charge, rose 26%. Net operating margins
increased to 3.8% from 2.7%.

   Showa Denko K.K., Japan's fourth largest integrated
chemical company, said unconsolidated pretax profit fell 14%
in its first half to 14.92 billion yen ($99.6 million) from
17.27 billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income rose 7.9% to 8.15 billion yen, or 7.85 yen a

   Net income increased as the company's corporate and
residential tax burden slipped to 5.66 billion yen from 8.11
billion yen a year earlier. Sales edged up 1.5% to 265.25
billion yen from 261.32 billion yen.
   A Showa Denko official said the company was hurt by rising
naphtha prices. He also cited rising research and development
costs for dragging down pretax profit.
   Sales in the petrochemical category, accounting for 46% of
overall sales, rose 3.4% to 122.1 billion yen from 118.07
billion yen. Sales of ceramics, aluminium and other products,
accounting for 35% of total sales, totaled 93.88 billion yen,
a 1.8% slip from 95.55 billion yen.
   The company plans to pay a mid-term dividend of 3 yen,
compared with 2.5 yen a year earlier.
   For the year, the company sees sales rising to 530 billion
yen from 525.47 billion yen. Pretax profit is expected to be
30 billion yen with net at 15 billion yen.

   Commodities:
   Copper Futures Surge Early but Close Mixed
   As Profit-Taking Hits Longer-Term Contracts

   NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices ended mixed as late
profit-taking trimmed strong early advances.
   Only the nearest months ended with gains, though all
traded contracts set life-of-contract highs before sagging.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   August delivery copper settled at $1.3250 a pound, up 1.50
cents for the day, after trading as high as $1.3420.
September, the most active contract, was up 1.10 cents to
$1.3205. Meanwhile, December was unchanged at $1.2295, and
deliveries from January onward fell by amounts ranging from
0.10 cent to 0.50 cent a pound.
   John Gross, president of J.E. Gross &amp; Associates, a New
City, N.Y., copper industry consulting firm, said the roots
of the copper market's current behavior go back to June, when
traders and the industry generally were looking for slower
consumption, lower prices and a typical summer slowdown.
"Short-selling was induced by the negative sentiment" back
then, he said, and copper consumers held back on buying in
expectation of lower prices.
   During late June and in July, a "counterseasonal" rally
developed, Mr. Gross said, triggered by threats of a miners'
strike in Peru and problems in Chile, the world's leading
producer. Workers at Codelco, Chile's state-owned copper
company, staged a slowdown in a labor dispute, and there was
a rock burst at one of Codelco's large mines, El Teniente.
   These developments stimulated some demand for futures
contracts, which in turn triggered further buying on
technical considerations as prices rose, according to Mr.
Gross.
   "From that point on, the buying can really be considered
an extension of that technical demand, since no new
fundamental factors have appeared," he said.
   There is a widespread perception that demand for copper is
strong in Japan and Germany, Mr. Gross said. "If that is
true, why is it that stocks of copper in London Metal
Exchange warehouses continue to rise?" he asked.
   Those inventories have more than doubled since July 1 to
107,775 tons, he said. "This is a confusing element in an
otherwise strong fundamental picture," he said. "A case can
be made that Europe is on vacation, but that wouldn't account
for a stocks increase of that size."
   Now, Mr. Gross said, with New York futures prices
establishing new highs daily, if they rise above yesterday's
closings in a "meaningful" way, "they could continue to
advance."
   Another price-supporting factor, Mr. Gross said, is that
the supply of copper in Commodity Exchange warehouses is less
than would be needed to satisfy all August futures contracts
outstanding. Exchange inventories of copper amounted to 7,798
tons yesterday, and there were 881 August contracts
outstanding for a total of 11,013 tons. Most futures
contracts are nullified by an offsetting trade before they
mature.
   "You can't rule out continued strength in the August
contract based on concern over the supply delivery situation
on the Comex," Mr. Gross said.
   There also has been short-covering -- or the buying back
of contracts by traders who previously sold short in
anticipation of a price decline -- as well as options-related
buying of futures, another analyst said. The markets were
also bolstered by Japanese buying of copper early in the day,
he said, as well as by falling oil prices and a stronger
stock market.
   This analyst also said the Middle East situation was less
tense than on Wednesday, "although it can blow up at any
minute."
   Fundamentally, nothing has really changed in the past five
weeks, one dealer said, but the market continues to make new
highs. Consequently, all the answers as to where prices are
going seem to be based on technical considerations, he said.
   "All technicians are saying that the market will continue
to rise based on chart formations," he said, referring to
pricechart patterns that some traders use to foretell market
moves. This is an important assessment, he said, because most
of the gains recently have been spurred by technically
oriented traders, not by those whose trading is based on
fundamental factors.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices for cattle futures deliverable
this month rose on a pick-up in wholesale demand. But an
increase in private analysts' estimates of the number of
cattle put on feedlots in July depressed prices for futures
contracts deliverable next year. August live cattle futures
gained 0.77 cent a pound to close at 78.77 cents. Next
Friday, the Agriculture Department will release its estimates
of the number of cattle on feedlots as of Aug. 1. Charles
Levitt, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
Chicago, said he expects the figures to show at least a 5%
increase. Cattle are placed on feedlots to be fattened in
preparation for marketing. With traders reacting to an
expected increase in supplies coming off the feedlots and
into the market early next year, February live cattle futures
dropped 0.27 cent a pound to close at 76.52 cents.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were higher. December
delivery gold was up $2.60 an ounce to $394.80. September
silver advanced 1.3 cents an ounce to $4.8830. October
platinum ended with a gain of $4.80 at $486.90. Dinsa Mehta,
chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank, said one reason
that gold has shown strength over the past week and has
resisted significant declines is "a reluctance of traders to
hold short positions." A short sale is a sale made in
anticipation of declining prices. At the moment, there is
clear justification for the gold market to hold in the
$380-an-ounce range, he said, and there is no indication that
the market is going to "run away and shoot up to $400."
Although the market's principal support is coming from the
Mideast crisis, any drop in oil shipments from that area can
be made up elsewhere, and this is restraining the buying of
gold, according to Mr. Mehta. Moreover, he said, the
situation could turn into an impasse, which would diffuse the
tension. "In that case, gold prices could drift lower," he
said. Bruce Kaplan, president of Kaplan Co., a Santa Monica,
Calif., precious metals consulting firm, said the advance in
platinum was "mostly a correction" to bring the price into a
"realistic alignment" with gold. Platinum usually trades at
about $100 an ounce above gold, he said, but recently that
differential had narrowed.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices eased. The September contract ended
with a loss of $9 a metric ton at $1,120. Traders focused on
reports of improved weather in the Ivory Coast, the world's
largest producer, an analyst said. There has been some rain
recently, and the pod count has looked good despite earlier
dry weather. A further supply build-up is expected from the
1990-91 crop, while demand, particularly from Eastern
European countries that were good buyers last year, may
decline because of financial problems, the analyst said. en

   First Executive Told
   To Disclose Reports
   Made by Consultant

   A New York state court rejected an effort by First
Executive Corp. to keep secret details of two reports by a
consultant that the insurance holding company has maintained
are favorable to it.
   The decision by Justice Eugene Nardelli removed a
temporary restraining order that has prevented the New York
Department of Insurance from releasing the reports. Unless
overturned, the decision may make the reports public by the
end of the week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The judge held that First Executive had failed to show
"any valid reason" to delay publication of the reports by
consulting actuaries Milliman &amp; Robertson and that there is a
public interest in the material that impels its release.
   First Executive said it will appeal the ruling. A
spokesman said that the Los Angeles-based company has planned
to release the reports with updated information and needs
time to prepare it -- an argument that Judge Nardelli
rejected in court as "unconvincing."
   First Executive has over time disclosed selected portions
of the reports, even touting to Congress the reports'
conclusions that the company's Executive Life Insurance Co.
unit can withstand a variety of adverse financial
circumstances. Oddly, however, it has failed to make the
entire reports public, encouraging doubts that First
Executive may have been selective in its disclosures.
   The reports have been sought under state freedom of
information laws by Joseph Belth, who is the publisher of a
monthly newsletter, "Insurance Forum," and a frequent critic
of First Executive. Mr. Belth, a professor of insurance at
the University of Indiana, said "we had a very strong case
for disclosure and the judge obviously agreed with us."

   ...And If the West Shames Him, He Will Fall

   Saddam Hussein is ready to kill and invade wherever he
judges that it is in his interest to do so. Anyone in the
least doubt about his ruthlessness has only to remember how
he gassed the Kurds in his own country. If he could realize
his threats to Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf, to
Jordan and to "burn Israel," then he would do so without
hesitating.
   To Westerners, this makes him out to be a little Hitler,
defying his neighbors and even the world community in a way
that appears irrational, if not mad. An effort of imagination
and some knowledge of history are required to understand that
he is not in the least deranged but behaving in accordance
with ancient customs in the Middle East. Arabs do things
differently from us, and always have.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the customary Arab order, power belongs to whoever has
the will and capacity to capture and hold it. Such a man then
becomes honored, all the more if he has displayed brutal
skills that others could not match. This acquired honor
legitimizes and justifies his leadership. Even Arabs who have
reason to fear Saddam cannot help admiring him.
   Throughout the Arab Middle East there is no check of any
kind on absolute power: no government by consent, no
representative parliament or loyal opposition, no free
speech. Treaties, frontiers, sovereignty are Western concepts
easily brushed aside in the absence of institutions to
realize them. What might look like Arab nation-states are
therefore much closer to tribes held together by
military-type rulers according to custom and sanctioned by
honor. Everywhere the strong feel it only normal to oppress
the weak. That is why the Middle East is so violent and
backward.
   Imperial Britain and France once might have broken this
customary order but, perhaps to their credit, considered at
the time that the human cost would be too high. Instead, they
withdrew from the Middle East on terms that encouraged those
Arabs with the ambition for it to seize and exploit power as
they have been doing since time immemorial. The rise of Gamal
Abdel Nasser and the Suez crisis in 1956, the expropriation
of Western oil companies, the conduct of Moammar Gadhafi and
the sale of armaments on the most massive scale were so many
proofs in Arab eyes that the West no longer had the will or
the power to defend itself, and that its political and social
systems were not worthy of respect.
   Attacking Iran in 1980, Saddam launched a classic tribal
war, with its religious and ethnic undertones. Instead of
being obliged to suffer the consequences to the full, he was
rescued by the West and the Soviet Union, resupplied
militarily and backed diplomatically. What other conclusion
could he draw except that he had bent these countries to his
will? It seems certain to him that he had become the decisive
power-holder in the region, and that whoever did not show him
due honor and deference could be destroyed with impunity.
Undisputed leader of the Arabs, he sees himself a conquering
hero, the new Saladin, to be admired for all times. In that
spirit, Iraqis flashed the headlights of their cars and blew
their horns at the news of the capture of Kuwait.
   Also in that spirit, Saddam warned that Kuwait will become
a graveyard if the West intervenes. The former regime cannot
be restored because "the sun of honor" has now shone in
Kuwait. Iraqi radio reports pure tribal boasting: "We would
rather die than be humiliated, and we will pluck out the eyes
of those who attack the Arab nation." Saddam himself said
Wednesday that "death is preferable to humiliation."
   In the tribal order, peaceful negotiations may apply to
low-grade disputes, but genuine conflicts of interest have to
be resolved by force. No tribal leader dares risk the shame
that follows from making concessions. Saddam is now in this
predicament. He cannot admit that the invasion of Kuwait was
a gross miscalculation and still retain his honor. To
evacuate is to be humiliated. Should he fail, he knows well
that the Iraqis will not just cease to blow car horns but
will round on him and kill him.
   The logic of his situation suggests that instead he might
attempt to win the sort of honor that other Arabs would find
overwhelming, for instance by invading Saudi Arabia -- or
other Gulf states. A sure-fire way to unite the Arabs behind
him would be the approved tribal strike against Israel. In
the event of inflicting serious damage on Israel, he could
expect Arabs everywhere to grant him prizes like Kuwait. For
the time being, the only reasonable conclusion is that he
will do nothing that might bring shame upon himself. The rest
of the world has no option but to engage him on these terms.
   The purpose of American and other forces reaching the Gulf
is to secure a vital interest. A military expedition has set
off, the Security Council has voted for an embargo. Should
these measures fail, should Saddam be left in possession of
these spoils, the consequences will be suffered for many
years to come. For it will appear to Arabs that Saddam has
got the better of everyone, and really is the conqueror he
claims to be. Western and democratic values will be written
off even by those Arabs who aspire to them.
   Should fighting break out, the determination must be
inflexible to use whatever degree of force is necessary for
successful arbitration. Already Saddam's strategy is to
weaken Western resolution by means of various deceptions, for
instance holding Americans and Europeans who happen to be in
Iraq or Kuwait, implying that they are hostages. One of his
puppets in Kuwait stated that Western countries "should not
expect us to behave honorably" toward these people. Saddam of
course is sure that Iraqis in the West would not be similarly
hijacked.
   At this point in history there is no question of conquest
or imperialism. This is a clash of quite a different kind,
between past and present, between tribal custom and
government by consent. Before Arabs can take their place in
the modern world as they deserve, rulers of the stamp of
Saddam have to be exposed as the savage and outmoded tyrants
that they are.

   EL PASO, Texas -- In the old days, William F. Farah's
birthday was a happy time at Farah Inc. Employees would take
up a collection to buy a cake -- in the shape of a pair of
Farah pants, of course -- and hire a mariachi band.
Inevitably, Mr. Farah would request his favorite song, "El
Rey," which proclaims that, through persistence, the king
always prevails.
   In a tumultuous quarter-century as chief executive of
Farah, the king, indeed, always prevailed -- over several
possible successors, over his own sons and over lenders who
sought to keep him away from the company his parents created.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But now, Willie, as everyone calls Mr. Farah, may be
fighting his last battle.
   A year ago, the Farah board forced Mr. Farah out as chief
executive. In March, the board ousted him as chairman. The
company is wallowing in debt and red ink. Its sales, which
peaked at $366.1 million in 1986, fell to $239 million in
1989. Mr. Farah finds himself in a whirl of suits,
countersuits and a bitter proxy battle for control of the
family company he served for 53 years.
   His three sons, who grew up with a vision of carrying on
the family business, have been driven out after clashes with
the family patriarch. His daughter, the only family member
still on the board, voted to oust her father as chairman.
   And even though Mr. Farah's 16% stake in the company is
still worth about $4 million, this week he and his wife,
Betty, filed for bankruptcy protection. The petition, filed
in federal bankruptcy court in El Paso, contains few details
of the Farahs' finances, but Mr. Farah's lawyer said a
decline in the price of Farah stock had led to the filing.
Listed among the creditors are the Farahs' four children, to
whom they owe an estimated $2.3 million.
   Today, shareholders at a special meeting will vote on Mr.
Farah's demand to dump seven of the nine directors. He says
he would replace them with his own slate. This much is
certain: Willie Farah's dream of a family dynasty reigning
over a billion-dollar apparel company is dead.
   Mr. Farah recently celebrated his 71st birthday -- not at
his company, surrounded by loyal employees, a mariachi band
and loving offspring, but at a Mexican restaurant,
accompanied only by his wife. "It's really a tragedy," says
Kenneth Farah, one of the sons. "In the end, Willie has no
company and no love from his family. He sacrificed his
relationship with his kids for the love of his company.
That's a pretty tragic figure."
   Responds Willie: "Our kids have turned out to be decent
and great human beings. So it's hard to understand why they
are so vindictive with their parents."
   Farah Inc. was founded here in 1919 by Mansour and Hana
Farah, a Lebanese immigrant couple. It was a small but
thriving business when Mansour died in 1937 and his two sons
took over.
   Jimmy Farah, the financial whiz, neatly complemented
Willie, an engineer whose newly designed production lines
established Farah as an early leader in automation. That
partnership lasted until Jimmy's sudden death in 1964. To
this day, his desk and chair remain as they were.
   Jimmy, considered the more flexible and compassionate of
the brothers, was much beloved by employees. He often joined
workers for a beer and a game of horseshoes, and he listened
to their suggestions.
   Willie, on the other hand, was perceived as opinionated
and unbending. A super-patriot, he insisted on using only
U.S.-made sewing machines and home-grown needles and thread.
For a long time, he would hire only U.S. citizens -- not an
easy task in a town teeming with both legal and illegal
immigrants -- and he refused to build foreign plants, where
wages were lower. Once, he even insisted that a contractor
pull out every Japanese-made nail used in the building of his
house.
   Nevertheless, Willie Farah presided over a period of
unprecedented growth at the firm. He shifted its emphasis
from making private-label slacks for retailers to selling its
own, higher-priced Farah-brand casual slacks to specialty and
department stores. He took the company public in 1967. And by
1970, sales had skyrocketed to $136 million from just $19
million a decade earlier. The work force swelled to 8,000,
making Farah El Paso's largest non-government employer.
   Mr. Farah's children, who grew up cleaning floors and
manning the switchboard at the company, began taking
positions of responsibility. In 1970, oldest son Jimmy, fresh
out of Stanford University and the Wharton business school,
started in the manufacturing department. Kenneth had earlier
dropped out of the University of Texas at El Paso to work in
the customer-service department.
   Just about then, things began to go bad for the company.
In 1971, workers seeking to unionize launched a strike that
lasted two years and led to a crippling nationwide boycott of
Farah products before Mr. Farah relented.
   Willie plowed $10 million into a new textile mill to make
denim, but in an industry plagued by excess
denim-manufacturing capacity, the new plant turned into an
expensive albatross. Mr. Farah also resisted making
double-knit slacks when they were all the rage, then
overproduced them after the fad had peaked.
   Mr. Farah won't talk about such specific issues. His sons
say the missteps all stemmed from Mr. Farah's inflexibility,
and that he ignored them when they tried to warn him about
the problems.
   As a result, relations grew increasingly tense. When sons
passed father in the hallway, employees say, few words were
exchanged. Kenneth soon resigned, convinced he could never
work for his father. "Willie does not tolerate these words:
`I don't agree with you,' " he says.
   In 1976, Willie bypassed Jimmy and named William Leone, a
Farah director, as president. Mr. Farah grew unhappy with his
choice in a matter of weeks and forced him to resign,
complaining that Mr. Leone couldn't divine men's fashion
trends. (Mr. Leone couldn't be reached for comment.)
   Fed up with Mr. Farah's quirky reign, directors --
including son Jimmy -- voted to strip him of the title of
chief executive in 1977. But the act tormented Jimmy,
eventually driving him to resign from the board and leave the
company. "I didn't want to oppose him," Jimmy says, "but I
also couldn't support him."
   Willie Farah began to plot a comeback. But he was blocked
by a consortium of creditors who threatened to declare a $22
million loan in default and padlock the company if he
regained control. He grudgingly yielded. But two successive
replacements, including noted turnaround consultant Andrew
Galef, failed to revive the company. The new board, Mr. Farah
complained, consisted of intellectuals who "didn't know a
damn thing about the garment industry."
   In 1978, he regained control after a proxy contest and
initiated a purge. Armed security guards escorted Mr. Galef
and his aides to their cars, and dozens of employees branded
as disloyal were dismissed.
   Mr. Farah also sued the lenders who had sought to prevent
his return -- and won a $14 million judgment, one of the
first to punish lenders for interfering in their borrowers'
businesses. Willie Farah was back.
   But his empire was in disarray. When he and his latest
heir-apparent, Ray Williams, a tough former executive vice
president of V.F. Corp.'s jeans-making H.D. Lee division,
took command, the company needed $350,000 daily to operate
and had just $250,000 in the bank.
   The two men cut expenses drastically, introduced some hot
new product lines and even went shopping themselves,
acquiring trendy Generra Sportswear Co. for $35 million to
beef up apparel offerings.
   Mr. Williams convinced Mr. Farah that the company had to
move jobs to other countries to stay competitive. Plants soon
blossomed in Costa Rica and Mexico.
   But relations between the two men eventually soured. One
issue: Mr. Farah reneged, former executives say, on a promise
to Mr. Williams to keep the Farah children out of management.
In 1979, Jimmy returned as sales manager, and son Robert was
eventually named to head international operations. Kenneth
returned later as an accountant.
   A miffed Mr. Williams resigned in 1984.
   For Mr. Farah's sons, the second time around didn't prove
much better than the first. "Willie expected blind
obedience," Kenneth says. The senior Mr. Farah bypassed both
Kenneth and Jimmy and offered the presidency to youngest son
Robert. Robert declined, saying the job should be offered to
the oldest brother. Finally, Jimmy got the job. Neither he
nor his brothers will comment on the episode.
   The squabbling continued. The senior Mr. Farah pushed for
added plant capacity that he felt would increase efficiency.
Jimmy argued that the company already had high inventory
levels and too much production capacity. The father ended the
debate with a curt, "I know what I'm doing," Jimmy recalls.
   "People say I was my father's whipping boy," he says.
"They were right."
   The sorest point for the family was the patriarch's
refusal to discuss a plan of succession. The issue led to
much screaming behind closed doors, company officials say.
Family-business consultants were flown in for group therapy
sessions; family members urged Willie -- unsuccessfully -- to
attend seminars on coping with family businesses.
   Jimmy and Robert finally offered to sell their stock in
1986, which their father interpreted as an act of disloyalty,
says Jimmy. Kenneth, meantime, secretly began lining up
creditor support for a takeover bid. But word leaked to his
father, who summoned him to his office.
   In a tense meeting also attended by Jimmy and Robert,
Kenneth Farah recalls, Mr. Farah searched his son's briefcase
for company documents and asked what the offer was going to
be. He was told $21.50 a share -- the stock was trading at
about $18 -- which he brusquely dismissed as too low.
   Then he summoned security guards to escort the banished
scion to his car. "I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas with my
in-laws," Kenneth says. "Holidays haven't been the same
since."
   Soon thereafter, Robert and Jimmy were forced out as well.
Mr. Farah was firmly in command again, but sales were
declining and inventories growing to dangerous levels. Still,
he inexplicably pressed for more production capacity.
Eventually, he put the money-losing company on the auction
block, but the only bid was quickly withdrawn. To avoid a
bankruptcy-court filing, the company sold its profitable
Generra unit to a managementled group for $27 million.
   With troubles mounting, Mr. Farah agreed, in the summer of
1989, to step down as chief executive in exchange for a $1.2
million payment and $365,000 a year for three years of
consulting. But senior company officials and board members
say they warned the new CEO, Richard Allender, to expect
constant meddling from Mr. Farah, who remained chairman. "I
knew what I was getting into," Mr. Allender concedes.
   Indeed, within months, the two men were engaging in
spirited -- and highly public -- debates about everything
from company strategy to painting the walls (Mr. Farah
objected to Mr. Allender's plan to change the wall color from
red to gray). Mr. Allender wanted to improve quality by
abandoning automated production in favor of hand-stitched
garments, an idea that enraged Mr. Farah, the father of the
company's automated process.
   Frustrated, Mr. Farah wrote angry letters to board members
in March, insisting that they either oust the new management
or step down themselves. The move backfired badly. His fellow
directors booted him off the board and named private investor
Thomas G. Wyman chairman.
   The motion was supported by Mr. Farah's then-pregnant
daughter Haleen, who had privately told other board members
that she had "no confidence" in her father. She declines to
comment.
   Mr. Farah filed suit in El Paso county court, seeking to
have the company restrained from limiting his role. He
contended the Farah board was filled with "spiteful
conspirators" out to ruin him financially. The company
countersued, contending Mr. Farah's fight was just a scheme
to postpone payment on a $750,000 company loan. Both suits
are pending.
   Mr. Wyman, the new chairman, complains that Mr. Farah
"walks around the building telling employees and executives
that he will fire them if he regains control for supporting
top management. That doesn't do much for morale."
   Mr. Farah, who still has an office in the building because
of his consulting contract, won't comment on such specifics.
But he says he has done nothing wrong. He says the company is
breaking under the weight of an inexperienced board and a
management team that he derides as "dummies." He blames the
company's problems on poor quality, a bad delivery record and
misguided strategy.
   At the center of the storm, Mr. Allender talks bravely
about the new Farah, with its new lighting system, new
computers and new training program in Mexico and Costa Rica.
He boasts of new, higher-quality products for respected
retailers such as Macy's and Dillards that will forever shuck
the company's image as the king of polyester. By spring, he
predicts, Farah will be profitable.
   That would be a significant turnaround. For 1989, the
company had a net loss of $11.6 million. It is carrying about
$68 million in debt. And after a $1.4 million second-quarter
loss this year, its stock has skidded to less than $3 a share
from its 1990 peak of $8.
   A tense Mr. Farah complains that his office phone is
tapped and that Farah officials changed the locks on several
sections of the building to keep him from mingling with key
employees. He also claims the company is spying on him. Over
barbecued chicken and black coffee at a Dallas restaurant, he
warily eyes a customer reading a newspaper nearby. "He's been
listening to every word I'm saying," he says.
   Mr. Farah says he has "no relationship" with Jimmy or with
his daughter, who, he adds, hasn't let him and his wife visit
his daughter's new son. "Haleen has been mad at me since the
day I fired Jimmy," he says. "But if Jimmy knew what he was
doing, he'd still be running the company." He pauses, then
adds: "We worked like dogs all of our lives for ourselves and
for our kids. We gave them one million shares {250,000 shares
each}. Maybe we gave them too much. In retrospect, I would
have given them the shares, but no voting power."
   The sons, who once dreamed of inheriting the company, now
have scattered. Kenneth sells baby furniture and Robert sells
photographic equipment; Jimmy, who serves as a consultant to
apparel manufacturers, recently completed his first
venture-capital transaction. Distance hasn't eased the
tension. Last Christmas, when Jimmy showed up at a dinner
given by Kenneth and his wife, Lysa, his father abruptly rose
from the table and walked out of the house.
   While his family celebrated the season inside, Willie
Farah, the once and perhaps future garment king, stewed in
his car for three hours.
   Jimmy talks haltingly about his father. "If there's
something I really want to be quoted in this article as
saying, it's that I really love my pop, I miss my pop," he
says. Why can't he say that in person? "It's too difficult,"
he says. "Believe me, I've tried."

   Mideast Crisis
   May Cost U.S.
   Extra $3 Billion

   WASHINGTON -- The confrontation in the Middle East could
cost the Pentagon $3 billion or more in unexpected costs for
fuel, spare parts and hazardous pay for troops if it
continues for several months, according to military budget
experts.
   The $3 billion estimate doesn't factor in possible damage
to U.S. ships and planes or the cost of ammunition and
missiles if actual fighting occurs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The largest part of the anticipated extra costs, according
to Pentagon officials and congressional aides, involves
higher fuel prices the military must pay world-wide as a
result of increases in the price of crude oil. The jump in
crude-oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is likely to
mean nearly $2 billion in higher overall fuel costs for the
U.S. armed forces by early next year, according to some
internal Pentagon estimates.
   Unless world oil prices plummet -- which few people expect
-- those extra costs will strain Pentagon budget accounts
regardless of how long U.S. troops remain in Saudi Arabia.
   In addition, it's likely to cost hundreds of millions of
dollars to move large numbers of troops, planes and spare
parts to the Middle East, and then keep them there for an
extended period.
   The total price tag, of course, depends on the military
situation on the ground. But according to budget analysts,
the massive airlift and deployment of U.S. naval power in the
region entails huge extra fuel costs. Stepped-up air and sea
operations are bound to mean increased maintenance and
logistics costs.
   Neither the military nor congressional committees have
developed detailed cost estimates, and senior Pentagon
officials have declined to comment on the matter. But
officials note that the U.S. invasion of Panama earlier this
year -- a much simpler and smaller operation that lasted only
a few weeks -- cost the Defense Department nearly $400
million in extra operating and personnel costs.
   In the short term, each of the armed forces will try to
cope with the problem by cutting back on routine maintenance,
purchases and other nonessential operating expenses. But if
the military confrontation continues for several months, the
Pentagon either will have to ask Congress to approve a
supplemental appropriations measure or give it greater
authority to transfer funds among certain accounts.
   As part of that strategy, the White House announced
yesterday that President Bush plans to partly exempt spending
on military personnel from any automatic spending cuts that
might occur this fall.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Mr. Bush plans
to shield only as much Pentagon spending as needed to
maintain U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. He said Mr. Bush and
his budget advisers, who conferred Wednesday night, still
aren't sure what the deployment will cost.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, Mr. Bush
must decide by Wednesday whether to exempt some or all
Pentagon spending on uniformed personnel from the automatic
spending cuts that will be triggered in October -- unless
Congress finds a way to reduce the deficit by $74 billion or
alters the Gramm-Rudman statute.
   Although the administration is preparing to impose about
$84 billion in Gramm-Rudman spending cuts, many in Congress
doubt cuts of that size will be allowed to go into effect
because they would be so disruptive to the government and
economy.
   If Pentagon personnel spending is protected, other
military spending would be cut more deeply under the law.
Should personnel be exempted entirely, Pentagon spending
would be cut by 34.9%, the White House budget office
estimated. Non-defense spending covered by the law would be
cut by 31.9%.

   Muses About Pete Rose

   DETROIT -- "It's time to slam-dunk the judge in Cincinnati
for putting Pete Rose in jail," says the Detroit radio talk
show host. "It serves no purpose whatsoever."
   That's the word from a man who has been there -- former
Detroit Tigers pitching ace Denny McLain, who served 2 1/2
years in federal prison before his conviction on charges of
racketeering, extortion and drug-dealing was overturned in
1987. He had been sentenced to 23 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Rose, the former Cincinnati Reds player and manager,
entered the federal prison at Marion, Ill., this week to
serve five months for filing false income-tax returns. He was
also fined $50,000. As Mr. Rose begins his stint, he has
reason to take heart: If Denny McLain was able to make a
comeback, anybody probably can.
   In 1970, Mr. McLain was suspended from baseball three
times: first for investing in a bookmaking ring, then for
throwing water on sportswriters, and finally for carrying a
gun. Off the field, he lurched from one business disaster to
another, twice declaring insolvency.
   Life since prison has been kind to Mr. McLain, although at
46 years of age he is many pounds overweight and bears little
resemblance to the stylish athlete who in 1968 won 31 games
-- nobody since has come close -- and pitched the Tigers into
the World Series. But he has kept the crooked grin and
rough-spun sense of humor that amused Detroit baseball fans.
Even his love life has been aired on his show. He recently
told his listeners how "pure, unmitigated PMS" ruined an
anticipated romantic interlude with Mrs. McLain in a
heart-shaped Jacuzzi.
   "Of all the athletes I've known he is the most unusual,"
says Joe Falls, a Detroit News sports columnist, who has been
covering Mr. McLain since the early 1960s. "I like him," he
says, adding that he can't defend Mr. McLain's past behavior.
   Detroit likes him, too. His morning talk show at WXYT has
nearly doubled its ratings since Mr. McLain took over five
months ago. The show has 165,000 listeners, the station says.
Mr. McLain also appears on a local television sports show.
Outside Detroit, he gets paid for appearing at baseball-card
shows. He won't say how much he earns.
   As for Mr. Rose, Mr. McLain tells his radio audience,
"Money is the way to hurt Pete, not jail." He says the judge
should have fined Mr. Rose $500,000 instead of $50,000.
"While he's in jail," he says, "he'll line up a thousand card
shows."
   Mr. McLain -- himself a potential candidate for baseball's
Hall of Fame -- says Mr. Rose shouldn't be admitted to the
institution, at least if he did bet on baseball games, as the
late baseball commissioner A. Bartlett Giammatti alleged last
year. Mr. McLain says he himself limited his betting to other
sports.
   But even as a baseball player, Mr. McLain played by his
own rules. He once purposely served up a home-run pitch to
the aging Mickey Mantle. Between starts, he flew around the
country to speak, perform on the organ or hobnob with
celebrities. The Tigers' management tolerated his antics
because Mr. McLain kept winning. "He was a cocky s.o.b.,"
says Gates Brown, a Tiger teammate in those days. "Then
again, he had the reason to be."
   Mr. McLain's winning ways came to a screeching halt in
1970, the year he was suspended three times. When he did get
to play, his pitches had lost their zip. Mr. McLain's right
shoulder, which had been injected dozens of times with
cortisone shots, was worn out. Two years later, at the age of
28, he pitched his last major league game. By his own
account, Mr. McLain spent the next dozen years wheeling and
dealing.
   "It was like he was out there floundering about," says
Sharyn McLain, his wife of 27 years. "He did a lot of
different things, but nothing made him happy."
   The McLains spent most of their time in Florida, where Mr.
McLain eventually got into big trouble. By his own admission,
he was involved in gambling. A plane leased to him was used
to transport cocaine, although he denied knowing of any drug
shipment. Neither federal authorities nor a federal court
jury in Tampa believed his denials, and he was convicted.
   While Mr. McLain was behind bars, his family was forced to
sell the house, most of the furniture, and a car. His wife
and children took jobs. "One week we had spaghetti five
nights in a row, just getting less and less every night,"
Mrs. McLain recalls.
   After his release from prison in 1987, he pleaded guilty
to all the pending charges against him to avoid a retrial.
The judge in the case, however, said he had served enough
time in prison.
   Mr. McLain began making paid appearances at card shows and
doing public relations for a minor-league hockey team in Fort
Wayne, Ind. He played the keyboard at a Detroit area night
spot where Leon Spinks, the former heavyweight boxing
champion, tended bar. And, with Mike Nahrstedt of the
Sporting News, he wrote a book about his troubles entitled
"Strikeout: The Story of Denny McLain."
   Then he got a big break. WXYT, the Detroit radio station,
offered him a job in April 1989 after he appeared as a guest.
"When I first heard him on the air, I knew he had the gift of
gab," says Joan Cherry Isabella, the station's executive
producer.
   Mr. McLain worked afternoons for nearly a year. Then he
got his shot at the key morning rush-hour traffic slot from 6
a.m. to 9 a.m. weekdays.
   Mr. McLain lives in a rented house in an executive suburb
of Detroit. He drives his Chevrolet Blazer to the radio
station, showing up before 5 a.m. each day, with a 12-pack of
sodas under his arm, to begin leafing through newspapers. He
has always read newspapers voraciously and professes more
interest in city politics than in sports. "I never grabbed
the sports section first unless there was something negative
about me," he says.
   He takes a special interest in criminal justice and
regularly discusses local court decisions on the air. He
calls himself middle-of-the-road. He dislikes abortion, but
he is pro-choice. He is for gun control, the Equal Rights
Amendment and capital punishment. Sometimes he talks of his
own time in prison. Recently he had Arnold Levine, his former
defense attorney, as a guest.
   Ted Koppel he isn't. "He doesn't go for the throat," says
Ms. Isabella, "but a lot of people are willing to talk to him
because of that."
   In some ways, he is still the old Denny. When he played
baseball, he had a reputation for waving off signals from his
catcher and making the pitch he wanted. Now, he waves off
signals from his producer. "Denny makes the rules up as he
goes along," says the producer, Arthur Regner.
   Mr. McLain plays a game in which listeners answer
questions about newsmakers. Winners are supposed to get
symphony tickets. But on this occasion, Mr. McLain decides to
give out pizza coupons instead. The trouble is, the station
has run out of pizza coupons.
   "We occasionally have to run behind him with a little
mop," says Michael Packer, the station's vice president. But
the radio station is happy to do that as long as Mr. McLain
keeps pitching his audience-grabbing spiels.
   After the show, he attacks his usual breakfast (three
eggs, three sausage patties) at a nearby restaurant that he
calls the "House of Pain." He still walks with a ball
player's swagger, flinging open the door as he enters a room.
But his wife and friends say prison changed him -- for the
better. "Being there can humble a person," says Mr. Brown.
Before becoming a professional baseball player, Mr. Brown
spent two years in state prison in Ohio on charges of
breaking and entering.
   Prison will be an eye-opener for Mr. Rose, too, says Mr.
McLain. "When some guy comes up to him and says, `What's your
name?'" Mr. McLain muses, "That's what will shock him."

   U.S. Acts to Learn if Keating Has Millions
   For Restitution Months After S&amp;L Failed

   WASHINGTON -- A full 18 months after the costliest thrift
failure ever, federal savings-and-loan officials are trying
to learn whether the thrift's top executive, Charles Keating
Jr., has $40.9 million he can return to the failed S&amp;L.
   Under administrative proceedings begun yesterday, thrift
regulators are seeking an accounting of Mr. Keating's
finances as well as $40.9 million in restitution -- a
fraction of the $2.5 billion in losses stemming from the
failure of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association.
</LP>

   The regulators also are seeking to remove Mr. Keating as
chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's Phoenix,
Ariz., parent, along with five other officers. In addition,
the regulators also would require Mr. Keating to give them
two days' notice before transferring assets in excess of
$5,000.
   "We do not believe his statements to the press or to the
public that he is broke," said Timothy Ryan, the director of
the Office of Thrift Supervision. "There was too much money
that was available to him, and too short a time for it all to
disappear."
   The proceedings began on the first anniversary of the
savings-and-loan cleanup law and federal officials have been
putting the best face possible on the deteriorating mess in a
flurry of recent speeches and news briefings.
   "This action is literally bolting the barn door after the
horse left," says Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think tank. "The money is already long gone.
This will join the many other cases in which they {the
regulators} may get successful judgments, but not any money."
   Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif., was seized by the government
in April 1989, one day after parent American Continental
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   The amount of restitution is the largest ever sought by
the thrift office, Mr. Ryan said. He added that he didn't
believe that 18 months was a long spell before getting a
grasp of Mr. Keating's finances. "I think it's prompt
action," Mr. Ryan said, but he added: "I've only been here
four months." Previously, Mr. Ryan was an attorney at the
Labor Department.
   An American Continental spokesman, Brad Boland, who is Mr.
Keating's son-in-law, said that federal regulators are
explicitly familiar with Mr. Keating's finances through a
separate federal suit filed by the Resolution Trust Corp.
   "As usual, when they can't get the results they want in a
court of competent jurisdiction, they resort to
administrative fiat," he said, adding: "They know every
nickel he has." Mr. Boland said that Mr. Keating's extensive
legal bills are being paid through insurance companies.
   The administrative case is being pursued alongside a
tangle of several other suits between the government and Mr.
Keating, who has become a symbol of the high-flying thrift
executive investing in wild land schemes.
   American Continental is in the midst of bankruptcy court
proceedings in Phoenix. The company has sued the thrift
office in an effort to overturn its seizure of Lincoln.
American Continental bondholders have sued the company
alleging fraud. The Resolution Trust Corp. is in the midst of
a $1.1 billion civil racketeering lawsuit against Lincoln.
And a grand jury in Los Angeles also is investigating Lincoln
for possible criminal violations. Throughout all of these
proceedings Mr. Keating has consistently denied any
wrongdoing.
   The administrative case focuses on three transactions
involving Mr. Keating and several associates of American
Continental. Regulators contend that these transactions piled
up the $40.9 million of losses.

   U.S. Sees Strength
   In the Harvests
   Of Corn, Wheat

   WASHINGTON -- The government forecast robust corn and
wheat production but lagging soybean output, according to the
Agriculture Department's first full-scale crop estimates for
the year.
   The department forecast a 1990 corn harvest of 7.85
billion bushels, up 4% from last year's output and unchanged
from its July estimate. The department said that "excellent
growing conditions" last month offset late Corn Belt
plantings and dry weather in the Southwest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Soybean production for this year was estimated at 1.84
billion bushels, down 5% from 1989 and 1% below the July
estimate, with soybean plantings off to a late start and
plant development continuing "behind normal," the department
said.
   These were the first field-survey forecasts for 1990 corn
and soybean production; previous estimates were based on
incomplete information, according to the department.
   The crop estimates, released after the close of futures
trading yesterday, were below those projected by many futures
analysts in recent weeks. With tighter-than-expected supplies
in the offing, soybean futures prices are expected to rise to
10 cents a bushel from five cents in early trading today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, analysts said.
   Corn futures prices may jump two to four cents a bushel
today in reaction to the government crop estimates, analysts
said.
   The figures released for the country's wheat crop aren't
expected to have as much of a market impact, analysts said.
   The corn estimate reflects good growing conditions, which
overcame wet weather earlier this year. Corn yields are
expected to average 117.7 bushels per acre, up 1.5 bushels
from last year but still below the record high of 119.4
bushels an acre in 1987. The department estimated that 1990
production of corn and other feed grains would be the highest
since 1986.
   It also forecast a sharp rise in wheat output to 2.71
billion bushels, up 33% from the drought-affected 1989 wheat
crop and slightly above the July estimate. Average yield was
estimated at 38.7 bushels an acre, 5.9 bushels more than in
1989, with output of wheat and other food grains expected to
be the largest since 1982. Winter wheat, the bulk of the
wheat crop, is nearly all harvested.
   With wheat stockpiles climbing, the department last week
said it would order a 10% to 20% cutback in 1991 wheat
acreage under the government-subsidized program. Wheat
surpluses fell sharply in recent years because the government
subsidized exports; the stockpiles this year are projected to
rise to 846 million bushels by June 1, 1991, from 535 million
bushels on June 1, 1989.
   The National Association of Wheat Growers blamed the
rising stockpiles on a recent decline in exports and the
department's cutback in spending on export subsidies
programs.
   Grain growers are expected to get less help from exports
than previously thought, according to a separate Agriculture
Department report released yesterday. The department's
forecast of Soviet Union grain imports for the marketing year
that began July 1 was reduced by six million tons to 30
million tons, the lowest level in four years. The latest
estimate would be down from 38 million tons in the previous
year.
   The department's forecast of 1990 Soviet grain production
was boosted by 15 million tons to 230 million tons, with
"bumper yields" cited. Both total Soviet grain production and
the wheat harvest were estimated at the highest levels since
1978, and the coarse-grain harvest was forecast at only
slightly below the 1987 level and two million tons under the
record high 1976 total.
   "World and U.S. wheat trade prospects have weakened,
mainly because of improved crops and reduced imports likely
for the Soviet Union and China," the department said.

   Nearly 400 commercial real-estate professionals were asked
to forecast annual real-estate appreciation through 1994. No
sector was predicted to even keep pace with inflation. The
main culprits: overbuilding, identified by nearly 90% as one
of the factors having the greatest impact on investment
performance, and economic recession, cited by 75%. Survey
respondents also named Houston as the single local market
with the most investment potential. The most overvalued
market: New York City.

                      Boomers and Bust
                                                                                                       

   Demographics have clearly been on housing's side. No
longer. During the '70s and '80s, house-hungry baby boomers
pushed consruction -- and prices -- to astronomical levels.
The boomers are still hungry, and they're eager to shed their
old homes and buy new, bigger ones. There's only one problem:
The baby bust is coming up behind them, and there aren't
enough busters to buy the boomers' homes. That's going to put
a crimp on new-home construction. But the constructoin
industry isn't despairing entirely. If homeowners can't sell
and trade up, they do have an alternative: remodeling. The
National Association of Home Builders foreasts that by the
end of the decade, additions and alterations to existing
homes will rise to about one-third ofconstruction activity
from about one-fourth currently. "The trade-up is going to
happen," says David Seiders, chief economist of the home
builders' group. "It's just going to take a different form."
