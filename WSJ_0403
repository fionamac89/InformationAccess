   HOUSTON -- Tenneco Inc. said its Midwestern Gas
Transmission pipeline unit has started offering open-access
service under a "blanket" certificate from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. The unit's open access had been
limited to local distribution companies and intrastate
pipelines; the new certificate extends open access to end
users and other interstate pipelines.

   Two Hong Kong Concerns Are in Talks
   To Buy Metropolitan Life Hotel Unit

   HONG KONG -- Two concerns controlled by shipping magnate
Sir Y.K. Pao said they are seeking to acquire a hotel unit
from Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. of New York, in a move
that would extend an overseas expansion binge by Hong Kong
entrepreneurs.
   Spokesmen for Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. and World
International (Holdings) Ltd., two local companies controlled
by the family of Sir Y.K., said negotiations with the U.S.
life insurer are at an advanced stage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The focus of the talks is MetHotels Inc., a Metropolitan
Life unit that runs 35 U.S. hotels under the Doubletree chain
and a further 32 under the Compri chain. Through management
contracts and franchises, MetHotels operates the hotels but
doesn't own equity interest in the real estate.
   John T. Hung, a director of Wharf, said the transaction
could be concluded by "the end of May or early June." He
declined to disclose the sum involved.
   Stephen Ng, managing director of Wharf, said that, if
completed, the MetHotels purchase would about "double the
size of Omni," a North American hotel chain that Wharf and
World acquired in 1988 for HK$1.05 billion (US$134.5 million
at current exchange rates).
   If concluded, the purchase would add to the growing list
of acquisitions -- especially of North American hotel
operations -- by Hong Kong concerns. Among the biggest so far
is the New World group's US$355 million purchase last year of
Ramada Inc. of the U.S.
   Given local entrepreneurs' relative unfamiliarity with the
U.S. hotel industry, some of the acquisitions are widely
regarded as a leap into the unknown. But with this British
colony beset by slow economic growth and uncertainty over its
1997 return to Chinese sovereignty, the trend seems likely to
continue.
   "It's quite understandable why local hoteliers aren't
buying into more hotel operations in Hong Kong," said Ravi
Narain, an analyst with Peregrine Brokerage Ltd. "Whether the
U.S. offers the best alternative is another question."
   World, the principal public company controlled by Sir
Y.K., is about 62.5%-held by members of his family. Wharf, in
turn, is 40%-held by World. The two companies own interests
in Hong Kong real estate, retail businesses and
transportation. Until recently, their hotel operations
consisted only of three outlets in Hong Kong and one in
Singapore. The acquisition of the Omni chain in 1988 helped
the two companies gain their first major presence in North
America.
   Omni's North American operations currently consist of 39
hotels with about 16,000 rooms, most of them along the U.S.
East Coast. The chain mainly operates so-called businessmen's
hotels, which offer no-frills accommodation to business
travelers. Except for six or seven of the hotels in which
Omni has equity interests, the operation is limited mostly to
management and franchising.
   The MetHotels chain, with about 17,000 rooms, serves a
similar clientele but concentrates more on the West and
Southwest regions of the U.S. Mr. Hung said that these
operations, if merged with Omni, would provide what he termed
a perfect fit. "If you're a businessman traveling in the
U.S., you would be able to book with Omni all the way from
the West to the East Coast," he said.
   He added that the MetHotels negotiations have been spurred
by "organic growth" of the Omni operation and not by
political uncertainty in Hong Kong.
   To pave the way for the pending acquisition, Wharf and
World also announced a streamlining of their hotel management
business.
   The two companies currently own a half interest each in
Carlops Co., a Hong Kong subsidiary that holds the management
rights to the North American hotels. Management rights to the
four Asian hotels, on the other hand, are held by World only.
   Under the move, World would sell the Asian management
rights to Carlops for HK$280 million, which becomes the sole
hotel-management vehicle for the group.

   In Slow Market,
   Home Sellers
   Toss In Freebies

   Consumers who buy houses today are being offered a lot
more than four walls and a roof.
   Burdened by a slower market, builders and home sellers
across the country have unleashed an array of consumer lures
that are among the most extensive and costly that the housing
industry has seen in nearly a decade. Not since 1982, when
interest rates approached 20% and triggered widespread
giveaways, have buyers been courted with such a range of
freebies, some of which are more successful than others.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some developers are arranging for interest rates as low as
7%. Many builders will include any number of changes in the
floor plan for free. A California developer offers buyers
free washers and dryers and a chance to win a resort
vacation. An Illinois builder, Bigelow Group in Palatine,
will help first-time buyers by contributing up to $250 a
month to a special down payment fund.
   "Builders are using a variety of techniques to hold up
home sales in an environment of slack employment growth,
relatively high interest rates and buyer concerns about the
future of home prices," says David F. Seiders, chief
economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
   Sales of new houses generally have been sliding since last
summer, with the exception of a few monthly upticks, such as
in January, when new-home sales increased 3.1% from December,
to 607,000. Sales of existing houses also have declined. In
January, they fell 2.5% to 3.48 million units on an
annualized rate from 3.56 million units in December 1989.
   In response, the builders association says a full 50% of
builders recently surveyed are throwing in equipment or
details that used to be optional extras. About 35% pay all
points and 34% pay all closing costs, a package that can save
consumers anywhere from $4,000 to $7,000. Seventeen percent
maintain trade-in programs for existing homes and buy down
interest rates for a specified period of time.
   Private homeowners and relocation firms also have jumped
into the giveaways. Like developers, more homeowners are
offering to pick up financing fees such as points for buyers.
More offbeat is a man in Marin County, Calif., who tried to
lure buyers for his $510,000 house by including the choice of
his BMW or his Porsche Targa. PHH Homequity, a Wilton, Conn.,
relocation firm, has used free cars and trucks, free maid and
lawn service and expense-paid wedding receptions to whittle
down the time it takes to sell a house.
   As expensive as the marketing gimmicks have been, they
"have only been partly successful," Mr. Seiders says. The
biggest drag on sales has been a shrinking pool of buyers,
interest rate volatility and affordability problems.
Marketing gimmickry does little to overcome those
hard-to-cure ills, most economists say. "I don't think
{consumers} would buy just because a builder throws in a
Jacuzzi," says Brian Bragg, editor of U.S. Housing Markets, a
publication in Detroit.
   Despite PHH's efforts, for instance, it still takes an
average 151 days to sell a house, just a 10-day improvement
from the 161 days it took at year end 1987. And even with the
free car the Marin County homeowner had no luck selling. Last
week, he reduced his house to $499,000 and pulled the car
offer, according to the broker representing him.
   Others say every little bit helps. Sales would have shown
steeper declines if it weren't for the come-ons, some
analysts contend. Builders add that any sale -- even with
concessions -- is better than paying hefty carrying costs on
unsold houses. They also say they would rather offer
concessions than cut prices because financing for future
developments is based in part on prices they received for
previous sales.
   That's the attitude of W. Art Wells, a Montclair, N.J.,
builder who has pulled out the stops to sell houses in the
slow-moving New Jersey market. In past months, he has offered
a dizzying range of concessions and even bought the house of
a seller who wanted to buy one of his homes. He says he
figured it would be easier to sell the cheaper house than to
sell his more expensive brand new house.
   The lures were so sweet that Andrew and Robin De Vito
bought one of Mr. Wells's homes -- and they weren't really
looking to buy. Mr. Wells pieced together various features
from three different floor plans, incorporating chimney,
French doors and winding stairways that Mrs. De Vito liked.
He also arranged a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7% with no
points for the five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath house, for
which the De Vitos are paying between $500,000 and $600,000.
What's more, he arranged for the buyer of the De Vito's
house, which wasn't selling despite repeated price
reductions, to also receive a 7% mortgage rate.
   "When someone is giving something away free, I ask,
`where's the hook?'" Mr. De Vito says. "There ain't no hook.
He just needs to keep going."
   "We're trying our absolute hardest to market our property
as well as we can," said Mr. Wells, who says he still ekes
out a profit despite the concessions.
   Even in the once-torrid California market, concessions
have surfaced. In Colton, Calif., John C. Heers Inc. has
offered free washers and dryers for about a month. The bonus
appliances, as well as drawings to win expense-paid weekend
trips to Palm Springs, have helped boost consumer traffic
through the Southern California development to about 100
people a week, up from seven people before the promotions,
the company says. Sales, meanwhile, have increased to an
average five sales a month, up from two sales a month.
   "For the past three to four years, we haven't had to do
anything," says Deborah Millhouse, a sales marketing
assistant. But because the California market has slowed, "you
have to be a little more creative."
   Even so, it wasn't the extras that sold Creighten and
Agnes Willcutt, retirees who recently bought a $109,000,
two-bedroom, two-bath home in one of the company's seniors
developments. They simply liked the floor plan.

   Nicaragua's Voters Smart, Not Scared

   Alexander Cockburn's March 1 Viewpoint, "U.S.-Backed
Terrorism Won in Nicaragua, Not Democracy," pushes the "Blame
America First" syndrome to a new depth. Stating that Violeta
Chamorro's landslide victory is a result of the campesinos'
fear of the U.S. is not only absurd, it defies logic as well
as fact. In the past 10 years 400,000 Nicaraguans have voted
with their feet by leaving Daniel Ortega's workers' paradise.
Since it is highly doubtful that those emigres would have
voted en masse for the Sandinistas, Mrs. Chamorro's victory
is even more amazing. Mr. Cockburn also seems to have
forgotten that the Sandinistas outspent UNO by 3 to 1.
   I am certain Mr. Cockburn was initially stunned (along
with the party cadre, Sandinistas and the liberal
establishment of this country) at the size of the Chamorro
victory in light of pre-election polls. The Sandinistas
maintained a widespread informant network that operated on a
neighborhood level. With that in mind, why would the
electorate tell a Sandinista-sponsored pollster its true
feelings? Obviously fearful of honesty (with potential
negative repercussions), the people took the only sensible
course in answering a presidential-preference question. They
lied.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Cockburn too easily dismisses the wisdom of the
majority of Nicaraguan voters. They have joined Eastern
Europe and Lithuania in their open expression of contempt for
oppression, mindless propaganda and economic destruction of
their land by Marxist regimes.

   ---
   Mr. Cockburn tries to ridicule the already historic speech
of Czech President Vaclav Havel to Congress "as a way of
coaxing money from Congress for his country" -- completely
disregarding the fact that Czechoslovakia is the only country
recently liberated from communism that asked for no money at
all from the U.S. In an attempt to debase Mr. Havel further,
he chooses "my side suffered more than yours" tactics by
counting the people killed in El Salvador, Guatemala and
Nicaragua. On his morbid abacus he proved that "the Eastern
Europe under Soviet domination was benign indeed." Probably
he realized the need for more sophisticated computers to
handle the murdered millions by Stalin in U.S.S.R. alone.
   In contrast, Mr. Havel states that wherever an innocent
person is killed it is a tragedy for the whole of mankind. In
his words: ". . . the salvation of this human world lies
nowhere else than in the human heart, in the human power to
reflect, in human meekness and in human responsibility."
   I would sincerely recommend to Mr. Cockburn that he study
the writings of this Czechoslovakian president, philosopher
and playwright. They were written during the dark ages of
Eastern Europe, sometimes while the author was in jail, but
they never contained anger or vengeance against the
oppressors as human beings. What Mr. Havel was fighting
against was the dehumanizing philosophy of our time; the
results of the Czechoslovakian "velvet revolution" is a proof
that this way of fighting is successful.
   Karel Kriz
   Mt. Prospect, Ill.
   ---
   In his cynical critique of Mr. Havel's address to
Congress, Mr. Cockburn piously mentions "the terrible death
toll in Hungary in 1956," but the only East European figure
he gives to contrast with the large figures for Central
America is 92 dead from the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
in 1968. Estimates of "the terrible death toll in Hungary in
1956" range from 6,500 up to 32,000; about 190,000 Hungarians
fled their country. The Hungarian revolt lasted less than a
month; those Soviets, they don't fool around.

   Only Alexander Cockburn could be so outrageous as to
contend that the stunning defeat of his beloved Sandinistas
in Nicaragua, in an election so closely monitored it was
impossible to fix, was a capitulation to U.S.-sponsored
terrorism rather than a thrilling example of democracy
working precisely as intended.

   Mr. Boesky began his term in a minimum security prison in
Lompoc, Calif., in March 1987. He was released to the
Brooklyn halfway house last December, but because the
facility is overcrowded, he has been permitted to live at
home and has had to check in regularly. With time off for
good behavior, he has served little more than two years of
his sentence.
   Mr. Boesky is expected to make his courtroom debut as a
government witness as soon as next month, when the government
will try its case against John A. Mulheren Jr., an
arbitrager. Mr. Mulheren was charged with taking stock
positions for Mr. Boesky to conceal the true ownership of the
securities, a tactic known as stock "parking." A lawyer for
Mr. Boesky said the former stock speculator didn't know what
he would next do for a living. But the attorney said Mr.
Boesky isn't likely to return to the financial industry.

   WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Thomas Foley called on
President Bush to take the initiative in this year's effort
to reduce the budget deficit, and warned that difficulties
lie ahead if Mr. Bush doesn't.
   At a breakfast meeting with reporters, the Washington
state Democrat said the president must speak out forthrightly
if there is any hope for a tax increase of the kind that
Democrats believe is necessary for a meaningful budget
package.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But so far the president has only sidled up to, and has
failed to embrace, the tax-boosting deficit-reduction plan of
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and
Means Committee. A stronger statement of support by the
president is needed if a major deficit-reduction plan can
move ahead, Mr. Foley said.
   "The first action has to be taken by the president," the
speaker said. "First with the president, then with us."
   The House Budget Committee isn't likely to meet its
deadline of April 15 to devise a budget resolution, Mr. Foley
said. Reaching an agreement "is going to be difficult" if the
president continues to stand on the sidelines, he added.

   U.S. Firms Push Bush Administration
   To End Ban on Trade With Vietnam

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is being pressed to
end Washington's 15-year-old ban on trade and diplomatic
links with Vietnam. The pressure comes from U.S. firms that
want to do business there and from members of Congress who
think it's time to let old wounds heal.
   But prospects for a quick shift in administration policy
appear slim. Administration officials acknowledge a spate of
inquiries from U.S. companies that want to reopen Vietnam
trade, but the issue remains low on the president's agenda.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The administration is adamant that ties stay severed until
Hanoi agrees to on-site verification that Vietnamese soldiers
have left Cambodia, and that Vietnam contribute to a
settlement of Cambodia's continuing civil war. Vietnam agreed
to pull its troops out of Cambodia last year after a
decade-long occupation that failed to resolve the fighting
there. The U.S. would like Vietnam to "encourage" the
Vietnam-backed Cambodian premier, Hun Sen, to allow the
United Nations to verify the withdrawal and supervise
transition to an elected Cambodian government.
   "We think Vietnam can contribute to a settlement {in
Cambodia}," says David Lambertson, deputy secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. "If Vietnam does, the
political obstacle to normalization will have been removed."
   Many in Congress don't want to wait. "It's time to get
moving," says Sen. Frank Murkowski, ranking Republican on the
East Asia and Pacific affairs subcommittee, who says the
administration is out of step with changes in Vietnam.
   Similar sentiments for quicker consideration of
normalization were expressed last year in more than 100
government contacts made by businesses, reflecting a desire
on the part of companies such as General Electric Co. and
Boeing Co. to capitalize on what they see as Vietnam's
expanding opportunities. "It's purely exploratory at this
point," says Boeing spokesman James Boynton, "but we think
we'd like to talk to them about selling some airplanes."
   Even before Eastern Europe's communist countries made
history last year, Vietnam had begun dismantling its
centrally planned economy. By last March, price controls were
eased, business subsidies reduced and the currency devalued.
   "They have virtually eliminated central planning," says a
World Bank analyst. "They've gone further than any other
socialist country on price reform -- and did it before
Eastern Europe." Inflation has dropped from about 300% a year
to a more manageable 20% now. International investment is
being promoted.
   "Everyone in the world is trading there but the
Americans," says Doland Stader, the State Department's
Vietnam country officer. "The Japanese are there, the Koreans
are there, the Thais are there. But it's illegal for U.S.
firms."
   The Atlanta-based Cable News Network, a unit of Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., was allowed Jan. 4 to provide
ground receivers that will enable Vietnam to pick up CNN's
satellite signals. But there are no other known exceptions to
the embargo that has blocked trade since the fall of the
U.S.-supported South Vietnamese government in 1975.
   Last fall GE was forced to abandon a deal to provide
engines to a French consortium that intended to ship
airplanes to Vietnam, administration sources say. GE declined
to comment.
   Other U.S. concerns have expressed interest in exploring
oil, construction, tourism and sales opportunities, only to
watch competitors move in. Eastman Kodak Co., which views
Vietnam as a potential retail market, complained in January
to the State Department that Japanese competitors weren't
honoring their own country's sanctions against Vietnam.
   "The reason we did that was our concern, not so much with
U.S. sanctions, but with Japanese companies," says Kodak
spokesman Paul Allen. "The issue not only affects Kodak, but
any U.S. business doing business in Asia."
   The National Association of Manufacturers, representing
13,000 companies that account for 80% of U.S. industrial
output, argues against trade restrictions. While the
organization isn't specifically involved in the Vietnam
issue, trade specialist R.K. Morris sees no reason U.S.
companies shouldn't be allowed to compete.
   "We know this country has been running a trade deficit for
the last decade," Mr. Morris says. "We acknowlege some need
for sanctions, but U.S. export-control policies have to keep
up with reality."
   Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell, a Rhode
Island Democrat, favors faster action. As a first step to
lifting sanctions, he would exchange diplomatic missions.
"Then we would have discussions and play it by ear and see
what happens," he says.
   Sen. Pell's position reflects sentiment on Capitol Hill to
expand debate on Vietnam, especially in light of the failure
of communism in Eastern Europe. Arizona's Republican Sen.
John McCain, a former U.S. Navy pilot who spent five years in
a North Vietnam prison, is among those backing eased
tensions.
   "As with all countries you've had war with, there comes a
time when you have to re-evaluate your policy," he says.
   That re-evaluation could be a long one. Says another
senior State Department analyst: "Notwithstanding {Vietnam's}
economic changes, you clearly don't change a problem in a
matter of months that's been developing over years."

   On Charge of Unfair Securities Pricing

   NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
expelled Westmont Securities Corp. of Los Angeles and barred
a principal of the firm from association with any NASD member
for what the regulator called unfair pricing of securities.
   The disciplinary action was one of many announced by the
NASD, the self-regulatory agency for the over-the-counter
markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The firm and the principal, Azar Aslam Kahn of Northridge,
Calif., also were fined a total of $665,025. The NASD said
Westmont sold securities "at prices that were unfair in
relation to the prevailing market." Markups ranged from 5.44%
to 200%, the NASD said.
   The firm also failed to maintain minimum net capital and
committed other securities-rule violations, the NASD charged.
   North Coast Securities was expelled, and Michael J.
Olnick, a principal, was barred. The NASD alleged that the
firm and Mr. Olnick, both of Woodhaven, N.Y., didn't prepare
a monthly balance sheet and net-capital computations for
several months and failed to respond to agency requests for
information.
   South Richmond Securities Inc. of New York and two
principals agreed to a total $150,000 fine to settle NASD
excessive-markup charges against them without admitting or
denying wrongdoing.
   The firm also was suspended from effecting principal
transactions for retail customers for five days. The
principals, Barbara Hosman of Deer Park, N.Y., and Herman R.
Garcia Jr. of Staten Island, each was suspended for 30 days
and required to requalify as principals by exam.
   The firm and principals consented to findings that they,
among other things, sold securities of an affiliate to
customers at markups ranging from 92% to 140% over the
prevailing market price.
   Tejas Securities Inc. was suspended for 30 days and fined
$10,000. The NASD charged that the Houston firm failed to
employ a financial and operations principal, failed to carry
a blanket fidelity bond, and violated other securities rules.
   Brook Investments Inc. of Chicago and Peter W.
Schellenbach, a Glencoe, Ill., principal, were fined a total
of $50,000. Mr. Schellenbach was suspended for 60 days,
barred as a principal, supervisor or manager, and prohibited
from maintaining a proprietary interest in any NASD member
that isn't publicly traded.
   The NASD charged among other things that Mr. Schellenbach
tried to "give the illusion" that the firm was complying with
net-capital requirements by buying and reselling accounts
receivable of Brook at the end of a month.
   Mr. Schellenbach has appealed the decision to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Black &amp; Co. of Portland, Ore., was fined $5,000; Arthur
Joseph Lewis, a Beaverton representative, was fined $25,000
and suspended for a year; and the firm and two Portland
principals, Eugene Philip Goodrich and Dennis Burton Reiter,
were fined a total $15,000.
   The sanctions were based on findings that Mr. Lewis
recommended that a customer buy and sell securities, although
the broker didn't have reasonable grounds to believe that the
recommendations were suitable. The NASD charged that the
firm, through Messrs. Reiter and Goodrich, failed to properly
supervise Mr. Lewis, among other things.
   Mr. Lewis has appealed the decision to the SEC.
   The following individuals were barred by the NASD. Fines
are indicated:
   John Dumas Karras, San Diego, $257,000; Trace Edward
Paradise, Arlington, Texas, $100,000; Donato Anthony
Minicozzi, Summit, N.J., $60,000; Bruce H. Gilbertson,
Whitehall, Pa., $50,000; George J. Wasson of Minneapolis,
$25,000 and, separately, an additional $12,500; Ronnie Anne
Martin, Pomona, N.Y., $30,000; Scott F. Casaccio of
Plainview, N.Y., $25,000, and Glen Vincent Benussi, Astoria,
N.Y., $17,000.
   Also, Mitchel J. Anderson of Minneapolis; Joseph W. Casey
Jr. of Hoover, Ala.; Arrel W. Dietrich of Novi, Mich.; John
Joseph Harrington of Westlake Village, Calif.; William
Preston King II of New York; Lilli A. Meaux of Memphis; Sam
Meo of Brentwood, N.Y.; Norman G. Parker of Birmingham, Ala.;
and Robert Walter Rada of Colorado Springs, Colo., $15,000
each.
   And Ronald D. Bonds, Byhalia, Miss., $10,000; Brian G.
Allen of Silver Spring, Md.; Scott Franzen of Chanhassen,
Minn.; Thomas J. Morrell of Franklinville, N.J.; and Donald
L. Stevenson of Evergreen Park, Ill., $5,000 each; and
Lawrence Kobert of Flanders, N.J., $1,000.
   Mr. Allen has appealed the decision to the SEC.
   Robert Herman Schumann of Sabetha, Kans., was barred and
fined $5,000, but he didn't admit or deny any wrongdoing.
   Other disciplinary suspensions and fines include: Brenden
James King of Scotch Plains, N.J., six months and $15,000;
David L. Newell of Mobile, Ala., six months and $10,000; and
Charles Gary Varesano of Clifton, N.J., 15 business days and
$6,000.
   The following neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing:
Joseph Anthony Friscia of New York, two years as a principal
and $10,000; Frank John Ruggieri Jr. of Little Neck, N.Y.,
two years as a financial and operations principal and
$10,000; Reece D. Rogers, Memphis, Tenn., two years and
$2,000; and Robert Douglas Therell of Matthews, N.C.,
$20,000.
   Except as noted below, the firms and individuals in-
volved in NASD disciplinary actions couldn't be reached for
comment:
   Speaking for South Richmond Securities, Martin H. Kaplan
of the Manhattan law firm Gusrae, Kaplan &amp; Bruno said, "The
intended charges that were never brought by the NASD were
settled to avoid the cost of extended litigation with the
NASD. South Richmond never admitted that there were markups
in any way resembling" those the NASD alleged. "Absolute
numbers lie absolutely, and reasonable men can differ as to
their construction."
   At Black &amp; Co., Mr. Reiter declined to comment.
   Mr. Therrell said that "no customer lost money or was
harmed in any way, nor even complained to the NASD or anyone
else. The charges stem from a paper-work mixup that occurred
years ago, when I was changing my registration from a
national firm to a local one. . . . I believe I had a solid
defense to the NASD's rather technical allegations.
Nonetheless . . . I decided to settle the case in order to
avoid the time and expense" of litigation.

   Conservatives Uneasily Mute Critisim of Bush
   For His Low-Key Stance on Lithuania's Struggles
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- The right is rumbling over President Bush's
low-key approach to Lithuania's quest for independence -- but
it isn't prepared yet to openly challenge him.
   Conservatives complain that Mr. Bush, who has mostly urged
Lithuanian leaders and the Kremlin to negotiate a solution to
their standoff, should show more backbone in supporting
Lithuania's attempt to break away from the Soviet Union. Many
conservatives want Mr. Bush to acknowledge the republic's
independence, recognize its self-proclaimed government and
warn the Kremlin more bluntly against intervening.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet so far conservatives don't seem prepared to go beyond
grumbling, and there isn't any organized drive to force a
change in administration tactics. The most prominent
conservative who has complained directly to Mr. Bush about
his approach, House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
promptly backed off his criticism. "We had a very spirited
exchange, and he won," Rep. Gingrich said after a closed
White House meeting last week.
   Among conservatives generally, "right now there's concern,
but I think they're willing to give Bush time to see how he
plays it out," says Donald Devine, a conservative activist.
"It's very important to Bush to handle this right."
   Of course, Mr. Devine and others warn that conservatives'
restiveness would turn quickly into an avalanche of
criticism, if Mr. Bush's tactics backfire and the Soviets
crack down violently in Lithuania. In that event,
conservative restiveness over Lithuania could combine with
lingering unhappiness over Mr. Bush's overtures to China
after Beijing's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and
produce an outbreak of criticism the White House couldn't
ignore.
   But for now, the relatively muted conservative reaction
over Lithuania is surprising, considering that the Soviets'
1940 seizure of Lithuania and other Baltic republics has long
been a prominent emotional complaint among American
conservatives.
   A combination of factors seems to have converged to cause
conservatives to hesitate. For starters, some suspect Mr.
Bush might be correct in maintaining that a confrontation
with the Kremlin, while emotionally satisfying, could
actually hurt the Lithuanian cause by prompting a Soviet
backlash. That leaves conservatives agonizing over whether to
follow their hearts, which tell them the U.S. should
challenge the Kremlin, or their heads, which suggest that
caution may be wiser.
   "Sometimes you need to look beyond the immediate emotional
demand," says Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican and
leading House conservative on foreign policy issues. "I
honestly am in a quandary. I don't know what to do."
   Beyond that, President Bush's understated approach with
the Kremlin seems to have produced results, in the form of
new non-Communist governments throughout Eastern Europe over
the last year. That means that President Bush, though no
darling of conservatives, has some credibility now on
East-West issues that leaves him less vulnerable to attack
from the right.
   "I'm convinced from my meeting with President Bush that,
even if he isn't doing exactly what I'd do, he's interested
in the same objective, so I'm not going to attack him," says
Rep. Christopher Cox (R., Calif.), a longtime champion of the
Baltic republics who last week reported to Mr. Bush on a
recent trip he made to Lithuania.
   More broadly, the Lithuanian showdown comes at a time when
conservative groups have begun shifting away from their
traditional focus on anti-Communist foreign policy and
devoting more attention to domestic issues. Conservative
activists aren't as poised to jump on a foreign-policy issue
as they were in the days before the Soviet threat began
receding.
   Of course, the White House is beginning to feel some heat
from conservatives over its Lithuanian tactics. Sen. Jesse
Helms (R., N.C.) angered White House aides by pushing the
Senate to adopt a tough resolution calling on Mr. Bush to
recognize Lithuania's self-proclaimed government and to send
an ambassador to the "Republic of Lithuania." That resolution
was defeated by the Senate, which then passed a watered-down
version calling on Mr. Bush merely to "consider the call" of
Lithuania for recognition.
   "The recognition of Lithuania is the right thing to do, no
matter what the consequences," Mr. Helms declares.
   A resolution similar to Sen. Helms's has been introduced
in the House. But there, too, a milder version calling on the
administration to consider recognizing Lithuania seems likely
to pass this week. "There is a general feeling that the
president needs to be considerably more outspoken," says Rep.
Mickey Edwards, an Oklahoma Republican who is a sponsor of
the tougher House resolution.
   Similarly, Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative
Caucus, maintains that grass-roots conservative unhappiness
with the administration's low-key posture is more widespread
than it seems. He says that at a recent meeting of his
organization in New Jersey, there were 300 conservatives in
attendance and "there wasn't a person in the room who wasn't
upset that there hasn't been recognition" of Lithuania.
"There is a considerable amount of disaffection."
   Mr. Phillips argues that the disaffection hasn't been felt
more because there isn't a clear conservative leader to take
the lead -- particularly since Rep. Gingrich backed down
after his exchange with the president. The criticism
therefore "is diffused," Mr. Phillips says. "I think Bush has
been very lucky politically."
   White House aides contend that most conservatives
basically agree with Mr. Bush that America's top priority is
to ensure that Mr. Gorbachev and other Kremlin leaders
continue their overall reforms of the communist system -- and
to prevent the Kremlin from using flashpoints such as
Lithuania to halt that reform process. "George Bush is
trusted at this critical time by a lot of conservative
leaders because he's seen as having kept the main thing the
main thing: the focus on the Soviet Union," says Douglas
Wead, a presidential assistant who is a liaison to
conservative groups.
   Still, conservative activists are poised to attack if
things turn nasty in Lithuania despite Mr. Bush's pleas for
restraint. If that happens, their unhappiness over the
administration's tactics in Lithuania and China will release
"a growing sense of outrage that will have political
repercussions," says Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan
administration Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for
Security Policy.

   Early last November, just as the company was wrapping up
its tortuous negotiations to acquire the state-owned
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. aerospace and defense

regimes in Eastern Europe were swept away by pro-democracy
movements, and the threat of war in Central Europe
evaporated. By year's end, West Germans were clamoring for a
"peace dividend" of their own.
   The Bonn government, after playing midwife to the
Daimler-MBB merger, is now considering deep cuts in its
defense budget to help finance the staggering costs of
rebuilding East Germany. Entire arms projects -- including
the controversial 60 billion mark ($35 billion) Eurofighter
project, in which MBB plays a key role -- are now on thin
ice.
   The rush of events caught Daimler off balance. A maker of
everything from missiles to toasters, the company was
counting on lucrative defense contracts to bankroll its
ambitious growth strategy. The expansion, launched in the
mid-1980s, was designed to create a global technology
conglomerate and to reduce Daimler's dependence on the
automotive business.
   As Daimler hurriedly refocuses its strategy away from
defense, many of the basic objectives remain the same. In one
new area of emphasis, the group is seeking powerful alliances
in commercial aerospace and technology with established
players in the U.S. and Japan. Meanwhile, its prestigious
Mercedes cars and trucks will play a larger role than ever in
maintaining sales and profits.
   "Daimler was thrown a curve ball by developments in
Eastern Europe and their impact on MBB's main sales source,
defense," says Stephen Reitman, an analyst for UBS-Phillips &amp;
Drew in London. "Now they are scrambling for other sources of
income and turnover. You can't fault the strategy, but they
need partners to do it."
   Daimler stirred up a small storm last month when it
announced that it was in the initial stages of forging a
loose "technological alliance" with Japan's Mitsubishi
industrial group. It set tongues wagging again last week by
announcing a much more specific move to merge its jet-engine
line with that of Pratt &amp; Whitney, a subsidiary of United
Technologies Corp.
   Daimler appears to be set on going wherever necessary to
get the partners -- and technology -- it needs for market
access. "These linkups suggest Daimler-Benz is getting a step
up the ladder in these new growth areas by joining forces
with other people's technology," says Simon Miller, an
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. in London. In return,
he says, the partners get access to Europe, with the Daimler
name behind them.
   With MBB, Daimler already controls more than 60% of West
Germany's aeronautics technology. But the West German
conglomerate's units are relatively small compared with
either British Aerospace PLC or France's Aerospatiale, making
the need for global partners more urgent.
   Daimler's link with Pratt &amp; Whitney, for instance, is
likely to give it a quick boost into the front rank of global
jet-engine producers. The two companies also are hinting that
the relationship could expand to other United Technologies
divisions, perhaps involving the joint manufacture of
turbochargers.
   The Mitsubishi and United Technologies ventures also
illustrate an aspect of Daimler's strategy that distinguishes
it from many of its European counterparts. While many
Europeans, particularly the French, tend to focus on forging
links with other companies inside the European Community,
Daimler takes a world view.
   "We have now reached a stage where, instead of a project
here and a project there, we wanted a partnership with more
permanency," says Juergen Schrempp, chairman of Deutsche
Aerospace AG, Daimler's aerospace unit, and a member of
Daimler's management board.
   Mr. Schrempp says Daimler is talking about "a number of
concrete projects" with Mitsubishi, including a proposal for
joint development of a 75-seat airliner.
   Besides the draw away from defense, analysts say
"risk-sharing partnerships" have become the order of the day
in civil aviation. Even by pooling Daimler's vast
technological resources in the aerospace field -- which
include not only MBB and Motoren &amp; Turbinen Union G.m.b.H.
but also the Dornier G.m.b.H. aerospace concern -- the
company would be hard pressed to launch a fully independent
venture. And management is against trying to go it alone.
   Against this background, Daimler is still struggling to
reshape itself into an effective conglomerate. It is often
accused of trailing its smaller and more creative
competitors. Critics grumble that the company may be adapting
too quickly to its special position as the nation's favored
defense contractor -- and not making the strides necessary to
break away from the trough of government subsidies.
   MBB was added to a rapid succession of technology and
aerospace acquisitions in 1985, when AEG AG, MTU and Dornier
were taken aboard. The process catapulted Daimler into the
role of West Germany's No. 1 company by sales. But management
has conceded that, since then, the hoped-for synergies
between its automotive business and the technology additions
have been slow in coming. Analysts estimate that in 1989, for
instance, Daimler's nonautomotive business accounted for more
than a third of sales but only a tenth of profits.
   Daimler Chairman Edzard Reuter unveiled his solution in
1988. He broke up the group into three largely autonomous
operations with their own management boards: Mercedes-Benz AG
for autos and trucks; Deutsche Aerospace for aerospace and
defense; and AEG for electronics.
   Philippe Haspeslagh, a business professor at Insead, the
European management school in Paris, says Daimler has
successfully structured its many acquisitions. "But the next
step -- the strategic step of reorienting these new
businesses to survive in the global market -- is very
different, and much more difficult," he says.
   The possible loss of defense contracts won't make the
transition any easier. After the inclusion of MBB, defense
technology accounts for just under half of Deutsche
Aerospace's sales. Among other projects, MBB accounts for 33%
of the four-nation Eurofighter project, designed to phase out
the Tornado as Europe's next generation of jet fighter. AEG
and MTU, for their part, are major contractors in the Tornado
project, as well as in other defense programs. In recent
weeks, Bonn Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has been
facing growing political pressure to shelve the Eurofighter
after its development stage.
   For all of Daimler's worries, Bonn couldn't be happier.
The government braved antitrust protests when pushing through
the sale of MBB to Daimler-Benz late last year, laying the
cornerstone for the badly needed restructuring of West
Germany's scattered aerospace industry. Without the sale,
Bonn officials say, the proposed ventures with Mitsubishi and
United Technologies might never have come about, and an
important growth market would have been lost.
   "Daimler's coordination with America and Japan continues
to improve the value and dimension of the German aerospace
industry," says a defense ministry official. He adds, "It
proves that the Daimler-MBB merger was the right decision."
   Still, antitrust officials in both West Germany and the EC
say they are watching Daimler's activities closely. "Bigness
alone is not a problem," says an EC spokesman, adding that
the important thing is "how a company behaves once it
acquires this sort of position in a national -- and
ultimately the international -- market."

   Tom Werner's Group Agrees

   $75 Million for the Team

   SAN DIEGO -- Will Bill Cosby throw out the first ball?
   Tom Werner, who with partner Marcy Carsey owns and
produces TV shows including "The Bill Cosby Show" and
"Roseanne," has agreed with nine partners to buy the San
Diego Padres baseball team for about $75 million from
McDonald's Corp. heiress Joan Kroc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 39-year-old Mr. Werner, a beneficiary of a hefty chunk
of the some $500 million that "Cosby" netted in syndication,
will be chairman of a general partnership that includes
another Hollywood executive and eight San Diego businessmen.
   Mr. Werner initially pursued the Padres with Russell
Goldsmith, chairman of Republic Pictures Corp., after Mrs.
Kroc put the team up for sale last year. In December they
informally teamed up with another suitor, an investor group
headed by former Coca-Cola Bottling of San Diego president,
Arthur Rivkin, and Arthur Engel, chairman of Southwest Marine
Inc., a ship repair concern.
   The new group, which agreed to bid together in February,
had the advantage of what one partner called the "glue
factor," eight partners who were firmly rooted in the San
Diego community.
   The purchase price was lower than some estimates, which
was that the team would fetch $100 million. Indianapolis
radio magnate Jeff Smulyan paid $81 million for the Seattle
Mariners last year, and the Padres have much higher
attendance -- the team drew more than two million last season
-- and a more successful team. But the buyers of the Padres
were able to argue that the Padres should command a lower
price for several reasons.
   For one thing, the team has high operating expenses,
including eight players who make more than $1 million a year;
the Mariners have one of the lowest payrolls in the game.
Player salaries throughout baseball have been escalating so
rapidly that values of franchises may have come down in
recent months, despite the $13 million annually each team
will reap over the next four years as a result of new
national television contracts.
   Furthermore, unlike some franchises, San Diego's potential
for expanding its local television market has its limits. Its
media market ranks 24th of 26 teams: rather than serving an
entire region like some teams, the Padres are limited by the
Pacific Ocean to the west, the desert to the east, Mexico to
the south and Orange County and Los Angeles to the north,
where the Dodgers and Angels reign. Another factor, according
to a partner, is that Mr. Smulyan has the capability of
moving the team; the Padres have a 10-year lease at Jack
Murphy Stadium and aren't likely to relocate.

   ATLANTA -- President Bush asked broadcasters to support
the U.S. government's new television broadcasts to Cuba,
despite fears Havana may respond with widespread jamming of
American domestic broadcasts.
   Cuba has been jamming signals sent to that country by the
government's new TV Marti television system since the U.S.
began the service late last month. Private broadcasters fear
that Cuba soon may expand its jamming activity to disrupt
frequencies used by private radio and television stations in
the southeast U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I do understand the concerns some of you have about
this," Mr. Bush told the National Association of Broadcasters
convention here. "But I also understand that you represent
the very principle TV Marti exists to serve -- the free flow
of ideas."
   Mr. Bush declared that he doesn't intend to back away from
TV Marti despite Cuba's opposition. He told the convention
that "the voice of freedom will not be stilled as long as
there is an America to tell the truth." He urged the
broadcasters to "stand for TV Marti, to stand for freedom."

   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Tandy Brands Inc. said it is
considering the possible spinoff of its Tandy Brands
Accessories unit as a new publicly traded company.
   The specialty retailer and maker of men's accessories and
neckwear said various regulatory and statutory matters must
be resolved before the spinoff plan is formally adopted. But
if approved, the company said, the plan would call for the
distribution of common stock in the new company to Tandy
Brands stockholders in a tax-free form.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition to Tandy Brands Accessories, a manufacturer
and marketer of mens' and boys' leather accessories and
neckwear, the company also operates Bombay Co., a retailer of
specialty furniture and home accessories. The accessories
division accounts for about 25% of the Tandy Brands' revenues
with the Bombay division accounting for the rest, a company
spokesman said.
   Carson R. Thompson, Tandy Brands chairman and chief
executive, said the spinoff would allow the management of
each company to adopt strategies and pursue objectives
appropriate to its specific business. Last year, Tandy Brands
hired an investment banker to explore the possibility of
selling the entire company, but called off the study after
several months.
   For the six months ended Dec. 31, Tandy Brands reported
net income of $8.2 million, or $1.55 a share, on revenue of
$77.3 million. That was up from net income of $5.7 million,
or $1.43 a share, on revenue of $60.2 million for the same
period a year earlier. The latest six-month period included
$1.7 million in extraordinary tax benefits compared with $1.9
million in similar benefits recorded during the year-earlier
period.

   BONN -- West Germany's industrial production dropped a
seasonally adjusted 0.8% in February from January as energy
output plunged 10% because of warm winter weather, the Bonn
Economics Ministry said.
   Though the unusually mild winter depressed output in the
utility sector, the construction industry benefited and
boosted production 5% during the month. Mining output
increased 1.5%, while production in the manufacturing
industry as a whole was off 0.5%.
</LP>

   January production data were revised upward slightly to
show a 2.1% month-to-month rise, up from a preliminary
increase of 1.7% recorded earlier.
   February's industrial production was 4.2% higher than a
year earlier, the ministry said.

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said U.S. firms will
no longer have to apply for export licenses to ship
low-capacity computer hard-disk drives to most non-communist
countries.
   Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said that freeing these products from
unnecessary paperwork would "enable U.S. manufacturers to
compete on an equal footing with foreign competitors who
don't face any exporting constraints." The order will take
effect tomorrow.
</LP>

   The department's latest move to liberalize technology
trade within the western bloc covers hard-disk drives with a
capacity of up to 45 megabytes of memory. Nearly all personal
computers are equipped with such built-in data-storage
devices. The department estimates that U.S. shipments of
these products were valued at close to $500 million last
year.
   The department decided to ease licensing requirements for
these products after determining that drives of comparable
quality are being widely traded by countries that don't
participate in export controls adopted by the U.S. and its
allies.
   The department said it will continue to require export
licenses for shipment of these products to the Soviet Union
and Eastern European countries, pending changes in export
rules by the U.S. and its allies.

   NEW YORK -- Horn &amp; Hardart Co. said it will sell its East
Coast restaurant holdings, which include Bojangles' Fried
Chicken &amp; Biscuits, Tony Roma's and Arby's.
   A Horn &amp; Hardart spokesman said the company has held
discussions with potential buyers of the assets. But he
declined to say how much Horn &amp; Hardart expected to net from
the chains, which should be sold by year's end. The group
includes 51 company-operated restaurants; they represented
about $95 million of Horn &amp; Hardart's 1988 revenue, which
totaled $500 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the company's East Coast holdings are sold, Horn &amp;
Hardart's remaining restaurant operations will consist of
International King's Table Inc., a West Coast-based chain of
83 restaurants that the company plans to keep.
   Horn &amp; Hardart said it is selling the restaurants to focus
on Hanover Cos., its direct marketing subsidiary, which
generated $316 million of revenue in 1988. "The opportunities
presented by the direct marketing industry make it advisable
to focus our financial and human capital in that direction,"
said Donald Schupak, Horn &amp; Hardart's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Horn &amp; Hardart agreed to sell to Burger King Corp., a unit
of Grand Metropolitan PLC, its franchise and territorial
rights to operate Burger King restaurants in the New York
area. Horn &amp; Hardart is also proceeding with a plan to sell
its New York City real-estate assets and Las Vegas casino
interest.

   If U.S. Succeeds in Japan Trade Talks,
   American Consumer May Be the Loser

   WASHINGTON -- If the U.S. has its way in the latest round
of its trade talks with Japan, the likely loser will be the
U.S. consumer.
   If the U.S. succeeds, there will be winners on both sides
of the Pacific. Japanese consumers and U.S. producers both
would benefit from a more open and competitive Japanese
market. But the U.S. consumer would be stuck with some of the
bill for opening the Japanese market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trade imbalance between the U.S. and Japan -- the
world's two largest economies -- is so intractable that each
now is reaching into the internal affairs of the other. The
aim is to address the root causes of the $50 billion annual
trade imbalance between the two nations. The U.S. believes
one major way of correcting its trade deficit is to strike an
alliance with the long-neglected Japanese consumer. Let the
Japanese buy what they want at fair prices, the argument
goes, and the deficit will begin to shrink.
   But the flip side of that argument may not play so well at
home. It is, essentially, to agree that the U.S. consumer has
had it too easy, and implement a variety of belt-tightening
measures. "I think we'd concede that we in the U.S. have
tilted too much to consumer end, but they've tilted too much
to producer end," says S. Linn Williams, deputy White House
trade representative and one of the three lead U.S.
negotiators in the talks.
   The U.S. strategy is being tested here this week during
the Structural Impediment Initiative talks. The current round
in the nine-month-old series of talks is crucial because it's
scheduled to produce an interim report this month on how each
country will address the underlying causes of the stubborn
trade imbalance between them.
   The stakes in these talks are huge, U.S. negotiators say.
"If the global trading system is to be preserved and expanded
as it has to be, it has to be clear that the same rules and
opportunities apply to everybody," says the State
Department's Richard McCormack. He, Mr. Williams and the
Treasury's Charles Dallara head the U.S. delegation. The
price of failure, the U.S. side contends, would be a
destructive spiral of protectionist trade restrictions.
   Watching the SII talks, and growing uneasy, are U.S.
politicians. Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.) last week introduced
legislation mandating that if the talks fail to yield
results, trade-related issues would be pursued through
investigations under Section 301 of the 1988 trade act. Such
investigations carry the threat of future trade retaliation.
   The Japanese are increasingly fearful of U.S. trade
retaliation. To ensure that current bilateral trade talks are
on track, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu called
President Bush yesterday morning to say he had dispatched two
special emissaries to Washington. The emissaries, former
Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Noburo Matsunaga and Deputy
Foreign Minister Hisashi Owada, met yesterday with National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State James
Baker. They are to see Mr. Bush tomorrow when he returns from
a speaking trip in the Midwest.
   The increasingly consumer-oriented approach -- up with the
Japanese version, and down with the American -- may yet save
the day. Recent polls show that many Japanese agree with the
kinds of market-opening reforms the U.S. is urging on Japan,
and disagree with their government's contention that the
problem lies simply in Americans saving too little and
consuming too much.
   The more-open Japanese markets that the U.S. is seeking
probably will lead to lower prices, greater competition and a
rise in Japan's standard of living. A recent survey showed
that many foreign goods were on average 70% more expensive in
Japan than in the U.S.
   The Japanese have now developed proposals that go some way
toward meeting U.S. demands. Japan is prepared to alter a law
that effectively forces outsiders to wait 10 years to get
into the large retail-store market. Another proposal would
boost Japanese spending on roads, bridges and other
infrastructure. In recent separate trade talks on
supercomputers and sophisticated telecommunications
equipment, the Japanese have shown a greater willingness to
make market-opening moves.
   The SII talks, of course, aren't dealing only with
Japanese impediments. "It's a two-way street," says
Treasury's Mr. Dallara. Japanese negotiators have come up
with a list of 80 points they think could help the U.S. cut
its budget deficit, improve its savings rate, promote
exports, improve educational standards and make industry
think longer-term. The Japanese suggested, among other
things, that the Bush administration seek to limit the number
of credit cards individual citizens can hold.

   Well, Lots of Off-the-Wall Moves
   End Up Less Than Picture Perfect

   PITTSBURGH -- Things of beauty aren't always joys forever.
   Ask USX Corp. Apparently forgetting that public relations
is also an art form, the steel and energy giant packed up 64
valuable paintings that had adorned its headquarters and sent
them off to Christie's for auction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move has shocked local art buffs, but the company's
reasoning was simple: A sale, which could reap more than $4
million in today's world of escalating art values, was in the
best interest of shareholders. (One holder in particular,
investor Carl Icahn, is breathing down the company's neck,
demanding that it restructure to get greater stock value.)
   "Shareholders are not well served -- nor am I comfortable
-- having paintings worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on
the walls of executive offices," explains USX Chairman
Charles A. Corry.
   Then hang the paintings in local museums, shout art
aficionados. Get a tax write-off and be a hero instead of a
heel.
   "It's a loss to the city," laments Leon A. Arkus, who put
the collection together when he was director of the Carnegie
Museum of Art. The collection is believed to be the
third-largest in the city, behind only the Carnegie and Frick
museums, and includes noted works of Mary Cassatt, Robert
Motherwell and Childe Hassam.
   Can't the museum go and bid on the pieces themselves?
"Sure we can go to Christie's -- and sit and watch because we
don't have the money," says DeCourcy E. McIntosh, executive
director of the Helen Clay Frick Foundation, which operates
the Frick Art Museum.
   What really galls the local art community is that USX will
make millions while the Carnegie -- which helped put the
collection together for free -- doesn't get a thing. "It's
not fair," pouts a local art expert.
   The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran an editorial: "We can't
imagine that the corporation is so pressed for cash that its
executives couldn't donate" at least part of the collection.
   USX counters that two years ago it donated $1.5 million to
the Carnegie, which includes the natural-history museum as
well as the library. Moreover, many employees have
participated in local fund-raising efforts to assist cultural
institutions.
   And not everyone even liked the paintings. "I didn't see
any executives throwing themselves across the doorway saying
`Please, don't take the paintings away,'" says a USX
spokesman.

   PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny International Inc. said that a

its reorganization plan to emerge from Chapter 11 protection.
But the consumer products concern said it did not receive the
necessary two-thirds majority in all creditor classes due to
negative votes by Japonica Partners and its affiliates.
   As a result, Allegheny International said it will file a
lawsuit to disallow the votes of Japonica, a New York-based
investment group that has filed its own reorganization plan.

   Ahmanson Agrees
   To Buy for Stock

   LOS ANGELES -- H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. said it reached a
definitive agreement to acquire Home Savings Bank of New York
in a stock swap valued at about $300 million.
   Under the agreement, Home of New York shareholders will
receive Ahmanson common stock with a market value equal to
about $25 a share for each of the 12 million Home of New York
shares outstanding, subject to adjustments. The $25 price is
about 1.2 times Home of New York's book value of $20.11 a
share, or on the lower end of what healthy thrifts have been
fetching recently. At a $25-a-share value, the transaction
would involve about 17 million shares of Ahmanson, which had
about 99.3 million shares outstanding at Dec. 31.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Home of
New York shares jumped $3.875 to $18.875 on volume of 830,800
shares. Ahmanson closed at $17.375, down 12.5 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Ahmanson said the merger would allow it to expand its
savings and mortgage lending operations in the New York area,
the company's second largest market after California. Under
the agreement, Ahmanson would combine Homes of New York with
its Bowery Savings Bank unit.
   The proposed merger won't create major overlaps, Ahmanson
said, and branch closings aren't expected. Home of New York,
based in Bayside, Queens, has 13 offices, assets of $1.6
billion, and deposits of $1.15 billion. The Bowery has 26
branches and deposits of $5 billion. Ahmanson, parent of Home
Savings of America, the nation's largest thrift, has total
assets of about $44.6 billion.
   Ahmanson said Home of New York had 1989 net income of
$19.1 million, or $1.58 a share, compared with profit of
$24.1 million, or $2 a share, in 1988. It said Home of New
York's return on assets, a key indicator of profitability,
was a robust 1.18% in 1989, and that its capital levels
substantially exceeded regulatory minimums.
   The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and
approval of Home of New York shareholders. Ahmanson said it
expects the transaction to close by year-end.
   Terms also call for Home of New York directors to become
directors of Bowery. Richard Kraemer, chairman, president and
chief executive officer of Home of New York, will become
chairman and chief executive officer of The Bowery, and an
executive vice president of Ahmanson. He will also become a
director of Ahmanson's Home Savings of America unit.
   Ahmanson said the final share price in the transaction may
vary, depending on the average closing price of its common
for the 10 trading days prior to the day the last required
regulatory approval for the transaction is obtained. If
Ahmanson's average stock price is greater than or equal to
$24.64 a share, the market value of shares issued to Home of
New York shareholders will be $28 a share. If Ahmanson's
average stock price is less than, or equal to $16.92 a share,
Home of New York may decide it won't complete the
transaction.

   Many Scientists Still Give `Cold Fusion'
   Cold Shoulder a Year After Initial Claim

<LP>
   SALT LAKE CITY -- "Cold fusion" researchers are beginning
to suspect that more than one kind of nuclear reaction may be
occurring in their controversial experiments.
   But while skeptical scientists call some of the latest
findings "interesting," they say the cold-fusion researchers
have yet to produce convincing evidence of any kind of
nuclear reactions at all in their experiments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thus stands the cold-fusion debate after a three-day
meeting to mark the first anniversary of a claim that a
simple table-top apparatus was producing more energy than it
was consuming, apparently by the fusion of hydrogen atoms at
room temperature. That announcement by British chemist Martin
Fleischmann and his University of Utah colleague, B. Stanley
Pons, implying the discovery of a new energy source, set off
a world-wide scientific furor that continues.
   The conference focused on scientists who have continued to
do cold-fusion research and have come up with more or less
positive experimental results. Largely absent were the scores
of scientists whose attempts to reproduce the cold-fusion
experiments last year failed and who believe that Messrs.
Fleischmann and Pons were mistaken. The conference was
organized by the National Cold Fusion Institute set up at the
University of Utah last fall with $5 million appropriated by
the state legislature to exploit the cold-fusion discovery.
   Reports from more than 40 different laboratories indicated
that a small but growing number of scientists believe they
are seeing entirely new phenomena in the cold-fusion
experiments. "There is a growing consensus that you can't
explain the phenomena by errors" in the experiments, declared
Ernest B. Yeager, member of a Case Western Reserve University
team that reported significant amounts of excess heat energy
and tritium, a triply heavy form of hydrogen, coming out of
cold-fusion devices.
   "At least 25 laboratories throughout the world have
achieved positive results," said Edmund Storms of the Los
Alamos National Laboratory who recently reported detecting
tritium in cold-fusion experiments. "We can put aside the
question of whether it is a real phenomenon or not," Mr.
Storms said.
   But John Huizenga, professor of chemistry and physics at
the University of Rochester, said he heard nothing during the
conference that would change the conclusions last November of
an ad hoc committee of scientists set up by the Department of
Energy to evaluate the cold-fusion experiments. Mr. Huizenga
was co-chairman of the now-disbanded committee, which
concluded that "the present evidence for the discovery of a
new nuclear process termed cold fusion isn't persuasive."
   Most current cold-fusion experiments are more
sophisticated versions of the original Pons-Fleischmann
devices. A thin rod of palladium encircled by a coil of
platinum wire is immersed in "heavy" water in which the
hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium.
When an electric current is applied to the apparatus the
heavy water molecules begin to break up into deuterium and
oxygen atoms in a classical electrolysis-of-water process.
Many of the deuterium atoms liberated from the heavy water
are "soaked up" by the palladium rod.
   A recent count found 16 laboratories have reported
measuring excess energy coming from a total of 40
electrolytic cells, David H. Worledge of the utility
industry's Electric Power Research Institute told the
conference. Five of the laboratories have claimed measuring
high levels of excess heat energy, he said.
   Mr. Worledge said he counted seven laboratories that have
reported finding tritium in 22 different cells, including
groups at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Texas A&amp;M
University in the U.S. and the Bhabha Atomic Research Center
near Bombay, India. He also cited reports from at least three
laboratories of detecting neutrons coming in short-lived
bursts from cold-fusion experiments, albeit at extremely low
levels.
   But even scientists who believe these measurements are
reliable said the reports make cold fusion even more baffling
than before. The number of tritium atoms being counted
indicated that fusion reactions can account for only about 5%
of the excess heat being measured, the researchers said.
Moreover, for every tritium atom produced there should be a
neutron, yet the number of tritium atoms outnumber the
neutrons being detected by as much as 100 million to one.
   Adding to the confusion were indications that the heat and
tritium mightn't be produced at the same time or by the same
reaction. Several scientists, including Mr. Fleischmann,
suggested that different "mechanisms" may be at work. "The
two processes {heat and tritium} seem to be caused by two
different events," Mr. Storms of Los Alamos said.
   Cold-fusion advocate John Bockris of Texas A&amp;M argued that
the tritium found in his experiments appeared to be coming
from nuclear reactions occurring on the surface of the
palladium rods, probably on microscopic pimples called
dendrites that seem to form on the palladium during an
experiment.
   The heat, on the other hand, may be coming from some
reaction inside the palladium rods. Charles D. Scott of the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee said a cold-fusion
cell in his laboratory produced heat for as long as 200 hours
at a time at a level far greater than could be explained by
any chemical reactions. He also detected tritium as well as
neutrons and gamma radiation in the experiment.
   During some of these heat-producing periods, the Oak Ridge
scientists siphoned out the heavy water and replaced it with
ordinary water composed of "light" hydrogen atoms and oxygen.
The heat production began to die down, indicating the heavy
deuterium atoms are necessary to whatever nuclear reaction is
going on. It took several hours, however, before the cell was
no longer producing excess power. This suggested that nuclear
reactions were still occurring among deuterium atoms trapped
inside the rod.
   Critics at the conference remained skeptical. "I'm here
because I find it extremely interesting but I'm as skeptical
now as I was at the beginning if not more so," said Richard
Petrasso of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He said
that the reports of neutrons could easily be the result of
faults in neutron detectors and the reports of tritium, even
if accurate, couldn't explain the claims of excess heat.
   The cold-fusion researchers conceded their biggest problem
is that they still cannot turn their experiments on and off
at will. The experiments turn on at completely unpredictable
times and no one yet has figured out what triggers them.
   Many scientists will remain skeptical "until we can give
them a recipe so they can reproduce {the experiments} in
their own labs on their own equipment," said Howard Menlove
of the Los Alamos laboratory. "I hope that it {the recipe}
will come within the next six to 12 months," he added.

   Still Feels Region's Pinch
   Despite Safer Strategy

   Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, widely considered one of
the New England banks least vulnerable to the region's real
estate problems, said it will post a sharp increase in
troubled loans.
   The Providence, R.I. bank holding company estimated that
nonperforming assets grew 50% to $600 million at the end of
the first quarter, and indicated that a continuing
examination by state and federal regulators may well result
in further increases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fitch Investors Service yesterday warned that
Fleet/Norstar's troubled assets could reach $875 million, or
about 4% of related assets, compared with $400 million, or
1.8%, at Dec. 31.
   Jack Flynn, executive vice president and chief financial
officer at Fleet/Norstar, said that and similar estimates by
other analysts -- ranging from $700 million to $1 billion --
have been made by comparing the size of Fleet/Norstar's
commercial real estate portfolio with those of banks that
have been examined recently. Asked to comment on Fitch's
estimate, Mr. Flynn said, "I hope they're wrong."
   Fleet/Norstar's disclosure marks the latest in a string of
setbacks for New England's biggest banks that began last
fall, as federal examiners started scouring the banks'
commercial real estate portfolios. Partly because
Fleet/Norstar curtailed condominium-construction loans in
1987 and has an unusually diversified earnings base, analysts
say it is likely to remain less affected than others by the
region's real-estate slump. But yesterday's announcement
shows that the bank, the region's second largest with $33
billion in total assets, is far from immune to the region's
general malaise.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Fleet/Norstar's shares fell 62.5 cents to close at $21.25, on
heavy volume of more than 1.8 million, following the early
morning announcement. Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
yesterday lowered ratings on a number of Fleet/Norstar's debt
securities, citing the spreading problems in commercial real
estate.
   Even if Fitch's estimate of problem loans proves accurate,
Fleet/Norstar would remain better off than its major New
England competitors. At year-end 1989, nonperforming assets
were 5.4% of related assets for Shawmut National Corp., 6.6%
for Bank of Boston Corp., the region's largest bank, and 9.5%
for Bank of New England Corp.
   Thaddeus Paluszek, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.,
said the growth in troubled loans at Fleet/Norstar isn't
"disastrous." He added, "That's a sizable increase. But I
think it has to be framed in a context that is relative to
other New England banks. I don't think a financial
institution in a soft economic environment can be totally
immune."
   Fleet/Norstar said it may delay reporting first-quarter
results, normally announced in mid-April, if regulatory
examinations of its operating units aren't finished by then.
The company said the exams are expected to be completed by
the end of the month.
   Mr. Flynn said that most of the estimated increase in
nonperforming assets comes from real estate loans in the
company's banking subsidiaries. "The key real estate
portfolios are {in the} Providence and Buffalo" units, Mr.
Flynn said, adding that "we haven't gotten much feedback"
from the regulators on those units yet.
   Although Fleet/Norstar was examined just last fall, U.S.
Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke said earlier this
year that his agency wanted to take a closer look at the
company's real estate portfolios in light of the continued
deterioration in the Northeast market.
   At the time, Mr. Clarke said Fleet/Norstar had expressed
interest in possibly buying banking units from troubled Bank
of New England, but that he wouldn't be able to approve such
a transaction until Fleet/Norstar had been examined again.
   Mr. Flynn said yesterday that the anticipated increase in
problem loans "will not affect our interest and we do not
believe it will affect our ability" to buy other banking
units. But "those are things you have to look at constantly
and continue to make judgments as to where you stand," he
said.
   Mr. Paluszek of Kidder Peabody said the company might be
better off not buying parts of Bank of New England now. "My
pesonal feeling is {Fleet/Norstar} would be better served to
maintain its position and mind its own store rather than
expand its position in a soft market."
   Meanwhile, Fleet/Norstar moved to cushion itself against a
possible increase in its loan-loss reserves, which stood at
$341 million, or 86% of nonperforming assets at year end.
   Mr. Flynn said the company will record a pretax gain in
the first quarter of about $40 million from the sale of $200
million of its $450 million credit-card portfolio to Norwest
Corp., Minneapolis. The company also will have a pretax gain
of about $50 million from a change in the investment
structure of its pension plan, Mr. Flynn said.
   A number of banks recently have sold credit-card
portfolios to larger servicers, and Fleet said maintaining
its relatively small portfolio "would place us at a
disadvantage with respect to cost economies." Mr. Flynn said
the company plans to retain the $150 million in credit-card
accounts belonging to people who have other banking
relationships with Fleet/Norstar. But "we may well sell" the
remaining $100 million or so of the portfolio in the second
quarter, he said.

   Plans to Retire on May 1

   Xerox Corp. said its president, Paul Allaire, will succeed
David Kearns as chief executive officer Aug. 1 with Mr.
Kearns remaining as chairman.
   At the same time, Xerox said Vice Chairman Melvin Howard,
who heads Xerox Financial Services, will retire May 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Mr. Allaire's succession had been expected since
1986 when he was named president and heir apparent, the
retirement of the 55-year-old Mr. Howard came as a surprise.
Analysts interpreted both moves as signaling the company's
satisfaction with its recent emphasis on its core business
equipment operations and growing disillusionment with
financial services. Several analysts suggested Xerox
Financial Services is now ripe for piecemeal selling, a move
long favored by Wall Street.
   After years of missteps and disappointments, Xerox, based
in Stamford, Conn., has been performing relatively well
lately, especially in copiers, printers and other
document-processing equipment. It posted a $212 million
profit on revenue of $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of
1989, compared with a $77 million loss on revenue of $4.4
billion in the year-earlier period. The 1988 fourth quarter
results included a one-time restructuring charge of $244
million.
   But dismal results in the financial-services sector have
masked this progress, and the firm has been troubled by its
investments in VMS Realty Partners, a Chicago real estate
concern being rocked by lawsuits and liquidity problems.
   Though he was considered a long-shot candidate for the
chief executive's post, Mr. Howard didn't decide to retire
because he was passed over, a company spokesman said. Nor did
his retirement have anything to do with the VMS Realty
imbroglio, the spokesman added.
   Mr. Howard, who was unavailable for comment, will be
succeeded as head of Xerox Financial Services by Stewart
Ross, the company's senior vice president and chief financial
officer.
   Mr. Allaire, 51, has been strongly associated with Xerox's
recent successes, and has distanced himself from its
failures. A 24-year Xerox veteran, he made his name during
two stints at Rank Xerox, the company's London-based
marketing and services subsidiary. Faced with strong Japanese
rivals, he used a hands-on approach to cut costs by $200
million and re-establish the company's competitiveness. By
1980, he had risen to Rank Xerox's top position, managing
director.
   In 1983, Mr. Allaire returned to the U.S. as senior vice
president and chief staff officer. He was elected president,
traditionally a waiting room for CEOs-to-be, three years
later, and since then has overseen the company's business
equipment operation.
   Over the past year or so, this operation has re-emerged as
Xerox's core strategic business, providing a boost for Mr.
Allaire. Meanwhile, the company's move to financial services,
promoted by Mr. Kearns in the early 1980s as an antidote to
Xerox's then-declining market share in copiers, has seemed
destined for an ever-decreasing role.
   "They got into that business when their backs were against
the wall," said Alex Henderson, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "There's no strategic value
in it any more."
   By stepping aside as chief executive but staying as
chairman, Mr. Kearns follows a tradition established by Xerox
founder Joseph Wilson: At age 60, top officers relinquish
day-to-day responsibilities and make way for their
successors. Mr. Kearns will be 60 on Aug. 11.
   The Xerox spokesman said Mr. Kearns intends to stay
involved in the company, albeit much more on an advisory
basis than previously. Many Xerox watchers speculated that
Mr. Kearns will eventually find his way to a high government
post, perhaps secretary of education. He currently serves on
the President's Education Policy Advisory Committee, and has
written a book on reforming the U.S. public school system.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Xerox closed at $55.375, down 25 cents.

   Women are the world's invisible work force, the United
Nations International Labor Organization said in a report.
   Millions of working women are simply ignored in labor
statistics, giving a distorted view of reality and leading to
misguided economic policies or even the neglect of women in
development strategies, the report said. These legions of
"invisible" women can be found everywhere from Third World
agriculture to family businesses in industrial nations such
as Britain and France, it added.
   "Data specific to agricultural sectors, where women are
traditionally active, are particularly suspect and suggest
that women are simply not being counted," the report said.
   Many countries admitted they excluded women in agriculture
from their statistics. Algeria, for one, said it had excluded
1.2 million such women, probably unpaid workers on family
farms.

   Singapore proposed a law to stop what it considers
aggressive evangelism. Critics say the bill, which could ban
people from preaching or editing religious publications, is
intended to silence political dissent. But the government
responded in a report, "University students have been
harassed by over-zealous Christian students." It added, "In
hospitals, some doctors and medical students have tried to

   BAD NEWS FOR UNESCO
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. and Britain are expected to announce they won't
rejoin the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization because they remain unhappy about its
management. Unesco sources said the British announcement was
likely this week, possibly today, while the U.S. would reject
the agency later this month. The U.S. and Britain, which took
away some 30% of Unesco's funding when they left in 1985, are
said to believe Unesco's Spanish director-general, Federico
Mayor, has failed to correct what they say is the
organization's anti-Western bias.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN EXPORTS FEWER VCRS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's exports of videocassette recorders and
color-television sets fell in February from a year earlier,
the Electronics Industry Association of Japan reported. A
total of 1.77 million VCRs were exported in February, down
6.3% from the February 1989 figure of 1.89 million. A total
of 255,704 Japanese color TV sets were exported in February,
down 23.1% from 332,499 units last year. An association
spokesman said the continuing trend toward increased overseas
production by Japanese manufacturers was a principal reason
for the declining figures.
                                                                                                       

   SPAIN'S OLYMPIC PREPARATIONS
                                                                                                       

   Spain has created a special government commission to
oversee preparations for the Barcelona 1992 Olympics. A
spokesman for Spain's Socialist government said the
commission was designed to give maximum political backing to
the Olympics and ensure that preparations for them go
smoothly. Disagreements between local politicians over
financing and other issues have led to delays in projects
connected with the Olympics, including a new highway from
Barcelona's airport and a subway line to the Olympic stadium.
                                                                                                       

   JORDAN RECALLS OFFICIALS
                                                                                                       

   Jordan is recalling 40 non-diplomatic officials from
embassies in Western countries. Foreign Ministry
Secretary-General Mutasem Bilbeisi said the move was designed
to cut a projected budget deficit of $299.5 million this year
by $5 million. Jordan has a foreign debt of $8.30 billion.
Mr. Bilbeisi said those affected by the decision are
counselors, cultural officials and other representatives who
aren't officially part of the diplomatic corps.
                                                                                                       

   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
                                                                                                       

   The European Community submitted a detailed proposal to
trade negotiators for new international rules to protect
rights to intellectual property such as patents, copyrights
and trademarks.
   The proposal, presented in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva, aims to fight increasing
counterfeiting and piracy. New accords on
intellectual-property rights and other sectors of world trade
are due to be signed by GATT's 96 members in December after
four years of negotiations.
   The EC's draft would protect patents for 20 years.
Copyrighting is protected for 25 to 50 years, and the initial
registration of a trademark would be valid for 10 years under
the proposal.
   The U.S., the EC and Japan have pressed for more stringent
intellectual-property rules. By contrast, some developing
countries led by India have argued that ready access to
information is essential to their development and shouldn't
be controlled through GATT.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   April snow fell on Jerusalem yesterday for the third time
in 120 years but quickly melted. Israeli weather officials
said previous April falls were recorded in 1870 and 1949. . .
. A survey by one of West Germany's largest coffee companies
found that 95% of West German women in the 25-to-40-year-old
age group want to wake up Sunday mornings to romantic "little
morning kisses" and some 81% liked the idea of being served
coffee and crispy rolls. But making love along with the
kisses was the choice of only 26%. The survey didn't ask
men's opinions.

   WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision withdrew a
rule that hampered savings-and-loan owners that tried to
market other financial products to their S&amp;L customers.
   The Association of Thrift Holding Companies, a trade
group, filed a suit challenging the rule in December, when it
went into effect. The association told the federal court in
Washington it will withdraw the suit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The regulation was intended to insure privacy of
depositors, the thrift office said. It required
thrift-holding companies to obtain written permission from
S&amp;L customers before the parent company or other affiliate
could mail marketing for other financial services, such as
insurance, to those customers. The association argued that
the rule was cumbersome and unworkable, and that bank-holding
companies don't face the same restriction.
   The regulation, said Patrick Forte, president of the trade
group, "has damaged the attractiveness of some thrifts to
potential buyers."
   A spokesman for the thrift office said the regulators are
likely to propose a new regulation that replaces the old in
some form. "We are still committed to the principle outlined
in the regulation as far as disclosing customer records," he
said. "We did find there was good reason to take another look
at the implementation of the regulation."

   The three-month long collapse of the Japanese stock market
continued yesterday. The Nikkei Index fell 6.59% Monday after
dropping 3.37% on Friday. Monday's plunge was the second
worst in the history of the Tokyo exchange, and may well mark
the end of one of the most spectacular bull markets in recent
history. It also reminds us that the Japanese are, after all,
governed by the same economic forces as the rest of the human
race.
   In the five years between December 1984 and December 1989,
the Nikkei Index rose 237% and the yen rose 75%. In dollars,
the market provided a 42.7% compound annual rate of return.
The rise in stock prices far outpaced corporate earnings,
pushing the price-earnings ratio to a stratospheric 53 by the
end of 1987. (The U.S. ratio was then 14.4.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo market's rise was propelled by the swift drop in
Japan's import bill. Slumping oil prices -- a barrel that
cost an average of $29.37 in 1984 was available for an
average of $16.42 in 1986 -- helped improve Japan's terms of
trade by 33.7% over those two years. In yen terms, Japan
spent 4% less on imports in 1985 than it had in 1984, and 31%
less in 1986 than it had in 1985. It takes a long time for a
highly competitive economy to respond to changes of this
magnitude. It took Japan even longer.
   While the Japanese wholesale price index fell by 1.1% in
1985 and 9.1% in 1986, the consumer price index rose by 2% in
1985 and 0.6% in 1986. Meanwhile, real wages grew only 0.7%
in 1985 and 2.3% in 1986. Clearly, someone else in the
country was reaping the major benefits of the oil price drop.
   That someone was the corporate sector. Because consumers
and workers enjoyed little improvement in their incomes in
1984-1986, they were unable to increase their consumption of
foreign goods. Japan's current account surplus was achieved
by denying the Japanese worker and consumer the benefits of
the country's increased income. Japan's current account
surplus grew to $86 billion in 1986 from $35 billion in 1984.
This large increase in the inflow of funds must, by the rules
of national income accounting, be counterbalanced by an
outflow through the nation's capital account or an increase
in the reserves of the central bank.
   So money was pouring into the country. Instead of causing
increased spending on imports, it stayed in the corporate
sector. Comparatively cheap stocks, bonds and real estate
abroad lured it back out of the country, this time through
the capital account.
   Now place yourself in the position of a Japanese
institutional investor in 1986. Historically, the Japanese
stock market has been a better investment than foreign
markets. In any case, you have little experience investing
abroad and you tend to make decisions by committee. Your own
market has been going up and the U.S. dollar has fallen in
value -- to 153 yen by August 1986 from 264 yen in February
1985 -- depreciating all of your foreign investments.
   Foreign brokers come to you on a weekly basis and explain
to you that P-E ratios are important and Japan is overvalued,
but all you see is that your Japanese investments increase in
value and your foreign investments fall in value. No wonder
you continue to purchase Japanese investments even though you
may suspect that you should pay attention to standard
international comparisons of value.
   This pricing disequilibrium could continue as long as
Japan ran large current account surpluses. Because the amount
of money that had to be channeled abroad was so large, and
because the Japanese were new to the international investment
scene, a huge difference emerged between the valuation of
Japanese assets and those in the rest of the world.
   So far, the story corresponds to the worst worries of the
"the Japanese are different]" school of thought. But not for
long. Out of sight of the protectionists in the U.S.
Congress, the Japanese political economy was changing
dramatically. First, in a misguided attempt to control
exchange rates, then Secretary of the Treasury James Baker
pressured Japan into abandoning its prudent management of
monetary affairs in order to stabilize the dollar at the
Louvre in February 1987. The growth in the Japanese money
supply, until then a steady, non-inflationary 7% to 8%,
suddenly accelerated to nearly 11% during 1987-89. People had
more money to spend on all goods, including imports.
   Then market forces began to make themselves felt in Japan.
The long-suffering worker and consumer started to receive
some benefits: Real wages increased 3.3% in 1988 and about
2.4% in 1989. Due largely to the huge increase in the yen's
value, import volumes swelled dramatically, rising 37.5%
between 1986 and 1989. Japan's vaunted export machine was
able to achieve only a 9.5% increase in export volumes over
the same period.
   The current account surplus stopped growing, and then
actually began to shrink. After rocketing upward to a peak of
$87 billion in 1987 from its 1985 level of $49.2 billion, the
surplus should fall to about $40 billion this year.
   This is the fundamental cause of the collapse of the
Japanese stock market. The liquidity buildup caused by the
current account surplus is disappearing as the higher income
Japan earned in the 1980s finally gets spent by the labor
force. All the other forces to which the fall has been
attributed are simply manifestations of this one fundamental
fact.
   For example, the president of the Bank of Japan Yasushi
Mieno has raised interest rates in order to hold up the value
of the yen and reduce inflation. He was impelled to do so
first, by the reduction in investable funds because of the
decline of the current account surplus, and, second, because
of the excessive monetary growth after the Louvre Accord. At
first, excessive liquidity helped to fuel the overvaluation
of Japanese securities. It is now the cause of the downward
pressure on the yen and the upward pressure on inflation.
Japan, like Britain, is a victim of the macroeconomic
imbalances caused by trying to fix an exchange rate at the
wrong level.
   The Ministry of Finance may indeed, as Japan's critics
speculate, try to manipulate its rules and force major
financial institutions into maintaining the value of the
stock market, and it may briefly succeed. All the same, the
market will ultimately have to recede to more normal
valuations. What level would be normal?
   In 1985, Japanese domestic inflation was 2%, the current
account surplus was $49 billion, interest rates averaged
5.9%, the price of oil was $28 per barrel and the market
finished the year on a P-E ratio of 26. In 1989, inflation
was 2.3% and probably rising, while the current account
surplus was $57 billion and falling. Interest rates are now
touching 7.2% and the price of oil is $20 per barrel.
   In short, the major macroeconomic statistics are roughly
equivalent to those of 1985 -- but in 1985 they were trending
up and today they are trending down. The Nikkei would have to
fall to the 18,000 to 20,000 range for equities to return to
a P-E ratio of 26. (Japanese ratios ought to be higher than
those of the U.S. because of the higher rates of economic and
productivity growth expected in Japan.)
   Taken by themselves, the implications for the U.S. market
from a fall in the Japanese are not that great. If your
neighbor's house were inadvertently valued at a price triple
that of other similar houses in your area, it would do you no
harm when the price anomaly was corrected. The repricing of
the Japanese stock market is merely one effect of the
dwindling Japanese current account. A few of the other
predictable effects are a reduction in the U.S. trade
deficit, a weaker yen and less Japanese direct investment
abroad. If the U.S. stock market falls, it will be because of
the severe monetary squeeze which the U.S. economy is
currently undergoing, and not because of the slump in Tokyo
prices.
   The Japanese market has been an enigma for foreign
investors for the past five years. It effortlessly went from
one new high to another in contravention of all the rules
about investing that apply outside of Japan. This was
genuinely peculiar behavior, but it could not last.
Eventually Japan's market had to obey the same rules that
govern investment everywhere else in the world.

   A stronger dollar helped clobber Tokyo stocks which, in
turn, pulled U.S. stock prices modestly lower.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6.76 points to close
at 2700.45 in light trading. Analysts noted that while
selling pressure wasn't intense, there was little buying.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange far outpaced
gainers, 1,122 to 434.

   The dollar forged higher in earlier overseas trading, but
lost most of those gains in New York. Bond prices eased
slightly.
   Analysts said the surging dollar played a role in
yesterday's Tokyo stock market plunge. The Nikkei Index of
225 selected issues posted its second-largest loss ever in
falling 1,978.38 to 28,002.07, its lowest level since
November 1988. Also contributing was a Japanese newspaper
report that insurance companies in Japan will sell much of
their stock portfolios.
   The sharp drop in Tokyo share prices carried over to some
extent to European trading, setting up the U.S. stock market
for a nosedive on the opening bell. The Dow Jones industrials
plummeted about 27 points in the first few minutes of
trading, then stabilized before regaining about 10 points of
the lost ground. But trading was sluggish throughout the day
and only in the final minutes did the Dow industrials regain
the 2700 mark.
   The dollar briefly rose above 160 yen in early Far Eastern
trading. Later, rumors that the Bank of Japan will raise
interest rates again prompted traders to take profits,
although skeptics said such a move is unlikely.
   Bond prices drifted in a relatively narrow range in light
trading. Despite Tokyo's problems, there was little flight to
quality in the U.S. Treasury market. A national purchasing
managers' survey on the industrial economy for March showed
that although economic activity is picking up, the economy
overall is contracting.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices slid in light trading. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 124.4 million shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices eased. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost less than an eighth of a point, or less than $1.25 for
each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue stood at
8.62%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was modestly higher. In late New York trading
the currency was quoted at 1.7009 marks and 158.95 yen,
compared to 1.6940 marks and 158.35 yen Friday.

   It turns out we were off by two years when we ended an
editorial with those words on November 10, 1986. The 101st
Congress is the one that now gets to clean up the mess
produced by the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration "reform" of 1986.
   A good place to start would be to repeal the bill's
provision for "employer sanctions," which is, we are now
learning, a synonym for harassment. This is the law that
fines employers up to $10,000 and six months in jail for
hiring an "illegal" alien. Last week the General Accounting
Office released a study concluding that the provision had
caused "widespread discrimination" against workers,
especially Hispanics. Rather than play immigrant cop, many
employers avoid the hassle and refuse to hire
Spanish-sounding or -looking Americans. This echoes similar
findings by studies in New York and California.
   In defending the law, Senator Alan Simpson says there may
be discrimination but denies it is "widespread." We'd like to
see him parse that distinction for Hispanics needing a job.
As an arm of Congress, the GAO tends to go easy on the
Members' handiwork, but in this case it couldn't ignore the
facts.
   The GAO surveyed a random sample of 9,491 employers and
estimated that 19% began to discriminate as a result of
Simpson-Mazzoli. About 10% discriminated on the basis of
physical appearance or accent, and another 9% were only
hiring native-born citizens. The GAO extrapolates that
891,000 employers "of the 4.6 million in the population
surveyed reported beginning discriminatory practices because
of the law." Sure sounds "widespread" to us.
   Yet this probably understates any discrimination, since no
one likes to admit to prejudice. Worse, the discrimination
was most pronounced in areas with the largest Hispanic and
Asian populations -- 29% of employers in Los Angeles, for
example. So the law does its worst precisely where racial
comity is most important.
   The law was already notorious for harassing employers. By
last September, the U.S. Immigration Service had assessed $17
million in fines for 3,500 cases of hiring illegals and
36,000 cases of failing to fill out INS paperwork. Alberto
and Estela Fernandez have been fined $18,000 for not filling
out INS forms for their San Antonio maid service. "I feel
like I'm living in a communist country where the government
is constantly looking over my shoulder," Mr. Fernandez told
the Journal's Alfredo Corchado recently.
   Incredibly, in light of this record, Mr. Simpson says he
won't work to repeal the sanctions. Instead, he wants to
impose another layer of watchman government -- specifically,
to "improve our present document system." That means a
national identity card. Mr. Simpson understands the Orwellian
overtones, so he doesn't call it that. But what else to call
a card that would be required before anyone could be hired?
In floating the same idea recently, INS Commissioner Gene
McNary didn't shrink from calling it a national I.D.
   The Social Security card has expressly never been allowed
as an I.D. for civil-liberties reasons. Yet Mr. Simpson wants
to create a new national citizens catalog that bureaucrats
will always find more uses for. Anyone who spoke with an
accent or looked swarthy would be advised to carry this
"passcard" everywhere, just in case the immigrant police
doubted his citizenship. Are we so threatened by Mexican
maids now that we want to tolerate such illiberal means?
   Anyone who visits the 1,990-mile U.S.-Mexican border knows
that blocking illegal immigration is a practical
impossibility. The only real solution is to promote economic
growth in Mexico. One way to do that is to endorse the
Salinas government's brave decision to work toward a
U.S.-Mexican free-trade agreement. Unlike our experiment with
employer sanctions, free trade violates neither human dignity
nor the admirable American spirit of tolerance.

   In my neighborhood, middle- to upperclass Chevy Chase,
Maryland, if we see someone selling drugs in the street,
there is no debate about what to do. We call 911. We do not
convene a seminar on root causes. We expect action, and if we
do not get it, we raise hell. I think that is a natural,
civilized and appropriate reaction. And I don't believe for a
moment that a single parent in southeast Washington should
behave any differently. Equality is the oldest promise of
America. Parents -- all law-abiding citizens -- have an equal
right to expect security regardless of where they live.
   We have been examining the problem of poverty for decades.
Fine. Let it go on. Let it go on smarter. But today the
primary need is not to study residents of poor neighborhoods,
but to help them. How? By doing unto them what we do for
ourselves. I'm asking that we start treating these drug
benighted neighborhoods as if we lived there, not as if they
were some laboratory for social policy.

   GAO Is Unable
   To See Extent
   Of Corn Toxin

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office said it can't
determine the extent of aflatoxin contamination in the U.S.
corn crop. Its conclusion that "information is inadequate"
helps clear the way for a push in Congress to strengthen
screening for the carcinogen.
   The conclusion by Congress's investigative arm wasn't
surprising, since industry officials and academics have said
that the spotty surveys conducted by the Food and Drug
Administration and by some states aren't large enough to be
statistically reliable. Moreover, the tests for aflatoxin
often give conflicting results.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The House Agriculture Committee is widely expected to
debate whether the next five-year farm bill includes a
provision to screen all U.S. corn exports for aflatoxin and
to improve testing procedures.
   In February, the White House signaled that it favored
mandatory screening of corn exports as a way to soothe
importing countries. The voluntary testing of current exports
came under criticism last year from Congress and abroad when
some importing nations detected aflatoxin in U.S. corn and
corn products.
   The House subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains
asked the GAO last year to study how federal regulators
handled a widespread outbreak of aflatoxin in corn during the
1988 drought. Aflatoxin is excreted by a fungus during hot
and dry conditions and is suspected of causing human liver
cancer in regions of Africa and Asia.
   The FDA restricts corn contaminated with tiny amounts of
aflatoxin from moving across state lines. But a February 1989
article in The Wall Street Journal reported that surveillance
is spotty and enforcement rare.
   Between October 1988 and June 1989, according to the GAO,
the FDA found unsafe levels of aflatoxin in 5.5% of the whole
corn it tested as well as in 2.2% of the milled corn it
tested. Food containing more than 20 parts of aflatoxin per
billion is unsafe for human consumption under FDA rules.
   In testimony presented yesterday, John W. Harman, director
of the GAO's food and agriculture issues division, briefed
the subcommittee on the preliminary results of the study,
which is expected to be completed this summer.
   The fact that the GAO can't determine the extent of
aflatoxin contamination weakens the chance that Congress
might try to compensate growers for contaminated corn.
   Corn growers favor compensation as a way to stop farmers
from trying to evade detection by food companies. But it's
impossible to calculate the expense of such a program.

   Tokyo's Market: Was It a Bubble Just Waiting to Burst?

   Was the Japanese stock market a speculative bubble that
finally burst?
   For years, many American and other Western analysts warned
that the highflying Tokyo stock market was headed for a fall.
Despite a seemingly unending string of record peaks, they
said, Tokyo share prices weren't justified by basic stock
analysis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Japanese brokers and investors in turn argued that
Westerners didn't understand the Tokyo market. Standard
fundamental tools used to determine stock prices didn't
matter, they claimed: Measures such as share prices relative
to earnings per share, dividend yields, and the relationship
between share prices and bond yields were all irrelevant.
   Price-earnings ratios in Tokyo soared above 60, compared
with about 13 in New York and 12.5 in Frankfurt, West
Germany. Japanese stocks yielded an average 0.5% a share,
compared with six to seven times that for U.S. stocks.
Investors in Tokyo didn't care. They kept racking up gains as
Japanese stocks continued to soar.
   No more.
   So far this year, the Tokyo stock market is off 28%,
dragged down by the combination of soaring Japanese interest
rates, a sinking yen, rising inflation pressures, and a
general loss of confidence in the same bureaucrats who are
credited with engineering Japan's post-World War II financial
and economic miracle.
   For an American investor, the results are even bleaker.
Add on the yen's 10% fall against the dollar this year, and a
U.S. investor in Japanese shares has watched his portfolio
collapse by a staggering 38%.
   "This is the real thing. It's over," Felix W. Zulauf,
chief investment officer at Clariden Bank in Zurich, said.
"The bubble has burst."
   On Monday, the first trading day of the new fiscal year in
Japan, the Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks plunged 1978.38
points, or 6.6%, to close at 28002.07, the second-biggest
decline ever.
   But despite the debacle in the Tokyo stock market this
year, analysts cited some justification for the big rise in
Japanese shares, only that it got out of hand.
   Barton M. Biggs, a managing director at Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co., points to Japan's strong economic growth and corporate
profits, low inflation and declining interest rates -- once
as low as 3%. "When you have that combination, plus a strong
currency, your stock market should sell at a very high
valuation level," he said.
   "The Tokyo market sold at 50 times earnings. I can make a
case that maybe it should have," Mr. Biggs said. "But when it
got to 60 times, it got beyond where it should have."
   David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago, said Japanese share prices were
propelled until recently by the convergence of three powerful
forces: a world-wide slump in commodity prices in the 1980s,
an expansionist Japanese monetary policy designed to support
the weak dollar from late 1986 through the end of 1988, and
the unusual nature of the Japanese stock market, where many
companies own one another's stock.
   The commodity-price slump helped fuel a huge Japanese
trade surplus. Japan's easy-money policy meant lower interest
rates and helped create a huge pool of Japanese funds that
had to be invested somewhere. At the same time,
cross-shareholdings among Japanese corporations limited the
number of shares outstanding that were available to be bought
and sold.
   If there was a speculative bubble, most analysts put its
beginnings last fall, when Tokyo share prices started racing
higher, driven by a crescendo of investor demand. At the
time, big institutional investors cited the prospects of
strong economic growth in Japan, high recurring corporate
profits, and a flood of new money coming into the Tokyo
market from pension funds and government-bond redemptions.
   On the back of these fundamentals, the Tokyo stock market
soared, establishing 13 records and rising 4.8% in December,
and closing the year at a record 38915.87.
   But some analysts see real evidence of frenzied
speculation in Tokyo that went far beyond what economic
fundamentals would justify. "Certainly there was a bubble,"
said Akira Suzuki, an executive director at Morgan Stanley in
Tokyo. He ascribed the Tokyo stock market's strong run-up
since 1985 to heavy flows of money into Japanese stocks, not
to fundamentals. Specifically, he noted that tokkin funds,
which are used by Japanese corporations to invest spare cash
and pension money, grew from their start in 1985 to 50
trillion yen ($316.1 billion), and that nearly all of this
money was plowed into the stock market. "There were no
criteria to justify the investment," he said; rather, the
money was just looking for a home.
   Another pivotal support of the Japanese stock market
during its heyday was land prices. The property market in
Japan has zoomed in recent years, with prices in Tokyo
doubling since 1986. Encouraged by these increases, Japanese
banks lent money against property. The money often ended up
in the stock market. And money made in the stock market was
used to buy property. Thus, Morgan Stanley's Mr. Suzuki and
others argue, a speculative bubble developed. "It was
self-created," he said.
   For a while, many Western analysts have been almost
gleeful in watching the decline of the Tokyo stock market
that began early this year. Many believed the Japanese were
getting their just desserts. But, "It's no longer funny,"
George L. Noble, an international portfolio manager at
Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co. in Boston, said. "I'm
worried. I don't know how they are going to get out of this."
   This pessimism has spread to Tokyo. At the beginning of
last year, Japan's giant Nomura Securities Co. and other
firms "traveled around the world, projecting 43000 on the
Nikkei for 1990," Clariden Bank's Mr. Zulauf said. "Now, the
same people are sending faxes forecasting 24000."
   Already, foreign brokers are moving to capitalize on the
new mood. Richard Greer, managing director of Baring
Securities Ltd. in Tokyo, is adding staff in his research
department. He figures to sell more stock to Japanese
investors newly and finally interested in investing along
fundamental lines.
   Some Japanese investors, apparently, have stopped making
big bets based mostly on prospective earnings and companies'
assets -- primarily land and stockholdings in other companies
-- the way they often did in the past. "We are now in a
market that is looking for earnings results, not earnings
prospects," Bruce D. Johnson, a Baring director, said.
   So far, the plunge in Tokyo stocks hasn't spread to major
stock markets outside Japan, at least not in a big way.
Traders attribute yesterday's lackluster performance on the
New York Stock Exchange to worries about whether Japanese
institutions might begin unloading American stocks to cover
losses in Tokyo.
   But to date, the U.S. market seems to attribute Tokyo's
problems to "indigenous Japanese factors," said Laszlo
Birinyi of Birinyi Associates Inc., a New York-based
financial consulting firm. Analysts added that the
combination of a strong dollar and an unexpectedly resilient
U.S. economy are keeping both foreign and U.S. investors in
American stocks.
   Moreover, Mr. Birinyi said: "Historically, the
relationships between markets isn't nearly as strong as a lot
of people thought it was. A lot of the appeal of the coupling
theory occurred when all the markets were going up. But over
time, the relationship between world markets isn't as strong
as many people have felt."
   Mr. Birinyi pointed out that yesterday, when the Dow Jones
Industrial Average declined 6.76 points, was the third Monday
of the past six that the U.S. market essentially shook off
big drops in Tokyo. Others were Feb. 26, when Dow rose 38.29
points after the Nikkei fell 1569.1 points, and March 19,
when the Dow rose 14.41, compared with a 1353.2 fall in the
Nikkei.
   The differing results are "certainly not what one would
have thought a year ago," he said.
   Even though many Western analysts have finally been proven
correct on the Tokyo market, "You would have lost 15 fortunes
before you were right," Mr. Birinyi conceded. "You would have
been financially dead if you had shorted Japan the first time
price-earnings ratios rose above 30."
   Now many analysts see the Tokyo market stabilizing near
its current levels, maybe for a month or two, before resuming
its downward spiral.
   Anthony E. Gibbons, a futures trader at the U.S. unit of
Daiwa Securities Co. in New York, said Japanese shares could
even experience a bear-market rally, with the Nikkei shooting
back up to the low 30000 range before falling again.
   But beyond that, pessimism reigns. "Once a bubble bursts,
you don't go to normal {stock} valuation levels, but instead
overshoot," Mr. Zulauf of Clariden Bank said. He projects the
Tokyo market will tumble to the low 20000 level on the Nikkei
"later this year or early in 1991."
   He said that Japanese inflation is at the highest it has
been in eight years, and that interest rates will rise more,
because Japan's central bank will have little choice but to
tighten monetary policy.
   Mr. Biggs of Morgan Stanley said the Nikkei index could
fall to as low as 17000 or 18000. "It wouldn't be in the
least bit unprecedented for a market to drop 40% to 50% after
a 25-year bull run, which is what the Japanese market has
had," he said. He noted that indexes of the U.S. stock market
fell that much in 1973-74, some even more.
   "The legend of a bullet-proof Japan, efficient and
invincible, is dissipating," Mr. Biggs told clients last
week. "Meanwhile, Japan Inc., probably the greatest cartel of
the post-war world, is falling apart amidst the squabbling"
between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan about
whether to raise interest rates to defend the sagging yen.
   Mr. Biggs was one of those who predicted that the Tokyo
market would fall. "But two years early," he conceded. "It's
hard to differentiate between being early and wrong."

   Film Satirizing Ad Industry
   Plays to a Touchy Audience

   How's this for an eye-catching new ad campaign for United
Airlines? "Most of our passengers get there alive."
   How about a meaner, tougher AT&amp;T? "We're tired of taking
your crap. If we fold, you'll have no damn phones."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These and other catchy "ads" -- some too outrageous to be
repeated in this newspaper -- can be seen in "Crazy People,"
a new film that spoofs the advertising business. The satire
is so biting, in fact, that it is already stirring up
controversy. ABC and CBS have declined to run some
commercials for the film, worried they might give free
exposure to products and at the same time offend some of the
networks' biggest advertisers. United Airlines, for example,
has already made it clear that it isn't amused.
   In the Paramount Pictures release, which makes its debut
next week, Dudley Moore plays an ad agency executive who
declares he's sick of lying all the time. He decides to try
"truth in advertising" and comes up with a half-dozen wacky
ad campaigns that inspire his associates to commit him to a
sanitarium. But the ads are mistakenly printed in newspapers,
magazines and posters on the sides of buses -- and are hugely
successful. Suddenly, Mr. Moore is the hottest thing on
Madison Avenue.
   While advertisers typically pay big bucks to get their
products placed in Hollywood films, Paramount is giving a
dozen or so the dubious honor of getting their products
spoofed for free. While there are ads for fictitious brands,
the writers decided the best way to get laughs would be to
use the real thing: products such as Porsche and Jaguar, John
Hancock life insurance and Metamucil.
   The unit of Paramount Communications Inc. didn't ask any
of the advertisers for permission to take their names in
vain. But the company says it doesn't have any legal concerns
because it believes the movie is protected as parody. "The
comedy parodies many companies and their products, including
our own," says Barry London, one of two motion picture group
presidents at the studio. "It's all in the spirit of great
fun."
   "Crazy People" does poke fun at movie ads with a campaign
for a fictitious Paramount movie called "The Freak." The fake
ad promises not only to scare people but to mess them up for
life.
   But while the movie takes on some big corporate guns,
Paramount did decide there were some it didn't want to tangle
with. An ad about the pleasures of smoking, for example,
features a made-up brand, Amalfi cigarettes, with the copy:
"Cancer? Perhaps. Flavor? For Sure]" Says writer Mitch
Markowitz: "Cigarette companies are very litigious, and the
studio didn't want to upset any of them."
   Responses to "Crazy People" vary. A spokeswoman for ad
agency Fallon McElligott, which handles Porsche, says, "I
guess our only response for now is that it's in sort of bad
taste." The ad for Jaguar draws a startled laugh from Peter
Geer of the auto maker's agency Geer DuBois. Mr. Geer says
he'd rather stay out of this one. The satirical ads for
Porsche and Jaguar feature ad copy -- unprintable here --
promising immediate sexual gratification to men who buy the
cars.
   At UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit, a spokesman says the
company doesn't think the reference is funny and has asked if
it can preview the movie before its opening. Paramount
marketing chief Arthur Cohen says they can pay $7 in a movie
theater just like everyone else.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. distanced itself from the movie's
Metamucil ad, which goes right to the gut: "It will help you
go to the toilet. . . . If you don't use it you'll get cancer
and die." A spokeswoman says the ad claims in "Crazy People"
for Metamucil and other products are "outlandish, and we
think consumers will recognize this." She adds, however, that
the company "would be concerned if consumers take these
claims seriously."
   A spokesman for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is more
magnanimous. "Large companies have to carry a sense of humor
with them at times," he says. "If I had to sum up our
reaction, I'd say we're not amused, but we're not offended
either." He adds that "AT&amp;T has suspected from time to time
that a few of our copywriters have frequented insane
asylums."
   Some of the TV networks clearly aren't amused. While
Paramount and its ad agency, WPP Group PLC's Ogilvy &amp; Mather
unit, have gotten commercials for "Crazy People" cleared by
NBC and the Fox network, ABC and CBS have declined to run
some.
   Matthew Margo, vice president of program practices at CBS,
says the network asked for revisions that included dropping
all the brand names. CBS was concerned, Mr. Margo says, about
"the prolific exposure of various brands which we think is
gratuitous and inappropriate." Moreover, he adds, "in a
couple of instances, the clients of this network are
portrayed in a way that might be troubling to them."
   Harvey Dzodin, ABC's vice president for commercial
clearances, also asked for revised ads that avoided brand
names or used some of the fictitious ones in the movie. "We
generally try not to have secondary mentions of products in
advertising for other products," says Mr. Dzodin. Equally
important, he says, "we'd be crazy people to allow false
disparagements of advertisers that are some of the major
corporations in this country."
   Paramount's marketing chief, Mr. Cohen, says the studio
has decided not to bother running any ads on CBS, but has
agreed to cut some brand names out of commercials at ABC's
request. For instance, the studio cut the John Hancock name
out of a clip featuring an ad for life insurance with the
copy, "We know you love him, but if he happens to die we'll
give you two Mercedes and a summer home, too. "

   Arby's Kinder Campaign
                                                                                                       

   Arby's Inc. is shelving its burger-bashing ad strategy in
favor of a kinder campaign spotlighting its own product line.
   Arby's new campaign, which begins airing this week and
will run throughout most of the year, features jingles that
pitch the chain's roast beef and other sandwiches. The ads
were developed by W.B. Doner &amp; Co., Baltimore.
   The new ads are strikingly different from past ads that
poked fun at hamburger chains, Arby's big rivals. One ad last
year, for example, showed a washed-up clown lamenting his
distaste for burgers while talking on the phone with his
agent. The clown looked a bit like Ronald McDonald.
   Frank Belatti, Arby's new president and chief operating
officer, says past ads didn't focus on Arby's food in part
because there weren't a lot of products to boast about. But
now Arby's has an expanded menu, he says. "We have a product
line that deserves to be romanced a bit."
   Mr. Belatti said Arby's will spend about $48 million on
advertising this year, up sharply from last year's
expenditure of $35 million. The increased ad budget largely
results from the continued national expansion of the Arby's
franchise.

   MEXICO ACCOUNT: The Mexican Government Office of Tourism
yesterday named Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, a unit of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., to handle its estimated $15 million
account. The decision to keep the account at Saatchi, which
has handled the business for many years, followed numerous
reviews of many ad agencies. After a review that ended in
December, Bozell was tapped to handle the account. But new
top executives were then hired at the tourist office. Those
executives surprised the agencies involved by launching
another review. In a memo to employees yesterday, Bozell

   RICHMOND, Va. -- Heritage Financial Corp. said it intends
to boost the tangible capital of its Heritage Savings Bank
unit by exchanging an $8.4 million subordinated note issued
by the bank in 1987 for common stock. The parent company also
suspended its preferred stock dividend indefinitely to
conserve the bank's capital.
   The proposed swap, which requires regulatory and corporate
approvals, would increase the bank's tangible capital by $8.4
million to a total of $2 million. The transaction would still
leave Heritage Savings $10 million short of new federal
requirements for tangible capital.

   In your March 8 page-one article "Fertility Rights," I
sympathize with Eloisa Silva. Here she is, a single mother of
three, trying to work, maintain and survive. Barely above the
poverty level, she stretches every cent of her earnings in
order for her children to eat a fairly well-balanced meal and
wear decent clothes. Birth control is a prime choice for her.
   Why shouldn't there be facilities for low-income families
to receive qualitative and affordable health care? And yes,
any type of birth control or family planning available?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The theory that family-planning centers promote
promiscuity is ludicrous.
   Iris V. Kennon

   Ms. Silva is portrayed as being a "pawn" in the "war over
abortion rights" because her birth-control pills are no
longer provided free by a state-subsidized planning center.
She now has to buy the pills, and if the situation continues,
"I won't be able to make soup for my kids."
   This attitude has me livid. What is more important, her
hormones or her children? What about her sexual partner(s)
and his responsibility in the situation? Our society is so
hung up on "rights" that we all too often neglect
"responsibilities."
   I believe in helping others, but I do not believe in
carrying them, swaddling them in cotton to insulate them from
reality and responsibility. This merely cripples them,
causing any latent sense of responsibility to atrophy rather
than develop and become stronger. I feel sorry for Ms.
Silva's children, but I have no patience with their mother.

   It's Oh] so easy and Oh] so cowardly to force others to
follow your beliefs when you don't have to pay the price.
Make the anti-abortionist anti-family-planning-center people
pay in hard cash for the costs of raising these unwanted
children, including the costs of any crime-related activities
they get into because they were unloved and grew up in
deprived circumstances. Make them donate time to raising
these unwanted children they are trying to force other women
to have. Do their religious convictions go that deep? If it's
wrong to abort a fetus, it's even more wrong to make an
innocent child grow up unwanted and in squalid poverty.

   Whenever I hear the words "rights" and "refunding" in the
same sentence, I check to see if my wallet is still in my
pocket. Why do Ms. Silva and her boyfriend have a right to
taxpayer-underwritten fun time? In the real free market, the
users bear the costs of a good or service.
   You throw in a couple of smoke screens: These people are
poor; the government-funded clinics do other things, too. And
one threat: If you don't cough up for the condoms, we'll make
you pay for the welfare babies.
   David Shoup

   Hallelujah for California and Gov. George Deukmejian for
cutting the family-planning budget greatly. None of us can
demand financial or supportive help in anything if we refuse
to obey certain standards, laws, ethics or at the very least
self-control.
   I for one do not want to encourage or give to the Silvas
of this country as they seek to drain funds and show a poor
example to the next generation by demanding we pay for their
play.

   Thanks for describing how anti-abortion organizations
forced the closing of family-planning clinics in California
and are close to doing so in several other states. For many
years, pro-choice and family-planning advocates have tried to
make the public aware that a significant faction of the
anti-choice community seeks to eliminate not only the right
to choose abortion but the right to use contraception as
well. The response has been that pro-choice groups were
engaging in hyperbole to further their own cause, or that
they were foolish to believe that opponents of contraception
could be influential in modern America. Now perhaps those who
have dismissed the anti-contraception forces as unimportant
fringe extremists will wake up to the damage these people can
do.

   Wouldn't it be wonderful if each anti-abortionist adopted
an unwanted child -- not the perfect, healthy little ones,
but the drug and AIDS victims, the abused and neglected and
unloved? There seem to be plenty of them these days.
   Then those folks could give these threatened children the
advantages of a loving family life they might never have
otherwise.

   Travel:
   Cruise Operators Hope Marketing Push
   Will Put the Wind Back in Their Sales

   After a decade of clear sailing, the North American cruise
industry is entering some rough waters.
   Saddled with too many boats and too few bookings,
cruise-line operators in Florida and travel agents across the
country are scrambling for passengers. The lines have slashed
fares as much as 60%, and they're rushing out new products,
such as on-board fitness programs and "theme cruises." Even
advertising budgets, to which many small operators have
traditionally paid scant attention, are being beefed up to
spread the word that a cruise -- at least in the industry's
eyes -- is still a bargain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pyrotechnics, however, can't mask what's been a tough
season for the boat business. "It's been a bloodbath," says
Donald Nagel, president of Wide World of Cruises Inc., a
travel agency in Coral Springs, Fla. Larry Fishkin, whose
Miami-based travel agency specializes in cruises, adds: "It's
not unusual to save someone $800 to $1,000 on a seven-day
cruise, and I don't see things getting any better."
   Doubts about the future are something new for the
industry. But by most accounts, the cruise business has
simply become a victim of its own success. In the 1980s, such
innovations as three-day and four-day cruises and "cruises to
nowhere" helped spur passenger growth of about 11% a year.
Over the past four years, Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines
Inc., the industry leader, saw its revenue almost triple and
its earnings almost double.
   Those kinds of numbers have drawn more players into the
pool. Club Mediterranee Inc., for instance, whose popular,
all-inclusive vacation formula has been mimicked by the
cruise industry, recently launched its first ship, the
425-passenger Club Med 1, for seven-night cruises. This year
alone, 15 new ships with 12,000 berths -- a 16% increase from
1989 -- are expected to enter the North American market,
which includes Alaska, Canada, the Caribbean and Mexico.
   All these boats, however, are plowing into consumer
concerns about a sluggish economy. Many vacationers,
according to travel agents, appear increasingly reluctant to
part with a few thousand bucks -- paid in advance -- to
paddle around the Caribbean for a few days.
   But the steep discounts are helping to put passengers on
board. And shorter cruises, though subject to discounting,
haven't been hurt as much as longer cruises. The industry
also is quick to note that it's still only scratching the
surface of the vacation market: Each year, only 5% of the
some 70 million Americans on vacation who can afford to take
a cruise do so.
   "That huge potential for cruising explains why so many
ships are being built," says Jay J. Lewis, president of
MarketScope Inc., a cruise consulting firm in Miami. "The
problem is that little or nothing has been done to spur
demand along with it."
   Indeed, the industry's own surveys show that, even in the
best of times, the main reason most consumers have never
taken a cruise is the pricey image. The upfront cost of a
seven-day Caribbean cruise can easily run $1,600 per person
(including air fare).
   "People see the price and say, `I don't want to spend that
much on a vacation,'" says Mitchell J. Schlesinger, senior
vice president of marketing for Costa Cruises Inc., Miami, a
unit of Italy's Costa Crociere S.p.A. But if people were to
total what they spend on other types of vacations, he says,
they would find that their costs approximate that of a
cruise.
   Outwardly, cruise executives preach patience in educating
prospective passengers about the value of a cruise. In
reality, patience has gone out the porthole this season in
the weekly scramble to fill berths. Getting people up the
gangplank means more than just the price of a ticket: Each
passenger also spends an average of $50 a day on gifts,
drinks and gambling -- most of it on board.
   Thus, discounting -- lots of it -- has fast become the
norm in an industry where executives grimace at the word. The
industry has always done some discounting, but this winter,
newspapers and magazines across the country have carried ads
with headlines such as "Reduced for Quick Sail," "2nd Person
Cruises Free," and "Life Saving Rates."
   Small and large operators alike have been forced to cut
prices. Miami-based Dolphin Cruise, with two ships, this year
eliminated the top fares it normally can charge at the height
of the winter season. Carnival, meanwhile, is offering for as
little as $599 seven-day cruises that regularly start at
$1,175 (without air fare).
   The fare cuts, while serving the immediate purpose of
getting some passengers -- any passengers -- on board, may
come back to haunt the cruise business, some analysts say.
They cite the example of rebates in the auto industry. "The
American consumer loves a deal," says Mr. Lewis at
MarketScope. "With big discounts, the cruise industry is
training consumers that the price isn't going to go up, it
can only go down."
   Ship operators acknowledge the damage they might be doing.
With the cruise industry accounting for only 5% of the
nation's $100 billion-a-year leisure business, "It's foolish
to be trying to steal what little market share there is from
one another," says Mickey Arison, president of Carnival. "If
{discounting} continues, it will eventually hurt us."
   The industry hopes to wean itself from discounting by
spreading the word that cruising is reasonably priced and
"more relaxing" than a comparable land-based vacation. "We've
yet to do a good enough job of raising awareness of
cruising's value," says Costa's Mr. Schlesinger. To get the
word out, he says, the industry will boost ad spending 20%
this year to $300 million.
   Television promises to get a big piece of the pie as the
ubiquitous Carnival is joined by other big lines. Royal
Caribbean Cruises Ltd., for instance, has weighed in with its
sultry "Royal Caribbean Vacation" spots -- which don't even
mention the word "cruise." The company says it wants to
position itself as a "vacation" option, not a "cruise"
option, emphasize the range of available activities, stand
out in the crowded cruise market and compete with other types
of vacations options. Commercials for Princess Cruises Inc.,
a unit of Britain's Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation
Co., feature actor Gavin MacLeod, whose stint as the captain
on the popular "Love Boat" TV series is credited with
boosting cruising's popularity.
   Cruise lines are hoping new programs and itineraries will
not only attract new passengers but also bring repeat
business by offering previous customers a new experience. For
example, many operators now offer fitness programs --
complete with low-calorie meals. And to compete with the
likes of Walt Disney World during the peak summer season, all
the major lines are pushing programs for couples traveling
with children.
   "Theme cruises," another growing trend, are being designed
around everything from rock 'n' roll to chocolate. Royal
Caribbean, which sponsors a tournament on the senior
professional golf tour and bills itself as "the official
cruise line of the PGA," offers a seven-day cruise in which
passengers debark to play golf in several different ports.

   COLUMBUS JUNCTION, Iowa -- The business of IBP is
business. It carves up meat, it carves out profits. Its
corporate values are not necessarily small-town values.
   Columbus Junction knows that now if it didn't before.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This heartland town in southeast Iowa has learned a great
deal since August 1985, when IBP Inc., a subsidiary of
Occidental Petroleum Corp., began a major expansion of a
closed-down Rath Packing Co. plant here. Columbus Junction
has learned that giant corporations can treat workers, and
towns, like interchangeable parts.
   "You either do this {welcome new industry} or you die,"
says Maryella Davis, a Main Street dry-goods employee. She
could be speaking for every town desperate for jobs in the
rural Midwest. IBP brought 1,300 jobs, almost one for every
man, woman and child in this town of 1,400. But there is a
trade-off.
   IBP, with a 1989 payroll of $23 million, has saved
Columbus Junction economically -- at the cost of rending
Columbus Junction socially. The intangibles that defined the
heartland town -- stability and continuity -- have begun to
die.
   Since IBP came to town, crime is up 400%, says Police
Chief David Orr. Junior-high and high-school pupil turnover
hit 25% last semester alone, says Principal John Della
Vedova. The police chief suspects there may be 20 or 30
outriders of big-city gangs on Main Street. The plant has
become the tail that wags the dog.
   City Councilman Larry K. Robertson concedes he didn't
anticipate the impact 1,300 people would have: "I just did
not realize how big a monster {the plant} is."
   All this is rooted in IBP's recruiting practices. Not
enough Iowans have been lining up for those 1,300 jobs. And
so IBP recruits, continually and methodically, in the
nation's most desperate pockets of unemployment. From
Brownsville, Texas, (Mexicans and Hispanic-Americans) to
Chicago (inner-city blacks) to Michigan (laid-off auto
workers), wave after wave of IBP new-hires keeps rolling in.
   "These people," towns-folk unconsciously refer to them.
   "Nobody has as good an entry program for people who are
down-and-out," says Eugene D. Leman, IBP's executive vice
president for pork. And undoubtedly, many people would say
that IBP, in giving the jobless jobs and in some cases moving
them out of impoverished central cities, is performing a
laudable public service.
   But the work is hard, and few plants lose so many workers
so quickly. Last year alone, net turnover here approached
100%, according to Mr. Leman. The 3 1/2-year-old plant can
count about 700 workers who have stayed at least a year. The
remaining 600 slots turned over at least twice last year;
most of the newcomers left town. The company predicts
turnover will drop sharply as the plant matures.
   Blue-collar wages at the nonunion plant currently start at
$6 an hour and top out at $10. Despite pay rates that seem
relatively low, the workers last December voted nearly 4 to 1
against joining the Teamsters union. The union lost partly
because company supervisors managed to convince Hispanic
workers that a pro-union vote would mean "no renewal of work
permits" for illegal-alien workers, contends Robert Schorg,
secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 238. IBP spokesman
Gary Mickelson calls that allegation "absurd" and interprets
the election as "an overwhelming vote of confidence in the
company."
   In any event, "it's hard for anybody with a family to make
a living at IBP, which is a pretty sad commentary," says the
Rev. Stephen Ebel, a Catholic priest.
   The town literally clothes some IBP workers. "We get
people who arrive with only the clothes on their backs," says
Marcy Gerst, an outreach worker for Southeast Iowa Community
Action. Her agency gives them secondhand clothing.
   The town ministerial alliance donates gasoline money.
"When they get here, they have nothing," says the Rev. Thomas
Woodin, the pastor of the United Methodist Churches. The
poorest have no cars. It isn't uncommon to see IBP workers
walking along the highway to and from work.
   The town grapples with social upheaval. Columbus Junction
has long had a Hispanic minority, but the new arrivals bring
new problems. Some schoolchildren can scarcely communicate
without the help of local Hispanics who translate for them.
News stories now run in both English and Spanish in the
Columbus Gazette; a few local residents protested this,
according to News Editor Criss Wilson.
   This town has long since lost the virginal innocence its
late-1830s settlers encountered: a land "smiling in all the
freshness of primeval beauty," one rhapsodized. But with its
church steeples and its 108-year-old library standing high
above the Iowa River, it still hints of an earlier, simpler
Iowa idealized in Grant Wood paintings.
   Into this setting moved the world's largest producer of
fresh pork and beef. Last year, IBP bought $356 million worth
of hogs for the plant, plus $4 million in other area
purchases. It is proud of its safety record and its
state-of-the-art equipment. It also is combative and
controversial.
   Highly efficient and aggressively anti-union, IBP is
driving older Iowa packing plants over the edge. Anti-IBP
activists in Manchester, Iowa, fought off a proposed IBP
packing plant that would have deposited treated waste water
into a residential lake. Last year, IBP Chairman Robert L.
Peterson, in a biting letter to Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad,
suggested that "a lot of Iowans just simply feel that big
business is bad" -- even though IBP had received at least
$7.8 million in state and federal aid since 1983.
   In Columbus Junction, IBP responded to the growing social
pressures, in a way that can only be described as measured.
   Ms. Gerst, the social worker, says she asked the company
to contribute to 1986 Christmas baskets her agency was
distributing to the poor. "Their representatives told me --
how shall I put it? -- they weren't in the business of
charity," she says.
   She tried again in 1987, failed, and didn't try at all in
1988. But in 1989, IBP came through with $500, fresh pork and
Christmas turkeys. Mr. Mickelson, the spokesman, points to
newspaper clippings showing a variety of IBP donations,
including $1,000 to the United Fund and $1,500 to the
Columbus Community Center. Mr. Woodin says the ministerial
alliance has neither requested nor received IBP help.
   In a recent public-relations gesture, IBP flew town
leaders to its Dakota City, Neb., headquarters. There, Police
Chief Orr asked the company to screen new hires more
intensively. It demurred.
   "We ask people to be honest on their resume. Our
interviewers do an interview. We do a physical, and we test
for drugs. I think that should be sufficient," says Executive
Vice President Leman.
   To town leaders such as Thomas Huston, the president of
the Columbus Junction State Bank and the man who led the
effort to bring in IBP, the net benefits far outweigh the
costs. "People forget where we were," he says. "Columbus
Junction was going backward. Now, our supermarket expands.
Our storefronts haven't closed. All of a sudden we get a new
tavern, get a new diner, get a new road." School enrollment
is up, too.
   Meanwhile, the town is working hard to apply its
traditional values to a changed environment. There have been
few serious racial incidents. And the high school,
particularly, has witnessed those little acts of humanity
that show the town at its best.
   Opening day last fall found Armid Benitez, who came here
from Mexico with her mother, sobbing in the parking lot.
"I've never seen a 15-year-old sob so hard," recalls Becky
Furlong, an elementary-school administrative assistant. "She
just did not want to go into that high school." But local
kids put their arms around her and, comforting her, coaxed
her into the frightening new place.
   Overhanging the town is the problem of affordable housing.
Columbus Junction figures it is about 200 units short, and
IBP workers have overflowed into nearby towns. One locally
owned rooming house" -- the barracks," some townspeople call
it -- typically houses dozens of persons. It has only two
bathrooms. "Just the other day, I had a guy come in here and
ask about putting up a tent along the river," says Councilman
Robertson, who indicated he could do so. "I told him there
will probably be more down there in the summer."
   "If workers do decide to do that, it's by choice,"
responds Mr. Mickelson of IBP. "We do our best to find
housing for people. We do put them up at the local motel
until they become established."
   Additional low-cost housing won't be built, city leaders
fear, unless IBP helps out. "Developers ask, `What industry
do you have?' We say, `IBP.' They ask, `What else do you
have?' We say, `IBP,'" City Attorney Jay Schweitzer joked
recently.
   The company, which says it lost some $250,000 last year
renting out mobile homes, seemed ready to take the lead as
late as last summer. Then, it got annoyed by complaints and
negative press. "Immediately, the naysayers came out of the
woods {saying}, `We don't want these people here,'" Mr. Leman
says. "We just decided we're not interested in fighting until
public opinion is more solidified." As John E. Allis, the
plant manager, puts it: "If you kick a dog every day, he
shies away."
   The plant itself, a marvel of efficiency, looks like a
cross between a hospital trauma room and an auto assembly
plant. Slaughtering 11,500 hogs a day, up to six days a week,
it runs on a caste system visible only to the workers
themselves. Kill Floor workers such as "the sticker," who
stands ankle-deep in congealing blood as he stabs open
jugular veins, consider themselves superior -- tougher-than
workers on the Cut Floor, where carcasses are cut apart.
   At the bottom, perhaps, is the rendering crew. They render
down the 40,000 pounds of sour-smelling offal produced by the
plant every hour. When "rendos" walk into Becky's, a local
tavern, everyone slides down to the end of the bar. The
bartender breaks out the scented candles.
   Meatpacking is inherently hard work. Diane Christ, a
former IBP supervisor, says she quit after a series of
battles to make it easier for pregnant women. "I don't
believe women in their first trimester should be lifting
45-pound boxes," she says. "I had a girlfriend on the floor
who had a miscarriage." Mr. Mickelson says IBP will "honor
any restrictions placed on the employee by her physician. And
we welcome that information."
   Despite such complaints, many workers are fiercely loyal
to IBP. "They've been damn good to me," says Paco Orum, a Cut
Floor worker. "They give me overtime. They give me the
opportunity to bust my hump."
   At 42, with his graying mustache and ever-present bandanna
atop his head, Mr. Orum has become a legend, with a
reputation for hard work and for standing by his friends. On
a recent night, the only white worker in the town's new He
Ain't Here Lounge, he drank beer with some of them. He
reflected on the forces and the company that had drawn
workers to this little town from throughout the U.S. and
Mexico.
   Half-jokingly, yet half-solemnly, he said: "We've got a
white guy here by the name of Paco. We've got a black guy by
the name of Kelly. We've got another black by the name of
Shawn. This is Columbus Junction] This is the American
dream."

   Stratus Computer Inc. introduced a new line of
fault-tolerant computers, replacing its three-year-old
products and expanding into the high-powered mainframe arena
for the first time.
   Analysts said the new products should help Stratus, which
is based in Marlboro, Mass., resume its rapid growth next
year. The company has faced a slowdown in recent quarters as
customers waited for new products.

   "This announcement will help it regain its momentum in the
market," said Neil Weintraut, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp;
Quist Inc. Last year, Stratus's net income rose 21% to $35.4
million, or $1.71 a share, on revenue of $341.3 million. Mr.
Weintraut estimated that per-share profit only will rise to
$1.80 this year, but will jump to $2.25 in 1991.
   Stratus's fault-tolerant computers, which are designed to
keep working even if parts fail, are used for on-line
transaction processing. Such applications include bank-teller
networks, stock-trading systems and airline reservations.
   Stratus has been a distant No. 2 in the fault-tolerant
market to Tandem Computers Inc. But lately the business has
gotten more crowded with Digital Equipment Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. entering.
   International Business Machines Corp., the leader in
transaction processing, doesn't make its own fault-tolerant
computer. IBM resells those made by Stratus and accounted for
about 30% of Stratus's sales in past years. Yesterday IBM
said it will resell Stratus's new systems as an added part of
its System 88 family.
   Stratus unveiled 13 new systems in its announcement at
prices ranging from $94,000 to $9 million. It also will
continue to sell a $37,000 system introduced last fall.
Stratus's new midrange systems, the 200 series, about double
the performance of their 100 series predecessors and cost
about the same amount, from $225,000 to $1.1 million. They
will be available in May. The new mainframe computers, also
available in May, cost as much as $9.4 million.
   William Foster, president of Stratus, said Stratus doesn't
expect to sell any of the mainframe systems right away. Carol
Muratore, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. said the
mainframe systems mean that Stratus's "high-end customers
don't go elsewhere" if they need bigger fault tolerant
computers in the future.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Stratus closed at $21.625, down 50 cents.

   MILAN, Italy -- Carlo De Benedetti and Silvio Berlusconi
led Italy's charge into Europe well before 1992 was declared
the year for economic unity in Western Europe. And they got a
head start on others in Eastern Europe when Communism began
to collapse there.
   Mr. De Benedetti, chairman of computer-maker Ing. C.
Olivetti &amp; Co. S.p.A., turned around an ailing typewriter
company in West Germany. He has invested in Spain, Portugal,
Greece and Hungary. Two years ago he tried to form the first
pan-European holding company through a hostile takeover of
Societe Generale de Belgique, which owns more than 1,200
companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Berlusconi was just as active. He added television
stations in France and Spain to his three private Italian
networks. He obtained the rights to sell television
advertising in the Soviet Union, began making TV movies, and
turned up wherever a new commercial TV venture was launched.
   But late last year, Italy's European standard bearers got
into a brawl that is tying them down at home and distracting
their efforts to expand abroad. The battle, over Italian
publisher Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., drags the two
entrepreneurs from boardroom to courtroom to shareholders'
meetings in Milan and Rome. Meanwhile, German, French and
British executives are scurrying from Madrid to Moscow
signing joint venture deals that might well have whetted the
appetites of the Italian tycoons.
   "A few years ago Italian companies led the wave of
investments in Europe," says Romano Prodi, former chairman of
state holding company IRI. "But that was short-lived, and now
we're back to the internal fighting" of the Middle Ages.
   "We have no government," adds Mr. Prodi, "just strong
individualistic entrepreneurs sending their foot soldiers
against each other and killing each other off in their
strange wars."
   Indeed, the intrigues and infighting among Italy's tiny
corporate elite -- Signori De Benedetti and Berlusconi along
with Giovanni Agnelli of Fiat S.p.A. and Raul Gardini of
agribusiness giant Ferruzzi Group -- command banner headlines
in the rival newspapers they own, and dominate Milanese
cocktail-party gossip. The battles are local, bitter,
intense, and perplexing to foreigners, as well as to many
Italians.
   Among the most difficult to fathom is the continuing
struggle over Mondadori. Mr. De Benedetti first invested in
the ailing publisher in 1984 and took effective financial
control three years later after the death of then-chairman
Mario Formenton. Under De Benedetti guidance, Mondadori's
profits tripled and its market capitalization soared from $80
million to about $2 billion.
   The Formenton family signed a contract agreeing to turn
over their 25% holding to Mr. De Benedetti for 200 billion
lire ($167 million), by the end of January 1991. But last
December, Mario Formenton's son, Luca, and other relatives
decided instead to sell their shares at a higher, undisclosed
price to Mr. Berlusconi, who had been buying Mondadori shares
on the open market. This gave him a majority of the common
shares.
   Despite howls and lawsuits from the De Benedetti camp, Mr.
Berlusconi was elected chairman of Mondadori at a January
meeting of holders of common stock, and took over day-to-day
operations of the company. But Mr. De Benedetti controls 80%
of the Mondadori preferred stock, with the power to decide on
capital increases for the company. And he can use this power
to block Mr. Berlusconi's ambitions or paralyze the company.
   Both sides insist there are higher issues than money in
the struggle. De Benedetti aides claim that press freedoms
are at stake. Mondadori's crown jewels are the daily La
Repubblica and newsweeklies L'Espresso and Panorama. If Mr.
Berlusconi succeeds in taking over these publications, he
will achieve near-monopoly control over Italian media, warns
Corrado Passera, the executive leading Mr. De Benedetti's
fight for Mondadori. The media element "makes this more than
just a battle between two guys," insists Mr. Passera. "There
is . . . an attempt to silence a strong critical voice in
Italy."
   Nonsense, say the Berlusconi people: Their boss, the TV
mogul, wants above all to ensure that Italy becomes a major
media player on the continent at a time when the European
Community is moving toward a more unified market and walls
are tumbling in Eastern Europe. "You've got to be multimedia
and multinational now," says Berlusconi lieutenant Fedele
Confalonieri. Under Mr. Berlusconi's guidance, he contends,
Mondadori would spread its interests beyond Italy and compete
with other global press magnates, like Rupert Murdoch and
Robert Maxwell.
   A lot of ego is involved in the Mondadori struggle. Both
entrepreneurs are self-made megamillionaires of the same
generation who rocketed into prominence about the same time.
In a country where so few people control so much of the
economy, perhaps the only surprise is that they hadn't
clashed publicly before.
   Mr. De Benedetti is 55 years old, the son of a Jewish
family that fled to Switzerland during World War II to escape
Fascist persecution. He started in his family's small machine
shop and built it into a thriving concern before leaving for
a top post at Fiat. His personality and ambitions eventually
rubbed against Mr. Agnelli's, and he left Fiat in a parting
as dramatic in Italian business circles as was Lee Iacocca's
exit from Ford in the U.S. in 1978.
   Mr. De Benedetti wound up at Olivetti, then a sickly
typewriter manufacturer, and turned it into a major computer
company. At the same time, he invested his own and other
people's money in a wide range of ventures: Buitoni pasta,
which he later sold to Nestle S.A.; a slice of French fashion
house Yves Saint Laurent; and various finance and publishing
firms.
   During the 1980s, bull markets helped him turn assets of
$2 million in his personal investment companies into a
conglomerate, called Cofide, which controls assets now valued
on stock markets at nearly $7 billion. He's one of Italy's
richest men.
   But he isn't standing still. The "easy finance" that made
him so wealthy in the last decade is over, Mr. De Benedetti
says. In the 1990s, "I'll get back to what I'm capable of
doing, which is running industry, during a great period of
reindustrialization."
   Entrepreneurs on both sides of the Atlantic are professing
renewed interest in the nurturing of industry, now that
corporate raiders, leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds are in
bad odor. All the more reason for his rivals to insist that
Mr. De Benedetti remains a kind of wheeler-dealer.
   "De Benedetti is above all a man of finance," says Mr.
Confalonieri, general manager of Mr. Berlusconi's holding
company. "Berlusconi is a man of industry, a builder from
zero. That's the difference."
   It's a distinction lost on many Italians. They see
numerous similarities in the men's careers, particularly
their swift climb to riches.
   Mr. Berlusconi, the son of a Milan banker, worked at
various jobs including stints as a singer at Adriatic Sea
resorts and as a tour guide around the country before getting
a law degree and setting up a construction company. He made
an initial fortune building residential projects, and burst
on the Italian business scene by forming the first national
television network in 1978. While technically such networks
were illegal, Mr. Berlusconi slipped through a loophole: He
bought up hundreds of local stations, and sent them cassettes
of recorded programs, often by messengers on motorbikes, for
simultaneous broadcasting.
   He still isn't allowed to beam live news or sports. And
while his programs aren't necessarily uplifting -- game
shows, "Dynasty" and cheap-to-produce talk shows are the
typical fare -- they are hugely successful.
   Mr. Berlusconi, 53, now owns two other Italian networks,
controls more than a third of the advertising revenue on
Italian TV and owns a Milan daily newspaper, Il Giornale. He
also owns all or part of stations in France, Spain, West
Germany and Yugoslavia. Other properties include Italy's
biggest department store chain, La Standa; a chain of movie
theaters; the AC Milan soccer team; and insurance, financial
service and real estate companies. His 100%-owned Fininvest
S.p.A. has consolidated annual sales of close to $10 billion,
and reported a profit of $152 million in 1988.
   With a fortune estimated between $1 billion and $2.5
billion, Mr. Berlusconi, too, is among Italy's richest men.
He looks the part, with his elegant clothes and smoothed-back
hair, as he shuttles among sumptuous homes all over Europe.
   For now, though, the Mondadori mess has grounded him in
Italy.
   Last week, his rival Mr. De Benedetti won a round when a
Milan court ruled in his favor on a technical matter that
would unblock voting rights of 16.4% more of Mondadori's
holding company, depriving Mr. Berlusconi of his majority
there. Today, at a special Mondadori shareholders' meeting,
Mr. De Benedetti will try to push through a capital increase
of 320 billion lire ($256 million) that would help the
company pay its debts of more than 400 billion lire. Such a
capital increase would also give him control of the common
shares and put him back in the chairman's seat. Mr.
Berlusconi has proposed a smaller capital increase, under
which he would retain majority control of the common shares.
But Mr. De Benedetti, with his authority over holders of
preferred stock, can, and almost certainly will, block this
proposal.
   Meanwhile, the whole matter remains before assorted Milan
and Rome courts and tribunals, and may not be resolved for
months. Last week, Mr. Berlusconi hinted he was ready to
negotiate a settlement, but yesterday Mr. De Benedetti said
chances of an early accord are "dead."
   The climate for negotiations hasn't been helped by the
media spotlight. Editors at La Repubblica and Panorama have
mercilessly attacked their nominal boss, Mr. Berlusconi, in
print, dragging up his past association with a now-dissolved
Masonic lodge, P-2. Some P-2 members -- though not Mr.
Berlusconi -- were accused of various plots against the
government in the late 1970s. Mr. Berlusconi hasn't attempted
to replace these editors, perhaps because he fears a public
outcry.
   De Benedetti aides, on the other hand, are incensed by
what they allege to be attempts by Mr. Berlusconi, using his
political connections, to embarrass their boss. Recently, for
example, Mr. De Benedetti was summoned to give testimony in a
trial that touched on the decade-old Banco Ambrosiano
scandal, which involved the mysterious suicide of banker
Roberto Calvi in London amid allegations of the misuse of
funds by the Vatican Bank in the late 1970s.
   Mr. De Benedetti had become vice-chairman of Banco
Ambrosiano for two months to help try to clean it up, and
several investigations have found that he acted blamelessly.
But the latest Ambrosiano court hearing was held three days
before a crucial Mondadori shareholders' meeting -- and De
Benedetti allies don't think the timing was accidental.
   Just when the Mondadori affair will end is anybody's
guess. The most probable outcome, both sides hint, is a
breakup of the company that would give Mr. De Benedetti
control of La Repubblica, a string of local newspapers and
L'Espresso magazine, while Mr. Berlusconi would get Panorama
magazine and the book publishing business.
   "De Benedetti has got to win Mondadori, or at least La
Repubblica, for the sake of the rule of law in Italy," says a
banker involved in the battle who asks for anonymity. "He had
a contract {for the shares held by Formenton family}. If he
loses what are contracts worth here?"
   There are also other reasons Mr. De Benedetti is perceived
to have more of a stake than his rival. He has suffered a
number of setbacks over the past two years. While long known
as a visionary who was ahead of the pack on 1992, on Eastern
Europe, and on the need for global alliances, others have
seemed to benefit more from his ideas recently than he has.
   Mr. De Benedetti's bold bid to create a pan-European
holding company by buying Societe General de Belgique was
thwarted by management allied with Cie. Financiere de Suez of
France. An accord between his Olivetti and American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co., which was to marry computers and telephone
technology, collapsed when neither partner saw much benefit
from it. His move into Hungary via a new holding company is
promising, but now Mr. De Benedetti is far from alone:
Budapest teems with investment bankers seeking to put cash in
Hungarian companies as a foothold into Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.
   "His image is tarnished," says Chris Moore, Italian
securities analyst for Morgan Stanley International in Milan.
Mr. Moore sees growing problems in Mr. De Benedetti's
flagship, Olivetti, where, according to company executives,
earnings last year fell by as much as 45%. Olivetti's stock
price is near the low end of its range over the last 12
months.
   Why then has Mr. De Benedetti let himself get so enmeshed
in the Mondadori dispute? "It's very simple," he says. "There
is only one way to never get into battles: Don't move. If you
don't act, if you stay where you are, then you just keep what
you have."
   Mr. Berlusconi, for his part, is hoping that once the
Mondadori conflict is resolved he can focus again on a
grander vision: to reverse the decades-old dominance of
European airwaves by American television shows. "We've got to
challenge the one-way flow of programs from the U.S. to
Europe by making more of our own," he told a business
conference in Venice last year. And with satellite
transmission opening up TV markets across the continent, Mr.
Berlusconi's inventory of over 70,000 hours of his own
programs looks like a potential bonanza.
   "I hope to fly high in the new great, free skies of Europe
to come," he said.

   Westinghouse Gets
   $500 Million Job
   For British Plant

   PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it received
a $500 million order to supply power generating equipment to
Enron Power Corp., a unit of Enron Corp., Houston.
   The equipment, to be produced by Westinghouse and its
joint venture partner, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan,
will be used in Britain's $1 billion Teesside Power Project.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The contract is significant because it provides the
six-month-old Westinghouse-Mitsubishi joint venture a key
foothold in the European market and an opportunity to
demonstrate whether the two companies can work together under
tight deadlines. The plant is scheduled to begin commercial
operation in early 1993.
   Westinghouse said its initial order is for eight
169-megawatt combustion turbine-generators and two
216-megawatt steam turbine-generators. The company also said
it was awarded an exclusive option to supply 10 additional
combustion turbine-generators.
   A Westinghouse spokeswoman declined to break out the
amounts it will receive under each order, but some people in
the industry valued the initial contract at between $200
million and $250 million. Westinghouse, which has been
expanding its North American capacity to meet the revival in
demand for combustion turbines, wouldn't say how much of the
equipment would be produced by Mitsubishi.
   Westinghouse said Britain's Brush Electrical Machines Ltd.
will also provide some of the steam turbines.
   Last year Westinghouse said its orders for power
generation equipment jumped about 20%. Those bookings
amounted to about 2,000 megawatts of generation, according to
Westinghouse's recently released annual report. The
Westinghouse spokeswoman said the company currently has a
backlog of power generation equipment orders of about $1
billion.
   Enron's order roughly equals all of Westinghouse's power
generation equipment orders received last year. Teesside
alone is a 1,725 megawatt natural gas-fired cogeneration
power plant, said to be one of the world's largest.
   Enron will design and build the project on the northeast
coast of England. Electricity produced at the plant will be
sold to ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd. and other customers in
the United Kingdom, Westinghouse said. The plant will be
England's first independent power producer.
   Westinghouse also has significant interests in
broadcasting, financial services, over-the-road refrigeration
and electronic systems.

   A FUNDING PINCH hampers states' jobless-pay operations.
   A $121 million fiscal 1990 shortfall in federal funds,
caused by a rising unemployment-compensation workload and
Gramm-Rudman budget cuts, is forcing Indiana to slash costs
20%. Claims offices were trimmed to 26 from 43, with 100 of
740 workers laid off. Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and
Texas also plan office closings, layoffs or reduced hours,
mainly for temporary help used for peaks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New Hampshire, where the workload has nearly tripled
from last year, the staff is down 7%. Officials "steal"
claims workers from other jobs, such as tax collecting; but
waits in claims lines, usually a half hour, still climb to
three to five hours. California shelves control efforts that
try to avoid wrong payments or nonpayments.
   A House bill would add funding, but the Bush
administration opposes release of more of the
employer-financed funds, short of "a dire emergency."
                                                                                                       

   THE WHITE HOUSE favors naming a rail-labor emergency
board.
   Officials say the president would form the panel to avert
a nationwide railroad strike. Railroads and 12 negotiating
unions both want the board, and the National Mediation Board
probably will declare a bargaining impasse soon. The next
step is the emergency panel. Health costs, soaring over 15% a
year, are the biggest issue; the railroads want worker $100
deductibles and $2,000 out-of-pocket medical-bill limits
raised.
   The roads seek work-crew cuts, freedom to assign work as
they wish and the right to contract out more, among
work-rules changes; they also want to trim wages, unions say.
The unions want 5% pay boosts every six months, job
protection in short-line sales and an end to some
subcontracting.
                                                                                                       

   CHILD-LABOR POLICE will step up enforcement still more.
   New sweeps of employers are planned -- one before school
is out and another in the fall. A recent three-day blitz
found 9,300 violations including kids working late or long
hours, instead of the 7,000 estimated at the time, officials
say. Fines will reach $2.5 million, rather than $1.8 million.
Violations will be announced in bunches, starting today.
   The Labor Department's Employment Standards and
Occupational Safety and Health agencies will sign an
agreement this week for investigators at both agencies to
swap data on child-labor and safety violations. "Sweat-shop"
investigators often find chained rear doors, for instance, a
danger in a fire. Similar plans are afoot with state
worker-safety agencies.
   In a labor pinch, "some employers cut legal corners" by
filling low-level jobs with children, says William Brooks,
the Employment Standards chief.
                                                                                                       

   NO FOLLOW-THROUGH? Though 73% of 491 employers polled by
placement consultant Right Associates expect a skilled-labor
shortage, three-fourths don't have a plan to keep most-needed
workers. Of those who foresee problems, 44% predict higher
training costs and 43% expect increased pay and benefits to
recruit new workers.
                                                                                                       

   THE MINIMUM WAGE rose to $3.80 an hour Sunday, but the
Labor Department estimates that employers can pay the new
short-term $3.35 training wage for as many as 3.7 million
teen-agers. But finding youths at the minimum already is
tough. "You're not going to find people . . . to work for a
sub-minimum," says Arby's.
                                                                                                       

   THE SILVER LINING? The business of finding jobs for fired
executives will climb 15% to 17% this year, topping $400
million, the Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms
says. Lenders, builders and developers, reeling from weak
real-estate markets, contribute to the placement surge.
                                                                                                       

   AUTO WORKER RETIREES plump for automatic cost-of-living
adjustments to their pensions. They lobby for the UAW to make
retiree COLAs a priority bargaining item. Canadian auto
workers won the benefit from auto makers in 1987. But only 3%
of all U.S. pensioners have such COLAs, the Pension Rights
Center says.
                                                                                                       

   GETTING TOUGHER: Firms push harder to share health costs
with workers.
   Fully 45% of 1,943 employers surveyed by consultant Foster
Higgins in 1989 required employee contributions to premiums
for individual coverage, up from 39% in 1988, and 75%
required contributions for dependents, compared with 69%.
Employee shares had held steady since '86, declining slightly
in '87 and '88. Average worker contributions eased a bit in
1989, to $23.03 for employee-only and $69.46 for dependent
coverage.
   But more than a fourth of the companies plan to increase
the employee contribution this year. Individual deductibles
of more than $100 were required by 60% of employers and
family deductibles of more than $300 by 49%, up from 51% and

   NEW YORK -- The Resolution Trust Corp. has eased its
restrictions for hiring accounting firms that had been sued
by the government for thrift-reorganization work.
   A memo issued late last month by Resolution Trust says
that even though the accounting firm may have been sued by
thrift or bank regulators, it can be hired for reorganization
work under certain conditions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The accounting firm must show that those employees and
offices doing the reorganization work weren't involved in the
previous litigation, the memo says. The firm must also
centrally monitor compliance with the screening out of those
employees previously involved in the litigation, the memo
says.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., said a previous policy to avoid using
accounting firms that had been sued was being misunderstood.
"While it's still true that an accounting firm that hasn't
previously been sued in thrift or bank work would be
preferred, we're giving more leeway to hire firms which had
been sued, since they may be the low bidder with expertise
for reorganization jobs," he added.

   Erskine Henderson Appears to Lead
   Candidates for Appointment to SEC

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
EXECUTIVE (EXE)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The White House is close to nominating
Erskine Henderson, a New York securities lawyer, to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, administration sources
said.
   Mr. Henderson, who would be the second black commissioner
in the SEC's history, is a special counsel at Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, a New York law firm known for its
mergers and acquisitions work. Mr. Henderson specializes in
securities and takeover litigation, and colleagues at the
firm said he has experience in accounting law although he
isn't an accountant.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   White House sources insisted that no decision has been
made, and that the background check on Mr. Henderson hasn't
been completed. One administration insider said that it could
be two months before the White House offers a nomination, but
that Mr. Henderson heads the short list of candidates. Others
mentioned include Washington lawyers Bruce Mendelsohn, Albert
Beveridge and Mahlon Frankhauser.
   If nominated, Mr. Henderson would fill the Democratic
commission slot left open by the January resignation of
Joseph Grundfest, a staunch free-marketeer who is now a
Stanford University Business School professor.
   The recent swearing-in of former Time Warner Inc. lawyer
Philip Lochner Jr. gives Chairman Richard Breeden a virtual
hammerlock on the five-member commission. It isn't clear how
the nomination of Mr. Henderson might affect agency policy.
   While Mr. Lochner hasn't yet voted at an open meeting, his
statements at his Senate confirmation hearing showed a
similar political bent to that of the chairman. Mr. Breeden
has pushed hard to expand the SEC's enforcement program and
to broaden the agency's jurisdiction over disclosure by
brokerage firms. Another commissioner, Mary Schapiro, often
sides with Mr. Breeden in commission votes.
   Edward Fleischman, who predates Mr. Breeden at the
commission by several years, has begun to emerge as the
agency's most dissident voice. He disagrees with the chairman
on the SEC's most controversial issue -- the chairman's
desire to regulate stock-index futures, which are now
overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   Mr. Henderson, 40 years old, couldn't be reached for
comment. But colleagues describe him as a team player without
much ideological fervor. He has been a lawyer at Skadden Arps
for about 11 years following his graduation from Columbia
University Law School.
   He has represented a number of companies in takeover
situations, including Hammermill Paper Co. in the company's
effort to fend off a foray early in Carl Icahn's career.

   Business World:
   Continental Bank's Pilots Say
   They're Above the Credit Clouds
   ----

BANKS (BNK)
</IN>
<LP>
   CHICAGO -- No credit chill is felt in the second-floor
office of Continental Bank's chairman. Coatless on a cool
rainy day, Thomas Theobald and his deputy for corporate
deals, Vice Chairman Garry Scheuring, remain hot on leverage
as a tool for repairing U.S. competitiveness.
   Since arriving from Citicorp three years ago, Mr.
Theobald, 52, has transformed the big, money-center
institution known as Continental Illinois into a smaller
business bank. Few retail depositors now traipse to tellers
in the grand lobby outside the chairman's quarters. The new
Continental sees itself in the Morgan Guaranty mold, but
reaching out to 2,000 companies instead of only the Fortune
200. Despite the pinch on commercial borrowing in the
American economy, no one's crying ouch here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There's adequate liquidity around," says Mr. Scheuring.
"In some pockets, there have been banks that pulled back. I
don't see it in the target customer base that we look at.
Certainly smaller home builders that rely on S&amp;Ls don't have
the credit facilities that they used to have. At the other
end, larger transactions, HLTs (high-leverage) will be harder
to do. There will be more diligence and screening, but I
think today good businesses have finance available. But at
the edge, small companies, this is a factor."
   Mr. Scheuring, who at 50 has risen in 26 years with the
bank, suggests what that "factor" means: "We have an economy
that's growing at about 1%. It doesn't take much to make 1% a
minus 1%. I have a hard time reading that because this is
really unparalled in our experience -- when there's adequate
money but it doesn't want to go. You have enough of that
happen I suppose you do have the possibility of a negative.
On the other hand, it puts a discipline in the system that's
probably OK. Our customers (include) a couple of the largest
home builders in California. They have no problem. Their
small 4- or 5-building competitor who has no equity and wants
to borrow it all can't do it."
   Mr. Theobald, meantime, isn't criticizing recent rule
making for whatever contraction is being felt at banks: "In
Boston, you might say it's the regulators, but when you talk
about Bank of America or Wells Fargo (which he sees
retreating from some areas), those are market-induced
strategic decisions." In his view, government is to blame in
the longer run, for restrictions on interstate banking: "If
you go back to the political fault, it was sectioning off the
country into these local markets. It ruined the Texas banks,
it's doing a lot of of damage to the New England banks. Those
are dangerous portfolio inducements." Continental, still
among U.S. banking's Top 25, is expanding out from its
region.
   One regulator nod to the "market" has the chairman wary.
That's the increasing resort to "mark to market" accounting
of high-yield assets, which Continental uses in client
restructurings. "Philosophically, I support mark-to-market,"
Mr. Theobald says. "But if you look at the practical,
near-term proposals, they are bastardizations of the idea.
What most of them say is let's pick some selective asset and
mark it down to market. But we'll certainly not permit mark
up of other assets, or we will not permit you to adjust
liabilities according to their value. If you take a British
bank . . . every one, two or three years, they revalue their
real estate. Or Japanese banks have equity securities that
are worth a lot more than book values. If you want to say to
any one of us, let's mark the whole balance sheet to market,
fine."
   In any case, he says, "We have several times done detailed
analyses here of marking everything to market, and
ironically, it doesn't come out much different. The law of
large numbers." But with thrifts forced to sell everything
the regulators consider "junk" and mutual-fund redemptions
aggravating the price slide in that market, valuation is
dicier. "If you're an S&amp;L or a commercial bank," Mr. Theobald
says, "you might legitimately ask whether it's reasonable to
have the kind of mentality that's allegedly caused all kinds
of distortions in the industrialized economy visited on them.
You know -- the market's value today is the answer, the
truth."
   That's not Wall Street talking. Mr. Theobald emphasizes
he's a company banker. The 146 high-yield deals that
Continental has done don't reflect a desire to empower
financiers -- just the opposite, he says. "People who are
focused on some business, live it and die it, generally do
better than people who work off spread sheets and financial
analysis. A lot of what I see as the virtue of the LBOs, HLTs
and so on is that they are leading to more focused
companies." Even the takeovers? "If you look at the RJR
transaction, and say what was the beginning to end of it, it
was going to be spin-outs. While initially it was gathering
in all these food assets, it was structured in such a way
that they had to redistribute them."
   In fact, fundamentals dominate in Mr. Theobald's world.
But don't high real interest or "hurdle" rates shape a
business's decision to buy new machinery vs. take cash out?
"I've never seen it in my career. You can analyze a market to
read in some of those macro factors, but I don't see
businessmen making their decisions with overt weight given to
that kind of consideration. If there's more demand for a
product, they want to expand. If somebody's available to buy
that makes a great synergy, they want to buy. Most of them
look through currency rates and interest rates. And I'm not
sure they're wrong, because currencies and interest rates
fluctuate so much that if you're making a 5- or 10-year
decision, what are you going to do?"
   Mr. Theobald disparages congressional credit allocation
incentives, such as moves to raise reserve requirements for
high-yield lending, as "really Third World stuff." Meanwhile,
his bank may finally have other Third World stuff, the
writedown of bad loans to backward nations, behind it. Also,
it isn't too exposed in real estate. Yet Continental's share
price is at a two-year low. Malaise is industrywide, but
analysts worry that new HLTs will be scant and existing ones
rocky.
   This bank's particular claim to notoriety remains the 1982
federal bailout of its depositors, the biggest in U.S.
financial history and the hall mark of the "too big to fail"
doctrine that chills the climate for deposit-insurance
reform. (Smaller banks say they need the existing guarantee
of at least $100,000 per deposit in order to compete with
major rivals that enjoy de facto backup.) But Mr. Theobald
offers a footnote on that affair: Internal calculations
suggest that had the feds not stepped in, maybe $1.5 billion
of Continental's $40 billion in deposits would have been
lost.
   A haircut that slight suggests it's more feasible to let
the marketplace discipline risky financiers -- and avoid
artificial credit crunches -- than Washington now believes.

   Psyllium's Ability
   To Cut Cholesterol
   Backed by Studies

   WASHINGTON -- Three new studies financed by Kellogg Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich., found that cereal laced with the grain
psyllium reduces cholesterol. But the findings may touch off
a fresh round of health claims and counterclaims similar to
the dispute over the benefits of oat bran.
   All three of the new studies tested people with high
cholesterol levels who had already been put on
low-cholesterol diets. The addition of psyllium, which is
high in soluble fiber, further reduced cholesterol levels and
lowered cholesterol more than other fibers, including oat
bran, they found.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a result, the Kellogg-financed researchers said, cereal
containing psyllium can reduce the risk of heart disease by
fighting cholesterol-clogging of the arteries. Kellogg, which
orchestrated a big public-relations effort to promote the new
studies, sells Heartwise, the only cereal with psyllium sold
nationwide by a major cereal company. But psyllium isn't
without controversy. Last year, the Food and Drug
Administration looked into the safety of its use in large
quantities in cereal. In response, General Mills Inc. took a
psyllium-based cereal off the market.
   Psyllium, also known as flea wort, is grown primarily in
India. It has been used for years by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in
its laxative Metamucil. The new studies, which were released
at the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies
for Experimental Biology here, all concluded that psyllium is
safe in cereals, although some of those in the tests reported
such effects as gas, bloating and cramping -- symptoms common
to a sudden increase in fiber consumption.
   All three studies measured the impact of psyllium after
the subjects had been put on a low-fat diet and fed cereal
supplied by Kellogg. The studies were conducted at the
University of Kentucky, George Washington University, and the
University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.
   A Kellogg spokeswoman said, "We're encouraged by the
studies," but she wouldn't say how they might influence the
company's marketing plans for Heartwise, which isn't a big
seller, or other new cereals.

   NEW YORK -- Investors sold stocks on concerns about bad
first-quarter earnings, the plunging Tokyo stock market, and
the belief that interest rates won't fall anytime soon.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.76 to 2700.45.
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 1.24 to 338.70. For
the quarter, the S&amp;P 500 finished down 3% on a total return
basis. Volume totaled 124,360,000 shares on the New York
Stock Exchange, where declining issues swamped advancers
1,122 to 434.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Byron Wien, U.S. investment strategist for Morgan Stanley,
boosted the cash position in his model all-stock portfolio to
10% yesterday from 3%. "I felt that sentiment had driven the
market," he explained. "To move up the next leg, the market
needs help from interest rates. While I am optimistic, I
wanted hope and reason to be in better balance."
   Mr. Wien's colleague, Barton Biggs, chairman of Morgan
Stanley Asset Management, said he recently raised cash levels
to 15% in his global portfolio, reducing the equity portion
to 45% from 55%. The bond portion remains at 40%.
   Mr. Biggs said he is concerned about the decline in Tokyo
shares. "I think a 32% decline in the biggest market in the
world is an event," he said. "I think our market is de-linked
from ordinary performance in Japan, but not from a financial
panic." He added that margin calls and credit scares in Japan
could be two factors that create selling in other markets.
   "I think there are going to be aftershocks; it will ripple
through all markets," said Mr. Biggs, who added that he wants
more cash on hand to hunt for values if stock markets tumble.
   Disappointing earnings news from Network Equipment
Technologies sent the stock plummeting 6 3/8 to 23 1/2 on 1.8
million shares. The company said it expects revenue and net
income for the March quarter to be significantly lower than
it had anticipated, with per-share earnings possibly falling
short of 33 cents a year earlier.
   The first quarter's dividend activity confirms the dismal
state of corporate profits, according to Arnold Kaufman,
editor of Standard &amp; Poor's "Outlook" newsletter.
   "There has been a downtrend in corporate profits since
1988 and dividends are starting to reflect that very
clearly," said Mr. Kaufman.
   S&amp;P, surveying 7,557 companies, found that dividend
increases shrank to 414 in the first quarter, down 20.5% from
the same period a year earlier. The number of dividend
decreases and omissions rose 64.5% to 79 in the first quarter
from the same period in 1989.
   "We are not going to see an improvement through the rest
of this year," Mr. Kaufman predicted.
   Several of the put warrants on Tokyo Nikkei stock index
topped the most active list on the American Stock Exchange
yesterday. Nikkei put warrants allow investors to bet on a
decline in the Tokyo stock market. The Denmark issue closed
up 3/4 to 11 3/4; the January 1993 Salomon Brothers issue
rose 5/8 to 10 7/8; a February 1993 issue from Salomon gained
7/8 to 11 3/4, and the Bankers Trust issue rose 1 to 25 3/4.
   American General dropped 1 7/8 to 36 3/4 on 1.2 million
shares. Torchmark withdrew its bid to acquire the company for
$50 a share in cash and stock and said it would wage a proxy
fight for five board seats. American General turned down
Torchmark's slate, however, contending it wasn't submitted by
a deadline for nominations set in its bylaws. Torchmark rose
1/4 to 45 1/2.
   Pfizer slipped 1 5/8 to 59 on 1.1 million shares. Barron's
magazine reported that the company faces a potentially "huge
liability" if it loses a lawsuit, filed by a recipient of one
of the heart valves once made by its Shiley unit. The suit
seeks damages for anxiety resulting from the news of problems
with the valve. The report included several documents
indicating that the company was aware of potential hazards
with the valve but urged doctors not to publicize them.
   Fleet/Norstar Financial Group fell 5/8 to 21 1/4 on 1.8
million shares after disclosing that it is being examined by
federal and state banking regulators. The company said it
might have to boost its loan-loss reserve, based on their
findings.
   Unocal rose 1 3/4 to 33 5/8 on 1.3 million shares amid
continued speculation that British Petroleum may be
interested in taking over the company. BP declined comment;
the stock fell 1 3/4 to 63 as a sell-off on the London market
hurt shares of British companies traded in the U.S.
   Motorola rose 1 to 66 after a federal court stayed an
injunction against sales of the company's flagship
microprocessor. The ban had been imposed as part of the
court's decision in a patent-infringement case between
Motorola and Hitachi.
   Digital Equipment gained 3/8 to 77 1/8 in advance of
today's expected introduction of new engineering
workstations. Compaq Computer, which unveiled a high-speed
controller for use in computer networks, climbed 2 1/8 to 97
5/8.
   UAL fell 7/8 to 161 1/8 amid continuing discussions about
a buy-out bid from the three major unions at its United
Airlines unit. The group is offering cash and securities
valued at $185 a share.
   Wheelabrator Technologies rose 1 1/2 to 35. Waste
Management agreed to increase its stake in the company to 55%
from 22% through a stock swap. Waste Management rose 1/8 to
34 1/4.
   Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust rose 5/8 to 8 1/8 after reaching a
preliminary agreement with a group of lenders for $425
million in financing. Shares of the trust dropped sharply
last month after it didn't make a payment on a note issue;
Mortgage &amp; Realty said the funding would permit it to make
that payment, among other things.
   General Development dropped 1 7/8 to 4. The company said
it hadn't been able to reach agreement on a $60 million
credit facility over the weekend and it is considering a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, along with alternatives.
   West Point-Pepperell fell 1 1/4 to 37. The company that is
holding investor William Farley's stake in Pepperell
defaulted on $796 million in bank debt and on interest
payments due on $705 million in subordinated debt.
   Hotel Investors Corp. fell 1/2 to 4 1/2 after reporting a
$60.3 million loss for 1989, reflecting a $55.8 million
provision for losses on its hotel and gaming properties and
goodwill. The company also cut back an agreed-upon sale of
some of its hotel interests.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.38
to 359.37. Volume on the American Stock Exchange was
14,490,000. There were 405 issues declining and 165
advancing.
   New Line Cinema rose 1/2 to 11 3/8. The company said its
new movie, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," grossed
approximately $25.4 million in its first weekend at the box
office.

   Record Loss
   In First Quarter

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. said it
expects a first-quarter loss of $897 million to $917 million
-- a securities-industry record -- as it finally pays the
bill for some of its overexpansion in the 1980s.
   In a series of announcements, the nation's second-biggest
securities firm said it is dissolving its troubled Balcor Co.
real-estate unit; closing 67 of its U.S. branch offices;
ceasing the creation of limited-partnership investments;
pulling back from international operations; and attempting to
sell its investment portfolio of high-yield "junk" bonds,
which it values at $480 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The moves, many of them expected, are part of the American
Express Co. unit's effort to pare itself back to a manageable
size. They culminate months of turmoil at Shearson as the
brokerage firm scrambled to head off a threatened downgrading
of its credit ratings. Last week, to enable the big charges
against earnings, Shearson received a cash infusion of $750
million from American Express, which currently owns 61% of
Shearson and is in the process of acquiring the rest of
Shearson's common shares outstanding.
   Included in Shearson's loss are charges against earnings
totaling $787 million. Shearson's charge against earnings to
pay for the retrenchment plan will be about $630 million,
Shearson said. That's the biggest such charge in
securities-industry history, topping Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s
$470 million pretax fourth-quarter charge to pay for that
firm's own retrenchment plan. Shearson is also taking a $157
million charge to reflect a change in how
software-development costs are accounted for. Neither of
Shearson's charges have immediate tax benefits.
   With the record charge-offs, Shearson becomes the latest
big Wall Street securities firm to take harsh financial
measures to adapt to the deep recession in the securities
industry. The slump has produced layoffs of nearly 45,000
employees nationwide since the 1987 stock-market crash and
hastened the collapse of one major firm, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc.
   Just last week, General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody
Group Inc. unit announced a recapitalization that enabled GE
to inject $550 million in cash into Kidder, partly through
the sale of Kidder's junk-bond inventory to its parent. Other
firms such as CS First Boston Inc. have also had to turn to
their parents to bolster them.
   The major credit-rating agencies responded favorably to
Shearson's latest moves, with both Moody's Investors Service
Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. affirming Shearson's credit
ratings.
   Yet those affirmations aren't resounding, say analysts.
The affirmations are based mostly on deep-pocketed American
Express's shows of support for its unit, rather than optimism
about Shearson's prospects. "Shearson's ratings are now even
more dependent on Amex than they were before," said Jeffrey
Bowman, an S&amp;P vice president. Shearson's "capital levels
remain low relative to the company's asset mix," he said.
   As previously reported, Shearson would have had a loss for
the first quarter even without the restructuring. In
yesterday's announcements, the firm said it sustained an
operating loss for the quarter of between $110 million and
$130 million, which it blamed on an overall slowdown in
business and "industry conditions" during January and
February. Operating revenue at Shearson improved in March,
the firm said.
   Shearson officials, in interviews and in discussions with
employees yesterday, tried to portray the firm as having a
bright future now that it has bitten the bullet on its
financial problems.
   Howard L. Clark Jr., the former American Express chief
financial officer recently installed as Shearson's chairman
and chief executive, said in an interview: "We have
aggressively moved forward on this, addressing the balance
sheet of the company. I think, as they say at American
Express, we're ahead of the curve, by aggressively focusing
on the balance sheet. Now we want to focus on profitability."
   But some analysts expressed concern that Shearson's
problems aren't necessarily over. "They've gone and very
carefully looked at financing requirements, looked at the
operating needs," said John Keefe, financial services analyst
at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New York. But "it's beyond
anyone's capabilities to say this is a sufficient provision.
It's anybody's guess, because market conditions are still so
fragile."
   Indeed, while Shearson said it will have more than $2
billion in equity capital after the write-downs, S&amp;P
calculates the firm's "tangible" net capital as around $400
million -- and said that level "provides marginal cushion
against operating and other risks, such as the company's
sizable $500 million bridge loan to Prime Computer Inc.
Shearson's capital levels could further weaken if first
quarter operating losses and modest junk bond markdowns
continue."
   In the interview, Mr. Clark said there are no plans for
additional mass layoffs at Shearson after the round of 2,000
job cuts announced in late February and being completed now.
And he sought to dispel speculation that American Express is
merely trying to get Shearson on its feet as a precursor to
selling the firm. Shearson may indeed one day be sold, say
analysts, but Mr. Clark said it wouldn't be in the near
future.
   "I was not sent down to Shearson by American Express to
fix it, package it and sell it; I was sent to run it," Mr.
Clark said. He added: "But I think speculation about what
might happen three, four, five years from now is irrelevant
to the process."
   James D. Robinson III -- the American Express chairman who
in January ousted Peter A. Cohen as Shearson's chief and
replaced him with Mr. Clark -- said in a statement that the
Shearson announcements "signal the start of a new era for the
firm." He said that "Howard Clark and his team have our full
support as they move to reduce Shearson's risk profile and
get back to basics by focusing on the things they do best."
   The statement emphasized American Express's view that
Shearson's woes are byproducts of Shearson's aggressive
expansion in the 1980s under Mr. Cohen. This expansion
included the purchase -- ill-advised, Mr. Robinson now says
-- of ailing broker E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. just after the stock
market crash.
   Shearson's large role in selling limited partnership
investments, a Hutton specialty, is also being fingered these
days as a mistake. That's why Shearson now says it will no
longer originate any partnership investments, although it
will still sell other firms' investments if a client wants
it. Shearson had been the biggest purveyor of limited
partnership investments in 1988, before cutting back.
   Mr. Clark was blunt about Shearson's stumbles in limited
partnerships, many of which have gone sour and led to
investor lawsuits against the company. The partnerships'
troubles were exacerbated by tax-law changes that took away
tax-shelter benefits, and problems with partnerships aren't
confined to Shearson. Still, Mr. Clark said that in
retrospect, "I don't think we controlled the quality of the
partnerships we sold adequately. . . . Wall Street in general
has done a lousy job of selecting and selling limited
partnerships."
   Many of the partnerships now dogging Shearson were sold by
the Skokie, Ill.based Balcor unit, a real-estate operation
that represents the antithesis of the "basics" that American
Express now stresses for Shearson.
   Of the $630 million restructuring charge, about $200
million is for estimated losses at Balcor as it pulls out of
all commercial real-estate activities and the origination of
limited partnerships, and sells its portfolio of loans.
Shearson retained Edward S. Gordon Co. to direct the winding
down of Balcor.
   The restructuring charge also includes about $170 million
in expenses to consolidate corporate office facilities and
shut 67 of Shearson's 500 branches, and about $60 million to
close certain international offices. And about $45 million of
the charge is for severance costs after the 2,000 layoffs.
   Finally, about $115 million of the charge reflects losses
to be taken in the planned sale of the $480 million in junk
bonds, which includes $290 million in mutual funds.

   That's No Okie, That's My Torts Professor

   In my first year at Harvard Law School I was surprised to
see one of my professors wearing lace-up, leather work boots
to class. I could think of no good reason for a Harvard law
professor to be wearing the cumbersome, awkward-looking boots
that were disparagingly known as "longhorns" back on the farm
in Idaho.
   Those boots reminded me of the physical and economic
difficulty of life in rural America: They were disturbing
symbols of a past I was trying desperately to escape. The
smooth, clean surface of the professor's boots suggested that
he had no experience with farming, or any other demanding
physical labor for that matter. So why would this prosperous
and cultured man wear the boots that I would have been
ashamed to wear in public?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An informed classmate explained to me that the boots were
a statement about the professor's left-wing ideological
orientation: "Like a Mao suit, they are intended to convey
the message that he has thrown his lot in with the common
man."
   Solidarity with the common man as against his capitalist
oppressors is of course a familiar posture in the
universities. But it would shock my left-leaning,
boot-wearing professor's self-image to hear that the common
man has at least as much contempt for intellectuals as for
the rich. Just who is really suffering from false
consciousness?
   The school's most notorious left-wing professor, Duncan
Kennedy, proposed some years ago in a locally famous article
that all Harvard law professors regularly change places with
the school's janitors. I interviewed 20 of the law school's
custodial staff to find out what they thought of the idea,
something Mr. Kennedy had evidently never bothered to do.
Here are a few of their replies:
   -- "The only thing worse than scrubbing a toilet would be
to have to pretend to be some fancy-pants, egghead college
professor, usually some dweeby guy who could never do
anything well but read books."
   -- "Tell this professor of yours to mind his own damn
business] The world would be a lot better off without some
screwed up, overeducated college brat telling the rest of us
how to live our lives."
   -- "I might be a janitor, but does this guy really think
we are stupid enough to believe him? It's all showbiz
blabbermouth crap] If he were really that concerned about the
work we do, he'd offer to come help us once in a while,
rather than just talking it up to the world. I haven't seen
any law professor busting his butt to come buff floors with
me. Most probably don't know how] We can't even get them to
empty their own trash] I'd settle for that, rather than some
highfalutin, job swapping idea that this guy knows would
never happen in a million years. Maybe he can sell that line
to a bunch of fruitcake students, but he sure can't fool us
janitors."
   Then I sprang Mr. Kennedy's proposal on my grandfather, an
elementary school janitor. He was offended by two assumptions
behind the job-switching plan: that there was something bad
about being a janitor and that there was something good about
being a Harvard Law School professor. It made no difference
to him that Mr. Kennedy claimed to be his advocate. Few
intellectuals, according to my grandfather, could ever speak
for the common man, because few have ever lived his life. (I
never told my grandfather about the Jaguar that Duncan
Kennedy drives to school. I didn't have to.)
   Left-wing intellectuals would have us believe that
material wealth is the only power operating in society. But
the perceived knowledge and prestige that emanate from
academia are a form of power too. The leftism that pervades
universities furtively molds the minds of tomorrow's
citizens. In the same way that society turns to the market to
acquire wealth, society turns to academia to acquire another
putative social good: educational prestige. And as spokesmen
for capitalism are reluctant to concede that wealth confers
power, apologists for academia are reluctant to concede that
educational prestige confers power too. If educational
prestige were as easily transferable as wealth, one wonders
whether academics would be the zealous redistributionists
they are today.
   The fact is that the arguments made by the leftist
professors at places like Harvard Law School are made not so
much for the benefit of the common man as for themselves.
Turgid left-wing theories propounded from ivory towers are
rarely heard in the factories and in the fields, and when
they are heard, they are never understood. These theories are
not published for the common man to read, but to win
notoriety, tenure and chaired professorships from other
academics.
   Lenin quipped that "(w)henever the cause of the people is
entrusted to professors, it is lost." Lenin was as much an
intellectual as the professors he ridiculed, perhaps even
more. That may be why he failed to capture the relationship
between common man and intellectual as well as that more
authentic populist philosopher, Hank Williams Jr.:
                                                                                                       

   You build me up,
   To build you up
   Only to let me down . . .

   Big Developer Says
   It May File Under
   Bankruptcy Law
   ----

   MIAMI -- General Development Corp., already battered by
financial and legal woes, said it may file for federal
bankruptcy-law protection.
   Negotiations for a badly needed $60 million credit
facility broke down over the weekend, General Development
said, leaving it unable to pay certain obligations. One of
Florida's largest developers, General Development couldn't
meet its more than $10 million property tax bill, due last
Sunday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a result, General Development said it is considering
all options, including a bankruptcy filing. A spokesman
wouldn't characterize the likelihood of such a filing or
discuss the other options under consideration.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
company's stock tumbled $1.875 a share, to close at $4.
   A spokesman for General Development wouldn't say why the
three-week-old negotiations had failed. Other parties
involved in the talks were Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, which holds a $75 million General Development note,
and Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., lead
banks in a $175 million revolving credit facility for General
Development.
   Prudential, Chemical Bank and Manufactuers Hanover hadn't
any comment.
   General Development had hoped to use the fresh cash from
the new credit facility to help reverse liquidity problems
resulting from its recent legal troubles. Last month, the
company pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy in a
plea bargain to settle charges that it defrauded some 10,000
homebuyers by charging inflated prices based on improper
appraisals. Its former two top officers also pleaded guilty
to one count of conspiracy.
   A restitution plan, under which General Development
expects to repay homebuyers as much as $100 million over 25
years, capped a two-year grand jury investigation of the
company. As that investigation unfolded, though, General
Development said its cash flow dried up amid the uncertainty
about its future.
   Meanwhile, United Capital Corp., a New York real estate
company which held about 12.6% of General Development last
month, still plans to try to gain control of General
Development's board. Last month, United Capital made a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing, indicating that it
will seek to elect six directors to General Development's
board at the company's annual meeting in May.
   United Capital said it and General Development exchanged
proposals and counterproposals concerning board
representation, management changes and ways United Capital
could help the Miami-based company avoid a bankruptcy-law
filing. But United Capital said the companies couldn't come
to an agreement, and the talks ended.

   NEW YORK -- Unlisted share prices slipped in muted trading
yesterday, depressed by weaker equity markets overseas.
   But the spirits of some shareholders were lifted by a bank
takeover in the New York area.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Home Savings Bank of New York jumped 3 7/8, or more than
25%, to 18 7/8 after agreeing to be acquired by H.F. Ahmanson
for $300 million in stock. Home Savings Bank shareholders
will receive about $25 worth of Ahmanson stock for each of
their shares.
   But investors here awoke to the news that the Nikkei
225-Stock Index plummeted 1,978.4 points, or 6.6%, overnight,
adding to a 3.37% drop in Tokyo's previous session. Stock
prices also fell in European markets.
   "Everything was marked down significantly at the opening
in response to Tokyo and Europe," says George Jennison,
comanager of OTC trading at Wheat First Securities in
Richmond, Va.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index failed to recover from the
early weakness, ending with a loss of 2.36, or 0.54%, to
433.18. Total Nasdaq volume fell to 111.4 million, down 15.2
million shares from 126.6 million shares Friday. The New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index eased 0.41%.
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 662 to 1,321. Meanwhile,
National Market System volume fell to 80,744,400 shares from
Friday's 86,593,000 shares.
   Mr. Jennison says he doesn't expect trading to pick up
until after investors see the string of economic data to be
released this week.
   Scheduled for today are the leading indicators for
February, while on Friday the Labor Department will release
the employment figures for March.
   "I really think that we will have people sitting on the
fence all week," Mr. Jennison says.
   Without increased activity, investors may be reluctant to
buy less-liquid OTC shares, says Jonathan Raclin, senior vice
president of Chicago Corp.
   First Constitution Financial fell 1 3/8 to 6 7/8. The New
Haven thrift holding company said it expects to post a
first-quarter loss after adding $37 million to its loan loss
provision. In addition, its president and chief executive
officer, Walter R. Miller, agreed to resign.
   Brite Voice Systems added 1/8 to 6 3/8. Friday, the
company said it had bought 386,364 of its common shares from
Perry E. Esping, president and chief executive of Business
Records Corp. in Dallas. Brite Voice has about 4.51 million
shares outstanding.
   Digital Sound dropped 1 1/4 to 8 3/4 after estimating that
it earned about 11 cents a share in the first quarter,
compared with 10 cents last quarter and breakeven results for
the first quarter of 1989. The company said it expects sales
in the quarter to have grown about 3% over the fourth quarter
of 1989. Digital Sound went public in late February at $8.50
a share.
   Live Entertainment surged 2 1/2 to 19 1/4. The company
reported today that it earned $1.67 a share in 1989, compared
with net income of $2.15 a share last year. Lisbeth Barron,
vice president of research at S.G. Warburg Securities, says
that when adjusted for non-recurring other income and a
higher number of shares outstanding, the company's operating
net income was up 42% for the year.
   Ms. Barron also notes that Live, a video distributor,
recently bought the video rights to the movie, "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles," which opened to huge crowds this past
weekend. Ms. Barron says that with the 1989 earnings now
released, Wall Street is focusing on Live's 1990 income,
which she estimates will be about $2.50 a share.
   Outlet Communications gained 2 to 21 1/4. The company
earned 49 cents in the fourth quarter, compared with a 37
cent-loss in the year-ago period. The company also said it is
seeking a buyer for a possible merger.
   Eastover dropped 2 to 10. The company reported that its
loss in the fourth quarter widened to 62 cents a share from a
52-cent loss in the quarter last year.

   SASKATOON, Saskatchewan -- Canadian Mining &amp; Energy Corp.,
or Cameco, said it agreed to sell one-third of its wholly
owned Rabbit Lake uranium mine in Saskatchewan to a unit of
Uranerzbergbau G.m.b.H. of West Germany for 160 million
Canadian dollars (US$136.8 million).
   Cameco will use proceeds from the sale, to Uranerz
Exploration &amp; Mining Ltd., to reduce debt to about C$325
million from about C$515 million at year end, said Thomas
Gorman, Cameco vice president, finance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cameco, one of the non-communist world's largest and
lowest-cost uranium producers, is cleaning up its balance
sheet as its owners prepare for an initial public offering of
shares. The governments of Saskatchewan and Canada, which
respectively own 61.5% and 38.5% of Cameco, hoped to proceed
with the issue last year but it was delayed as uranium prices
fell below $10 a pound, or less than one-quarter of their
1979 peak. Mr. Gorman said a modest rebound to $8.80 a pound
in March from $8.70 in February may signal the start of a
long-awaited firming of uranium prices. But he wouldn't
predict when Cameco's public offering will proceed.
   The Uranerz transaction, subject to regulatory approvals
and other conditions, is expected to close by July.
   Rabbit Lake, one of three uranium mines that Cameco
operates in Saskatchewan, has been closed since March 1989,
as the company upgrades its mill in the face of depressed
uranium prices. The mine's assets also include four adjacent
deposits, with reserves, estimated at 177 million pounds at
the end of 1988, expected to be sufficient to continue
operations well beyond 2000. Uranerz already holds a 33.33%
stake in the south zone of one of the four deposits, known as
Eagle North.
   Cameco and Uranerz also are partners at Cameco's Key Lake
uranium mine and at the Star Lake gold project, both in
Saskatchewan.
   Mr. Gorman said that Cameco's recent discovery of an
additional uranium deposit in Saskatchewan "will essentially
replace the reserves that we are selling" to Uranerz, and
that Cameco doesn't anticipate any further asset sales.

<LP>
   Wine importers are nervously awaiting the outcome of an
unusual flap over a fungicide that is widely used on grapes
in Europe but illegal in the U.S.
   The problem surfaced early last month when the Food and
Drug Administration detected residues of the fungicide
procymidone in two samples of Asti Spumante during a routine
check. Since then, the agency has found traces of the
fungicide in 11 of 116 Italian and French shipments,
including Beaujolais wines and more Asti Spumante, as part of
its continuing investigation. Sunday, the FDA announced it
would require some Italian and French vintners to certify
that their wines were free of the procymidone.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The FDA doesn't believe the fungicide is a health threat
at the levels it has detected. But with consumers
increasingly skittish about pesticides and wine consumption
dropping 2% a year, the industry is worried about public
perception.
   "People in the importing business look at this and say it
has the potential to get blown out of proportion," says an
executive at a major U.S. vintner. Although the fungicide
isn't used by domestic vintners, he says all wine makers have
reason to be concerned because the image of wine in general
could be hurt. "This isn't an imports vs. California wines
issue. Something like procymidone affects all wines."
   The procymidone discovery spotlights the problem of
conflicting regulatory standards in different countries for
food additives and pesticides. Some experts question whether
U.S. regulators and marketers are prepared to deal with the
issue of imported food that meets standards in its own
country but that may not meet U.S. regulations.
   "We are going see to more of this -- pesticides that are
violative but not really a health hazard," says Richard
Jackson, who heads up the risk assessment branch of
California's department of health services. "This is a
classic example of the world getting smaller at the same time
our labs are getting better." He adds: "We are going to have
to grapple with the legal issues. Do you condemn a large
amount of food that really presents no health effect?"
   In an era when food imports are soaring, the dispute also
focuses new attention on what critics call the so-called
"circle of poison," pesticides that are banned or
unregistered in the U.S. but not overseas and thus wind up on
America's dinner table. A pending bill sponsored by Sen.
Patrick Leahy would stringently regulate food imports sprayed
with pesticides that are prohibited in the U.S.
   When it comes to wines, the problem isn't limited to
foreign-made pesticides alone. According to a staffer in Sen.
Leahy's office, U.S. chemical companies make some pesticides
for grapes that aren't registered for use here and that are
only exported. These include Dow Chemical Co.'s Gallant,
which is used in France; Dow's Gauntlet, used in Italy, Spain
and France; and Tokuthion, a pesticide used in Australia that
is manufactured in the U.S. by Mobay Chemical, a U.S. unit of
Bayer AG.
   Procymidone is approved for use in most wine-producing
nations of the world and the levels detected by the Food and
Drug Administration fall well within the tolerances of those
countries. But the Environmental Protection Agency has never
determined if the fungicide poses a health hazard. In a
somewhat curious move, procymidone's manufacturer, Sumitomo
Chemical Co. of Japan, didn't bother to petition the EPA to
set acceptable levels for the fungicide on imports.
   "There have never been any residues in wines that reached
the U.S., and it wasn't anticipated that there would be a
problem," a Sumitomo spokesman explains.
   Although Sumitomo still hasn't formally made its petition
to the EPA, the agency has begun its own toxicological
investigation into the fungicide, which causes tumors in
laboratory animals in high doses. But officials believe the
tiny amounts of procymidone found in wine shipments to date,
mostly 0.03 to 0.04 parts per million, won't pose a health
risk.
   However minimal the hazards to consumers, the potential
trade ramifications are huge. Americans buy more than $2
billion of imported wine each year, mostly from Europe. And
unless a political compromise is reached, the threat of
disrupted shipments threatens to go on for about two years,
the time it typically takes the EPA to set residue levels for
pesticides.
   EPA officials are torn between protecting the free flow of
trade, in this case wine, and the public's health. "The Food
and Drug Administration is obviously out there running their
enforcement program and that has potentially large
ramifications for international trade," says Anne Lindsey,
director of the EPA's registration division. "On the other
hand, we can only establish a tolerance {residue level} if we
can reach the conclusion that it will protect the public
health, and that process takes time."
   Although procymidone is approved by the World Health
Organization, some EPA officials privately complain its data
on the fungicide is flawed and inconsistent.
   European Economic Community officials are scrambling
behind the scenes to come up with a political solution. Since
the problem first surfaced, EC representatives have been
shuttling between Brussels and Washington in the hopes of
persuading U.S. government officials to spare procymidone
from a regulatory quagmire. "The EC is seeking some interim
relief pending what they believe will be ultimate approval of
the fungicide," says Robert Maxwell, president of the
National Association of Beverage Importers.
   In the meantime, most wine importers are keeping mum about
the situation in an apparent attempt to distance their own
brands as much as possible from the problem. But some, such
as Seagram Co. have quietly begun doing their own testing for
procymidone and they express anger at Sumitomo's negligence
in not seeking U.S. clearance.
   "The issue is how could a responsible chemical
manufacturer not have taken some action?" fumes a Seagram
spokesman. "That's what's harmful and damaging."
   Michael Aaron, president of Sherry-Lehmann, an upscale
wine shop in Manhattan, puts it this way: "Sumitomo's failure
to register their product with the EPA is the equivalent of a
vineyard owner bottling his wine and forgetting to put in the
cork."

   Soviet Leaders Split on Economic Goals

   Gorbachev Urges Fast Change;
   Ryzhkov Is Cautious

   MOSCOW -- As the Soviet Union prepares for a new round of
economic reforms, policy makers are split over what measures
should be taken to halt the economy's worrying slide.
   The disagreements pit economists who favor rapid and
radical moves toward a market economy against government
officials who fear this would create unacceptable domestic
upheaval. The outcome could determine the fate of Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, who risks losing control of
economic policy to an increasingly impatient President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The battle is being waged largely behind the scenes. But
in the past few days, the disputes have surfaced in Soviet
newspaper interviews. Most now agree that Mr. Ryzhkov's plans
for gradual transition to a more market-oriented economy,
unveiled in parliament in December, don't go far enough. But
there the consensus ends. Following an unpublished government
decision last month, preparatory work has been speeded up on
about 20 bills and resolutions to be presented to the Soviet
Parliament next month. They include legislation on such key
issues as reforming prices, creating a new banking system and
setting up a securities market.
   But Mr. Gorbachev seems concerned that these measures
won't be decisive enough. Meeting with his new presidential
council of advisers last week, he talked about "radicalizing"
economic reform and said that later this month the council
would discuss a new economic package, an apparent alternative
to the government's.
   In a striking change, Mr. Gorbachev described his goal as
being "a controlled transfer to market relations," dropping
his earlier hedged calls for a "planned-market economy" or a
"socialist market."
   Soviet officials say Mr. Gorbachev's remarks bore the
imprint of two radical economists who have become his
personal advisers: presidential council member Stanislav
Shatalin and outspoken academic Nikolai Petrakov. In an
interview Sunday in the newspaper Trud, Mr. Petrakov called
for creation of "a contemporary, full-blooded market," and
said the present system of economic management was bankrupt.
He didn't mention the prime minister by name, but criticized
Mr. Ryzhkov's earlier plans to stabilize the economy as being
"very indecisive."
   Mr. Petrakov advocates "painful and unpopular measures" to
turn around the economy, including an attack on rising
inflation and the closing of unprofitable enterprises. He
would cushion the blow by borrowing huge sums in the West and
using the money to fill Soviet stores with imported consumer
goods.
   Such a move is vigorously resisted by Mr. Ryzhkov, who
says the Soviet Union has already borrowed enough abroad.
Some of Mr. Petrakov's other suggestions also jar with the
more cautious approach of Mr. Ryzhkov and his advisers. In
the same issue as Mr. Petrakov's comments, Trud printed a
reply by Andrei Orlov, deputy head of the government's
economic reform committee. He warned that hasty moves toward
a market economy could exacerbate social tensions and spark
"an even more serious economic crisis."
   Western diplomats in Moscow believe Mr. Gorbachev's
election as president gives the dispute strong political
overtones. As he struggles to impose his authority, he is
seeking to wrest control of key policy issues from the
Communist Party and the government apparatus. Thus, a
high-level French government delegation visiting Moscow last
week found "everyone is working on their own economic
reforms," says a French diplomat.
   Mr. Gorbachev has already demonstrated his new economic
clout by unexpectedly firing the ministers of health and
civil aviation Friday. Both ministers were appointed by the
Parliament last summer on Mr. Ryzhkov's recommendation.
   One of the clearest areas of disagreement among policy
makers is over the crucial issue of reforming the Soviet
Union's topsy-turvy pricing system. Prices are currently
fixed by government authorities and some haven't changed for
decades. The result is that the government is forced to spend
about $160 billion in subsidies on food and some consumer
goods annually, while the cost of many industrial goods is
far higher than in the West.
   Breaking the structure and allowing prices to reflect
supply and demand has been the government's aim since Mr.
Gorbachev unveiled his initial economic reform program in
1987. But so far, the Kremlin has lacked the courage to go
ahead with the change, fearing price rises could exacerbate
growing social tension.
   The issue is now apparently back on the agenda, but there
is disagreement over how the reform should be handled, and
how quickly. Vyacheslav Senchagov, head of the State
Committee on Prices, said last week that three options are
now being considered. The first would involve an average
20%-30% increase in wholesale and retail prices, ending
subsidies and devaluing the ruble by about 50% against
Western currencies. The second option would involve copying
Poland's "shock therapy," tripling oil and coal prices to
bring them to world market levels and moving rapidly toward a
convertible ruble. This would risk an initial big surge in
inflation and high unemployment in the hope of forcing market
mechanisms to start working. The third version would be a
more timid interim move, allowing some prices to float, but
continuing to fix many others.
   The third version seems to have government support,
although it is uncertain how effective it would be. Mr. Orlov
indicated to Trud that he clearly favored this variant, and
insisted that price reform won't take place before 1991.
   But some radicals can't wait that long, and the latest
economic news has strengthened their calls for measures more
akin to Poland's. According to preliminary figures, the
Soviet Union is in a deep recession. Production dropped by
about 1% in the first two months of 1990 before adjustment
for inflation, which is estimated at between 7% and 17%. The
only part of the economy to show a substantial increase was
alcohol production, which jumped almost 12% after the
government relaxed its anti-vodka campaign.

   TOKYO -- James M. Walsh, chairman of CS First Boston
Inc.'s Japan subsidiary, resigned, six weeks after the
company appointed another investment banker to run the
group's Asian operations.
   Neither Mr. Walsh nor CS First Boston would say if his
departure was connected to the appointment in February of
Allen Wheat as chief executive of CS First Boston Pacific
Inc. The appointment of Mr. Wheat, former chairman of Bankers
Trust Co.'s international arm, created a new layer of
management between Mr. Walsh and CS First Boston's executives
in New York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Walsh, contacted in Hawaii, said he decided to leave
CS First Boston after the firm asked him to move to London.
"I wanted to stay in Japan, so I pulled the ripcord," he
said. "The decision to leave was entirely my own choice."
   He declined to discuss his resignation further.
   A 14-year veteran of CS First Boston and its corporate
predecessor, First Boston Inc., Mr. Walsh was largely
responsible for building up the group in Japan. Since the
firm opened a branch here in 1985, its staff has swelled from
12 people to more than 400, with offices in Tokyo and Osaka.
   CS First Boston is one of 22 foreign members of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, and also belongs to the Tokyo International
Financial Futures Exchange.

   Oedipus Meets the Muse

<LP>
   Michael Frayn is a prolific English literary polymath, a
fluent professional who has bounced between genres with an
insouciant neglect of the standard hierarchies. His new novel
"The Trick of It" (Viking, 172 pages, $17.95) is his first in
16 years, and the path that led him to it is most unusual.
   He was born in 1933 in a London suburb, and after reading
"Moral Sciences" (philosophy) at Cambridge became a reporter
and columnist on the Guardian and then the Observer from 1957
to 1968. In the mid-1960s he published no less than four
collections of satirical pieces with titles like "Never Put
Off to Gomorrah" and "Pas Devant les Enfants," which contain
such "apercus" as "a child is rather like a television set,
in fact -- and turning the sound down when company comes
isn't enough to prevent all eyes in the room from being
irresistibly drawn towards it."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But while turning out his columns, and features on Cuba,
Israel, Japan and Sweden, and TV plays and documentaries on
Berlin, Vienna and Australia, Mr. Frayn was also writing
novels in a happy exploratory way. His first, "The Tin Men,"
a social satire of the TV and computer age, came out in 1965.
Over the next eight years he published "The Russian
Interpreter" (about Moscow literary smuggling), "Against
Entropy" (a Fleet Street satire), "A Very Private Life" (a
dystopian moral fable about a drug- and TV-saturated fascist
future not unlike those of "1984" and "A Clockwork Orange")
and "Sweet Dreams" (a satirical fantasy about the banal
afterlife of a banal London milquetoast).
   Energetic and varied indeed, but there's more. A book of
pensees and obiter dicta called "Constructions" came out in
1974. Translations of Tolstoy and Chekhov started to appear
at the end of the decade. And all the while -- from 1970 on
-- Mr. Frayn was also becoming a Major Contemporary English
Playwright, the author of nine plays about provincial
newspapers, Cambridge college reunions, Frankfurt trade
fairs, journalists in Cuba, urban renewal and friendships,
and -- most conspicuously -- a farce about farce: "Noises
Off" (1982), in which a touring theatrical company doing a
dreadful British Sex Comedy (called "Nothing On") comes apart
at the seams in midperformance. Life imitates art imitating
life, and whirl is king.
   Mr. Frayn has now returned to the novel with a new energy
and ventriloquistic control. "The Trick of It" is composed of
a series of letters from an English academic hack -- a
32-year-old provincial professor of modern lit -- to a former
colleague now in Australia. These letters narrate his
conquest and command of his subject: a 44-year-old English
lady novelist (a mix of Iris Murdoch and Doris Lessing) whom
he's been studying and lecturing on for a dozen years. He
invites her to his campus, he inserts himself into her bed,
he lurks about her life in London, he makes himself useful
and finally marries her.
   Whereupon he removes her from London to a suburb of his
grim campus town and attempts to reshape her latest novel,
turning her unfashionable moral seriousness into his
deconstructive "ludic" trickery (she needs "some sense of
detachment, of ironic self-awareness"). When she resists his
critical meddling and becomes fascinated with his elderly
relatives, his resentment grows, and he moves himself and his
wife to the University of Abu Dhabi, in the midst of a
desert. But even there "she's fecund; I'm not." While she's
busy writing a new novel about the mother he neglected back
in England, he fails to write anything more than envious,
self-serving letters. He can't fence her imagination in, and
he can't escape the vicious circle of his own barren
narcissism.
   This kind of unreliable, vain narrator whom we delight in
seeing through, even as we enjoy his mobile wit, comes in
many shapes and colors: Henry James and Nabokov excelled in
virtuosic variations on the literary life, and Mr. Frayn's
wretch is a late descendant of James's "publishing scoundrel"
in "The Aspern Papers." What Mr. Frayn has done is to turn up
the comic volume, using his dramatic skills to give us a
voice that resonates with the rich self-love of a redbrick
Malvolio:
   "I know her mind and I know her heart, and I know them
backwards, forwards and sideways. I know them better than she
knows them herself. . . . These soft bulges beneath my hand
were not just parts of a woman -- they were bits of an
author, of (as I believe) a very fine author, just possibly
of a great author -- of an author whose works I had been
reading and studying and expounding for the past twelve
years]"
   He concedes he is violating the "taboo against intercourse
with an author on your own reading-list" but is quick to note
that her underwear doesn't match (pink bra, white panties):
"I was deeply shocked by this appalling solecism, it's true.
But then I was moved by the artlessness of it. Suddenly she
seemed hopelessly vulnerable, and of course at once I became
wild to storm these melting walls. So then I triumphed in my
pleasure and conquest. . . . This was a revenge for all those
long years when she had been up there, oblivious of me, and I
had been down here gazing so intently up at her."
   Ever witty and self-deceived, our narrator gnashes his
teeth at the ways the artist simply won't submit to his
control -- anymore than a mother will submit to the control
of her four-year-old would-be incestuous son. So in this
novel of literature and criticism, older woman and younger
man, Mr. Frayn has confected a comic variation on some
classic themes: Oedipus meets the Muse, and she escapes.

   FBI Staff Found Too Small for S&amp;L Cases

   The House Government Operations commerce subcommittee says
the Federal Bureau of Investigation lacks sufficient agents
to investigate savings-and-loan fraud.
   Accusing the Bush administration of failing to match its
rhetoric with manpower, the subcommittee is relying on an
authoritative source: an FBI study.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Doug Barnard (D., Ga.), chairman of the House panel,
has asked the House Appropriations Committee to allocate $75
million for S&amp;L enforcement for fiscal 1991, which begins
Oct. 1. The administration has requested $50 million.
   In a study of 59 field offices last year, the FBI
concluded it needed 425 new agents to begin work on some
2,300 "inactive," or unaddressed, fraud and embezzlement
cases involving savings and loans. In December, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh announced the deployment of 202
agents -- less than half of what the FBI wanted.
   "It just looks like there isn't a serious-enough effort in
the Justice Department," said Mr. Barnard. The allocation he
requested includes money for additional federal prosecutors,
which Mr. Barnard contends are also badly needed.
   In testimony before the committee, Edward Dennis Jr.,
chief of the Justice Department's criminal division,
responded testily to Mr. Barnard's call for more agents and
prosecutors. He conceded, however, that "numerous districts
have a significant unaddressed backlog" of S&amp;L cases.
   Thomas Jones, the FBI's chief of white-collar crime
investigations, said that staffing decisions were made
jointly with the Justice Department. "We can always use more
people; the more we have, certainly the better job we can
do," he said.
   An Appropriations Committee staff member observed that the
administration is "primarily focused, as is Congress, on
drugs. Getting them to focus on bank fraud is going to take
some time."
   Meanwhile, S&amp;L fraud cases, which burgeoned in the 1980s
after the Reagan administration deregulated the industry,
continue to increase. The reason: As regulators close more
failed S&amp;Ls, they frequently uncover criminal allegations and
refer the cases to the Justice Department.

   MANUEL NORIEGA'S LAWYERS put the U.S. invasion of Panama
on trial.
   At a hearing in U.S. district court in Miami, attorneys
for the deposed Panamanian dictator argued that the U.S.
invasion of Panama was so outrageous that drug-racketeering
charges against him must be dismissed.
   Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general and
human-rights activist, was subpoenaed by the defense and
testified that obtaining an accurate death count in Panama
has proven impossible. However, he said, some estimates range
from 3,000 to 6,000 dead.
   Mr. Clark recalled that during a fact-finding visit he
made to Panama in January shortly after the invasion, he
learned of "a great deal of death and destruction." He said a
child playing in a cemetery led him to a mass grave, and an
independent human-rights commission heard testimony of
incidents in which body bags were packed with several corpses
each.
   Frank Rubino, one of Mr. Noriega's attorneys, played a
videotape assembled from television news footage that
detailed the death and destruction.
   But a key witness that Noriega's attorneys had hoped to
call wasn't in court yesterday. Prosecutors persuaded U.S.
District Judge William M. Hoeveler to quash a defense
subpoena for Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. Mr. Rubino said he had hoped to extract testimony from
the military chief about the invasion and to compel him to
produce documents detailing U.S. pre-invasion estimates of
casualties and the sophisticated weaponry used.
   Federal courts have held that the way a defendant is
apprehended is irrelevant to a court's jurisdiction and right
to try him. However, Mr. Noriega's lawyers argue the Noriega
case is unique and the U.S. government's conduct in Panama is
so "immoral and illegal" that the charges have to be thrown
out. The defense lawyers implored Judge Hoeveler to "tread
new territory" and "go where no man has ever gone before."
   Mr. Rubino cited several cases, including that of
Francisco Toscanino, a federal drug defendant who claimed he
was beaten and abducted in Uruguay, tortured in Brazil by his
captors, and spirited to the U.S. to stand trial. The Second
Circuit Court of Appeals said that if Mr. Toscanino's claims,
including alleged U.S. involvement in his ordeal, were true,
they were so shocking to the court's conscience that Mr.
Toscanino had to be freed.
   Judge Hoeveler hasn't yet ruled on whether to hold an
evidentiary hearing on the issue of the invasion. Federal
prosecutors contend that no such hearing is necessary.
   They note, among other things, that even if the assertions
about the brutality are true -- which they dispute -- the
case against Mr. Noriega can proceed.

   CALIFORNIA COURT RULES that a Nomura unit can arbitrate
age-bias claim.
   Employers contend arbitration is more efficient and less
costly than court trials for employment-discrimination cases.
However, some plaintiffs' lawyers argue that employers simply
are trying to avoid the big damage verdicts that juries
sometimes hand out in wrongful termination and other job-bias
cases.
   In this case, J. Robert Hall, a 60-year-old stockbroker in
Nomura Securities International's San Francisco office, had
sued the firm in state court, claiming he was fired because
of his age and previous medical problems. Nomura is a unit of
Japan's Nomura Securities Co. The suit was brought under a
California statute barring job discrimination because of age
or physical handicap.
   However a state appeals court in San Francisco agreed with
Nomura's contention that Mr. Hall was bound by an arbitration
provision in his employment contract and by New York Stock
Exchange rules requiring arbitration of employment disputes.
Citing federal legislation favoring arbitration agreements,
the court last week rejected Mr. Hall's contention that he
wasn't bound by the contractual clause because his claim was
brought under state law.
   Robert A. Dolinko, an attorney in the San Franciso office
of Epstein Becker Stromberg &amp; Green, counsel for Nomura,
termed the ruling "significant," saying it's the first time a
California appeals court has compelled arbitration of an
employment-discrimination claim under such circumstances.
   James Paul Green, a San Francisco attorney who represented
Mr. Hall, said he will appeal the ruling. "We are not pleased
with the decision, to put it quietly," he said.

   QUICK ACTION UNLIKELY on key proposals of a federal-courts
study panel.
   The Federal Courts Study Committee, authorized by Congress
and appointed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, yesterday
issued more than 100 recommendations after 15 months of
debate. But the proposals will get a mixed reception,
according to lawmakers and congressional aides.
   The quickest action is likely to be on legislation
carrying as many as two dozen "technical" proposals, such as
eliminating a special court created in 1971 to handle cases
arising from oil and gas price controls, or allowing parties
in civil suits to agree to have their case heard by a
magistrate. This "housekeeping" bill, as one congressional
aide called it, will be worked out in meetings among the four
legislators who were part of the 15-member panel: Sen. Howell
Heflin (D., Ala.), Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), Rep.
Robert Kastenmeier (D., Wis.), and Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R.,
Calif.).
   Another possibility for action this year, although far
more controversial, is legislation creating more federal
judgeships. Two years ago, the federal courts asked for some
75 additional slots, and the need is now closer to 100. No
bills have been introduced yet, and proposals for more
judgeships typically involve much partisan negotiation among
Democrats and Republicans.
   Other proposals may languish for some time. Among the
controversial proposals are putting all tax appeals in a
special tax court; eliminating from the federal courts suits
between citizens of different states over state law issues;
abolishing mandatory minimum prison sentences passed by
Congress in some recent criminal laws; and limiting the kinds
of drug prosecutions that may be filed in federal court, in
order to keep more cases in state court.
   The study committee watered down its earlier call, in a
draft, for Congress to abolish the Sentencing Commission and
the federal criminal sentencing guidelines it issued, to
which many federal judges object.
   The study committee went out of existence yesterday after
issuing the report at a Supreme Court ceremony.
   But the committee's director, William Slate, is expected
to set up a lobbying effort for the proposals through a
Washington nonprofit group called the Council for Court
Excellence.

   ARBITRATION GROUP takes alternative dispute resolution to
Eastern Europe.
   East Germany's Chamber of Foreign Trade and its Court of
Arbitration have agreed to recommend the use of American
Arbitration Association techniques to help resolve disputes
betweem U.S. and East German businesses. The Austrian Federal
Economic Chamber has agreed to allow Vienna to serve as a
neutral site for resolving those contract disputes.
   AAA President Robert Coulson says U.S. companies had
pushed for the neutral site, because they were leery of the
existing East German arbitration system that is dominated by
government personnel. Mr. Coulson added that the
association's role is to promote these kinds of agreements
and then to educate foreign arbitrators about American
dispute resolution.
   Already, similar agreements are in effect with chambers of
commerce of Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the
Soviet Union.

   ANTI-MARCOS PROTESTERS plan to greet Imelda Marcos at
court today.
   Opening arguments are slated in her racketeering case in
Manhattan federal court. Opponents of Mrs. Marcos and her
late husband, Ferdinand, the ousted president of the
Philippines, kept a low profile during jury selection for the
case; they feared they would be accused of trying to sway
prospective jurors.
   Filipinos opposing the 20-year Marcos regime began
soliciting volunteers at the Philippines consulate in
Manhattan last week during a forum on the trial. Fliers were
circulated asking people to help monitor the case and
demonstrate at the courthouse.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of stealing more than $160 million
from the Philippines and illegally concealing most of the
money through real-estate investments in Manhattan.

   Punitive Damages May Be Facing

SUPREME COURT (SUP)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, in a case that may be a
vehicle for a ruling on the constitutionality of punitive
damages, agreed to review a $1.1 million verdict against
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co.
   An Alabama jury in 1987 awarded $1,077,978 in compensatory
and punitive damages to four municipal employees of Roosevelt
City, Ala., for fraud by a Pacific Mutual agent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The four paid premiums to the city to provide them with
life and health insurance. Beginning in 1981, the city bought
policies from an agent who worked for Pacific Mutual, a
Newport Beach, Calif., company. The life insurance was issued
through Pacific Mutual, but the health policy was from
another, unrelated company which the Pacific Mutual agent
also represented -- Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co. of
Trevose, Pa., an AON Corp. unit.
   The agent arranged to have all correspondence with Union
Fidelity sent to his Pacific Mutual office in Birmingham,
Ala., rather than to the city. The four Roosevelt City
workers alleged in their lawsuit that the agent didn't
forward their premium payments to Union Fidelity. Union
Fidelity canceled the policy a few months after it began, but
the notices weren't sent to the city or the employees.
   Only when one of the four employees incurred $2,500 in
hospital bills in January 1982 did they discover that they
were no longer insured. They sued the agent and Pacific
Mutual, as his employer. The jury, holding the company liable
for its agent's actions, awarded a $1.1 million verdict
against Pacific Mutual. The verdict was upheld by the Alabama
Supreme Court last September.
   Appealing to the high court, the insurance company
challenged the constitutionality of punitive damage awards.
The high court ruled last year that large punitive awards
don't violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of "excessive
fines." But the justices left open the question of whether
such awards, issued with few limits on a jury, violate the
14th Amendment guarantee of "due process."
   But while the high court agreed to hear the appeal, which
raises the "due process" issue, the case appears to be a
dubious vehicle for such a ruling. In its verdict, the
Alabama jury lumped the damages together, making it unclear
how much of the award is compensatory and how much is
punitive.
   It is possible the court will address only the narrower
question of whether a company may be held liable for punitive
damages when the actions were taken by a subordinate
employee, rather than by the company itself. (Pacific Mutual
Life Insurance Co. vs. Haslip)
                                                                                                       

   Airbag Lawsuits
                                                                                                       

   Without comment, the justices let stand four rulings by
state and federal appeals courts that people injured in car
accidents can't sue the vehicle manufacturers for failing to
install airbags. The high court declined to hear appeals in
three lawsuits against General Motors Corp., one of which
also named Honda Motor Co.'s U.S. subsidiary, and in one
lawsuit against Nissan Motor Co.'s U.S. subsidiary.
   All of the cases involved the issue of whether the 1966
federal motor safety law or safety standards issued by the
Transportation Department were intended to bar manufacturers'
liability under state law for lawsuits alleging that vehicles
were unsafe because they lacked airbags. The latest safety
standard, issued in 1984, required manufacturers to phase in
passive restraints, either airbags or automatic seatbelts, in
new cars by the 1990-model year.
   Denial of the four appeals may not settle the issue of
whether such lawsuits under state personal injury laws are
pre-empted, however. Thus far, all appeals courts that have
addressed the issue have ruled that federal law pre-empts
state personal injury claims. If a state or federal appeals
court reaches the opposite result in the future, that will
make new high court appeals likely.
   All four cases were filed by injured people or the
families of people killed in car accidents between 1981 and
1985. (Wood vs. General Motors Corp.; Kitts vs. General
Motors Corp.; Taylor vs. General Motors Corp.; Meier vs.
Nissan Motor Corp.)
                                                                                                       

   California Death Penalty
                                                                                                       

   The high court, by a 6-3 vote, refused to clear the way
for the first execution in California in 23 years. A federal
appeals court judge in San Francisco last Friday stayed the
execution of Robert Harris, which was scheduled for today.
California Attorney General John Van de Kamp appealed to the
Supreme Court, asking that the state be allowed to send Mr.
Harris to the gas chamber. But the high court refused, over
the dissenting votes of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. Mr. Harris's
appeal now will be heard by a three-judge appeals court
panel.

   First Executive Posts a 4th-Quarter Loss
   Of $835.7 Million; SEC Probe Disclosed

   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp., sharply boosting
charges against its giant junk-bond portfolio, reported an
$835.7 million fourth-quarter loss and disclosed that policy
surrenders totaled $559 million in January and February this
year.
   The wounded insurance holding company also said that the
Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a formal
investigation of possible securities violations by the
company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its annual report, First Executive said California
regulators have compelled the company's principal unit,
Executive Life Insurance Co., to refrain from junk bond
purchases and any major transactions with affiliates without
the prior approval of regulators.
   Despite higher reserves than earlier announced for
potential bond portfolio losses, First Executive said the
approximate market value of its fixed-maturities investments
remains about $1.5 billion below the $15.27 billion book
value.
   With year-end assets of $19.2 billion, Los Angeles-based
First Executive is one of the nation's larger insurance
companies. The company was for many years one of the largest
purchasers of junk bonds from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
now in bankruptcy proceedings.
   In recent months, First Executive's financial woes have
widened, prompting a plunge in the company stock and a
torrent of surrenders from policy holders. Yesterday, in
national over-the-counter trading, First Executive common
closed unchanged at $2.75 a share on volume of 961,500
shares.
   The $559 million of surrenders reported for the first two
months of the year was substantially lower than some
analysts' had speculated. However, the closely watched pace
of those surrenders was almost treble last year's
already-accelerated $1.3 billion in policy returns.
   Just as troubled banks can be strained by a surge in
withdrawals, demands for policy returns pose substantial
burdens on insurance companies. First Executive said it has
been "encouraged" lately by a decline in surrender requests.
Also, analysts have been told that telephone calls seeking
information about how to surrender policies have declined.
However, the company warned that its announcements may
reverse that favorable trend.
   First Executive said it believes it has sufficient
liquidity to weather current spates of policy surrenders. At
March 23, cash and short-term investments totaled about $2.5
billion, up from $2 billion at year end, the company said.
   At the root of the company's larger-than-expected loss was
a surprising $344 million increase in the charge taken for
prospective bond losses. In January, First Executive said it
expected to take a $515 million one-time charge, net of
taxes, to clean up the portfolio. However, with the increase,
that charge totals $859 million.
   Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief executive
officer, attributed the increase to "further turmoil" in the
junk-bond market after the company's January calculations.
   With the charge, First Executive's fourth-quarter net loss
totaled $835.7 million, or a loss of $9.98 a share, compared
with net income of $48.2 million, or 42 cents a share, a year
earlier. Counting realized securities losses of $1.06 billion
in the latest quarter, revenue was a negative $540.5 million,
compared with $552.4 million the year earlier.
   The latest quarter's results brought losses for the year
to $775.6 million, or $9.67 a share, compared with net income
a year earlier of $174.5 million, or $1.51 a share. Revenue,
including realized securities losses of $1.06 billion, was
$1.19 billion last year compared with $2.14 billion a year
earlier. All results for 1988 have been restated to reflect
accounting changes.
   First Executive noted that the newly widened charges for
bond losses in its publicly-reported numbers, based on
generally-accepted accounting principles, don't require
changes in recently reported year-end results to regulators.
They are calculated on very different, statutory assumptions.
   The SEC's investigation, titled "In the Matter of First
Executive," was opened last month, according to the company,
and deals with possible violations of securities laws since
June 1988, when First Executive announced plans for a $284
million rights offering. The company said it was cooperating
with the investigation, which supercedes an "informal" probe
begun in January.
   A company official declined to elaborate on the
investigation. However, it is believed to focus on questions
of timely disclosure of material information, the absence of
which may have induced stock purchases at inflated prices.
   Stock was sold in the rights sale at $15 a share in
October. Within three months, First Executive disclosed its
$515 million write-down and other woes. A number of civil
suits have been launched alleging securities violations
related to the rights offering. The company has said its
disclosure was timely and accurate.
   Other investigations also were disclosed, among them
inquiries by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and
the Labor Department into the issue of annuities by Executive
Life related to pension terminations. The company's business
in this area was the subject of a page one article in this
newspaper.
   First Executive's disclosure of strictures by California
regulators suggests closer controls over its Executive Life
unit than previously indicated. California's Department of
Insurance has placed permanent observers at the company.
   Now, however, all new transactions with affiliates in
amounts exceeding 2% of Executive Life's capital and surplus
must be approved in advance by regulators. At Dec. 31,
Executive Life Insurance Co. had capital and surplus totaling
$459.2 million, indicating that regulators require prior
approval of transactions of more than about $9 million.
   Other factors also are impinging on First Executive. The
company said it obtained a waiver from banks for what may
have been a technical default on about $275 million of debt.
The prospective default involved the company's recent
repurchase of about $7.3 million of stock following its
fourth-quarter loss.
   First Executive said it plans to seek an amendment to
convenants that would permit it to pay cash dividends and
repurchase stock in cases that aren't currently permitted.
The company has never paid a cash dividend and now is barred
from doing so under debt covenants.

   Bad news for Washington, if not the Republic: There's
evidence that for most American kids, Washington is history.
A report just out by the National Assessment of Educational
Progress says only about one-third of polled eighth graders
know that Congress makes the laws or could identify the
presidential veto. About half know that the U.S. is a
representative democracy or understand the separation of
powers. Still, there may be reasons for these results.
   Maybe they'd be better able to recognize their government
if someone asked them what a $500 billion omnibus
appropriation bill was. Or a continuing resolution. Most kids
in grade school probably think local judges make the nation's
laws. How is a 13-year-old supposed to know what a
presidential veto is if nobody's spotted more than one or two
since 1974? As to the U.S. being a representative democracy,
is this question related to the 99% re-election rate in the
House of Representatives? The reason some of their parents
don't vote is that increasing numbers of Members have no
opponent in the general election.
</LP>

   We do wonder about one thing, though. If 33% know that
Congress makes laws, what does the other 66% think Congress
does?

   We are tempted beyond endurance, so we hereby
enthusiastically cheer passage of Pennsylvania's proposed
anti-takeover, anti-proxy bill. It is indeed an awful piece
of legislation. Just yesterday, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden
warned that Pennsylvania's bill would "shield management from
investor oversight," and he threatened to use federal laws to
invalidate parts of the bill. Nonetheless, in the interest of
financial science, we say bring it on.
   There is nothing like federalism's 50 petrie dishes to
show which state corporate laws attract capital and jobs and
which spook investors and handicap local economies.
Pennsylvania is about to make the ultimate sacrifice on
behalf of this knowledge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the moment, it looks as if managers of companies
incorporated in Pennsylvania -- fourth among the Fortune 500
-- will get full defenses against any market or stockholder
pressures. The bill speeding through the legislature this
week would disgorge the profit from a stockholder who sells
within 18 months of launching any kind of bid for the
company. This is pure expropriation.
   Moreover, instead of the ancient duty to maximize share
price, directors fighting off bids could consider the
interests of "stakeholders" (employees, suppliers and the
like) above the interests of stockholders. Fiduciary duty,
RIP.
   The most extraordinary feature of the bill is that it
would even make proxy contests, which are always difficult,
prohibitively expensive. The bill says that anyone -- except
managers -- who initiates a proxy must be prepared to buy the
company at a price set by a judge. This provision applies
even if the proxy is not to take over the company but only,
say, to change accounting firms. Any stockholder who launches
a proxy and solicits 20% of the votes would have to tender
for all shares.
   You might wonder why the country's most radical
anti-takeover bill comes during a lull in the takeover
battles and the problems in the junk-bond market. The
explanation -- as with nearly all the prior state legislation
-- is that this bill is to benefit one particular firm
against an out-of-state bidder. Here, Pennsylvania's
Armstrong World Industries has been eyed by the Belzberg
family of Canada.
   Not everyone is happy with the prospect of corporate
protectionism and permanently entrenched managers becoming a
way of life in the Keystone state. The head of investing for
Pennsylvania's own $9.6 billion State Employees' Retirement
System says that if the bill passes he'll oppose any more
investments in companies incorporated in the state. "I could
not invest another penny in them because of my legal duties
to present and future retirees," Kenneth Mertz told state
legislators. "We should not have a law that prevents me from
investing our retirement funds in Pennsylvania companies --
money that belongs to Pennsylvanians."
   Opponents of the bill point to a letter from a regional
office of the Federal Trade Commission and its Bureau of
Economics. It notes that studies by the SEC and others have
shown that share prices fall after enactment of state
anti-takeover bills. Share prices dropped by 1% in New York,
2% in Ohio and between 4% and 6% in Indiana. Prices seem to
fall in proportion to the severity of the legislation, so
Pennsylvania shares could tumble even more.
   But as we say, Pennsylvania is perfectly free to pass any
legislation it likes now that the Supreme Court has chosen
not to invalidate these laws. As social experiments go, we
can't think of many more important than determining the costs
of draconian legal barriers to takeovers and proxy battles.
To this end, Pennsylvania is about to enact a very bad bill.

   Trammell Crow
   Big Refinancing
   Is Completed

   DALLAS -- Trammell Crow Co., as part of an ongoing
restructuring of its debt and operations, completed a $456
million refinancing deal with Equitable Real Estate
Management Inc.
   While the deal is well shy of the $600 million that
Trammell Crow originally sought from Equitable Real Estate,
it will enable the giant real estate developer to cut the
interest it pays on the debt by almost 2.5 percentage points,
while injecting badly needed cash into poorly performing
projects in the Southwest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bulk of the financing will be used to pay off existing
debt on about 90 Trammell Crow properties, which will be
pledged as collateral for the new debt. About $90 million in
remaining cash will be used to pay down Trammell Crow's debt
on another 60 properties that have been unprofitable,
according to Robert Whitman, chief financial officer for
Trammell Crow.
   When the company first approached Equitable Real Estate
about a year ago, it had hoped to clear about $113 million in
cash to pay down the debt on 100 ailing projects. Mr. Whitman
said that list was pared to 60 through the sales of some
properties and improvements in market conditions. Other
properties were rejected by Equitable Real Estate because of
environmental problems, and still others were mortgaged by
lenders who were unwilling to accept an early pay down, Mr.
Whitman said.
   The refinancing with Equitable Real Estate will enable
Trammell Crow to reduce its interest rates from 11.3% to
about 8.8%, Mr. Whitman said. The deal will also put about
10% of Trammell Crow's Southwest projects in the hands of a
single lender and one that has financed Crow projects since
the early 1950s.
   The properties involved in the Equitable deal were
originally financed by some 30 lenders, many of whom are now
feeling pressure from federal regulators to reduce their
exposure to real estate losses. And the stock market added
pressure of its own in early March, when rumors of loan
defaults by Trammell Crow drove down stock prices of some
large bank holding companies.
   Equitable Real Estate President Douglas A. Tibbetts said
the pressures didn't shake his company's commitment to the
refinancing.
   "Despite the rumors that came out recently, we maintained
our comfort level," he said.
   The financing is being provided by the general account of
Equitable Real Estate's parent, Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the U.S., and is the second large refinancing hat
the company has done for Trammell Crow. In 1987, Equitable
Real Estate refinanced the Dallas Market Center for $450
million.
   The properties covered by the current refinancing are
predominately in Texas, Arizona and Colorado, and 70% of them
are industrial or warehouse buildings. About 20% of the
properties are retail centers and the remainder is made up of
office buildings.
   The properties involved in the deal represent about 3% of
Trammell Crow's national holdings of about $15 billion in
real estate. The company ranks as the nation's largest
residential builder and second largest commercial builder.

   New York -- A trio of amiable comedies has opened
off-Broadway over the past few weeks, and none is as charming
as Craig Lucas's whimsical love story "Prelude to a Kiss."
   The plot draws from that satisfying structure of the film
romances of the '30s and '40s: Boy gets girl, boy loses girl,
boy regains girl. Peter (Alec Baldwin) and Rita (Mary-Louise
Parker) are made for each other and they know it, with that
captivating self-assurance that accompanies love at first
sight.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The spell is cast from the moment they -- and we -- meet
at a raucous Manhattan party, which throbs on around them as
they tentatively flirt with each other. Love may make fools
of every mortal, but Mr. Lucas's humor is never foolish. It
is wise to the ways of love, and pokes gentle fun at Peter
and Rita as they zestfully pursue each other. Theirs is a
whirlwind romance, and the scenes chronicling their courtship
proceed just as fast and furiously; before Act I is over,
Rita and Peter are married.
   Or are they? Peter is convinced that the compliant woman
with him isn't the perky Rita he loves. He's right. This is
more than just the nervous delusion of a man having second
thoughts about marriage. During the wedding, an elderly
gate-crasher (Barnard Hughes) has kissed the bride and
exchanged souls with her. And so the sweet humor of Act I
gives way to nuttier comedy in the second half as Peter, who
is determined to get "Rita" back, devises a scheme with the
old man, possessed by Rita's spirit, to accomplish that task.
   Mr. Baldwin, "The Hunt for Red October's" younger
heartthrob, displays an appealing vulnerability as the ardent
lover and then the determined husband. Ms. Parker makes a
sexy, sassy Rita, a character whose charm becomes even more
beguiling when locked in the portly, mustachioed body of Mr.
Hughes.
   Director Norman Rene, Mr. Lucas's usual collaborator,
keeps the show going at a gallop. In lieu of elaborate sets,
Mr. Rene decorates the stage with an assortment of silent
extras who help set the mood. In the party scene where Peter
and Rita meet, for example, a -- shall we say? -- amorous
couple is rolling around on the floor. In the bar where Rita
works, a transvestite lurks in the background. What little
scenery there is slides efficiently in and out of the wings.
   "Prelude to a Kiss," now at the Circle Rep, is the
38-year-old Mr. Lucas's eighth play and possibly his biggest
hit. It moves to Broadway May 1. Ms. Parker and Mr. Hughes
are going along, but Timothy Hutton will replace Mr. Baldwin.
   ---
   If "Prelude to a Kiss" celebrates fools for love, fools in
a half-dozen other guises are toasted in "Feast of Fools,"
Geoff Hoyle's one-man show at the Westside Arts Theater.
"Does not the Fool turn the world upside down?" Mr. Hoyle
asks during the prologue. The answer is a happy yes -- and in
the fine-tuned mayhem of "Feast," which Mr. Hoyle also wrote,
it is glorious chaos.
   The title comes from a medieval French New Year's
tradition in which, for one day, the bishop turned his
cathedral over to a fool and the sacred gave way to the
profane. It's the medieval equivalent of letting Eddie Murphy
loose in the White House for 24 hours. Mr. Hoyle re-enacts
the 12th-century spoof with a gleeful vulgarity, employing a
chair as a recalcitrant donkey and making the obvious joke
with a salami.
   Of the eight skits, the two funniest are in mime. The
first, which ends Act I, is about two waiters -- one an
obsequious snob and the other a lackadaisical slob. Mr. Hoyle
hams up both parts to the hilt, disappearing behind one side
of a screen with his nose in the air and a crisp snap of the
napkin over his forearm and reappearing on the other side
with shuffle and a slump. Timing is everything. The
Jekyll-and-Hyde transformations keep getting faster and
faster until finally the waiters are chasing themselves
around the screen and Mr. Hoyle is changing character every
couple of seconds.
   My other favorite is the vaudevillian skit that concludes
the show. Mr. Hoyle, dressed as a nerd -- in horn-rimmed
glasses, baggy pants and an absolutely straight face --
throws himself into a spirited fox trot -- on all three of
his legs. His merry triple-legged four-step is a hoot.
   Mr. Hoyle, an expatriate Englishman who makes his home in
San Francisco, has performed extensively in the Bay area and
at Lincoln Center's Serious Fun] Festival. He writes in a
program note that in "Feast" he has attempted "a selective
exploration and celebration of the Western European branch of
the Fool's family." Huh? That's just a fancy-schmanzy way of
explaining that good jokes never die.
   ---
   Speaking of old jokes, the Manhattan Theater Club has
revived Terrence McNally's 1973 "Bad Habits." It's a pair of
one-acters about two very different sanitariums, one run on
bacchanalian principles, the other dedicated to a Hitlerian
school of therapy.
   With its gags about, among other things, S&amp;M,
homosexuality and transvestism, "Bad Habits" must have seemed
a bit naughty to its original audiences. By now, it's all
rather old hat.
   That said, Kate Nelligan displays her comic gifts as a
loud-mouthed, lascivious patient in Act I and a lovesick
Brunhilde of a nurse in Act II. Faith Prince is amusing as,
first, a suburbanite who's trying to cure herself of the urge
to murder her husband, and then as a sex-starved RN. Nathan
Lane, who sparkled last year as a flamboyant opera-loving
queen in Mr. McNally's "The Lisbon Traviata," grows rather
tiresomely campy here as a Dr. Feelgood in Act I and as a
degenerate patient in Act II.
   Since writing "Bad Habits," Mr. McNally has developed into
a comic playwright with serious purpose, as his subsequent
"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune" and "The Lisbon
Traviata" show. He would be better off working on new
material rather than wasting his time tinkering with the more
trivial successes of the past, however jovial. It could
become a bad habit.

   Your Money Matters -- Investment Dartboard:
   Stock-Picker Wins Big by Thinking Small

   Who says small stocks don't do well these days?
   Certainly not Jonathan Steinberg, publisher and editor in
chief of Individual Investor magazine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He won this column's stock-picking contest for March with
a recommendation for American Film Technologies Inc., a
leading colorizer of movies that recently turned profitable.
The price of the company's shares surged 33% during the
month.
   Thanks to that big gain, the contests' investment pros, as
a group, scored a 7.7% advance for the month -- handily
beating both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (up 3%) and a
randomly selected "dartboard portfolio" (down 1%). In 18
monthly outings, the dart throwers have prevailed five times,
and the pros have won 13 times.
   Now Mr. Steinberg is back with another small-company pick:
Image Entertainment Inc., which makes laser video disks.
Never heard of them? You will, Mr. Steinberg declares.
   A laser video disk is to a videotape as a compact disk is
to a phonograph record. With a laser video disk player, film
buffs can enjoy sharper, more vivid pictures. Though there
are only some 400,000 laser disk players in the U.S., Mr.
Steinberg thinks the number will increase rapidly, now that
some sell for less than $500.
   Image Entertainment, based in Chatsworth, Calif., has a
lot to gain, Mr. Steinberg figures. The company makes the
disks, not the players. It has about 60% of the market, he
says, with exclusive rights to distribute more than 1,500
movies.
   Image Entertainment reported sales of just $7.8 million
for the third quarter ended Dec. 31. Its earnings were
smaller yet -- less than a penny a share. But its $109,882
profit for the quarter represents a break into black ink,
after losses during its start-up period. The shares (of which
there are 133 million) sell for about 69 cents apiece, and
Mr. Steinberg recommends buying at any price up to 85 cents
per share.
   Stocks that sell for less than $1 a share -- so-called
penny stocks -- can be highly volatile. And they're often
more expensive to trade than higher-priced stocks. But Mr.
Steinberg doesn't think Image Entertainment is a stock to
trade in and out of: He thinks it's a stock to hold for two
years or more.
   Also back for another try is money manager Remy Fisher, a
vice president with the New York money-management firm J. &amp;
W. Seligman &amp; Co., who is making her third appearance in the
contest. Her recommendation at the end of January to buy
Airborne Freight Corp. is the best pick of the past six
months. Borne aloft by strong earnings, it was up 38% as of
last Friday.
   Ms. Fisher's latest pick is Santa Fe Pacific Corp. She
likes Santa Fe because it is re-emphasizing its railroad
business, selling off portions of its oil and gas, mining and
real estate interests.
   Ms. Fisher says railroads will benefit from a "better
labor-bargaining climate" in the next couple of years. She
especially likes Santa Fe because about a third of the
freight it carries is wheat, and because it emphasizes
"intermodal" (combination road and rail) transportation. She
expects a bumper crop of wheat, and heavy demand for it from
foreign buyers. As for intermodal transport, she says it is
finally becoming cost-competitive with straight trucking.
   Santa Fe should earn $1 a share this year (60 cents of it
from the railroad), Ms. Fisher thinks. For next year she
predicts earnings of $1.75 a share, with the railroad
contributing a full dollar of that.
   Ms. Fisher thinks the operations Santa Fe is shedding have
a value of about $16 a share. The railroad currently has a
value of $15 a share, she reckons, but will grow in value as
results improve. She would buy the stock, which closed
yesterday at $19.25 a share, at prices up to $24.
   Joining the contest this month are two experienced money
managers, Thomas S. Mench of Leshner Financial Services Inc.
in Cincinnati and William Kapner of Justin Asset Management
Inc. in Washington, D.C.
   Mr. Mench, who is a portfolio manager for three mutual
funds, endorses QMS Inc., a Mobile, Ala., manufacturer of
computer printers and imaging systems. "The earnings trend
for the company is extremely strong," he says. He expects it
to earn $1.25 a share this fiscal year (ending in September),
up from 96 cents last year. In the year ending September 1991
he expects $1.45.
   A stock whose earnings are growing that fast deserves to
sell for 15 to 16 times earnings, Mr. Mench figures. So he
concludes that QMS will deserve a $19-to-$20 share price by
the end of this year. That's considerably above yesterday's
closing price of $13.50. Mr. Mench considers the stock a buy
at as much as $16.
   Mr. Kapner suggests MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2
long-distance telephone company. At yesterday's closing price
of $36.50, MCI sells for only about 12 times the earnings Mr.
Kapner expects for 1990 -- an average multiple. But it
deserves better, Mr. Kapner says.
   "We think rapid earnings growth at a 20-25% {annual} pace
is sustainable," he says. "MCI spent the bulk of the 1980s
pouring money into building a long-distance network. The
network is largely built. So the incremental cost of bringing
on new customers or having new volume go through those lines
is very small."
   In addition, Mr. Kapner says, MCI (with 12% of the market)
is continuing to nibble market share away from AT&amp;T (which
has 65%). He would buy MCI shares at prices up to $45 or so.
   For April, the pros are up against a dartboard portfolio
consisting of Caesars World Inc., Floating Point Systems
Inc., Longview Fibre Co. and Putnam Diversified Premium
Income Trust.

   Commodities:
   Copper Futures Drop After 3 Days of Advances
   Following Report That Canada Strike Is Over

   NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices fell back after three
days of advances following reports that a wildcat walkout by
workers at a Canadian mine had ended.
   The May contract ended 1.50 cents a pound lower at
$1.2090. The contract rose to its high of the day of $1.2340
just after the opening, following strength in London
generated by a severe drop in London Metal Exchange warehouse
stocks of copper. The exchange said its stocks declined
12,950 tons last week to 59,125 tons, the lowest level of
London Exchange copper inventories in almost two years. In
May 1988, 45,200 tons of copper were in store.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although most expectations Friday had been for a drop of
3,000 to 5,000 tons, some predicted withdrawals could amount
to much more than that, possibly to 10,000 tons or more, so
the big fall wasn't a complete surprise, analysts said.
   Its effect was quickly overcome, anyway, by a news service
report about the end of the wildcat strike at the Highland
Valley Copper mine in Logan Lake, British Columbia, analysts
said. The company spokesman was unavailable, as were details
of the settlement.
   Highland Valley machinists last Wednesday walked out in
protest over an outside contractor's use of its own laborers
while Highland Valley was laying off laborers, company
spokesman Rod Killough said on Friday. The machinists thought
the contractor should use Highland Valley laborers for that
part of its work, Mr. Killough said. Routine maintenance work
is handled by the company's staff, he said, but when special
skills are required, outside contractors are called in, he
said.
   At that time, he said the company was seeking an
injunction to force workers to return. He also noted that the
union, the United Steelworkers of America, didn't support the
walkout and was trying to get the workers to return.
   One analyst said that the May contract had a run-up of
almost six cents a pound in the previous three sessions and
that the U.S. economy was showing a generally sluggish tone.
He noted that the purchasing managers index for March was
48.8%, which was the 11th consecutive month below 50%. Also,
he said, stock markets world-wide were softer following sharp
declines in Tokyo.
   "Indications are that while there isn't a recession,
growth isn't robust either," he said. This, he said, could
have caused some traders to wonder if, when current supply
problems are solved in the copper industry, demand for copper
might slow down and influence a price drop in the second half
of the year.
   But Fred Demler, metals economist for PaineWebber, New
York, said major underlying market factors continue to
indicate support for the market, at least for the time being.
   Combined stocks of copper in London and New York exchanges
are down 50% since the start of the year, he said. During the
first two months, U.S. producer stocks are 37% lower than a
year earlier and consumer inventories have dropped 15%, he
noted.
   As for demand, world-wide consumption of copper was up 10%
in January from a year earlier, and U.S. brass and wire mill
use of copper during January and February was up 2% from the
year-earlier months, he said.
   "Reports of producer buying of copper also has helped to
firm prices," he said. "While producer buying of copper isn't
a routine thing, it isn't unheard of either. When it happened
in 1987, 1988 and 1989 it was a price-firming development
because these buyers were competing for material in a tightly
supplied market. That's what's happening now."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Petroleum futures prices were higher across the
board. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery was up
20 cents a barrel to settle at $20.48. Some fuel contracts
increased more than one cent a gallon. The May heating oil
contract gained 0.93 cent a gallon to 55.27 cents while May
gasoline rose 0.72 cent a gallon to 66.08 cents. There was
little industry news to account for the increases. Some oil
analysts and energy futures brokers attributed the gains to a
technical bounce. The settlement of the May crude contract
above $20.30 raises the possibility it could go to $21, said
Shahrokh Nikkhah, senior vice president, futures investments
at Prudential-Bache Securities. But, he added, "I'm still of
the view this is a bear market, and these are bear market
rallies."
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog and pork belly futures
contracts jumped in the wake of a government report that the
nation's hog-breeding herd shrank 4% on March 1 from the
year-earlier date. The report, which was released after the
close of trading Friday, also showed that the number of hogs
being raised for slaughter dropped 2% from March 1, 1989.
Most analysts didn't expect the government to report such a
steep drop in the breeding herd. The quarterly survey
indicates that U.S. hog farmers are continuing to liquidate
their herds. The prices of several hog contracts rose their
maximum daily permissible limit of 1.5 cents a pound and
settled at new life-of-contract highs. The prices of most
pork belly futures contracts rose their maximum daily
permissible limit of two cents a pound. Cattle prices also
rose yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures declined on a rumor that Brazil has been
shipping sugar, an analyst said. The May contract fell 0.60
cent a pound to 15.09 cents. According to Stephen Platt,
analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago, on Friday there
was a report that Brazil wouldn't sell sugar; yesterday it
was rumored that Brazil was shipping sugar, which caused
prices to fall. "Since the Alcohol and Sugar Institute was
disbanded by the new Brazilian administration, there has been
mass confusion as to what developments are taking place with
respect to sugar in that country," he said. "Reports that
Brazil was shipping sugar into the world market couldn't be
confirmed, but they caused selling in futures."
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices rose. The May contract ended
with a gain of 2.15 cents a pound at $2.0110. Cash prices for
the frozen concentrate remain higher than those of futures,
which is attracting demand from processors for futures
contracts, said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch, New
York. In turn, that demand caused traders who had previously
sold short in anticipation of a price decline to buy back
contracts, accelerating the advance, she said. Traders have
already factored current conditions into their thinking and
their focus is now turning to the forthcoming Brazilian
orange crop, Ms. Ganes said. "Anticipation is that the
1990-91 Brazilian orange crop, whose season begins on July 1,
will be smaller than the current one, which amounted to a
record 290 million boxes," she said. "Brazil experienced
ideal weather during the 1989-90 season," she added. A box
weighs 90 pounds.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices advanced. The May contract rose
1.46 cents a pound to 74.16 cents. Buying by computer-guided
funds, local traders and by other speculators absorbed
contracts sold by dealers and merchants, Ernest Simon, cotton
specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, said.
Foreign and domestic demand for cotton is strong, he noted,
and much of the current season's crop has already been
bought. Also, Mr. Simon noted, while the certified exchange
warehouse supplies of cotton for delivery against futures
contracts have declined somewhat from more than 200,000 bales
in late February and remain at a significant 194,000 bales,
there has been a continuous withdrawal of cotton from
exchange warehouses and 32,873 bales are awaiting
decertification. This steady shrinkage of supplies is helping
support prices of related futures contracts as well, he said.
Another analyst said that, as a result, prices for the May
and July contracts have risen to a significant premium over
contracts from October onward. The deferred contract prices
have been under pressure because of a government forecast
last week of increased plantings for the 1990-91 season.

   WASHINGTON -- A survey of the nation's purchasing managers
suggests the economy's manufacturing sector remained sluggish
in March.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by the National
Association of Purchasing Management, rose 0.5 percentage
point last month, to 48.8%. The association says any reading
below 50% indicates a contracting economy in manufacturing,
so the March increase suggests merely that the economy's rate
of decline has slowed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The index, which is based on a survey of purchasing
executives in more than 300 companies, is one of the first
measures of economic activity in any month and for that
reason is watched carefully by the financial markets.
   March marks the 11th consecutive month the index has
registered under 50%, but Robert Bretz, the association's
chairman, said that last month showed the smallest rate of
decline since June 1989. He said the associations' members
generally predict a stabilizing manufacturing economy at this
level. It "may be signaling a leveling-off in the 11-month
decline in the economy," said Mr. Brett, who is director of
materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.
   Index estimates display what Mr. Bretz called
"encouraging" increases in production, new orders and new
export orders.
   Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh, said the index indicates "a firming of activity
in the manufacturing sector."
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that
construction spending in February climbed 2.6% to an annual
rate of $436.5 billion, as building increased in all sectors
-- residential, nonresidential and government.
   Many economists attribute the increase in residential
construction spending to the weather. Residential building
grew 1.7% to a $198.5 billion annual rate after rising 3% in
January. Martin Regalia, chief economist at the National
Council of Savings Institutions, said regardless of the rise
he doesn't expect to see a housing boom as long as interest
rates remain where they are.
   "We're seeing small increases in the first quarter that
would be somewhat surprising to see maintained for the course
of the year," Mr. Regalia said. Residential building in 1990
may be a tad better than in 1989, however, he added.
   Nonresidential building climbed 5.5% in March to a $106.4
billion annual rate after surging 6.1% in January.
   After removing the effects of inflation, construction
spending in February was up 2.2%, to a $361.4 billion annual
rate, the department reported.
   Numbers in both reports are adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.
                                                                                                       

   Here are the Commerce Department's figures for
construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally

   4th-Period Loss
   Of $1.01 Billion

   Huge Write-Off Is Cited;
   Firm Warns It May Seek

   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said it had a loss of $1.01
billion for the fourth quarter after a $947 million write-off
of good will and warned that it might have to seek
bankruptcy-law protection if it can't complete a financial
restructuring.
   The owner and operator of 7-Eleven stores, burdened by a
monstrous debt load taken on when it went private in 1987,
said its current financial forecasts indicate that it will be
in violation of its bank-credit agreements during this year
and added that it doesn't believe it will be able to win
needed waivers unless it can reduce its debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, Southland said that its auditors have
included a paragraph in their year-end review of its
financial statements noting that there is "substantial doubt"
about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.
   The massive loss and the gloomy projections, the most
ominous signs yet of the company's worsening financial
position, follow Southland's disclosure last week that it has
agreed to sell 75% of its equity to its Japanese licensees
for $400 million. However, that agreement is contingent on
Southland's convincing holders of about $1.8 billion in
public debt to swap their debentures for stock and
zero-coupon bonds. The proposal already has met resistance
from bondholders, who don't want to give up cash interest
payments and who fret that the founding Thompson family is
retaining too much of the company at their expense.
   Southland's bleak predictions may also be a warning to
bondholders balking at the proposed restructuring. But Jack
Ackerman of Bond Review Co., whose investment advisory
company is working with Southland bondholders, said the
holders still will want to know why they can't receive at
least some cash interest on new debt issues.
   "Our preference is to do an out-of-bankruptcy settlement
if possible," he said, although some bondholders have said
they wouldn't mind working out a plan under court
supervision. Although Southland isn't expected to officially
propose its debt-swap offer until later this month, the
bondholders already have formed a steering committee and hope
to meet with company officials soon.
   In the meantime, the company said it received waivers from
certain bank covenants from its senior bank group, which is
owed about $924 million, but the agreement requires it to
submit a restructuring plan before May 31 and complete the
restructuring by Dec. 1.
   While a Southland spokeswoman conceded that the company's
financial position is troubled, she said the company is
confident that it has begun work on a restructuring plan
"well in advance" of a crisis.
   In disclosing its quarterly loss, Southland said it
decided to take the huge write-off of good will, or the
amount over the fair value of the assets acquired in the
company's $4.9 billion leveraged buy-out, after it and its
auditor, Deloitte &amp; Touche, evaluated the convenience store
industry and tried to determine the true value of that good
will. As the good will initially was to be amortized over 40
years, the write-off eliminates a $26 million-a-year non-cash
expense and won't affect Southland's liquidity or its tax
liabilities.
   In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Southland had a net
loss of $37 million. Revenue for the latest fourth quarter
was $2.06 billion, up 4.4% from $1.97 billion in the 1988
period. The company said that, on an inflation-adjusted
basis, its merchandise sales at stores open more than a year
fell, as did its gasoline profits. The company attributed the
decline in gasoline profits to its fewer stores owned and to
a drop in gas sales per store, a possible reflection of its
decision to sell a brand-name gas and to abandon its policy
of offering the cheapest price on the block.
   For the year, Southland had a loss of $1.32 billion,
compared with a loss of $285.2 million in 1988. In addition
to the write-off of good will, the company had a $56 million
charge related to a debt swap a year ago and $69.4 million in
income from discontinued operations. The year-ago results
also included $69 million in profit from discontinued
operations.
   Revenue for the year was $8.35 billion, up 4.5% from $7.99
billion in 1988.

   Let's Kill Bank Reserve Requirements

   With many banks in deep trouble, why would anyone suggest
abolishing reserve requirements? Actually, there couldn't be
a better time.
   The idea that banks should put aside some money just in
case depositors start beating on their doors has a long
history. Robert Auerbach, in his textbook, "Financial Markets
and Institutions," says reserve requirements were first
imposed by the state of Virginia in 1837. In 1864 the
coverage of requirements was greatly expanded when the
National Bank Act stipulated that banks were to hold reserves
against deposit liabilities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nearly everyone thought that the aim was to ensure the
safety of deposits and the soundness of the banking system.
Most people now recognize that setting requirements at the
levels that have existed is a little bit like requiring every
home owner to keep a pail of water handy for future fires. In
the real world the requirements proved to be useless against
the bank runs of the early 1930s.
   There was a way around that problem. Over the years,
Irving Fisher, Milton Friedman and some other economists have
urged 100% reserve banking. It would give the depositors much
greater safety, and also change the existing system so
drastically that the idea has never gotten anywhere. In any
case, deposit insurance now largely protects depositors,
although it hasn't been the best of news to taxpayers.
   For many years, required reserves were supposed to play a
role in monetary policy. If the Federal Reserve raised
requirements, banks would have smaller free reserves and
would be able to lend less. The money supply would grow more
slowly. Supposedly, it worked the other way, too. If the
banks had more reserves they would make more loans.
   In 1936, however, the banks had a lot of excess reserves
but weren't lending very much. So the Fed figured they didn't
need the reserves; it jacked up requirements. The banks,
frightened by the Depression, cut their loans, trying to
offset the higher requirements. So the Fed raised
requirements again, and the banks slowed their lending even
more. The result was the recession of 1937-38, an event that
soured many people on using required reserves for monetary
policy.
   For years the Fed has hardly used the requirements at all,
possibly because of this demonstration of how powerful they
are. The rules have been modified occasionally. From 1969
until the Depository Institutions Deregulatory and Monetary
Control Act of 1980, reserve requirements allowed banks to
base reserves not on current deposits but on deposits two
weeks earlier. This greatly increased the volatility of
interest rates and monetary policy.
   But the requirements persist. Why? Some people suggest
that cutting or reducing the requirements would cut revenue
of the Treasury and increase the budget deficit. The Fed buys
a lot of Treasury securities and gives a large portion of its
earnings to the Treasury. That in itself is one of the
strange aspects of Fed history; the payments to the Treasury
are supposed to be for the privilege of issuing Federal
Reserve notes.
   However, Jerry Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate
Bank of Los Angeles, remarks that the arguments that
requirements should be retained to make money for the
Treasury "should be rejected as a cynical response that
places short-term political objectives ahead of the creation
of a more sound and efficient financial sector."
   Other major countries appear to be deciding that reserve
requirements serve no useful purpose. Britain has a
requirement of only one-half of 1%, a fact that is causing
central banks elsewhere in Europe to lower their requirements
because of competitive forces associated with the monetary
unification of Europe. "In 1988," Mr. Jordan notes, "the
Swiss National Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia
eliminated reserve requirements altogether. The Bank of
Canada also is in the process of eliminating reserve
requirements because they are no longer viewed as essential
for the conduct of monetary policy."
   It would be enough of an argument against reserve
requirements to show that they are essentially useless. The
statute books are cluttered with too many rules that achieve
no worthwhile purpose. But the argument goes beyond that.
   On the one hand, government regulators are pressing
financial institutions to increase their capital. This
pressure makes sense, since many institutions have had
serious problems, at a time when they are facing an
increasing global demand for their services.
   What doesn't make sense is that at the same time the
government is imposing reserve requirements, what amount to
severe taxes on the institutions. Their reserves at the Fed
earn no interest.
   Mr. Jordan urges that the Federal Reserve announce a
program of reducing reserve requirements from the current 12%
to the statutory minimum of 8%. Then the Fed should seek new
legislation to permit reducing the requirement to zero or, at
most, to a level that doesn't exceed the minimum needed for
purposes of clearing.
   At the moment, unfortunately, the Fed appears to be moving
in the wrong direction by proposing that the existing
excessive reserve requirements be extended to foreign
deposits at U.S. bank subsidiaries and branches. "That idea,"
Mr. Jordan says, "is a nonstarter. International competitive
factors will not permit it."
   If the Fed wants to reduce the inequity between foreign
and domestic deposits, the easy way to do it is to reduce the
requirement for domestic deposits, not raise it for foreign
accounts.
   Perhaps there was a time when reserve requirements made a
certain amount of sense. If so, that time has clearly come
and gone.

   Sonnenblick-Goldman Forms Venture,
   As Japanese Continue Foray Into U.S.

   NEW YORK -- Mortgage broker Sonnenblick-Goldman Corp.
formed a partnership with Daishinpan Co., in the latest
Japanese foray into the U.S. real estate market.
   Daishinpan will own less than 40% of the new firm, with
options to increase its holding to about 55%, people familiar
with the transaction said. The Japanese company also will
contribute an unspecified amount of capital to the firm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Real estate executives say deals such as this partnership
are a way for Japanese institutions to invest in U.S. real
estate, while escaping the limelight that attended Japanese
purchases of such properties as Rockefeller Center in
Manhattan.
   "The Rockefeller deal scared some people and made them
want to see Japanese deals done in a certain way," said Gary
Barth, managing director of Jones Lang Wootton USA, a
British-owned real estate firm.
   The Sonnenblick-Daishinpan partnership follows a pattern
set by other Japanese-U.S. ventures where the American entity
provides the expertise and the Japanese company supplies the
money and overseas distribution network.
   Daishinpan, a credit company with about $13 billion in
assets, will give Sonnenblick entry into Japan's vast
consumer market, allowing Sonnenblick to sell small chunks of
U.S. properties to individuals. More significantly,
Sonnenblick executives said, Daishinpan's capital base will
allow Sonnenblick to compete in growing Western European and
Asian markets.
   "We have never had to be a capital-rich company before,"
said Jack Shaffer, Sonnenblick managing director. "With the
changing market, we felt we had to have a capital base to do
things we couldn't do before."
   Sonnenblick Goldman is an old-line mortgage broker whose
main lines of business involve raising money for real estate
developers and acting as adviser on property sales. The
company is structured as a partnership; before the Daishinpan
transaction, it was 25%-owned by Robert M. Bass Interests and
25% by Interstate Properties Co. In the recent past,
Sonnenblick has raised money through such Japanese
institutions as Sumitomo Trust, Industrial Bank of Japan and
Kokusai Motors.
   Daishinpan is Japan's second-largest credit company. It is
controlled by a long list of Japanese institutions, including
Sanwa Bank, Daiwa Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and Nippon
Life, which own from 2% to 5% each of Daishinpan.
   Daishinpan's entry into the U.S. real estate market
mirrors other Japanese efforts to hook up with existing
companies. Early this year, Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking Co.
acquired a non-controlling interest in Lepercq Capital
Partners. Also, Nomura Securities owns 50% of Eastdil Realty,
and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Japan's owns 25% of
LaSalle Partners Ltd., a Chicago pension adviser.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is also negotiating an agreement with
Daiwa Securities Co. to form a joint venture that would sell
U.S. real estate securities in Japan.

   Brazil's Sweeping Measures Aimed at Inflation
   Could Hurt Earnings of Several U.S. Firms

   NEW YORK -- Grab hold of your in-box. Give it a quick,
violent jerk, and watch the papers scatter. That will give
you a rough idea of what the economy of Brazil looks like at
the moment.
   Intent on stopping runaway inflation, new President
Fernando Collor de Mello has instituted a series of sweeping
measures, including restricting people's access to their own
money held in bank accounts. By yanking the economy to a
sudden halt, instituting a new currency, and slapping on
price controls (among other steps), Mr. Collor hopes to break
inflation's back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the process will be painful for many Brazilians.
According to analysts, it may also hurt earnings for several
U.S. companies with big operations in Brazil, such as
Aluminum Co. of America, Champion International, Ford,
General Motors and Union Carbide.
   Securities firms are scrambling to assess the impact.
Early off the starting line is PaineWebber, weighing in with
a report by strategist Edward M. Kerschner (with economic
analyst William Dinning).
   The Collor plan "goes well beyond what anyone had imagined
he would do," Mr. Kerschner says. "Of the four possible
reform plans that incoming finance minister Ms. Zelia Cordoso
de Mello had drawn up, Collor went for the most radical. . .
. (It) has thrown the seventh largest economy in the world
into waters rarely charted by any economy.
   "For Brazil, a very steep recession seems likely," Mr.
Kerschner concluded. "Most economic activity has ceased. For
example, General Motors did not sell a single car in Brazil
last week."
   Aluminum Co. of America derives "at least 15% of its
operating income" in Brazil, estimates Clarence Morrison,
metals analyst with Prudential-Bache. An Alcoa spokesman says
he thinks that figure is "a little high." But he confirmed
that Brazil accounted for 11% of Alcoa's net income last
year.
   The spokesman said that Alcoa has been "down there for
about 25 years. It's been good for us and we think in the
long run it will continue to be good for us." However, he
said "what's going on presents some challenges" to Alcoa near
term. He declined to estimate the possible earnings impact.
   Union Carbide has a large industrial gases operation in
Brazil, notes Ted Semegran, a chemical analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton. He says a rapid slowing of Brazil's economy
could hurt the business, and is also worried about the
possibility of write-downs connected with currency
devaluation.
   Mr. Semegran emphasized that it's too early to know what
will happen. But if the Brazilian operations went to
break-even, he figures it might clip as much as 10% off Union
Carbide's earnings.
   John R. MacLean, president of Union Carbide Industrial
Gases Corp. (which includes the industrial gas operations in
the U.S., as well as Latin America) says he thinks Brazil's
government is "doing the right thing." He added, "We would
endure any kind of short-term pain" to do business in a
Brazil that was rid of hyperinflation.
   The effects on first-quarter earnings will be very small,
Mr. MacLean said. In the second quarter, he said, "there will
be some negative short-term effects," which he declined to
estimate. He agreed with Mr. Semegran's assessment that if
the Brazilian operations went to break-even, Carbide's
earnings might fall about 10%.
   Champion International, a forest products company, derived
about 20% of its net income last year from Brazilian
operations, according to the PaineWebber report. A Champion
spokesman couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.
   Ford was selling more than 2,000 cars a week in Brazil
last year, and GM was selling more than 3,000 a week.
According to PaineWebber, both companies have stopped
producing cars and sent their staffs home on full pay. "This
could be a significant negative for the earnings of both
companies," PaineWebber said, adding that GM is losing money
on North American auto operations and relies on sales outside
North America for profits.
   Spokesmen for GM and Ford both said yesterday that it's
too early to assess the earnings impact of the Brazil
situation. According to figures provided by a Ford spokesman,
Brazil accounted for about 1.7% of Ford's world-wide truck
and car sales last year.
   The stock most directly affected by Brazil's financial
crisis is Brazil Fund, an investment fund that invests in
Brazilian companies and trades on the New York Stock
Exchange. On March 20, the fund announced it would "halt
temporarily the determination of the fund's net asset value."
That halt is still in effect, and the fund's portfolio
manager declined to be interviewed yesterday.
   Yet last month, Brazil Fund shares dropped only 15%, to 11
from 13. That decline was surprisingly mild, considering that
the Brazilian stock market had fallen 40% to 50%, says
Charles H. Brandes, chief investment officer of Brandes
Investment Management in San Diego.
   Mr. Brandes bought Brazil Fund shares at 7 last year, when
they traded at about a 40% discount from net asset value, or
NAV (the value of the shares in the portfolio). He rode the
shares up to 16, then sold because they were at a premium to
NAV.
   Mr. Brandes guesses that Brazil Fund's NAV now is $9 to
$10 a share. He is watching the stock but says, "It hasn't
gone low enough for me yet." He would be eager to buy if the
shares again fall to a 40% discount, which at the moment
would equal a share price of 6 to 7.

   Executive Predicts
   Oil Prices to Stay
   Close to Inflation

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
PETROLEUM (PET)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW ORLEANS -- Despite forecasts by some experts, oil
prices won't rise on the average much faster than the rate of
inflation over the next several years, a top executive of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group predicted.
   Through the 1990s, that will translate into about a $1 a
year added to the per-barrel price of oil, Sir Peter Holmes,
chairman of Shell Transport &amp; Trading, one of the two owners
of the giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said in an interview.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sir Peter conceded that prices could continue to move like
"a roller coaster," bouncing around within an upwardly moving
$4 range. But he said the Shell Group is forecasting a
generally moderate overall trend because it believes the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will expand
production to meet growing world demand. OPEC, which
currently supplies about 45% of the non-Communist world's
oil, is considered pivotal to future price movements.
   Recently, a number of forecasters have projected world oil
demand will grow faster than production capacity, triggering
a spike that could double prices by the mid-1990s. Current
world oil prices range from about $16 a barrel to $20 a
barrel.
   In taking a more conservative view, Sir Peter also cited
OPEC's apparent desire to avoid a rerun of past rapid price
escalations that produced world turmoil. "They don't want to
see prices run away," he said. In particular, he said,
"Kuwait is determined to keep prices low."
   The Shell Group estimates that OPEC's largest producer,
Saudi Arabia, will meet its goal of expanding daily
production capacity to 8.5 million to 10 million barrels from
current capacity of 7.8 million. The other OPEC members with
the potential and desire to boost output -- Iran, Iraq, and
the United Arab Emirates -- also will meet their goals early
in the 1990s, he said.
   As a result, Sir Peter predicted, OPEC's daily production
will stay at a comfortable level in relation to capacity. "If
OPEC production remains at around 80% of installed capacity,
it is unlikely you will see prices surge either upward or
downward," he said. In the past, when OPEC output crossed the
80% threshold, he said, prices became far more volatile.
   OPEC's Secretary-General Subroto has been saying that OPEC
will need to spend $60 billion over the next several years to
raise its capacity to meet demand for its oil. Subroto has
asked for help from international oil companies, but Sir
Peter doesn't think many countries will seek such outside
financing.
   "I don't think the Saudis, Kuwait or the U.A.E. will need
any at all," he said. "Over five years, $60 billion isn't
that much."
   Sir Peter said Iran and Iraq may need some help and
disclosed that the company has talked with Iraq officials.
"They have been welcoming and then less welcoming," he said.
   The Shell Group sees big opportunities, however, in the
Soviet Union. "We're trying real hard to get in," Sir Peter
said. "It will happen but I think it will be slow." He said
current Soviet oil technology is outdated. "They are
operating with techniques we used 30 and 40 years ago," he
said. "A couple of decades doesn't sound like much, but in
our industry that's the stone age."

   Where the Buffalo Don't Roam

   Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.
   The solitary buffalo crossed an open field near Rescue
Creek Trail. Enormous, old, he walked stiff-legged and
without hurry. His massive head with its thick, curling,
almost-black hair bobbed up and down, sniffing the earth,
delicately picking up bits of grass to eat. On his shoulders
and hump the curling hair had turned pale cinnamon, as it
often does in old bulls, while his slender back and hips were
the same deep brown they had always been. Noble ice-age
beast, he ambled through sagebrush, carrying in his ancient
heart all the centuries of his existence. He has been in
Yellowstone since the last glaciers left, 10,000 years ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Rescue Creek trailhead is not far from the park's
north entrance, at Gardiner, and the boundary between the
park and the state of Montana. Would the old bull cross to be
greeted by a hunter's gun? A hunt takes place when there is a
chance buffalo (more correctly, bison) will wander onto
Montana ranchlands. Because they can carry brucellosis, which
causes cattle to abort if they come into contact with the
fresh afterbirth of an aborted bison fetus, ranchers are
understandably concerned if bison cross the boundary.
   But buffalo do not recognize boundaries. Their "captivity"
inside the park goes against their migratory nature. When
stressed by severe winters, nature prevails. They have left
the park periodically over the years, although never in such
great numbers as two winters ago when 569 -- half the herd --
were shot, nor in the presence of such media coverage.
   It was February when I watched the old bull. There was a
sense of spring in the air. Perhaps, I thought, we'll make it
through the winter with no hunt beyond the one buffalo shot
early in the season. But within a few weeks there was new
snow, and 20 bison left the park near West Yellowstone. The
hunt was on, and off, and on again as bison wandered back and
forth across the border. "Probably the number of animals
taken this year will be quite small," said John Cada,
regional wildlife manager for the Montana Department of Fish,
Wildlife and Parks. "If you can sting them a little when they
first come out," he explained, "they're more apt to go back.
If you let them lounge around, they begin to think of the
area as home. It's easier to keep them out of a new area than
run them out of home."
   In mid-March three bison were shot. Animal-rights
activists were on the scene to disrupt the event. Two
protesters were arrested, one on charges of misdemeanor
assault, the other for interfering with a lawful hunt. The
activists called their cohorts' behavior "inappropriate," but
reiterated their belief that the real crime is killing bison.
After that hunt the protesters tried herding bison back into
Yellowstone. Park officials warned them away, saying the
attempt constituted harassment of wild animals, which could
not be permitted in the park.
   It probably wouldn't have had much effect anyway. While
some bison can be moved for short periods of time, basically
bison will go only where bison want to go. Numerous attempts
to keep them in the park -- hazing, cattle guards, fences,
recorded wolf-howls, sirens, tin-can rattles and cracker
shells, flashing lights, rubber bullets -- have not worked.
Besides that, any plan designed to keep animals in the park
runs counter to park policy of keeping animals wild by
allowing them natural movement through their natural habitat.
   "Just as no one is saying we should keep all the elk in
the park, no one should be saying bison must be kept in the
park," said Ed Lewis, executive director of the Bozeman-based
Greater Yellowstone Coalition. "Yellowstone has the only
free-roaming bison population and any management plan must
allow for it to continue."
   GYC has been instrumental in initiating the possibility of
a viable management plan by bringing together the Park
Service, U.S. Forest Service and the Dept. of Fish, Wildlife
and Parks, the agencies that deal with bison in the
ecosystem. They also have succeeded in getting the agencies'
agreement to maintain a core herd of 200 to 300 bison,
enough, according to park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo, that
visitors will see bison herds in the park.
   Shooting a buffalo isn't really terrific sport. It's sort
of like shooting a cow. "They are pastoral animals," said
Bozeman sculptor Brian Persha, who is outraged at the hunt's
denial of the buffalo's nature. Mr. Persha, who feels that
GYC's attempt to find an alternative to the hunt must be
supported, is donating proceeds from the sale of his work to
them. Making multiples of his sculpture for the first time,
Mr. Persha has created three bronzes, one of them a small,
reclining buffalo. Resting, waiting, eternal, his buffalo is
an eloquent statement of that great animal's quiet power.
   It is also one approach to what, at times, seems an
impossibly polarized problem -- to shoot or not to shoot.
"Population control has to happen," the wildlife department's
Mr. Cada said, "either by ranger or other hunters, or
rounding them up and selling them to the slaughterhouses.
Thirty years ago we were doing the same thing with elk. For a
similar reason. We didn't have a place for those Yellowstone
elk. Even though it took us a few years, our goal was to
acquire key pieces of winter range. We'll still hunt elk, but
instead of a firing line at the park boundary, we can manage
them.
   "I look at this as an opportunity. Things have to be major
to get support and we're talking about a major commitment
from society. We hope that society says, `Hey, I'm willing to
put my money where my mouth is and authorize Congress to buy
range out of the park.'"
   Leaving the old bull at Rescue Creek, I drove on to the
Lamar Valley. Broad, wild, silent, filled with light and
time, the valley opens before you as you come out of Lamar
Canyon like some primeval dream of land. It was here that the
Buffalo Ranch was established in 1907, five years after
captive herds of plains buffalo were introduced into
Yellowstone in an attempt to reestablish a wild herd. The
remnant of the wild mountain buffalo that had always lived in
Yellowstone mingled and prospered under the improved
protection that came with the newcomers. The experiment
successful, the ranch was disbanded in the 1950s. Lamar is
one of three winter ranges now used by Yellowstone's buffalo.
   The Lamar River ran dark and sparkling between banks of
wind-polished snow. Groups of buffalo were spread along its
length, their tracks crisscrossing the broad flats extending
south and east of the river. Wherever the animals had
stopped, the snow was churned, scuffed, pocked and pawed.
Buffalo are as evident where they are not as where they are.
   The road through Lamar is one of the few park roads that
is plowed. Not many cars had passed as I watched the buffalo,
but as I drove back, I found myself in a traffic jam.
Buffalo, larger than my car, walked up and down the middle of
the road, then ran across it, stopped on the opposite side,
returned to the road, crossed back and, finally, ran a few
feet alongside the road before disappearing from my view
behind a small rise. How thoroughly this place is theirs, I
thought.

   Plans to Give a Fortune

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Stephen Sander ushers a
visitor into the meditation room of his home. A panorama of
the city's waterfront fills a picture window. Soothing sitar
music plays in the background. His wife pours herbal tea.
   It was here, in the middle of his daily yoga session, that
he decided to give away property worth $170 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It was a seed that blossomed in my mind," says Mr.
Sander, who had spent the last two decades building his
real-estate empire. After allowing for mortgages, his gift
nets out to about $110 million. "I wish," he says now, "that
other people could see how good it feels to give away money."
   A few weeks ago, Mr. Sander signed over to a charitable
trust the titles of 23 luxury apartment buildings he owned in
downtown Vancouver and its suburbs. The trust, Consciousness
International Foundation, will use its rental income to,
among other things, finance projects in the Third World. Mr.
Sander says he expects the money to start flowing in October.
   All this may sound a bit more 1960s than 1990s. But Mr.
Sander is no flower child. Born Sukhwant Singh, he grew up in
a refugee camp in India. His family had fled Moslem-ruled
Pakistan in the mid-1940s when the British partitioned India.
He spent seven years living on the streets of Delhi, herding
cows for $8 a month. He slept with the animals. "I can still
remember waking up with ticks all over me," he says with a
shudder.
   He emigrated to Canada in 1960 for a job teaching physical
education in Nova Scotia. In the early 1970s, he made his way
to Vancouver, where he struck his first real-estate deal. He
bought a house outside of town for $4,000, then traded it for
25 acres that he later sold for $25,000.
   Mr. Sander promptly quit teaching and changed his name to
Stephen Sander. He says he picked the name because it sounded
vaguely British, and it seemed to allay the fears of business
contacts who appeared nervous about dealing with a foreigner.
   He picked a good time to change careers. Vancouver real
estate has been on an extended roll for the past two decades,
in part because of an influx of well-to-do Asians. Immigrants
from Hong Kong alone pumped some $2.5 billion into the city's
real-estate market last year.
   Over the past two decades, Mr. Sander has gained a
reputation as one of Vancouver's shrewdest and most
successful real-estate investors. Buying properties was a
passion. "I could smell blood," he recalls. "I enjoyed the
chase and the kill."
   By the early 1980s, he had accumulated a portfolio he
valued at $70 million -- "solid gold stuff," according to a
local real-estate lawyer. Yet the landlord lived more simply
than many of his tenants. He drove a battered Volkswagen
Beetle, dressed in old clothes while shopping for properties
and worked "out of my hat," as he puts it.
   He currently drives a 10-year-old Jaguar. His home is a
modest three-bedroom overlooking the city's skyline. There
are no tennis courts, no pool and no servants. But there is a
room loaded with Nautilus equipment for his wife, who was his
aerobics instructor before they wed in 1985. The
abstemiousness was, in part, a ploy. "If people don't know
you're rich, they let their guard down and don't try to cheat
you as fast," he says.
   Despite his success, he felt something was missing. "I'd
make a $20 million deal and come home and say, `This is
insane. I need something for my soul,'" says Mr. Sander, who
is trim, athletic and only slightly gray at the temples. He
is a Sikh, but he says religion didn't play any part in his
decision.
   "I'll leave behind a real legacy, not just a lot of real
estate," he says. "I can't see any better way to use my
fortune. I'm 55, and making a lot of money isn't doing
anything for me anymore. I'm keeping enough to be
comfortable."
   Under the terms establishing the trust, neither Mr. Sander
nor his family will be left penniless. Some $5.5 million will
go to his seven children from two previous marriages. He, his
third wife, Nancy, and their four-year-old daughter will get
$500,000, their three-bedroom home and three cars. "We can
live comfortably on $40,000 a year," Mr. Sander says, adding
that he has left the real-estate business for good.
   His decision stunned many of his business associates. "He
is best known for his appetite for buying apartment houses,
not giving them away," says Michael Keenan, a local
real-estate agent. "It's unbelievable," says Kelly Heed, an
agent who has done business with Mr. Sander since 1971. Mr.
Sander, he says, was "tight as hell."
   Each year, Mr. Sander's Consciousness International
Foundation will grant a dozen or so "cosmic consciousness
awards" of $25,000 to $30,000 to humanitarians in the Third
World. Mr. Sander and a board of his choosing will name the
recipients, whom he has dubbed "lighthouses," and channel
additional funds for local projects such as hospitals.
   This year, Consciousness International expects to dispense
about $1 million. One of its first projects is an orphanage
in Sri Lanka. Within three years, the foundation plans to
distribute about $5 million a year. Its $170 million in
assets apparently makes it the second largest charitable
trust in Canada, after one established by the Bronfman family
of Montreal, whose members are heirs to the Seagram liquor
fortune.
   Not everyone in Vancouver is applauding Mr. Sander,
though. Just before turning his buildings over to the
foundation, he increased apartment rents -- by as much as
30%. "Charity begins at home," grumbles Patricia Waddell, an
out-of-work interior designer who rents a one-bedroom unit in
one of his buildings. Vancouver's Mayor Gordon Campbell
echoes her sentiments, saying the philanthropist should have
chosen to back local charities. "I haven't heard much about
him," the mayor says, "and I have no intention of contacting
or congratulating him."
   Mr. Sander shrugs off the criticisms as "sour grapes."
Furthermore, he says, the rents for units in foundation-owned
buildings are in line with those of the city's other luxury
apartment houses.
   In any event, Mr. Sander has plenty of other concerns
these days. Word of his foundation has drawn hundreds of
would-be "lighthouses." One New Jersey man flew here last
month and begged for 15 minutes of his time. Mr. Sander
reluctantly granted an audience. "He shut the door of my
office," he recalls, "and started asking me for tips on local
real-estate bargains."
   Now that he has discovered philanthropy, Mr. Sander is
determined to share the secret. At press conferences across
Canada, he has been urging his wealthy brethren to unburden
themselves of their riches. "Lots of people made money in the
1980s," he says. "We want to make it fashionable to give away
money."
   But so far, Mr. Sander's vision of himself as the Pied
Piper of philanthropy hasn't quite jelled. "Stephen is a bit
disappointed he hasn't become the catalyst he hoped,"
concedes his lawyer, Douglas Scarlett.
   But that hasn't dissuaded him. He says he has his eye on
just the man to follow in his footsteps: Donald Trump. "How
many billions does he need?" he says, pledging to carry his
message to the New York billionaire. "He'll find it's very
relieving to give it away," says Mr. Sander.

   Comerica Inc., Detroit, said it has entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire InBancshares, City of
Industry, Calif., for about $40 million.
   The merger will be the second in California for Comerica,
a bank holding company with $12 billion in assets.
InBancshares, a bank holding company with $242 million in
assets, has 70 employees at four office locations in City of
Industry, Encino, Santa Ana and San Francisco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Comerica said the $40 million purchase price represents
$20.25 a share for InBancshares common stock. That "will
represent approximately two times book value and 10 times
expected 1991 earnings," Comerica added.
   Comerica said the transaction, which requires regulatory
approval, should be completed in the first quarter of 1991.
That's the same timetable as Comerica's other California
acquisition of Plaza Commerce Bancorp, a San Jose bank
holding company with $485 million in assets. Jan. 1, 1991, is
the earliest date that a Michigan bank holding firm can

   Miami financier Victor Posner said he holds a 5% stake in
Smith Laboratories Inc., San Diego, for investment purposes.
   Mr. Posner said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that he holds 674,735 Smith common
shares, for which he paid $1,545,291. On March 21, Mr. Posner
bought 66,000 Smith shares in the open market for $3.125
each.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Posner said he acquired his Smith stock for investment
purposes. He will review periodically his investment in the
company and may at any time decide to increase or decrease
it, he said, depending on market conditions and other
factors. He said he does not have any present plans or
proposals with respect to the company.
   Last December, Smith entered into a merger agreement with
Columbia Hospital Corp., a closely held hospital concern
controlled by former Bass family financial adviser Richard
Rainwater and Richard Scott of Fort Worth, Texas.
   Timothy Wollaeger, president and chief executive officer
of Smith, a maker of medical equipment, said he believed Mr.
Posner had boosted his stake in the company for investment
purposes only. "I view it neither favorably nor unfavorably,"
Mr. Wollaeger said.

   CHICAGO -- William Farley's company that was set up for
the acquisition of West Point-Pepperell Inc. defaulted on
$796 million in bank debt and missed bondholder interest
payments.
   Officials of the acquisition company acknowledged the
default, which had been expected. They also said the
acquisition unit was negotiating with bankers and had made an
exchange offer to subordinated bondholders as part of a
restructuring effort.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While details of that exchange offer weren't disclosed, a
Wall Street person close to the negotiations said holders
would be offered a significant equity position in the target
company, West Point-Pepperell Inc., if they agreed to delayed
interest payments. Interest on about $705 million in
subordinated debt was to have been paid yesterday.
   In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Farley said the
defaults by West Point Acquisition Corp. won't affect West
Point-Pepperell. It said the debt is structured to prevent
cross-defaults.
   Still, some close to the transaction believe that default
could presage a change of ownership in the huge textile
maker, based in West Point, Ga., because the banks that lent
Mr. Farley money to make the acquisition last year hold most
of its stock as collateral.

   PLEASANTON, Calif. -- Donald Kingsborough has a new
company to play with.
   Mr. Kingsborough, former chairman and chief executive
officer of Worlds of Wonder Inc., is now head of newly formed
Intelligy Corp., which plans to sell educational games and
toys for children. The company said it is developing products
it plans to introduce in late summer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a news release, Intelligy cites Mr. Kingsborough's
tenure at Worlds of Wonder, "one of the nation's fastest and
most successful start-ups in history" -- without mentioning
that it also became one of the industry's most spectacular
failures.
   Intelligy marks Mr. Kingsborough's third attempt to find
lasting success in the toy business. He was a top sales
executive for video game maker Atari Inc. when that company's
market suddenly dried up. In 1983, Atari, then owned by
Warner Communications Inc., posted a loss of $538.6 million.
After that, he regrouped with other former Atari managers to
found Worlds of Wonder in 1985. That company chalked up huge
sales and zoomed to the top of the toy industry.
   But in 1987, Worlds of Wonder filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
Mr. Kingsborough resigned in April 1988 at the request of
creditors.

   The agreement -- covering 13,500 active employees and
laid-off workers plus 46,000 retirees -- provides for
restoration of previous wage and benefit concessions,
additional raises totaling $1.50 an hour and an immediate
payment of $1,000 per worker. The lump sum includes a $500
signing bonus and a $500 advance on the 1990 profit sharing.
   Effective April 15, the employees will receive restoration
of base wage cuts amounting to $1.61 an hour, LTV said, plus
restored shift differentials and Sunday premiums. Employees
will get raises of $1 an hour on Jan. 1, 1991, and 50 cents
an hour on Jan. 1, 1992.

   Research Firm Taps Oceans of Data to Bail Out Clients
   ---
   But IQ Inc. Finds Such Intangibles
   As Information Can Be a Hard Sell

   Not long ago, Loeffler Ketchum Mountjoy was in a tizzy. On
just four days' notice, officials of Bojangles' Corp., which
runs a chain of fried-chicken restaurants, wanted to meet
with the little Charlotte, N.C., ad agency to discuss
retaining it.
   But Loeffler knew barely a lick about the fried-chicken
business and feared that boning up would take at least two
weeks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What to do? Loeffler called IQ Inc., a very small, very
specialized research concern in Maynard, Mass. Within 48
hours, harnessing computers, IQ ransacked thousands of
publications for facts, then churned out two 25-page reports
that it sped to the client. Loeffler won over Bojangles', a
Horn &amp; Hardart Co. unit whose estimated ad billings exceed
$500,000 a year. "IQ made us look smart," says Jeffrey Petit,
a Loeffler supervisor.
   At first blush, IQ -- short for "information quickly," not
"intelligence quotient" -- also looks smart. In the age of
information overload, IQ's niche is selling business
information -- the sort that is out there somewhere but that
most people can't find quickly on their own. For example, IQ
has identified the leaders in vacuum-pump technology (Balzer
Inc., for one), traced the retail value of all the hot dogs
sold in the U.S. ($1.5 billion in 1983) and fingered a maker
of frozen milkshakes made for thawing in microwave ovens
(United Dairies of Ohio). Little escapes IQ: It is expert in
tapping the oceans of data in publicly accessible computer
data bases -- a booming technology.
   But IQ, while profitable, isn't necessarily on a sure-fire
path to enormous success. Five years after IQ was founded,
the company has served just 150 clients and its annual
revenue is less than $2 million. Founder David Manshel, a
35-year-old former ad-agency account supervisor, concedes,
"It has been a rough road."
   Indeed, IQ faces a problem common to growing numbers of
new companies as the American economy tilts more and more
toward services: Instead of offering a familiar product, more
companies are tying their fortunes to amorphous services that
are barely familiar, or totally unfamiliar, to the target
audience.
   That makes business start-ups all the harder. Selling such
intangibles as advice, insurance and market forecasts is
tough because "you can't ask someone from a laboratory to
come in with a prototype so everyone can look, touch and feel
it," says Mark Deck, a principal of Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane
Inc., a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm. An intangible
service is "just something in your head" in the eyes of the
prospective customer, Mr. Deck says.
   IQ isn't selling any proprietary information of its own
and can't even be certain what its computers will fish up for
a client. The challenge for IQ -- and for a few similar
concerns -- is getting companies to pay "to know what they
don't know," as Mr. Manshel puts it. And clients can't know
if the unknown is worth paying for until after they've paid
for it.
   "It's a lengthy sell," says Mr. Manshel, who financed IQ
through loans from his family and friends and through
savings. "You have to constantly give examples of where you
can be helpful."
   As the number of data bases available to libraries has
soared into the hundreds, greater expertise is required to
master all the possibilities for harvesting data. IQ says it
can find information that customers can't find on their own
because they don't know where to look. For each assignment,
IQ charges a minimum of $500 -- and sometimes thousands of
dollars, depending on the scope of the job. But left to their
own devices, IQ says, customers would waste a fortune
searching indiscriminately through data bases (which
typically charge by the minute for access).
   Maybe so, but many companies still doubt the need for IQ
when they have their own in-house information centers. Some
may balk at IQ's rates, since simple computer searches
normally involve only about $15 in data-base charges,
according to industry figures. Others hesitate to depend too
heavily on a single outside research firm, lest it miss
something crucial.
   Mr. Manshel directs 12 part-time researchers working on
home computers in assorted cities who, on average, have 12
years' experience in data-base research. Because of
consulting work, he adds, they've learned a lot about
marketing, advertising, public relations and sales.
   IQ promises to work faster than corporate libraries -- an
offer some busy managers can't pass up after waiting a week
or more for results from in-house searches. And IQ promises
to weed out irrelevant information turned up by searches, so
as not to waste readers' time.
   IQ's pace impressed ad executive Richard Hill, who at the
time was manager of McCann Erickson Worldwide Inc.'s Boston
office. Mr. Hill recalls that McCann's New York library
usually had a week's backlog of work. So to prepare more
quickly for one crucial meeting, Mr. Hill turned to IQ. The
result: He got the information in 36 hours and now credits IQ
with helping McCann win a new account.
   IQ hopes during the next five years to extend its customer
base, now mostly advertising and public-relations agencies,
to health-care companies, retailers and financial-services
firms. To familiarize people with its service and break down
resistance, IQ says it will depend heavily on direct-mail
promotions and phone marketing.
   Meanwhile, cost-cutting efforts by some big companies
might help IQ because inhouse libraries might be slimmed or
eliminated. Says Mr. Manshel, "The opportunity for an
information agency is great."

   NEW YORK -- Planned Parenthood Federation of America asked
the public to write letters to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. expressing outrage at the company's withdrawal of funding
after pressure from anti-abortion groups.
   In a statement, Planned Parenthood Foundation President
Faye Wattleton called AT&amp;T's decision "a capitulation to
those groups who go to extreme lengths to repress, undermine,
even abolish the free flow of information."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition to the letter-writing campaign, Ms. Wattleton
has urged supporters to donate their AT&amp;T securities to the
foundation so that it will have more voting influence on the
company's policies. She also canceled a $350,000 contract for
an AT&amp;T phone system.
   "We don't see it as AT&amp;T's role to take a position one way
or another on this very personal matter and we won't be
pushed into doing so by an intemperate publicity campaign,"
said an AT&amp;T spokesman.
   AT&amp;T had been one of Planned Parenthood's biggest
corporate sponsors, contributing about $50,000 annually. It
has come under increasing pressure from anti-abortion
activists to withdraw funding from groups that advocate
abortion. A shareholder resolution, calling for such action,
is scheduled for a vote at the company's annual meeting on
April 18.
   AT&amp;T has urged holders to reject the resolution, but it
recently pulled its funds, saying it didn't want to get drawn
into the foundation's battle with anti-abortion groups.

   Calpers' Chief Wields Big Stick
   For Institutional Shareholders

   NEW YORK -- As chief of the $56 billion California Public
Employees Retirement System, the U.S.'s largest pension fund
for civil servants, Dale M. Hanson is giving a lot of
corporate executives sleepless nights.
   The 47-year-old Mr. Hanson has made one thrust after
another into boardrooms across the U.S., prodding companies
to pay more attention to their giant shareholders. Just last
week Calpers took a highly publicized stand in proxy voting
against the management of Lockheed Corp., even though the
aerospace company agreed to add as many as three board seats
for big institutional investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Two or three years from now," Mr. Hanson says, "hopefully
what we're raising today won't need to be raised -- because
the law of the land or the unwritten law of the land will be
that directors on corporate boards are fiduciaries
representing the interests of shareholders."
   The more Mr. Hanson presses ahead, the more his critics
carp about the dangers of concentrating too much firepower in
the hands of pension funds.
   "I have serious questions about whether the {proxy} voting
responsibility is properly vested" with fund officials such
as Mr. Hanson, says John Wilcox of the proxy solicitation
firm Georgeson &amp; Co. "He's not really an owner."
   Even so, Mr. Hanson isn't likely to go away, although he
complains that shareholder-rights matters are taking "too
much of my time" (about 20% of his 65-hour workweek). He and
other officials of the 700-person Calpers staff are "willing
to take the heat from being out there in front," says Peg
O'Hara, head of the corporate governance services for the
Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington.
   And there's plenty of heat, even inside Mr. Hanson's own
domain at Calpers, which he joined in 1987. "I personally
feel that management of companies should be the prerogative
of management," says Jack Wickware, a lawyer for Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co. who was recently named to the Calpers
board.
   The powerful Calpers board, evenly split between labor and
employer members with one added trustee named by the
California Legislature, decided several years ago to take an
activist bent on shareholder rights. In the mid-1980s, the
state's then treasurer, the late Jesse Unruh, became irate at
the "greenmail" companies were paying to buy back their stock
from raiders -- a practice of no benefit to Calpers and other
shareholders.
   The board later fired its top administrator and hired Mr.
Hanson, who had spent 20 years working his way up to the No.
2 spot in the Wisconsin retirement system, as the first
executive from outside Calpers to head the California system.
Although Mr. Hanson didn't bring shareholder activism to
California, "he quickly discovered it was the most exciting
part of the job," a colleague says.
   Being willing to take the heat -- and pay the expenses
connected with shareholder activism -- has gained Calpers at
least a symbolic role in the affairs of a fast-growing list
of companies.
   A breakthrough occurred early last year when Texaco Inc.,
rewarding Calpers for opposing raider Carl Icahn's proxy
fight with the oil company, named a director from among
candidates compiled by Calpers. The director didn't promise
Calpers anything, but the fund still could claim some
tangible action by a major company. Calpers also has
sponsored dozens of other shareholder rights proxy
resolutions, proposed a massive overhaul of the proxy voting
system and targeted General Motors Corp., UAL Inc. and
Occidental Petroleum Corp., another big California-based
company, for criticism on various grounds.
   There's no question that corporate America is eager to
listen to Mr. Hanson's views. Just take a look at his
appointment book for last week.
   It began in Detroit, with a Monday tour of GM's Technical
Center at the invitation of GM Chairman Roger Smith, followed
by lunch with Mr. Smith. On Tuesday, Mr. Hanson was slated to
rub shoulders with the chief executives of General Mills,
Texaco and Champion International, among others, at
Champion's Treetops company retreat in Connecticut.
   On Wednesday, there was a lunch with General Electric
Co.'s Chairman Jack Welch at his invitation; Thursday it was
back to New York for investment discussions at Salomon
Brothers before flying home. Friday he was in Sacramento,
Calif., for a single day in the office, before he flew to
Washington on Sunday for a week of lobbying and conferences.
   Such a star-studded schedule is hardly typical for a
public servant, but it is becoming routine for Mr. Hanson,
who has become the most visible activist for funds nationwide
as they flex their $2.2 trillion in financial muscle.
   Mr. Hanson maintains that Calpers' 866,000 beneficiaries
have few investment options other than to buy and hold stocks
for decades. Funds don't want to run companies, he says, but
as long-term owners, they do want periodic contact with
directors. "It's the care and feeding of stockholders; if a
company has large stockholders, it's much better to know
them" before problems arise, he says.
   But while a strong believer in that message, Mr. Hanson
says he is the accidental activist, taking up the role on
orders from his 13-member board of trustees that decides
policy for the Calpers system. "If you told me that I would
be doing this corporate governance activity, I think I would
have looked at you in disbelief," Mr. Hanson says of his
expectations on joining Calpers.
   Mr. Hanson has been adept at winning backing from a
majority of the Calpers board for his proxy-season game plan,
giving him a largely free hand to try to wring out
concessions from companies. "He reads the board's tea leaves
very well," says Greta Marshall, now an outside money
manager, who worked with Mr. Hanson while she was Calpers'
chief investment officer. "That's to his great credit."
   For example, after winning a vague promise from Texaco
Chief Executive James Kinnear in mid-1988 on a role for big
institutions in picking a director, months passed without
further action. By November, Mr. Hanson was ready for a
showdown with Texaco, but went back to his trustees first.
   "I said I want a gut check," Mr. Hanson recalls telling
the trustees. "This is what I want to push for, but I don't
want to push for it if you're not behind me. They said you're
the closest to it, so go for it." Mr. Hanson filed a proxy
resolution to form a shareholders advisory committee and set
a December deadline for Texaco to act; the company agreed to
a nominee from Calpers' list in January and Calpers dropped
its threatened proxy squabble.
   "I have a very warm spot in my heart for Texaco," Mr.
Hanson now says. He adds of Mr. Kinnear, "He was really the
first corporate CEO that I had any exposure to, and that
relationship has kind of evolved" to include meetings such as
those at Treetops, where Messrs. Hanson and Kinnear have meet
twice in recent months with others on both sides to discuss
shareholder rights matters.
   Such meetings have helped cool the fighting rhetoric
between companies and Calpers. "There are things Dale is
doing that I would like to talk him out of, but that is
between him and me," says attorney Ira M. Millstein, a
Treetops attendee whose clients include the Business
Roundtable made up of corporate heavyweights.

   Network Equipment
   Says Quarter's Results
   Trailed Expectations

   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Network Equipment Technologies
Inc. saw its stock tumble 21% following its announcement that
fiscal fourth-quarter results were less than expected.
   The maker of communication networks closed yesterday at
$23.50, down $6.375, in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading
of almost 1.8 million shares. Analysts termed the price
plunge an overreaction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said its report of net income for the fourth
quarter, ended Saturday, could be less than the $4.6 million,
or 33 cents a share, posted a year earlier. Revenue, it's
estimated, was more than the $38.8 million posted a year
earlier, though lower than the $52 million reported in the
third quarter.
   Network blamed the expected lower results on a
greater-than-anticipated reduction in sales through
International Business Machines Corp., and a failure to
receive confirmation of certain orders at the end of the
quarter.
   Michel Guite, telecommunications analyst at Salomon
Brothers, said recent disappointing earnings in the
technology industry, including unexpected flat results from
Oracle Systems Corp., have caused investors to overreact.
Oracle, a fast-growing software concern, posted a 1.3% rise
in net last week, a sharp contrast to past quarters of
booming growth. That sent the company's stock plunging 31%.
   Mr. Guite has cut his earnings estimate for Network's
fourth quarter to 31 cents a share, from 39 cents, and cut
revenue estimates to $43 million, from $51.7 million. Though
he believes Network remains "sound," he has cut his revenue
estimates for the current year to $210 million, from $230
million because of concern over the declining revenue from
IBM.
   "The company's fundamentals are outstanding," said George
Kelly, analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It's a well-managed
company operating in a strong market."
   Network's stock has been gaining steadily since late 1988,
when it was trading at $18 a share. Recently, it had been
trading as high as $34.375.
   Network sells products that create private networks of
computers and phones. In 1987, the company signed an
agreement with IBM, under which IBM sells certain Network
products world-wide and funds some product development.

   N.V. Amev, the third-largest Dutch insurance company, and
Groupe AG, Belgium's biggest insurer, announced plans to
merge, creating Europe's 12th-largest insurer in terms of
premium income. A final pact is expected before year end.
   Amev and Groupe each would own 50% of a joint venture,
with operating units initially separate, designed to
strengthen both as the European Community moves toward freer
cross-border competition. Groupe would pay 10.7 billion
Belgian francs ($305.3 million) to Amev over 10 years to
cover the difference in Amev's greater value. The two
parents, which also have moved into banking, would keep
separate stock market quotations.

   The combined companies would have annual revenue of about
$7 billion, assets of $35 billion, and shareholders' equity,
including unrealized gains on assets, of $4 billion. They
have a combined stock market value of about $4.6 billion.
   Amev posted a 28% rise in 1989 profit to 354.8 million

   Great Western Financial Corp. said its main unit's
previously reported agreement to buy branches of CenTrust
Savings Bank for $150 million fell through.
   Great Western said the agreement, reached last summer,
included clauses that allowed either side to kill the deal if
it hadn't been concluded by March 31. It said it allowed the
agreement to lapse.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The collapse of the deal came as no surprise and had been
foreordained by CenTrust's recent seizure by the government.
CenTrust, hurt by huge junk-bond losses and by the
free-spending ways of its controversial former chairman,
David L. Paul, failed last month. Officials have estimated
that its demise may ultimately cost the government $2 billion
to $3 billion.
   Under the proposed transaction, Great Western was to have
bought the deposits, offices and related assets of 63
branches of Miami-based CenTrust, which by the time the
agreement was announced already was the focus of increasing
regulatory concern. Great Western has headquarters in Beverly
Hills, Calif.

   Torchmark Ends American General Bid,
   Plans to Run Board Slate in Proxy Fight

   Torchmark Corp., blocked in a course it set only a week
ago, dropped its $50-a-share, or $6.3 billion, unsolicited
bid for rival American General Corp. and proposed its own
slate of five nominees for American General's board.
   The move by the Birmingham, Ala., insurer, coupled with
battles already emerging in court and in insurance
regulators' offices, indicated that the fight for control of
American General could be a long and messy affair, industry
observers said. "This thing is a legal morass," said one
takeover-stock trader.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Torchmark said it was withdrawing its offer because it
hadn't received any response from American General in the
48hour period set by Torchmark when it first made its bid in
a March 26 letter.
   Torchmark "had a proposal on the table, and {American
General} wouldn't even look at it," said Jon W. Rotenstreich,
Torchmark president. "We're telling the shareholders that we
will go back to the table with a different board. One with a
resolution to do what's best for {shareholders}."
   Torchmark said it will propose its own slate of five
independent board nominees at American General's May 2 annual
meeting. Torchmark said it will also propose a resolution for
the board to appoint a committee of independent directors "to
evaluate all acquisition proposals and hire an investment
banking firm to solicit offers to acquire the company."
   American General, however, accused Torchmark of not acting
in good faith. Torchmark's latest move, said Harold S. Hook,
chairman and chief executive officer of American General,
"forces us to conclude that Torchmark didn't make its
acquisition proposal in good faith to begin with; that the
proposal was made and then withdrawn solely to provide an
excuse for a proxy fight." Mr. Hook added that American
General did respond within the 48hour period by scheduling to
consider the proposal at its next regularly scheduled board
meeting.
   The Houston-based insurer repeated its earlier statement
that Torchmark's proposal hadn't been received by the 60-day
deadline for nominating directors, according to its bylaws.
American General said it also plans to "vigorously pursue" a
lawsuit, filed last week, seeking a declaratory judgment
upholding the bylaw provision.
   American General's board made a resolution in February to
increase the size of its board to 15 directors from 13 at the
May 2 meeting. Six seats are up for election at the meeting.
Torchmark said yesterday that it had nominated only five
nominees in order to facilitate the re-election of Mr. Hook
to the board.
   News of the companies' moves further battered American
General's stock, which hit a high of $40.125 a share last
week, when Torchmark's offer was disclosed. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, American General closed
at $36.75, down $1.875, while Torchmark closed at $45.50,
down 25 cents.
   Beyond the battle over bylaws and deadlines,
takeover-stock traders said Torchmark faces another hurdle.
According to Texas law, any change of control of a Texas
insurance company must first be approved by the state
insurance commissioner. And a spokesman for the Texas State
Board of Insurance said that the staff of the board's
holding-company section is taking the position that the
commissioner must approve the change "before proxies are
solicited."
   The approval process in Texas is quite cumbersome. First,
a potential acquirer must submit a detailed application to
the state insurance commissioner, outlining its plans for the
new entity. Within 30 days of receiving a complete
application, the commissioner must schedule a public hearing,
after which he makes his decision. A spokesman for the Texas
State Board of Insurance said Torchmark hasn't even submitted
an application yet.
   Torchmark may still have an out or two. For starters, the
staff director who made the decision about the proxy fight
has asked the legal department for a second opinion. But
chances of a reversal don't look good. The insurance board
ruled that B.A.T Industries PLC would have to get the Texas
commissioner's approval before seeking proxies in its battle
for Farmers Insurance.
   Second, Torchmark, according to some traders, apparently
will argue that because it is nominating an independent slate
of directors, the proxy fight doesn't constitute an attempt
by Torchmark to seek control.

   Simmons Lets
   Georgia Gulf
   Offer Expire

   Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons, in an about-face, said
he let his $45 a share, or $1 billion, tender offer for
Georgia Gulf Corp. expire yesterday and now plans to support
Georgia Gulf's recapitalization plan.
   The investor and NL Industries Inc., a Houston chemicals
concern that he controls, said they made the decision after
Georgia Gulf's management two weeks ago restructured its plan
to offer cash and new securities for current shares, and the
Atlanta company's stock price climbed about 10%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, the move may fuel criticism that the investor,
who just last week led a proxy fight to oust the board of
Lockheed Corp., simply was trying to push Georgia Gulf's
management to sweeten its offer to protect his investment in
the company. When he began the tender offer in February,
Georgia Gulf's stock was trading at about $36 a share, below
Mr. Simmons's average purchase price of about $37 a share for
his 2.3 million Georgia Gulf shares, or 9.6% stake.
   Both Mr. Simmons and Georgia Gulf have had difficulty
getting financing for their respective offers, with Mr.
Simmons planning to finance his buy-out largely with bank
debt and Georgia Gulf hoping to raise about $200 million in
the troubled junk bond market.
   In mid-March, Georgia Gulf amended its plan to offer
shareholders $30 cash, $8.50 face amount of a new issue of
15% senior subordinated notes due in 2000 and one new share
of common stock for each common share currently outstanding.
The plan reduced the cash paid to shareholders and paid the
new debt directly to shareholders, eliminating the need to
turn to skittish junk-bond investors. Georgia Gulf valued the
offer at $49.50 a share, and its stock climbed from about $40
a share to close yesterday at $44.50 a share, down 37.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Meanwhile, Michael Snetzer, president of Mr. Simmons's
holding company, Valhi Inc., said that Mr. Simmons had "more
than one proposal" for bank financing and could have lined up
the $800 million needed for his offer. But Mr. Snetzer said
that Mr. Simmons didn't want to raise his offer from $45 a
share and didn't want to pay a 2.5% to 3.5% fee for bank
financing if Georgia Gulf's offer was at least as good as
his.
   "We've evaluated the second offer and believe it will
deliver" at least $45 a share, Mr. Snetzer said. However, he
said that Mr. Simmons and NL may consider making another
offer if the recapitalization plan isn't approved by Georgia
Gulf's stockholders at its April 19 shareholders meeting and
isn't completed promptly.
   NL also said that it will allow a consent solicitation to
remove Georiga Gulf's directors to expire on April 6 without
taking any action.
   In Atlanta, officials of Georgia Gulf, a chemicals
concern, didn't have any comment on Mr. Simmons's move.
   Last week, Mr. Simmons, who owns 18.9% of Lockheed Corp.,
led a proxy battle to replace Lockheed's board with his own
nominees and to force the big defense company to adopt a
number of shareholder-rights initiatives. Although the final
vote isn't expected until April 16, Lockheed officials said
they believe their candidates won. Mr. Simmons has said he
believes the vote will be close and says he believes he won
on the shareholder-rights proposals.
   As with Georgia Gulf, critics charged that the Dallas
investor began the fight with Lockheed to boost the share
price. Mr. Simmons purchased his stock at an average of $44 a
share, while Lockheed's stock closed yesterday at $36.125, up
12.5 cents, in Big Board trading.

   `Ninja Turtle' Juggernaut Demolishes Box Office Record

   NEW YORK -- Cowabunga]
   "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," the movie based on the
comic book and wildly successful animated TV series, grossed
approximately $25.4 million in its first weekend at the box
office, making it the largest non-summer, non-Thanksgiving
weekend opening of a movie ever, according to the trade
newspaper Daily Variety. That shattered the previous record
set by "The Hunt for Red October," which grossed $17.2
million its first weekend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The movie is only the latest success for the four turtles
who, as the story goes, were deposited into a manhole, doused
with radioactive goo and grew to human-sized superheroes with
such expressions as "Surf's up]" "Cowabunga]" and "Let's
party, dude."
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are already an industry unto
themselves. Last year, for instance, the Turtles earned more
than $350 million in license fees and merchandising, double
the 1988 earnings. This year, that figure will be "at least,
easily doubled," says Jim Prindle, director of licensing and
merchandising at Mirage Studios, a Northampton, Mass.-based
partnership of the comic's creators, Peter Laird, 36 years
old, and Kevin Eastman, 27. Messrs. Laird and Eastman
couldn't be reached yesterday.
   More than 100 manufacturers hold licensing agreements to
put the creatures on everything from Burger King posters to
McCain Ellio's Foods Inc. frozen pizzas. They also appear as
action-figure toys and on T-shirts.
   The success of the movie is also buoying the fortunes of
New Line Cinema Corp., the film's domestic distributor, whose
other projects include another mutant of sorts, Freddy
Kreuger of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series. "We have to
have the nostrils for smelling the good stuff," says Robert
Shaye, New Line's president. New Line is also benefiting from
the recently released film, "House Party," which the company
produced for $2.5 million and which so far has grossed $16.4
million. New Line Cinema's shares rose 37.5 cents to $11.25
yesterday in composite trading on the American Stock
Exchange.
   "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," which cost about $12
million to make, was financed and produced by Golden Harvest
Films, a unit of Golden Communications Co. Ltd., based in
Hong Kong. Dennis McAlpine, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.,
figures Golden Harvest stands to clear about $18 million from
its share of domestic revenue of the film if the movie
grosses $100 million, and the company also has foreign
distribution rights. New York-based New Line bought the
domestic theatrical rights for about $3 million.
   The movie -- which received mixed reviews -- is only the
latest vehicle for the Turtles, who are named after four
Renaissance artists: Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and
Donatello. There will, of course, be a sequel. In September,
a live stage show will make its debut at New York's Radio
City Music Hall. And recently, Burger King began selling
videotapes of episodes of the TV show "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles."
   These tapes, distributed by Family Home Entertainment, a
subsidiary of Live Entertainment Inc., contain a 2 1/2-minute
commercial promoting various Turtle merchandise, including
the movie. Family Home distributes other tapes of the TV show
in the home-video marketplace and said it has sold over three
million of the videotapes. Live Entertainment also bought the
domestic home-video rights to the movie for about $5 million.
Live Entertainment's stock jumped $2.50 to $19.25 in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   Just what is it that makes four talking turtles so
appealing?
   "They have a sense of humor," says Mark Freedman,
licensing agent for the creatures and president of Surge
Licensing Inc., a company based on Long Island in New York.
"They're like the Bruce Willis character in `Moonlighting.'
They talk directly to the audience, and they don't take
themselves too seriously."
   Four years ago, Mr. Freedman was a "marketing consultant"
when he says he happened upon the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles -- then simply comic book characters. He approached
Messrs. Laird and Eastman about a marketing deal. "The toy
industry was looking for a breakthrough item and I had a
feeling this would be it," Mr. Freedman says.
   Another draw, says Mr. Freedman, 35, is that "parents
don't get it."
   The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created in 1983 for
a black-and-white comic book. According to Cheryl Prindle,
executive director at Mirage Studios, there are 28 volumes
and over four million copies of the comic books in print.
   Some of Mr. Laird's other illustrations were published in
a small comic book titled "Scat" when Mr. Eastman, an amateur
cartoonist then working as a short-order cook, noticed a copy
of the comic book left on a Northampton bus.
   Mr. Eastman took samples of his work to "Scat," whose
editor suggested he team up with Mr. Laird. "It was instant
friendship," Ms. Prindle says. It was Mr. Eastman whose
brainchild was the large turtle donning a ninja mask and
weapon, which he called "Ninja Turtles." Mr. Laird came up
with the full name.
   The TV series is responsible for the playful jargon as
well as a song that calls the turtles "heroes on the
half-shell."
   The movie, complete with the turtles tossing into the air
their favorite food, pizza, and slicing it with their katana
sword blades, features the work of Jim Henson's Creature
Shop, based in London.
   Says Mr. Freedman, "I knew this would either bomb or be
the biggest hit."

   Havas S.A., a French media, travel and advertising group,
said it entered into an asset swap with Bollore Technologies
S.A. of France that will make Havas Europe's leading travel
agency concern.
   The deal calls for Havas's tourism subsidiary Havas
Tourisme to acquire Bollore's SCAC Voyages unit for about 150
million francs ($26.3 million). At the same time, Havas
Tourisme will acquire a 10% shareholding in Diners Club de
France, the French arm of the U.S. credit-card concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In exchange, Bollore will become a shareholder of Havas
Tourisme with a 10% stake, alongside Havas with a 65%
interest (reduced from 75%) and the Bouygues S.A.
construction group with 25%.
   Havas said the asset swap will expand the number of Havas
travel agencies throughout Europe to 500, making it the
largest network in Europe, with annual sales of more than 10
billion francs.
   Bollore said it intends to refocus its activities on its
industrial, transportation and distribution businesses.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. plans to open talks with Moscow
that could lead to Soviet participation in a costly and
complex program to send astronauts to the moon and on to
Mars.
   Similar talks also are planned with Western allies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A joint Soviet-U.S. mission to Mars has long been a goal
of many U.S. space officials, who say it would lead to
greater cooperation between the two superpowers. But critics
of space cooperation say the U.S. risks giving up advanced
technology. Moreover, regardless of who participates in such
ventures, a mission to Mars would face congressional
opposition because of its huge costs.
   Since July 1975, when the U.S. and Soviet Union docked
manned rockets in space, cooperation has been limited mainly
to sharing information on weather and the medical effects of
weightlessness on crews.
   Any new U.S.-Soviet venture is still far off. A White
House statement said the talks will focus "on conceptual
possibilities" for cooperation. Apart from the Soviets, the
U.S. will try to set up talks with Western Europe, Canada and
Japan.
   The statement said international cooperation "could offer
significant benefits" to the U.S., but didn't say what they
are. In the past, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has sought international partners to build
political support for a project and to share expenses.
Europe, Canada and Japan are expected to spend about $8
billion to build parts of a manned space station; the U.S.
will spend about $30 billion on the project.
   Manned missions to the moon and Mars could be the most
expensive project in history. NASA has estimated the cost, in
1991 dollars, at between $471 billion and $541 billion over
35 years. For the current fiscal year, the Bush
administration is asking for $188 million to develop
technology for manned expeditions to the moon and Mars.
   NASA Administrator Richard Truly recently testified in
Congress that those costs could grow to between $445 million
and $1.7 billion the following year, depending on how fast
the project is pursued. Preliminary plans call for a return
to the moon near the turn of the century, and a trip to Mars
15 to 20 years later.
   It's doubtful that Congress would go along with big budget
requests for exploration. Rep. Bob Traxler, (D., Mich.), who
chairs the House appropriations panel overseeing NASA, hinted
that Congress might cut about $1 billion from NASA's budget
request of $15.2 billion for the year beginning next Oct. 1.
Funding for the Bush exploration initiative would probably be
slashed as part of those cuts.

   Short Bill Drafted
   To Allay Problem
   On Thrift Nominee

   WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
outlined quick, narrow legislation that would undercut one of
the Bush administration's most compelling arguments for
quickly confirming Timothy Ryan as top thrift regulator.
   Mr. Ryan, a Washington labor and pension lawyer, was
nominated last month to be director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision. The Senate Banking Committee approved the
nomination by an 11-10 vote last week and sent it to the full
Senate for consideration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some senators have complained that Mr. Ryan lacks
financial experience, but the administration has argued that
the nominee must be confirmed quickly. A federal court ruling
could bring the savings-and-loan restructuring to a halt
unless the Senate promptly confirms a new director for the
thrift office. An appeals court stay has put the federal
court ruling on hold until April 11.
   Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have drafted a
one-page bill that would give the president the authority to
appoint a temporary replacement. Sen. Donald Riegle (D.,
Mich.) outlined the proposal as one option that may be
pursued. The bill would allow the president to name a
temporary director under procedures that would pass muster
with the court, and the administration would have more time
to seek another candidate for the full five-year term.
   The administration also has argued that Mr. Ryan's
financial background isn't as important as his record as an
able administrator and strong enforcer during his time with
the Labor Department. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has
asked the Senate to "trust his judgment" on his selection of
Mr. Ryan and continued calling on senators to push for the
nominee.
   The narrow basis of the court case hanging over the thrift
bailout was that Danny Wall, director of the thrift office
until late February, wasn't approved for his post under
constitutional provisions. When he resigned, therefore, the
administration didn't have standing under the Vacancies Act
to appoint a temporary replacement.
   A floor vote this week appears likely, the administration
and Senate Democrats said. The legislation that Sen. Riegle
discussed wouldn't necessarily have to be approved before the
vote, a committee staff member said, as long as senators knew
the bill was in the offing.
   Sen. Riegle has hammered away that Mr. Ryan lacks the
background necessary for the job at a time of crisis in the
thrift industry. In a speech to the Independent Bankers
Association of America, Sen. Riegle said he was unhappy about
the choice for the "single most important financial position
today," adding that he believes Mr. Ryan would be unqualified
to be chief executive officer of any of the small banks the
trade group represents.
   Disclosures during the weekend that Mr. Ryan briefly tried
marijuana and cocaine in the early 1970s won't help the
nominee but aren't likely to be as important a factor in the
Senate deliberations, congressional sources said.

   SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. named President John
L. Youngblood to the additional posts of chairman and chief
executive officer, and a member of the executive committee,
at a special meeting of the board.
   Mr. Youngblood, 49 years old, was also chief operating
officer. As chairman and chief executive, he succeeds James
E. Swiggett, 58, who is retiring for "personal reasons," the
company said. Mr. Swiggett will remain a director and member
of the executive committee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Kollmorgen said Mr. Youngblood's
appointment was part of a restructuring plan announced in
September. The spokesman said Mr. Swiggett "grew up in the
interconnections business," the printed circuit board
business that is being sold as part of the restructuring
plan. Kollmorgen will be left with its motors and controls
and electro-optical business.
   Mr. Swiggett was chairman since 1989 and chief executive
since 1984. During his tenure, Kollmorgen was the subject of
a hostile tender offer from Vernitron Corp., a Deer Park,
N.Y., industrial electronics company that is closely held.
Although the companies later agreed to a friendly merger,
Vernitron pulled out of the $320 million transaction in
September, a week before it was to close. Kollmorgen sued,
and Vernitron countersued. The companies are still involved
in litigation.
   Mr. Youngblood earlier had been president of the
electro-optical division. He holds a doctorate in electrical
engineering.
   In addition, Kollmorgen elected Robert N. Parker,
president of LTV Corp.'s missiles and electronics group, a
director, increasing the board to 13 members.

   Two Retail Units
   Of Campeau Post
   Losses for 4 Weeks

   NEW YORK -- Federated Stores Inc. said its Federated and
Allied retailing units incurred losses totaling $45.8 million
for the four weeks ended March 3. The figure excludes the
costs of filing for Chapter 11 status.
   The Campeau Corp. unit said the performance "exceeded its
expectations" for the first complete month of operation since
filing Jan. 15 for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Federated didn't provide financial results for
February 1989, so a direct comparison couldn't be made
independently.
   Federated Stores Inc. was formerly known as Campeau
(U.S.). Late last week, Federated filed for Chapter 11
status, calling the filing a "procedural step" as part of its
reorganization plan. Federated Stores remains fully owned by
Campeau, based in Toronto.
   The Federated Department Stores Inc. division incurred
losses of $29.9 million on revenue of $277 million. Its
outlets include Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Strauss, Burdines,
Lazarus and Rich's/Goldsmith's.
   The Allied Stores Corp. division had a loss of $15.9
million on revenue of $156.7 million. Its stores include Bon
Marche, Jordan Marsh, Maas Brothers/Jordan Marsh, and
Stern's.
   Although February wasn't profitable for Federated Stores,
it was a marked improvement compared with the losses incurred
for the 20 days ended Feb. 3, 1990. In that period, Federated
had a loss of $37 million on revenue of $158.6 million; the
Allied unit posted losses of $19 million on $77.3 million of
revenue.
   Altogether, the Allied and Federated units have incurred
losses of $101.8 million since filing for Chapter 11 status.
"Half of that loss is interest expense being accrued by the
companies at the same rate as was paid in the pre-petition
period," said a Federated Stores representative.
   "It's a lot of money to lose in such a short period," said
Howard Bloom, president of Chetta B. Inc., a women's apparel
maker. "We are shipping to them, however, and I would like to
continue doing business with them."
   Other manufacturers, as well as one important factoring
company, also expressed support for the Allied and Federated
units.
   "February is generally a weak retailing period," said
Frank DeRita, senior vice president, Congress Talcott Corp.,
a major factoring company. "There is a relative safety net
because they have enough cash on hand to meet trade
obligations in April and beyond. Considering the filing, and
this period in the retail cycle, this is to be expected."
Factors buy retail payables from manufacturers at a discount,
thus providing them with cash.
   "It's fairly normal to show losses like this in a
restructuring," added Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller
Ltd., a women's apparel supplier. "What we want to know is
whether the bleeding has stopped. If this performance means
they've cleaned up their inventory, that's fine. The history
of retailers coming out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings
isn't great."
   Federated Stores said that it ended the February selling
period with "stocks in better shape" than anticipated.

   Canadian Bank
   Sells 50% Stake
   In Australia Bank

   TORONTO -- Royal Bank of Canada sold its 50% stake in its
Australian bank for 200 million Australian dollars (US$150
million) in the first part of a A$3.4 billion merger (US$2.6
billion) between a big bank and an insurance concern in
Australia.
   Royal Bank retreated from full-service retail banking in
Australia by selling its half-interest in National Mutual
Royal Bank Ltd. to Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group, or
ANZ. National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd.,
Royal Bank's joint-venture partner in the 130-branch bank,
also sold its stake to ANZ. Total proceeds for the
transactions were A$400 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sale of the bank was the first leg of a proposed
merger in which ANZ will pay A$3.4 billion for a 51% stake in
National Mutual Life. The merger, if accepted by shareholders
and policyholders and approved by the Australian government,
would create Australia's largest financial-services concern,
said David Trude, analyst at First Boston Corp. It also would
protect ANZ from a raid by its competitors, who are mainly
Westpac Banking Corp. and National Australia Bank Ltd., of
Melbourne, he said. ANZ said the merged entity will have A$91
billion of group assets and A$39 billion under management.
   National Mutual Life policyholders will be asked to
approve the merger with ANZ on May 29, with combined
operations set to begin on Oct. 1. Following the merger, ANZ
will ask its shareholders to change its name to ANZ-NM
Banking and Insurance Group Ltd. ANZ is a large banking and
financial services group and National Mutual Life is
Australia's second-largest life insurance concern. Both are
based in Melbourne.
   In a statement, Australian government Treasurer Paul
Keating said he approved in principal ANZ's acquisition of
National Mutual Royal Bank, but said he would consider
various policy issues regarding the union of ANZ and National
Mutual Life. It is likely that Mr. Keating will approve the
ANZ-National Mutual Life merger because the two concerns
don't operate to a significant degree in the same businesses,
Mr. Trude said.
   Mr. Keating said that in the event the merger doesn't go
ahead, ownership of National Mutual Royal Bank will revert to
National Mutual Life.
   Although National Mutual Royal Bank "exceeded
expectations" on performance, Toronto-based Royal Bank said
it sold its interest in the bank to accommodate its
joint-venture partner.
   "I would think that they are happy to get out of there,"
said First Boston's Mr. Trude, adding that foreign banks
created when the Australian government granted 16 new banking
licenses in 1985 have faced tough competition from Australian
domestic banks. He noted that National Mutual Royal Bank was
one of the more successful new entrants in the deregulated
Australian banking sector.
   A spokesman for Royal Bank said the bank had invested
about A$140 million of capital in National Mutual Royal Bank.
He said Royal Bank's focus in recent years has been to
withdraw from retail full-service banking outside of Canada,
except in parts of the Caribbean, and to focus instead on
corporate banking.

   Are Going Organic

   ECOLOGICALLY correct yard-care products and services are
springing up like weeds.
   Only about 1% of pesticides are put on lawns, but they
raise special concerns. Children play the most on grass, and
they're "the subgroup of the population most susceptible" to
toxins, notes Susan Cooper, an ecologist with the National
Coalition Against Misuse of Pesticides, an environmental
group. Last week, the U.S. General Accounting Office
underscored concerns by charging that the lawn-care industry
exaggerates pesticide safety.
   Organic offerings include everything from books, such as
"The Chemical-Free Lawn," published last year by Rodale
Press, to rapidly biodegradable pesticides. Rincon-Vitova
Insectories Inc., Oak View, Calif., says its aphid-eating
ladybugs and other insect stand-ins for chemicals are flying
off the shelf.
   NaturaLawn Inc., a Damascus, Md., organic lawn-care
concern, "had to {temporarily} cut off sales last year
because we couldn't handle all the business we were getting,"
says Phil Catron, president. NaturaLawn occasionally uses
chemical herbicide on some tenacious weeds, Mr. Catron says.
But part of the organic approach, he adds, "is educating
people that having a few weeds is not that big a deal."
   Mainstream yard-care concerns also are getting into the
act.
   ChemLawn Services Corp., Columbus, Ohio, says it's
test-marketing a program that uses manure for fertilizer and
no pesticides. Bartlett Tree Experts Co., Stamford, Conn.,
offers an option featuring precisely timed spraying and
pest-attacking insects. The method cuts chemical use by more
than 90%, says Donald Booth, a Bartlett manager.

   Enlisting a Clay Pit
   To Store Solar Energy
                                                                                                       

   ENGINEERS at the University of Massachusetts are planning
a solar energy system based on clay.
   The team plans to capture heat from the sun during the
summer with solar collectors and use it to warm a
100-foot-deep clay deposit near the school's Amherst, Mass.,
campus. In winter, the stored energy would provide as much as
80% of the heating for a new convention center near campus.
   The technique, which could overcome the difficulty of
storing solar energy, was explored by the the U.S. Department
of Energy in the 1970s as a way to heat homes, says team
leader Edward Sunderland. But heat leaked out of the
relatively small systems too fast. The Amherst system's much
larger 100,000-cubic-meter clay deposit is expected to retain
and give back more than 85% of its stored heat, says team
member Dwayne Breger.
   The system would employ six acres of solar collectors
similar to rooftop water heaters. The collectors would heat
water, which would be pumped through underground pipes lacing
the clay to warm it. In winter, the warm clay would heat
water to 140 degrees Fahrenheit before it is pumped to the
convention center.
   The system's estimated cost of about $3.5 million would be
repaid by fuel savings in five to seven years, Mr. Breger
projects. The engineers, whose design work was funded by the
DOE, now are seeking funds to build the system. It would be a
U.S. first, but some 30 such systems already have been built
in Europe, they say.
                                                                                                       

   Ecology Groups Waver
   Over Seals of Approval
                                                                                                       

   IT'S A FAUSTIAN dilemma that's shaping up for some
environmental groups.
   Many of them recently have been approached by retailers
and other concerns proposing to use the groups' names and
logos in product promotions. The companies are offering
royalties or other kinds of payment and a chance for the
groups to spread their messages among consumers. "Right now,
we're being deluged" with such proposals, says Rosemary
Carroll, the Sierra Club's director of development.
   Some groups already make such deals: The Audubon Society
licenses its name to makers of binoculars and birdseed. Black
Sheep Marketing Inc., New York, pays a 25% royalty to the
Rainforest Alliance to use its name in inserts with shower
curtains picturing rain forests. The World Wildlife Fund has
licensed its name to a maker of T-shirts featuring endangered
species.
   But other groups are wrestling with issues raised by the
proposals and haven't yet decided how to handle them. "Our
name could lose all meaning if we don't protect how it is
used," says Ms. Carroll of the Sierra Club, which is now
developing a policy on the matter. For example, she adds, the
group probably won't sign a pact with a company that wants to
promote its plastic-free tampons with the Sierra Club.
                                                                                                       

   Introducing the Annual
   `Green Con Award'
                                                                                                       

   THE LONDON OFFICE of Friends of the Earth has initiated an
annual "Green Con Award."
   The environmental group wants to spotlight examples of
"companies jumping on the green bandwagon when in fact they
are talking gibberish," says a Friends spokeswoman. The first
winner was British Nuclear Fuels PLC for "railing about how
green nuclear power is," she says.
   A British Nuclear spokesman says its recently developed ad
campaign stresses that nuclear plants, unlike conventional
plants, don't pollute the air. "We maintain nuclear power
could contribute to lessening the greenhouse effect," he
says.
   He added that "we don't agree with the criticism that we
are deceiving people. But we derived some amusement from the
award. We would have displayed the trophy in the press
office, but it's so hideous nobody wanted it."

   NEW YORK -- The mortgage-backed securities market received
another jab yesterday when Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said it may downgrade the credit rating on $26 billion of
securities issued by the nation's savings and loan
associations.
   Moody's said the possible action would involve the
mortgage-backed bonds and medium-term notes issued by all of
the nation's savings and loan associations -- those under
government conservatorship along with those that are
independent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moody's announcement follows similar action taken late
last month by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which said it may
lower the rating on $20 billion of debt issued by S&amp;Ls.
   Meanwhile, Treasury bonds ended little changed after a day
of quiet trading.
   The reviews by the nation's two largest credit rating
agencies were prompted by recent statements by Resolution
Trust Corp., the federal agency created to manage the savings
and loan bailout.
   Last month, following the seizure of Franklin Savings &amp;
Loan, the agency said it believes that under the thrift
industry restructuring law, it has the authority to stop
paying interest on fixed-income securities that were issued
by thrifts placed under RTC conservatorship -- even when the
securities are backed by collateral.
   If RTC decides to exercise such authority, "this may be
considered a default on the interest payments," said Raymond
McDaniel, an associate director at Moody's. "It is
potentially changing the original promise that investors
believed they were getting in the securities."
   Mr. McDaniel said that in a meeting with credit rating
agencies yesterday, RTC outlined five options concerning the
resolution of the interest-payment issue. Under the RTC
option most unfavorable to investors, Mr. McDaniel said they
would at the most lose one or more interest payments but not
the principal.
   Moody's said RTC's five options concerning interest
payments on thrift bonds were: No post-receivership interest;
government rate of interest from the date of receivership
until the date of repudiation with no interest until
collateral liquidation and payment to investors; government
rate of interest from the date of receivership until
collateral liquidation and payment to investors; payment at
the security's stated rate of interest until repudiation,
with a government rate of interest until liquidation; and
payment at the security's stated rate of interest until
liquidation (the regulatory practice before the thrift
bailout law).
   Mr. McDaniel said he expects RTC to make a decision within
two weeks.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds drifted lower yesterday, along with the
U.S. dollar, after a day of dull trading activity.
   At the start of yesterday's session, dealers expected
bonds to post modest gains in a follow-through from a rally
overseas that was triggered by falling Japanese stock prices.
The Nikkei index of the Tokyo stock market fell 1978.38
points, the second largest decline since the October 1987
stock market crash.
   As the Nikkei plunged, some investors sold stocks and
bought U.S. Treasury bonds. That lifted prices of the bonds
in Tokyo. But trading in the U.S. was quiet.
   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 98 17/32 to
yield 8.62% compared with 98 19/32 to yield 8.62% on Friday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 99 to yield
8.63% compared with 99 1/32 to yield 8.63% on Friday.
   Short-term rates were lower when compared to last week at
the U.S. government's regular weekly auction.
   The Treasury said that the average discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills was 7.83% yesterday and that the
average discount rate on six-month bills was 7.81%. The rates
were down from last week's auction when they were 7.85% and
7.83% respectively.
   The average rate on three-month bills was the lowest since
the average of 7.72% at the auction Feb. 26. The rate on
six-month bills was the lowest since the average of 7.79% at
the auction on March 5.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated April 5. The 13-week bills mature
July 5, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Oct. 4, 1990.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities were unchanged to up
slightly, with issues falling from highs earlier in the day
in thin trading.
   Among new issues, Citibank offered $210 million of
mortgage pass-through securities yesterday that are backed by
residential mortgage loans.
   The issue, which is expected to be rated triple-A by the
credit rating agencies, is guaranteed by Financial Security
Assurance.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Southland Corp. were little changed
despite late news that the firm posted a loss of $1.01
billion in the fourth quarter after a $947 million write-off
of good will.
   The Dallas-based convenience store operator said its most
recent internal forecasts show that it won't meet certain
financial covenants with its banks, which hold more than $1
billion of senior debt.
   The company also said it may be forced to seek
bankruptcy-law protection if it can't complete a
restructuring, which is contingent on Southland swapping
about $1.8 billion in public debt for stock and new zero
coupon bonds. So far, many bondholders have balked at terms
of the swap. Southland's 16 3/4% subordinated debentures, due
in 2002, were offered unchanged at 14 1/2. But there were no
bids for the securities. The company's 15 3/4% senior
subordinated notes, maturing in 1997, were also little
changed at 23 1/2.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Outperforming U.S. Treasury issues, municipal bonds were
flat to up 1/8 point in late dealings, with bonds showing
little price movement after gains posted earlier in the day.
   Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority
issue of 2018 was up 1/8 point at 97 3/8 to yield 7.42%,
which was 0.01 percentage point lower than that of late
Friday.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government bond market followed the yen
yesterday, opening weaker as the dollar traded as high as
160.30 yen but recovering as the yen rose.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the yield on the
benchmark No. 119 4.8% bond due in 1999 was at 7.355%. The
price was up 0.04 at 85.99.
   Dealers were mixed on whether the drop in the Nikkei stock
index of the Tokyo stock market was a bullish or bearish
factor.
   "There was talk of selling stock and buying bonds," said
one dealer. Other dealers, however, believe the weakness of
the stock market is bearish for the bond market.
   In other markets:
   -- West German bonds ended about 0.10 point firmer after
an early morning rally. Bonn's 7 3/4% benchmark issue due
2000 ended at 95.95 to yield 8.36%.
   -- British government gilts ended firmer in quiet trading
after a late-day rally.
   Bonds and sterling had been lower during the morning as
overseas investors reacted bearishly to reports of a riot
over the weekend in London. Violence erupted during a
demonstration Saturday over Britain's new system of local
taxation, the so-called community charge. But reaction was
more muted among local participants. Meanwhile, sterling
advanced against the mark, which bolstered sentiment in
government bonds. Britain's 11 3/4% Treasury bond due
2003-2007 rose 6/32 to 98 15/32 to yield 11.95%.

   Rumors of a broken engagement have been circulating for
months, but now it's official: Pearson PLC of Britain and
Elsevier N.V. of the Netherlands say they are no longer
discussing a merger.
   In September 1988, the two publishing companies announced
plans for cooperation and cross-shareholdings, saying they
might eventually merge. Pearson acquired 22% of Elsevier,
which in turn has a 9.4% stake in the British company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since then, the fall of the pound and a surge in
Elsevier's share price has made the Dutch company too
expensive for Pearson to contemplate, officials of the two
companies say. The option of merging the companies into a
50-50 joint venture would have been unacceptable to British
investors, an Elsevier spokesman said. Meanwhile, the
takeover threats that appeared to be a major reason for the
alliance have receded.
   The two sides haven't managed to find much scope for
cooperation. So far, the only project involves the use of
Pearson expertise for a small Elsevier unit offering Dutch
financial data via telephone lines.
   But the two companies remain friendly, a Pearson official
said. "We still regard Elsevier as our long-term European
partner," he said, adding that the two are talking about
combining certain ventures in medical publishing and may
collaborate on a new financial weekly that would be
distributed for free on the Continent.

   Pentagon Calls for 10% Cut in Troops
   In Pacific, but Fight in Congress Is Seen

   WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department, in a long-awaited
report, is repeating its call for cuts of only about 10% in
U.S. troops in the Pacific over the next three years, setting
the stage for a likely confrontation with Congress.
   Many lawmakers had hoped the study, which Congress ordered
last year, would provide the framework and momentum for
deeper, long-term reductions in U.S. military strength in the
region. Many are pushing for cuts of 20% or more in U.S.
ground and air forces in South Korea alone, along with
comparable reductions in ships and sailors currently assigned
to the Navy's Pacific fleet.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's recommendations don't go beyond proposals
to trim U.S. regional troop strength previously announced as
a first step by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, according to
congressional and Pentagon aides. The report, these aides
said, calls for removing some 14,000 of the 120,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea, Japan and the Philippines over
the next three years.
   The bulk of the proposed reductions would involve support
personnel rather than front-line combat units, persons
familiar with the report said. They added that the report
doesn't identify what additional cuts, if any, the Bush
administration is prepared to embrace in the future.
Classified summaries of the review's findings have been
provided to Capitol Hill in the last few days, and the Senate
Armed Services Committee has scheduled a hearing on the
matter later this month.
   Lawmakers who demanded the study as part of a compromise
that postponed reductions in Pacific forces planned for last
year are dissatisfied with its major findings.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.), a leader in the fight for
sweeping troop reductions in that part of the world, said in
an interview that he expects the report "to be nothing more
than a warmed-over version of what Secretary Cheney has been
saying. It's not going to have any long-term projections."
   Along with several senior members of the Senate Armed
Services and Appropriations committees, Sen. Bumper is
expected again this year to push for a floor vote on proposed
larger troop withdrawals.
   Defense panel chairman Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), who has
strongly resisted imposing such cuts on the Pentagon,
recently complained that Mr. Cheney "has not yet told us what
our force structure would look like" by the mid-1990s under
his defense blueprint.
   The Bush administration, for its part, hopes to use the
report as part of a holding action to postpone action and
retain flexibility for itself about the ultimate size and
shape of substantial cuts that seem inevitable in the
Pacific. Sharper and faster cuts than those advocated by the
report, according to Pentagon aides, could prompt questions
about U.S. staying power and reduce stability in the region.
   Mr. Cheney, who spent nearly two weeks in February
spreading that message to Pacific leaders, told a group of
newspaper publishers last week: "We can save some money by
bringing home some of the forces, but I think we're going to
want to continue to be active in the Pacific and in Europe."
   Other senior Pentagon officials go further in defending
their refusal to cut more deeply in the Pacific. Air Force
Secretary Donald Rice, for instance, said in a recent
interview that Soviet military intentions in the region
remain uncertain and "tend to fall into a different category"
than Moscow's moves to improve East-West dialogue regarding
Europe. The arms-control initiatives and massive troop
cutbacks Moscow has proposed for Europe, Mr. Rice said,
"don't have a lot to do with the Pacific."

   TOMS RIVER, N.J. -- Statewide Bancorp said Douglas E.
Johnson was named president and chief executive officer of
the parent and its largest subsidiary, First National Bank of
Toms River.
   He succeeds Richard D. Sutton, who continues as chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, the board also approved a first-quarter
loan-loss provision of $13 million, partly because of loans
linked to New Jersey's weak real estate market. Statewide
expects to post a loss for the first quarter, although the
specific amount hasn't been determined, and it said it may
consider cutting or omitting its dividend.
   Company officials weren't available for comment.
   The provision brings the company's loan-loss allowance to
about $20 million, or 1.5% of net loans, up from $15 million
and 1.1% of net loans at the end of last year.
   The bank said it will effect cost controls including
reduced directors' fees, a reduced bank car fleet, and
labor-force cuts through attrition.
   In the year-earlier first quarter, the bank earned $6.3
million, or 59 cents a share.

   LOS ANGELES -- Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors
Corp. posted a combined 1989 net loss of $60.4 million, or
$4.97 a share, including a $55.8 million reserve related to
the planned sales of certain properties.
   The reserve, which was about $20 million more than
expected, reflects anticipated losses from the planned sale
of two Las Vegas hotel-casinos, slightly lower-than-expected
sales prices for other hotels, and higher transactions costs,
said a spokesman for Hotel Investors Trust.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1988, the companies reported net income of $1.3
million, or 11 cents a share. Last year's net income included
$156,000 from gains on sales of certain assets, compared with
gains of $2.6 million in 1988. Revenue rose 23% to $115.5
million from $94 million.
   Shares of Hotel Investors Trust, a real-estate investment
trust, and Hotel Investors Corp., a hotel-management concern,
are paired and trade together on the New York Stock Exchange.
Yesterday, the shares fell 50 cents to close at $4.50.
   The companies also said they reached a revised agreement
to sell certain of their hotels and allowed a separate sales
agreement involving three hotels to lapse after the tenant,
Northview Corp., filed for bankruptcy-law protection.
   The amended agreement calls for the sale of 27 hotels to
an affiliate of EIE International Corp. of Japan for $152.2
million. Hotel Investors announced in February that it had a
definitive agreement to sell 31 hotels to Park Plaza Inc.,
the EIE affiliate, for about $185.8 million.
   The transaction was "renegotiated" after Park Plaza
conducted a physical inspection and analysis of all the
properties, the spokesman said. "The benefits {from the
revised transaction} will be close to those expected" from
the earlier agreement, he added.
   Hotel Investors said a former trustee, John D. Morrissey,
has rejoined the board to fill a vacancy created after John
F. Rothman resigned as president and chief executive officer
last month. Graeme W. Henderson, the trust chairman, was
named a director of the corporation, also filling a slot
vacated by Mr. Rothman.

   SEC Chief Criticizes
   Pennsylvania Proposal
   In Anti-Takeover Law

   WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden criticized a Pennsylvania anti-takeover
proposal that would restrict shareholder proxy fights against
management.
   Mr. Breeden, in his first public comment on the state
proposal, said the measure would "virtually eliminate
shareholders' well-established right to replace a board of
directors." Entrenched directors, he said, "could run a
company into the ground" with shareholders powerless to
react.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Pennsylvania proposal, which is awaiting final action
by the legislature, would toughen the state's anti-takeover
law to require holders who acquire voting rights for over 20%
of a company's shares to offer to buy all the company's
shares outstanding.
   Supporters say the change would enhance what would become
the nation's stiffest state regulation against hostile
takeovers. Opponents say that under the measure the sponsor
of a proxy resolution trying to line up votes could be forced
to buy the company.
   Mr. Breeden indicated that the SEC would intervene if the
final legislation approved by the state interfered with
federal proxy regulations. "We will not hesitate to seek to
enforce federal interests," he said.
   Mr. Breeden spoke at a meeting of the Council of
Institutional Investors, a group made up mostly of
public-employee pension funds with assets totaling more than
$300 billion.
   Council members, including the statewide pension funds
from California, Florida, Connecticut and Massachusetts,
approved a statement saying they would review their holdings
in Pennsylvania companies if the proposed measure was
adopted.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. said it ended a previously
reported agreement to sell its industrial mineral assets to
60%-owned Avalon Corp. but continues to negotiate the sale to
Avalon of its 17% interest in Poco Petroleums Ltd.
   The Toronto-based gold-mining company said the agreement
with Avalon was ended after a minority partner in one of
Corona's mineral properties decided to oppose the sale. The
transaction had been conditional on Avalon obtaining 100%
ownership of the assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Corona spokesman said he expects the sale of the Poco
Petroleums stake to be made at "close to market value,"
giving the transaction an indicated value of about 51.6
million Canadian dollars (US$44.1 million).
   Avalon, an energy exploration and production concern based
in New York, already holds as its main asset a 32% stake in
Poco Petroleums.
   As reported, Poco Petroleums is negotiating a merger with
Voyager Energy Inc. on a share-exchange basis. Avalon said
separately that it has obtained an option to purchase about
32% of Voyager Energy's shares on a fully diluted basis from
CanCapital Corp. for about C$67 million.

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Fairfield Communities Inc., as part
of a restructuring, plans to sell several businesses
including its Home Group operations in Florida and southern
Arizona, its joint venture investments in the U.S. Virgin
Islands and the amenity and commercial operations of its
resort group.
   The company said the sale of discontinued operations
resulted in a $22.9 million charge against 1989 earnings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The announcement of the restructuring came as the
developer of retirement and recreational communities
announced it had sustained a fourth-quarter loss of $5.6
million, or 52 cents a share, on revenue of $58.2 million.
For the same period a year earlier, the company reported a
loss on continuing operations of $1.7 million, or 15 cents a
share, on revenue of $52.9 million.
   For 1989, the company posted a loss from continuing
operations of $1.8 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue
of $240.3 million, down from a gain from continuing
operations of $2.2 million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue
of $210.4 million the year earlier. The company said the
fourth-quarter results reflected damage by Hurricane Hugo to
six company-owned resorts in the Carolinas. The results also
included nonrecurring losses of $3.9 million from discounting
contract receivables and the sale of mortgage receivables at
a discount.
   Also during the fourth quarter, the company said it
incurred a charge of $2.7 million for expenses of continuing
operations associated with attempted financings, a reserve
for litigation and an increase in the allowance for
cancellation of contract receivables for two discontinued
projects.

   Thrift Says Declines of 50%
   And Junk Bond Holdings
   Pose Liquidity Concerns

BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)
SAVINGS AND LOANS, THRIFTS, CREDIT UNIONS (SAL)
</IN>
<LP>
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association disclosed that
declines of 50% or more in the value of certain of its junk
bond holdings contributed to its previously reported
insolvency and that it faces possible liquidity problems
because of newly imposed restrictions on its ability to
obtain funds.
   Over the weekend, Columbia, based in Beverly Hills,
Calif., reported that fourth-quarter losses as well as losses
for the first two months of 1990, stemming from the
deteriorating junk bond market, left it insolvent as of Feb.
28 and susceptible to an imminent federal seizure. The
company disclosed further details in a filing yesterday with
the federal Office of Thrift Supervision. The firm also
revealed that its troubles had left its independent auditor,
Deloitte &amp; Touche, unable to render an opinion about its
year-end financial statements.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The weekend announcements drew a harsh reaction on Wall
Street yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange trading,
Columbia closed at 71.9 cents, down 40.6 cents.
   Among other things, Columbia disclosed that 32 of its
largest junk bond holdings were valued at $308 million less
than it paid for them, with a market value of about $1.8
billion compared with a cost of $2.1 billion, a decline of
15%. Some individual securities owned by the company had even
greater percentage reductions. The company disclosed, for
instance, that its holdings of such troubled issues as
Memorex Telex Corp., E-II Holdings Inc. and Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc. -- for which it paid a total of $280.9
million -- were now valued at only $140.7 million, or about
half as much. It disclosed that Hillsborough Holdings Corp.
bonds for which it paid $65.3 million were currently valued
at $13.2 million -- a decline of 80%, the worst drubbing of
any single issue that the thrift disclosed.
   By regulation, the thrift is required to detail its junk
bond holdings only once a year, and the latest filing gives
investors the first detailed look in a year at Columbia's
junk bond portfolio, by far the largest of any thrift in the
country. Its largest holding was RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.,
which, with a market value of $117.2 million, had actually
increased in value by about $2.3 million since Columbia
purchased it.
   Columbia also disclosed that because of its insolvency and
other troubles that it was facing new restrictions on
gathering funds from federal sources as well as through the
Wall Street money brokers through which it has historically
garnered roughly two-thirds of its deposits. The company
added, however, that despite the restrictions, it believes
"it will have sufficient liquid assets or financing sources
to meet its reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs in 1990."
   Columbia officials declined to comment on the filing.
   The filing said the company had roughly $1.5 billion in
cash or cash equivalents as of Dec. 31 to soften any run.
Moreover, its brokered deposits, totaling about $5.0 billion
as of Dec. 31, or about 65% of total deposits, have
maturities ranging from two to 12 years and can't be
withdrawn. The company added in the filing, however, that it
didn't think it would be able to obtain "significant volumes"
of brokered funds in the future because of institutional
concern over its financial condition as well as federal
limits on such activities.
   Columbia also disclosed that retail deposits obtained
through its branches declined to about $2.8 billion as of
Dec. 31, compared with $3.1 billion a year earlier, and that
it had sustained an additional $78 million reduction this
past January and February. It was unclear how individual
depositors were reacting to news of the insolvency.
   Columbia also said its recent sale of $3.3 billion in
mortgage-backed securities, which it had used as collateral
for obtaining funds, would complicate its deposit-gathering
activities. It said it was counting on making up any deposit
shortfalls through other sources, including advances from
Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. But it said federal
rules covering insolvent institutions make it more costly to
obtain such advances, which stood at about $600 million as of
Feb. 28.

   National Assessment Tests
   Find Lack of Knowledge
   Of U.S. History, Civics

   WASHINGTON -- High school seniors approaching voting age
lack basic knowledge about U.S. government and history,
according to a federal survey.
   Tests administered by the federally funded National
Assessment of Educational Progress in 1988 -- a presidential
election year -- showed that only 57% of the nation's 12th
graders knew that presidential candidates are nominated by
national conventions. Only 51% knew that the Constitution
guarantees religious freedom.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The National Assessment administered history and civics
tests to national samples of students in the fourth, eighth
and 12th grades. Its tests on these subjects and others will
be used to measure progress toward the ambitious education
goals set for the year 2000 that President Bush and the
nation's governors announced earlier this year.
   The tests reveal an uneven grasp of history and civics.
For instance, although 84% of the eighth graders knew how
Abraham Lincoln died, only a quarter knew that his goal in
the Civil War was to save the Union. In civics, only 38% of
the eighth graders knew that Congress makes laws, and only
41% knew that the Supreme Court can declare a law
constitutional.
   The history test showed that only 5% of the high-school
seniors scored high enough to demonstrate an ability to
interpret historical information and ideas. "Far too many of
our students know far too little about where we have come
from and about how we as a nation became what we are today,"
said Richard Riley, former governor of South Carolina and a
member of the National Assessment governing board.
   Like earlier assessments of reading, writing, science and
math, the latest surveys concluded that students watch too
much television and do too little homework. The surveys
showed that only 28.9% of the high-school seniors tested
spend two or more hours on homework each night, while 47.2%
watch more than two hours of TV. Less than half the students
read more than 10 pages daily in school and for homework.

   WOODBURY, N.Y. -- Cablevision Systems Corp. said it
entered a 10-year, $1.15 billion credit facility with a group
of banks jointly led by Citibank and Toronto Dominion Bank.
   The new facility represents a $250 million increase from
the parent company's existing facility and is expected to
close within 30 days, Cablevision said. A spokesman said the
cash would be used for working capital. He declined to
elaborate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts suggested the funds could be used to finance
Cablevision's plan to acquire Gateway Cable from Gilbert
Media Associates L.P. Announced last December, the $102.5
million transaction is expected to close next month and would
give Cablevision an additional 40,000 subscribers. The
company's affiliated systems currently have a 1.5
million-subscriber base.
   The funds also might be put toward Cablevision's
involvement in the Sky Cable plan, announced early this year,
analysts said. Cablevision will spend $75 million over four
years in a joint venture with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.,
General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Communications unit, and
General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit.

   Dollar Becomes the Winner by Default

   NEW YORK -- The dollar rallied again yesterday, the winner
by default as the yen, mark and pound were undercut by
domestic developments.
   The yen was hurt as Tokyo markets put in another
tumultuous performance. Increasingly public German quarrels
over monetary union sapped the mark, and a weekend riot in
London over a new community tax weakened the pound.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But despite some sharp moves higher during the day, the
U.S. unit finished the global day with only modest advances
against most of its major counterparts. Some dealers said
caution ahead of a meeting scheduled for Saturday of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations took the wind out
of the dollar's sails.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.7009 marks, up from 1.6940 marks late Friday, and at
158.95 yen, up from 158.35 yen late Friday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6348, down from $1.6455 Friday.
   At midmorning in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was trading at
about 159.03 yen, off from 159.10 yen at the opening and down
from Monday's Tokyo close of 159.95 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S.
currency was trading at about 1.7015 marks, up slightly from
the opening quote of 1.7013 marks, and up from Monday's Tokyo
close of 1.6983 marks.
   On Monday in Tokyo, traders said dollar buying by
institutional investors for the new fiscal year and a
newspaper article saying that Japanese insurance companies
are planning heavy sales of their stock holdings pushed the
U.S. unit sharply higher early in the day, before it gave
back some ground on profit-taking and Bank of Japan dollar
sales.
   Early in Tokyo, the dollar shot to 160.30 yen, its
intraday high. Surprised by the speed of the move,
participants began to take profits, dragging the U.S. unit
lower.
   The Bank of Japan joined in with intervention estimated by
traders to have involved $300 million to $500 million.
   Later, in Europe and the U.S., the dollar surged on a
report that the East German central bank opposed the West
German central bank's plan that monetary union involve an
exchange rate of two East German marks for one West German
mark for all but the first 2,000 East German marks in savings
accounts. For those 2,000 East German marks, the rate would
be one-for-one.
   The East German criticism followed a flurry of conflicting
comments by West German politicians on the monetary union.
West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, who had
endorsed the West German central bank's two-for-one plan over
the weekend, told the Bild newspaper in an interview
scheduled to be published Tuesday that politicians will
decide the exchange rate, not the West German central bank.
The comments to Bild appeared to indicate that Mr. Haussmann
was distancing himself from the West German central bank's
plan.
   Sterling fell as soon as trading opened in Asia. Weekend
riots in the United Kingdom over the poll tax that took
effect Sunday in England and Wales have raised questions
about the durability of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The yen is being hurt by the failure of the Bank of Japan
and the Japanese Ministry of Finance to agree on a monetary
policy, and by the massive outflows of capital from Japan to
take advantage of the relatively cheaper prices of real
estate and assets elsewhere, said Sung Won Sohn, chief
economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
   The turmoil in Japanese markets was underlined again
yesterday by a plunge of 1,978.38 points in the Nikkei stock
index, to 28,002.07 points.
   Talk of another interest rate increase in Japan, less than
two weeks after the Bank of Japan boosted the discount rate
to 5.25% from 4.25%, was cited as the cause of a sell-off of
the dollar in afternoon trading in New York. The discount
rate is the central bank's base rate on loans to commercial
banks.
   Despite pessimism over the yen, dealers are also wary of
pushing it too low ahead of the meeting scheduled Saturday of
the Group of Seven industrial nations. Although most don't
expect the G-7 to agree on a way to defend the Japanese unit,
they don't want to put too much money on that expectation.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $369.80 an ounce, down 40 cents from
Friday. Estimated volume was a light 1.9 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold opened for trading at $370.55
an ounce.

   WASHINGTON -- Several important House lawmakers agreed on
an approach to regulating cancer-causing industrial emissions
that would be more stringent than President Bush's clean-air
proposal.
   Under the approach, backed by Chairman John Dingell of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee; Rep. Henry Waxman (D.,
Calif.), chairman of the panel's health subcommittee; and New
York Rep. Norman Lent, the ranking GOP member of the panel,
factories that emit such pollutants would have to install the
best available technology for reducing emissions. All sources
of cancer-causing pollution would have to be regulated within
10 years, except for those that pose a cancer risk to nearby
residents of less than one in one million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency would study whether
any cancer risk remains after this technology is applied. It
would then establish standards that provide an "ample margin
of safety."
   The plan could be voted on in committee as early as today.
   Under the president's proposal, 50% of all sources of
toxic pollution would be regulated within 10 years.
Additional, deeper cutbacks could be required on a
case-by-case basis if EPA, taking cost and health into
account, finds a plant's fumes still pose "unreasonable"
risks.
   The Senate plan would aim to protect an individual with
slightly above-average exposure and would set a cancer-risk
standard of one in 10,000. This provision is part of the
clean-air bill that the Senate is expected to approve
tonight.

   OKLAHOMA CITY -- Texas International Co. said its plan of
reorganization will become effective next Monday, two years
after it filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Under the plan, the company will change its name to
Phoenix Resource Cos., all old Texas International securities
will be canceled, new securities of Phoenix will be issued
and a new board will be established, the company said.
Phoenix will continue as an independent oil and gas company,
with primarily overseas business, and will retain ownership
of all assets of Texas International.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The reorganization plan, which settles about $150 million
in debt, was confirmed by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court here in
January. Implementation remains subject to approval of the
new trust indentures by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the company said.
   Under the plan, trading of Texas International securities
will be permanently suspended prior to the market opening
Friday, and the registries of the company's securities will
be permanently closed at the close of business the same day.
Holders of Texas International securities will be entitled to
receive new Phoenix securities, which will begin trading
Monday on a when-issued basis on the Pacific Stock Exchange.
   Texas International was delisted from the New York Stock
Exchange in 1986. After several years of struggling under a
heavy debt load, the company sought Chapter 11 protection in
April 1988.

Both Chiquita and Great American, a broadcasting concern, are

   Waste Management Inc. said it will gain majority control
of Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., in a $500 million
transaction that analysts called complementary to both
companies.
   The acquisition of the majority stake will provide Oak
Brook, Ill.-based Waste Management -- the nation's largest
collector of municipal garbage -- with enhanced technology
and waste-processing capabilities. Wheelabrator is a Hampton,
N.H.-based developer and operator of waste-to-energy
facilities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under an accord announced yesterday, Waste Management will
increase its Wheelabrator holdings to 55% from the current
22% through an exchange of stock. The pact allows Waste
Management to name a majority of Wheelabrator directors.
   Terms of the pact call for Wheelabrator shareholders --
other than Waste Management -- to exchange each of their
shares for 0.469 Waste Management share and 0.574
Wheelabrator share. Waste Management would issue about 15.2
million common shares, giving the transaction a value of
about $521.7 million at yesterday's closing price.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Wheelabrator shares jumped $1.50 to close at $35; Waste
Management shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $34.25.

   LOS ANGELES -- An Arizona investor alleged that
Rykoff-Sexton Inc. and two of its top officers issued a
series of misleading positive statements about the
food-service concern's finances.
   Investor Rodney B. Shields, in a complaint filed in U. S.
District Court here, charged that Rykoff concealed
"significant problems" it was having controlling expenses
related to its rapid growth and acquisitions during the
period March 3, 1989 to Feb. 7, 1990. The company also
allegedly faced undisclosed costs relating to a self-insured
health care program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On Feb. 7, Los Angeles-based Rykoff said it expected to
report fiscal third-quarter earnings that were a fraction of
analysts' expectations. Last month, the company reported net
income of $610,000, or five cents a share, representing an
87% plunge from $4.5 million, or 38 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue climbed 8.2%, to $343.4 million from $317.2
million.
   According to the complaint, the price of Rykoff shares
dropped from a high of $29 during the period of alleged
misleading statements to as low as $16.875 after Feb. 7. The
stock closed at $17.25 a share yesterday in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading, off 25 cents.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages. Also named as
defendants are Rykoff's chief executive officer, Roger W.
Coleman, and Victor B. Chavez, chief financial officer.
   A company spokesman said Rykoff "believes it has
meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and will vigorously
defend" itself.

   M.A. Hanna Co., Cleveland, said it expects to establish a
reserve of as much as $11.5 million against first-quarter
earnings. The charge comes as a result of the bankruptcy-law
filing of a customer of a coal company in which Hanna owns a
50% stake.
   A spokeswoman at the natural resources and rubber products
concern said the $11.5 million reflects about half of the
amount the customer owes the coal company, Colowyo Coal Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the 1989 first quarter Hanna earned $13.8 million, or
54 cents a share, on revenue of $256.4 million.
   Hanna said the charge stems from last week's
bankruptcy-law filing by a customer of Colowyo. Colowyo
supplies coal to Colorado-Ute Electrical Association, which
owed Colowyo about $23 million for coal shipped during March,
Hanna said.
   Colorado-Ute filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Hanna said it remains confident about Colowyo's prospects.

   GM To Name Today
   Stempel as Chairman
   And Chief Executive

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. will announce today that
Robert C. Stempel, its 56-year-old president, will be named
chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding Roger B.
Smith, who is to retire Aug. 1.
   Mr. Stempel, it was learned, won't be succeeded as
president of GM. Instead, the auto maker will promote two
executive vice presidents to vice chairmen: John F. Smith Jr.
and Robert J. Schultz. Both will retain their current duties,
Mr. Smith as head of GM's international operations and Mr.
Schultz as head of technical staffs and GM's two big
subsidiaries, Electronic Data Systems Corp. and GM Hughes
Electronics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd E. Reuss, another executive vice president who's
responsible for GM's huge North American auto operations,
will become president of those operations, essentially a
change in title. However, he will also gain additional
responsibility by overseeing GM's huge components operations.
Those operations will continue to report to William E.
Hoglund, who continues as executive vice president but now
will report to Mr. Reuss.
   Two other executive vice presidents, Robert T. O'Connell
and F. Alan Smith, will remain in their current posts, Mr.
O'Connell as head of financial operations and Alan Smith as
head of corporate staff functions. None of the Smiths --
Roger, John or Alan -- is related.
   Mr. Stempel has long been regarded as the favorite to
succeed Roger Smith as chairman of the world's largest
industrial company, but his appointment marks a significant
departure from tradition at GM. Mr. Stempel is an engineer.
GM usually draws its chairmen from its financial ranks.
   The company's theory has been that only financial men can
enforce cost discipline at a company where spending is
measured in the tens of billions of dollars. If GM's
engineers were left to their own devices, the reasoning goes,
they would overspend like unfettered Pentagon generals,
bringing mediocre earnings to a company where the boast has
long been: "General Motors doesn't make cars. It makes
money."
   But that theory has been blown apart during this decade.
GM spent more than $70 billion in capital outlays during the
1980s, but the company's U.S. market share has dropped more
than 10% and for three years in a row earnings fell behind
those of its smaller rival, Ford Motor Co. Many at GM are
convinced that the company needs a "product man" to revive
its fortunes in its largest market.
   Mr. Stempel has that reputation, even though his track
record is somewhat hard to guage. He has had six different
jobs at GM in the past 11 years.
   The jobs that brought Mr. Stempel to the fore were his
leadership of GM's Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group, which
makes most of the company's large cars, between 1984 and
1986, and head of truck and international operations in 1986
and 1987.
   The BOC group adopted a decentralized operating structure
that has made it far more effective than its counterpart, the
Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada group. BOC leads in product quality
and in profitability by a wide margin. GM's international
operations, meanwhile, have turned the corner to handsome
profitability in recent years, especially in Europe.
   Because of his relatively young age, Mr. Stempel, like
Chairman Smith, can be expected to have a long tenure at the
helm of GM. His most significant challenge will be turning
around the company's troubled North American auto operations,
which have suffered from a decade of decline.

   Kohl Reassures
   East Germans
   On Mark Plan

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl rushed
to neutral ground after a Bundesbank proposal to strictly
limit the exchange of East German savings into West German
marks provoked warnings of social unrest in East Germany and
a round of criticism in Bonn.
   "No decisions or commitments whatsoever have been made,"
Mr. Kohl declared in a statement. The chancellor said the
Bundesbank recommendation would be studied carefully, but
stressed that preparatory talks were still under way.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I expressly acknowledge my responsibility for the people
of the DDR {East Germany}. I repeatedly underlined my pledge
to solidarity during the DDR election campaign, and I stand
by this," Mr. Kohl asserted. He reaffirmed plans to achieve a
currency union with East Germany this summer, but offered no
specific conversion rates. Talks on monetary union will
resume with the formation of a new East German government,
Mr. Kohl said.
   The controversial Bundesbank plan would limit the 1-for-1
conversion rate for East Germany's 160 billion East German
marks in savings to 2,000 West German marks ($1,181.40) per
person. The central bank also stipulated that the remainder
of savings -- as well as wages, pensions and debt -- be
converted at a rate of one West German mark for two East
German marks. This would minimize strains on East German
industry and lessen the inflationary impact on West German
monetary policy, officials explained.
   Chancellor Kohl had promised a 1-for-1 rate for savers
while campaigning for East German conservative candidates
last month. East German leaders say their electorate had
widely interpreted the assurance as meaning that all savings,
wages and pensions of the 16 million East Germans would be
converted at the more-favorable rate.
   The discord over the knotty currency issue has complicated
Chancellor Kohl's hitherto mostly smooth progress toward
German unity, capped by the conservative victory in East
Germany's March 18 elections. Finance Minister Theo Waigel
has endorsed the Bundesbank's plan, but other senior Bonn
cabinet members were keeping their distance. Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in a radio interview yesterday
the Bundesbank recommendations "won't be the last word and
can't be the last word."
   The Social Democratic opposition party in Bonn was quick
to exploit the dispute. Oskar Lafontaine, the SPD's candidate
for chancellor in West Germany's December elections, accused
Mr. Kohl of breaking a promise in what he called "voter
deception" after many East German voters chose a three-party
alliance led by the East German Christian Democratic Union on
the basis of Mr. Kohl's conversion promise.
   East Germans officials fear that a dilution of East German
savings and incomes would impoverish normal wage earners.
They predicted demonstrations and a new wave of emigration if
the Bundesbank plan were adopted. East German union leaders
warned of imminent strikes by protesting workers unless a
clear signal was sent from Bonn.
   East Germany's premier-designate, Lothar de Maiziere, said
yesterday his East German Christian Democrats are sticking to
its promise for a broad 1-for-1 exchange.
   "We don't believe it possible that salaries, wages, and
pensions can be treated on a 1-for-2 basis," Mr. de Maiziere
said in East Berlin. He observed that average East German
wages already amount to only one-third of West German levels.
   West German monetary officials worry that the vast gap in
West German and East German productivity levels could unleash
inflation.
   Bonn already is expected to have to come up with as much
as 50 billion marks a year to rebuild East Germany's
crumbling infrastructure. And because Bonn would have to foot
the bill for any East German crisis -- such as mass
unemployment or a collapse of the social security system --
Mr. Kohl is seen walking a fine line between promises to the
East German electorate and the advice of his monetary
experts.

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal National Mortgage Association
introduced a new mortgage-backed security to increase
below-market mortgage funds designated for low-income buyers
by the Federal Home Loan Banks.
   The financial instrument, called Fannie Mae Affordables,
allows members of the 12 regional Home Loan Banks to pool
special below-market loans originated under two programs
mandated by last year's savings-and-loan rescue legislation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The loans are funded with advances from the Home Loan
Banks. Under the Affordable Housing Program, the regional
banks provide subsidized advances to member institutions,
while funds for the Community Investment Program are advanced
at cost. The Affordable Housing Program is expected to total
more than $78 million this year.
   Mortgages originated under the low and moderate income
program can be swapped for Fannie Mae Affordables, which are
single-lender pools as low as $250,000. Institutions can keep
Fannie Mae Affordables as an investment or sell them back to
the regional banks to repay advances. Pools of less than $1
million won't be traded freely on the open market.
   Larry H. Dale, Fannie Mae's senior vice president of
multifamily finance and housing initiatives, said the company
has been working out details of the program with the Home
Loan Banks since the fall. "One of the real beauties of this
approach is that it makes it possible for the Home Loan Banks
and their members to work within an environment they know
well," he said.
   Fannie Mae, a federally chartered, publicly traded
corporation, operates a secondary market for mortgage loans,
buying loans from lenders, packaging them into securities and
selling some to investors while holding others in its
portfolio.

   AT&amp;T Unit Unveils
   A Minicomputer

   NEW YORK -- AT&amp;T Computer Systems unveiled several new
computer and communications products, including a powerful
entrant into the increasingly competitive market for
minicomputers handling transactions.
   The new mini, which had been expected, comes in a series
called the AT&amp;T System 7000 and is being marketed to
companies with heavy transaction processing needs such as
hotels, financial-services companies and phone companies. It
is also the product of a yearlong collaboration between the
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. unit and Pyramid
Technology Corp., Mountain View, Calif., which designed and
builds the machine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 7000 is AT&amp;T's first minicomputer product employing
reduced-instruction-set-computing (RISC) architecture. RISC
designs offer faster computing since the computer needs fewer
internal instructions to perform tasks. The computer also
uses the Unix software operating system designed by AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories and is said to handle 170 transactions per
second and up to 122 million instructions per second.
   James E. Clark, AT&amp;T product management and development
vice president for minicomputers and high performance
systems, said the new line expands the performance of AT&amp;T's
products beyond its current top-of-the-line 3B minicomputers.
This, he added, should make AT&amp;T competitive with low-end
mainframe computers made by International Business Machines
Corp. and Amdahl Corp. and RISC-based systems that AT&amp;T
expects its competitors such as Digital Equipment Corp. to
bring out in 1991.
   Pricing for the new computer ranges from $88,000 for a
system, including software, that handles 128 computer users,
to $225,000 for a system tying together 1,000 users.

   TIMONIUM, Md. -- Kirschner Medical Corp. said it is
seeking to sell or spin off its troublesome Chick division,
which makes surgical lights and tables, allowing the company
to focus on its core orthopedic products.
   The company also announced the renegotiation of $35
million in bank debt. Under the new terms, the loans are
payable on demand and subject to review in 90 days.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, Kirschner said two stockholders filed suit
against the company and three officers and directors,
alleging that it deceived investors as to its financial
condition. Kirschner said it denies "any wrongdoing" and
intends to vigorously contest the suit, which was filed March
23 in U.S. District Court in Maryland.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Kirschner
shares fell $1.25 to close at $7.
   The Chick business, which is more capital-intensive than
Kirschner's other lines, has been a "considerable drain" on
the company's profit, a spokesman said.
   The division also has been a source of patent and
business-agreement disputes with ALM Equipment Hospitaliers
S.A. of France. In January, Kirschner lost a patent
infringement lawsuit to ALM Equipment over Kirschner's Chick
II surgical light. A jury awarded $820,000 in damages to ALM.
Kirschner says it may appeal.
   In a separate issue, last summer an arbitration panel
found that ALM had unfairly breached an agreement to supply
Kirschner with surgical lights and ordered ALM to pay
as-yet-unspecified damages.
   Kirschner said it retained investment banker Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons to assist it in developing strategies for Chick, which
contributed $13 million to Kirschner's total revenue of about
$68 million.
   The company also said it expects to release fiscal 1989
results by the end of this week.

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Outlet Communications Inc., which
recently sold several broadcasting properties, said it is
considering the sale of the company, including its VHF
television stations here and in Columbus, Ohio.
   Outlet said it authorized its financial adviser, First
Boston Corp., to "explore strategic alternatives that will
maximize shareholder value," but that it isn't certain that
"any such transaction will occur."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Outlet Class A
shares closed at $21.25, up $2.
   Outlet currently owns two VHF television stations which
are NBC network affiliates, WJAR-TV in Providence and WCMH-TV
in Columbus, Ohio. It recently sold two UHF television
stations and two radio stations to Chase Communications of
Hartford, Conn., for $120 million. Net proceeds were used to
satisfy the stations' $10 million in obligations and reduce
Outlet's $84 million bank debt, as well as increase its cash
balance, Outlet said.
   Outlet added that it is also exploring the possibility of
buying up to $20 million of its notes, common stock or a
combination of both. Outlet said it is considering the
purchase because its bonds are trading "below face value."
   Outlet, which reported 1989 net income of $15.9 million,
or $2.43 a share, said it authorized First Boston to contact
parties concerning the possible sale or merger of the
company.
   The company's 1989 earnings include a $4.6 million
extraordinary credit. The company reported a loss of $21.8
million, or $3.32 a share, in 1988.
   In February, a group that includes Gabelli &amp; Co., a New
York-based investment concern, reported to the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it holds a 7.7% in Outlet.

   UAL, Unions
   Seem to Be Near
   Buy-Out Pact

   A group of United Airlines unions appeared to be moving
toward a possible agreement with UAL Corp. on terms of an
employee buy-out of the nation's second-largest airline.
   Some people close to the situation said there was an even
chance of an agreement in the next few days. It appeared that
both the unions and the UAL board had a general understanding
of how an accord could be structured.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the same people cautioned that any number of
unresolved issues could slow the progress. In that case, both
sides were prepared to begin the hostilities of a pending
proxy fight by Coniston Partners, UAL's largest shareholder,
which is backing the union buy-out effort.
   The group of United pilots, mechanics, and flight
attendants two weeks ago offered a package of cash, debt and
stock valued at roughly $4 billion, or $185 a share, for a
75% stake in the airline. Current UAL shareholders would keep
25% of the company.
   The unions were said to be unwilling to sweeten that
offer, even informally, without advance assurance that a new,
higher bid would be accepted. The board has been asking $220
a share, but had given some indication it might accept as
little as $200.
   UAL directors conferred by phone yesterday in a meeting
that began around 4:30 p.m. EDT. Some people said they might
reconvene in person within the next few days if they were
ready to approve the union offer.
   The maneuvering between the unions and the board, which
took place largely through phone contacts among their
advisers, was enlivened by reports of a new proposal from
Marvin Davis. The Los Angeles investor in August made a $5.4
billion bid for UAL, which set the stage for a $6.79 billion
labor-management buy-out effort that collapsed in October.
   Crain's Chicago Business reported that Mr. Davis, who last
month was released from an earlier promise not to buy UAL
stock, had submitted a "concept" for a bid higher than $220 a
share. If Mr. Davis failed to obtain financing, the Crain's
report said, UAL could sell assets and deliver the proceeds
to shareholders.
   One source confirmed that UAL has received such a
proposal. But another noted the idea isn't in writing, and
isn't being actively pursued. Aides to Mr. Davis wouldn't
comment.
   However, some takeover stock traders were skeptical,
noting the Davis proposal's similarity to the board's own
position that it might be able to deliver greater value than
the union proposal by selling assets. They speculated that
the board might be trying to use the Davis idea as a threat
to get the unions to sweeten their bid.
   UAL shares traded in a narrow range most of the day,
finishing down 87.5 cents to $161.125 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Communications between the unions and the board were
complicated by the threat that, if they couldn't agree, they
would soon be exchanging fusillades in a proxy contest. The
unions couldn't raise their bid informally, if they were then
to turn around and campaign for shareholder votes for a bid
of about $185 a share.
   Financing remained another major uncertainty. Although the
proposed price is much lower than the $300-a-share buy-out
that collapsed last fall, some bankers may be leery of
lending to an unwieldy union troika that so far lacks the
backing of an equity investor.
   Some traders believe the board may accept the union
proposal, subject to the group obtaining financing, as a way
of surviving the proxy challenge by Coniston. If the union
can't obtain financing, such a scenario could leave incumbent
UAL directors in office, leaving uncertain the fate of UAL
Chairman Stephen Wolf, whom the union group has vowed to
replace.

   Amdura, Failing
   To Get More Credit,
   Files for Chapter 11

   DENVER -- After failing to obtain additional credit from
its lenders, Amdura Corp. filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The action caps a long line of trouble that began when the
automotive and hardware distributor and specialty
manufacturer bought CoastAmerica Corp. in 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CoastAmerica was acquired with a $260 million credit
facility from a group of 14 banks led by Chicago-based
Continental Bank. Last year, discontent over the handling of
the resulting debt led to a battle between then-incumbent
Amdura management and New York investor Frank J.A. Cilluffo,
who succeeded in ousting Amdura's chief executive officer and
board members in a consent solicitation.
   Last October, after a new management team took over, the
bank group gave Amdura a new $30 million credit line and
extended a $40 million bridge loan made in connection with
the CoastAmerica acquisition. But the new money wasn't enough
to stem Amdura's troubles.
   The company hasn't released financial results for 1989 but
last month Amdura said that a restructuring charge to be
recorded against fourth-quarter earnings would result in a
"substantial" loss for the year.
   Last month the company also said it was seeking additional
working capital from its lenders. Those negotiations failed.
   The company said that its hardware distribution
subsidiaries, including CoastAmerica and Amdura National
Distribution Co. would also file for Chapter 11 protection
but that its manufacturing subsidiaries, Crosby Group Inc.
and Harris Waste Management Group Inc. would be excluded from
the filing.
   The company has been trying to sell the Crosby and Harris
units. Neither sale has been completed, although a sale of
the Crosby unit is pending.
