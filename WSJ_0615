   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission rebutted
charges that it is using anti-dumping duties to erect trade
barriers against imports, especially from Asian nations.
   Presenting an annual report on anti-dumping
investigations, a spokesman for the commission said the
document proves that allegations the EC is using dumping
duties to "build a fortress Europe" are unfounded. Dumping is
the selling of a product in a foreign market at a price lower
than the home-market price or the cost of production. He said
EC dumping policies were "applied impartially to protect EC
industry against the practice of dumping, which is illegal
under GATT {the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a
Geneva-based trade regulator}."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The spokesman said the EC dealt with dumping cases from
state trading nations in Eastern Europe as frequently as from
Asia. In 1988, the year covered by the report, the EC opened
11 cases against Eastern European countries and the same
number of cases against Japan and South Korea together.
   But EC dumping actions against Japan and South Korea in
recent years have sparked disputes, because they tended to
involve the lucrative consumer electronics industry, in which
European companies are struggling to stay competitive.
Dumping cases against Eastern Europe focus on metals,
chemicals and plastics.
   Also, the commission has been accused by Japanese
companies, as well as some trade specialists, of using unfair
methods of calculation that lead to high dumping duties on
Japanese products. As a result, the EC is under pressure
within GATT to make its anti-dumping rules more transparent.
   The report showed that 79 dumping investigations were
opened or under way during 1988, resulting in the imposition
of 18 definitive and 28 provisional duties.

   RICHMOND, Va. -- James River Corp. said it will contruct a
$65 million plant to recycle waste paper at its existing
tissue mill in Halsey, Ore.
   The company, a paper goods manufacturer, said the plant
will clean and process industrial and office-waste papers
from the western United States. The facility is expected to
produce up to 300 tons a day of high-grade fiber for several
of the company's Northwest mills.

   Environment:
   States Mull Rash of Diaper Regulations

   Forget about complicated tax initiatives. These days, the
hottest issue in state legislatures is easier for many
consumers to understand: disposable diapers.
   With space in municipal landfills growing scarce and no
relief in sight from the flood of trash from homes and
businesses, states are pinning their hopes on regulating
disposable diapers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Already, some 20 states have pondered proposals that range
from disposable-diaper taxes to all-out bans of disposables.
   Nebraska has approved a ban on non-degradable disposable
diapers, which is slated to take effect in 1993. Legislators
in Maine have passed a law requiring day-care centers to
accept children in cloth diapers; California may follow suit.
And New York is considering requiring all hospitals to
provide new mothers with brochures that warn of the
environmental threat posed by disposables.
   Although only a handful of the legislative proposals have
been enacted, manufacturers are taking the threat very
seriously. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies, mobilized
100,000 Wisconsin parents this year to help defeat a state
bill that would have taxed disposables. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.,
the largest maker of disposables, recently funded a
controversial study by Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm,
that concluded disposable diapers are less damaging to the
environment than cloth ones -- a contention strongly disputed
by environmentalists.
   Disposable diapers make an appealing environmental target.
Unlike saving the Brazilian rain forests or halting acid
rain, diaper pollution is an issue that allows individuals to
play an active role in helping the environment. And, on one
level, diaper statistics sound alarming: The average tyke
goes through 7,800 diapers in the first 130 weeks of life.
Some 18 billion disposable diapers end up in landfills each
year.
   "Diapers are a neat symbol of the crimes of our disposable
society," says Jerry Taylor, legislative director at the
American Legislative Exchange Council, a Washington-based
association of state legislatures.
   But experts on both sides of the debate agree that
disposable diapers account for less than 2% of the nation's
garbage. Newspapers and magazines, for example, together
account for as much as five times that amount. Carl
Lehrburger, an Albany, N.Y., consultant who wrote a 1988
study that helped raise public concern about the problems
with disposable diapers, says diapers are far from the
biggest waste problem. While he supports reusable
alternatives to the throwaways, he says, "the issue has
gotten more attention than it deserves."
   While disposable diapers may not be an environmental
disaster, they present their makers with a public-relations
nightmare.
   P&amp;G, whose Pampers and Luvs brands account for 50% of the
$3.5 billion U.S. disposable-diaper market, is aggressively
trying to improve its image with consumers and state
legislators. To assuage consumers, the company has sent out a
brochure touting the health benefits of disposable diapers --
they help keep babies dry and cut down on diaper rash -- as
well as pointing out that making and washing cloth diapers
also harm the environment. The company ran a full-page ad in
the Boston Globe pointing out that biodegradable diapers
don't actually break down in landfills. A company spokesman
says P&amp;G doesn't plan to run further ads.
   Most recently, P&amp;G distributed to state legislators and
environmentalists the Arthur D. Little study that it
commissioned. The study compares the environmental impact of
cloth and disposable diapers over the lifetime of the
products-from manufacture through disposal. Among the
findings: Cloth diapers consume more energy and water than
their disposable counterparts. They also result in greater
air and water pollution emissions and cost more than
disposable diapers, even before cloth diaper-service costs
are included.
   Mr. Lehrburger, however, maintains the Arthur D. Little
study is flawed because, among other things, it overestimates
the cost of laundering cloth diapers.
   Kimberly-Clark is also working to get its message out and
stave off further regulatory efforts. The company has already
sent mailers defending disposables to all of its shareholders
along with its fourth-quarter results. Now, the Dallas-based
paper maker is planning to blitz parents across the U.S. with
a pro-disposables mailing.
   Even some environmental activists say the diaper
industry's lobbying and public relations campaigns are having
an effect. In addition to Wisconsin, lobbying activities by
manufacturers helped defeat a California measure that would
have required an environmental warning label on all
disposable-diaper packages. A similar proposal was derailed
in New York.
   "They've muddied the water enough to make it questionable
about what the solution should be," says Jeffrey Tryens, an
associate director of the Center for Policy Alternatives,
which helps states develop environmental and economic
policies.
   Nonetheless, even diaper marketers concede the issue is
unlikely to disappear. Although diapers account for a
fraction of all waste, states are likely to welcome any
solution as the nation's garbage crisis worsens. And unlike
curbside recycling projects, banning or restricting diapers
doesn't require cities to build expensive facilities.
   Many of the proposals introduced during the past year are
unlikely to surface again. Several states considered bans on
all but so-called degradable diapers, a concept that has been
discredited, since nothing breaks down in airtight,
moisture-proof landfills. But given the number and variety of
legislative initiatives introduced, some of the legislation
is likely to eventually pass into law. "The heat will
definitely continue for disposables," says Roger Bognar,
manager of the tissue paper division of the American Paper
Institute.
   But so far, the environmental angst hasn't translated into
declining sales for disposable diapers. Despite environmental
concerns and little population growth, sales of disposable
diapers increased about 1.3% last year, according to Bonita
Austin, a consumer products analyst at Wertheim Schroeder &amp;
Co.
   Few consumers, it seems, are willing to sacrifice the
convenience of disposable diapers to save the planet.
   Although Terry Edwards, who lives in suburban Chicago,
sorts her garbage into five separate bins to facilitate
recycling, she says she wouldn't consider using cloth diapers
on her four-month-old son. "I don't want smelly diapers
around my house," she says. "The diaper manufacturers should
come up with a better product or a better way to handle
them."

   But There's Still No Way to Beat
   An Open Mouth and Bent Elbow

   These bartenders pour only one kind of booze, and they
don't talk back.
   Liquor company Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons challenged
students at six leading U.S. design schools to come up with
"Rube Goldberg-like contraptions" for pouring its expensive
Crown Royal Canadian whiskey. The Seagram Co. unit got the
idea from one of its ads in which a slingshot-golf
ball-mouse-clown-balloon arrangement appeared to cause a
bottle of Crown Royal to tip into a glass.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The device didn't actually work, but the marketers last
year decided to launch a search for one that did. The rules
required each gizmo to have a running time of one to five
minutes, and to be at least two feet by two feet by three
feet in size. The grand-prize winner, announced yesterday, is
a joint entry by Dan Schwab and Dave Banko from North
Carolina State University; they get a $5,000 prize and their
contraption will tour the country with other winning entries
in September. Seagram also gave $5,000 to each school to help
pay for work on the contraptions.
   Gizmos ranged from a rather linear
balls-moved-by-ramps-and-pistons machine (Minneapolis College
of Art and Design) to the grand-prize-winning multihued
jungle gym of pipes that uses a pendulum, ramps and rolling
and bouncing colored balls to tip the bottle.
   Push a daisy on Miguel Calvo's campy, gilt-framed
thingamajig, and as "Tea for Two" plays in the background,
clouds part, Crown Royal rains into a glass and a kewpie doll
releases a golden stream over some dead flowers. Mr. Calvo, a
student at New York's Parsons School of Design, says:
"Instead of designing fax machines, here I can do gold frames
and kewpie dolls. It's fun."
   Kim Kwan, of the California College of Arts and Crafts
would only show his invention on a videotape, which he
acknowledges is really a spliced reconstruction. But, he
says: "It works conceptually. It doesn't work 100% of the
time. It was too complex to run at this demo."
   Rube Goldberg would have approved of the contest, says one
of the judges who ought to know. "The idea is to spark
creativity," says George W. George, a theatrical and film
producer and Rube Goldberg's son. "My father's long-standing
appeal was to show how the simplest task, such as opening a
garage door, can be complicated by machines and that human
ideas are what really make things work, not the machine
itself."

   PORTLAND, Ore. -- Fred Meyer Inc. said it reached a new
financing agreement with 10 major banks that more than
doubles the retailing chain's credit line to $335 million.
   The company said Continental Illinois Corp.'s main unit
heads the bank group.

   Fred Meyer said it expanded its credit line to help
finance expected growth and to help pay for upgrading its
computer systems.
   The company was hurt in 1989 by writeoffs on computer
hardware, higher sales promotion costs and other unusual
costs. It had a loss for the year of $6.8 million on sales of
$2.28 billion.

   A federal judge in Santa Fe, N.M., ruled that the
Resolution Trust Corp. can override state banking laws to
facilitate the sale of failed thrifts to banks.
   New Mexico and 12 other states impose varying restrictions
on banks' ability to operate branches, presenting statutory
roadblocks to the RTC's efforts to sell failed thrifts and
their branches.

<TEXT>
   The RTC contends that it has the power, under the
legislation that created the agency last year, to ignore some
state laws in its quest to sell failed savings and loan
associations in the quickest and most cost-effective way
possible. To strengthen its argument, the RTC on June 1
adopted a policy explicitly stating that it can override
state laws.
   Shortly after the policy took effect, trade associations
representing independent and community banks in New Mexico
filed suit, asking federal Judge Santiago Campos to rule that
the policy violates states' rights to establish and enforce
their own laws.
   The trade associations argued that banks buying failed
thrifts and their branches would have an unfair advantage
over banks that don't acquire thrifts and thus must follow
state law restricting branches to their home counties.
   After a hearing in Santa Fe, Judge Campos rejected the
bank organizations' arguments and dismissed their suit. A
final order stating his reasons for the ruling is expected to
be issued today.
   The possible impact of Judge Campos's ruling on other
state laws couldn't immediately be determined. But a federal
judge in Colorado, where bank-branch limitations are among
the strictest in the country, has also been asked to rule on
the legality of the RTC's override policy.
   Barbara Walker, first assistant attorney general in
Colorado, said she filed a request Monday for judicial review
of the policy on behalf of the state banking commissioner. No
court date has been set.

   The Rich Get Enriched
   Lolling in East Europe

   NOT ONES TO MISS the latest trendy trip, the ultra rich
are jetting off to Eastern Europe. But not without their
creature comforts.
   Travel agents report that the very wealthy -- apparently
tired of the plush surroundings of Palm Springs and Monte
Carlo -- are starting to invade the likes of Warsaw,
Leningrad and Prague. "It's definitely becoming a hot spot
for them," says Bill Fischer, president of Fischer Travel
Enterprises, a New York travel agency that deals exclusively
with the well-off.
   By his client's standards (and these are people who drop
thousands of dollars a night for hotel rooms), the
accommodations in the East aren't quite up to snuff. Eastern
Europe has only a handful of super-fancy hotels and most of
them don't come close to the four-star hotels of the West. In
East Berlin, the Grand Hotel's best suite does cost more than
$2,000 a night, but that's an exception to the rule. Most
hotel suites in the East charge more in the range of $200 to
$300 a night.
   "That's barely the tip these people might leave for a long
trip," Mr. Fischer chuckles.
   But with a little effort, the super-affluent can travel
East in the style to which they're more accustomed. Many are
arriving in private jets, stocked with their favorite caviar,
travel agents say. To get around town, they're being driven
in Mercedes and BMWs that have been specially shipped in for
the occasion. Chauffeurs have been flown in, too, since
reliable, English-speaking drivers are a rarity in the East.
   Some travel agents also say the rich like to have
one-on-one meetings arranged with residents in the East.
"They want to be able to come back and say, `Oh, I talked
with a real local,'" says Francis Goranin, president of Vega
International Travel Service in Chicago.

   Agent Takes His Cut,
   Cutting Into Refunds
                                                                                                       

   TRAVEL AGENTS are supposed to be a traveler's best friend.
But they may make a lot of enemies if they start following
the lead of one New York agency.
   The agency, Barclay Travel Ltd., recently started
subtracting commissions on nonrefundable tickets that have
been refunded. Airlines sometimes make exceptions when a
traveler can't use a nonrefundable ticket and return the
money. But Barclay has been keeping 10% to 15% of its
clients' refunds in such cases.
   The agency owner, Harry Barclay, argues that travel agents
deserve to be paid for the time they put in reserving and
booking tickets, regardless of whether the client actually
travels. He's also quick to point out that agents spend even
more time helping clients obtain refunds on nonrefundables.
"We were just losing too much on these tickets," he says.
   Mr. Barclay insists that so far few clients have
complained, but acknowledges that one customer is suing him
in small-claims court, after the agency kept almost $100 in
commission on a refunded ticket.
   Several travel agents say they are watching the case
closely, believing the practice could catch on if it's
allowed by the courts. "I think it could be a new trend in
the industry," says Richard Berns, a chapter president for
the American Society of Travel Agents.
   If it does, some travel experts expect a lot of fliers to
grumble. "It's disgraceful," says Theodore Harris, chairman
of Airline Industry Resources, an airline consulting firm in
McLean, Va. "You're not taking the trip, so the service
really hasn't been performed."
                                                                                                       

   The Hotel Phone Bite
   Still Stings Overseas
                                                                                                       

   PUBLIC PRESSURE has led many U.S. hotels to stop jacking
up phone charges. But the reform movement hasn't spread
outside this country.
   In foreign countries, even established chains still
routinely impose huge surcharges on local or long-distance
calls. The London Hilton Hotel on Park Lane, for example,
charges $4 just to make a credit card call. Other hotels tack
on 20% to 30% surcharges on long-distance calls dialed
directly.
   "It's price gouging, plain and simple," says Laurie
Berger, editor of Corporate Travel magazine, who recently got
socked with a $1,200 phone bill for a week's worth of calls
at a London hotel.
   Some hotels argue that the rates have to be so high
because foreign phone systems are expensive to operate. But
other hotels concede they're trying to boost profits and
aren't the least bit apologetic. "If the management decides
that's how they want to make their money, I guess they can
charge what they want," says a spokeswoman for Hilton
International Inc., discussing the London Hilton.
   To get around the charges, many travelers use special
credit cards, such as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's
USADirect card, that allow them to bypass hotel operators on
many long-distance calls.
   Some companies are asking employees to use pay phones when
they can. "So far, we've had a good response," says Edward
Chu, travel director at Warner-Lambert. "They think the
charges are just too ridiculous for even the company to pay."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   YOU DON'T HAVE to stay at Marriott Corp.'s Court yard
hotels anymore to know what a room looks like. In a new twist
to grab guests, Marriott's Courtyard has built a trailer with
a replica of one of its rooms inside, and is using it to tour
more than 20 cities over the next six months. . . . One out
of four drivers had a vehicle breakdown on the road last
year, says a Shell Motorist Club survey. But more breakdowns
took place in town, within three miles of the driver's home,
than out of town.

   Tseng Labs Says
   Profit Forecasts
   Are Near Target

   NEWTOWN, Pa. -- Tseng Labs Inc. is "comfortable" with
analysts' estimates of 1990 earnings of around 40 cents a
share, Jack Gibbons, chief financial officer, said.
   That range would indicate net income of about $7.3
million. In 1989, the maker of enhanced graphics devices for
personal computers had net of $5.1 million, or 28 cents a
share, on sales of $31.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Personal computer sales "are harder to predict than the
weather," Gibbons said in an interview. But he expressed
confidence in Tseng Labs' ability to sustain recent growth
trends.
   The company attributes much of the anticipated improvement
in performance to its ET4000 product line, a new generation
of video graphics array controllers for color monitors. Jack
Tseng, president and chief executive officer, said the ET4000
has "achieved a 20% share after only four to six months on
the market."
   An earlier product, the ET3000, was an important engine of
growth for Tseng Labs in the late 1980s. The product was
developed in response to International Business Machines
Corp.'s introduction in 1987 of its PS/2 line of personal
computers.
   Tseng said the company now delivers about 300,000 to
400,000 video graphic array chips a quarter. Currently, sales
volume for the ET3000 is about twice that of the ET4000. By
the fourth quarter, however, Mr. Tseng said he believes that
ratio will be reversed.
   The ET3000 chip sells at an average price of $23, while
the ET4000 sells on average for $27.
   Mr. Tseng said a computer-product trend toward denser
memory capacity is making data more difficult to retrieve.
This, he said, makes the ET4000 a more attractive product
because of its powerful memory architecture.
   In addition, the company recently introduced the ET1700, a
lower-cost video chip aimed at the large market for
monochrome graphics. By adding the 1700 to its lineup, Tseng
Labs hopes to compete more effectively across both the color
and monochrome segments of the entry-level market.
   At present, Tseng Labs says it has no debt and about $7
million in the bank. Any near-term expansion will be financed
with internally generated funds, Mr. Gibbons indicated. The
company doesn't anticipate any public offerings of securities
in the near future, he said.
   Rather than develop a much wider variety of product lines,
Mr. Tseng said, the company "will continue to grow by
focusing on graphic and imaging applications." For the
forseeable future, he said, he anticipates that the ET3000,
ET4000 and their byproducts will provide the company with the
bulk of its business.
   However, Tseng Labs does plan an entry soon into the
related market of laptop circuit-board products, a move that
probably will require an expanded sales and research effort.
Tseng said the company's lap-top chip currently in
development, called the ET4000LX, is expected to be available
late this year.

   LOS ANGELES -- Spelling Entertainment Inc. said fiscal
third-quarter net income fell nearly 64%, to $954,000, or
three cents a share, from $2.6 million, or nine cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue declined 40% to $37.4 million from $62.1 million.
Operating profit, according to the entertainment production
and distribution company, slipped slightly to $5.3 million
from $5.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jules Haimovitz, Spelling's president and chief operating
officer, attributed the lower net to increased interest and
purchase-price amortization resulting from the company's
acquisition of Worldvision in March 1989.
   Aaron Spelling, chairman and chief executive officer,
noted that the highly successful debut of the ABC-TV show
"Twin Peaks" in April prompted the network to renew the
program for the fall season. In addition, 13 episodes of a
new half-hour series, "American Chronicles," produced by
David Lynch and Mark Frost, was ordered by Fox Broadcasting
Co. for airing in the fall. Spelling's Worldvision subsidiary
has acquired the world-wide distribution rights for both of
these properties.
   In the first nine months, ended April 30, net was $5.4
million, or 13 cents a share, vs. $9 million, or 41 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 19% to $119.2
million from $99.9 million.

   PARIS -- In an apparent challenge to the French
government, Cie. Generale d'Electricite acquired majority
control of the nuclear power plant builder Framatome S.A.
   Just last week, President Francois Mitterrand authorized
aides to pursue a plan for government entities to acquire
majority control of the strategic company, in effect
nationalizing it, to keep it out of CGE's hands.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CGE Chairman Pierre Suard stressed that he still is
willing to negotiate with the government and that "this
doesn't presage the future." Aides to Mr. Mitterrand
downplayed the purchase, saying they had expected CGE to
acquire temporary control and that negotiations will
continue.
   But Mr. Suard said he hasn't agreed to give up control of
Framatome. He said he doesn't know of any other industrial
group capable of overseeing the nuclear power plant builder,
and that if possible he now intends to run Framatome as a CGE
subsidiary.
   "I am very happy with the current situation," he said. "I
won't seek to change that situation unless I receive a
proposal."
   People close to Framatome said they think Mr. Suard
acquired the shares to improve his bargaining position and
get a higher price when it comes time to sell -- an
allegation Mr. Suard rejects.
   "This may make things more difficult, but it won't change
the final outcome," said a person close to Framatome, whose
management supports the president's plan as a means of
remaining independent.
   Socialist members of parliament reacted angrily to Mr.
Suard's acquisition. Several said yesterday that, if a
negotiated settlement isn't reached, they will propose a law
requiring that the majority of Framatome shares be government
controlled.
   The squabble heated up in March, when CGE reached its
initial agreement to acquire a 12% Framatome stake from
construction company Dumez S.A. CGE already had 40%, and the
Dumez stake pushes it to 52%, permitting it for the first
time to run the company. Mr. Suard announced yesterday that
he had completed that much-delayed transaction, which was
initially to have been completed in April. He claimed he
didn't intend to change Framatome's management or undo its
basic policies.
   The government electric company and the Atomic Energy
Commission together hold 45% of Framatome, and the remaining
3% belongs to employees. Until now, that had left Framatome
independently managed, suspended half way between the
government and the private sector.
   CGE makes telephone equipment, trains and heavy electrical
equipment, and in that last capacity supplies extensive
equipment for Framatome projects. But Framatome's
independent-minded chairman, Jean-Claude Leny, and Mr. Suard
never have gotten along. Mr. Suard, for example, criticizes
the joint venture Mr. Leny negotiated with West Germany's
Siemens AG, which Mr. Suard says disadvantages CGE. Mr. Suard
long has said that, to have sufficient clout in its
international dealings, Framatome needs to be part of a large
industrial group -- CGE.
   For France's Socialist president, Framatome is a national
asset that mustn't become the subsidiary of a non-government
group like CGE. France is 70% dependent on nuclear power --
the highest dependence level in the world -- and the
government wants a strong say in the company that builds the
power plants. With Mr. Suard considered close to the
opposition Gaullist party, the president doesn't consider him
a good choice to run the company.
   Prime Minister Michel Rocard has been trying to negotiate
a compromise under which Mr. Suard would sell down to a more
palatable 50% stake in Framatome, and be allowed to run the
company. But the president instructed aides last week to seek
a solution under which the government would take 51% and
Framatome would remain independent. Government-owned bank
Credit Lyonnais currently is trying to put together a
government-led investment group to buy into CGE. Mr. Suard
wouldn't say under what terms he might sell, nor would he say
whether he would be willing to remain as a minority holder in
a government-controlled Framatome.
   CGE said it acquired the Dumez stake under the terms
initially agreed. In exchange for the 12% of Framatome, it is
giving Dumez a 66% stake in its subsidiary CGE-Distribution,
France's third-largest electrical equipment distributor. CGE
is to keep a 34% stake, giving it the right to block any
undesired moves by Dumez. CGE also is making a financial
payment to Dumez, but it declined to disclose the amount.

   PARIS -- French consumer prices in May rose 0.2% from
April and 3% from a year earlier, the National Statistics
Institute said in a preliminary report.
   The May result represents a slowdown in price growth from
April's monthly rise of 0.4% and trims year-to-year inflation
from the April rate of 3.2%. Both of the May figures are in
line with previous estimates by economists, who had based
their outlook on signs that service-sector inflation would
slow from the unusually high rate of 0.8% in April.

   STOCKHOLM -- AB Volvo Chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar was
elected chairman of Swedish holding company Procordia AB
reflecting the successful completion of the companies' plan
to combine the food and pharmaceutical operations.
   Mr. Gyllenhammar was one of five new directors elected by
Procordia shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting. The
other new board members included Christer Zetterberg, Volvo's
chief operating officer; Ulf G. Linden, a Volvo director and
close adviser to Mr. Gyllenhammar; Bengt Samuelsson, a winner
of the Nobel Prize for Medicine and former chairman of
Volvo's drug affiliate Pharmacia AB; plus Stig Malm,
president of Sweden's national blue collar trade union LO.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In December, Volvo and state-controlled Procordia unveiled
a 23.8 billion package of transactions, the biggest corporate
takeover to date in Sweden. The pact called for Procordia to
acquire Volvo's food unit Provendor AB and launch a 15.3
billion public offer for Pharmacia, in which Volvo held a 49%
voting stake.
   After some initial snags, the tender offer for Pharmacia
was completed last month. Procordia obtained acceptances
representing 94% of Pharmacia's share capital and has
commenced arbitration proceedings to acquire the remaining
shares outstanding.
   By accepting newly issued Procordia shares as payment for
Provendor and its Pharmacia stake, Volvo gained a 42% voting
stake in the holding company -- equal to the government's
holding which was nearly halved from 80.5% under the
transaction. That dominant ownership position was underlined
by the reshuffling of Procordia's board.
   Absorbing Provendor and Procordia will boost Procordia's
annual sales by about 70% to an estimated 37 billion kronor
($6.07 billion). The enlarged food and drug divisions will
each rank among Europe's 20 largest companies in their
respective industries.
   In a financial report for this year's first four months
issued Thursday, Procordia said it won't be able to issue a
1990 profit forecast until October. But the 27% surge in
pretax profit for the "old" Procordia during the period
showed the ongoing effects of major restructuring during the
past two years.
   Procordia said profit before tax between January and April
jumped to 753 million kronor from 595 million kronor a year
earlier. Sales in the four months increased 8.7% to 6.8
billion kronor from 6.3 billion a year earlier, the company
said.
   The continued turnaround at drug unit KabiVitrum AB
accounted for most of the profit increase, Procordia said.
KabiVitrum's operating profit in the four months soared 62%
to 412 million kronor from 255 million kronor the previous
year. The drug unit's sales in the period climbed 27% to 1.75
billion kronor from 1.37 billion kronor the previous year.

(US$420.1 million), or C$54.50 an Interhome share.
   The purchase is the first step of a complex reshuffling of
assets announced in April by Toronto's Reichmann family,
which owns 74.3% of Gulf Canada through the family's real
estate flagship, Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.

   Gulf Canada, a Calgary-based oil and gas producer, plans
to resell the 22.8% Interhome stake to Toronto-based GW
Utilities Ltd., thereby raising GW's interest in Interhome to
63.5% from 40.7%. Olympia &amp; York owns 89.3% of GW Utilities,
and plans to take it private under a previous tender offer
for its remaining shares.
   The Reichmanns' plans also call for Gulf Canada to merge
with Calgary-based Interhome's Home Oil Co. unit, and for
Interhome's remaining oil pipeline subsidiary,
Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd., to be spun off later this
year to Interhome's shareholders. The proposals are subject
to holder and other approvals.
   Toronto-based Imperial Oil, a large integrated oil concern
that is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., New York, said previously
it expects the sale of its Interhome stake to generate a net
gain of about C$195 million, or C$1.03 a share.

   PARIS -- The state-owned French steel producer Usinor
Sacilor S.A. said it is launching a bid for 20% of the shares
outstanding of the steel trading company ASD PLC, a 77%-owned
unit of Stemcor PLC, in cooperation with the British concern.
   The French company plans a joint venture with ASD that
will set up a steel-plate trading center outside London.
Usinor will own 49% of the venture, and ASD 51%. The project
is subject to approval by European Community authorities in
Brussels.

   Usinor said the joint concern will boost ASD's steel
trading revenue, which was #205 million ($350.9 million) in
1989. ASD markets about 500,000 metric tons of steel a year
from 20 offices throughout Britain, making it the
second-largest British steel trading concern. A metric ton is
equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   Norwalk, Calif. -- David Johnson had just completed the
first day of the two-day decathlon at the USA/Mobil Track &amp;
Field Championships on a California-perfect Tuesday evening
31 points ahead of his national-record pace, but his
happiness was not complete.
   Surveying the remnants of a crowd of, maybe, 200 people
that had watched the day's five events at Cerritos College
stadium, he observed that more public attention to his
endeavor would be nice.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Better promotion wouldn't have hurt," said the
broad-shouldered Montanan, the defending champ. "The
publicity gave the meet's dates as June 14-16. Today is June
12. Does that mean we're not here?"
   U.S. decathletes, those one-man bands of track and field,
have been complaining thusly for some years, partly because
foreigners have dominated the form since Bruce Jenner rode
his 1976 Olympic victory to screen, sportswear and
Wheaties-box stardom, and we Yanks tend to ignore things
athletic that we don't win.
   But off the results of the competition that ended in cool,
breezy weather here on Wednesday night before a gathering
even smaller than Tuesday's, this could change. Two fellas,
27-year-old Johnson and Dan O'Brien, a springy, 23-year-old
U. of Idaho dropout, topped the 8,400-point mark over 10
events on the activity's complex points-for-performance
scales, something that never happened before in this land.
   Johnson's 8,600 was best, and it would have been an
American record under recently set standards to allow for
revised javelin specifications if a couple of its components
weren't wind-aided. The score topped the 8,488 points that
won Christian Schenk of East Germany the 1988 Olympic gold
medal, and was the best anywhere for the intervening two
years.
   O'Brien collected 8,483 points, and his performance was
even more noteworthy on a number of grounds. This was his
first national meet, and only the eighth decathlon he'd
completed. Unlike most of the elite field of 17, he had no
major U.S. or collegiate titles in his gym bag.
   He was, moreover, a spotty collegiate performer, due to
injuries, alcohol and drug problems, and, relatedly, an
academic record than left him mostly ineligible for sports.
"Let's just say I was more interested in partying than
studying," says the engaging young man, whose father was
black and mother Finnish, and who was adopted by a Klamath
Falls, Ore., couple named O'Brien at age two.
   But the 6-foot-3, 185-pounder was a multiple-event state
high school track champ in Oregon, and finally got his
decathlon act together in April by scoring 8,267 points at an
invitational meet at Washington State University. That was
the ninth-best score for any American, ever.
   "He has the skills to be a great decathlete, and he's got
the perfect temperament, too. By that I mean he can shrug off
a bad performance and be right back on track a few minutes
later," says Mike Keller, his coach at Idaho. "Dan has lacked
maturity and focus in the past, but he's developing them, and
he's very coachable. If you lead him, he'll quickly run ahead
of you. He picks things up so fast it's scary."
   It's perhaps a coincidence, but Johnson also was no Boy
Scout as a youth, having spent his early high school years in
Missoula, Mont., perpetrating various kinds of mischief. "I
developed my arm throwing rocks at cars, and got my legs in
shape running from the cops," he wryly recalls. Then he moved
to Corvallis in track-crazy Oregon and simultaneously
discovered religion and track and field. They got him through
Azusa Pacific U. and national decathlon titles in 1986 and
'89.
   Despite some ups and downs caused by the injuries that are
inescapable in the grueling discipline (1968 Olympic champ
Bill Toomey once said that behind every successful decathlete
is a good physician), Johnson has been the U.S.'s best in the
event for most of the past five years, and his U.S. record of
8,549 points at the '89 nationals signaled his arrival as an
international force.
   In this competition, though, the vet found himself chasing
the newcomer -- and almost not catching him. O'Brien not only
led the field mathematically through the first day, but also
won four of the five events outright. He ran the 100-meter
dash in 10.4 seconds; long-jumped 26 feet, 4 1/2 inches; put
the shot 50-4 3/4 and high-jumped 6-11 3/4. His long-jump
mark was a world's decathlon best, surprising, he admitted,
even him.
   If O'Brien hadn't sagged a bit in the 400-meter run, the
day's last go, he'd have also set a world's first-day points
record. As it was, his 4,656 was a U.S. mark, led Johnson by
297, and trailed by just 21 the score England's mighty Daley
Thompson posted when he set the world mark of 8,847 at the
1984 Olympics.
   The brawnier Johnson conceded he was impressed, but
pointed toward the morrow, where his strengths in the pole
vault and javelin lay. "I hadn't seen him do his things
before, but he hasn't seen me do mine," he allowed.
   And, verily, that was what came to pass. Johnson
outvaulted O'Brien, 16-4 3/4 to 14-1 1/4, and his javelin
heave of 222-5 was almost 35 feet longer, moving him into
first. O'Brien could have rallied by running the last event
-- the 1,500 meters -- nine seconds faster than Johnson, but
wound up eight seconds slower. While it's remarkable that
anyone could run a mile at all after an 8 1/2-hour day of
dashing and tossing, O'Brien confirmed that his fade bespoke
the need for better conditioning, as well as more time around
the vaulting pit.
   Afterward, champ and challenger faced the press, and waved
the red, white and blue. "Some jaws are gonna drop in Europe
when they see these scores," said Johnson as O'Brien nodded.
"This shows that the decathlon is back in the U.S."
   And when O'Brien predicted he'd improve, Johnson said that
he'd better. "I hope he beats me in '92 at Barcelona, because
if he does it'll mean he's topped 9,000 points," he smiled.

   Six-Nation EFTA Wrestles With Identity Crisis
   As EC Talks Aim at Making Group Less Isolated

   GOTHENBURG, Sweden -- The European Free Trade
Association's six member countries have been celebrating the
organization's 30th anniversary here all this week. But it
could be EFTA's last big bash.
   Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland
-- bound together only by non-membership in the European
Community -- are facing a mid-life identity crisis. The
birthday festivities, launched Monday and lasting through
today, have sought to portray EFTA as a vital and flourishing
group. But the ministers and other officials attending will
have to face a painful morning-after reality: As Europe's
walls come down, EFTA is more isolated than ever.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On one side is a dynamic European Community, moving
forward with its plans for a single market, a single currency
and a closer-knit political system. On the other is a
fast-changing Eastern Europe moving boldly toward the West
and the EC. EFTA's worries about its members' sovereignty and
neutrality seem increasingly anachronistic and irrelevant.
   All of this was supposed to be different. EFTA and the EC
have embarked on a plan for a vast 18-nation market, known as
the European Economic Space, that was to have given EFTA a
new lease on life -- closer, but still separate, from the EC.
But despite some progress in the EES negotiations, many
officials close to the talks say the plan looks unlikely to
produce the kind of boost the EFTA countries need. Meanwhile,
each EFTA country is facing increasing calls from its
businessmen and political leaders to seek full EC membership.
   It was precisely this development that the EC was trying
to avoid. Hoping to give EFTA better access to the EC's
post-1992 market while keeping the mostly-neutral countries
from seeking membership, Commission President Jacques Delors
suggested that the EC and EFTA link their countries into the
EES.
   Though the EES negotiations probably will advance later
this month, their prospects remain cloudy. The EC appears
unwilling to give EFTA much direct say over decision-making
inside the EES. EFTA, for its part, is divided internally,
with one of its members, Austria, already asking for EC
membership. Several others are moving quickly in that
direction.
   The aim of the EES talks is to have a final agreement in
place by Dec. 31, 1992, to correspond with the EC's single
market.
   What EFTA wants is access to the EC market, plus some say
in the creation of laws and regulations that will affect both
its members and the EC. Everything from toy safety, to
electrical standards to the testing of drugs will come under
the EES umbrella. EFTA countries can't be seen as giving all
decision-making powers to EC ministers in areas of such
far-reaching importance.
   Part of the problem lies within the EC. Not everyone in
the EC policy-making process shares President Delors'
enthusiasm for the EES. The European Parliament, in
particular, worries that EFTA countries may end up having
more influence on EC decision-making than do the members of
Parliament themselves.
   Though EFTA ministers probably wouldn't be given seats on
the EC's council of ministers, both sides agree that EFTA
must have some mechanism for making its point of view known
before the ministers make final decisions. One key focus of
the negotiations will be just how direct is such influence
and exactly how it will operate.
   The EES negotiations also must sort out hundreds of cases
where national legislation in EFTA countries conflict with
the EC's own rules -- the so-called acquis communautaire.
Some of the conflicts -- such as the total ban on asbestos
use in Sweden and Norway -- probably will be averted by
granting exemptions from the EC statutes. In many cases, the
EFTA countries may be allowed transitional periods to bring
their laws into compliance.
   A brief look at some of the key countries shows the
difficulties the EES faces:
                                                                                                       

   FINLAND: The revolution in East Europe has opened new
options for Finland, a country with close ties to the East
Bloc and Soviet Union. "A lot has changed in the U.S.S.R. and
Finland as well," says a senior spokesman for the
conservative Kokoomus Party, the biggest member of the ruling
five-party coalition.
   "Changing relations between the superpowers have sparked a
reassessment of our neutrality that is still at an early
stage."
   Finnish corporations are a driving force behind the
political reassessment. "The business community recognized
that the 1992 process would be very important and began
taking steps into Europe several years ago. It took the
politicians a lot longer to catch on," says Katarina
Koivumaa, a Soviet trade specialist at the Finnish Institute
of Foreign Affairs, a Helsinki think tank.
                                                                                                       

   NORWAY: As a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Norway hasn't any qualms about neutrality.
Norway's Social Democrats advocated membership in a 1971
referendum, but the government lost that vote and was ousted
from office. It was a stunning setback that kept the subject
of EC membership taboo for years among politicians in Oslo.
   The question of EC membership remains prickly for
Conservative Premier Jan Syse -- mainly because two centrist
parties in his minority coalition government oppose joining
the EC. The Conservatives favor membership but Mr. Syse has
had to maintain a delicate balance to keep his cabinet
intact.
   Last month, the Social Democrats' leader and former prime
minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, took what many pundits view
as a decisive step toward open support of EC membership. In a
speech to the Storting, or parliament, Mrs. Brundtland warned
that if an EES accord doesn't include a satisfactory
decision-making mechanism, Norway would be better off to
withdraw and apply for EC membership instead.
                                                                                                       

   SWEDEN: Social Democrat Premier Ingvar Carlsson caused a
political storm recently by insisting that EC moves toward
political union make membership even more incompatible with
Swedish neutrality.
   But his move backfired. Rival politicians argued that
Sweden's neutrality isn't defined in the constitution or
other treaty -- and charged that Mr. Carlsson was attempting
to use the neutrality argument to quell deep divisions over
EC policy within the Social Democratic party.
   Industrial leaders are pressing for Sweden to follow
Austria's example and declare its intention to seek full EC
membership. This week, Liberal Party leader Bengt Westerberg
called for Sweden to apply for membership as early as 1993 --
a timetable endorsed by the conservative Moderates, Sweden's
biggest opposition party.
                                                                                                       

   SWITZERLAND: Though Swiss neutrality is among the most
ingrained of any EFTA member, moves are afoot to convince
Swiss citizens that EC membership would be better than their
current status. More and more, Swiss consumers are interested
in a better deal than in preserving the country's sovereignty
and neutrality through economic protectionism.

   Exchange Seeks to Renew
   Investor Confidence

   HONG KONG -- In February, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange
was touting its new interest-rate futures contract as the
"springboard to a new era."
   It turned out to be more like a grim repeat of the past.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The contract received verbal backing from some of this
British colony's biggest banks and brokerage firms, but few
ended up trading it. Last month, trading volume was a meager
144 contracts a day.
   Analysts offer myriad reasons for the lack of trading
interest in the new contract, from poor contract design and
promotion to high trading costs. Some of these problems could
have been avoided and may yet be fixed. Still, the failure of
the contract is just one symptom of a more general malaise
afflicting the Hong Kong Futures Exchange: loss of investor
confidence.
   "Hong Kong lost all credibility internationally" during
the 1987 global stock market crash, says the head of futures
trading in Hong Kong for a U.S. securities company.
   Adding to the exchange's troubles, chief executive officer
Douglas Ford said on Monday that, because of personal
reasons, he will leave his post when his contract expires
this week.
   Exchange executives are disappointed that trading
continues to languish in the two financial futures contracts
offered: the Hang Seng stock-index contract, based on the
leading indicator of the Hong Kong stock market; and the
interest-rate contract, based on the three-month Hong Kong
interbank-offered rate, or Hibor, which is the rate banks
charge one another for U.S.-dollar loans. In hindsight, the
same officials acknowledge that several obvious factors have
hampered the performance of the contracts:
   -- A HK$1.8 billion (US$230 million) emergency bailout,
essential to keeping the futures exchange from collapsing
during the 1987 crash, must be paid off. A levy on every Hang
Seng index contract goes toward repayment of that debt, and
the charge is so high that many brokers don't consider the
contract to be worth trading.
   -- Investors worry that low trading volume prevents them
from jumping in and out of the market quickly. Exchange
officials are aware of the conundrum: They can't build volume
without investors, but investors eschew trading in a
low-volume market.
   -- The exchange required a complete overhaul after the
1987 crash. As the restructuring -- as well as resolution of
corruption charges against former exchange officials --
dragged on, cynicism grew among investors. Now, many don't
want to give futures a chance. (A futures contract is an
agreement to make or take delivery of a commodity or security
at a set price at a later time.)
   When stock markets around the world crashed in October
1987, Hong Kong alone closed its exchanges. At the time,
officials said they hoped the closure would give investors a
chance to assess the relative merits of the market. Instead,
selling pressure built during the four-day closure, and when
the stock and futures markets reopened, prices collapsed. The
debacle sent 40 futures brokers into default and prompted the
emergency bailout put together by a coalition of banks.
   Hundreds of local individual speculators had been betting
that stock prices would continue to rally. Collectively, they
lost millions. Worse yet for confidence in the market, those
who had sold Hang Seng index futures contracts in
anticipation of a decline in stock prices weren't able to
collect the money they should have made after prices fell.
Nearly HK$1 billion in claims remains outstanding, and more
important, the exchange suffered irreparable damage to its
image.
   Active membership has dropped to only about 40 firms from
128 before the crash. Volume in the Hang Seng index contract
-- in its glory days, the second most actively traded
stock-index futures contract in the world, with average daily
volume of 27,000 -- was only 11,710 lots for all of May.
   Analysts say the exchange's inability to stage a rapid
comeback, as much as the 1987 crash itself, is frightening
investors away. The restructuring of the exchange brought in
new leadership, skimmed from successful futures exchanges
around the world. They revamped the exchange's clearing
corporation and revised the trading rules to mirror
international standards.
   All that took time, and as trading slumped and claims
remained unsettled, investors and brokers turned away from
the market. In the end, it was 2 1/2 years before the
revamped exchange brought out the three-month Hibor contract,
the first new contract to be offered since the crash. The
contract gives traders the chance to buy or sell a contract
on the Hibor rate at a specified price on a set date in the
future. The three-month Hibor rate is now about 9.5%.
   The start-up date was pushed back several times while the
exchange spent months refining the contract specifications
and obtaining government approval. During the delays,
enthusiasm waned, though officials offered assurances that
they were only trying to ensure that they got the contract
right.
   Because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar,
banks already were using well-developed contracts in
Singapore and at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to hedge
their Hong Kong-dollar risk. Knowing that, exchange officials
in Hong Kong consulted with the colony's biggest banks to
design a contract that they hoped would better serve these
institutions.
   They then turned around and ignored some of the advice
they had received. As a concession to smaller members of the
futures exchange, the size of the Hibor contract was set at
HK$1 million -- too small for the large banks to use as a
hedging tool.
   "It's tiny," says Christopher Roberts, who heads futures
trading for Anderson Man (Investment Services) Ltd., a
subsidiary of the large British futures brokerage firm E.D. &amp;
F. Man Ltd. "The contract is even more ridiculous than the
Hang Seng index contract in terms of size." As with the Hibor
contract, brokers often complain that the Hang Seng contract
is too small.
   Volume in the Hibor contract met exchange officials'
expectations in the initial weeks of trading, more because
those expectations were extremely modest than because of any
scramble to trade the contract. Indeed, banks were never
convinced that trading volume was sufficient to offer viable
opportunities for getting in and out of positions quickly,
and volume in the Hibor contract soon began to slide.
   In an interview before Monday's announcement of his
pending departure, Mr. Ford said the Hibor contract will soon
be increased to HK$5 million to catch bankers' interest. He
also promised improvements in the Hang Seng index contract,
including a reduction in levies, an increase in trading
limits and a doubling of the price increment, so that the
cost of every lot traded is lower. It now costs HK$86 to
trade one contract, and the minimum price movement in the
contract yields only HK$50. At most other futures exchanges,
the cost of a single trade is 10% to 15% of the minimum price
fluctuation.
   The exchange is arguing to its new regulator, the
Securities and Futures Commission, that the levy must be
reduced to generate enough volume to save the contract.

   N.V. Philips Sees Profit Declining
   In 2nd Period, `Very Low' for Year

   Amid Management Shift,
   Warning Comes in Bid
   To Regain Credibility

   EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- N.V. Philips, struggling to
regain credibility in the midst of a management shake-up,
warned that its second-quarter profit will fall "appreciably"
and that full-year results will be "very low."
   The Dutch electronics giant's warning sent its shares down
5% when trading opened Thursday on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange. The shares closed at 32.10 guilders ($16.89), down
from 33.60 guilders Wednesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said the warning wasn't surprising, given the
company's weak first-quarter results and the likelihood that
the new management team wants to get all of the bad news out
as quickly as possible. "The company is in a heavy storm,"
Fabian Koning of Bank Mees &amp; Hope N.V. said.
   Philips said its second-quarter warning was based on the
company's performance in April and May, but it refused to
elaborate on where the problems lay. In last year's second
quarter, the company had profit before extraordinary items of
197 million guilders.
   For the year, Philips said, provisions for restructuring
costs will cause the company's "net result" to be "at a very
low level." A spokesman declined to comment on whether this
means a loss is possible. Philips had 1989 profit of 1.37
billion guilders, on sales of 57.22 billion guilders, but
much of the earnings reflected the sale of a Paris building
and other one-time items.
   Analysts said second-quarter results probably are being
hurt by continued losses in the computer division and by a
sudden drop in sales in Brazil, where economic austerity
measures are putting severe limits on consumer spending. "The
Brazilian consumer just stopped buying," Chris Honnor, an
analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, said. Latin
America accounted for 18% of Philips's operating profit last
year, and Brazil is the company's main market in that region.
   Philips promised more details about results on July 2,
when shareholders are to meet in Eindhoven to approve a new
management lineup. In the most important change, Cornelis van
der Klugt will step down as chairman July 1, a year ahead of
schedule, to make way for Jan Timmer, head of the consumer
products division.
   Mr. van der Klugt resigned to take responsibility for a
loss of investor confidence, resulting from the company's
failure to warn of a collapse in first-quarter profit before
extraordinary items to six million guilders from the
year-earlier 223 million guilders. When that result was
posted May 3, Philips shares tumbled 11%. A group of U.S.
holders later filed a lawsuit against Philips, alleging the
company had misled investors about its prospects. Philips has
declined to comment on the merits of the suit, but it seems
determined to improve its record on earnings forecasts.
   Philips has long been notorious for springing nasty
surprises on the stock market. Only two months ago, the
company was still predicting 1990 profit would rise.
   The company's biggest problem areas recently have been in
semiconductors and computers, which produced what Philips
described as "hundreds of millions of guilders" in losses
last year.
   Analysts believe Philips is burdened by large inventories
of computers at a time when margins are being squeezed
severely. They also say Philips is probably losing market
share, as its well-publicized problems shake customer
confidence.
   Earlier this week, Philips said it had ended talks on
cooperating with Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. of Italy in the
computer business. Philips said it was still talking to other
possible partners. Many analysts argue that the company's
computer division is too small and unfocused to survive on
its own.
   Dataquest Europe estimated Philips's share of the European
personal computer market at 2.2% in 1989. Philips doesn't
provide separate revenue figures for computers, but IDC
Nederland put Philips's European sales of personal computers,
minicomputers, printers, software and related products last
year at about $1.7 billion. Nearly all of the company's
computer sales are in Europe.
   In the semiconductor area, Philips has been hit by an
industrywide slump and slower-than-expected sales of its
one-megabit static random access memory chips, in which it
has invested heavily.
   Analysts are eagerly awaiting the July 2 meeting, in hopes
that Mr. Timmer, the chairman-designate, will explain how he
intends to turn the company around. Kleinwort's Mr. Honnor
said the new management team is likely to try to "clear the
decks" by making heavy provisions for restructuring costs
this year, setting the company up for better results in 1991.
   In the past three years, Philips spent a total of 1.34
billion guilders to cover early retirements, plant closings
and other restructuring costs. And it closed about 75
factories, bringing the world-wide total to about 350. The
work force has fallen to 300,000 from 342,000 in 1987, partly
through the sale of operations.
   Though Philips has been trying to focus its activities
better, it still makes a huge array of products, including
lamps, stereo equipment, compact disks, television sets,
clocks, vacuum cleaners, garage-door openers, printed circuit
boards, military equipment and medical-diagnostic imaging
products.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Many Firms, Wary of Touchy Civil-Rights Issues,
   Keep Silent as Business Groups Seek Bill's Defeat

   WASHINGTON -- Pete Lunnie of the Fair Employment Coalition
is lobbying vigorously against the civil-rights bill
currently before Congress. His is one of many pro-business
associations that are fighting the bill, which would assist
employees who sue for discrimination.
   But one of the most prestigious companies in the
coalition, International Business Machines Corp., isn't
actively participating in the battle. While "some elements of
the legislation give us cause for concern," says IBM
spokesman Michael Dutton, the company chooses not to lobby
directly against the bill, due for a Senate floor vote later
this month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   IBM's stance underscores a problem facing opponents of the
civil-rights bill: Put off by the touchiness and complexity
of the legal issues involved, many businesses are sitting
this fight out. And that bolsters the already-strong
prospects for congressional approval this year.
   "There are so many gray areas," concedes Mr. Lunnie, an
intense, thin man who as director of employee relations for
the National Association of Manufacturers has organized many
pro-business coalitions on labor issues. "It's an emotional
issue, no question about it."
   Lobbyists for business associations note that many of the
companies they represent are unwilling to take a public stand
on the civil-rights measure. "None of my companies have been
lobbying the bill," says lobbyist Kathy Mance of the National
Retail Federation. Explains U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbyist
Nancy Fulco: "It's incredibly difficult for anybody to take a
stance against a bill with civil rights in its title."
   But supporters of the anti-discrimination bill offer a
different explanation for the muted response by business:
Many companies are not strongly opposed, and some may even
favor it. "I do not believe the business community is
monolithic" on civil rights, says Ralph Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, which
is spearheading the lobbying effort in favor of the bill.
   In fact, both views appear to be correct: While some
businesses choose to avoid public battle on this issue out of
fear, others are silent because they don't object to the
bill.
   One business spokesman says his company is keeping quiet
because it doesn't want to appear opposed to "motherhood and
the American flag," or insensitive to "the pain and the
suffering that led to the original civil-rights act of the
1960s."
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., the San Francisco-based,
investor-owned utility company, submitted favorable testimony
about two of the bill's more controversial sections when the
Senate held hearings last March. "There is little danger that
an absurd or onerous standard will develop" on hiring
practices, personnel officer William Burns told the Labor and
Human Resources Committee.
   Touted by supporters as the most significant civil-rights
measure in more than 20 years, the bill, sponsored by Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D.,
Calif.), was written in response to a series of Supreme Court
decisions in recent years limiting the scope of
employment-discrimination lawsuits. It would tilt the balance
of power back toward plaintiffs in several ways.
   One provision would extend to nonracial minorities and
women the compensatory and punitive damages already available
to those suffering racial discrimination. Another would
require that employers sued for discrimination demonstrate
that hiring requirements bear a "substantial and
demonstrative" relation to the job.
   Lobbyists for business associations say there's nothing
unusual about individual companies keeping a low profile in
congressional battles over labor issues. Asked to provide
this reporter with a list of businesses that belong to his
coalition, Mr. Lunnie said, "I've never been involved in a
coalition where a lot of its membership has been provided to
the press."
   Not every member of Mr. Lunnie's coalition is
publicity-shy about the bill. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co., whose chairman, Robert Allen, got interested in the
issue while heading a Business Roundtable task force on
personnel issues, sent an executive to the White House to
argue for changes. AT&amp;T believes "the current bill
overreaches, and it can be corrected in a manner that's fair
to all involved," according to Gerald M. Lowrie, senior vice
president for government affairs.
   This week, Mr. Lunnie arranged for six chief executive
officers, including Chairman Allen Jacobson of Minnesota
Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., to meet with key legislators and
White House staff on the issue. Mr. Lunnie declined to name
most of the individuals and companies involved, but said they
represented businesses of various sizes in the service,
construction, manufacturing, and consumer-products
industries.
   Mr. Lunnie says his group is making a special effort not
to appear "ham-handed" in its lobbying efforts. "The approach
has to be as delicate as the subject matter itself," he says.
   An example of this low-key approach is a letter sent by
the coalition of companies and lobbying groups last March to
members of Congress. Signed by more than 80 associations and
companies, including IBM, Exxon Corp.'s Exxon Co. U.S.A. unit
and Boise Cascade Corp., the letter doesn't call for outright
opposition to the bill. Instead, it expresses concern that
Congress is "rushing too quickly in judgment" on a bill that
"would dramatically, and, perhaps, unwarrantedly, change the
character of the nation's equal employment laws."
   The civil-rights bill's swift movement through the Senate
is a decided advantage to its proponents. Introduced last
February after much lobbying by Mr. Neas and other
civil-rights advocates, it quickly picked up strong support
in both houses of Congress. "They have been ramrodding it
through," complains Susan Meisinger, a lobbyist for the
Society for Human Resource Management, an organization
representing personnel managers.
   Mr. Lunnie says business groups began their lobbying
effort in February, shortly after the bill's contents were
made known. At a meeting of Washington corporate and
business-association representatives, he says, it quickly
became clear that business groups would have to oppose the
measure. The coalition was formed shortly thereafter.
   The business groups weren't able to move sooner, Mr.
Lunnie says, because they didn't want to "sit there and take
shots" at what might be in the bill. "Quite frankly," he
says, "it's an extremely complex law."

   Red Army Fugitives Lose Their Haven
   As East Germans Join Fight on Terrorism

   FRANKFURT -- The mug shots of Susanne Albrecht and Inge
Viett have hung on the walls of West German post offices for
more than a decade.
   Now, the elusive terrorist suspects are sitting in East
German jails awaiting extradition to West Germany for trial.
Their story adds a footnote to the Cold War annals of a
divided Germany.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Millions of West German marks and untold hours were spent
trying to find the two women, among the 20 or so members of
the Red Army Faction terror group who have been at the top of
West Germany's most-wanted lists since the 1970s.
   West German police last arrested a top RAF member in 1982;
the other suspects vanished. But the killing of public
officials and industry leaders kept up through the 1980s. The
most recent was the murder in November of Deutsche Bank AG
Chairman Alfred Herrhausen, whose car was blown up by a
roadside bomb.
   Police were embarrassed for years by their inability to
track down prime suspects. Now they have some reason to know
why: At least some disappeared into East Germany with the
cooperation of the East German Ministry for State Security,
or Stasi. East German authorities now say they suspect Stasi
granted haven -- and possibly new identities -- to fugitive
West German terrorists.
   The disclosures triggered outrage in Bonn. West Germany's
opposition Social Democratic Party spoke bitterly of
"veritable terror nests" in East Germany and demanded a
parliamentary investigation.
   Many West German authorities aren't particularly
surprised. "We relayed our first indications that RAF members
could be living in East Germany to East Berlin in 1986, but
didn't get any response," said Hartmut Jaufmann, spokesman
for West Germany's Federal Criminal Office. "Since the
changes of last year, they've become much more cooperative."
   With German unification looming, East German authorities
are throwing out the dragnet. East German Interior Minister
Peter-Michael Diestel sharply criticized the old Communist
regime and pledged his full support in rooting out any
terrorists hiding in East Germany.
   "I also will clear up as much as possible this diabolical
connection between the Ministry for State Security and the
terror scene," Mr. Diestel declared during a visit to Bonn
this week.
   Speaking yesterday at a news conference in East Berlin,
Mr. Diestel said East Germany's top Communist leaders knew of
the Stasi program for fugitive terrorists. He said
questioning of Ms. Albrecht disclosed that RAF ringleaders in
1980 urged her to flee because she had become a security
risk. He said that on arriving in East Germany, Ms. Albrecht
said she was told that East Germany disapproves of the RAF's
methods, but supports the gang's "anti-imperialist
orientation."
   Ms. Albrecht's shadowy existence ended June 6, when East
German police, working with West German counterterror
officials, arrested the 39-year-old in her East Berlin
apartment, where she lived under a new name.
   Ms. Albrecht, the daughter of a prosperous Hamburg
attorney, is suspected of complicity in the 1977 murder of
Dresdner Bank AG Chairman Hans-Juergen Ponto, who was a close
friend of the Albrecht family. The banker reportedly admitted
Ms. Albrecht and her accomplices into his home after
recognizing Ms. Albrecht. He was shot five times, apparently
by one of Ms. Albrecht's associates.
   After assuming her new East German identity in 1980, she
apparently broke ties with the RAF, married an East German
and gave birth to a daughter. Authorities say she was
identified in her solid middle-class hideaway after screening
East German immigration records. But there also is
speculation that Ms. Albrecht was identified by a former
Stasi official.
   The second coup came Tuesday night, when East German
police arrested Ms. Viett in her apartment in the city of
Magdeburg after being tipped off by a neighbor. The
46-year-old former kindergarten teacher was on the
most-wanted list for a series of terror attacks, including
the 1974 murder of a West Berlin judge and the 1981 shooting
of a French policeman while escaping arrest in Paris.
   Both Ms. Albrecht and Ms. Viett are believed to have
broken years ago with the RAF's bloody campaign against what
they call the military-industrial complex. Mr. Diestel said
that Ms. Albrecht kept in touch with the Stasi until the
collapse of the Communist regime late last year.
   Other leads on terrorists are beginning to surface. A
Dresden newspaper reported that another RAF suspect, Silke
Maier-Witt, had lived in that East German city. Ms.
Maier-Witt is wanted in connection with the 1977 kidnapping
and murder of Hanns Martin Schleyer, a West German industry
leader. There also are reports that Sigrid Sternebeck, sought
in connection with an attempted bazooka attack on the West
German Attorney General's Office in 1977, could be in East
Germany.

   EC Offers Proposal
   On Farm Subsidies
   At GATT Talks

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community put forward proposals
on how to reduce farm subsidies world-wide, but the proposals
weren't expected to end the deadlock in international talks
on agriculture.
   A spokesman for the EC Commission said the proposals were
presented in a working paper to a 32-nation meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland, on agriculture negotiations within the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Other participants,
including the U.S., also presented papers at a session
Wednesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the spokesman called the EC proposals "a step
forward," other people involved in the trade discussions
expressed doubts. They said the EC paper developed some ideas
put forward earlier in the year but broke little or no new
ground.
   For example, the paper reiterated in some detail the
12-nation EC's argument that there should be a "rebalancing"
of import tariffs on agricultural goods so that cuts in
tariffs on some products could be accompanied by increases
elsewhere. The EC contends that as long as the "global" level
of subsidies is reduced, some increases should be allowed.
   This approach has been flatly rejected by the U.S. and
other countries, such as Australia, that insist the talks
shouldn't lead to any tariff increases at all. Washington has
been emphatic on this point because EC moves to increase
tariffs would affect U.S. exports of oilseeds and cereal
substitutes, which currently enter the EC with little or no
import duty charged.
   The EC paper also spelled out in more detail the EC's
response to a U.S. proposal for all agricultural protection
programs to be converted into tariffs. The community has said
it would be willing to accept such a development as long as
the tariffs included a "corrective" mechanism to take into
account factors such as fluctuations in world commodity
prices.
   People from outside the EC said the paper confirmed their
expectations that the new system proposed by Brussels would
be similar to the variable levy that currently protects EC
farmers from the impact of lower world prices. "It looks like
the variable levy by another name," one person said.
   The EC has come under strong pressure in the GATT talks to
dismantle its complex and expensive agricultural support
system, known as the Common Agricultural Policy. But EC
negotiators are hampered by their mandate from EC
governments, which specifically states that the principles of
that policy mustn't be violated.
   The U.S., Australia and some Scandinavian nations put
forward papers spelling out agricultural support programs
that they said shouldn't be subject to cuts. These are aimed
at setting strict criteria to ensure that government aid to
farmers doesn't distort trade.

   WASHINGTON -- The federal government took legal action
that could shut down Marine Shale Processors Inc., operator
of the largest incinerator of hazardous wastes in the
country.
   The Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency
filed a civil suit in federal court in Louisiana seeking a
permanent injunction against Marine Shale.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The privately owned Amelia, La., company, which claims to
use a revolutionary treatment process that can recycle
hazardous waste into a benign ash for use in landfills, also
faces penalties of up to $50 million, a Bush administration
official said.
   The government claims the company is illegally operating
without a waste-treatment permit that requires strict
operating procedures. It challenges Marine Shale's argument
that it is exempt from hazardous waste-treatment regulations
because it is a recycler.
   Government tests last year of ash samples from Marine
Shale turned up high levels of heavy metals, such as lead,
which officials are concerned could leak into groundwater.
   An attorney for the company couldn't be reached for
comment. Besides claiming an exemption, Marine Shale
attorneys have said the company is deterred from seeking a
hazardous-waste permit because it would have to shut down for
three or more years while its application was being
processed.
   The hazardous waste-treatment industry has been up in arms
over Marine Shale, whose cheaper rates have enticed away
business since 1985 from competitors such as Waste Management
Inc. and Rollins Environmental Services Inc. Major oil,
chemical and mining companies are among Marine Shale's
customers.
   Last year, Marine Shale pleaded guilty to a
hazardous-waste felony count and other charges and paid a $1
million criminal fine.
   In addition, a congressional panel held hearings into what
it called "sham recyclers," focusing on Marine Shale. Company
owner Jack Kent countered with television ads showing off his
treatment technology.

   It looks as if Republican Senator David Durenberger is
about to have his book thrown at him. The Senate Ethics
Committee ended its public hearings this week after Mr.
Durenberger said he wouldn't deny he had violated Senate
rules but claimed his motivations in a book-promotion deal
had not been sinister.
   The Ethics Committee may deal harshly with Senator
Durenberger, partly to show it is no longer a toothless
watchdog. It'd be unfortunate, though, if this action became
a cover for treading more lightly in the ongoing Keating Five
and Al D'Amato investigations, the real tests of whether
Congress is ending its double standard on ethics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The charges against Senator Durenberger are serious, but
unlike the other two cases don't raise larger ethical issues.
The Senator was accused of using his paid promotional
appearances for Piranha Press, the publisher of his two
books, as a way of collecting disguised honoraria for
speeches. Those, unlike regular stipends for a column or
radio show, are limited by Senate rules. The circumstances
resemble those surrounding former House Speaker Jim Wright's
infamous junk book. Mr. Durenberger is also accused of
accepting Senate reimbursement for stays at a condo he partly
owned, and backdating documents related to its sale.
   Senator Durenberger's turbulent personal life may have
contributed to this and other unethical behavior. In 1988 he
was rebuked by the Ethics Committee for casually revealing
CIA secrets at a Florida fund-raiser. The Ethics Committee
cannot ignore a consistent pattern of rules violations. It
should, however, recognize that the Senate's tangled rules on
outside income invite evasion. Better that the Senate set an
overall cap on outside earned income from whatever source and
then require full disclosure.
   The Keating Five and Al D'Amato cases are far larger in
their ethical implications, akin to many Goliaths looming
over David. Both cases go to the heart of Washington's
"prevailing community standards." Those dictate that actions
most Americans would view as unacceptable are, if done inside
the Beltway, merely the peculiar customs that the people who
make the nation's laws choose to follow.
   The six Senators -- two Republicans and four Democrats --
are all accused of using improper influence on behalf of
wealthy backers under the rubric of "constituent service."
Senator D'Amato is accused of steering HUD contracts to his
friends. The Ethics Committee is leery of challenging the
right of Members to twist arms and pervert policy on behalf
of contributors; the practice is endemic to the way
Washington works today.
   At least one Ethics Committee member seems to have made up
his mind. Senator Terry Sanford recently told a town meeting
in Statesville, N.C., that the Keating Five "did exactly what
every Senator is called on to do every day."
   That is the legal defense offered by Senator Alan
Cranston, one of the Keating Five. As precedent, he points
out the House Ethics Committee excused Speaker Wright's
blocking of regulatory action against insolvent Texas S&amp;Ls as
merely part of his legislative "technique."
   The Ethics Committee may be tempted to absolve such
"constituent service" as routine, but it may not have the
option. The public, in ever-increasing numbers, is in an ugly
mood over the S&amp;L mess. Polls show the percentage of those
with a positive view of congressional ethics has dropped 10
points in the past year. President Bush scores badly in a new
Hotline Poll on his handling of the S&amp;L crisis, but
Congress's ratings are worse. Only 9% of those polled have a
positive view, 64% are negative.
   It's not surprising that Ethics Committee members won't
finish the Keating Five or D'Amato cases before this fall's
elections. But this gives them a lot of time to mull Senator
Durenberger's closing observation during his speech to the
committee this week: "Public attitudes about political ethics
are changing, and we have to change with them or be swept
aside."

   National pride is on the rise in Japan, and economic
nationalism is growing in the U.S. Nonetheless, two new polls
show that citizens in both countries are often more critical
of their own societies than of each other's.
   Which society is more intolerant of other races? In a
recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, a plurality of
registered U.S. voters -- 46% -- point to America, while a
separate Journal poll in Japan found 49% of the Japanese name
their own country. Which society has more of a long-term
perspective? Fifty-one percent of Americans say Japan, but
only 10% of Japanese agree.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Americans, by a big margin of 65% to 23%, say Japan has
stronger family values, while 49% of Japanese say that honor
goes to the U.S. Each side thinks its own society is the more
selfish.
   In addition to this mutual modesty, two other strong
impressions emerge from the polls. One it that there is broad
agreement between the two countries on several societal
traits. The other is that Japanese are much more likely to
see no difference between Japan and the U.S.
   For example, respondents in both countries generally agree
that the U.S. is more devoted to democracy, free trade and
free speech than Japan; that Americans are happier with their
lives than Japanese; and that Japan is more nationalistic.
   But while 89% of Americans think the U.S. is more devoted
to democracy, only 37% of Japanese think so; 39% of Japanese
say there's no difference between the two countries' level of
devotion to democracy, while 15% give the nod to Japan.
   Similarly, 93% of Americans and 39% of Japanese think the
U.S. is more devoted to free speech, while 40% of Japanese
see no difference between the two countries. Fully 70% of
Americans think the U.S. is more "honest in dealing with
others and others' countries"; 26% of Japanese agree, but 50%
see no difference (only 15% of Japanese think Japan is more
honest).
   The U.S. poll was conducted for the Journal and NBC by
political pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter. The poll in
Japan was conducted for the Journal by Nippon Research.

   EC Decides Not to Target

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community's competition
commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, decided to take no further
action against Britain's tied-pub system, already the subject
of national measures to promote competition.
   After a yearlong review of the EC's beer market, Sir Leon
concluded there was no evidence to justify a crackdown on
tied-house arrangements, which will continue to have an
exemption from EC competition rules that expires in 1997. In
the tied-house system, breweries own or control public houses
and limit the types of beer the pubs may sell.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the commission expressed concern about inadequate
competition in Britain, it decided to wait to evaluate
measures recently imposed by Britain on the beer industry
before deciding whether EC action is necessary.
   The commission said 62% of Britain's beer sales pass
through the tied-house system. In the other five EC countries
that have tied pubs -- Belgium, West Germany, France,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands -- this figure is below 40%.
   But the commission plans a further investigation into
licensing agreements between major brewers, under which
breweries in different countries grant each other exclusive
rights to brew and market beers. Such accords can lead to
market sharing, reducing the scope for imports and blocking
the entry into the market of major competitors, according to
the EC competition authorities.

   CLEVELAND -- Mr. Coffee Inc. said a federal court in
Delaware denied an application by Farberware Inc., New York,
to enjoin Mr. Coffee from marketing a device that brews
coffee in a microwave oven.
   The court rejected a claim by Farberware that Mr. Coffee's
Quick Brew unit was too similar in appearance to Farberware's
MicroBrew coffeemaker. The court said there was no likelihood
that consumers would confuse the two products.

   Mr. Coffee produces automatic coffeemakers and filters.
Farberware, a housewares producer, is a unit of Hanson PLC, a
British industrial concern.
   Farberware said it will "aggressively pursue" other legal
remedies. The company said its product is "distinctive," with
a position in the market that Mr. Coffee is unfairly
attempting to infringe upon.

   Honeywell Seeks
   A Halt of Imports
   Of Minolta Product

   WASHINGTON -- Honeywell Inc. petitioned the International
Trade Commission to halt imports of Minolta cameras with
automatic-focusing devices, charging that these products
infringe Honeywell patents.
   Honeywell's action is a surprising departure from its
earlier advocacy of harmonious relations with Japan. But
Christopher Steffen, Honeywell's vice president and chief
financial officer, said that seeking the ITC action is one of
the few alternatives left for Honeywell to recover "hundreds
of millions of dollars in lost royalties" for its pioneering
work on auto-focusing technology.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ITC petition brings further pressure on Minolta Camera
Co., the Japanese maker, to settle Honeywell's separate civil
suit seeking damages for alleged patent infringement, misuse
of trade secrets and breach of contract. The case has been
dragging on for nearly three years in a New Jersey district
court.
   In the suit, Honeywell claims that it confidentially
provided Minolta with information for making auto-focus
modules with the understanding that the Osaka manufacturer
would later incorporate Honeywell-made ones in its cameras.
The suit also charges that while absorbing this know-how
Minolta secretly conducted its own parallel development
effort and, in 1985, introduced products using modules based
on Honeywell technology.
   If the ITC accepts the petition, Honeywell could win
relief in 12 months. Honeywell doesn't expect the New Jersey
suit to go to trial until 1992.
   An ITC ruling favoring Honeywell would be a severe blow to
Minolta. The Japanese company's popular Maxxum models, which
feature the disputed devices, account for much of its $1
billion in annual camera sales world-wide. Moreover, the
trade impact could be even broader if Honeywell takes action
against 15 other Japanese camera makers that allegedly
obtained the same technology under similar confidential
arrangements. Honeywell said these firms include Canon Inc.,
Asahi Optical Co., Nippon Kokaku K.K. and Olympus Optical Co.
   Minolta dismissed Honeywell's charges as "baseless,"
claiming that they ignore an earlier history of development
in auto-focus cameras, including "significant breakthroughs"
by Minolta. "As we have argued in federal court -- the proper
forum for this dispute -- we believe the Honeywell patents
claims in question are invalid and unenforceable," the
company said.
   "Honeywell, which does not make or sell cameras, is asking
the U.S. government to prevent Minolta -- and perhaps every
other major camera manufacturer in the world -- from selling
cameras in the U.S.," Minolta said. The company also charged
Honeywell with attempting to breach a 1988 agreement to
confine the dispute in the New Jersey court.
   Honeywell's complaint is likely to resonate in Washington
because of the Bush administration's concern about allegedly
unfair business practices of other Japanese companies.
Honeywell insists, though, that its problems with Minolta and
possibly with other Japanese camera makers are exceptions to
its otherwise productive dealings in Japan. "We've had
technology arrangements with other Japanese companies and
ended up with royalty agreements," Honeywell said.

   Computer Firm Says Sales
   Are Soft In U.S., U.K.
   In Fiscal Fourth Quarter

   MAYNARD, Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp. told analysts
that earnings estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter ending
June 30 appear "too optimistic" because of soft sales in the
U.S. and the United Kingdom.
   The announcement led to a mild sell-off of Digital's often
volatile stock. The shares fell $1.75 to $86.375 in heavy New
York Stock Exchange composite trading of 1,171,700 shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some analysts said the softness in the U.K. may presage
poor results for other computer companies as well since
European sales have been a bright spot for many large
computer companies.
   "I wouldn't be surprised to see some cuts in other stocks
before we're finished," with this quarter, said Stephen
Smith, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
   A Digital spokesman said most analysts had been
forecasting net income of $1.60 to $1.80 a share for the
fourth quarter compared with a year earlier when the company
earned $2.51 a share, on net income of $313.2 million. After
the announcement, analysts said they weren't sure how far to
cut their Digital estimates but some trimmed them to as low
as $1.25 a share.
   James M. Osterhoff, Digital's vice president-finance, told
a Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. conference that "our current
rate of profitability doesn't meet the expectations of our
investors -- or ourselves." He added: "The U.S. market
continues to be sluggish for us, and certain international
markets are experiencing softness, such as the U.K. where
high interest rates are cutting business expansion."
   Jay P. Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter, said that
besides the economic problems in major markets Digital has
been caught in a bad product cycle. At the high end,
customers are awaiting deliveries of the VAX 9000, Digital's
first powerful mainframe computer. Although originally
expected early in the fourth quarter, Digital now says there
won't be any significant revenue from the VAX 9000 until
fiscal 1991. And many analysts don't expect much impact until
the second quarter of that year.
   In addition, Mr. Stevens said, sales of Digital's small
VAX 3000 computers, which had been strong earlier this year,
have weakened recently because customers expect Digital to
announce replacement products next month at its DECWorld
trade show. That weakness "is breaking the camel's back," he
said.
   Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities, said investors hadn't been counting on a strong
fourth quarter for Digital and had been looking to 1991
instead. "If it had been a giant surprise the stock would
have come down 30%," she said.
   Nevertheless, some analysts cut their estimates for fiscal
1991 as well because they expect the economic problems to
reduce benefits from the new product cycle. Mr. Stevens said
he expects fiscal 1990 pershare earnings of about $4.10,
rising to $8.35 in fiscal 1991. PaineWebber's Mr. Smith
predicted fiscal 1991 net of about $7.50 a share.
   In fiscal 1989, net income was $1.07 billion, or $8.45 a
share, on revenue of $12.74 billion.

   Bad Organization Ambushes Generals

   Why do good armies fail?
   This is the question the authors of "Military Misfortunes:
The Anatomy of Failure in War" (Macmillan/Free Press, 296
pages, $22.95) seek to answer by analyzing five campaigns
that resulted in notable defeats (and, of course, notable
victories for the other side).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The failure of the British landing at Gallipoli designed
to break the stalemate on the Western Front in 1915; the
shocking shipping losses we suffered from German U-boats in
1942; the rout of our Eighth Army from its advanced positions
near the Yalu River in Korea in 1950; the surprise and defeat
of the Israelis in 1973; and the catastrophic collapse of the
French in 1940. These are the "lost victories" examined by
Eliot A. Cohen, a strategic analyst at Harvard's Olin
Institute, and John Gooch, a British professor of military
history.
   By misfortunes, the authors mean "failures attributable
neither to gross disproportions in odds nor to egregious
incompetence on the part of the victim nor yet to
extraordinary skill on the part of the victor." Indeed, in
all five instances, the forces seemed balanced in the
beginning. So what determined the outcome?
   Not surprisingly, Messrs. Cohen and Gooch did not find one
specific cause nor any particularly discernible common thread
fitting all five case histories. But they do single out one
principal culprit: poor military organization. In their view,
organizational failure often was more culpable than specific
decisions made during battle. Indeed, both authors reject
what they call the "Man in the Dock" theory and generally
absolve individual commanders from singlehandedly engineering
their defeats, even though some of their actions may have
been dismally inadequate.
   A good example is Gen. Ian Hamilton, commander at
Gallipoli. Once he failed to receive the corps commanders he
had wanted, Hamilton seems to have lacked the imagination to
rethink his options and further exacerbated the situation
with his hands-off approach to military command. A concept
well-established in the upper echelons of the British army,
it also was exemplified by Lt. Gen. Frederick Stopford, who
"commanded" the IX Corps at Suvla Bay by so remote a control
that he used small boats to communicate with his troops while
he remained at sea.
   Even Gen. Maurice-Gustave Gamelin, who commanded the
French forces in 1940 with such passive incompetence, escapes
total blame. Among other things, "captured intelligence
information was often transmitted too slowly up the chain of
command to have any operational effect," the authors suggest.
   So it comes as no particular surprise that Gen. Douglas
MacArthur is specifically absolved from responsibility for
the bloody defeats the Chinese inflicted on the United
Nations forces at Yalu River in 1950. The general often is
blamed for provoking the Chinese by advancing on the Yalu,
but the authors take a broader view: "Once the U.N., and
above all the American government, had adopted the goal of
unifying Korea, it set in motion the Chinese intervention.
MacArthur shared, no doubt, in the making of a flawed policy,
but he did not initiate or determine it."
   But most often the authors come back to their theory that
we should seek the causes of defeat in the characteristics of
military organization, the climate in which it must work, its
all too frequent emphasis on lessons from past wars, and
inherent structural rigidities.
   This does not really explain why some military forces win
and some lose -- but adaptability, ingenuity, the flexibility
derived from living in free societies (although dictatorships
do win from time to time), and finally the will to win can
overcome structural organizational problems.
   Messrs. Cohen and Gooch have done their job well. They
have mastered their sources, used considerable imagination in
choosing campaigns to study, and developed criteria and
original theories to explain the outcome of the battles
chosen for study.
   Also, despite occasional irregularities of style of
presentation, the book is well-written and generally sound in
judgment. I would quarrel most notably with their view that
it was the French First Army that saved the British at
Dunkirk -- rather than the British Expeditionary Force itself
and the hastily assembled evacuation fleet. Also, I do not
believe the authors attach enough importance to the failure
of democracies to support their military in peacetime, and
the consequent haste and waste inevitably involved in trying
in a few months to make up for years of neglect.
   Still, these are minor quibbles with a book that ably
describes "the problem of command in the age of large and
complicated organizations." It will, I hope, be carefully
studied in schools that prepare our future leaders for battle
and command.

   Ameritech, Bell Atlantic Will Operate
   Under Little Restraint in New Zealand

   Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp.'s successful $2.46
billion bid for New Zealand's state-owned telephone company
will provide an unusual opportunity for both regional Bells
to operate in a market with minimal government restraint.
   Unlike the U.S. telecommunications industry, which is
subject to substantial state and federal regulation, New
Zealand's system is widely perceived as a free-for-all.
Although a few restrictions apply to rate increases, no
government agency is responsible for enforcement of telephone
policies. Customers with grievances generally seek relief by
filing suit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lack of government interference in New Zealand is "one
of the attractions" of buying Telecom Corp., said Louis J.
Rutigliano, Ameritech's executive vice president, corporate
strategy, who was an architect of the joint bid.
   For Ameritech and Bell Atlantic, learning how to operate
in a much less structured environment could help in preparing
for the day when most of the U.S. market will have looser,
incentive-based regulation instead of the traditional
rate-of-return limits on profitability.
   "The New Zealand government took it upon itself in 1987 to
totally deregulate the telecommunications marketplace, which
is something we have been espousing in the U.S. for a while,"
Mr. Rutigliano said. "This is a chance for us to understand
what it means and to prepare this company for increasing
competition."
   Telecom, with 16,500 employees, 1.1 million customers and
annual revenue of about $1.3 billion, represents an
attractive prize. The company expects its network to be 90%
digital by the end of this year. The government will keep a
special-rights preference share, locally nicknamed the "Kiwi"
share, that will enable it to influence Telecom's future
ownership structure and ensure that the new owners don't cut
phone service or raise prices too sharply.
   The New Zealand joint-purchase agreement, announced late
Wednesday night, also represents a strategic victory for the
two Bells. Recently, both have intensified their efforts to
gain prominent footholds overseas after failing in their
collaborative bid last year for a license to build and
operate a private cellular-phone system in West Germany.
   The auction of Telecom for the New Zealand government was
managed by CS First Boston Group, a New York investment
banking firm, and the New Zealand firm of Buttle Wilson Ltd.
Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers unit represented Ameritech
and Bell Atlantic in the talks.
   People familiar with the auction process said the
government's decision to choose Ameritech and Bell Atlantic
was strongly influenced by the "cleanness" and simplicity of
their joint bid and by the participation, although initially
only token, of two New Zealand companies.
   As part of the agreement, the Freightways Holdings Ltd.
conglomerate and Fay, Richwhite Holdings Ltd. merchant bank
will buy a stake of less than 1% in Telecom that will
increase to 10% over the next three years. During the same
period, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech will reduce their
combined stake to 49.9% by making a series of public stock
offerings in New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the U.S.,
beginning as early as 1991. Salomon is expected to have a
role in managing those offerings.
   In winning Telecom, the two Bells outmaneuvered several
U.S., Australian, U.K. and New Zealand rivals, including a
joint venture of Southwestern Bell Corp. and OTC Ltd., an
Australian long-distance phone company; Cable &amp; Wireless PLC,
a giant U.K. company that owns Hong Kong Telecom, among other
businesses; Brierley Investments Ltd., a New Zealand
investment firm with stakes in several U.S. industrial
companies; and Fletcher Challenge, a building products and
timber concern that is the largest company in New Zealand.
   People familiar with the bids speculated that Ameritech
and Bell Atlantic prevailed because theirs was a direct,
unencumbered offer for 100% of the company. That apparently
reassured the New Zealand government that it could get a full
price immediately, without having to risk that subsequent
stock offerings might go sour.
   Some people who monitored the deliberations said the
successful bid was priced at about the same amount or only
slightly higher than competing bids. According to these
people, the leading rival was the joint venture of
Southwestern Bell and OTC. That venture apparently didn't
include any New Zealand partners, and it may have bid for
only a 49.9% stake in New Zealand Telecom. There were also
indications that some members of the New Zealand cabinet had
qualms about Australian ownership of part of the country's
phone system.
   Wall Street didn't find encouragement in the news. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ameritech's
shares fell 75 cents to close at $64.25, while Bell
Atlantic's shares slipped 62.5 cents to close at $51.75.
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it placed Bell Atlantic on its
CreditWatch list with negative implications, citing the
company's already heavy debt load and the prospects of
borrowing much more to finance its 50% share of the purchase.
   "This is a good time for us to demonstrate how judicial
restraint affects us," said Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond
Smith, referring to the consent decree that broke up the Bell
System. The decree bars the seven regional Bell companies
from owning the content of information services, from
manufacturing telecommunications equipment and from providing
long-distance service in the U.S.
   Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are expected to seek waivers
to allow them to provide international long-distance service
from New Zealand to the U.S. and its territories. In the
meantime, the pact calls for the New Zealand partners to set
up a separate company to handle that telecommunications
traffic. A spokesman for Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic
said it amounted to less than 3% of Telecom revenue.
   In the U.S., the Bells are also barred from providing
cable television service in their territories, and there is
no such restriction in New Zealand. There is no cable
industry either. Both Bells say no plans have been made, but
cable is a potentially lucrative service that they could
provide as the country's network is upgraded.
   Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are aware that they face some
tension from New Zealanders, many of whom weren't happy with
the idea of selling the phone company to foreigners. "We
weren't known very well, and the government did have to work
with the fact that the local populace wasn't in favor of
selling off an asset such as Telecom" to foreigners, Mr.
Rutigliano of Chicago-based Ameritech said. "But the reality
was there wasn't enough capital in New Zealand to cover such
a large acquisition."

   British Government Says It Won't Help
   Fund High-Speed Rail Link to `Chunnel'

   LONDON -- A shadow is falling across the light at the
British end of the Channel Tunnel.
   Just as prospects brighten for the beleaguered "chunnel,"
Britain risks failing to take full advantage of the
cross-channel link. The Thatcher government's announcement
yesterday that it wouldn't help fund a high-speed rail link
between London and the tunnel has fueled fears that the
country's creaky transportation system will isolate Britain
on the periphery of Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sarah Talbot-Williams, a spokeswoman for the Confederation
of British Industry, Britain's main employers' group says,
"1992 is going to produce a much more competitive market. "If
we don't have the infrastructure to get the goods to Europe,
we'll continue our status as an island."
   Long plagued by soaring costs and drilling delays, the
tunnel now looks set to open on time in June 1993. British
diggers, who once lagged months behind schedule, currently
are just one week behind; their French counterparts are
running three months ahead of plan. And although the
project's estimated cost has soared to #7.66 billion ($13.11
billion) from #4.9 billion, tunnel executives have obtained
underwriting for an equity rights offer and preliminary
agreement for more bank loans to cover the added cost.
   "There will be no more talk of crisis," says Alastair
Morton, chief executive officer of Eurotunnel PLC, the
consortium building the cross-channel link. "The money will
be together this year, and the project will be clear from
there."
   But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and
improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the
tunnel's total benefits. "There is a danger of not being able
to exploit the tunnel to its full potential," says Prof.
Christopher Nash, a transport expert at Leeds University in
Northern England.
   The government's refusal to help fund a fast rail service
between London and the tunnel terminal at Folkestone
culminates an 18-month squabble. European Rail Link Ltd., a
consortium formed last November to build the rail link, had
asked the government to contribute #350 million towards the
total #2.6 billion cost of the link.
   Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson told the House of
Commons that the consortium's plans involved "unacceptable"
risks for taxpayers. He said British Rail, which owns 50% of
the consortium, would consider other options for a fast-rail
link. But no one expects a viable scheme anytime soon.
   Defending the decision, Mrs. Thatcher earlier told
Parliament that the government already had earmarked almost
#2 billion for chunnel-related projects, including #600
million on roads leading to the tunnel and #1.3 billion in
passenger and freight rail services.
   But that didn't satisfy opposition legislators. "Britain
will enter the 21st century with an inadequate 19th-century
railway link," said John Prescott, the Labour Party's
transportation spokesman.
   As a result of Thursday's decision, the journey time to
London from Paris will be about three hours -- 30 minutes
longer than with a high-speed rail link. Passengers boarding
high-speed trains in Paris will zoom at 180 miles an hour
north to Calais, slow to 100 miles an hour through the
tunnel, then crawl at an average of 60 miles an hour across
southeast England's crowded commuter belt.
   "The traffic will now speed through as far as our side of
the tunnel, and then the men with red flags will lead it on
to London," complains Keith Speed, a Conservative member of
Parliament whose constituency is near the tunnel terminal.
   Eurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable
without the high-speed rail link. The tunnel-building
consortium argues that only 39% of its total revenue will
come from direct London-to-Paris trains; the real
money-spinner will be freight traffic hauled by road to the
tunnel, then loaded onto special Eurotunnel wagons for the
journey under the channel.
   "We make more money on road traffic using our tunnel," Mr.
Morton says. "There is in no sense a feeling we must have
that link to make the tunnel successful."
   But Mr. Morton admits he wants to see the high-speed link
built, professing it would divert traffic from southeast
England's clogged roads. The high-speed link "will be a
benefit for us," he says, "but essential for the country."
   Some analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs
better rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry
and air services. "A high-speed link which covers {only} part
of the route proves to be fairly uncompetitive with other
transportation modes," says Bill Steinmetz, vice president of
transport for consultants Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. in
London. "If you're going to build high-speed rail, you have
to decide how to provide complete links. It's like having
part of a house built. It may function, but you do worry
about it."
   The worries don't end in London. North of the capital,
industrialists fear poor railway links will isolate them on
the fringes of the European Community's single market.
   "The Channel Tunnel is a marvelous addition to the
infrastructure," says David Merrill, corporate-affairs
director at Pilkington PLC, the big glass maker based in St.
Helens in Northwest England. But "it's important that the
quality of the rail network and capacity is improved. I don't
think there's any time to lose."

   U.S. Auto Makers Plan to Boost Output
   In Third Quarter Despite Lagging Sales

   DETROIT -- Despite disappointing sales so far this spring,
U.S. auto makers plan to boost production during the third
quarter, reflecting lean inventories and concern about labor
talks this summer.
   Industry sources predict the 10 major auto makers in the
U.S. will build 1,564,216 cars in the third quarter, up 12.2%
from the relatively weak year-earlier level. All but Chrysler
Corp. and Nissan Motor Corp. expect to build more cars during
the 1990 third quarter than they did a year ago.

Qualls, an analyst with Hill &amp; Knowlton, said he expects
domestic cars to sell at a 6.7 million vehicle annual rate
during the third quarter, while the production schedules
indicate output will run at a 7.6 million car annual rate for
the quarter. That means auto makers may have to trim their
schedules by as many as 100,000 cars and trucks if sales
don't pick up, Mr. Qualls said.
   What auto makers have going in their favor is that
depressed first- and second-quarter production schedules have
helped the Big Three keep inventories down, even though sales
have been sluggish since February.
   As of May 31, Chrysler had a 56-day supply of cars,
General Motors Corp. a 62-day supply and Ford Motor Co. a
69-day supply, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a
trade journal. These levels are well within the 65-to-70 day
range considered optimal.
   Further, analysts say sales aren't the only factor
affecting production plans for this summer.
   GM and Ford may be planning to beef up output in part as a
hedge against a possible strike by the United Auto Workers
union this fall. The UAW's contracts with the Big Three
expire Sept. 14. Bargaining is expected to begin next month.
   The decision by Chrysler to cut its third-quarter car
production by 5.1%, despite relatively low inventories and
the possibility of a UAW strike, reflects the No. 3 auto
maker's sharply lower sales and the shutdown earlier this
year of a subcompact car plant in Detroit. Chrysler's sales
are off 17.5% for the year to date, and its share of the U.S.
car market has dropped to 9.7% from 10.9% a year ago.
   GM and Ford also are having sales problems. GM's sales are
down 6% so far this year, and its share of the U.S. car
market slipped to 35.5% in May from 37% a year earlier.
Ford's year-to-date sales are off 11.7%, and its share of the
passenger car market fell to 18.8% in May from 21.5% a year
ago.
   Despite soft sales, GM and Ford plan to increase
production in the July-to-September period by 13.3% and
14.5%, respectively. But GM and Ford face a potential
problem: Many dealers, worried by the weak market, are
reluctant to lay in heavy supplies of vehicles.
   "I don't want a bunch of cars I can't sell," said Glenn
Cain, general sales manager of Desmond Pontiac in Cincinnati.
Desmond currently has a relatively modest 60-day supply of
vehicles.
   Meanwhile, Japanese auto makers Honda Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. have planned sharp increases in their U.S. car
output, reflecting their market share and sales gains this
year. The Chrysler-Mitsubishi Motors Corp. joint venture,
Diamond Star Motors, and the GM-Toyota joint venture plant in
Fremont, Calif., plan healthy increases, too.
   Nissan said its third-quarter car production will fall by
18.2% because its Smyrna, Tenn., factory will be slowed to
re-tool for the launch of a redesigned 1991 Sentra subcompact
model in August.
   Here are estimated car and truck production schedules for
the third quarter:

   Moscow Confronts National Symbol
   In Its Efforts to Raise Bread Prices

   MOSCOW -- It's best not to tinker with the soul of Russia,
as the Soviet government is finding out.
   The Supreme Soviet, the Soviet parliament, overwhelmingly
rejected government plans to raise bread prices July 1,
postponing discussion of the matter until September. In doing
so, it extended a long list of genuflections to bread as a
symbol in Russian life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bread has been called the father of Russia, the soul of
Russia, the thing without which life means nothing. When a
valued guest visits a Soviet home, he is offered bread and
salt as a traditional welcome. Some schools hold special
"Bread Cult" evenings to introduce children to the history
and cultural significance of bread.
   "We teach that we were very rich, and there was beautiful
delicious bread, fresh every day," says a former Moscow
schoolteacher. "It was meant to be a description of the whole
Russian character."
   Leningrad has a Bread Museum, and every citizen well knows
that in the 900-day siege of Leningrad during World War II,
Leningraders were rationed to 100 grams of bread a day, and
the bread was made of flour and sawdust. Even the Bolsheviks
invoked bread in their rallying cry for the revolution:
"Land, bread and peace."
   As a result, the price of bread has hardly risen in the
70-plus years since then. The last price rise was in 1962. At
a Moscow bakery today, a long white loaf sells for about 20
kopeks (32 cents at the official exchange rate) and a dark
round for 10 kopeks.
   The government says it's high time to change. President
Mikhail Gorbachev complains that bread is so inexpensive
children play football with it. But when Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov last month proposed tripling bread prices as
part of his economic reform program, it caused a storm of
criticism.
   Opposition to the program within the Parliament was
particularly strong from the Central Asian regions, where
grain makes up a large proportion of the diet. And in the
breadbaskets of the Soviet Union -- the Ukraine and
Byelorussia -- local Parliaments said they would refuse to
comply with the price increase.
   But the average shopper seems to have accepted reality
over myth more quickly than the average Parliament member.
"Bread must be taken care of, but it doesn't matter if they
increase the price several times because it's way too cheap,"
said Nina, a middle-aged shopper at the largest bakery in
Moscow, where the walls are decorated with posters
proclaiming, "Bread is Precious."
   By subsidizing the bread price, the government had worked
itself into its present conundrum. Although farmers grow far
more food grain than fodder, the Soviet Union in 1989
imported 36 million tons of grain to fill about 40% of their
needs. Bread is so cheap that farmers feed it to their pigs.
   The government raised wholesale prices for grain in April
as a production incentive to try to reduce the dependence on
imports. They assumed that it would be able to offset some of
the cost by raising retail prices. Now, says Deputy Prime
Minister Leonid Abalkin, the government will have to pay out
an extra nine billion rubles this year to make up the
shortfall. A ruble is worth $1.67 at the official exchange
rate, but only a fraction of that in the black market.
   The vote to postpone discussion of bread price increases
until September may only add to public frustration. "At least
if the price goes up, maybe the quality will be better," says
Larisa Vesuchkina, as she prods loaves on a bakery shop's
shelves with the customary small metal spatula. "These days
it only lasts a day or two and we have to throw it out."

   Brady Says S&amp;L Bailout Cost Expected
   To Increase by as Much as $50 Billion

   WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, saying
that a further $30 billion to $50 billion will be needed for
the thrift bailout next year, encountered escalating
criticism from Democrats who think the Bush administration is
mishandling the cleanup.
   Mr. Brady, who recently estimated that the cost of the
bailout -- excluding interest -- probably will more than
double to over $130 billion, also said that without new cash,
the bailout effort will be out of money by the end of this
year. He didn't say how much additional funding will be
needed in the October-December quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Depressed real estate markets, higher interest rates,
thrifts' losses in the junk-bond market and a tepid response
from potential buyers of sick thrifts all have contributed to
the higher costs, Mr. Brady said. "Let's face it, and get on
with the job," he urged the committee.
   But Democrats took the occasion to draw a distinction
between how the thrift crisis developed, for which both
parties appear culpable, and the halting progress in carrying
out the massive thrift law, for which the lawmakers held the
administration responsible. Their comments were the latest
Democratic effort to capitalize on a growing problem for
President Bush.
   "There's a second S&amp;L crisis that started Aug. 9," when
the law passed, said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). "We
have heard more from the president about broccoli than we
have heard about this crisis." Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.)
said: "We are sitting on a volcano of public opinion on this
issue."
   Members admonished the administration for its original,
low cost estimates, saying that interest-rate projections
were particularly low. They also complained that the
administration should have foreseen that there would be few
buyers for thrifts under the new law's restrictions on their
activities. "I think the appearance to the American public is
that this is floundering," said Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.),
who chairs a task force on the efforts.
   Originally, the administration targeted $50 billion to
cover current S&amp;L losses. Yesterday, Mr. Brady said about
$28.3 billion will have been spent by June 30. At that point,
the administration expects 289 insolvent thrifts to have been
liquidated or sold, but their bad investments will remain in
the hands of the government. Moreover, about 800 more thrifts
are expected to require similar action.
   Mr. Brady didn't specifically ask for Congress to pass
legislation to raise the additional cash, saying this is
likely to be determined in the current budget meetings
between the administration and Congress.
   For its part, the administration used the hearing to call
again for a cut in the tax on capital gains, as a way to
bolster the real estate market. "At the margin, I think it's
the single most important thing we can do," said Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who is a member of the
Oversight Board monitoring the thrift cleanup.
   He also said that a clampdown on credit has made it
tougher to sell the repossessed real estate. "I have the
feeling that there is a strong impression among people
involved in real estate and housing that there is a crunch in
the supply of credit," said Mr. Kemp.
   Mr. Kemp also cautioned that politicizing the S&amp;L mess
could slow the progress even more. "If we turn this into an
issue of who and when and just exactly which party, I think
it's going to be a serious blow to the necessity of finding
some area of cooperation," he said.
   Both parties are pursuing S&amp;L fraud legislation more
aggressively. Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, announced he will hold a hearing
next month to examine many of the proposals to crack down on
fraud, and said he will introduce a comprehensive S&amp;L fraud
bill after the hearing. House Banking Committee Chairman
Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) and the committee's ranking
Republican, Ohio Rep. Chalmers Wylie are also introducing a
bill to speed S&amp;L-related prosecution.

   CRI Seeks to Take Offer for Four Funds
   Of Integrated Resources Inc. to Investors

   NEW YORK -- Real estate syndicate manager CRI Inc., which
has been twice rebuffed in efforts to take over the
management of four real estate partnerships managed by
Integrated Resources Inc., is seeking to take its offer
directly to the partnership investors.
   A real estate investment trust managed by Rockville,
Md.-based CRI this week filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission a proposal to offer to swap interests in
two of its real estate ventures for the Integrated
partnership interests. At the same time, CRI in two lawsuits
accused Integrated's management of trying to entrench itself
at the expense of its partnership investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The hostile proposal shapes up as a bruising legal and
financial struggle with implications for thousands of
investors in the Integrated partnerships as well as CRI's and
Integrated's managements and for bondholders facing hundreds
of millions of dollars in losses on their Integrated
investments. Integrated is operating under protection from
creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   CRI values its proposed offer at about $664 million, based
on recent prices and book values of the four Integrated
partnerships, known as American Insured Mortgage Investors,
for which funds were raised between 1984 and 1988. The funds
have about 64,000 investors.
   CRI argues that its proposed offer should be attractive to
American Insured investors because it would offer lower fees,
liquidity, more flexibility in selling the investments, and
elimination of the uncertainties connected to the Integrated
bankruptcy-law proceeding. The American Insured partnerships
aren't part of the bankruptcy-law process and continue to
operate.
   CRI has proposed to exchange shares of CRI Insured
Mortgage Association Inc., traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, or of a new company, AIM Liquidating REIT Inc., for
the units in the American Insured ventures. But the exchange
offer faces a number of hurdles, not the least of which is
the likely opposition of Integrated, which has been trying to
sell its general partnership investment in the four funds. A
purchaser of the Integrated investment would be in effect
buying a stream of income from management fees connected to
the American Insured partnerships.
   If CRI receives a majority of the American Insured
partnership interests through its exchange offer, it then
will propose to acquire all of the partnerships. CRI assumes
it would be able to replace the general partner, whose
approval of an acquisition also is required. However, CRI
warned that Integrated might try to delay any attempts to
take control.
   CRI is a real estate investment firm that manages mortgage
investment portfolios valued at more than $4 billion. CRI
Insured Mortgage is a real estate investment trust that
specializes in the market for federally insured mortgages on
multifamily housing. Its mortgage investments are valued at
$110.7 million. It also has a 67% interest in CRI Liquidating
Co., a REIT also listed on the Big Board that owns 103
mortgage investments with a value of about $356.7 million.
   According to the SEC filing, CRI was approached by
Integrated's management in September and asked if it would be
interested in buying the entities that manage the American
Insured partnerships. Integrated renewed the inquiry in
January, while it also was talking to other possible
investors.
   CRI said in early February that it offered $55 million for
the American Insured management entities and later that month
boosted the offer to $60 million. However, Integrated instead
gained bankruptcy court approval to conduct an auction for
the American Insured management business. It set a $40
million minimum bid but has subsequently said it didn't
receive any cash bids above that price that didn't include
various conditions. Integrated today is scheduled to
recommend a bid to the bankruptcy court.
   The value of the management business, however, could
change if CRI were able to proceed with its offer directly to
investors because the expected management income from the
partnerships could decline.
   Similarly, bondholders, who hold $1.8 billion in
Integrated debt, have an interest in seeing the company get
as much as possible for the American Insured management
business. The value of Integrated's assets has fallen sharply
in recent months, and debt holders may receive less than 50
cents on the dollar for their investments. The company's
investment syndication business collapsed last June when it
couldn't roll over commercial paper borrowings and faced a
severe liquidity squeeze.
   Earlier this week, Stephen D. Weinroth, chairman of
Integrated, said CRI's lawsuits and exchange offer are
"obviously trying to discourage potential buyers," but added
that he didn't know the exact terms of the offer.
   At this point, it isn't clear whether the bankruptcy court
would be asked to step in to prevent CRI's offer. Integrated
has argued that it has the right to sell the management
business without soliciting permission of the partnership
investors.
   CRI also has made its exchange offer contingent on
reversing a change Integrated made in its management contract
for the American Insured investments just a day before it
filed for bankruptcy-court protection. CRI's lawsuits, filed
in Delaware and California state courts, assert that the
contract changes "entrench" the general partners and impede
the ability of the investors to replace the manager. "The AIM
investors are entitled to a voice in the management of their
partnerships," said William B. Dockser, chairman of CRI.

   Mr. Taubes asserts that other scientists at Texas A&amp;M,
failing to reproduce Mr. Bockris's results, began to raise
questions as to whether someone could have clandestinely
added tritium to Mr. Bockris's experiments. Mr. Taubes
charges that "the Texas A&amp;M administration . . . has done
nothing past some preliminary questioning." The article
doesn't offer any specific evidence that the experiments were
tampered with and notes that no one has made fraud charges.
   John Fackler, dean of the college of science, noted that
another Texas A&amp;M scientist, nuclear chemist Kevin Wolf,
already had run experiments suggesting that Mr. Bockris's
results were spurious. In the absence of specific charges,
"We can't go any further than Kevin Wolf has done," he said.
   Mr. Fackler said he was writing Science, "pointing out
this kind of journalism isn't appropriate to a journal like
Science."

   Entrepreneur on the Run Puts Conventioneers on Air

   TV Venture Means Hectic Pace for
   Small-Firm Owner Jack Parker

   It's a classic problem for any company exhibiting at a
huge national trade show: How do you get convention delegates
to stop at your display booth?
   Jack Parker thinks balloons, free popcorn and clowns
handing out fliers are a waste of money. But then, he sells
an alternative: advertising on his closed-circuit TV station.
</LP>

   Trade shows are critical for many companies. In a few
hectic days, they must renew customer contacts, write orders
and introduce products. Mr. Parker, president of Visitors
Television Network Inc., New Orleans, tells exhibitors they
can stand out from the crowd by buying time on the programs
that VTV's small video production staff churn out. These are
shown on the trade show floor and in convention hotels.
   Mr. Parker says the enterprise makes money. Revenue this
year should be "comfortably past $750,000, and aiming for $1
million," he says. But his experience also illustrates a
reality of entrepreneurship: A successful business idea often
means a hectic life.
   The 49-year-old Mr. Parker and his staff must race to
shoot, edit and distribute a new 30-minute or 60-minute
program to hotels each day by early evening. The pace gives
his operation the aura of a low-budget, understaffed TV news
operation. "Our guiding principle is to look as much like
broadcast without costing as much as broadcast," he says.
   When conventions open, Mr. Parker says, "the days start
around 8 a.m. and never, never close until 11 at night, when
we get reports back from the hotels that the tapes are
running." Mr. Parker also gets to know his suitcases. Before
the end of February this year, he already had served the
nation's helicopter manufacturers in Atlanta, the home
builders in Dallas and the auto dealers in Las Vegas. After
he leaves the Christian booksellers in Denver next month, he
heads for the outdoor lawn, garden and power equipment makers
in Louisville.
   The pace is typical of many small entrepreneurs who must
make up with energy what they lack in size. At these
conventions, VTV's programs, reproduced on videocassettes,
can be seen running over and over on television monitors
placed about the exhibit hall. A closed-circuit tie-up with
major hotels also allows VTV advertisers to pitch their
products to delegates in their hotel rooms, where the
programs run around-the-clock on otherwise empty TV channels.
   A look at the recent American Booksellers Association
convention in Las Vegas suggests the effort it takes to turn
out the shows: Mr. Parker's headquarters is a tiny room next
to a men's lavatory, 50 feet from the convention floor. A
video crew pops in and out throughout the day, delivering
just-completed feature or commercial footage to an editor.
The editor pulls the day's program together, cutting the
videotape to the allotted time, and adding titles and music.
A salesman roams the exhibit hall, lining up future
customers. Mr. Parker bird-dogs his camera crew and chats
with advertisers, keeping in touch with his troops via
walkie-talkie.
   For one feature story, VTV reporter Charlotte Nichols
leads an on-camera tour of calligraphers, engravers,
papermakers and other bookmaking artisans. Later she plays
straight man to a rap-singing cookbook writing team, the
Clever Cleaver Brothers.
   By 7 p.m., the crew has turned out 26 copies of the day's
completed program using a shelf full of vintage video
recording machines. The copies are hand-delivered to 14
hotels and ready for watching in guestrooms by 9 p.m. The
remaining tapes are plugged into convention hall monitors for
viewing the next day.
   VTV doesn't get paid by a convention sponsor. Its sole
convention income comes from selling on-the-air ads. Not
surprisingly, the commercial content of its programs is high.
A 30-minute program at the booksellers' convention had 20
separate commercials, some as short as 10 seconds. Ad rates
vary by city and show, but at the booksellers' meeting,
several exhibitors paid $2,000 for a 30-second spot that ran
on each day's program.
   The operation is frankly commercial, and Mr. Parker says
buying advertising time on the program greatly enhances the
odds that the program will include a feature on the
exhibitor. Several features on the Las Vegas programs
revolved around projects of major VTV advertisers.
   In addition to wages and transportation expenses, most
hotels require VTV to pay an access fee to hook up to a
vacant TV channel. VTV uses an inventory of video equipment
that costs less than $100,000. The gear, packed in aluminum
trunks, is air freighted to and from the roughly 15
convention sites that VTV covers each year. With advances in
video technology, "you can provide a good TV signal and good
programming without bringing in a 60-foot production van,"
Mr. Parker says.
   Mr. Parker practiced law (he found it boring) and dabbled
in Hollywood movie production before founding the company
with a partner in 1982. Their original idea of running hotel
TV channels aimed at tourists evolved into convention
television about six years ago, when "we discovered how to
put on shows financed by the exhibitors," Mr. Parker says.
   For exhibitors, the TV ads provide a relatively
inexpensive -- if not always high-impact -- way to get
attention. Lexington Books bought VTV time at the booksellers
convention to increase awareness of the Lexington, Mass.,
publishing house, says Stephen Dragin, the publisher's
marketing director. Its 10-second VTV commercial played once
an hour for three days at a cost of $600. He says a number of
conventioneers said they saw the ad, but that response to the
publisher's offer in the ad of a 50% discount on certain
orders was "marginal."
   Passport Books, a Chicago specialist in travel and foreign
language books, spent $1,200 for two 10-second spots
featuring the author of a new book, "New York on $1,000 a Day
(Before Lunch)." "We had a line of people to meet her," says
Donald Rolfe, director of Passport's trade book division. He
notes that the constant repetition of VTV programs means that
each commercial was shown 125 times during the convention.
"We will definitely use {VTV} again," Mr. Rolfe says.

   `Peace Talkers' Jam Lines
   In Calls to the White House

   WASHINGTON -- Thousands of callers accepted Secretary of
State James Baker's invitation to call the White House when
they get "serious about peace" in the Middle East, jamming
the phone lines.
   Mr. Baker precipitated the onslaught at a House Foreign
Relations Committee hearing, when he told the new Israeli
government, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, that
Israelis must compromise if peace efforts are to succeed. Mr.
Baker said, "Everybody over there should know that the
telephone number is 1-202-456-1414. When you're serious about
peace, call us."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About 6,000 to 8,000 individuals "on all sides of the
issue," according to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater,
took Mr. Baker's invitation to heart and began calling the
White House switchboard Wednesday night and into yesterday
morning. At one point, the calls caused operators to turn to
an automatic response tape.
   Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Baker's remarks shouldn't be
construed as blaming the Israelis solely for the slow pace of
peace talks. "In the final analysis, the parties of the
region have to want peace for it to happen," he said. "And we
can't want it for them."
   The spokesman also said, "The White House operators can
expect a big Christmas present this year from the State
Department." But Mr. Baker apparently felt December would be
too late, and sent roses yesterday.

   AID FOR MOSCOW could spark a U.S.-German debate at the
economic summit.
   Though it wasn't made public, Gorbachev "in general terms"
raised the subject of Western help for his beleaguered
economy during his meeting with Bush. The U.S. now is willing
to discuss the issue in Houston. But Germany, fearing
possible Soviet economic chaos that could impede its
unification, plans to press for quick, major action, which
the U.S. will oppose.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets mostly want access to commercial credit
markets, not grants or government credits. But the U.S. says
Lithuania and emigration must first be resolved, and a better
economic plan adopted. Gorbachev would probably use new
capital for consumer goods to defuse public resentment; in
addition, he is thought to be seeking German meat and dairy
products to ease the transition to a market economy.
   One possible summit outcome: having the Group of 24
industrial countries, which is aiding Eastern Europe, study
Soviet needs and report back later.
                                                                                                       

   SUNUNU SOLIDIFIES his hold on Republican political
operations.
   Recent White House personnel moves and GOP Chairman Lee
Atwater's battle against a brain tumor increase the chief of
staff's already wide sway. With White House political
director James Wray's departure to party headquarters, his
responsibilities have been largely assumed by close Sununu
aides Edward Rogers and David Carney.
   Some Republicans grumble that Sununu is spread too thin to
devote adequate attention to political needs in the way
Atwater would. California Republicans blame lack of support
for the defeat of two GOP-sponsored initiatives designed to
prevent Democratic gerrymandering. But Republican National
Committee officials say the Californians bungled the effort.
                                                                                                       

   THE U.S. SEEKS avenues to influence Israel's new hard-line
government.
   While Baker publicly bashes Shamir, some analysts see new
Foreign Minister Levy as a possible key to improving
relations. They believe he sees his post as a stepping stone
to replace Shamir as prime minister, and thus knows he can't
preside over a big rupture in U.S.-Israel relations.
   Meanwhile, several House Foreign Affairs members privately
cheer Baker's tough remarks; some members of the unofficial
"Jewish Caucus" may visit Jerusalem soon to warn of growing
U.S. anger. A big, early test of the relationship will be
negotiations over $400 million in congressionally approved
housing loan guarantees for resettling Soviet Jews.
   The administration wants assurances the money won't be
used to put the immigrants in the occupied territories.
                                                                                                       

   MOVEMENT OF LABOR looms as a major issue in the
soon-to-be-negotiated U.S.-Mexico free-trade pact. Mexico's
Salinas sees it as a key aspect, but U.S. trade
representative Hills says it is an issue of immigration, not
trade. And allowing in more Mexican workers would surely stir
fierce opposition from U.S. organized labor.
                                                                                                       

   DOLE BRIDLES after a White House aide is quoted as saying
Bush "is not going to demagogue" the flag issue because
"that's what he's got Dole for." The Senate GOP leader shoots
back that "that's not my role," though he continues to hammer
away at the issue.
                                                                                                       

   OREGON'S BID for federal permission to launch a novel
health plan for the poor triggers debate -- and attention.
The state wants to limit Medicaid services while expanding
basic care to many people currently outside the system.
Opponents charge the plan will gut the program, but Rep.
Wyden predicts that "if it works, every governor in the
country will be interested."
                                                                                                       

   UNIONS SEE an opening in the wake of the Eastern Airlines
and Greyhound strikes for a new law next year barring
employers from permanently replacing strikers with new
workers. Teamsters chief McCarthy says his union's huge PAC
won't give money to candidates who don't support the bill.
                                                                                                       

   HOPE GROWS among Democrats for governorships and the GOP
for the Senate.
   Among big-state, currently Republican-held statehouses,
Democrats are in a strong position to retake Florida, are
even in California and are within striking distance in
Illinois and Texas; among currently Democratic states, only
Ohio veers toward the GOP. In smaller states, Republicans in
both Maine and Rhode Island are in jeopardy.
   In the Senate, analyst Charles Cook says three of the four
likeliest turnovers would be Democratic losses -- Hawaii,
Iowa and Rhode Island. Kentucky is the Democrats' best shot
at ousting a Republican, though they trail. Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake says her party's gubernatorial crop is
stronger than its Senate crop because "Democrats are still
more activist, and if you want to do something you run for
governor."
   But Republican theorist Kevin Phillips thinks his party's
Senate prospects are exaggerated, attributing it to deft "GOP
spin control."
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: New York GOP gubernatorial candidate Pierre
Rinfret, inviting a young female TV reporter to attend his
inauguration after he defeats Cuomo, adds: "Don't bring your
husband." . . . The House Ways and Means Committee is

   Vendor Expected
   To Plead Guilty
   Over Contributions

   ATLANTA -- A vendor involved in a scheme in which a
Southern Co. unit made illegal political contributions is
expected to plead guilty next week and to cooperate with a
continuing federal investigation of the affair.
   Fred Suttles Jr., president of Outdoor Media Inc., has
agreed to plead guilty in federal court here to filing a
false corporate tax return, those familiar with the matter
said. Mr. Suttles declined to comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Outdoor Media, a Pensacola, Fla., outdoor advertising
concern, was a vendor for Gulf Power Co., the Southern Co.
unit, and rented billboard space to the utility. According to
those familiar with the matter, Mr. Suttles directed his
employees to make political campaign contributions to various
candidates designated by Gulf Power and then reimbursed his
employees for the contributions. In an earlier interview, Mr.
Suttles acknowledged that the arrangement called for him to
obtain reimbursement from Gulf Power by inflating his
invoices to the utility, but he never got an opportunity to
do so. His run-in with the Internal Revenue Service stems
from his listing the reimbursements to employees as
legitimate business expenses.
   Gulf Power pleaded guilty last October to two felony
counts, conspiracy to make illegal political contributions
and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. of income taxes.
   In papers filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office last fall
laying out the basis for Gulf Power's guilty plea,
prosecutors said they were prepared to present testimony from
Mr. Suttles that "it was common knowledge among Gulf Power
Co. vendors" that they had to comply with requests for
political contributions if they wanted to get Gulf Power
contracts.
   Mr. Suttles' plea isn't expected to have any impact on
Gulf Power: Gulf Power's plea agreement, under which the
company paid a $500,000 fine, put its criminal exposure in
the matter behind it. However, the IRS's investigation of
individuals involved in the political contributions scheme
has continued and further charges are anticipated, those
familiar with the investigation said.
   A Gulf Power spokesman said the company had dismissed the
employees involved in the political contributions scheme "and
we've moved on."
   Gulf Power has said that Jacob F. Horton, a former senior
vice president, directed the political contributions scheme.
However, his family and friends assert that while Mr. Horton
was involved, too much blame has been pinned on him. Mr.
Horton was killed last April in a company plane crash, the
cause of which has yet to be determined.

   PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s new chief
executive, Paul E. Lego, announced a series of top management
changes, but he didn't signal who will emerge as his heir
apparent.
   Mr. Lego, currently president, assumes the additional
posts of chairman and chief executive officer on July 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He selected as his deputy Theodore Stern, currently
executive vice president, Energy and Utility Systems, who
becomes senior executive vice president. Mr. Stern, who was
recently named a Westinghouse director, is 60 years old, the
same age as Mr. Lego, making it unlikely that his promotion
would put him in position to succeed to the top job.
   John B. Yasinsky, already an executive vice president,
picked up most of Mr. Stern's former responsibilities --
running the turbine and generator, nuclear power systems and
waste-to-energy plant operations. Mr. Yasinsky, 51, moves to
executive vice president, Power Systems. He formerly was
responsible for the World Resources and Technology group.
   Maurice C. Sardi, 55, executive vice president,
Commercial, will become executive vice president, Commercial
and Corporate Resources. He already had line responsibility
for a number of diversified businesses ranging from office
furniture to beverage bottling. Under the new arrangement, he
assumes responsibility for real estate development,
government affairs and the research center.
   Gary M. Clark, 54, executive vice president, Industries,
will add the Westinghouse Electric Supply operation and
Offshore Manufacturing to his group. He already oversees a
hazardous waste cleanup business and refrigeration equipment
for trucks, among other businesses.
   Burton B. Staniar, 48, chairman of Westinghouse
Broadcasting Co., the company's radio and television arm,
will pick up the Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. unit and the
Westinghouse Communications business.
   Warren H. Hollinshead, 54, vice president and treasurer,
will become vice president and deputy, finance, making him
the likely successor to Harry F. Murray, executive vice
president, finance, who plans to retire at year end.

   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- In June 1988, the bookkeeper at Blan
Stewart's insurance agency here received a horrible phone
call: Mr. Stewart had been killed in a plane crash. Imagine
her surprise when Mr. Stewart walked in the door.
   And consider how she felt five months later, when she
heard that Mr. Stewart, then 45 years old, really had died in
a plane crash this time. But this was on a rainy Halloween
night. And both the wreck and the body were nowhere to be
found. No one would have blamed the bookkeeper if she'd
figured that Mr. Stewart would walk in again.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fact, Mr. Stewart does reside in the realm of the
undead. A judge recently refused to declare him dead, but no
one can say for sure that he's alive.
   Confused? So are the people of Alabama, who have been
closely following the bizarre case of Douglas Blan Stewart
Jr. It's a mystery with everything: money, power, greed --
even piqued twins.
   Everyone is taking sides. There's the wife -- or widow --
and her family, a pillar of the city's elite. Sarah Lanier
Stewart stands to gain almost $4 million in insurance if Mr.
Stewart's body really lies at the bottom of spider-shaped
Lake Martin. Then there are the insurance companies, which
don't want to pay the claims, and Donald Valeska, a state
prosecutor, who declares, "He ain't in that lake any more
than Gorbachev is."
   "He's still alive," agrees Napolean Woods, locker-room
attendant for 37 years at the Huntsville Country Club, where
Mr. Stewart was a past president and weekly golfer. In a
straw poll taken in the club's cocktail lounge, says the
bartender, "three said he was down, two said he was up."
   Ralph Kenney, who claims to have seen Mr. Stewart's plane
sputtering toward Lake Martin, figures that Mr. Stewart is
100 feet down. The butcher in Dadeville, Ala., near the lake,
points out that it's one of the largest man-made lakes in the
U.S., and still hides the remains of a bomber and its pilot
that crashed during World War II, making it an official
military grave. "That lake's probably full of stuff that
ain't never been found," he says.
   Only one thing is certain: Mr. Stewart had good reason to
disappear.
   The son of a mechanic, Mr. Stewart moved to Huntsville in
the early 1970s with his first wife and their twin boys.
Hungering for money and social status, he bounced around as
an insurance salesman, but managed to move his family into a
string of more expensive homes -- to the amazement of his own
wife, Jinna. "He aspired for things he didn't have and
couldn't afford," she says.
   Loud, chummy and fond of bourbon, Mr. Stewart back-slapped
his way into upper-crust Huntsville. His wife took the twins
and left him in the mid-1970s, but Mr. Stewart soon met Sarah
Lanier, whom he married in 1976. Mr. Stewart boasted to his
former wife that her replacement had everything: beauty,
style and money.
   Old money at that. In 1899, Mrs. Stewart's grandfather
founded what has become Huntsville's oldest and largest law
firm. Since the 1950s, her father, M.H. "Pete" Lanier, has
lorded over both the firm and Huntsville's legal community
with a reputation for toughness. The Laniers are also large
property owners, and are active in civic affairs. Pete
Lanier, everyone says, is a very powerful man.
   For a time, things went well. The couple had a daughter,
and Mr. Stewart took his wife's brother, Frederick, under his
wing in his new insurance agency.
   With their family connections and Mr. Stewart's penchant
for selling, Stewart &amp; Lanier grew into one of the largest
insurance agencies in Alabama, booking policies, at its peak,
worth more than $6 million a year in premiums. Mr. Stewart
sold more business for Travelers Corp. than any other agent
in the state.
   But he also began to buy and spend wildly: airplanes,
Jaguars, lots of travel and a condominium in Florida as well
as office, restaurant and residential property in Huntsville.
"He was living way too high for what he made," says Wade
Russell, a businessman and friend of Mr. Stewart.
   Partner Frederick was getting fed up. And finally, in
1985, after repeatedly accusing Mr. Stewart of using agency
funds on his sumptuous personal life, Mr. Lanier quit the
firm in a huff.
   Before long, Mr. Stewart allegedly turned to fraud to make
ends meet. In August 1988, the Alabama attorney general's
office charged him with stealing nearly $600,000, much of it
client premiums.
   In June 1988, Travelers hauled off Mr. Stewart's records,
essentially putting him out of business. That same day, Jayne
Patterson, the bookkeeper, received a call from Frederick
Lanier, the former partner. The two remember the conversation
differently, but both agree that the upshot was the same: Mr.
Stewart was dead.
   "My father was concerned that we could not find Blan at
any of the airports," he says. "We didn't know where the
plane was." Frederick acknowledges that the mix-up was
"unfortunate," given the actual disappearance five months
later.
   An hour or so after Frederick's call, Mr. Stewart walked
into his agency. "I was speechless," says Ms. Patterson.
   By October 1988, Mr. Stewart's buoyant mood had vanished.
Efforts to borrow money from friends were failing. And the
attorney general's office said it wouldn't accept a plea
bargain without jail time.
   Mr. Stewart asked his father-in-law, Pete Lanier, for
help. On Thursday, Oct. 27, Mr. Stewart and his wife met with
Mr. Lanier and told him of their financial troubles for the
first time, according to a deposition by Mr. Lanier. Mr.
Stewart said he needed at least $125,000. But Mr. Lanier
insisted on seeing all of his financial records before
offering any help.
   Two days later, Mr. Stewart flew to Florida for the
weekend to take care of some business and visit his sons at
college. It was the first time he had ever visited without
calling first. He seemed depressed. He slipped out Monday
morning, leaving a note telling the twins he loved them.
   His plane vanished from radar at 5:55 p.m. that night.
   Meanwhile, back in Huntsville, strange things were
happening at the insurance office. Mrs. Stewart tracked down
Ms. Patterson on Sunday -- the day before the plane
disappeared -- and asked to meet her at Mr. Stewart's office.
Mrs. Stewart asked the bookkeeper to pull Mr. Stewart's
financial records, including his personal life-insurance
policies.
   Then Mr. and Mrs. Lanier showed up and, according to a
witness, Pete Lanier sat down and took notes on a yellow
legal pad. In one interview with investigators, Ms. Patterson
recalls Mrs. Stewart telling her, "Blan's not coming home,"
and Mr. Lanier saying that he was a "gone S.O.B."
   Ms. Patterson's recollection has gotten fuzzier since
then. Asked about that, she smiles. "I have to live in this
town," she says. "Mr. Lanier is very powerful."
   Mrs. Stewart and Mr. Lanier insist that family and marital
relations were fine. The only reason the Laniers went to the
agency at all on Sunday was to pick up their granddaughter to
play miniature golf, they said in depositions.
   Mr. Lanier and Mrs. Stewart declined comment for this
story.
   Holly Wiseman, the assistant state attorney general who
had been prosecuting Mr. Stewart, tried to investigate the
apparent crash. But she ran into a buzzsaw in Pete Lanier,
whom she calls "abusive and uncooperative," so she subpoenaed
Mr. Lanier and his daughter to the Madison County grand jury
for questioning under oath.
   No charges were filed. But the state attorney general's
office says it hasn't closed the case. Investigators have
chased a number of leads, including word that Mr. Stewart's
plane is buried under several feet of cement at a central
Alabama housing development. Samples were excavated, but
yielded nothing.
   In the meantime, Mrs. Stewart, 41, asked state court Judge
Jeri Blankenship to certify that her husband is dead. Judge
Blankenship got the case after most judges in the county
bowed out because of ties to the Stewart or Lanier families.
   The request was fought by the underwriters of the life
insurance policies. In an 11-day hearing, they argued that
the only evidence that a crash had even occurred -- the
discovery in Lake Martin of an antenna, a fender and some
landing-gear parts from the missing Piper -- hardly proved
that Mr. Stewart had perished.
   The hearing was the media event of the year in Huntsville.
Banner headlines trumpeted the proceedings on front pages
across the state. The small courtroom was packed each day.
   Last month, the judge refused to rule Blan Stewart dead.
Mrs. Stewart must now wait until at least 1993 to collect any
insurance money, according to state law. She has declared
personal bankruptcy, but still lives in an elegant home.
   After the disappearance, Mrs. Stewart called Mr. Stewart's
first wife and said she loved her stepsons and hoped to
continue helping them financially, says the first wife,
Jinna. Mrs. Stewart also asked if the boys would sign a
petition to the county coroner, asking that their father be
declared dead. The boys signed the request, but the coroner
concluded that he couldn't declare a death without a body.
   Shortly after signing the petition, the twins were told by
Mrs. Stewart and her father to turn in their cars and vacate
their condominium at once, says Douglas Blan Stewart III, or
Trip, one of the sons. Mr. Stewart had given the twins money
and let them use his credit cards, but now they have been cut
off financially, Trip says, and they haven't heard from Mrs.
Stewart or the Laniers in a year.
   Trip, for one, is sure his father is still alive. And he
wonders: If the Laniers are so sure he's dead, why haven't
they held a memorial service for him?
   Mr. Lanier answered that question in his deposition for
the death petition: "My daughter asked whether we should have
one, and I said I just think that we might as well wait.

   Soviet Officials Scour Europe in Search
   Of New Loans but Find Cold Welcome

   LONDON -- The Soviets are knocking on bankers' doors in
Western Europe -- and the doors are being slammed in their
faces.
   Over the past month, the Soviet Union's stubborn economic
and balance-of-payments problems have prompted a flurry of
visits by senior Soviet financial officials to Britain, West
Germany and Switzerland. The Soviets, including officials at
Moscow's Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs, are seeking new
Western loans to roll over maturing credits and ease a
liquidity crunch that has led to delays on trade and other
payments to foreign creditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Western bankers report the Soviets have left the
meetings largely emptyhanded -- a consequence of increasing
Western uncertainty about the scale of Soviet economic
problems. Wary commercial bankers are demanding steeply
higher interest rates, charging Soviet borrowers up to a full
percentage point more than last year for identical credits.
The bankers also are attaching more strings, including
additional government guarantees, that make new credits
costlier.
   "The Russians have been around testing the market. But at
the moment there's no appetite" among Western bankers, says a
British banker who met with several officials from the Bank
for Foreign Economic Affairs this month. "The reason is
obvious: Economic and political uncertainties" are just too
great to advance substantial new funds.
   The banking situation, which could crimp Soviet plans for
a new imports program this year, highlights a critical
question facing restructuring economies across the East Bloc:
how to pay for change when Western banks won't foot the bill.
Money could become one of the most important political
bargaining tools in the debate on the future of Europe.
Rumors are circulating in financial circles here --
unconfirmed by German officials -- that Germany plans to
offer a multibillion-dollar bailout package in return for
Soviet agreement on unified German membership in NATO.
   While the Soviets have had some success in rolling over an
estimated $1 billion in short-term credits maturing each
month, the lack of fresh funds is forcing them to look
elsewhere for new financing -- a costlier, more cumbersome
and time-consuming process that threatens to worsen the
payments problem.
   Only one major new Soviet loan has been publicly announced
in the past six weeks: a $300 million credit from a Kuwait
bank. Soviet officials reportedly have been pressing Western
central banks to accept gold deposits as collateral for
short-term loans, a move paralleling similar private-market
transactions disclosed earlier this month. Separately, gold
prices have been weakening on reports of Soviet sales this
year; gold fell sharply in Europe yesterday as the Soviets
announced a $100 million gold-coin sale for October.
   Soviet officials say the current liquidity squeeze is
short-term and is due to an increase in imports last year.
Britain's Financial Times newspaper this week quoted Soviet
state bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko as saying Moscow
would resolve the late-payments problem by the third quarter
by selling $2 billion in commodities -- though not gold or
oil.
   Bill Newman, an official at Moscow Narodny Bank in London,
says that though "loans are not as readily available to the
Soviet Union as they were before," the credit-crunch is far
from permanent. He points to reported, but unconfirmed,
Soviet foreign-currency reserves of as much as $15 billion
and $30 billion in gold reserves.
   Nevertheless, the Soviets' continuing inability to resolve
the payments delays -- estimated at one stage at more than
$500 million -- is unsettling bankers and Western financial
officials. Bankers stress the situation is precarious. A
further weakening of confidence could lead Western banks to
avoid even rolling over old Soviet debt.
   "We still haven't found answers" for everything that's
going wrong in the Soviet Union, says a senior West German
monetary official. He adds that many West German commercial
contracts with the Soviet Union expire at the end of the
year. As long as the late-payments problem persists, the
Germans will let them lapse.
   The payments problem has tarnished the Soviet image in the
global credit markets. Unlike last year, when the Soviets
were able to raise more than $1.5 billion in the
international credit markets, they haven't been able to tap
the market since January.
   And they aren't expected to try again soon. "It would be a
bad time to launch an issue, given the Soviets' current
problems," says Andrew Bevan, a London-based economist at
Westdeutsche Landesbank, which led the last Soviet foray into
the global credit markets. That issue, a 500 million West
German mark bond, currently trades at 94 pfennigs per mark
face amount.
   Indeed, though only last year the Soviets could secure
attractive interest rates for short-term financing of as
little as 1/4 or 1/2 percentage point above London's
benchmark interbank rate, which currently stands at 8 3/8%
for three-month credits, bankers today would charge a full
percentage point or more for the same credit. That
effectively means the Soviets would pay 10% more for the same
money than last year.

   Market Is Lower on Earnings Worries;
   Vitalink Communications Drops Sharply

   Over-the-counter stocks reversed course and slid in
sympathy with skittish exchange-listed shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.76 to 467.10, a 0.38%
loss, as volume slipped to 155.2 million shares from 163.5
million Wednesday. Declining shares overtook advancers, 1,051
to 828.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Utility shares gave back Wednesday's gains as MCI
Communications, the largest stock in the group, tumbled 2 to
41 5/8 in affinity with exchange-listed United Telecom, down
3 1/4 to 40 7/8. Shares of the long-distance carriers fell
after analysts at PaineWebber and Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
slightly cut their 1990 second-quarter and full-year
estimates for United Telecom. The Nasdaq Utility Index fell
7.62 to 667.22.
   However, PaineWebber analyst Jack Grubman said in an
interview after the market closed that the market's reaction
to his "minor fine-tuning" of earnings estimates was
"ridiculous." Mr. Grubman explained that he lowered his
expectations slightly for United Telecom because rival
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph is stabilizing its market
share in some segments of the residential and general
business markets, although it continues to lose market share
in some other markets. Consequently, he explained, revenue
for United Telecom may be somewhat softer than expected. He
didn't change his estimates for MCI.
   The telecommunications analyst emphasized that he still
has "buy" ratings on all three long-distance carriers. Mr.
Grubman said he told institutional investors during the day
that the long-distance carrier business "is a great industry
still growing at a double digit rate." He attributed the
sharp decline in United Telecom and the fall in MCI to a
nervous stock market.
   Traders at two large New York brokerage firms said they
continue to see buyers come in when OTC stocks fall. "There
were buyers this afternoon and sellers this morning," said
Jerry Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter Reynolds.
When the market does fall, "there's an absence of real
sellers," added Ralph Costanza, who manages OTC trading at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "There are no sellers trying
to unload positions and no panics," he said.
   Vitalink Communications led the percentage losers after
the abrupt resignation yesterday of the company's chief
executive officer, chairman and president, George Archulete.
Vitalink fell 3 1/4 to 9 5/8.
   Donald J. Herman, interim chief executive for the Fremont,
Calif., maker of data communication products, said in an
interview with Dow Jones News Service that Vitalink's
earnings for the third quarter ending this month may fall
below analysts' expectations. Mr. Herman said that the
quarter's earnings may fall below a range of 21 to 28 cents a
share expected by analysts, which compares with year-earlier
profit from continuing operations of 28 cents a share.
   Analysts said the stock's slide reflects slumping product
sales. Resales of Vitalink products under an accord with
Digital Equipment Corp. are lower than in the previous
quarter because the market for the products is changing,
according to Smith Barney analyst Therese M. Murphy.
   Intel, which traded as high as 48 3/4, closed unchanged at
48 after the Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker said it
will delay for at least another year the closing of a
fabrication plant in Livermore, Calif., because of strong
demand for its 386 microprocessor. Last July the company
announced plans to close the plant this year.
   Tokos Medical added 1/4 to 15 after the Santa Ana, Calif.,
provider of health-care services said that certain principal
shareholders who own a total of 5.9 million shares of the
company's common stock have agreed not to sell any shares
before Sept. 30. Under a previous agreement related to the
company's $12-a-share initial public offering in March, those
shareholders had been allowed to sell 25% of their stock on
June 25 and an additional 25% at the end of each following
month.
   Fibronics, which rose 1 1/8 Wednesday, climbed 5/8 to 11.
Institutional investors met Tuesday in Boston with the
Hyannis, Mass., designer and maker of fiber-optic and other
high-speed data systems used in computers, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. The number of brokerage
firms following the company has doubled to four in the last
few months.
   Exabyte advanced 3/4 to 22 3/8. Steve Smith, general
counsel and investor relations contact for the Boulder,
Colo., concern, told DJPIR that Pacific Growth Equity Inc., a
San Francisco broker-dealer, issued a report on Exabyte
Wednesday and began making a market in its shares. Exabyte,
which makes high-capacity cartridge tape storage subsystems
for computers, went public last October at $10 a share.
   Mr. Smith said he is comfortable with analysts' estimates
that the company will earn about 34 cents a share in the
second quarter ending June 30, compared with 13 cents a share
on a pro forma basis in the year-earlier quarter.
   American Capital &amp; Research jumped 1 to 12 3/4 in heavy
trading after the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
said Wednesday that it awarded a $119.4 million contract to a
unit of the Fairfax, Va., environmental consulting services
concern.
   Players International tumbled 1 1/8 to 5 1/4 following a
report that U.S. Rep. Bart Gordon (D., Tenn.) plans to ask
Congress to investigate 900-number telephone games, DJPIR
reported. Players recently began test marketing its
900-number telephone version of the syndicated television
game show "Jeopardy." Wednesday, the stock fell 1 3/16 to 6
3/8 after a report of the congressman's concerns appeared in
a New York newspaper.
   Mass Microsystems extended its slide. The Sunnyvale,
Calif., maker of computer peripheral enhancement technology
said yesterday that it expects net income for the second
quarter ending June 30 to be two cents a share, down from
five cents a year earlier. Mass Microsystems, which lost 5/8
Wednesday, fell 1/2 to 4 1/2.

   Nikkei's Surprise Rebound
   Brings Back Tokyo's Bulls

   The bulls are back] In Tokyo, of all places.
   A growing herd of money managers and analysts are
predicting that the Japanese stock market, which earlier this
year looked like a meltdown, will turn into a meteor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese market has already staged a surprising
recovery. After plunging 28% from its record peak of 38915.87
on the last trading day of 1989, the Nikkei Index of 225
leading stocks that trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
bottomed out at 28002.07 on April 2. Since then, the index
has risen almost 17%, closing yesterday at 32668.11.
   That could be just a taste of what is ahead for Japanese
stocks, the bulls on Tokyo claim. Propelled by strong
economic growth, falling interest rates, lower inflation and
a stronger yen, the Nikkei Index will soar to 37000 to 40000
by year end, says Christopher Mitchinson, a managing director
and equity strategist at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London. If
the index hits 40000, the Nikkei would be up 22% from current
levels.
   The "combination of strong domestic Japanese growth, a
strong yen and low inflation will lead to a rediscovery of
the virtues of the Japanese economy," Mr. Mitchinson says.
"The feeling we had in late 1989-early 1990 of a weak yen,
rising inflation and political and administrative disarray
will give way to a renewed vision of Japan as the strong,
stable economy."
   Some analysts admit it's ironic that people are again
forecasting highs for the Tokyo stock market -- less than
three months after a major collapse of Japanese share prices
and after years of apprehension that the stocks were way
overvalued.
   Surprisingly, the traditional roles of foreign and
Japanese securities firms are reversed these days. Before the
Tokyo market plunged, foreigners were the Cassandras, always
predicting an imminent stock market collapse. By contrast,
Japanese analysts were the Pollyannas, constantly predicting
endless highs.
   No more. With many foreigners preaching recovery, Japanese
investment experts are showing uncommon prudence.
   "The Japanese market will recover its peaks eventually,"
says Shoji Yamada, Tokyo-based general manager and chief
investment officer of Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co. "But it's
not easy for the market to change to a bull sentiment after
the crash. It will take a year and half or more."
   At Nikko Securities Co., Mikio Fujino, a salesman in
Tokyo, tells his clients that he expects the market to
continue consolidating for several months before it moves
higher. "We still are cautious," he says.
   Indeed, after the Nikkei's close at 33130.80 on May 31,
the Tokyo market has mostly treaded water this month.
   Conceding that the Tokyo stock "market is impossible to
time equity investments in," Francis Finlay, chairman and
chief executive officer of Globe Finlay Inc., a New York
money management firm, nevertheless says: "The Japanese
economy is probably the best managed economy in the world."
   He warns: "You can't totally ignore one of the largest
markets in the world. You avoid Japan at your peril in the
1990s; the question is when one raises one's exposure not
whether."
   Mr. Mitchinson of Salomon Brothers thinks the time is now.
He says that a weak U.S. economy will lead to lower U.S.
interest rates, which in turn will lead to lower Japanese
rates. Lower bond yields usually increase stocks' appeal by
making them a more competitive investment.
   Mr. Mitchinson adds that Japan has "very good inflation
figures" and "has undergone the biggest peacetime investment
boom the world has ever seen." What's more, his firm sees the
dollar falling to 140 yen by year end, or by about 9%.
   Another bull, Philip Dodds, head of research at S.G.
Warburg Securities Ltd. in Tokyo, admits that the Japanese
market's valuations are approaching high levels again -- the
gap between the yield on Japanese government bonds and the
yield on stocks' earnings is a steep 4.9%. Still, he
forecasts the Nikkei will recover to nearly 37000 by year's
end.
   Akira Suzuki, a strategist at Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s
Tokyo office, says the index could climb as high as 38000
next month. So far, both he and Salomon's Mr. Mitchinson have
strong credentials. They were among the first to recommend
that clients bail out of Japanese shares in early January and
among the first to advise buying back in April.
   In addition, Mr. Finlay of Globe Finlay feels that money
managers might be getting a bit nervous about their large
European equity holdings, following the huge run-ups, some of
which began last year, in the German, Austrian, French and
Scandinavian markets.
   But more-bearish Japanese firms see plenty to worry about.
For one thing, they are concerned that a lot of stock bought
on margin, or credit, will be sold this month. Japanese
individuals were net buyers of 626 billion yen ($4.05
billion) in stock during March, just before the market hit
bottom. Much of that stock was bought with credit, and
investors are required to pay up their borrowings within
three months of buying stock on margin.
   There is also the prospect that new issues of stock, which
will resume next month for the first time since March, could
sop up cash from the market. This past year, Japanese
companies issued about 22 trillion yen ($142.63 billion) in
stock or stock-linked financings. These were so big a drain
that Japanese brokerage firms voluntarily stop underwriting
new issues in March.
   The prospect of a flood of postponed issues coming to
market is still remote, though; many Japanese companies say
they will hold off until they are sure the market can
comfortably absorb new calls for capital.
   Worries about the amount of cash in the Tokyo market is
behind the wary forecast of one foreign firm that is bearish,
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "The liquidity situation remains
poor," says Shearson analyst Pelham Smithers. Japanese
investment trusts, he notes, have been net sellers in the
market in recent days, a sign that some individuals may be
taking money out of the market.
   Money managers say the two all-important questions for
international investors in Japanese shares are timing and
deciding where to get the money from. "The sole strategic
decision from an equity viewpoint for 1990 is: When do you
increase your weight for Japan?" says Henry de Vismes, head
of international investments for Citibank's private bank.
"The person who does that {right} will be at the top of the
performance tree for 1990."
   Mr. de Vismes suggests that portfolio managers could take
profits from the U.S. stock market, where he says prospects
for growth and corporate profits are relatively poor. He says
the managers could also sell shares in European and smaller
Far Eastern markets that have already had good run-ups:
France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Malaysia and Singapore.

   Two new reports point to more tough economic times ahead
for much of the Northeast.
   Chief executive officers of midsized companies in New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut have turned more pessimistic
about the economy, with the majority expecting a recession in
1991, according to a survey sponsored by National Westminster
Bancorp., a New York-based unit of National Westminster Bank
PLC, London.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And the New England economy -- already battered by a real
estate collapse and the shrinkage of many of the region's
computer companies -- is expected to suffer from a cutback in
the defense budget over the next five years. Those cuts could
cause a 1% to 2% job loss in the region, according to a
soon-to-be-published article by Yolanda K. Henderson, an
economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
   Two-thirds of the 550 chief executives in the NatWest
survey said the national economy worsened over the past year,
while only 6% saw improvement. The proportion of them
expecting a recession in the coming year rose to 54% from 44%
a year ago.
   But the executives were more upbeat about their own
industries than about the overall economy. Nearly 60% said
they expect business to be better next year, only slightly
lower than last year's 63%. As for the current year, 49% said
business has improved from 1989 levels. The report sampled
companies in 50 industries with annual sales ranging from $5
million to $250 million.
   The discrepancy between the executives' national and local
outlooks seemed more psychological than economic, said Peter
A. Radford, NatWest's chief economist. "They feel they have
more control and more knowledge about customers and order
books, so they have more confidence about their own economy
than the national economy," he said.
   However, Mr. Radford said, views across the tri-state
region are more diverse this year than last. Officials in New
York City were the most pessimistic, while those in
Westchester County, just north of the city, were the most
optimistic in the latest survey. The readings were reflected
in a business confidence index, measuring the degree of
executive optimism in several areas including expansion,
borrowing, hiring and relocation.
   That index was highest in Westchester, with a reading of
95, down from last year's 101 but much higher than New York
City's 75. Last year, the city reading was 93. The index uses
1988 as a base level of 100. Mr. Radford said New York City
and New Jersey readings probably were depressed by news of
large state and local budget deficits.
   The survey also found that companies in the region are
operating at 78.4% of capacity, down from 81.6% a year ago. A
downward trend was also noted in expansion plans: 55% of the
officials said they expect to expand in the next two years,
down from 58% a year ago.
   The executives said major drawbacks in the tri-state area
include rising health care costs, state and local taxes,
crime, cost of office space, and drugs in the workplace. The
major benefit cited was the sizable local market for goods
and services.
   Ms. Henderson, the economist at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston, writes in an article to be published this summer
that defense contracting amounts to about 8% of the New
England economy, compared with 5.9% nationally, so defense
cuts will have a disproportionate effect.
   Moreover, she writes, defense spending will probably be
cut more sharply in New England than in other regions because
the region has a disproportionate share of procurement
revenue, and procurement is likely to be slashed more than
other areas of the defense budget such as personnel or
maintenance.
   Connecticut, where 7.5% of all goods and services produced
are for military use, is likely to be hit especially hard,
she says in the article, citing the state's aircraft and
submarine contracts in particular.
   General Dynamics Co.'s Electric Boat division makes
submarines in Connecticut, and United Technologies Corp.'s
helicopter and jet engine operations are in the state as
well.
   Massachusetts, where more of the procurement revenue comes
from missile and electronics work, probably won't be hit as
hard, she writes.
   In terms of employment, she projects that if defense
spending is cut by $4.1 billion over five years as proposed
by President Bush, the region would lose 57,000 jobs, or 0.9%
of its non-agricultural work force. Sharper cutbacks favored
by some in Congress would result in losses of as many as
134,000 jobs or 2% of the work force. Moreover, she said,
these jobs are typically relatively highly paid and held by
experienced workers who will have a difficult time finding
other suitable jobs.
   "These projected slowdowns in defense-related activities
are far from devastating, but they will feel burdensome in
the context of simultaneous weakness in the real estate,
financial services and computer industries," Ms. Henderson
writes.

   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's consumer prices in May rose 0.6%
from April and 10.2% from a year earlier, Statistics Sweden,
the national statistics agency, said, citing mainly alcohol,
tobacco and food price increases.
   Consumer prices shot up 7% in the first five months of
this year, the agency said, and 2.9 percentage points of the
increase resulted from the major tax overhaul being gradually
introduced.

   Sweden's annualized rate of inflation rose to 10.2% in May
from 10.1% in April, and was up from the 6.6% rate registered
in May last year.
   The national Price and Competition Office predicted
consumer prices will increase at a rate of 10% this year.
   Sweden's consumer price index, based on 1980 prices
equalling 100, was measured at 206.4 in May, up from 205.2 in
April.

   LIMA, Peru -- Susana Elesperu de Freitas quit her job as a
geologist hiking through the Pyrenees for a more settled life
-- selling detergent in the Andes.
   Instead of calm, she got chaos.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The day after the 34-year-old Peruvian became manager of
Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s subsidiary here in September 1988, the
economy hit the skids. By the end of the year, inflation had
soared to 2,000%. Key managers fled. Leftist terrorists
kidnapped or murdered business leaders.
   The P&amp;G subsidiary's sales plunged more than 30%, and the
unit posted a loss. Money became so tight that Mrs. Elesperu
de Freitas stopped returning long-distance phone calls, even
to her bosses at P&amp;G's Cincinnati headquarters. "I told them
they'd have to call us," she says.
   But while many multinational companies pulled out of Peru,
P&amp;G remained. And now, the consumer-products company is
expanding here. "Everybody should be dying to come here,"
says the spirited executive, who is flanked by armed
bodyguards wherever she goes. "You couldn't go to a better
business school."
   Throughout Latin America, P&amp;G is shaking the stranglehold
of government price controls and its own strict U.S. culture.
The Latin American division began as a fledgling detergent
company but now is a $1 billion business that contributes 15%
of P&amp;G's international sales. The company expects the
division, which has subsidiaries in nine countries and sells
in 10 others through distributors, to double its revenue
again in five years. And it says the division's profit
margins exceed its international average. "It's one of our
star performers," says Edwin L. Artzt, P&amp;G's chief executive.
   P&amp;G sees Latin America as central to its global strategy.
The region is rich in raw materials and in young people
hungry for all sorts of consumer products. "A lot of
companies are focusing only on Europe and Asia," says Jorge
Montoya, a P&amp;G vice president. "We're going against the
current, and it's worked."
   The company has long been a player in Latin America. P&amp;G
Mexico was one of its first foreign ventures. In Mexico, P&amp;G
learned an important lesson: U.S. management and marketing
plans often don't work outside the U.S.
   Ace detergent, launched in Mexico in the early 1950s, was
clobbered by local competitors. Developed for U.S. washing
machines, the product had a low-suds formula. But at that
time, many Mexicans washed their clothes in the river or in a
basin of water, and they judged a detergent by its suds.
   "P&amp;G assumed that what was good across the Rio Grande
should be good here as well," says Claude Salomon, general
manager for P&amp;G Mexico.
   Eventually, the formula was changed. Similarly, P&amp;G
switched from cardboard boxes to plastic bags, which kept the
detergent drier and were cheaper. Besides, many consumers
shop every day and can afford only small amounts of detergent
each time. Now, one top seller throughout Latin America is
the 100-gram bag, enough to wash just one basket of clothes.
   Despite its Mexican ties, P&amp;G long considered Latin
America a financial sinkhole. Until 1987, the Latin American
business was run from Cincinnati by U.S.-born managers who
viewed the region as far less glamorous than P&amp;G's
subsidiaries in Europe and the Far East. Mr. Artzt, while
president of the international business, pushed more managers
into the trenches, but even he didn't like to send them to
Latin America.
   However, Mr. Montoya insisted that his Latin American team
move to Caracas. "We either had to pull out {of the region}
or change our attitude," he says. Here is how P&amp;G became a
major force in two tough markets, Peru and Venezuela.
                                                                                                       

   Peru
                                                                                                       

   One word describes Peru: chaos.
   "Politically, it's a mess. Economically, it's even more of
a mess," says Patrick Egan, who heads Unilever's Latin
American operations. The Anglo-Dutch food and
consumer-products giant sold its Peruvian operations in the
early 1970s, and, Mr. Egan says, "Nothing has happened to
entice us to go back."
   So why did P&amp;G stay?
   "Exiting a country isn't something we're likely to do,"
Mr. Artzt says. P&amp;G has been thrown out of places such as
Iran, Iraq and Cuba but chose to leave only one, Chile, when
the violence escalated in 1963. P&amp;G sold its Chilean business
to Unilever, and regrets it. "We would be better off today if
we hadn't left," Mr. Artzt says. P&amp;G returned to Chile in
1983 through acquisition of a personal-care-products company
but hasn't overtaken Unilever as the dominant player.
   Opportunities multiplied in Peru only in the past decade,
since the collapse of a military regime that had forced
foreign businesses to yield control to local workers. In
recent years, a consumption boom lifted P&amp;G detergent sales
sharply.
   But inflation also soared. The economy became a house of
cards held up with subsidies, price controls and tiered
exchange rates. So, in a late-1988 program to restore order,
the government devalued the inti from 33 to the dollar to
250.
   "We were in trouble," Mrs. Elesperu de Freitas says. The
first problem was to preserve P&amp;G's business, which was
"disappearing," she adds. She cut all nonessential expenses.
Use of the copier and telephones was limited. Business
lunches and magazine subscriptions were out.
   One thing she couldn't afford to cut was the quality of
the product. Despite the lean times, P&amp;G research showed that
many Peruvians still wanted a premium brand.
   In Lima's Miraflores section, Marisabel Alzamore is doing
her daily wash. She lives in one of the adobe houses grouped
around a courtyard, where water trickles from one spigot into
a stone sink shared by more than two dozen tenants. For her
and the other women, doing the laundry is a social event, a
time to discuss children and husbands and detergents.
   Ms. Alzamore is using P&amp;G's Ace Lemon. Elbow-deep in thick
suds, she scrubs a cream-colored jacket. Ms. Alzamore, who
doesn't know that some of her visitors work for P&amp;G,
complains about the rising price of detergent, which she buys
in 225-gram bags. But she hasn't switched to an economy
brand, she says, because she likes Ace's whitening power.
Instead, she uses her wash water several times.
   "Here a family evaluates a woman by how the clothes look,"
says Patricia Foster, a P&amp;G consumer researcher. "It's a very
chauvinistic culture."
   P&amp;G, in addition to maintaining product quality, courts
the wholesale and retail trade. To keep pace with Peru's
rapid inflation, the company raises detergent prices 20% to
30% every two weeks. As a result, some small shops have
reduced their orders. To keep them supplied, P&amp;G hired a
fleet of delivery people in Volkswagen vans to deliver their
orders, sometimes for only a dozen tubes of toothpaste.
   At larger wholesalers, salesmen such as Carlos Linan spend
more time discussing pricing than pushing for higher volume.
Mr. Linan, a 20-year P&amp;G veteran, works Lima's toughest
neighborhood, La Parada. "Even the thieves know him here,"
says the sales manager, Jorge Brake.
   In La Parada, row after row of vendors offer everything
from aspirin to auto parts. Today, the price of Ace has risen
another 20%, but Modesto Limachi still buys his usual order
of 320 cases of various P&amp;G detergents -- "my best sellers,"
he says.
   One service P&amp;G no longer provides is 60-day free credit.
Now credit runs only 15 to 30 days, with its cost split
between the retailers and P&amp;G.
   Despite the turmoil in Peru, P&amp;G has widened its product
line. It now sells 15 brands of toothpaste, detergent, soap
and health-care products in the country. Crest toothpaste,
recently expanded to include Crest for Kids, ranks No. 2 in
the market, after Kolynos, an American Home Products brand
sold through a licensee.
   "Even in the middle of hyperinflation, initiatives will
make our business grow," Mrs. Elesperu de Freitas says. Her
subsidiary expects fiscal 1990 sales and profit to rise 5%
from a year earlier. And it plans to unveil new products,
which it won't describe, within a few weeks.
   The company tries hard to retain employees who might be
tempted to flee Peru. It adjusts salaries every month to keep
up with inflation and hires plenty of security guards. Mrs.
Elesperu de Freitas, the daughter of a Lima cotton broker,
says she doesn't fret about the risks of her job but now is a
bit more cautious. "Personally, I could face a country in the
midst of war and be prepared," she says calmly.
                                                                                                       

   Venezuela
                                                                                                       

   Ask Raphael Henao about the past few years in Venezuela,
and the Colombian-born, Stanford-educated manager says, in
loose translation: "When the waters are rough, the good
fishermen get the best fish. When it's quiet, anyone can
fish."
   P&amp;G hit rough waters in the early 1980s, when Venezuela
was rocked by economic shocks set off by its rising debt and
falling oil prices. The bolivar was devalued. The economy
slumped. P&amp;G's Venezuelan unit reported a loss for 1983.
   But the most vexing problem was Venezuela's strict price
controls. Despite surging raw-material costs, P&amp;G and other
manufacturers got few price increases. "Typically, we'd get
half of what we asked for, about five months later," he said.
By 1988, detergent prices in Venezuela were less than half
the U.S. levels.
   Government controls did their worst damage in late 1988.
P&amp;G suppliers couldn't deliver phosphates, which are still
used in detergents here; phosphate demand was high, and the
buyers had exhausted their import quotas under
foreign-exchange regulations. P&amp;G ads in newspapers told
customers that its plant would close until phosphate
shipments resumed.
   The ad sparked panic buying, and a local judge ordered Mr.
Henao arrested. Some people suspected P&amp;G of hoarding
inventory in hopes of raising detergent prices. Mr. Henao
fled to Colombia while P&amp;G attorneys fought the charges,
which eventually were dropped. "It was kind of nasty," Mr.
Henao says.
   At times, the government has also competed with P&amp;G. In
the late 1970s, the government itself imported Pampers
disposable diapers, one of P&amp;G's main products, and locked up
half the disposable-diaper market. The P&amp;G subsidiary also
imported Pampers and sold them to retailers and wholesalers
not supplied by the government. When the bolivar was
devalued, the subsidiary suffered because the government got
a preferential exchange rate and cheaper transportation. So
Pampers got beat by Pampers, and for a while all imports of
P&amp;G diapers were halted.
   The company didn't return to the diaper business until it
formed a joint venture with a local competitor, Industrias
Mammi, in 1988. The Mammi brand holds the biggest share in a
growing market. Even in poor countries, mothers who work
outside the home rely increasingly on disposable diapers.
   While taking care of her three grandchildren, Isabel Osuna
changes about 18 diapers a day, and the 52-year-old
grandmother rules out cloth diapers -- she says 18 are too
many to wash. So, 15 bags of Mammi diapers are stacked in the
tiny hallway of the three-bedroom apartment that she shares
with 10 relatives.
   "They may not have enough to eat, but they will have their
disposable diapers," says Eva de Mizrahi, a P&amp;G researcher.
   Studies of Venezuelan consumers indicate that they prize
value above all else. But because the country's per capita
income is only $1,370 a year, P&amp;G has introduced several new
products to help consumers stretch their budgets. One was
Moncler soap, after Venezuelans complained that a bar of soap
doesn't last long enough. Moncler's kidney shape keeps the
center of the bar from standing in water on a flat surface
and turning soft. And despite its usual avoidance of
low-priced brands, P&amp;G also has introduced an economy
detergent, Rindex, which sells for about 30% to 40% less than
the market leaders.
   Keeping track of this market's changing demands is tricky
-- and sometimes dangerous. Traveling through the interior is
tough. So is driving in Caracas; salespeople lose at least
one car a month in its demolition derby. And getting
consumers to talk requires patience. In the U.S., test
markets, mass surveys and focus groups are common, but in
Venezuela, research is done one home at a time.
   In the Barrio Zamora, P&amp;G market researchers visit Maria
Moreno as she scrubs her clothes in a yellow plastic basin.
Overhead, the afternoon sun streams through a hole in the tin
roof. The mother of three uses Las Llaves, a locally made
laundry bar, because it whitens and softens her clothes. She
also uses it to brush her teeth and scrub the concrete floors
of the three-room clay ranchito where she lives with another
family. When her son cuts himself, her doctor told her, the
laundry bar is good for cleaning the wound.
   She isn't likely to switch brands, the P&amp;G team figures.
"She thinks there's something magical about this bar," Ms.
Mizrahi comments. But there is hope for the P&amp;G people: In
the kitchen, they spot a box of Rindex, recently bought by
another tenant.

   Reebok International Ltd. said its largest shareholder,
Pentland Group PLC of London, which has a 31.5% stake, plans
to sell its holdings.
   Reebok, which has lost momentum in its a battle with Nike
Inc. for leadership in the sneaker market, said it hopes to
remain independent. Directors promptly adopted a poison-pill
shareholder rights plan to make any hostile takeover
prohibitively expensive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive officer of
Stoughton, Mass.-based Reebok, is the company's
second-largest shareholder with a 14.5% stake. Reebok has 115
million shares outstanding.
   Reebok made the announcement after the market closed
yesterday. The company hasn't been subject to much takeover
speculation in the past because of the large blocks of stock
held by insiders. However, in past years when its stock
slumped, some analysts had suggested that Mr. Fireman might
take the company private in a leveraged buy-out, with or
without Pentland.
   According to the company's proxy statement, Mr. Fireman
has a right of first refusal to buy Pentland's shares. At
current prices, purchasing Pentland's 36.2 million shares
would cost $651.6 million. Presumably such a large stake
would command a premium, however.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Reebok stock closed at $18, up 12.5 cents.
   Mr. Fireman said, "The board of directors firmly believes
that the interests of Reebok's shareholders are best served
by Reebok remaining independent. As a 14.5% shareholder of
the company, I fully support the board's position."
   He added that Reebok will support Pentland in its efforts
"to dispose of their shares to a buyer or buyers whose
interests will coincide with the long-term interests of
Reebok and its shareholders, employees, and other
constituencies."
   Reebok didn't say how Pentland would dispose of its
shares, whether in the public market or through a private
transaction. The U.S. firm declined further comment on the
announcement.
   Reebok was one of the great growth stocks of the mid-1980s
as Mr. Fireman turned a little-known British running shoe
brand into the biggest selling sneaker in the U.S. by
focusing on the aerobics market. However, in the past few
years, it slipped behind Nike, which appeals more to
athletes. Reebok has rebounded recently on the strength of
its high-priced "Pump" basketball sneakers. But some analysts
say the sneaker market is slowing to single-digit growth,
limiting Reebok's gains.
   Last year, Reebok earned $175 million, or $1.53 a share,
on sales of $1.82 billion.
   Alice Ruth, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco said she has heard in the past that Pentland was
unhappy with Reebok's performance.
   Pentland's chairman, R. Stephen Rubin, is listed as vice
chairman of Reebok, and another Pentland executive, Frank A.
Farrant, also sits on Reebok's board. However, neither is
active in daily management. Pentland is a holding company and
footwear trading firm. Mr. Rubin owns more than half of
Pentland's shares directly or through a family-owned company.
Messrs. Rubin and Farrant couldn't be reached.
   Many people have been critical of Reebok's marketing and
advertising in the past two years. The company has attempted
to sell its shoes both to the fashion market, where L.A. Gear
Inc. has been strongest, and to the performance market, where
Nike leads. Critics say this has muddied its image. Reebok
has also had problems finding a consistent ad theme, trying
and discarding the weird "U-B-U" commercials. It has
repeatedly jettisoned ad agencies.
   Mr. Fireman has taken an increasingly active role in
operations in recent months, with the departure of several
top executives who had been brought in from the outside
several years ago.
   One former employee discounted the idea of a hostile
takeover because "it would be hard to imagine anyone buying
the company without" Mr. Fireman. The ex-employee said a
leveraged buy-out by Mr. Fireman might make more sense
because Reebok has strong cash flow and little need for
capital spending because its manufacturing is subcontracted.
   Mr. Fireman is consistently one of the best-paid
executives in America because of an unusual bonus provision
under which he receives 5% of the amount by which Reebok's
pretax earnings exceed $20 million. Last year his
compensation totaled $14.6 million.
   Reebok said that under its shareholder rights plan,
holders of record on June 29 will receive rights to purchase
one Reebok common share at $60 for each share held.

   British Steel PLC, seeking to reduce its dependence on the
glutted U.K. market, is eager to buy a North American
steelmaker.
   British Steel, which was privatized in late 1988, said it
has up to #500 million ($855.9 million) in cash and is
willing to leverage 30% of its #4 billion equity for future
acquisitions. That would translate roughly into about #2
billion to spend on expansion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company declined to specify targets, but didn't rule
out any steelmaking candidate. "Our radar is operating on
all" steel manufacturers, said Chairman Sir Robert Scholey.
   Analysts say the company is interested in strong
management and value-added products, such as coated and
painted sheets of steel, used for construction and
automobiles. They believe the most likely targets are
integrated steelmakers wanting to spin off certain plants, as
opposed to smaller minimills, most of which concentrate on
less-profitable bar, wire and rod products.
   One obvious possibility: USX Corp.'s steel operations,
which investor Carl Icahn unsuccessfully urged the company to
spin off. In the early 1980s, British Steel had discussed a
joint venture at USX's Fairless Hills, Pa., plant, but that
proposal fell through.
   Sir Robert said that while he watched the recent proxy
fight at USX with interest, "we're not interested in Mr.
Icahn's stock." And USX's entire steel operations would most
likely be too large to swallow, he said.
   Still, USX expects to spin off some of its steel
operations or form joint ventures with other companies. "A
lot of companies are looking at that possibility," said
Christopher Plummer, an analyst with WEFA Group. He also
noted that the only major steelmaker without a foreign
partner is Bethlehem Steel Corp., which recently said it
wouldn't rule out a joint venture.
   British Steel, which currently is consolidating its U.K.
operations, initially targeted neighboring Europe for growth.
It has discussed buying operations in both Spain and West
Germany. However, negotiations have been slow and
frustrating, partly because of government constraints, and
British Steel has yet to complete a deal.
   Now, Sir Robert said the company wants to wait "while the
climate stabilizes" in Europe, and has turned attention to
North America, where free enterprise offers a better cultural
fit.
   British Steel, widely regarded as one of the world's most
profitable and efficient steelmakers, believes it can make
North American steelmakers more cost efficient. Moreover, the
company, which outspends North American steelmakers in
research and development, could also provide advanced
technology and help to develop the fledgling export market.
   Its desire for a North American steelmaker with a strong
management team indicates the company wouldn't be interested
in a hostile bid.
   WEFA Group's Mr. Plummer says he knows of several other
cash-flush European steelmakers eyeing North America. The
problem, he said, is that the Japanese have already snagged
the more profitable operations through joint ventures,
especially in the coated sheet operations -- a British Steel
mainstay. Likewise, most major Canadian steelmakers have
Japanese partners.
   But British Steel produces a wider variety of products
than most U.S. steelmakers, Mr. Plummer noted, which makes
finding a complementary product fit easier. One area of
strength, he said, is the sections market, which produces
steel to make machinery and equipment.
   Charles Bradford, an independent steel analyst, believes
there is too much capacity in the U.S. structural market,
also a British Steel stronghold. The problem will increase
when two minimills come on line within a year to produce
structural steel. Brian Moffat, British Steel's managing
director, finance, said the company can expand the structural
market by improved and aggressive marketing to the
construction trade.
   The big obstacles to a North American acquisition are
environment, health, pension issues and current labor
contracts. At British Steel, blue collar workers aren't paid
a flat hourly rate, and 37% of their compensation is tied to
incentives and company performance, Mr. Moffat said. Such
terms might be tough to sell to the United Steelworkers of
America.
   Health and pension costs are more fully funded in Canada,
which may make steelmakers there more attractive. British
Steel said it wasn't interested in buying a Mexican
steelmaker.

   CPC Will Curb
   Claims in Its Ads
   For Mazola Lines

   CPC International Inc. signed a consent agreement with the
Federal Trade Commission under which the company agreed not
to run allegedly misleading advertisements that imply its
Mazola corn-oil products can lower cholesterol.
   The FTC charged CPC with "making false, misleading and
unsubstantiated advertising claims" about the effect of
Mazola products on serum cholesterol levels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In signing the agreement -- and similar agreements with
the attorneys general of 10 states -- CPC, based in Englewood
Cliffs, N.J., didn't admit it violated any law. But it agreed
not to make certain statements in future ads, and it agreed
to pay a total of $100,000 in legal costs to the states.
   The FTC's complaint cited, among others, a print ad
showing a fried chicken leg with the headline "Add Mazola,
reduce cholesterol." The text of the ad went on to say, among
other things: "Not only are Mazola products cholesterol-free,
but Mazola corn oil and margarine also help reduce your
existing serum cholesterol level. Yes, reduce your
cholesterol."
   The FTC charged that, without other dietary changes, CPC
"does not have a reasonable basis for that claim."
   Bob Gillespie, president of CPC's Best Foods unit, said
yesterday that "in hindsight, that wasn't a good ad for us to
run." He said that ad and the others in question have since
been pulled. Current TV ads for Mazola, Mr. Gillespie said,
pitch that Mazola "as part of a prudent balanced diet and
exercise program can in fact contribute to lowering
cholesterol."
   "We've got a good, solid defensive case supported by
clinical research" that Mazola can help lower cholesterol as
part of a balanced diet, Mr. Gillespie said.
   The crackdown on CPC follows by just a couple of months a
similar offensive directed by the same group of attorneys
general against RJR Nabisco's Nabisco Brands unit, which
agreed to stop running ads for its Fleischmann's corn-oil
margarine and other products. Like CPC, Nabisco didn't admit
any wrongdoing, but pledged not to run the contested ads.
   "I hope the business sector understands that we're in this
for the long haul," said Hubert H. Humphrey III, the attorney
general of Minnesota, one of the states in the agreement.
"This ought to send a very strong message that misleading and
false advertising will not be tolerated."

   Forecast Is Bearish for 1990 Ad Spending

   An advertising forecaster, citing the sluggish economy and
a "disastrous" retail market in cities across the nation,
sliced his ad spending outlook for 1990.
   Robert Coen, director of forecasting for Interpublic
Group's McCann-Erickson unit, said total U.S. ad spending
would climb 5.3% this year, not the 6.2% he forecast in
December. He lowered both his national and local advertising
forecasts but said the biggest disappointment was in local
advertising. A major problem, he told a meeting of securities
analysts, is the "disastrous retail situation in many local
markets, and a very tough short-term situation . . . in
newspaper classified."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Coen also made his preliminary forecast for 1991,
predicting total U.S. spending would climb 7.5% to $140
billion.
   Analysts were split on whether Mr. Coen's forecast is on
the mark, with several saying it still may be too optimistic.
James Dougherty, an analyst with County NatWest Securities,
noted that first-quarter ad spending figures were so weak
that budgets would have to spurt in the second half to meet
Mr. Coen's forecast.
   "I'm not convinced" that spending will increase that much
in the second half, Mr. Dougherty said. If spending continues
at its first-quarter rate, he calculates, total 1990 growth
would be about 3.5%.
   Even at Interpublic, there is some question as to whether
major advertisers will up their spending in the second half.
At the analysts meeting, Eugene Beard, Interpublic's
executive vice president, noted that the agency group's U.S.
consumer goods clients "are delaying their spending, or
spending is erratic." In an interview, he said: "I think we
will see improvement in the second half vs. the first half,
but how much I don't think anybody can say. I wouldn't dare
hazard a guess." He added that overseas spending is holding
up "fine" and that Interpublic won't need to adjust its
earnings forecast.
   Mr. Coen, though, said he was encouraged because major
advertisers appear to be spending at a faster rate than
average. "The top brands are out there like gangbusters;
there's no advertising recession among key advertising
brands," he said. Among major advertisers, food ad spending
was up 15% in the first quarter, while drug advertising was
up 18%. But other important advertisers cut spending,
including automobiles, where spending was off 2%, and two
smaller categories: cigarettes, off 26%, and computers, down
33%.
   Mr. Coen said he shaved his national ad spending estimate
-- to 5.7% from 6.3% -- partly because of weakness in
magazines and direct mail. In the first four months of this
year, magazine ad pages fell while revenue increased
slightly, reflecting lagging cigarette and car advertising.
Direct mail volume, which Mr. Coen initially expected would
see a healthy increase, has been flat so far because of
continuing fallout from a 1988 postal increase. National ad
spending should total $72.9 billion, he said.
   Local advertising is faring far worse. Mr. Coen slashed
his local spending estimate to 4.7% from 6.1% in the face of
a miserable retail market affecting both local newspaper and
TV advertising. Both were hurt by pockets of recession in
some parts of the country; classified advertising in
particular is hypersensitive to the economy. The bankruptcy
filings and financial problems of major retailers are also
factors.
   Local TV advertisers have cut back substantially in some
cases. Automobile dealers slashed their local TV spending 21%
in the first quarter, while department store advertising was
off 13%. Spending of troubled banks and savings and loan
associations was off 14%. Local spending will total $130
billion, Mr. Coen estimated.
   "It's just a desperate retail market in many parts of the
U.S.," he said. "There's no sign that there's a real big
gathering boom at the local level. The real question is
whether we've hit bottom."
   Mr. Coen estimated overseas ad spending would grow 8% in
local currencies and 5% when translated into dollars. He said
spending weakness in several countries, including the U.K.
and Australia, "is likely to turn back upward again within
the next 18 months."
   Despite Mr. Coen's downward revisions in U.S. spending,
some analysts held out hope that 1990 may yet recover,
perhaps winding up even better than Mr. Coen suggested. The
upfront market, during which major advertisers buy network TV
time for the fall season, is about to kick off now. If
upfront sales are strong, "that will set the tone for the
entire year," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with
PaineWebber. And considering the strong growth among major
advertisers pinpointed by Mr. Coen, he added, the forecast
"may come back to where {Mr. Coen} started from."

   TOBACCO ADS: As expected, Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.)
introduced a bill in Congress to restrict tobacco advertising
in the U.S. Under the bill, tobacco ads could include only a
picture of a single pack of cigarettes with text against a
white background. People could not appear in the ads. Rep.
Waxman said the legislation was designed "to stop tobacco
sales to youth and force tobacco companies to tell the truth
about the health effects of their products."

   Manitoba Indian
   Threatens Passage
   Of Canadian Plan

   OTTAWA -- A Manitoba Indian leader, Elijah Harper, is
threatening to block Manitoba ratification of a plan to
settle Canada's constitutional impasse.
   The proposed accord, which deals mainly with the
constitutional concerns of Quebec, will lapse if it isn't
ratified by all provincial legislatures by June 23, a legal
deadline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Harper, by filibustering, has already seriously
delayed the Manitoba Legislature's consideration of the
proposed ratification bill. The Manitoba government warned
that its legislature would have difficulty passing the
ratification bill by June 23 even with the cooperation of all
its 57 members, because of Manitoba's requirements for public
hearings on legislation.
   Mr. Harper, who represents a northern Manitoba
constituency, is opposed to the constitutional plan because
he believes it doesn't adequately address the concerns of
Canadian Indians and other native groups.
   Political polls in Quebec show strong support for
separation from the rest of Canada if the proposed agreement,
known as the Meech Lake Accord, isn't ratified. The
agreement, negotiated three years ago at Meech Lake, Quebec,
would recognize the largely French-speaking province as a
"distinct society" within Canada. The designation would be
used by the courts in interpreting the constitution.
   Native groups assert that they have as much claim as
Quebec to special status in the constitution. They also
object to the veto powers that the Meech Lake Accord would
grant Quebec and other provinces over future constitutional
changes, possibly affecting native rights.
   Mr. Harper delayed the Manitoba government's introduction
of the ratification bill by refusing to give his consent to a
motion that would have permitted the legislature to forgo the
usual 48 hours of notice for a new bill.
   The 48-hour notice period ended yesterday but Mr. Harper
further delayed proceedings by raising points of order and
putting 17 questions to Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon and
members of his cabinet. Mr. Harper has broad support for his
actions in Manitoba. A recent poll showed that 51% of
Manitobans thought the Meech Lake Accord should be scrapped.
   The constitutional plan also faces uncertain ratification
prospects in Newfoundland, where the legislature is scheduled
to vote late next week. Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said
he doesn't like the agreement but has urged legislators to
make up their own minds. Another holdout province, New
Brunswick, is expected to ratify the accord today. The other
seven provinces have already ratified it.
   The leaders of all parties in the Manitoba Legislature
have recommended approval of the proposed constitutional
amendments. Mr. Harper, a member of the New Democratic Party,
has broken ranks with the party's leadership.

   GOOD NEWS FOR EAST GERMANY

   The European Community Commission proposed to abolish all
trade restrictions between East Germany and the EC as soon as
possible ahead of formal German unification.
   East German officials welcomed the plan for a "de facto
customs union," which would allow for free, two-way trade in
both industrial and agricultural goods. Both EC and West
German officials said that EC companies must rapidly gain
access to the East German market if they are to participate
in the country's economic reconstruction.
   "It will help the establishment of a market economy" in
East Germany, said Dieter Funke, trade counselor at East
Germany's Brussels embassy. Christiane Scrivener, the customs
commissioner, said the plan "is one of the first concrete
signs of the community's commitment to the German unification
process."
   The plan needs the approval of EC ministers, which
officials said is expected in the next few weeks.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIA-VIETNAM AGREEMENT
                                                                                                       

   Australia signed an agreement with Vietnam to expand
investment and trade between the two nations. Australian
Industry, Technology and Commerce Minister John Button signed
the agreement after talks in Hanoi with Vietnamese Commerce
Minister Hoang Minh Thang. Mr. Button said two-way trade
between Australia and Vietnam had grown from 6.1 million
Australian dollars (US$4.7 million) in 1984 to A$99.6 million
last year. He said the agreement covered such areas as
infrastructure development, science, technology, transport,
tourism, banking, environment and education.

   A delegation from Automobiles Peugeot S.A., the main unit
of France's Peugeot S.A., is in Brazil to discuss the
company's possible entry into the South American country, a
Peugeot spokesman said. He said the delegation is meeting
with Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello and other
officials "to talk about the rate of penetration into the
market, the mode of payments to the parent company, what will
be the {Brazilian} government's role, among other issues."

   South Korea authorized the creation of a private
television station in an attempt to create competition in the
country's monopolized broadcast industry. Information
Minister Choe Byung Yul said restrictions on broadcast
frequencies would be lifted for the first time in 10 years to
set up a privately managed network and to secure fair and
autonomous broadcasting. He called the nation's current
broadcasting structure the product of an earlier military
government.

   Frankfurt is Western Europe's most prosperous city,
followed by Brussels, Venice, Munich and Amsterdam, according
to a report by Prof. Paul Cheshire at Britain's University of
Reading. The study took into account gross domestic product,
unemployment and other factors and covered only European
Community cities with a minimum population of 300,000. The
professor said he didn't include Portugal and Greece because
they couldn't provide adequate figures. The three poorest
cities in the survey were all in Spain: Malaga, Cordoba and
Seville.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA FIGHTS RISING CRIME
                                                                                                       

   China exhorted its 1.1 billion people to inform on
criminals and announced a crackdown to combat rising crime.
The People's Daily newspaper quoted China's chief justice as
saying a "serious smashing" struggle had to be launched to
maintain social stability. The newspaper said there had been
126,900 crime cases in the first four months of this year --
a big increase over the same period last year. It did not
give last year's figures.
                                                                                                       

   A BLOW FOR AIR CANADA
                                                                                                       

   Britain's Court of Appeal upheld the right of customs
officers to seize airliners found to be carrying drugs, even
if the drugs are aboard without the airline's knowledge.
   The court overturned an earlier ruling that customs
officers at London's Heathrow Airport acted unlawfully when
they impounded in 1987 an Air Canada plane after they found
730 pounds of cannabis in its cargo. The plane took off
before the drugs were found in the cargo it left behind but
was seized on its return a few days later. The airline had to
pay $85,000 in fines to recover the aircraft.
   An Air Canada lawyer said the new ruling meant an airliner
on a scheduled flight could be seized if one passenger had a
cannabis cigarette. He said Air Canada would likely appeal
the judgment to the House of Lords.
   "This judgment is important because it imposes an
impossible responsibility on an airline," the lawyer
concluded.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Hanover, West Germany, was chosen to be the site of the
Expo 2000 world fair. Hanover was selected by the Paris-based
International Bureau of Expositions in a 21-20 vote over
Toronto, the only other candidate after Italy this week
dropped a campaign on behalf of Venice. . . . A strike by
French air-traffic controllers disrupted the nation's air
transport yesterday, causing delays of between one and two
hours for international and domestic flights. The strike,
called to demand better pay and more staff, is due to end at
midnight tonight.

   WASHINGTON -- Producer prices rose 0.3% in May, reversing
a three-month period of decline but suggesting inflation is
likely to continue at a moderate pace.
   The Labor Department said the May increase followed drops
of 0.3% in April, 0.2% in March and 0.1% in February. Much of
May's rise was due to a 0.6% jump in consumer food prices
following declines of the same magnitude in both April and
March.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some analysts had speculated earlier this year that the
Federal Reserve might be compelled to boost interest rates to
curb inflation. But even with the May rise, economists
generally believe price rises currently are mild and that
restrictive action by the Fed is unwarranted.
   "The Fed shouldn't react specifically to this report; that
is, we don't expect them to raise interest rates," said
Mickey Levy, chief economist for First Fidelity Bancorp in
Philadelphia.
   Ron Schreibman, an economist for the National Association
of Wholesale Distributors, said, "The trend in inflation is
clearly downward." He noted that producer prices rose 4.9%
for all of 1989, while they climbed at annual rate of just 4%
from January through May of this year.
   But Donald Ratajczak, an economist for the Economic
Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta,
asserted, "There is still a modest underlying degree of
inflation lingering around." He predicted that the Fed would
"just sit and wait for more information, just as they have
been doing for the past few months."
   Some economists cautioned that it's difficult to predict
the course of inflation based on the latest price report.
"The finished goods index is up after three months of
decline. The overall 12-month index is about half of what it
was in January. And core producer inflation was the same as
in April and nearly what it has been since October," said
Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. "The only thing that is clear from
today's report is that trying to predict inflation from
short-term producer price movements is all but impossible."
   Energy prices last month continued their decline following
a sharp rise in January, when a bitter cold wave chilled much
of the nation. They fell 1% last month after dropping 1.7% in
April, 2.4% in March and 4.9% in February.
   Excluding food and energy prices -- an approach many
economists believe better indicates price pressures in the
economy because those categories are highly volatile -- the
department's producer price index for finished goods rose
0.2% in May.
   The producer price index measures the prices factories and
other producers receive for their goods. It doesn't include
prices for services.
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported that business
inventories inched up 0.1% in April, while sales plunged
1.1%.
   The combination meant it would have taken 1.49 months to
sell off the stock of manufacturers, retailers and merchant
wholesalers at April's sales pace, slightly higher than
March's 1.47 inventory-to-sales ratio.
   Despite the rise, the ratio remained at a level that
indicates businesses are still managing inventories
successfully. If businesses misjudge sales, inventories may
pile up to the point that managers are forced to cut back on
production, orders and labor. Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan has credited careful control of inventories as
one of the main reasons why the country has avoided a
recession for nearly eight years.
   According to the report, business sales totaled $533.04
billion in April, while inventories stood at $794.46 billion.
   The numbers were adjusted for seasonal variations.

   Mulheren Admits That He Agreed to Pay
   $790,000 He Didn't Owe to Boesky Firm

   NEW YORK -- John A. Mulheren Jr. admitted that he agreed
to pay Ivan F. Boesky's company $790,000 even though he had
no legal obligation to make the payments, but contended it
wasn't part of any illicit arrangement.
   Ending two days of testimony in his own defense, Mr.
Mulheren said he agreed to pay Mr. Boesky the money by
inflating brokerage bills that Mr. Mulheren's former company,
Jamie Securities Co., paid to Mr. Boesky's trading company in
late 1985. Mr. Mulheren said he agreed to give Mr. Boesky's
company, Seemala Corp., the money "only because they beat me
up and harassed me over the telephone." He was referring to
Mr. Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator, and
Michael Davidoff, a key aide to Mr. Boesky.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,
securities and mail fraud and keeping false records. The
government has alleged that Mr. Mulheren conducted numerous
illegal securities trades with Mr. Boesky's company, and that
Mr. Mulheren proposed a bogus scheme to compensate Mr. Boesky
for profits on those trades. The scheme allegedly called for
inflating Jamie's brokerage fees to Mr. Boesky's trading
company in late 1985.
   But Mr. Mulheren said he agreed to pay Mr. Boesky's firm
the money because Mr. Boesky had often done him "favors." He
said, "I increased the bills" to Seemala "to get them back a
favor," because Mr. Boesky had sold him stocks that made Mr.
Mulheren's firm a lot of money. Mr. Mulheren, who ran a
limited partnership, said he didn't tell any of his investors
that he was paying the $790,000 to Mr. Boesky. Mr. Mulheren
said he often inflated brokerage bills paid to others who had
also done him favors. "I've been marking up bills for years,"
he said.
   Clad in blue jeans and a turquoise sport shirt, Mr.
Mulheren was often smug and surly when responding to
questions put to him by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alfred
Pavlis, a prosecutor in the case. "You're a very wealthy man,
aren't you, Mulheren?" Mr. Pavlis asked. "No, the lawyers are
now," Mr. Mulheren quipped.
   "Isn't it true that you invited Ivan Boesky to your
wedding anniversary" in the late 1970s? Mr. Pavlis asked.
"Which one, there was one every year," Mr. Mulheren
responded.
   Mr. Boesky's cooperation with the government led to a
sweeping insider-trading investigation and to the
government's case against the 40-year-old Mr. Mulheren. In
earlier testimony, Mr. Mulheren had tried to distance himself
from Mr. Boesky, painting Mr. Boesky as only a casual
acquaintance.
   But yesterday, under cross-examination, Mr. Mulheren
acknowledged that he twice told the Securities and Exchange
Commission under oath that he spoke to Mr. Boesky "twenty
times a day, every day of the year." Mr. Mulheren called his
prior testimony "a gross exaggeration," but added, "It's not
a lie."
   Mr. Mulheren said Mr. Boesky had shared "sensitive and
confidential" information with him. He also acknowledged that
he had once hosted a charity dinner on Mr. Boesky's behalf,
and that Mr. Boesky had given a donation to Mr. Mulheren's
alma mater, Roanoke College, in Mr. Mulheren's name.
   Three government witnesses, including Mr. Boesky, have
previously testified that Mr. Mulheren conducted a series of
trades that were designed to generate tax losses for Mr.
Boesky's trading firm and to help Mr. Boesky evade net
capital requirements. But under intense questioning by Mr.
Pavlis, Mr. Mulheren insisted he never did anything illegal
and never understood that profits and losses from the trades
were to be borne by Mr. Boesky's company, as the witnesses
had said.

   NEW YORK -- Stock investors shifted their attention from
the hope for lower interest rates, which would spur the
economy, and bid prices lower amid a gathering gloom about
earnings.
   For the second day in a row, rising bond prices failed to
lead stocks higher. Part of the reason was news of
lower-than-expected profits at Digital Equipment and United
Telecommunications.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 1.48 points to
close at 2928.22 in light trading. Broader market indexes
fell by wider margins. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, for
example, declined 2 to 362.90.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose nearly half a
point, or almost $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. In quiet
currency trading, the dollar rose against the mark and fell
against the yen, which was buoyed by higher Tokyo stock
prices.
   Bond prices rose in overnight trading on news of another
big drop in gold that was caused, some said, by Arab selling.
Bonds eased after the U.S. producer price index, a measure of
wholesale inflation, came in close to expectations. But they
rose again in response to a broad decline of commodities
prices, which was seen as good news for inflation. Trading
was moderate.
   But stock investors weren't paying attention, and instead
nursed their bottom-line blues. Adding to the list of bad
news about earnings were indications that problem loans will
continue to hurt the profits of banks, whose shares fell as a
result.
   Banks also play a role in a larger -- and gloomier --
scenario outlined by Robert Stovall, president of money
manager Stovall/Twenty First Advisers. He says banks are
getting skittish about lending money as regulators grow
increasingly vigilant. Tough-to-get loans eventually will
affect earnings, which will begin to disappoint stock
investors.
   "There is credit rationing on the part of wounded, gun-shy
banks," Mr. Stovall said. "It will inhibit profit growth."
   The more immediate concern, said Carmine Grigoli, vice
president, equity research, at First Boston, is the specific
reports of declining earnings expectations. The disappointing
retail sales figures reported this week suggest "the economy
is alarmingly weak," he said, which will hurt profits more
than any credit crunch.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices eased in light trading, with 135.8 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Decliners led advancers, 917 to 560.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.34%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was up against most other major currencies. In
late New York trading, the currency was quoted at 1.6935
marks and 154.17 yen, compared with 1.6865 marks and 154.75
yen Wednesday.

   Technology &amp; Health:
   Many Students Remain at Risk of AIDS
   Despite Education Efforts, Study Finds
   ----

   Despite increased efforts to educate children about AIDS,
many high-school students across the country still run a
significant risk of infection, according to a new report by
the Centers for Disease Control.
   The study, a compilation of reports from departments of
education in 30 states and 10 cities, found that many
high-school students use intravenous drugs and share needles.
Many students also say they have multiple sexual partners.
Both behaviors can result in transmission of the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The findings, says Laura Kann in the CDC's division of
adolescent and school health, are particularly significant
because they show that the threat of infection among students
isn't limited to schools in cities with large AIDS
populations.
   "We're not talking about students just in San Francisco or
New York City," Ms. Kann said. "It's across the nation."
   Surprisingly, the study showed that most students are
aware that high-risk behaviors can lead to infection. Between
93% and 100% of respondents in various districts, for
instance, said they knew that AIDS or HIV infection can be
transmitted by sharing needles used to inject drugs.
Similarly, between 74% and 98% of respondents said they were
aware of the potential dangers of having sexual intercourse
without using a condom.
   The problem, Ms. Kann said, is that knowledge about the
behavior "isn't sufficient to keep kids from practicing those
behaviors. We also need education programs that help kids
assert themselves in situations" that could lead to
transmission of the virus.
   Thirty states, as well as the District of Columbia, now
require AIDS education for elementary or secondary schools,
according to the National Association of State Boards of
Education in Alexandria, Va. The requirements -- and
effectiveness -- of each program, however, vary widely from
state to state.
   Sixteen states, for instance, require AIDS education to
begin sometime between kindergarten and the fifth grade, said
Katherine Fraser, program director of the association's AIDS
Education Project. But some states don't mandate any specific
grade level in which to begin instruction. Moreover, the
instruction itself may be something as broad as a single
assembly, Ms. Fraser said, or something as detailed as a
series of classes over an entire semester.
   The CDC study points out, for instance, that significant
numbers of students still believe, incorrectly, that AIDS may
be transmitted by blood donations or through insect bites or
the use of public toilets.
   "There's still a lack of understanding about how serious
this is," Ms. Fraser said. Echoing the CDC, she adds that
school districts in small towns sometimes tend to regard AIDS
as a problem limited to bigger cities, an attitude that
results in a "major barrier" to improved educational efforts.

   Sale of Hercules
   Unit to Japanese

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is investigating
whether to block the sale of a Hercules Inc.
semiconductor-equipment subsidiary to Nippon Sanso KK of
Japan because of concerns the sale will harm national
security and violate antitrust laws.
   The sale of the subsidiary, Semi-Gas Systems Inc., has
sparked controversy in the government and electronics
industry because Semi-Gas is an important supplier for
Sematech, the government-industry consortium formed to help
U.S. semiconductor makers catch up with the Japanese.
Semi-Gas is well-versed in Sematech's proprietary technology
and its plans, the consortium maintains, and could leak this
information to its prospective Japanese parent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The sale will leave us at the mercy of monopolistic
control from Japan," said Rep. Doug Walgren, (D., Pa.), who
chairs a House panel on competitiveness that has looked at
the acquisition.
   Hercules, a Wilmington, Del., chemical and propulsion
company, sharply disagrees. Patrick Womersley, Hercules's
acquisition and divestiture manager, said the sale actually
could help the U.S. semiconductor industry by introducing
Japanese technology into this country.
   Two administration agencies are investigating the proposed
sale. Several weeks ago, an interagency group called the
Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, which
reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national
security grounds, started an investigation of Semi-Gas,
according to administration and congressional officials. Of
the approximately 330 transactions the interagency group has
reviewed on a preliminary basis, only 10 have resulted in
such an investigation.
   The interagency group recommends to the president whether
to block a foreign acquisition. But the group interprets
national security narrowly; so far, President Bush has moved
to block only one acquisition: that of a small aircraft parts
producer by a Chinese firm.
   "The linkage to Sematech gives us concerns," said an
administration official involved with the investigation.
"That's an organization put together to help the Defense
Department reduce dependency on foreign suppliers of
semiconductors." The Pentagon contributes $100 million a year
to Sematech, a sum matched by the Austin, Texas, consortium's
14 members. Sematech's goal is to develop semiconductor
manufacturing technology superior to Japan's.
   The proposed acquisition could face a tougher challenge
from U.S. antitrust enforcers. On June 1, the Justice
Department's antitrust division sent Hercules a "second
request for information" consisting of 23 pages of questions
and requests for documents detailing Semi-Gas's sales in the
U.S. and abroad. The request signals that the department is
seriously investigating the transaction; such attention
sometimes causes companies to restructure or even drop deals
to head off formal legal action by the government.
   Semi-Gas is a small San Jose, Calif., company which
produces equipment that routes gases used in semiconductor
manufacturing. These gases are highly toxic and must be
maintained at very high levels of purity. Nippon Sanso, a
Japanese maker of semiconductor gases, agreed in April to buy
the Hercules subsidiary for about $23 million. Semi-Gas has
annual sales of $20 million and controls one-third to
one-half the small U.S. market for this equipment.
   Sematech considers Semi-Gas equipment state-of-the-art.
But Mark FitzGerald, an analyst for the market research firm
Dataquest Co., said that other U.S. firms make equipment that
is equally good. "Nippon Sanso isn't getting a technology
jewel" in Semi-Gas, he said.
   Indeed, Mr. Womersley, the Hercules manager, said his
company owns Semi-Gas's most advanced technology, its
gas-purification technology, and doesn't intend to sell it.
He offered to meet with Sematech officials to assure that
confidential Sematech information won't be divulged to the
Japanese. But Sematech said it remains "very skeptical" that
the protection will work.
   In San Jose, many of Semi-Gas's 120 employees oppose the
sale. A management group tried to buy the company when it
came up for sale, but bid about $2 million less than Nippon
Sanso. Now employees are passing around an unsigned memo
lambasting the deal and accusing Nippon Sanso of wanting to
choke off competition.
   Donald Ramlow, president of a Nippon Sanso
semiconductor-equipment subsidiary in the U.S., declined
comment. But Mr. Womersley speculated that Semi-Gas employees
may be hoping to block the transaction so they could pick up
the company at a lower price.

   U.S. Healthcare, Its Profits Strong, Seeks
   Added Clout in New York HMO Market

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   BLUE BELL, Pa. -- U.S. Healthcare Inc. expects per-share
earnings for the second quarter to be "better than 25 cents,"
Leonard Abramson, president, said.
   The executive's forecast, which is on the high side of the
range of analysts' estimates, indicates net income of at
least $11.8 million, based on the company's 47.3 million
shares outstanding in the first quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A year earlier, U.S. Healthcare, an operator of health
maintenance organizations, earned $6.6 million, or 14 cents a
share, on revenue of $242 million.
   Mr. Abramson, in an interview, also forecast that U.S.
Healthcare will have record operating earnings and revenue in
1990, as analysts expect. The company's record for earnings
dates to 1986, when operating profit was $35.8 million, or 70
cents a share. A gain on the sale of the company's interest
in a joint venture that year made net $75.8 million, or $1.48
a share.
   The company's record for annual revenue, posted in 1989,
is $1 billion.
   Mr. Abramson said U.S. Healthcare, whose HMOs are in
Middle Atlantic and New England states, is continuing its
push into the New York area. In the past 30 days, he said,
the company added four new division managers and 37 sales
people to its expansion efforts in the New York market,
including northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut, as
well as New York City.
   The company currently has about 250,000 HMO members in the
New York market, or just under one quarter of its total
membership. Mr. Abramson said he expects membership in that
market to reach one million "in the foreseeable future." He
declined to be more specific.
   U.S. Healthcare is studying a possible move into the
Baltimore and Richmond, Va., markets. It is also "looking at
the {Washington}, D.C., marketplace," though that effort is
less far along, he said.
   Mr. Abramson noted that the vast majority of U.S.
Healthcare's contracts now generally provide for flat per
diem payments, in contrast to payments for individual items,
such as the patient's room, use of the operating room and
radiological services. He added that the company is trying to
negotiate longer contracts with hospitals, to cut down on the
administrative time given to contract renewals.
   In contrast to the one-year contracts that used to be the
norm, he said, the company's contracts now average about
three years, and some stretch out for five years, though they
include "out clauses" for both parties. He said the company
is talking with a Philadelphia hospital about a 10-year
contract. "I'm going to try to move to 20-year contracts," he
said.
   Mr. Abramson said he expects U.S. Healthcare's new
quality-assurance subsidiary, U.S. Quality Algorithms Corp.,
to be up and running within nine months. The subsidiary, also
known as USQA, was formed in April with the appointment as
president of Steven L. Zatz, who expects its staff of doctors
and statisticians to grow to between 10 and 15 people by year
end. "We're going to be a model for other people to follow,"
Mr. Abramson predicted.
   He said the subsidiary initially will provide "a
statistical report card of hospitals and physicians and
laboratories that we use" at the parent company. But later,
he said, USQA will market its data analysis to corporate and
governmental buyers of health care, to insurers and to
health-care providers.
   USQA has begun to study practice patterns of the medical
specialists that U.S. Healthcare contracts with, much as the
parent has already studied those of primary-care physicians.
All the doctors in the U.S. Healthcare network are
independent practitioners.
   The first USQA study has been limited to obstetricians and
gynecologists. It looks at such strictly financial criteria
as billing practices but also at factors related to
appropriateness and thus quality, such as Caesarian section
rates. Eventually this information will help to determine
whether the company will continue contracting with the
doctors.
   About this preliminary evaluation of the specialists, Mr.
Abramson remarked, "We were surprised. Some we thought were
so good weren't so good."

   FCC Asked to Probe
   Major Networks
   Over TV Programs

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)
</GV>
<LP>
   LOS ANGELES -- A coalition of Hollywood studios and
producers asked the Federal Communications Commission to
investigate the three major broadcast networks for alleged
violations of federal rules that restrict the networks'
ownership of programs.
   The complaint is the latest salvo in an escalating and
increasingly bitter fight between Hollywood and the networks
over federal rules that block the broadcasters from the
lucrative rerun business. The allegations came as part of a
filing that the studio coalition made yesterday to the FCC,
which is about to undertake a major review of whether the
rerun rules should be eased or lifted entirely.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The networks and the Hollywood studios that supply most
prime-time series broke off all negotiations on Wednesday,
scuttling efforts to form a compromise plan advising the FCC
on how the rules should be eased. The FCC filing yesterday
made it clear that both sides now seem to have put aside
polite negotiation in favor of a bareknuckle brawl.
   Hollywood and the networks have been haggling for seven
years over the so-called Financial Interest and Syndication
Rules. Imposed by the FCC to rein in network power 20 years
ago, the rules forbid the networks from sharing in the
profits of rerun sales, a $3 billion-a-year business.
   That lucrative market has been largely left to Hollywood
producers because the rules prohibit the networks from owning
a partial stake in the shows produced for them by the
studios. The networks -- besieged by cable, News Corp.'s Fox
Television network and other competition that didn't exist 20
years ago -- want a share of the wealth and an elimination of
the rerun rules.
   In lodging the new charges -- which Hollywood officials
concede they probably wouldn't have pursued had they reached
a compromise with the ABC, NBC and CBS networks -- the
studios allege an "insidious network campaign to coerce
outside producers" into letting the networks own programs the
producers have proposed.
   Under the current FCC rules, most series are owned by
Hollywood studios and independent producers, while the
networks merely "license" the programming for two broadcasts.
A separate 1980 consent decree limits the networks to
producing at most five hours of their own prime time
programming, forcing them to rely on Hollywood for the rest.
   But the consent decree expires in November, and all three
networks have been revving up their own production units to
make more wholly-owned prime time fare. In the filing with
the FCC yesterday, the studios asked for a review of all
in-house contracts with producers for the last three years to
determine if the networks are pressing producers to make
shows under network contract rather than make them
independently and then license them to the network.
   Stephen A. Weiswasser, general counsel of Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., said the networks deny the studios' charges.
Moreover, he said, the fact that the studios didn't bother to
file their complaint before now "tells you just how serious
the complaints are."
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association,
said the studios "knew about some of these (network
practices) all the time, but we never really got into it."
Mr. Valenti said that the studios didn't want to raise the
complaints while they were still trying to iron out a
settlement with the networks. "It's just awkward," he said.
   As talks between the two sides grew more contentious,
studio officials warned network negotiators that a complaint
alleging anti-competitive practices might be filed if they
couldn't come to an agreement. Even as they bargained, the
studios had three Washington law firms taking statements from
almost 100 Hollywood producers and writers, looking for
material to be included in the complaint. "Now we're in a
fight for our lives, and we just have no choice," Mr. Valenti
said.
   In alleging network abuses, the studio coalition charged
that the networks have "acted in parallel" in forcing
producers to agree to strikingly similar terms. Though the
three networks compete for programming, the studios say the
trio uses the same license fees, the same one-year "freeze"
that keeps a series proposal off the market when a network
buys it but doesn't use it; and the same four-year contract
commitment for a series, when the producers want a shorter
term.
   The filing, made by the "Coalition to Preserve" the rules,
said that "whether the pervasive parallelism among the
networks is the result of active coordination or simply
mutual recognition of the benefits of acting in tandem, its
existence is indisputable."
   But the Department of Justice, in a separate filing to the
FCC yesterday, provided a boost to the network side of the
dispute.
   The Justice filing said the networks "don't have
sufficient market power to adversely affect" the market for
TV programming, even if they make more of their own shows.
There is "no basis in economic theory for a presumption that
network ownership" of series reruns would hurt program
production, the Justice Department said. It called the
"practical risk" of the networks winning control of the
syndication market, if the rules are lifted, "remote" and
said the network practices that the rules forbid "might
promote competition and efficiency."
   "We urge" the FCC "to eliminate the (rerun) rules unless
the Commission concludes that they are necessary to protect
the public interest in competition," the filing said.

   Bankers in Asia
   Report Scarcity
   Of Needed Talent

   Survey Finds Big Worries
   About Getting, Keeping
   Qualified Staff in Region

   HONG KONG -- Bankers throughout Asia are becoming
increasingly concerned about their ability to recruit and
retain qualified staff.
   A survey of chief executive officers of 164 banks in Asia,
conducted by Egon Zehnder International S.A., a European
executive-search company, shows that concerns about personnel
increased significantly in the past year, particularly as the
spread of liberalization has bolstered demand for qualified
staff. Throughout the region, 90% of bank executives said
hiring qualified staff was a concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The survey shows a "significant scarcity of banking talent
throughout the region," Norman Wright, managing partner for
Egon Zehnder in Southeast Asia, said.
   Personnel worries were far more widespread than just in
Hong Kong, where concerns about the reversion of the British
colony to Chinese sovereignty have prompted a steady outflow
of talent. Indeed, the greatest scarcity of banking
professionals was perceived in Indonesia, followed by Taiwan,
Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.
   The survey shows that bank executives are increasingly
optimistic about business opportunities in the region. They
said that intraregional trade and investment are of growing
importance to their business, and that several infrastructure
projects planned in Southeast Asia will provide new
opportunities for banks.
   Further, the survey shows that bank officers at corporate
headquarters don't always see things the way their
representatives in Asia do. No serious repercussions to
business were reported by local managers as a result of the
June 4, 1989, killings in pro-democracy demonstrations in
Beijing, but the officers said home-office managers were far
more bearish about prospects in China.
   Bank officers also said their colleagues outside Asia
continue to see potential for growth in the region, though
"There is a perception that the best opportunities are in the
home trading bloc," Mr. Wright of Egon Zehnder said.
   According to the survey results, banks in Asia are placing
the greatest emphasis on private banking, trade finance and
corporate lending. Regulation continues to hold back foreign
banks in several countries, though most are moving toward
liberalization, however slowly. Some of those same countries,
including Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, are expected to
offer the best opportunities for foreign banks this year.
   Hong Kong remains the region's financial center, and 71%
of the bankers who responded to the survey said their banks
will remain in the territory after 1997. The majority said
that if their banks were forced to relocate, they would
choose Singapore as a new base.
   Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. of Hong Kong and the
Citibank unit of Citicorp were rated the best and second-best
managed banks in Asia, respectively, by other bankers. The
same two banking companies led the pack in last year's
survey.

   Trump Creditors
   Work to Meet
   Deadline Today

   Donald Trump's major creditors worked last night to meet a
deadline for the beleaguered developer to make a bond payment
today.
   As negotiations crawled into the night, some people close
to the talks were pessimistic that nearly $30 million in
interest and principal on Trump's Castle bonds would be paid
as part of a massive restructuring of the casino and real
estate mogul's empire. If the interest and principal are not
made, it would be the first time Mr. Trump has missed a
scheduled payment on his approximately $1.3 billion in
publicly traded debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   People close to the negotiations stressed that even if Mr.
Trump misses the deadline, he has between 10 and 30 days
before he can be found in default.
   Four New York City banks have been trying to convince 54
smaller creditors on the merits of a plan that would allow
Mr. Trump to receive $60 million and restructure $2 billion
in bank debt, including the suspension of interest payments.
In return, Mr. Trump would forfeit equity in many of his
projects and continue to pay interest to holders of about
$1.3 billion in casino debt.
   The four banks, Bankers Trust Corp., Chase Manhattan
Corp., Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover Corp., have
declined to say whether a scheduled payment on Trump's Castle
bonds would be met. It isn't believed that such a payment
would be made until the banks strike a deal among themselves.
   Over the past week, a number of foreign banks which
participated in syndications have refused to go along with
the restructuring plan. Also, some New Jersey banks
originally balked at the proposal, although they now appear
to be amenable to the plan.
   A number of bond traders speculated that Mr. Trump's
silence and that of the banks may mean bad news. If Mr. Trump
and the banks planned to make the payment, they said, they
would have put an end to the guessing game and announced that
the money would be paid.
   Roger Stone, a political consultant who also works for Mr.
Trump, reportedly said on a television show taped yesterday
that the payment would be made. But Mr. Trump's spokesman,
Howard Rubenstein, said: "{Mr. Trump's} position is that
Roger Stone is totally uninvolved with our financial
activities and it was his own opinion and should not be
construed in any way other than that."
   Mr. Rubenstein declined to say whether Mr. Trump would
make the payment today. Another person familiar with the
situation said the trustee for the bondholders was told to be
ready to receive a payment today.
   Mr. Stone couldn't be reached for comment.

   I applaud your willingness to print the Safeway LBO
article. I am president of a moderate-sized business and have
been forced to downsize the company, so I have great empathy
for the workers and a fair understanding of business
pressures.
   It is plain to me that KKR and its predecessor in this
deal care little for the fabric that bonds employees to a
company. Mr. Magowan and senior management have earned
economic windfalls at great expense to the average, dedicated
employee. Why must such a cadre of wealthy executives stick
it so hard to the employees working in their stores?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   George Roberts pontificates that quotas and pressure to
perform are facts of life in today's world of global
competition. Most surely they are. Yet, while he roams the
world as a wealthy man delivering this message, his employees
are scraping by at lower than pre-buy-out wages. Their
families will never forget his arrogance or the policies that
stretched out severance payments over months to those who can
least afford it. It is simply revolting.
   Business can be tough, but it should establish a standard
by which it will be judged within the society. Although KKR,
Mr. Magowan and a handful of executives will continue to reap
financial rewards, it has been done in a most shameful way.

   It must be remembered that Safeway was originally
jeopardized by uninvited corporate predators. The defensive
actions that followed were then necessary and appropriate, in
my opinion.
   Our relationship with Safeway officials both before and
after the LBO shows no change in their always high regard for
other humans. Their responsibilities following the LBO were
difficult. From our vantage point, they went about their task
with integrity and sensitivity.
   Suicide, heart attack and diabetes result from lifetime
proclivities. Your effort to attribute the sole cause to
Safeway is uncommonly cruel.

   Your article presents a grim picture. It stands in sharp
contrast to our experience with the management buy-out of
Safeway's Oklahoma division. The division wasn't acquired by
a grocery chain.
   A company formed by Clayton &amp; Dubilier, along with 33
local managers, purchased the division in 1987, keeping all
5,624 employees and 106 stores. What we found when we bought
Homeland was a small, neglected part of a larger corporate
bureaucracy, starved for capital, and losing market share.
   With an ownership interest in the company conferred on
full-time employees through a stock appreciation rights
program, Homeland has developed a new entrepreneurial spirit.
In addition to growing faster and becoming more productive
since the buy-out, Homeland has added more than 1,200 new
jobs, expanded advertising expenditures 25% and, over the
past two years, invested $60 million in new stores and store
remodels compared with the $3.6 million invested by Safeway
the year before the buy-out.
   The lesson of the Safeway buy-out is not the unbalanced
portrait of despair that we were left with in your article;
it is equally a story of the remarkable benefits achievable
through the organization innovation represented by Homeland
and many similar divestiture LBOs. We have seen it many
times. Free from big-company constraints, managers and
employees who become owners of enterprises are capable of
great feats. And this is something American business sorely
needs to remain globally competitive.

   Messrs. Haft, Kravis, Magowan et al. inflicted more
suffering than if they had ridden through town on horseback
pillaging and plundering, as their spiritual forebears once
did. We see our society as more civilized now, but some of us
still regard material gain as more valuable than human life.
   The deal-makers care little that the costs of this
transaction greatly outweigh the rewards; they have kept the
gains while passing on the costs to others. Their lack of
conscience permits them to talk of "efficiency" and
"profitability" to justify dumping thousands of loyal
employees, with pitifully meager severance pay, and to treat
the remainder like overworked pack animals, driven by the
fear of their own dismissal.

Kravis and Roberts loot a business it's somehow considered

debt burdens, turn industry leaders into also-rans with
appalling consequences for employees.

   I was appalled and disgusted to read that Steve Dolinka, a
25-year Safeway employee, was fired for "theft" after he
forgot to pay for soup and toast he ate at the deli. Given
the circumstances of the man's loss of his teen-age son in a
brutal murder, no trivial oversight by him on the job in any
way justifies his dismissal. Business may be business, but
when simple human compassion is lost to this shocking degree
in any firm, the organization and its managers deserve to
fail miserably.
   Have you no shame, Mr. Magowan? The man whom you fired
even accepted the rationale for his dismissal] I extend my
belated condolences to Mr. Dolinka on the terrible loss of
his son.

   For years, I worked as a competitor of the Safeway Food
Stores. To respect them as an industry leader was prudent.
This was prior to the LBO. I left the industry for a time and
returned as a vendor, supplying services to companies like
Safeway. I am an outsider. The respect I held for the firm in
earlier years has grown significantly and I am proud to be
associated with such a fine organization. The "monsters" you
attempt to portray exist only within your misguided thought
process.
   If the same manner of expose were foisted upon any other
major company in America, the names would change but the
story would read the same. The '80s were tough on all of us.

   Your exhaustively researched and documented (but oh so
depressing) story could serve as a textbook on how the
capitalist system ought not to work. A well-managed and
prosperous business that produces and sells real goods is
basically sold as real estate to the great profit of the
paper-pushing deal-makers. Loyal, productive employees are
fired by the thousands and those remaining (except at the
very top) are required to do much more for much less. In the
affected communities, competition is reduced as market share
becomes concentrated in fewer hands. For the consumer, price
increases are accompanied by service declines as fewer
workers staff the operating units.
   The incentive for employees in this atmosphere ("you get
to keep your job") is akin to the employee-motivation methods
used in Stalinist Russia ("you get to continue breathing").
The results are about the same: a lot of poor people, a few
suicides, and an army of nine-to-fivers whose chief concern
is making quota.

   You do a masterful job describing how an LBO can enrich a
few at the expense of many and, in the process, threaten the
long-term viability of an enterprise that has been a leader
in its field.
   In 1889 my grandfather founded a chain of grocery stores
in San Diego that Charlie Merrill purchased in 1929 and that
became one of Safeway's most successful divisions. About 100
years later, Charlie's grandson Peter Magowan found it
necessary to sell the San Diego operation in order to support
the LBO.

   Any jerk in CEO's clothing -- or president's clothing or
plant manager's clothing -- can make an operation look
suddenly efficient by firing a quarter of the employees,
reducing benefits, deferring maintenance and the rest. Pay
the people for a 40-hour week but arrange it so they really
have to work 50 hours and the money rolls in like never
before.
   However, except for the CEO or president, practitioners of
this art know you must have yourself promoted away from this
kind of highly successful operation because after two or
three years the best people will begin having heart attacks,
employee divorces will increase, and employee unhappiness
will become an unrecognized, unquantified drag on profits.

   In March of this year, Safeway and Safeway's employees
presented the second-largest check ever given on the National
Easter Seal Telethon -- a check for $4.1 million, which was
an increase of $2.5 million over 1989. A company without a
heart, a company with disgruntled and unhappy employees could
hardly be expected to perform such a miracle.
   Safeway also remains one of the major contributors to food
banks and feeding programs around the country, and its

   I was struck that this entire affair was one of excesses:
Employees and unions overreached and asked too high a wage;
management and stockholders wanted too great a profit; the
banks, investment houses and deal-makers eschewed reasonable
fees and exacted egregious levies. Hence, any merit this LBO
might claim is overshadowed by the embarrassment of riches
enjoyed by some and the tragic losses endured by others.
   Some restraint on the part of all would have won big for
all. A concern for ethics and morality (there is a place for
these in the business world) might have tempered the
attitudes, resulting in a happier outcome. As it was, the
conduct and consequences seem more like war than diplomacy,
the tools used more like chain saws than pruning shears.

   I read the article with fascinated horror. All I could
think of was the story of Coriolanus, the Roman patrician who
so hated the common people that he even opposed the free
distribution of corn when the city was in the grip of a
terrible famine. Not surprisingly, he was expelled from Rome.
He retaliated by gathering up an army of Rome's enemies and
marching on the city.
   The women of Rome appealed to his aged mother, Veturia, to
intercede. Supported by her daughter-in-law and grandsons,
she walked out of the city gates to the enemy camp. The
historian Livy describes how seeing his mother, Coriolanus
ran forward and "would have embraced her had he not been
checked by her sudden turn to anger. `I would know,' she
said, `before I accept your kiss, whether I have come to an
enemy or a son.'" She then upbraided him in no uncertain
terms for his treachery to his own people. Weeping, he fell
at her feet and begged forgiveness.
   It hardly takes effort to see Coriolanus in Mr. Magowan.
But if only his mother bore some resemblance to Veturia]
Alas, what might have been a triumphant story is destined for
Greek tragedy.

   We have been a major supplier to Safeway Stores for more
than 50 years. We have always worked closely with Safeway,
particularly during the time when it went through its LBO.
   There is no question in our minds that Mr. Magowan and his
associates have been able to accomplish a complete turnaround
for the Safeway organization. In our judgment, Safeway would
not have made it through the 1980s if it had not restructured
its organization in order to address its competitive position
in the marketplace. Today, Safeway is alive and well and a
leader in the industry on a number of key financial
measurements. This is indeed a remarkable success story and a
company where 100,000 people are still productively employed.
   Our free-enterprise system does not work without pain, and
we all know that from time to time difficult decisions must
be made to stay competitive in a fast-changing market.
Safeway made those decisions in the late 1980s and, as a
result, is a strong viable competitor in the retail-grocery
business.

   FCC Proposes Rules to Rein In Firms
   That Provide Phone-Operator Services

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
proposed rules to rein in businesses that provide
telephone-operator services.
   But it stopped short of moving to regulate rates. Instead,
it proposed to solve the problem of price gouging with an
approach that relies on informed consumers and technical
requirements to prevent blocked calls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission voted 5-0 to ask for public comment on a
package that would require operator services, as well as
hotels, airports, hospitals and other businesses with many
public phones, to provide customers with rate and other
information and connections to the phone company of their
choice.
   Operator businesses generally link callers to
long-distance carriers. Some provide multilingual operators
or other special services for callers. But most of the new
operator-services companies inflate charges and give hotels
or airports, for example, a percentage of the collections.
Companies with many public telephones have begun to view
phones as a profit center and have contracted with these
operator-services businesses.
   Operator services and companies that contract with them,
such as hotel chains, would be required not only to identify
the company that is handling customers' calls and provide
rate information but also to provide instructions on how
customers can gain access to the long-distance carrier they
want.
   Since 1988, when the pay-phone and operator-services
business was largely deregulated, the commission has been
flooded with thousands of consumer complaints about
unscrupulous operator services. Even the commissioners had
their war stories.
   Commissioner Ervin Duggan regaled the crowded FCC
auditorium at the agency's regular monthly meeting with a
tale of his unsuccessful efforts to get a $3 refund from a
pay-phone operator. "I held out for physical torture," he
said. Commissioner Sherrie Marshall told of her frustration
in trying to get a connection at an airport phone to the
long-distance company she uses. And Commissioner Andrew
Barrett joked that perhaps the agency's enforcement division
could help get a refund of a 43% surcharge an Atlanta hotel
tacked onto his phone charges.
   Under the FCC proposal, telephone-operator companies and
phone-service suppliers couldn't block access to a caller's
carrier of choice. For example, a hotel guest using a phone
linked to one long-distance carrier would have to be allowed
to connect to another carrier; moreover, the hotel and the
operator-services company would be required to tell the
consumer how to make that connection.
   The agency also is considering requiring modifications in
telephone equipment that would allow customers to reach the
long-distance carrier of their choice by dialing an access
code. The proposed package would require that local telephone
companies, such as the regional Bells, give customers
information about how to reach their long-distance company,
and that the phone companies publish this information in
their white-pages directories.
   The period for public comments on the proposal and
responses runs for about five months.
   The proposal drew immediate criticism from consumer
groups, which complained that it doesn't go far enough in
protecting callers. David Wagenhauser, executive director of
the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, said the
agency's proposal is evidence that "the commission will
continue to give alternative operator-services companies
carte blanche to gouge the American public." The commission,
he said, "should be less concerned about reading and writing
{providing consumer information} and more concerned about
arithmetic -- the rates charged by these companies."
   Legislation being considered in Congress would make rates
subject to FCC regulation. But FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes
warned against taking that approach, calling it a "mistake
for Congress to pass legislation requiring the FCC to get
involved in tariffing of alternative operator-service
providers."
   In February 1989, the commission tried to address the
problem with mild restrictions on five operator-services
companies. The companies were required to identify themselves
to each caller and to place stickers on the telephones or
placards nearby, listing their names and numbers to call for
more information about the services.
   Separately, the commission adopted rules designed to keep
youngsters from calling pornography services.
   The regulations, adopted by a 5-0 vote, require
dial-a-porn lines to use credit-card verification, subscriber
access codes or messages scrambled in such a way that
prevents children under 18 years old from being able to
listen.
   The dial-a-porn companies also must notify telephone
companies that they provide adult services and that the
services are subject to billing notification as adult-message
services. Local phone companies are generally required to
block adult services, unless a phone subscriber requests that
the numbers be unblocked.

   I don't recall ever having seen a more one-sided story in
the Journal than the Safeway article on page one May 16. Your
thesis in the article that the Safeway LBO is responsible for
or the primary cause of a whole host of "human costs" that
otherwise would not have occurred is both distorted and
unsound. Safeway is a smaller but better company than it was
in 1986. Its employees have more security as part of a
growing and profitable company. This could not be without the
actions that have taken place over the past three years.
   A brief look at a summary of supposed consequences of the
LBO reveals it to be a ludicrous insult to common sense. You
imply or directly state that the Safeway LBO is responsible
for the following:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Killing people, heart attacks, suicides and attempted
suicides, a broken marriage engagement, a college dropout and
a nationwide shortage of engineers, car repossessions, age
discrimination, quotas, homelessness, sweatshop conditions, a
seven-day-week wage discrimination, cuts in charitable
contributions and mortgage foreclosures.
   That's some powerful, heartless financing technique.
   The indictment is wrong. Safeway employs more than 100,000
men and women. When you employ that many people, there are
naturally going to be events in their lives that are unhappy
and tragic, no matter what happens at the company. But to
assert or imply that an economic transaction is the primary
cause or factor in a tragic event like a heart attack or
suicide is to betray a bias that is so sharp and so deep that
it defies reasonable discussion, not to mention demonstrating
a total misunderstanding of the human heart. We discussed all
these matters with you over a period of three months.
   Most important, you never confronted the real question:
the costs of change vs. the costs of no change. Never once
did you mention the primary reason for most of the changes
that took place at Safeway: labor costs that were out of
line, the consequences, long and short term, of those costs,
and the absolute business necessity in a low-margin, highly
competitive industry for parity of labor costs. Safeway had
to confront its major business problem -- labor costs that
were so out of line with its nonunion competition that they
caused a situation where 66% of the company was either making
no money or losing money.
   It was this that caused the pressures for and the need for
change at Safeway. And it was this business problem, LBO or
not, that had to be solved. The bleeding had to stop. The
most important effect of the LBO was to highlight this need
and provide the urgency and incentive to act quickly.
   The consequences of choosing to act are sometimes hard,
and sometimes they do not fall equally across the board. But
your portrait is a reflection of this in a funhouse mirror.
In the case of the Safeway corporate staff, that staff had to
be cut to match the smaller size of the company. There was no
alternative. Staff cuts have taken place at other major
companies, all over America, to reflect their business
realities. If you write about the consequences of such cuts,
why confine yourself to LBOs? Or perhaps only LBO staff cuts
cause "a heavy human toll."
   Unions faced a hard choice: Either they and their members
accepted the fact that they would have to adjust their wage
demands to make them more competitive with the labor forces
Safeway and they were competing with, or the management of
Safeway would either quickly sell or close the stores.
Regardless of the LBO, that problem had to be faced. It is to
the great credit of the union officials with whom we
bargained that after the sale of our Dallas division they
recognized the dilemma forced on us by the Hafts and were
willing to work with us to minimize the impact.
   Many companies faced the same problems that Safeway did.
It is the history of the grocery business in the '80s that
wage parity was being requested everywhere. Yet Safeway dealt
with its problems not perfectly, but in as humane a manner as
it could, and it came through. We believe that if you were to
ask international union officials, they would confirm that
Safeway worked very hard and in good faith to ensure that
people buying our divisions would also hire our employees.
The consequences to all of the company's constituents would
have been far worse if we had ignored those problems. The
facts are that the overwhelming majority of our employees are
working at higher wage rates and with more benefits than was
the case at the time of the buy-out. By focusing solely on
selected, individual, anecdotal portraits of the purported
individual costs of change, you ignored the larger business
and human reality.
   The financial success of the company is "kissed off" in
one or two paragraphs stating that the company has "raised
productivity and operating profits." Among the things that
did not appear in your lengthy article:
   -- Operating profit in 1989 was higher ($462 million) on
$14 billion of sales than it used to be in 1986 on $20
billion of sales. That is no small achievement.
   -- Our 1989 operating profit margin of 3.2% ranked Safeway
third of the top 10 food chains.
   -- Our operating cash flow of 5.2% of sales in 1989 ranked
us first of the five leading food chains.
   -- Our debt has been reduced from $5.7 billion to $3.1
billion.
   To not include these key aspects of our financial
performance is misleading to say the least -- especially when
you do include, "The company's net income was only $2.5
million last year, down from $31 million the year before."
   The good news for Safeway's customers wasn't mentioned at
all. Safeway's prices are more competitive than any time in
the past 10 years. We have more service in our stores (39%
more employee hours per store than in 1985). Our service is
not only better, it is friendlier. We remodeled 200 stores in
the past few years to add all the specialty departments our
customers want.
   A balanced portrait of what happened at Safeway would have
explained what happened and why.
   Finally, I believe your article seeks to establish a new
measure by which corporate behavior should be evaluated --
providing guaranteed lifetime employment. It judges the
success of corporate behavior primarily on that criterion
regardless of other business or financial consequences. As
such, I feel it is the most anti-investorbiased article
imaginable. It implicitly tells corporate management and
investors: Don't do the right thing by taking the painful
measures you know are necessary to ensure the health of the
business in the future, and forget about shareholder value if
it requires tough action. Don't do it because The Wall Street
Journal will be there to impose its own "reckoning."
   Readers may well ask themselves: Who pays the ultimate
price to be extracted for investing according to the new
standard you are imposing?

   Your article contains false assertions and misquotes that
I consider to be most serious.
   The writer indicates that my son Peter, chairman of
Safeway, was "pressed" by me in 1986: "Will anyone get hurt?
Will anyone lose his job?" in the process of Safeway's LBO.
The story stated that I expressed concern that the company's
longstanding reputation as a benevolent employer not be
damaged by the LBO. Both of these statements are untrue.
Peter and I had no such conversation, and I highly resent
having been quoted in this fashion.
   In the changing economic climate of the past decade,
hostile takeovers have been commonplace. When the Haft family
announced its intention to buy up Safeway, many very serious
and long-reaching decisions had to be made by management in a
short period of time.
   In any takeover situation, it is a given that jobs will be
lost. Every effort was made to minimize this effect.
   In addition, I extremely resent the intrusion of your
reporter into my home. She telephoned me requesting an
interview "about the good old days at Safeway," and was told
a day or two later by my assistant that as policy I do not
meet with the press. Disregarding this, she showed up at my
home uninvited. As I had no intention of speaking with her,
it was necessary to ask her to leave my home. I very much
resent her disrespect for my wishes and privacy, as well as
her inaccurate portrayal of a conversation between my son and
me.
   Peter is a man of high moral character, integrity,
sincerity and honesty. He and the management team have
consistently attempted to preserve as much of the "old"
Safeway as possible under very trying and altered
circumstances.

   SCARSDALE, N.Y. -- All went well at first when Japanese
executives began moving into this leafy New York suburb,
which writer Diana Trilling once called "the nerve-center of
progressive middle-middle-class America."
   The children of the Japanese who came here in the 1970s
attended the local schools, learned English and made American
friends. Scarsdale school kids were delighted to have
classmates from an exotic and faraway land.
   But as the number of Japanese increased, the atmosphere of
comity began to change. Today, 17% of Scarsdale High's
students are Japanese, and resulting problems have led the
school to form a "prejudice reduction committee."
   The Japanese students now socialize mainly with each
other, make fewer American friends, learn less English and
lock themselves into a self-reinforcing segregation. The
American students complain that the Japanese ruin the
mathematics grading curve, and they seem to view the Japanese
as an alien and somewhat threatening force.
   "There's always this feeling: I don't know what they're
talking about," says Torie Sewell, a 15-year-old sophomore.
"Maybe they're talking about me. Maybe they're saying they
hate Americans."
   As the U.S. and Japan move into an era of shared world
leadership, the young people in both countries will be
leading the way. In some respects, they offer great hope.
They are free from the scars of World War II that distorted
relations between their parents and they share the great
global pulse of popular culture.
   Yet while the world is shrinking under the influence of
satellite television, jumbo jets and fax machines, visits
with dozens of young people in both countries suggest that
the chasm between the two cultures is as wide as ever --
maybe wider.
   Many young Americans share their parents' concerns about
their nation's status in the world, but aren't always
inspired to do much about it. Japanese young people,
meanwhile, seem more overtly nationalistic than their elders,
and more resentful of the U.S. and what they see as its
bullying ways.
   Even Shintaro Ishihara, the Diet member whose
anti-American statements have made him the current "bete
noir" of U.S.-Japan relations, is surprised by Japanese young
people. "Japanese teen-agers," he warns, "are much more
dangerous than me." Kenichi Takemura, a popular Japanese
television commentator, observes: "The youngsters have not
experienced the bombing by B-29s. The war does not live in
their minds. So they get the idea Japan can be arrogant."
   A surprising sign of changing attitudes among Japan's
younger generation can be seen in a Wall Street Journal poll
in Japan that asked: "In the unlikely event your country were
to go to war in the future, which country do you think would
be the most likely opponent." Just over 10% of respondents
over the age of 50 said the U.S. However, that figure rose to
25% for respondents under the age of 30.
   ---
   Housed in a sprawling old brick building, Scarsdale High
School might seem insulated from the economic concerns of the
outside world. But its students are clearly attuned to the
shifting fortunes of the U.S. and Japan. American students
make quips in the hallways about Japanese imperialism. And
many students here, Japanese and American, feel Japan has
already surpassed the U.S. in economic power.
   "It will be said in a gibing tone -- `Oh, the Japanese are
taking over America,'" says Ms. Sewell, an outgoing young
woman with straight blond hair. "But you can also see the
seriousness in it."
   "The Japanese are so obvious in what they have," says
Chris Lopez, a junior. "You see Japanese cars all over the
world. People feel resentment. We're Americans. We're
supposed to have everything. And when they stay off by
themselves, people say, `They think they're better.'"
   Such resentment seldom surfaces in blatant acts of
discrimination, but it sets a subtle tone for relations
between the two groups. "It's difficult for the Americans to
figure out what the Japanese are thinking," says Brian
Fisher, a senior at the school. "They really isolate
themselves." Mr. Lopez says the general attitude of his
friends is that Japanese students "aren't fun. They're not
easy to get to know."
   For their part, the Japanese complain of a subtle
prejudice. "I'm trying not to think it's because of racism,"
says Takuma Hayashi, a senior who has lived in the U.S. since
fifth grade. "I'm trying to think it's lack of
communication."
   "It's really a lack of our efforts and a lack of their
consideration toward our problems," says Yuki Yamabe, another
Scarsdale High student.
   Many of the Japanese students, especially the girls, are
also under pressure from home to steer clear of American
ways. "The girls' parents don't want them to become
Americanized," says Kaori Aoyama, whose father was even
unhappy that she got her ears pierced. "Most of the girls'
parents are worried about sex. They want us to be Japanese
ladies. They never say, `Don't associate with American
students,' but they do always remind us: `You are Japanese.'"
   In some ways, the nature of American education baffles
Japanese students. In social studies classes, they are called
on to express and defend opinions, something that seldom
happens in Japanese schools. In science, says Naomi Morii,
who has a son in the 10th grade, "they do lots of
investigation, go to the zoo, do experiments. In Japan, the
teacher gives information, and you study and memorize."
   Homework takes much longer for the Japanese because they
have to look up so many English words. And on top of their
regular studies, most also attend some sort of after-school
Japanese program to prepare for Japan's rigorous
college-entrance exams.
   Their reaction to these conflicting demands is to redouble
their efforts. As a result, their teachers say, many Japanese
show up bleary-eyed and groggy from studying late into the
night.
   "All the American teachers say, `Don't work so hard. Stop
after two hours. You're going to break your health,'" says
Ms. Yamabe. "But if we don't work hard, we won't get the
grade and won't get into college. If I stop after two hours,
there's nothing on the paper."
   These study habits reinforce their isolation. "I tried to
make American friends, and I did, but the life is so
different," says Ms. Yamabe. "After school, they can play. If
they ask me to stay over at their house, I can't because I
have homework. And so I started to lose my American friends."
   That hard work is yet another source of irritation among
the American students, who aren't willing to quit the
football team or the debating team to put in the extra hours
on studies. And when it comes to mathematics, the Americans
figure even extra hours wouldn't be enough. The Japanese
students come to Scarsdale with a much more intense math
background. "They seem on such a higher plateau in math,"
says Ms. Sewell. "It's like, they're so much better, why even
bother?"
   "There's a kid in my class who literally sleeps through
class -- and he gets A's," chimes in Mr. Lopez.
   This defeatism seems to be reflected in the students'
views on broader issues, like American competitiveness. "I'm
not willing to make the sacrifice that it would take to be
No. 1," says Mr. Lopez. "Working long hours without pay,
sacrificing yourself for your country -- that's not worth
it."
   "A lot of people feel that way," says Ms. Sewell. "But
they still don't like it when the people that are beating us
are right next door."
   ---
   Unlike American culture, with its celebration of the
rugged individualist, the Japanese ethic has emphasized
suppression of individual desires for the good of the group,
the company, the nation. These days, though, "kojinshugi" --
individualism -- is a word heard more and more, and almost
always in reference to younger people, such as Hiroya Kanda.
   On a rainy Saturday afternoon, he sits with two friends in
a stylish coffee shop in downtown Tokyo. The three are
dressed for tennis.
   "Younger people are really different from the older
generation," says Mr. Kanda, a 29-year-old manager at the
LongTerm Credit Bank of Japan. Until a few years ago,
Saturday was a workday at the bank, and Sunday the only day
off. Now, while Mr. Kanda still works as late as 7 or 8 p.m.
during the week, his Saturdays and Sundays are free. The
nature of that free time has changed too. His elders might
spend their leisure time playing golf with colleagues or
business partners, but Mr. Kanda says he avoids golf because
it reminds him too much of work. His preference: tennis or
touring the countryside.
   Unlike many older Japanese, who take an "it can't be
helped" attitude toward Japan's cramped standard of living,
Mr. Kanda fantasizes about a better life. "I think Americans
are much richer than Japanese," he says. "They live in larger
houses with pools, tennis courts. Here the companies and the
country may be rich, but the people are poor." The older
generation may have worked for the company or the country,
but Mr. Kanda has a different idea. "I work for myself," he
says.
   His views aren't unusual in today's Japan, where young
people are striving for more freedom. Yukio Okamoto, a
division director at Japan's foreign ministry, tells a story
of one of his young staffers who recently declined an
invitation to go drinking with his boss because "he had plans
to go listen to a new CD with his wife. In my days," Mr.
Okamoto says, "an invitation from a director was a godsend.
You would never turn it down."
   Still, the pull of tradition can't be underestimated.
Japanese young people still work longer hours than their
American counterparts. Most still expect to be with the same
company all their working lives, unable to switch jobs even
if they feel mistreated. And the late trains that leave Tokyo
each evening are still packed full of young men, who spent
the evening on the town with their colleagues rather than at
home with their families.
   "The young are changing, but as they go up into the
corporate hierarchy they get assimilated," says Masahiko
Ishizuka, an editorial writer for the Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
"The grip of Japan's corporate life style is unexpectedly
strong."
   And even Mr. Kanda, for all his Western sentiments, sees
much about the West he doesn't like. "The ratio of lazy
persons is much higher in the U.S," he says. Moreover, "We
have a longer history than the U.S.A. We should be proud of
our own culture. We must export our culture."
   The paradox of today's young Japanese is that the same
kids who eat up American pop culture -- from McDonalds'
hamburgers to the Billboard Top 40 -- want the world to
recognize the greatness of their own country's culture. If
they are more and more like Americans, that doesn't mean they
necessarily like Americans.
   The older generation was reared in the immediate post-war
years, still bearing the shame of the war and grateful for
U.S. generosity during and immediately after the occupation;
the younger generation, in contrast, seems prouder of Japan's
accomplishments -- and more resentful of what they see as
American hectoring. This sense of national pride bordering on
chauvinism is readily apparent in an evening of eating and
drinking with members of Kyoto University's judo club.
   "We're too subservient to Americans," says Atsuhiro Noda,
a 21-year-old engineering student. "If there's a massacre in
Poland, Japan would be very eager to criticize. But if it's
done by the U.S., Japan would hesitate to criticize. Japan
should have its own stance. Japan should be standing on an
equal footing."
   Masafumi Okuda, the team's 22-year-old captain, agrees. "I
think Japan should have its own military capacity," he says.
"It's abnormal to rely on the U.S." Mr. Okuda thinks the
American troops based in Japan "should be allowed to go
home."
   To be sure, such feelings aren't unanimous within the
group. Koji Kawakami, a 19-year-old sophomore, worries that
with Japan "behaving like a `nouveau riche'" on the world
stage, the U.S. and others will abandon it to isolation. "I'm
not accepting a subservient attitude, but the world situation
doesn't allow a {Japanese} military buildup," he says. But
most of them think their country should occupy a place in the
world as a strong nation, independent of American influence.
   Their attitude is evident even in the sport they have
chosen. Judo requires three grueling hours a day of training,
and those who choose it do so, in part, out of a loyalty to
the traditional Japanese notion that effort is good for its
own sake. Mr. Okuda has a cauliflower ear that is testimony
to the sport's rigors; it's a badge of honor for judo experts
that comes from constantly rubbing against rough floor mats
during matches.
   Not surprisingly, Mr. Noda doesn't have much regard for
American athletes. "Americans are much bigger, so they resort
to power rather than skill," he says. But judo, he suggests
with satisfaction, is a sport where power doesn't count for
much and skill is everything.
   If these judo team members represent the traditionalism in
today's young Japanese, many young women represent change.
Women suffer the most from their country's rigid social and
business structure, and over breakfast at Tokyo's Palace
Hotel, four young career women freely talk about their
frustrations.
   The four currently work for Grey Daiko Advertising Inc.,
an American-affiliated firm in Tokyo. They like the company
because, ironically, it offers them better opportunities than
they would find in a Japanese firm. Yasuko Furuichi, a
28-year-old account executive, supposes that some Japanese
companies may be open to women. But she joined a foreign firm
because "I want to play it safe. I have talked to women in
Japanese companies, and I'm sure I can't survive there."
   Toshiko Tsuchiya, a 29-year-old account executive,
desribes how she once worked for a Japanese travel company.
For three weeks a month, she led tours, doing the same work
as men her age. But during the one week each month the tour
guides spent in the office, she and the other women had to
wear uniforms and serve tea.
   Family pressures are intense as well. Mayumi Honda grew up
in the conservative town of Hamamatsu. Her father doesn't
like her working, and her family is concerned that at the
"old" age of 25, she remains single. "They wanted to have an
arranged marriage for me," she says. "Older people think
that's good."
   Perhaps because of their own frustrations, these young
women are generally sympathetic toward the U.S. in its
sometimes prickly relations with their country. "Sometimes I
wish the U.S. would speak louder" in making trade demands,
says Ms. Furuichi. "The Japanese government won't change
internally. The only way to change is through outside
pressure."
   But they see little hope their society will address the
things that matter most to them, such as the country's
crowded living conditions. "The source of the problem is that
Japanese people are trained not to fight against the
establishment," says Kiyoko Tsujita, a 25-year-old
copywriter.
   If anyone understands the difficulty of meshing Japanese
and American culture, and how that may affect Japan's role in
the world, it is Arseny Besher, a colleague of the women at
Grey-Daiko.
   Mr. Besher is the product of both worlds. Sandy-haired and
unquestionably Caucasian, he nonetheless is a native-born
Japanese. His parents were the children of Russian emigres
living in Shanghai, who fled to Japan after the Communists
took over. Mr. Besher was born in 1962 in Kobe, making him an
official Japanese citizen under an obscure law covering
people born of stateless parents.
   While he is a Japanese citizen, no one in Japan -- except
his childhood nanny -- has ever treated him as a native. On a
recent trip to Thailand, the customs officer at Bangkok
airport asked Mr. Besher why he had a Japanese passport.
   "Because I'm Japanese," he replied.
   The customs officer thought for a second and then asked
why Mr. Besher was Japanese.
   "Because I have a Japanese passport," he replied.
   Mr. Besher thrived in his Japanese grade school, but high
school at a prestigious San Francisco institution was more of
a problem. He arrived speaking only Russian and Japanese, and
he disliked the teachers, whose goal as he saw it wasn't to
educate but to get their students into big-name colleges. Mr.
Besher instead chose St. John's, a small "Great Books"
college with campuses in Annapolis, Md., and Santa Fe, N.M.
In the end, however, he still felt "more alienated in
America," and returned to Japan after graduation.
   Yet Mr. Besher wonders what a world under Japanese
leadership might be like. While Japanese profess allegiance
to democratic values, he wonders just how deep those beliefs
go. In Japan, he says, the appearance of having a certain
attitude can be as important as the attitude itself: "Do you
appear friendly? Do you appear intelligent? Do you appear
democratic? But you don't hear people say someone is really
intelligent. Or really democratic. That's private. There are
aspects of their beliefs they don't choose to share."
   He believes the government tries to discourage young
people from thinking for themselves. The education ministry,
he contends, has made clear for 20 years that it wants
schools to turn out people who can "solve problems" but who
won't "seek answers" -- people who can use math and
linguistics to "contribute to Japan through industry," not as
voters and citizens. Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, he
claims, "want no part of a society where they have to listen
to the masses."
   Mr. Besher says it isn't clear that those bureaucrats and
politicians want a leadership role in the world. But that,
too, could be a matter of appearances. "They don't have to
control the wheel," he says. "But they want to own it."

   TORONTO -- The board of Bramalea Ltd. is expected to
announce after its meeting this morning that Benjamin Swirksy
will resign as president and chief executive, according to a
source close the company.
   It is expected that Mr. Swirsky's replacement will be
Marvin Marshall, president and chief executive of Cullen
Center Inc., of Houston, Texas, an office complex owned by
Trizec Corp., of Calgary, Alberta, the source said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bramalea declined to comment, and Mr. Marshall couldn't be
reached for comment, although a source indicated that he is
in Toronto today.
   At the board meeting, Mr. Swirsky is expected to be named
vice chairman of Bramalea. He will remain a director and a
member of its executive committee, but he won't have an
active role in the company's day-to-day operations. It is
expected that Mr. Swirsky will be appointed to the board of
Carena Developments Ltd., and have a senior advisory role
with that concern.
   Bramalea is a real estate concern based in Toronto. It is
66%-owned by Trizec, which is controlled by Toronto
financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman through Carena. Trizec
also is 36%-owned by the Reichmann family's Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd., of Toronto.
   Analysts view Mr. Marshall's appointment to the head of
Bramalea as a sign that Trizec will exert more influence on
Bramalea's business decisions. From his experience in
Houston, Mr. Marshall knows how to operate in a tough real
estate market, and Bramalea likely will need that kind of
management, analysts said.

   WASHINGTON -- The International Development Association, a
World Bank affiliate, authorized a $150 million loan to China
to help farmers increase production of food crops, fruit,
livestock and shrimp and fish on farm-type ponds.
   The World Bank also is considering other loans to China,
but has been forced to delay action on several, including a
proposed $150 million loan to help finance transportation
projects. In the wake of China's crackdown in June 1989 on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing and other Chinese
cities, the U.S. and other member countries of the World Bank
have blocked approval of some loans to China. However, the
U.S. has said it wouldn't oppose approval of loans that serve
"humanitarian" purposes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A senior World Bank official said the approval of the IDA
credit to China brings the total newly authorized World Bank
credits to that country to $590 million during the bank's
current fiscal year, which ends June 30.
   Separately, the World Bank approved a $385 million loan to
Eletrobras, Brazil's national power company, to improve
electric power transmission networks of nine regional
utilities serving many parts of the country.
   Meanwhile, the World Bank said it will guarantee the
principal on a $100 million fixed-rate, 15-year bond issue of
India's Housing Development Finance Corp., to be placed in
the U.S. market by Salomon Brothers, a New York investment
banking company.
   The bank said this was its first such guarantee under its
expanded co-financing program, which is intended to help
eligible borrowing countries obtain financing in a broad
range of financial markets.

   It has taken less than a week after Californians voted
narrowly to raise the gasoline tax with Prop. 111 for the
state's top Democrats to go whole-hog on taxes. As the
cornerstone of a $2.3 billion tax package (the Gann spending
limit won't allow any more than that), the Democratic
chairmen of the Legislature's fiscal committees want to raise
the upper income-tax bracket to 11% from 9.3%. Apparently,
revenue growth of 7% annually hasn't kept pace with spending,
so there's a big deficit and the liberal reflex is to try to
soak many of the state's most productive residents further.
Even after Prop. 111's win, however, the Big Democratic Tax
Sponge may find California a pretty dry state.

   Meanwhile, a small piece of evidence has emerged to
challenge Prop. 111's supposed lesson that voters will
approve a tax if they know it will go for a specific program.
This week North Dakotans voted 59% against a temporary,
one-cent sales-tax increase to fund schools. Earmarking the
money for education didn't help -- last December North
Dakotans turned down a non-earmarked sales-tax hike by a
narrower 53% margin. The real lesson may be that voters won't
support tax increases for programs that they are convinced
fail to deliver value for money.

   Mosbacher Says `Serious' Credit Crunch
   Grips U.S., Isn't Limited to Real Estate

   WASHINGTON -- Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the
U.S. is caught in a serious credit crunch that extends well
beyond the real estate industry and appears to be worsening.
   "It is serious, and it appears to be exacerbating," he
said in an interview. "It's not just real estate people. Real
estate is very serious. But it also has to do with small and
middle-sized businesses, high-tech, across the board,
{businesses} who are trying to get loans and can't."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Mosbacher's statements were the strongest yet from a
top administration official on the nation's credit squeeze.
Treasury and Federal Reserve Board officials have attempted
to play down the problem, arguing it is largely limited to
the real estate industry and to certain regions of the
country.
   The commerce secretary also called on the Federal Reserve
to bring down interest rates. "I feel it {monetary policy} is
on the tight side, frankly," he said. "I think it would be a
good time to move towards easing. {Fed Chairman} Alan
Greenspan has done a good job overall, but frankly,
inflationary pressures have cooled, and the slow growth we're
experiencing, along with this credit crunch, is a good reason
to ease."
   In a speech on the Senate floor late last night, New
Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici sternly criticized the Fed for
being too tight, citing his fears that Fed policy is
exacerbating the credit crunch. Noting the slow growth of the
economy and the "ameliorating" inflation outlook, the senior
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee added: "I say to
the Federal Reserve Board: What are you trying to fix? Are
you trying to fix inflation? I don't believe it needs any
fixes right now."
   Mr. Mosbacher spoke briefly about the credit crunch at a
hearing on competitiveness held yesterday by the Senate
Banking Committee and then expanded on his comments in a
telephone interview.
   After a separate hearing at the House Banking Committee,
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp also complained about the squeeze
on credit. "There is a credit crunch," Mr. Kemp said. "No
doubt about it."
   Mr. Mosbacher said there has to be "some serious attention
paid" to the credit problem. But he was circumspect about
placing blame.
   "I'm not saying it's the banks, or the bank examiners or
the Federal Reserve," he said. But he added: "The banks, of
course, have a problem. Privately they will tell you they are
having a hard time with the bank examiners. I don't know
{whether} they will tell you that for quote."
   Mr. Mosbacher disputed the notion that credit problems are
concentrated in certain regions such as New England or Texas.
"It's not regional," he said. "It's pretty much across the
whole country."
   Since early this year, many U.S. companies have complained
of the difficulty of getting banks to approve loans. Banks,
in turn, have blamed tightening standards among regulators in
the wake of widespread failures and scandals in the
savings-and-loan industry.
   Treasury officials continue to argue there is no evidence
of a broad, across-the-board credit crunch. Despite anecdotal
evidence of a credit squeeze, they and Federal Reserve
officials have insisted there are no data showing the problem
to be widespread. Moreover, Treasury officials have avoided
making sweeping public statements on the subject because they
don't want to worsen public concern.
   Mr. Mosbacher, however, dismissed arguments by government
and private economists that the problem isn't widespread. "I
think the economists, when they look at the figures, are
missing it," he said.
   The Senate Banking Committee plans to hold hearings next
week on the credit issue. It has invited Mr. Greenspan as
well as Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William
Seidman and Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke to
testify.

   Under the pact, Exxon would reduce emissions from its
Bayway refinery in Linden, N.J., to 30 pounds or less an
hour, from current levels of about 45-to-70-pounds of mineral
dusts, sulfuric acid and sulfates. About 4.2 million gallons
of gasoline and 200,000 gallons of fuel oil are produced at
the facility daily.

   New Jersey state officials said that "Exxon's record of
non-compliance with anti-pollution regulations dates back 10
years." State officials also said the oil concern has paid
fines for non-compliance in the past two years.
   A spokesman for the company confirmed that it has paid
fines in the past for failure to comply, but said that the
non-compliance was unavoidable and "no attempt was made at
anytime to try to do anything surreptitiously." Exxon is
currently performing maintenance work at the Bayway facility
in an effort to meet "stringent New Jersey standards" by the
October deadline.
   The spokesman added that the company is prepared to
design, engineer and construct within 2 1/2 years -- at a
cost of over $30 million -- a new system that will meet New
Jersey standards, if the company cannot renovate existing
equipment to meet those standards.

   Spooked by late afternoon rumors of a collapse on Wall
Street, London shares finished near the day's worst levels
amid moderate trading.
   Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks advanced firmly, paying little
regard to steady profit-taking. Traders said that buyers were
enticed by bargain prices and speculative plays, while a
stronger bond market lent underlying support to stocks.

   Dealers in London said shares there powered ahead
throughout most of the session on a combination of a stock
shortage in the blue-chip leaders as well as robust demand
for stock-index futures.
   But talk late in the day that shares in a major U.S.
computer mainframe maker had been suspended on Wall Street
sparked a sell-off in London, bringing with it talk of
imminent doom and gloom, some market professionals said.
   However, a handful of traders said the market's slide
after several sessions of gains wasn't a worrisome
development. Some traders even said that the broad-based
index's ability to close above 2400 points was a healthy
signal.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
2.4 points to 2403, well below the midmorning peak of 2430.5
and just a shade better than the late afternoon low of
2401.9.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index dropped 4.6 points to
1928.6. Volume was 554.2 million shares, compared with 611.2
million shares Wednesday.
   In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
finished at 2436, slightly better than Wednesday's 2431.5.
   As a sector, brewers were hit on news that the European
Community completed a review of the European beer market that
could have serious implications for the brewing industry in
the U.K.
   Allied-Lyons shed 8 pence to 506 pence (14 cents to
$8.66), Guinness dropped 14 pence to 788 pence, Grand
Metropolitan slipped 5 pence to 667 pence, Whitbread lost 9
pence to 451 pence, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle dropped 3 pence
to 334 pence. Against the negative trend, Bass advanced 8
pence to #10.93.
   Cable &amp; Wireless retreated 13 pence to 556 pence, while
Racal Electronics lost 12 pence to 200 pence and Racal
Telecom dropped 24 pence to 346 pence. All three companies
disclosed full-year earnings a day earlier, and the market
sold the stocks yesterday on further consideration of the
earnings, dealers said.
   Elsewhere, Burmah Oil gained 16 pence to 635 pence, as
traders said the stock has lately been oversold. Market
makers also reported difficulty in purchasing the shares to
meet fresh buy commitments, pushing the price higher.
   Ranks Hovis McDougall rose 6 pence to 371 pence amid
hearty volume of 1.1 million shares. Dealers said talk
circulated that the Agnelli family of Italy was negotiating
to buy the 29.9% stake held in the U.K. food maker from
Sunningdale Holdings Ltd., a consortium that includes Sir
James Goldsmith.
   Banks were out of favor, dealers said, as a clutch of
downgrades continued to hit the market ahead of the sector's
interim earnings this month. Barclays dropped 7 pence to 398
pence, Lloyds lost 10 pence to 289 pence, Midland shed 9
pence to 300 pence, while National Westminster fell a penny
to 349 pence.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 296.34 points to
32668.11. Market sentiment wasn't enthusiastic, however, with
mostly professional participation dominating activity.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 8.10 points to
close the morning session at 32676.21.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
450 million shares, up slightly from 427 million shares on
Wednesday. Advancers outpaced decliners 622 to 320, while 181
issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section rose 21.56 points, or 0.91%, to 2399.97.
   The second section index rose 19.87 points, or 0.49%, to
4105.99. Volume was estimated at 26.68 million shares, down
from 29.78 million shares.
   Traders said impressions that U.S. economic data disclosed
Wednesday will come to reflect better conditions for Japanese
equities in the intermediate term carried the market higher
yesterday.
   Dealers bought the market higher in the early session,
with profit-taking continually checking gains, traders said.
But in the afternoon, a spark of index-related buying gave
the Nikkei Index an additional boost.
   Further support from buying on speculative issues and some
institutional buying helped prices maintain gains despite the
constant selling pressure, traders said.
   Unexpectedly low U.S. retail sales for May, down 0.7%,
marked the first time that there have been three consecutive
negative monthly sales figures since September-November 1981,
during the most recent U.S. recession.
   "The fact that retail sales have fallen for the third
month in a row means that the {U.S. Federal Reserve} may be
getting nervous about a recession, and could eventually ease
up on credit" policy, noted Kevin Haag, a trader in overseas
operations at Nomura Securities Co.
   The promising outlook invited a handful of institutional
investors to pick up bargain buys for long-term portfolios,
observers said.
   Many electrical shares were attractive, after repeated
rounds of profit-taking have blunted prices, traders said.
But much of the buying was done by dealers, dipping in to
short-term opportunities on speculative issues and market
news-linked shares.
   A story that Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry raised its prediction for private electrical power
consumption through the year 2000 "was a good excuse for
short-term range trading," one trader said, as the electrical
power sector benefited from the interest.
   Kansai Electric closed at 3660 yen ($23.66), up 130 yen.
Tokyo Electric Power rose 100 yen to 4630 yen.
   Talk that Nippon Columbia will market a new, high-grade
compact disk player gave the stock a healthy amount of
interest. The stock rose 70 yen to 1490 yen.
   In addition, talk that certain electronics companies
intend to raise their earnings forecasts encouraged
speculative interest.
   Akai rose 40 yen to 1100 yen, while Hirose added 50 yen to
6830 yen.
   Meanwhile, shares closed higher in Wellington and Manila,
mixed in Hong Kong, and lower in Sydney, Taipei, Singapore
and Seoul.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Paris, Milan and Brussels,
lower in Stockholm and Madrid, and mixed in Zurich and
Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed sharply lower.

   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan told Congress that he would expect a "significant"
drop in interest rates if the administration and Congress
agree on large deficit-reduction package.
   Mr. Greenspan's comments came just four days after the
chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers,
Michael Boskin, said it would be "irresponsible" for the Fed
not to cut rates in the wake of a budget deal. Administration
officials have worried recently that Mr. Greenspan might be
unwilling, even after a budget deal is reached, to cut
interest rates far enough or fast enough to prevent economic
problems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In testimony to the House Banking Committee, the Fed
chairman carefully avoided promising any action by the
central bank. Rather, he argued a "credible" budget deal
would have a direct effect on the financial markets. "There
would be a significant effect on long-term interest rates,"
he said, "and through arbitrage this will affect the short
end of the markets as well."
   He stressed that the budget deal must be "credible,"
saying: "If it's merely bookkeeping measures, I think the
market will yawn -- appropriately."

   Health:
   Hospitals Now
   Can Sue States
   Over Medicaid

SUPREME COURT (SUP)

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that hospitals and
nursing homes may sue state officials under federal law to
force them to provide adequate reimbursement for Medicaid
services, a decision that will drive up federal and state
spending on health care for the poor.
   The 5-4 opinion, written by Justice William Brennan, is
certain to force many states to boost their payments to
hospitals and nursing-home services under the joint
state-federal Medicaid program. The ruling, in a case brought
by the Virginia Hospital Association, comes at a time when
hospitals around the country are complaining that states,
fighting to curb rising health costs, have set reimbursement
rates so low that providers lose money on Medicaid patients.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The decision is certainly good news for hospitals," said
Walter Dellinger, the Duke Law School professor who argued
the case for the hospital association. But he also asserted
that the decision "should greatly benefit the poor," who have
"experienced increasing difficulty in obtaining access to
medical care" in the face of Medicaid funding limits.
   Laurens Sartoris, president of the Virginia Hospital
Association, said that current reimbursement rates cover only
71% of the cost of care his members provide under Medicaid.
To cover the loss, he said many hospitals try to boost the
rates they charge private patients whose bills generally are
paid by corporate health plans. The decision will help
business by reducing the need for such cost-shifting, he
said.
   But the decision will make it harder for government, both
federal and state, to hold down Medicaid spending. Washington
currently spends about $40 billion a year on Medicaid, while
states, which share the costs, spend about $30 billion. The
program helps two groups -- women and children and elderly
nursing-home patients.
   In its brief to the court, the Bush administration warned
that a ruling in favor of the Virginia hospitals "would
vastly increase the cost of the Medicaid program to the
detriment of both state and federal governments." The federal
government pays more than half of the cost of the 25-year-old
Medicaid program and sets broad coverage requirements, but
the states set their own reimbursement rates.
   The legal question in the case focused on the meaning of a
1980 federal law that requires states to certify that their
Medicaid reimbursement rates are "reasonable and adequate"
for efficient medical care.
   The 1980 law doesn't expressly say that it may be enforced
through private lawsuits by Medicaid providers. But the high
court ruled that the 1980 law gives Medicaid health-care
providers a right to sue state officials under a
Reconstruction-era civil rights law to force them to adopt
reasonable reimbursement plans.
   The ruling affirmed the decision of a federal appeals
court in Richmond, Va. The court's decision will give
providers the right to seek higher rates in the future, but
it doesn't allow them to seek repayment for past losses. The
Virginia Hospital Association has won the right to sue, but
it still must prove that the state's reimbursements are too
low. The trial on the merits of the association's case is
scheduled to start Dec. 17.
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist dissented, joined by
Justices Sandra O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy.
The dissenters said the majority disregarded the language of
the 1980 amendment, as well as the intent of Congress to give
states more flexibility in setting up reimbursement plans.
   The ability to sue "isn't going to mean any automatic
windfall" for hospitals, said John Goetz, vice president and
supervisor of health-care ratings at Moody's Investors
Service Inc., because litigation and rate adjustments could
take a long time. Urban hospitals will benefit the most from
changes. At a hospital with a top credit rating, Medicaid
reimbursement accounts for about 8% of revenue. But some
inner-city institutions serving particularly poor areas,
depend on Medicaid for well over half their revenue, he said.
   Hospitals in several states, including Michigan and
Pennsylvania, have already won federal district court
decisions requiring new reimbursement rates.
   Yesterday's high court decision "should give pause to many
state agencies who are looking at ways of modifying their
payment systems to underpay the hospitals," said Kenneth E.
Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association.
   Mr. Raske suggested that instead of reducing
reimbursement, Medicaid agencies develop cost-control
strategies, such as incentives to encourage Medicaid
beneficiaries to use health maintenance organizations.

   House Committee Completes Farm Bill,
   Adopts New Policy on Soil Conservation

   WASHINGTON -- The House Agriculture Committee, working
into the wee hours yesterday, wrapped up a $55 billion,
five-year farm bill after resolving a knot of contentious
environmental issues.
   The lawmakers adopted a new soil- and water-conservation
policy for the 1990s, with pledges from leading farm and
environmental groups that they will support on the House
floor key provisions regarding water quality and wetlands
protection.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Following the final voice vote, Chairman Kika de la Garza
(D., Texas) described the legislation as providing "a
reasonable safety net for farm income while recognizing
budget constraints."
   Outlays for milk-price supports are projected to push the
overall five-year cost above the $53 billion spending limit
in the House budget resolution. But committee staffers said
the $55 billion package would still be consistent with the
Senate Budget Committee guidelines, which House lawmakers
expect to follow in the event of a deficit-reduction
agreement between Congress and the White House.
   In the conservation part of the mammoth bill, money would
be paid to farmers for putting highly erodible or
environmentally sensitive land in the nation's Conservation
Reserve, which the lawmakers voted to expand to 45 million
acres from the current authorized level of 40 million.
Currently, 34 million acres of crop and range land are
enrolled in the reserve.
   The committee agreed to clarify and modify controversial
provisions in the so-called swamp-buster law, which limits
the conversion of wetlands to agriculture. Under a compromise
embraced by environmental and farm groups, farmers would be
allowed to drain small wetlands that are of minimal value to
wildlife. In addition, they could drain wetlands that hamper
farming operations, but only if they "mitigated" the losses
by restoring other drained wetlands on their farm to their
natural state.
   At the same time, committee members decided to set up a
voluntary water-quality program under which farmers could
collect incentive payments of up to $5,000 a year for
changing their farming practices to curb contamination of
wells and water courses. They also adopted a plan for
creating a national agricultural wetlands reserve to preserve
prairie "potholes" and other habitats for migratory
waterfowl. Under the plan, the government would purchase
perpetual easements on the wetlands from rural landowners.
   The lawmakers, suppressing a political urge to boost
subsidies, agreed to freeze target prices at current levels
-- wheat at $4 a bushel, corn at $2.75, barley at $2.36 and
oats at $1.45 -- for the next five years. Target prices for
cotton and rice would be frozen at 72.9 cents a pound and
$10.71 per hundred pounds, respectively. Under the farm
program, the government pays farmers subsidies if market
prices fall short of target prices.
   The committee also reauthorized price-support programs for
sugar, peanuts, honey, wool and mohair producers. When the
bill reaches the floor, probably in early July, all of these
programs are expected to come under attack from a growing
group of lawmakers, including Reps. Richard Armey (R., Texas)
and Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who consider them to be
unfair to consumers. The group will also seek limits on
subsidy payments.
   "Too much of the farm budget is going to wealthy corporate
farms, not enough to family farms," Messrs. Armey and Schumer
said in a statement.
   Meanwhile, the Senate Agriculture Committee, after days of
partisan bickering, resumed works on its version of the 1990
farm bill. But Democrats and Republicans still appeared
stalemated over the big-ticket commodity programs,
particularly the issue of loan rates. Caught in the middle is
committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.). He and Indiana
Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican member, thrashed
out a compromise earlier this week, but the Democrats have
balked at embracing it.
   Sen. Lugar has threatened to create political havoc on the
floor if the committee doesn't forswear so-called budget
gimmicks and freeze target prices, loan rates and land-idling
requirements. Yesterday, he gave his colleagues a taste of
what they might expect later by attacking the sugar
price-support program and proposing two amendments -- one
abolishing the program and the other reducing the support
levels. Both were defeated.
   The House bill, meanwhile, would for the first time
establish a marketing-loan program for producers of soybeans
and other oilseed crops, but with the proviso that it
operates at no cost to the government.
   The measure also would increase food-stamp benefits
slightly for the poor, reauthorize several agricultural
export-promotion programs, and earmark $2.5 billion a year in
export-credit guarantees to help "emerging democracies" in
Eastern Europe buy U.S. foodstuffs.
   In addition, the bill would set the current milk-support
price of $10.10 per hundredweight as the floor price for the
next five years. The dairy industry had sought a floor of
$10.60. Under the bill, the support price could be boosted in
response to fluctuations in government-owned surpluses of
dairy products, but in no case could fall below $10.10.

   NEW YORK -- The Soviet Union will begin to mint a new gold
coin in October 1990, its first for distribution to the West
on a large scale since the Moscow Olympic coin in 1980.
   Congress has banned importation of Soviet gold coins since
1985, a ban that was partly due to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. Victor Barron, chairman of Golden Dove
Distribution (International) Ltd. of London, the Soviet
coin's sole distributor, said, "It would be a travesty if
this ban {on the Soviet coin} was not now lifted in the U.S."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The limited-issue coin will feature the word "peace" in
five languages and the symbol of a dove with an olive branch.
The reverse of the coin will be inscribed with the words
"Glasnost," the Soviet policy of openness, "Perestroika," or
restructuring, and "Mikhail Gorbachev," the Soviet president.
The coin will be 99.9% pure gold in one-ounce, half-ounce and
quarter-ounce sizes, denominated at 200, 100 and 50 rubles,
respectively.

   Call for Mr. Baker

<LP>
   From time to time, we have been tempted to think that the
real reason God created the Middle East was so that U.S.
Secretaries of State would learn humility. This mysterious
machinery seems to have taken hold of Secretary of State Jim
Baker Tuesday, when he threatened to withdraw from what is
always called "the Middle East peace process" unless Israel
became more willing to negotiate on his terms. He even gave
out the White House phone number for the Israelis to call, a
diplomatic initiative that so far has resulted in about 8,000
non-Israeli calls to the White House switchboard. White House
operators are now giving callers the number of the State
Department.
   The proximate cause of this latest turn in the world's
longest-running drama is the formation days ago of a new
Israeli government, denounced as a "war cabinet" in various
Arab precincts. In fact, the new Shamir coalition is nothing
more than a resolution to the country's three-month political
crisis. It was born out of a necessity to establish a working
government that can last at least until the next elections in
1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In essence, the Israeli Knesset has simply voted no
confidence in existing peace proposals. On that basis, it was
possible to form a government. That is not good news for
Syria's Mr. Assad or Iraq's Mr. Hussein, who no doubt prefer
a divided government.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's move represents a blunt
appraisal of "peace" proposals being put forth from inside
and outside Israel. As we have said here before, it is not
evident how any of them promises peace so long as there are
no grounds to believe that Yasser Arafat and the leaders of
Iraq, Syria and Libya share that goal.
   Certainly, Israel is insistent on absorbing as many Jews
as the Soviets will allow to emigrate. The immigration has
depressed Palestinian hopes of Israel ultimately having more
Arabs than Jews in its population. But to think of the Soviet
refugees as a threat to the Arab world stretches credibility.
   The claim that the new government will oppose all
plausible chances for peace further stretches credibility.
Why should Israel not want peace? Its constant state of
siege, most recently manifested in a foiled Arab raid aimed
at crowded Tel Aviv beaches, is costly both to the national
consciousness and the Israeli economy.
   The U.S. government displays some discomfort over the
latest turn of events, but in some sense it is off the hook.
Clearly its 1988 guidelines for establishing a dialogue with
the PLO -- which called on the PLO to abjure terrorism --
were unrealistic. Until the recent raid, the Bush
administration was able to pretend not to notice more than 18
attempted terrorist attacks on Israel by groups represented
on the PLO's executive committee. It can no longer ignore the
Arafat double-cross. The experience may provide a dose of
realism.
   We remain convinced that these troubles will continue
until Israel, not to mention its neighbors, supplants
socialism with a free-market economy. People, after all,
whether Israeli or Palestinian, have to work, and the current
economic structure of the region offers sparse incentives.
   Secretary Baker may yet decide that he must reinsert
himself in the middle of Israel's difficulties with its
unfriendly neighbors. It might be the better course if he
made good on his threat to withdraw awhile.

Nasdaq over-the-counter market and by the Big Board's own
members.
   Big Board members say the exchange acted in large part in
reaction to the National Association of Securities Dealers'
impending launch of Nasdaq International on Sept. 1, in which
the automated quotations system will begin trading 400 to 500
stocks -- including some Big Board issues -- after hours.

   And yesterday, the American Stock Exchange, in a
long-expected move, announced that it would "within days"
disclose a major joint venture for trading stocks and options
around the clock. Meanwhile, other electronic trading
networks are expected to unveil trading systems that will
offer low-cost executions for big institutional investors
away from the Big Board.
   In an effort to bring night-time and off-exchange trading
back to New York, the Big Board said it plans to start
after-hours trading of large baskets of stock later this
year; and it plans to start thrice nightly electronic
auctions of individual Big Board stocks in 1991.
   The Big Board has been mulling after-hours trading for at
least two years.
   But the Big Board's stepped-up initiatives for after-hours
trading may be too late to slow erosion of its share of
trading in its own stocks, Wall Street trading executives and
large investors say.
   While the move to cross baskets of stock after the close
was praised by trading executives, big investors said it
isn't clear whether the Big Board can pull customers away
from systems that are already up and running.
   According to one securities executive briefed by the Big
Board, the exchange is panicky about the growth in
off-exchange trading by brokerage firms who are Big Board
members. It wants to effectively force these members to stop
their off-exchange activity.
   But to do this, the Big Board will have to sacrifice the
role of its specialists, the influential traders who have a
monopoly to make markets in individual stocks on the exchange
floor.
   Big Board officials "are saying: `We will provide an
electronic network at low cost because we will ultimately
eliminate the intermediary, the specialist,'" said the
securities executive. "But part of the deal is they will
prohibit off-exchange trading. The risk that the exchange has
been running is that one of the major firms decides to exit
the exchange."
   Right now, the real threat to the Big Board's market share
isn't foreign exchanges, but aggressive off-exchange traders
such as Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities; electronic
trading systems such as Instinet (an electronic order
matching systems owned by Reuters Holdings PLC); and
portfolio trading systems such as Posit and The Crossing
Network. All offer cheap, anonymous trading to investors
looking to cut trading costs.
   Also, there are a host of feisty regional exchanges. And
finally, many of the nation's largest banks are having
serious discussions about trading among themselves. "Everyone
is looking to create alternatives to the New York Stock
Exchange," said a senior executive at one of the country's
largest banks.
   The news about the Big Board's efforts prompted a variety
of announcements about similar efforts from competing
exchanges. The Chicago Board Options Exchange said in "the
near future" it will announce a major after-hours trading
effort. Leo Melamed, head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
said the Merc will have its Globex system running by
November.
   Meanwhile, the Big Board's overall market share continues
to slowly erode. In the first four months of this year, the
Big Board share of trades in its own stocks averaged 67.8%,
compared with 69.7% in the first four months of last year.
The market share of the off-exchange third market expanded to
an average of 7.4% of overall trading in Big Board stocks for
the first four months, compared with 3.1% in the same period
last year.
   "They had too much shrinkage in market share to sit
still," said Junius Peake, chairman of the Peake/Ryerson
Consulting Group Inc. "I think they are worried about the
Midwest stock exchange," and other competitors, he said.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Art From the Heart of Africa

   New York -- They were called "the Parisians of Africa."
One prominent collector of their handiwork proclaimed "every
cup, every pipe, every spoon a work of art." They were the
Mangbetu people of northeastern Zaire and, with the arrival
of the first Europeans a century ago, their name became
synonymous with an elegant style of art based on the human
figure.
   But the anthropomorphic creations that put them on the map
-- knives, harps, pottery and other implements carved to
resemble fashionable men and women -- weren't really a
Mangbetu tradition. And frequently the artists who made them
weren't Mangbetu either.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At least that's the contention of a provocative new show
here at the American Museum of Natural History, "African
Reflections: Art From Northeastern Zaire." The more than 450
objects, the majority collected on the museum's own
Lang-Chapin expedition at the turn of the century and never
before exhibited, would command interest on aesthetic grounds
alone. But in the context created by curators Enid
Schildkrout and Curtis A. Keim they also tell a story -- one
of colonialism, cultural interaction and change.
   The classic "Mangbetu" pieces, many the work of
neighboring peoples but erroneously attributed by early
collectors because those depicted were so unmistakably
Mangbetu, make the curators' case for taking a more regional
view of African art than the standard tribal pigeonholing.
   For a more traditional look at the area, the Metropolitan
Museum offers "Art of Central Africa: Masterpieces From the
Berlin Museum fur Volkerkunde." The 61 selections from the
vast holdings of this anthropological institution, on view
for the first time in the U.S., are contemporaries of the
objects in "African Reflections." Drawn from several
neighboring groups, they help place the Mangbetu-style art in
the African landscape. ("Art of Central Africa" will be here
until Nov. 4; "African Reflections" is up through Jan. 6
before a tour beginning in Washington at the National Museum
of African Art, March 5, 1991-Jan. 14, 1992).
   From the start, the Mangbetu seem to have had a special
fascination for outsiders. German botanist Georg
Schweinfurth, in 1870 the first European to visit their royal
court, did much to create the mystique with his memoir "The
Heart of Africa." Judging by a tableau in the "African
Reflections" show, re-created from one of Schweinfurth's
splendid drawings, it's not hard to see why he was impressed.
   Here sits King Mbunza, a commanding coppery presence,
resplendent from his towering basketry hat with its train of
eagle feathers down to the brass bands sheathing his legs.
Imagine what it must have been like to see -- as Schweinfurth
did -- the monarch in his Great Hall dancing dervish-like
before his 180 wives] But for all his rhapsodizing about
Mangbetu magnificence, Schweinfurth made no mention of any
anthropomorphic art.
   By the time of the expedition by mammologist/photographer
Herbert Lang and ornithologist/artist James Chapin (190915)
it was clearly another story. Everywhere you look in this
sprawling show you see the bound, elongated heads that were
the hallmark of elegance among Mangbetu -- carved into the
ivory necks of harps and horns, adorning ceramic pots and
bark boxes, even European-style pipes. Who made this art --
and why -- is one of the major themes of the exhibition and
its scholarly catalog (272 pages, $45 hard cover, $27.50
paper). Authors Schildkrout and Keim explain that while the
Mangbetu had a rich aesthetic bent, it was expressed
primarily through the striking geometric designs that
decorated everything from arrows to arms. However,
surrounding peoples carved human likenesses -- including
those of their Mangbetu neighbors. European patronage
encouraged the development of the anthropomorphic genre (and
its production by the Mangbetu themselves); chiefs
commissioned pieces to win favor with colonial officials.
   Though nothing might seem more African than these images
of gazelle-eyed women with their halo hairdos (see
accompanying drawing), in a sense they are as much
reflections of the foreign visitors as the two wooden pipes
portraying Lang and Chapin. After all, the Mangbetu were not
curiosities, like the Congo peacock, waiting to be
discovered, but people responsive to the new arrivals. For
instance, Europeans who saw Chief Okondo's Great Hall around
1913 undoubtedly thought he'd continued the architectural
tradition of his predecessor, Mbunza. In reality, the
curators point out, the structure was built only after a
visit by Lang -- who had expressed his disappointment at not
finding the grand edifice described by Schweinfurth.
   Although anthropomorphic art is the focus of "African
Reflections," the show contains plenty of other fascinating
items. In the section on musical instruments, which pulses
with the sound of elephant-hunting songs and signal drums,
you can gaze with impunity at the once-feared double iron
bell (staring into this symbol of chieftancy was said to
cause death). And you can look at, if not listen to, the big
animal-shaped slit drums. When the wind blew through these,
the label explains, the instruments made moaning sounds like
those of the animals they represented.
   Interspersed among the objects are some of Lang's
arresting archival photographs of the Mangbetu, which help
put a human face on the exhibit. There's also a display about
the okapi, the elusive relative of the giraffe that inspired
the Lang-Chapin expedition in the first place. Not only did
the pair succeed in their mission to capture specimens of
this and other rare mammals, they brought back a whopping 54
tons of material for all departments of the museum --
including 4,000 objects from the Mangbetu and neighboring
peoples.
   For the museum's purposes, the collection arrived just in
time. Soon after, as colonial rule took hold in Mangbetuland
and cash crops supplanted art as the preferred trade
currency, the anthropomorphic genre began to die out. By
contrast, artifacts very similar to those in the Metropolitan
Museum's show, particularly the elaborate masks worn at
initiations and funerals, still are in use today.
   Masks are one of the three genres featured in this
selection of Central African art. The others are regalia and
"power figures," sculptures designed to channel spiritual
forces. There are enough examples of each to highlight
regional differences in style, discussed at greater length in
the catalog (87 pages, $16.95). For instance, the three Kuba
masks, lavishly ornamented with cowrie shells, beading and
painted designs, are worlds apart from the Luba specimen, its
characteristic rounded form and smooth finish elegantly
simple.
   Yet for all their differences, the objects here, as well
as those at the Museum of Natural History, have something
more significant in common. "Many people have the idea that
Africans didn't produce art for art's sake," says that show's
curator, Ms. Schildkrout. "I hope visitors will go away
believing that these people cared very much about things
being beautiful."

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The California Air Resources Board,
continuing its campaign to attempt to force auto makers to
improve pollution controls, adopted tighter tailpipe emission
standards for light trucks, vans and certain other large
vehicles.
   Under the new standards, the board said up to 150,000
vehicles a year would be equipped with anti-smog equipment
similar to that on passenger cars. Currently, larger vehicles
don't normally feature some of the more advanced
anti-pollution technology required on passenger cars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The standards will be phased in over the 1995 and 1996
model years. The board said the new standards would reduce
emissions from the targeted vehicles by 26% to 75%, depending
on the model and its size. Vehicles covered by the new
standards range in weight from 3,750 pounds to 14,000 pounds,
and would include ambulances, tow trucks, small motor homes
and oversized pickup trucks.
   The agency estimated that it would cost $61 to $390 a
vehicle to make modifications needed to meet the new
standards.
   Manufacturers of the affected vehicles couldn't be reached
to comment. In general, however, car makers and gasoline
producers have said that the board's pollution goals are
unreachable or economically unfeasible.
   The new standards are in keeping with the board's recent
drive to adopt tough new emission standards. The campaign has
national significance because California is the country's
biggest car market and because many states model pollution
laws on California's.

   RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- Brazil's top debt negotiator said
the government cannot pay all the interest on its foreign
debt this year because of a lack of foreign currency
reserves, a major newspaper reported.
   Chief negotiator Jorio Dauster said Brazil would be able
to pay only about $5 billion of the $15 billion in interest
owed to private foreign banks in 1990 without using up its
foreign reserves, the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil reported.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Everyone knows Brazil doesn't have the kind of money to
pay this interest," the negotiator told the newspaper.
   Brazil hasn't paid interest to private creditors on its
foreign debt since September and now is $5.6 billion in
arrears, although it has kept up interest payments to
European government lenders.
   The suspension of interest payments is intended to keep
Brazil's foreign reserves from falling below $6 billion, the
equivalent of six months of imports. Foreign reserves stand
at about $7 billion, according to the central bank.
   The negotiator said the government first wanted to
negotiate a standby pact with the International Monetary Fund
for a $2 billion bridge loan before resuming talks on back
interest payments.
   An agreement with the IMF is considered crucial to
Brazil's plans to renegotiate its $114 billion foreign debt,
the Third World's largest.

   Sweetens Offer
   To Bondholders

   Thompson Stake Reduced

   DALLAS -- With its rescue by Japanese investors in
jeopardy, debt-mired Southland Corp. said it has sweetened
its proposed exchange offer to bondholders by an estimated
$200 million after weeks of intense negotiations.
   The new proposal, which was greeted with "tentative
optimism," according to one bond analyst, also would sharply
reduce the equity stake to be retained by the Thompson
family, which founded the giant convenience-store chain. More
importantly, if accepted by bondholders, it should enable the
operator of 7-Eleven stores to skirt a bankruptcy-court
filing. The proposal has been approved by Ito-Yokado Co. and
Seven-Eleven Japan Co., which have agreed to buy a 75% stake
in Southland if the company can restructure its $1.8 billion
in publicly traded debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Southland also announced it won't pay $69 million in
interest due in cash today on two of its debt issues, as well
as additional pay-in-kind interest due on another issue, in
an effort to increase liquidity. That leaves it with a 30-day
grace period before it defaults, but with a new offer on the
table, bondholders seemed unperturbed.
   "They've made a significant move from their previous
position," said George Varughese, managing director of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., which has been advising the
bondholders.
   Under the revised exchange offer, bondholders would
receive debt securities totaling about $550 million, bearing
cash interest at rates of 12% to 14% and having maturities of
six to seven years. The original proposal called for
zero-coupon notes, which don't pay interest but increase in
value over time, and maturities of more than 10 years. A
Southland spokesman wouldn't disclose the amount of
zero-coupon notes offered in the original proposal.
   The new proposal also slices up the Southland pie into
significantly different chunks, with bondholders and
preferred shareholders receiving approximately 18.5% of the
common stock, up from about 10% in the initial swap offer.
The equity position of the Thompson family and their capital
partners would be reduced to 6.5% from the 15% they would
have gotten in the first proposal. Part of bondholders'
opposition to the original offer stemmed from the sizable
equity stake retained by the Thompsons, who founded the
company as a chain of ice stores in the 1920s.
   John Gordon of Deltec Securities Corp., who has headed the
steering committee of Southland's security holders, said the
new proposal was the result of "intense discussion in which
we were dealing with questions of how pain will be
distributed." Although some sticking points remain --
principally over apportionment of value -- a final agreement
could be in place by early next week, he added.
   Anticipating such an agreement, Southland and its
prospective Japanese investors have agreed to extend their
stock purchase agreement, which was scheduled to expire
yesterday, to Aug. 15.
   Southland, which owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other
convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went private in a
$4.9 billion leveraged buy-out in late 1987 to avoid a
possible hostile bid by the Belzberg family of Canada. But
increased competition has eroded sales and profit margins,
and made it difficult for the company to service the huge
debt it took on in going private.

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration, in an
effort to reduce the threat of terrorist air attacks,
disclosed plans to order the installation of more-sensitive
airport X-ray machines and metal detectors.
   The agency also is planning to order airlines to make sure
that all bags on flights leaving the U.S. are accompanied by
a passenger. Unaccounted-for bags would be subjected to
additional searches, which may cause occasional added delays.
In addition, the agency is still studying several major
recommendations made by a presidential commission last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, the Transportation Department announced the
creation of the Office of Intelligence and Security. The
office's new director, as part of the transportation
secretary's staff, will oversee the development of aviation
and maritime security policy.
   The department's action was a response to the President's
Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, which
investigated the terrorist downing of Pan American World
Airways Flight 103 in December 1988. In its report last
month, the panel found that the FAA was a "reactive agency"
with inadequate planning for security threats and that the
civil-aviation security needed substantial improvements. Some
of the steps announced by the FAA yesterday were in the works
before the commission report.
   Two congressional members of the seven-member commission,
Sens. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R.,
N.Y.), praised the security changes as good first steps, but
insisted that more improvements were needed. They both
emphasized the commission recommendation that the FAA assign
"federal security managers" to high-risk airports in the U.S.
and abroad. "It certainly should be done," said Sen. D'Amato,
who said Congress would order it if the FAA doesn't act.
   An FAA official, who declined to be named, said the agency
is considering the recommendation "very seriously." He said
the agency also is taking a close look at other commission
recommendations, which ranged from better background checks
for security employees to tighter procedures for air mail and
cargo.
   The FAA official said the agency will issue a proposal
that would essentially require airlines to replace X-ray
equipment made before 1985 with newer equipment that is more
sensitive. The final order would come out by year end. He
said the new X-ray units would cost $25,000 to $40,000 each,
but didn't know how many units would have to be replaced. The
requirement for better metal detectors, which will also be
able to detect plastic weapons, will be made final in the
next few months.
   The presidential commission on Lockerbie had urged the
Transportation Department to appoint an assistant secretary
to handle security. But that would have required
congressional approval because all the department's allotted
jobs at that level are filled, department officials said.
Naming a director of security got around that problem.
Secretary Samuel Skinner appointed Coast Guard Vice Adm.
Clyde Robbins as the first director of the office.

   WASHINGTON -- Senior members of the Bush administration
plan to send their Japanese counterparts a letter aimed at
boosting the stalled talks on the bilateral economic
relationship, administration officials said.
   The letter, which apparently is to be signed by Secretary
of State James Baker, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, Council of Economic Advisers
Chairman Michael Boskin, and a senior Justice Department
official, is expected to be mailed early next week, the same
officials said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The talks, being carried out under the Structural
Impediments Initiative, are stalled on several issues, most
importantly on Japanese spending on infrastructure. The U.S.
seeks a boost in Japanese infrastructure investment to 9% of
gross national product from 6.3% of GNP currently. The
Japanese maintain this would actually be an increase to 10%
from 7.3%, as the U.S. figures don't include investment in
telecommunications and some other investments.
   There also are important differences between U.S. and
Japanese negotiators over penalties for violations of Japan's
antitrust rules, and over how to monitor enactment of the SII
recommendations.
   The present plan is to mail the letter to six Japanese
ministers, the four chief Japanese negotiators in the SII and
the Japanese Fair Trade Commission.

   Orix Corp. said it won the rights to buy 74 A-320 Airbus
Industrie planes that Braniff Inc. had on order and option,
marking the first time a Japanese company will buy aircraft
strictly for lease.
   Attorneys for Tokyo-based Orix, a huge financial-services
concern, said the company won the rights to the planes in an
auction held in federal bankruptcy court in Orlando, Fla.
They said Orix will pay Braniff $62 million, of which Braniff
owes Airbus $14.2 million for past debts. The transaction
covers firm orders for 24 aircraft and options to purchase 50
additional planes, all for delivery by the year 2000. If all
options are exercised, the total purchase price will be well
in excess of $3 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last fall, Braniff filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The auction was
part of the defunct airline's liquidation.
   For the aircraft-leasing industry, the Orix acquisition --
and the prospect of future deals by other Japanese companies
-- could spell more competitive times ahead, say industry
analysts and executives. In recent years, as air travel has
expanded and demand for planes grown, fortunes have soared
for aircraft-leasing companies such as GPA Group Ltd. of
Ireland and Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance
Corp.
   But until now, no major Japanese company has owned planes
for lease, though several Japanese financial institutions
have been major players in other types of aircraft financing.
   "This is a huge step for Orix," said David Gebler,
president of United States Airlease, a unit of Ford Motor
Co.'s U.S. Leasing subsidiary. "This is the next step in a
developing trend, whereby Japanese institutions have seen the
huge financing demand of the airline industry."
   Leasing planes, versus financing them through conventional
borrowing, is popular among some airlines because of tax and
other accounting reasons.
   Neil Mitchell, an attorney for Orix with the New York firm
Breed, Abbott &amp; Morgan, said the company intends to acquire
more aircraft for lease in the future, "to become another
GPA." He said Orix has helped finance some 191 aircraft
acquisitions for airlines around the world, but "they're
using this to make an entry into the operating lease area."
   In its year ended March 31, Orix had net income of $124.6
million, more than double year-earlier net of $52.9 million.
Revenue rose to $2.04 billion from $767.9 million.
   It is unclear whether Orix already has leases lined up for
its planes. Mr. Gebler said he expects Orix to compete in the
lucrative but risky shorter-term lease segment, the market
for leases of five to 10 years and the stronghold of GPA and
International Lease Finance. In that segment, aircraft owners
expect to lease planes to several customers over the life of
the aircraft, compared with the longer-term lease market,
which is less risky but not as profitable.
   Mark Daugherty, an airline analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds, said Orix and other Japanese companies could have
advantages over U.S. leasing competitors because of their
lower cost of capital.
   "They're late coming into the business," he said, "but
they may offer very attractive rates in order to get
started."

   Your Money Matters:
   New Breed of Financial Sharks Feeds on Investor Fears

   When it comes to investment scams, it's fear, not greed,
that gets most people into trouble.
   Take Mary Lou Butler, a 59-year-old Phoenix, Ariz., woman,
who says she was worried about her financial security. "I was
looking for a financial planner who could take the insurance
money -- $130,000 -- I got when my husband died, and invest
it for a monthly income," she says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The "planner" she found was Dwight Edward Depottey, who
said he would put the money into a "low-risk" investment.
Instead, Mr. Depottey used at least part of it for his own
business and personal benefit, says Margaret Ellis, an
investigator with the securities division of the Arizona
Corporation Commission.
   Last month, Mr. Depottey pleaded guilty to one count of
"conspiracy to commit fraudulent schemes" and no-contest to
one count of theft following an indictment charging that he
defrauded dozens of investors. Most of his victims lost
everything they had invested, says Ms. Ellis. Mr. Depottey is
scheduled for sentencing in state superior court in Phoenix
next Tuesday. His attorney, Leonard G. Brown, had no comment.
   State securities regulators and others say a growing
number of crooks are exploiting individuals' worries about
their financial futures to sell bogus investments and
worthless counseling.
   "They're going after people who are saving for retirement
and their kids' education," says Rep. Rick Boucher, who has
introduced a bill calling for stricter regulation of the
financial planning industry. "These aren't people who want to
do high-risk securities," says the Virginia Democrat,
"they're people who have $400 a month they want to put away."
   A poll released yesterday by the International Association
for Financial Planning, a trade group, shows that most
Americans are "overwhelmingly pessimistic" about their
personal finances: 86% said that college costs have risen
beyond the reach of most families, and 66% said there is less
chance for retirees to be self-sufficient in the coming
decade.
   Those are the kinds of worries that lead people to turn to
a financial planner. But instead of legitimate professionals,
many individuals end up putting themselves in the hands of
charlatans.
   "They present all these statistics about what it's going
to cost for education and retirement, then sell you
anything," says Rep. Boucher.
   "Yes, there are certainly frauds out there," says Robert
A. Hewitt, chairman of the IAFP. But "in spite of some of the
sensational headlines, most fraud and abuse was perpetrated
not by financial planners, but by frauds posing as financial
planners."
   Securities regulators say they're noticing an increase in
the number of specifically targeted pitches.
   Gerald Lewis, Florida's comptroller, says he has always
seen plenty of scams that target retirees. But lately, he
says, more and more schemes are tied to college investments.
   "I see ads that say things like, `How to Prepare for Your
Children's Education.' Just because you see an ad like that
doesn't mean something is wrong, but we're seeing evidence
that people are being victimized by those types of comeons,"
Mr. Lewis says.
   Missouri Commissioner of Securities John Perkins says that
law-enforcement people in his state headed off a
college-investment scheme last year when they arrested Robert
J. Recklein, an unregistered financial planner who was later
sentenced to 15 years for securities violations connected
with the sale of phony promissory notes to people who sought
his financial advice.
   When they searched Mr. Recklein's office, regulators found
what they believe is a marketing plan they say he was
intending to use to sell phony college investments. Among
those listed in the plan as "targets" were grandparents of
newborns, who "often give generously," and parents who "have
repaid their own college loans."
   The plan's "strategy" called for "establishing Robert J.
Recklein as a knowledgeable, inventive and dependable
leader," according to the papers found in his office. It
included procedures that any marketing plan might employ,
including participating in radio talk shows, sending mailings
to day-care centers and to senior citizens.
   Mr. Recklein's lawyer, Dale Myers, says that his client's
investments were "nothing more than Ponzi operations," and
that his client could have been sentenced to only two years,
except that "he stole additional money from investors" while
he was out on bail. As for his client's plan to sell college
investments modeled as prepaid tuition plans, he says Mr.
Recklein got the idea from reading about a legitimate program
run by the state of Michigan.
   "Crooks use the same marketing and sales techniques that
the legitimate financial planning professionals use, which is
why they're so camouflaged," says Scott Stapf of the North
American Securities Administrators Association.
   "Crooked planners will work through community
organizations, unions and church groups, and will make
presentations. Afterwards, they get lists of members and move
in with sales pitches," says Mr. Stapf. "It's a very
effective way to set up people, because they trust the
planner, and feel guilty about having gotten the `free
advice.'"
   For example, in Barrington, Ill., radio ads touted a
series of "no-cost, no-obligation financial planning
seminars" to help people plan for and save for retirement.
One script read: ". . . We have never seen people so
bewildered and confused, especially persons who would like to
plan retirement, as well as those already retired. The
horrors of Wall Street, the scary bond market, fluctuating
interest rates, they are all reasons for concern."
   People who attended the classes were then invited to
participate in a personal financial planning consultation,
where many were sold limited partnerships purportedly earning
"guaranteed" annual interest of 10% to 15%. The two men
involved, Earl Dean Gordon and Kenneth F. Boula,
"acknowledged that they participated in conduct that
ultimately involved $5 million in funds obtained from
investors in real estate limited partnerships where
misrepresentations were made to investors," says their
attorney, David Stetler.
   Both pleaded guilty in federal court to mail-fraud
charges, and are scheduled to be sentenced today in U.S.
district court in Chicago.
   Law-enforcement officials and securities regulators say
many people are lulled into thinking fraud can't happen to
them because they aren't the stereotypically "greedy"
investor. But, says Susan Bryant, the Oklahoma commissioner
of securities: "This is not based on (investor) greed, and
that's one of the reasons this is frightening."

   -- Is planner registered to sell investments in your
state, and, if so, what investments?
   -- Does the planner have a record of disciplinary actions
taken by state securities agencies, the Securities and
Exchange Commission or self-regulatory organizations such as
the National Association of Securities Dealers?
   -- Has the planner been sued by clients, and, if so, what
did the complaints allege and what was the outcome?
   -- Has the planner filed for bankruptcy, or been
prosecuted for a money crime?
   -- Does the planner have the educational background and
work history he or she claims?

   Police May Use Checkpoints in Efforts
   To Catch Drunken Drivers, Justices Say

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that police may set
up highway checkpoints in efforts to catch drunken drivers.
   By a 6-3 vote, the high court said checkpoints in which
police stop every car don't violate the Fourth Amendment's
protection against "unreasonable searches and seizures." In
an opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the
court upheld a checkpoint set up in 1986 by the Michigan
State Police.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Use of checkpoints by state and local police has become
widespread in recent years as public attention on drunken
driving has heightened. Alcohol played a part in more than
23,000 traffic deaths in 1988 of a total of 47,000 traffic
fatalities, according to Transportation Department
statistics.
   Estimates of checkpoint use vary. The National Commission
Against Drunk Driving, a private group, said several years
ago that police have used checkpoints in all 50 states and
the District of Columbia. But some state and federal
officials say the number of states using the checkpoints is
lower. A 1985 survey by Michigan officials found 36 states
using checkpoints. Thirty-one states filed a
friend-of-the-court brief in support of Michigan in the high
court.
   The high court said that stopping a car at a checkpoint
falls within the legal definition of a "seizure," triggering
the protection of the Fourth Amendment. But the court
concluded that such a seizure isn't "unreasonable" for three
reasons: The states have a strong interest in curbing drunken
driving; checkpoints help achieve that aim, and the intrusion
on motorists is "slight."
   The ruling is the culmination of a decade of legal
uncertainty created by an earlier high court ruling. In 1979,
the justices struck down a Delaware system of establishing
checkpoints and randomly selecting cars to be checked. The
court said random selection gave police officers too much
discretion without standards for exercising their authority.
"Questioning of all oncoming traffic at roadblock-type stops
is one possible alternative," the court suggested as an aside
in 1979.
   Since then, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
which hailed yesterday's decision, courts in 21 states have
upheld checkpoints while judges in 12 others have struck them
down. In Michigan, a state appeals court ruled that the
checkpoint, which was used on only one night, violated the
Fourth Amendment.
   Yesterday's ruling should eliminate any uncertainty,
although in some states the checkpoints may still violate
privacy guarantees in state constitutions that are broader
than the Fourth Amendment.
   Justice John Stevens dissented, joined by Justices William
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall. Challenging the majority's
conclusions, the dissenters said there isn't any evidence to
demonstrate that checkpoints are more effective than using
the same police manpower for traffic patrols.
   And in an unusual and pointed reference to totalitarian
governments, the dissenters said: "Unannounced investigatory
seizures are, particularly when they take place at night, the
hallmark of regimes far different from ours." They also said
that alcohol use has been declining as a cause of traffic
fatalities for the past six years. (Michigan State Police
Department vs. Sitz)
                                                                                                       

   Discounts for Wholesalers
                                                                                                       

   The justices gave manufacturers more flexibility to charge
lower prices to wholesale distributors than to retailers in
the same market, as long as the discount is reasonably based
on services provided by the wholesalers.
   But while establishing this flexibility, the justices
upheld a $1,349,700 jury verdict against Texaco Inc. for
illegal price discrimination against a dozen retail gasoline
dealers in the Spokane, Wash., area. In an opinion written by
Justice Stevens, the high court said the evidence showed that
Texaco's discounts to two wholesalers in Spokane weren't
related to any services performed by the companies.
   The vote was 9-0 to uphold the verdict against Texaco and
6-3 to allow manufacturers to offer so-called reasonable
"functional discounts" to wholesalers but to deny them to
retailers.
   Functional discounts are price reductions offered
generally to wholesalers for services they provide to
retailers that the manufacturer might otherwise have to
provide directly.
   The Robinson-Patman Act, added by Congress to federal
antitrust law in 1936, generally makes it illegal to
discriminate in prices charged to different purchasers when
the effect is to reduce competition. However, the court
recognized that some functional discounts, although a form of
price discrimination, don't violate federal law.
   Peter Fishbein, a New York lawyer who represented Texaco
in the high court, said the decision "is very significant"
and "makes it possible for suppliers to have dual
distribution systems of wholesalers and retailers and to
charge different prices to each." The ruling could affect a
range of manufacturing and production industries, from
gasoline and oil to auto parts.
   In the Texaco case, the jury found in 1985, and a federal
appeals court in San Francisco agreed in 1988, that Texaco
violated federal law by giving a discount on gasoline to two
Spokane-area wholesalers. The wholesalers had a dual role,
distributing the gasoline to retailers and selling some of it
through their own retail outlets that competed directly with
independent Texaco retailers. The jury found that Texaco
discriminated because the wholesalers' retail outlets
received the discount while other retailers didn't.
   The jury awarded the retail dealers $449,900, which was
tripled under federal law to $1,349,700.
   Justice Byron White, in one separate opinion, and Justice
Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy, in another
opinion, disagreed with the court's exception to the law for
"reasonable functional discounts." (Texaco Inc. vs.
Hasbrouck)
                                                                                                       

   Clean Air Plans
                                                                                                       

   The justices ruled that the Environmental Protection
Agency's failure to review a state's proposed changes in a
clean-air plan within a four-month deadline doesn't mean the
changes automatically take effect and the old standards can
no longer be enforced.
   The ruling is a defeat for General Motors Corp., which was
sued by the EPA in 1987 for failing to comply with
Massachusetts clean-air standards adopted in 1980.
Massachusetts had already proposed changes in its plan that
gave GM more time to comply.
   The Clean Air Act says the EPA should approve or reject
plan changes within four months. A federal judge dismissed
the EPA's lawsuit, ruling that the four months had lapsed,
that the plan changes were already in effect, and that the
EPA could no longer enforce the old standards. A federal
appeals court in Boston reversed the decision and said the
expiration of the four-month limit didn't bar the EPA from
enforcing the old standards.
   In an opinion written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the high
court affirmed the appeals court ruling in favor of the EPA.
But the impact may be short-lived if Congress agrees on a new
Clean Air Act. (General Motors Corp. vs. U.S.)

   GAO Says Cable-TV Rates
   Increased 10% in 1989

   WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office found that
monthly cable-television rates rose 10% in 1989, roughly
double the pace of inflation -- a finding that is certain to
strengthen lawmakers' resolve to pass legislation
re-regulating cable.
   The study is a companion to a survey a year ago that
showed a 29% increase in the average cable subscriber's
monthly fees for the lowest-priced service between December
1986 and October 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The GAO, Congress's auditing arm, said that monthly fees
for both the lowest-priced service and the most popular basic
service increased an average of 10%, while cable operators
added only one or two channels. The consumer price index for
the year rose about 5%. The average cost of the lowest-priced
cable service rose to $15.95 for 31 channels from $14.50 for
30 channels, and the most popular basic service rose to
$16.33 for 34 channels from $14.91 for 32 channels, the GAO
said. The study also showed a 5% increase in revenue per
subscriber in 1989.
   The study was prepared for the House Telecommunications
and Finance Subcommittee, which plans to vote on cable
re-regulation legislation this month.
   The National Cable Television Association said the GAO
report "reconfirms that the average cable subscriber's
monthly bill increased at about the rate of inflation in
1989, and is still further evidence that cable rate increases
have leveled off."

   Marx once wrote that history occurs twice, first as
tragedy then as farce. Maybe he had the flag-burning debate
in mind.
   Five Supreme Court justices made this city's day on Monday
by striking down Congress's flag-desecration law. In striking
down a similar Texas law (also by 5-4) last year, the court
had caught everyone by surprise. This time everyone had lines
memorized, moves choreographed. "L.A. Law" should be this
entertaining.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   George Bush headed for the Rose Garden to say that
flag-burning "endangered the fabric of our country," no pun
intended. He accepted a replica of the Iwo Jima Memorial and
plugged his constitutional amendment to protect the flag.
Yesterday (Flag Day, of course) he popped over to the Vietnam
Memorial for reveille. The only missing prop was Mike Dukakis
to debate the pledge of allegiance.
   Bob Dole was even more inventive, departing the White
House waving a miniature flag with his left hand. The Senate
minority leader had everyone laughing with a vow to use a
flag-amendment vote against opponents in "a 30-second TV
spot." He wasn't kidding. By Flag Day, he'd assembled a dozen
senators along with the Amvets, disabled vets, you-name-it
vets for a flag-waving gala on the Capitol lawn. Jaunty and
back-slapping, he looked like he hadn't had this much fun
since the 1988 Iowa primary.
   All of this drove opponents to sputtering fury. "Cheap
politics]" cried Ron Brown, the Democratic Party chairman,
suddenly shocked-shocked] -- to find demagoguery in
Washington. Pat Schroeder, the Colorado constitutionalist,
was beside herself when her House subcommittee failed to kill
a flag-desecration amendment. She called it a GOP "reprieve
from the S&amp;L crisis, the deficit crisis, the
education-environment or any other crisis we're in."
   On a roll, she moved right past Tailgunner Joe to the Big
Bertha of scare-metaphors, the Fuhrer. "One of the first
things Hitler did was make flag burning a crime in Nazi
Germany," Ms. Schroeder declared, though of course what
Hitler really did was change his country's flag. Tom Wolfe
once observed that the left constantly worries that the long
night of fascism is about to descend in America, though the
only place it ever seems to land is Europe.
   Even more creatively, Ohio Democrat James Traficant, the
House's stand-up comic, said that while he hated flag-burning
he hated even more that the burning flags are made in Japan
and Korea.
   A year ago I opposed the flag amendment, on grounds that
conservatives should be conservative about amending the
Constitution. Liberals are more creative amenders, after all.
But after watching this week's spectacle, I now think I was
as stuffy as James J. Kilpatrick. Anything that creates such
uproar among Washington's elites must have something going
for it. Consider some of the benefits:
   First, a friend points out, a flag amendment will restore
dignity to flag-burners. What honor is there in protest if
you can't shock the bourgeoisie by breaking its laws? An
amendment will make flags worth burning again.
   Second, the flag debate will deflect the demagoguery that
will soon surround Mr. Bush's veto of the civil-rights
(racial quotas) bill. Democrats are maneuvering for a veto
during the visit by South African hero Nelson Mandela later
this month. One cheap political shot deserves another.
   Third, and more seriously, a good constitutional brawl can
contribute now and then to a healthy democracy. As every
political scientist knows, the Supreme Court is protected
from, but also sensitive to, public opinion. Every so often
the Justices have shown they need a populist tonic to remind
them who's boss.
   This is especially true on the First Amendment, which even
this supposedly "conservative" Supreme Court has turned into
a cudgel to beat community standards. The First Amendment
protects "speech," especially the political speech essential
to self-government. But by now virtually any act or
"expression" (not merely speech) that can be given the least
artistic or political tinge is said to be outside the
judgment of any community.
   It's no accident that the creator of the raunchy rap album
banned in Miami, "As Nasty As They Wanna Be," thinks the flag
decision is a harbinger of his case. This is, after all, the
same court that last year said Pittsburgh couldn't put a
Christmas creche in a public place unless it also put up
"secular" symbols (Frosty the Snowman).
   The great legal scholar and civil libertarian, Alexander
Bickel, once wrote that, "we do need, individually and as a
society, some values, some belief in the foundations of our
conduct, in order to make life bearable." In that context he
also wrote, "Freedom of speech, with us, is a compromise, an
accommodation." If a community decides its foundations
include not burning the flag, the compromise hardly means
book burning is around the corner.
   The flag-amendment is a rebuke, admittedly crude, to
justices who overturned 48 state laws -- and now a national
law -- codifying community respect for a national symbol. It
says to the court, on this one you've gone too far. It says:
Some "rights" violate the nation's -- the community's --
democratic right to codify common values in law. If a little
flag-waving goes along for the ride, remember who picked this
fight.

   Gold prices collapsed again, but central banks swooped
into the market with big buy orders and halted the decline.
   More Saudi Arabian sales prompted the initial drop in
London to around $340 an ounce from $351 the previous day. It
was Saudi sales that triggered two previous sharp sell-offs
this spring, including a $29-an-ounce plunge March 26.

   But with central banks' extensive purchases of gold
bullion reassuring the market, prices recouped some of their
losses yesterday. The London afternoon gold price was fixed
at $345.85, still its lowest since July 1986.
   In New York, the soon-to-expire June gold contract ended
$5.20 an ounce lower at $346.80, only moderately above its
day's low of $346.00. August gold, the most active contract,
recovered from its low of $348.20 to end with a loss of $5.30
at $349.80.
   The impact of the Saudi sales and prospects of sales by
the Soviet Union to raise hard currency have sent a wave of
pessimism through commodity markets generally, causing prices
to fall. One analyst, observing that the opening up of
Eastern Europe initially was viewed as stimulating demand for
commodities, said, "That may be true for the long term, but
now they're having a credit crunch."
   One reason central banks intervened to support gold
yesterday may have been to relieve pressure on the Soviet
Union and South Africa, the world's biggest producers, said
Edwin Arnold, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch in London.
   Both nations are undergoing major political adjustments
and can't afford a big price drop in one of their biggest
export products, he said. If gold plummeted, many high-cost
South African mines might be forced to close prematurely.
Moreover, both nations have deposited gold from their
monetary reserves as collateral for loans, according to Mr.
Arnold.
   Because the credit was granted when gold was
higher-priced, this spring's slump has reduced the value of
the collateral and could discourage lenders from making
additional loans under the old terms, he said.
   Another reason for the central banks' interest is simply
that they own a lot of gold. The Bank for International
Settlements says that since the end of last year, the value
of central banks' gold holdings has fallen by about $52
billion as the price has dropped.
   Gold initially slumped yesterday when the National
Commercial Bank of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, placed an order to
sell about 15 metric tons of the metal, London and Swiss
dealers said. A metric ton of gold is equal to 32,150 troy
ounces.
   The disposal followed two large sales attributed to the
Saudi bank in March and May, which dealers said played a
major part in driving the London bullion price down more than
11% in the past 2 1/2 months.
   The Saudi Arabian bank also has been creating frequent
consternation in the market by actively selling and buying
back gold, London bullion dealers said. Estimates of its
sales over the past 2 1/2 months range from 100 to 200 metric
tons.
   Now that central banks have entered the market, bullion
dealers said, the reaction to any further Middle Eastern
sales probably will be more muted. They also said the amount
of gold sold yesterday was much smaller than on the previous
two occasions.
   Dealers wouldn't identify the central banks involved, but
the Bank of England is known to enter the market from time to
time to prevent major price fluctuations, and central banks
in general are becoming more active in the market, dealers
say. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that
they sold 185 metric tons of bullion last year after buying
246 tons in 1988. Last year, Belgium, Mexico and Canada
reduced their monetary gold holdings, while Spain increased
its own.
   Gregory Klochkoff, a vice president of Bank of Boston in
Providence, R.I., said strength in the long-term bond market
and in the stock market has drawn traders' funds away from
precious metals lately. Bond traders said intermediate-term
bonds also have been strong, with a negative effect on gold.
   Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank,
New York, said gold is caught between the pressure of Middle
Eastern selling and what he called a "cap" on the market --
the fear that any strong price advance would induce the
Soviets to start selling.
   "The Saudis have found a soft spot on the market, and
they're pushing it to their advantage," he said. "They are
continuing to push sales, and this is drawing other sellers
into the market."
   One reason they may be doing it is to buy back the gold
later at a lower price, he said.
   However, despite the overwhelming bearishness of the
market at the moment, gold's fundamentals are the best
they've been in four years, according to Mr. Mehta.
   "When this heavy selling abates, the market could snap
back rather smartly," he said -- although the fear of Soviet
selling continues to hang over the market.
   Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals
Advisors in Toronto, pointed out that the latest sales
attributed to the Saudi bank weren't large.
   However, he said, "this market is so spooked and paranoid
about further sales from the Middle East that even the
slightest sign of selling from that direction causes buying
to dry up and makes the market become vulnerable to large
price moves on small volume."
   Mr. Nichols agreed that gold could rebound if the pressure
is lifted, and he said he doesn't see Soviet selling as a big
problem.
   "The Soviet Union needs to husband its reserves for the
collateralization of bank credits and to eventually support a
freely tradable currency," he said.
   He also said that although the Soviets have sold gold,
they've also been buying it in the forward market for future
delivery, so weakness in gold can't really be attributed to
Moscow.
   Silver for July delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New
York fell 14.8 cents an ounce to $4.7850. July platinum ended
with a loss of $4.70 an ounce at $476.50 after recovering
from a low of $471.50.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude and heating oil futures prices took a tumble
on the New York Mercantile Exchange in some cases wiping out
more than half of this week's gains. Traders found it
difficult to account for the drop, but some said a major
market participant began selling aggressively halfway through
the session. Nymex crude for July delivery finished at $17.13
a barrel. The August contract lost 35 cents a barrel, and
later months were mixed. Heating oil was pulled lower by
crude's decline. Gasoline continued its strong showing,
primarily on reports of a problem at an Exxon Corp. refinery
in Louisiana and continued strong demand on the U.S. West
Coast. Unleaded gasoline for July delivery rose 1.27 cents a
gallon to end at 60.12 cents.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of pork belly and live hog
futures for July delivery fell their daily limits of two
cents a pound and 1.5 cents a pound, respectively, on growing
concern that demand for pork is dropping. Retail pork prices
are near record highs, analysts said, while wholesale beef
prices are declining. "There's a feeling that there's some
shifting going on by retailers, featuring less pork and more
beef and chicken," said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. In addition, Mr.
Morgan said, the aggregate wholesale meat price for pork has
declined on each of the past five business days, reflecting
reduced demand for pork. Pork belly futures for July delivery
settled at 68.45 cents a pound yesterday, while the July live
hog contract finished at 60.80 cents a pound.
                                                                                                       

   COFFEE: Futures prices fell on a government report that
projected higher world production. The July delivery declined
4.65 cents a pound to 87.10 cents. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture, in an estimate of the 1990-91 world crop for the
season beginning Oct. 1, said global output of coffee would
amount to 101.7 million bags of 132 pounds each, compared
with 92.6 million bags in the current season. The report
placed Brazilian output for the 1990-91 season at 33 million
bags, compared with 26 million in the current season.
According to Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., New York, the recent strength in coffee has been based
on the belief that supplies of higher-quality coffee would be
tight in the coming season. These producers' inventories have
been sharply drawn down by record shipments during a year of
free market trading, she said. "Now, it appears that these
countries will have more coffee than had been expected next
season, and with the prospect that the market will remain
without quotas, heavy sales could drive down prices," Ms.
Kaul said.

   Management:
   Firms Toss Around Big Signing Bonuses
   To Coax Executives to Change Loyalties

   The corporate big leagues are using the same lure as pro
sports teams to woo promising stars: hefty signing bonuses.
   The $9 million guaranteed to Gerald Greenwald, who left
Chrysler Corp. as vice chairman last month to head a proposed
employee buy-out of UAL Corp., is the latest in lucrative
front-end pledges made to corporate heavy hitters who switch
teams.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To win senior executives tied to their employers through
bigger stock-option and other long-term golden handcuffs,
suitors are finding it takes quite a golden key. "Most people
at the senior management level . . . are expecting to be
bought out," says Michael Halloran, head of the executive
compensation practice at consultants Towers Perrin, who calls
such bonuses "the golden hello."
   Moreover, initial bonuses are no longer just for those at
the very top. As long-term compensation plans edge farther
down the corporate ladder, so also do recruitment bonuses.
"Sign-on bonuses are the counterattack to long-term
compensation plans," says Barbara Provus, a principal with
Sweeney Shepherd, recruiters in Chicago.
   Signing bonuses aren't exactly new. Chrysler wooed and won
Lee Iacocca more than a decade ago with a deal that included
a $1.5 million front-end payment. But bonuses clearly are
becoming more prevalent. Gerard Roche, chairman of Heidrick &amp;
Struggles recruiters in Chicago, says 60% of his top-level
searches involve a signing bonus these days. A search he just
completed included a $1.5 million bonus to the candidate.
   Companies that offer signing bonuses run the risk of
creating dissension among managers who don't receive such
enticements. Even so, more companies believe such payments
are necessary at least partly to insulate executives from
risk. Mr. Greenwald is joining an employee buy-out that
hasn't happened yet -- and maybe never will. When Richard
Miller joined troubled Wang Laboratories Inc. as president
and chief executive officer last year, the company guaranteed
three years' salary and bonus totaling $1 million a year --
more than double that of his predecessor. He also received
stock options for two million Wang shares, a company
spokeswoman says.
   But specialists say bonuses are structured mainly to
compensate executives for what they leave behind. Mr.
Miller's guarantee at Wang was relatively modest compared
with that of other executives coming into such circumstances,
one compensation consultant says. But Mr. Miller had left
General Electric Co. earlier when the unit he headed was
traded away, and thus had no big-company benefits as
bargaining leverage. Mr. Miller couldn't be reached for
comment.
   More often, a company pays heavily to get a senior
executive. When RJR Nabisco Inc. hired Louis V. Gerstner as
chief executive last year, it gave him $14.6 million up front
to compensate for "accrued and expected" benefits he lost by
leaving the presidency of American Express Co., according to
RJR proxy statements. RJR also agreed to pay Mr. Gerstner
$446,374 a year in retirement benefits.
   "There are so many things to buy out these days," says
Alan Johnson, managing director, compensation, for recruiters
Handy Associates in New York. In 1985, salary made up 45% of
a chief executive's compensation; last year, it was 39% and
dropping. The remainder comes from bonuses, stock benefits
and performance plans. There are also supplemental executive
retirement programs, health plans, cars and country club
memberships to consider.
   Mr. Greenwald, who at Chrysler was in line to succeed Lee
Iacocca as chief executive, says at United he wanted "a
compensation package that would not cause me to look back. It
is a best effort at creating a compensation package that
would represent my expectations over the next five years at
Chrysler."
   Mr. Greenwald had made a great deal of money at Chrysler
in the past -- including $11.6 million from exercising stock
options in 1985, 1986 and 1987 -- but there was no guarantee
he would do so again. According to Chrysler proxies, all the
stock options issued to him since 1986 were valueless when he
left Chrysler because of the company's falling stock price.
   However, Mr. Greenwald says it isn't valid to calculate
the options in relation to current stock values because most
of them run for 10 years and no one can say what the stock
will be worth in the future.
   Mr. Greenwald's package at United includes a $5 million
bonus for signing on with the buy-out group, according to
people familiar with his compensation. He will receive an
additional $4 million fee if the buy-out isn't completed; if
it is completed, his salary and other compensation will total
over $12 million in five years.
   Increasingly, recruiters find that stars even further down
in a company are demanding to be bought out. "You can't
recruit people at any level of the organization if you can't
keep them whole," says Robert Salwen, a principal with
William M. Mercer Inc., consultants in New York.
   Mr. Greenwald himself says he had to pay bonuses to
recruit subordinates at Chrysler. "You can't attract
outsiders and say, `By the way, we expect you to take a cut
from whatever you were paid,'" he says. "That just doesn't
make common sense."
   Ms. Provus from Sweeney Shepherd recently found someone to
fill a $200,000-a-year general counsel position. "The
individual was walking away from several long-term incentive
plans, involving stock and cash. The only way we could get
him {was} to figure out the value, and put that on the
table."
   The same applies even to much lower-paid positions, she
says. At a company such as Digital Equipment Corp., she says,
which has a generous stock program "even if the person is
only at $70,000 or $80,000 {in salary}, he or she might have
a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of stock they own
that's not vested. That's a summer home or a college
education. That's expensive for middle management to walk
away from." A Digital spokesman says such valuable stock
holdings for middle managers were more likely several years
back when the company's stock was trading at more than double
today's level.
   Even at entry levels, more companies are mimicking law
firms and consulting firms, which long have offered signing
bonuses to attract new candidates. In a recent William M.
Mercer survey, 60% of hospitals said they either used bonuses
or planned to begin doing so. Mark Edwards, a principal at
consultants Sibson &amp; Co., Princeton, N.J., says typical
sign-on bonuses for electrical engineers or programmers who
are in high demand might range from $2,000 to $15,000.
   One motivation for using a bonus, rather than higher
salaries, is to avoid disrupting the rest of the
organization. "Sometimes you have someone who doesn't fit
into a salary level," says Jose Berrios, personnel director
at the media company Gannett Co. "If you go out and bring in
a person at a higher level . . . that really sets up an
equity problem," he says, noting that the company uses such
bonuses on "a case-by-case basis."
   Recruiter Paul R. Ray Jr., president of Paul R. Ray Inc.,
Fort Worth, Texas, cites a candidate courted by a client
company. Because the manager was already making as much as
the highest-paid person at his level in the new company, it
offered an upfront payment of 25% of his first-year
compensation and promised gradual salary increases for the
future.
   But sometimes, signing bonuses can create dissension.
Union officials at United try to play down Mr. Greenwald's
bonus, contending that talk of it may jeopardize the buy-out.
(United workers are being asked to take pay cuts as part of
the buyout.) At Apple Computer Inc., a $1.5 million signing
bonus for a new chief financial officer helped to fuel
employee discontent earlier this year.
   One compensation consulting company that pays signing
bonuses to attract actuaries, who are in short supply,
declines to discuss the practice because of the risk of
alienating people who weren't offered bonuses. In the end,
however, such big bonuses are governed by the same thing that
governed big salary offers in the past: "Everything has to do
with how much they want the guy," says Mr. Johnson at Handy
Associates. "No one has a manual that says they have to do
it."

   LIMA -- It was supposed to be a close presidential
election. But on Sunday, Alberto Fujimori astounded pollsters
(including myself) by overwhelming rival candidate Mario
Vargas Llosa 57% to 36%, with 7% of the ballots blank or
null. Mr. Fujimori's victory in this runoff election was
brought about by a combination of support from new and old
power blocks in Peru. However, as he begins the difficult
task of putting together a new administration, those who
helped bring him to power seem somewhat reluctant to step
into the fire that he has been elected to put out.
   As a consequence of policy mistakes, mismanagement and
corruption during the administration of outgoing President
Alan Garcia, inflation in Peru has surpassed an accumulated
1,000,000% since 1985, the year Mr. Garcia became president.
Wages and salaries are worth, at present, half of what they
were in 1985. The country is $2 billion in arrears to
multilateral financing agencies, not to mention the
accumulated unpaid debts to other countries, suppliers and
private banks. If possible, many in the international
financing community would just prefer to erase Peru entirely
from the map.

   In the past 30 months, Mr. Vargas Llosa became the paladin
against Mr. Garcia's populist measures: He opposed Mr.
Garcia's failed attempts to nationalize the banks; he unified
the center-right opposition; and he worked out a detailed
government program, including plans to combat inflation
immediately, reinsert Peru into world trade and finance,
privatize state-owned enterprises and re-direct fiscal
expenditures to benefit only those who are in greatest need.
   During the campaign, Mr. Vargas Llosa requested a "clear
mandate" in order to carry out these reforms in a country
partially suspicious of a successful, white and cosmopolitan
candidate. At the peak of his campaign, however, the polls
indicated 40% of the voters in his favor. Still, bearing in
mind the crisis that his main adversaries -- Mr. Garcia's
APRA party and the unpopular left-wing factions -- were
experiencing, his victory seemed imminent. Until a dark horse
appeared.
   Out of public attention -- which focused on a polarization
of the once-leading candidates -- Mr. Fujimori's campaign was
working practically from door to door. Campaign work was
conducted by small and "informal" entrepreneurs and by the
main Christian evangelical groups. One month prior to April's
first-round election, Mr. Garcia realized the potential of
this totally new political face.
   Until then, the relationship between Mr. Garcia and Mr.
Fujimori had been one of mutual sympathy, though of little
importance. Mr. Fujimori had been flirting with the APRA
party since 1980. For instance, he directed a weekly
political program on the state-owned television channel
called Concertando ("seeking agreement"). In this way, he
became better known outside the National Agrarian University,
where he was rector. His decision to run as a presidential
candidate was probably well considered by Mr. Garcia who, at
the time, was mounting an everyone-against-Vargas Llosa
campaign in order to prevent his nemesis from obtaining the
51% he needed to become president in the first round.
   When Mr. Garcia's finely tuned political instincts told
him that Mr. Fujimori could become a front-runner, the
president rejected his own party's candidate and supported
Mr. Fujimori behind APRA's back. It is not known whether Mr.
Garcia demanded something in exchange; maybe he acted-as Mr.
Fujimori implicitly has declared -- just for the pleasure of
humiliating Mr. Vargas Llosa.
   The outcome of the first round placed Mr. Fujimori at the
threshold of the presidency. Mr. Vargas Llosa's campaign had
become so polarized against APRA and the left, that it was
reasonable to suppose that these forces would combine their
accumulated 28% with Mr. Fujimori's 24%, in order to surpass
Mr. Vargas Llosa's 28% in the June runoff. In fact, the final
tally was pretty close to this mark.
   Between the April and June elections, Mr. Fujimori
realized he had to collect a minimal team that could draft a
platform to confront Mr. Vargas Llosa's full brigade of
specialists. One of those to whom he turned was the
world-famous Peruvian economist, and champion of Peru's
underground economy, Hernando de Soto. Mr. de Soto had been
backing Mr. Vargas Llosa-a founding member of Mr. de Soto's
Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD)-until they had a
falling-out two years ago. Mr. Fujimori now asked for the
support of Mr. de Soto, declaring that he was "counting not
only on Mr. de Soto's collaboration, but on the institute's,
as well." Politics makes strange bedfellows indeed.
   In the end, Mr. Fujimori's structure of alliances paid off
well. As the results of the day's voting became clear, Mr.
Vargas Llosa, looking very relaxed, conceded defeat the same
night with charm and good manners. Mr. Fujimori, on the other
hand, looked tense and disorganized as he attempted to call
to order a chaotic news conference (he shows little trust in
his aides). Pressure was beginning to build in a man who
doesn't have a precise agenda, a defined economic team, a
structured political organization, a parliamentary majority,
credibility from the local business community, or sufficient
contacts abroad for attempting to solve the country's worst
crisis in its history.
   The president-elect's first comments were parsimonious and
prudent. He called for a national consensus and announced a
coming trip to the U.S., Europe and, of course, Japan. (It is
conventional wisdom in Lima that because of national pride,
in the year of Emperor Akihito's crowning, Tokyo will not
allow Mr. Fujimori's government to fail.)
   According to sources within the ILD, Mr. de Soto already
was offered and has rejected the job of prime minister. When,
in 1987, Mr. de Soto was backing Mr. Vargas Llosa, he
apparently expected that post. Since then, however, his
institute has gained such enormous international prestige
that he apparently is unwilling to risk tainting the ILD in
the risky game of national politics. Nevertheless, it is
likely he will become a member of Mr. Fujimori's kitchen
cabinet, since he combines well an understanding of the
informal sector -- which supported Mr. Fujimori -- with an
important set of contacts abroad.
   Currently, Lima is crowded with potential counselors. On
Monday, Harvard's "shock treatment" economist, Jeffrey Sachs,
will be coming to town to present a detailed stabilization
program he has designed with a group of young Peruvian
economists led by Carlos Paredes.
   My best guess is that, in two weeks' time, Mr. Fujimori
will go on his worldwide tour with very little decided
regarding his team and program. He will want to hear first
whatever Washington and Tokyo may have to say. On his return,
he will have only another two weeks before his inauguration.
He probably will come up with an heterogeneous team and a
wishful-thinking adjustment program. It would be unfair to
demand that Mr. Fujimori's first bullet should kill the
inflation tiger. Pray God he may have another chance, and
that he learns to shoot in the meantime.

   THE JUSTICES RULED police may set up roadblocks to catch
drunken drivers.
   The Supreme Court, by a 6-3 vote, said checkpoints in
which police stop every car don't violate the Fourth
Amendment's protection against "unreasonable searches and
seizures." In an opinion written by Chief Justice Rehnquist,
the court upheld a Michigan checkpoint set up in 1986. While
use of checkpoints has become widespread, dissenting justices
said there isn't any evidence to show that checkpoints are
more effective than using police manpower for traffic

   ROMANIA'S ILIESCU MOBILIZED thousands of miners to put
down protests.
   Responding to two days of violence in which his security
forces clashed with anti-Communist demonstrators in
Bucharest, the president-elect summoned the miners, who
streamed into the capital to club people and ransack
opposition party offices. Few police and soldiers were
visible in the city, and the miners were apparently left to
maintain order. Health Ministry officials said five people
were killed and 277 injured in this week's violence. State TV
said the nation's interior minister had been replaced.
   The Bush administration condemned "in the strongest

   Heard on the Street:
   `Dingman's Dogs' Are Barking Grim Message
   As Henley Group's Shares Drop Toward Tank

   NEW YORK -- A graph of Henley Group's stock during the
past year is not a pretty sight.
   The picture is that of a curve descending from $60
(adjusted for a spinoff) in the second quarter of 1989 to $45
at the start of 1990. Yesterday, in trading on the national
over-the-counter market, the shares closed at $31.25, off 25
cents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What's tanking is not only Henley Group's stock, but also
an approach toward investing that was much in favor in the
1980s.
   Henley and its chairman, Michael Dingman, exemplified Wall
Street's faith in a kind of financial alchemy. It was widely
believed that groups of assets could, when adroitly
reshuffled, re-emerge as significantly more valuable. All it
took, the credo held, was an alchemist -- a Mike Dingman --
to bring the value out.
   "Maybe it's the story of the '90s," says a Wall Street
fund manager. "If all you bring to the table is asset
shuffling, maybe you don't bring anything to the table
anymore."
   Henley, based in Hampton, N.H., was created out of the
scrap heap of Allied-Signal. Rather than holding a fire sale
of 35 unwanted businesses, Allied-Signal spun them off in
1986 into a new entity known as Henley Group, to be run by
Mr. Dingman.
   Wall Street hailed this as a stroke of genius, not quite
on a par with the discovery of penicillin but nonetheless
worthy of a then-record initial public offering netting $1.2
billion.
   Henley's assets were known as "Dingman's dogs," but this
was a term of affection. Via restructurings, spinoffs and
sales, Mr. Dingman was widely expected to spin gold from
straw.
   Henley was burdened with too much in goodwill write-offs
to show any earnings; it was an asset play from the start.
And Henley's 10-K annual report was clear as to its purpose.
It didn't "anticipate building an integrated enterprise."
Rather, it would seek to "reposition its operating entitites
{to} add value to the whole."
   Spinoffs followed in rapid order; four have been executed
so far. Last year, Henley noted in its spring 1989 annual
report that an investor who bought stock at the initial
offering price and retained the spunoff shares would have had
a pretax gain of 38%.
   Alas, this year's annual report doesn't update the
calculation. But Henley says that, as of yesterday, the
original stake had grown by 18% -- a paltry pretax gain over
four years.
   Henley's major assets include 37% of Itel stock; 7% of
Wheelabrator Technologies; a big (but barely breakeven)
Chilean methanol plant; Pneumo Abex, a heavily indebted
aerospace, industrial and defense supplier, and Fisher
International, which distributes and makes scientific and
diagnostic instruments.
   The company's tangible book value is only $19.85 a share.
It doesn't have any earnings. Free cash flow, after deducting
ongoing capital expenditure and interest expense last year,
was a negative $25 million, more or less, a Henley official
says.
   Mr. Dingman has surely been active in the past four years,
but to what end? He pursued Santa Fe Pacific but didn't get
it. He spun off part of Fisher and then bought it back again.
   With Wasserstein Perella as a partner, Henley bought
Pneumo Abex in a $1.2 billion leveraged buy-out, betting that
it could be quickly turned around, carved up and sold. That
idea failed. The next year the investment banking firm sold
its stake to Henley at a 200% profit.
   Analysts say Pneumo Abex was overpriced from the start.
"Whenever you play the greater fool theory, someone gets left
holding the bag," says First Boston analyst R. Jackson
Blackstock. In this case, the someone was Henley Group.
   The liquidation, and the shuffling, is still in progress.
Henley now plans to spin off 100% of Fisher and 35% of Pneumo
Abex.
   Alan Snyder, a San Francisco money manager and Henley
stockholder, says "the value is still there" -- meaning much
higher than where the stock is today.
   Mr. Dingman says, "I think the overall concept {of Henley}
was good. For investors to be content, they have to stick
with you" for the entire process. Asked whether, in the case
of Fisher, there has been too much shuffling, Mr. Dingman
allows: "In hindsight, I wished it hadn't happened the way it
did." As for Pneumo Abex, he says: "The idea that you can buy
something you have never managed and assume you are going to
liquidate is a lousy presumption." But Mr. Dingman says both
units should grow smartly. And he predicts that Henley's own
liquidation is on track for the end of 1991, and that holders
will reap "a damn sight higher" price than the current level.
   Analysts are neutral to mildly bullish; several say the
stock has become cheap. In general, the sentiment is that Mr.
Dingman should be able to wring out some surplus value.
   But Eli Lustgarten, of PaineWebber, has dared in a recent
report to say what no one in the 1980s imagined. "The current
stock price (then 36 1/4) "may fairly reflect break-up
value," he wrote. In other words: reshuffling a deck doesn't
necessarily revalue it.

   NEW YORK -- Chock Full O' Nuts Corp. named 47-year-old
Marvin Haas a vice chairman of the coffee and food-service
company.
   The company's other vice chairman is George Rudy, who is
77. Leon Pordy, Chock Full's 70-year-old chairman and chief
executive officer, said that he has no plans to retire and
that Mr. Haas is "moving up the ladder." Mr. Haas has been
overseeing the Greenwich Mills food-service division in
Secaucus, N.J., and "and he's done very well," Dr. Pordy
said.

<TEXT>
   "We've really turned {the company} around," Dr. Pordy
said. "We've got earnings coming out this year that are
probably the highest in 10 years."
   For many years, Chock Full O' Nuts concentrated on retail
coffee sales, and Dr. Pordy said it now is No. 4 in that
industry behind Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft General Foods,
which produces Maxwell House; Procter &amp; Gamble Co., with its
Folger's brand; and Nestle S.A. But Chock Full now is also
one of the largest institutional food-service firms east of
the Mississippi River, he said.
   In November 1988, the company acquired Jimbo's Jumbos
Inc., a processor and packager of peanuts, and "that's been a
very successful enterprise," Dr. Pordy said.
   The balance sheet "looks good," he added. The company has
just $45 million of 8% bonds and $55 million of 7% bonds
outstanding, and $40 million in cash.

   TOKYO -- Japanese corporations reported an average 8.3%
pretax earnings increase in the fiscal year ended March 31,
or a total of 10.050 trillion yen ($64.3 billion), owing to
brisk domestic demand such as personal consumption and
corporate equipment investment, the Tokyo Stock Exchange
said.
   Exchange officials said a study of fiscal 1989 earnings
reports submitted by 959 of the companies listed on the
market also showed that net profits went up 13% from the
previous fiscal year to 4.845 trillion yen and sales jumped
17% to 310.687 trillion yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Another study, of 1,067 companies, indicated that fiscal
1990 pretax earnings will grow more slowly, by 2.2%. Net
profits will rise 5.4% and sales 1.5%, according to exchange
officials.
   While Japanese companies, as in the previous fiscal year,
posted profit gains in fiscal 1989, they said, the pace of
growth slowed because of the yen's decline and higher oil
prices. In fiscal 1988, pretax earnings surged 25%.
   Fiscal 1989 manufacturer pretax earnings rose 11% and
sales 7.9%, showing gains for the third consecutive year. In
contrast, non-manufacturer earnings languished, displaying a
3.2% gain despite a 23% surge in sales due to substantial
declines incurred by electric power and gas suppliers as a
result of rate cutbacks, higher oil prices and the yen's
decline. When power and gas companies were excluded, for
instance, non-manufacturer earnings went up 17%, officials
noted.
   They said 26 industries, including real estate, shipping
and petroleum, reported gains in sales in fiscal 1989. Only
one, agriculture-fishery-forestry, showed a drop, they said.
   The shipping industry posted a 98% surge in pretax
earnings due to recovery in shipping world-wide and
restructuring efforts that included rounds of layoffs and
removal of cost-ineffective ships from operations.
   Brisk demand for machine tools and construction machines
pushed pretax earnings by machinery manufacturers up 30%
above the fiscal 1988 levels, while the construction industry
showed a 26% gain owing to a private-sector construction boom
during the year.
   Rising market prices of copper, zinc and other metals
combined with demand for processed metal alloys and
construction materials to boost profits by the nonferrous
metal industry by 21%.

   HONG KONG -- The jobless rate in the three months ended
April 30 rose to a seasonally adjusted 1.8%, its highest
level since mid-1988, from 1.5% a year earlier and 1.3% in
the three months ended Jan. 31, according to government data.
   The figures bolster a trend that government officials have
predicted would stem from the colony's economic slowdown that
began in last year's second half. Last month's statistics
showed first-quarter unemployment at 1.7%. The provisional
unemployment rate for the three months ended May 31 indicated
a decline in unemployment to 1.6%.

total pretax cost of the reorganization to be $15 million to
$25 million, which will be recorded in the second half of
1990.
   The telecommunications concern said it will offer about
900 employees in its telephone operations sector a three-year
age and service credit as a retirement incentive. Contel said
about 14,000 employees are covered by the division's pension
plan.

   A EuroFed That Would Mint Trouble

   When pollsters ask Europeans these days whether they want
a single currency, the answer often comes back "yes."
Everyone seems to agree that having a single currency would
be more efficient. According to this argument, a single
currency would make it possible to avoid the transaction
costs of flexible or badly managed exchange rates. But, to be
fair, the pollsters ought to phrase their query this way:
"How much inflation are you ready to bear for the benefit of
having a single European currency?"
   The truth is that a single currency could bring inflation.
To their question, the pollsters should append a table
showing the rate at which that inflation could grow: starting
with 2% and jumping two points at a time up to 10%, then five
points at a time up to 20%, and 10 points thereafter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The problem is that "joining" a currency means locking in
to the policy of its central bank. Few Europeans would have
plumped for an obligatory European currency at the cost of
Brazilian-style hyperinflation or British stop-and-go.
Indeed, Brazil does have the advantage of a single currency,
but it's likely that many Brazilians would prefer not to be
forced to use the cruzeiro. And in Britain, the Scots could
have done without Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
and his political cycle.
   Last year European Commission President Jacques Delors
presented a report that spelled out stages for the creation
of a European currency. It was drawn up by central bank
governors and experts from different parts of the Common
Market, and approved by assembled heads of state in Madrid
last summer. That document, though, does little to ease
worries over the quality of the proposed united currency. Nor
does it provide much information on how the current European
Monetary System is supposed to evolve into a full-blown
monetary union.
   Guarantees for a sound European currency are no more than
implicit. The Delors Report proposes a European Federal Bank
along the lines of the U.S. Federal Reserve System. The
European System of Central Banks -- or EuroFed -- would enjoy
a modicum of independence from state and European Community
political powers, "through the appropriate guarantee of
stability" of the members of its council.
   The Delors Report mentions "price stability" as the
objective of the EuroFed's monetary policy. But it would
prohibit lending to member-countries or to the EC as a whole,
and this would be a weak barrier against inflation.
   The EC Commission and European Parliament have already
started to talk about how they would control the EuroFed.
And, it should be noted, the American Fed has not been
exemplary in its behavior over the years. Its policy errors
deepened the crisis of 1929 and turned it into a world
depression. The Fed has also given us sorry instances of
monetary stop-go, or rather "go-stop," as when it aided
President Lyndon Johnson in simultaneously financing the
Vietnam War and the War on Poverty with the printing press;
or when it allowed Richard Nixon to decouple the dollar from
gold; or when the monetary follies of Jimmy Carter had to be
corrected by Paul Volcker putting his foot on the brakes in
the early Reagan years.
   The Delors Report doesn't mention this, but the truth is
that the West German mark would be the dominant element in
any unified currency -- however it may be defined. The
Bundesbank, the German central bank, is expected to prove a
foil against inflationary temptations. West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has openly called for an independent EuroFed on
the model of the Bundesbank. But recent events have shown the
Bundesbank, this linchpin of the EuroFed, to be anything but
a model of independence.
   After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Milton Friedman
advocated that the East German and West German mark be put on
a free float. The two currencies would have found their
level. For a time, a cheap exchange rate would have
compensated for the low productivity of communist firms and
Eastern workers. Any excess human exodus could have been
reversed when overcrowding and unemployment in the West made
steadily improving conditions in the East relatively more
attractive. If necessary, funds to compensate the East
Germans for many years of suffering could have been collected
through a special tax levied on the West.
   These are powerful arguments. However, at least one
central bank governor and one Delors Committee expert derided
this proposal as "politically unrealistic." The solution
imposed by Chancellor Kohl was to force the hand of the
"independent" Bundesbank to impose the exchange rate he found
electorally expedient: One-to-one. The transformation of the
East thus will be unduly trammeled. The likely extension of
West Germany's social security system to the less productive
ex-communist Laender will reinforce the likelihood of a
Puerto Rican situation developing there.
   The Bundesbank can now choose either to sterilize this
increase of the monetary base and push interest rates up, or
not sterilize and permit a higher rate of inflation. What can
users of the West German mark do? Lump it and bear the higher
interest rates, or the speedier price inflation, or a
combination of the two. And the Germans can say: "If you
don't like it, stop using the mark." Precisely.
   That, up to a point, is the solution. But under a wider
European Monetary System, Europeans would have no such
liberty. In that case, the unilateral decision of West
Germany would mean the entry of German-created inflation
through the back door.
   What would happen if the present or an enhanced
competition among European currencies were to continue or to
develop? If the advantages of having a single European
currency -- be it the mark or a redefined ECU -- were so
overwhelming, Europeans would choose to use it. It is most
unlikely that even then the mark would monopolize Europe.
Different moneys would predominate in each place for
different uses -- if no controls were placed on currencies
throughout the Common Market.
   The division could also be geographic. It could happen
that the mark would not predominate in every region, despite
its historical superiority. There might be regions preferring
a slightly riskier currency because they temporarily need
more credit: The rate of interest would therefore be
sustainably higher in outlying parts. In other words, there
is no saying whether the monetary zone should coincide with,
or be larger or smaller than, the Common Market.
   Free currency competition and flexible exchange rates are
the cheapest kind of regional policy. During the time when a
poorer region lags behind, a relatively weak exchange rate
can help the region compete.
   The Delors Report's answer to the regional harshness of an
imposed single currency is to propose handing out grants to
underprivileged regions. But it will be near impossible to
fine-tune these handouts to compensate for the difference
between transaction-cost benefits of a single currency, and
losses that result from being forced to use the German
interest rate. Given the political mechanisms of the Common
Market, this proposal could well develop into another subsidy
mess like Europe's Common Agricultural Policy.
   The main argument for a single currency is reduction in
financial transaction costs. But higher prices could negate
this "reduction." Local prices would reflect costs that used
to be expressed in exchange rates. A better model is the
flexible exchange-rate system in place between the U.S. and
Canada today. Obviously, a single currency is not needed for
economic union. A customs union with North America -- not a
currency union -- would be right for Mexico. The truth is
that the only good argument against letting Europeans choose
what currencies they will use is political, not economic.
   Some defend the EuroFed with the argument that a new
central bank would play the same role toward Europe's more
inflationary countries that the International Monetary Fund
plays for the underdeveloped nations of the Third World:
bogyman. This is a sorry comment on their and Europe's
democratic institutions. However, if this is so, why do the
central bankers of those inflation-prone nations want to be
present in the councils of the EuroFed?
   A final argument for a European currency is that there can
be no United States of Europe without a single currency.
This, indeed, is the most frightening argument. The original
principle was to build a European confederation that
maintained the possibility of secession. History has shown us
many sad examples of confederations transformed into
centralized, high-spending federations. Often, the result was
civil war: Look at England and Scotland in 1707, Switzerland
in 1848, Nigeria in 1970, and, perhaps, the Soviet Union in
the 1990s. Symbols of undivided sovereignty are a portent of
danger.

   NEW YORK -- A sharp drop in the price of gold sparked a
modest rally in the bond market as foreign investors sold
commodities and snapped up U.S. Treasury bonds.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 point
yesterday, a gain of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
its price, fell to 8.34%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rally kicked off during overnight trading in London,
where prices of gold futures plunged through the
psychologically important $350 level in heavy selling by
Saudi Arabian investors. The London afternoon gold price was
fixed at $345.85, the lowest since July 1986. British
government bonds, called gilts, rose as much as 1 1/4 point
yesterday.
   Although a mildly disappointing inflation report caused
U.S. bond prices to decline during early U.S. trading, the
market reversed direction later in the day as the slide in
gold hurt other precious metals.
   Traders in both London and New York said that some of the
cash flowing out of gold showed up later in intermediate-term
U.S. and British bonds.
   Brian J. Fabbri, a managing director at Midland Montagu
Securities Inc., said investors "selling gold have wanted to
get out of commodities and purchase some financial assets,"
in the U.S. and British bond markets.
   Mr. Fabbri said that in recent weeks, the value of the
dollar has "held up extremely well" while the value of the
British pound has "soared." Meanwhile, bond yields have
eased. Such trends, he said, have persuaded some foreign
investors that they can earn high returns because they can
earn profits on currency gains as well as capital
appreciation when bond prices rise.
   The decline in gold spread to other commodities and
prompted some economists to reduce their inflation forecasts.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures prices fell
3.89 points to 236.44, the steepest one-day drop since May
1987.
   But trading yesterday was quiet, with foreign investors
accounting for a lot of the buying.
   Robert D. Sbarra, a senior vice president at Carroll
McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc., said that trading was slow because
domestic investors were moving cautiously ahead of today's
important consumer price index report. He said the mood in
the market remains bullish.
   Bonds got off to a weak start yesterday morning, falling
as much as 1/4 point on news that the May producer price
index rose 0.3%. That was slightly higher than had been
expected. Bond prices started to climb again on news that the
CRB index was falling.
   Today, the government will release the May consumer price
index, a broad measure of inflation. A consensus of
economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report expect
a 0.3% rise in last month's CPI. Excluding the food and
energy components, CPI is also seen rising 0.3%.
   The government will also release data on May industrial
production and capacity utilization and the April trade
deficit. The deluge of data due out today is expected to have
a major impact on trading today.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to up 1/8 point in spots
as the market exhibited firm tone ahead of the week's final
round of economic data.
   In municipal activity, a Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. group
repriced $299 million of New York Metropolitan Transportation
Authority service contract revenue bonds to lower the yield
by 0.02 to 0.10 percentage point.
   The issue is now priced to yield from 6.40% for transit
facilities bonds due in 1992 to 7.72% for bonds due in 2016,
changed from being priced to yield from 6.50% in 1992 to
7.75% in 2016.
   Also, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group repriced $710
million New York City general obligation bonds, to lower some
yields. The bonds were originally priced Wednesday.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 ended unchanged at 98 5/8 to yield
7.30%.
   No large municipal bond issues are expected to be priced
today.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds were moderately higher yesterday. The
benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 104
11/32 compared with 103 30/32 on Wednesday. The latest
10-year notes ended at 103 11/32 to yield 8.35% compared with
103 4/32 to yield 8.38%.
   Short-term rates were unchanged to slightly lower. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.67%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.91%, unchanged from
Wednesday. The rate on six-month bills was 7.55% for a yield
of 7.96%, slightly lower.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk-bond market took a breather after Wednesday's
frenzied pace and ended little changed.
   While prices of most junk bonds or speculative-grade
securities barely budged, high-yield bonds of Southland Corp.
advanced on news that the company has proposed a revised
restructuring plan that it says offers substantially improved
terms to bondholders and preferred stockholders.
   Southland's 16.75% subordinated debentures, maturing in
2002, climbed two points to finish at a bid price of 9 while
the company's 15.75% senior subordinated notes, due in 1997,
surged four points to end at 19. Offerings for the 15.75%
notes shot up eight points. However, junk bond dealers said
there was little trading in the Southland debt.
   As Southland bonds advanced, Trump Taj Mahal Funding bonds
slipped on a report that a number of creditors are balking at
a plan to restructure the empire of real estate developer
Donald Trump.
   Trump Taj Mahal 14% bonds, due in 1998, slid 1 3/4 points
to 55 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange. Also lower were
Trump Castle Funding's 13.75% bonds, due in 1997, which
skidded 1 point to 59.
   Earlier this week, the Trump bonds climbed on news that
Mr. Trump had reached a tentative agreement with his major
bankers that would give him time and money to restructure his
crippled holdings.
   Elsewhere, in the high-yield market, junk bonds of RJR
Nabisco Inc. stabilized after sprinting sharply higher
Wednesday.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds ended sharply higher for the
third consecutive day, although prices slipped off session
peaks due to profit-taking and a dip in the U.S. Treasury
market.
   Prices rose strongly during the morning, buoyed by foreign
buying, falling gold prices and gains in the U.S. bond market
late Wednesday.
   British government bonds, called gilts, got a further
boost from economic data suggesting further weakness in the
labor market. Britain's unemployment rate rose to a
seasonally adjusted 5.7% in May from 5.6% in April, its first
monthly rise since July 1986.
   Gilts prices eased somewhat later after a disappointing
report on U.S. inflation caused prices of U.S. Treasury bonds
to fall. U.S. Treasurys recovered later in the day and ended
higher.
   Inflation will be the focus of the gilts market today,
when the government reports the May retail-prices index.
   Among benchmark issues, Britain's 11.75% bond due
2003/2007 rose 1 1/4 points to 103 1/4 to yield 11.26% while
the 12% notes due in 1995 jumped 3/4 point to 100 14/32 to
yield 11.88%.
   Japanese government bonds also ended higher. West German
financial markets were closed in observance of the Corpus
Christi holiday.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Yields on Chrysler Corp. debt securities rose yesterday in
the wake of actions by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   S&amp;P said late yesterday that it lowered the senior debt
ratings of Chrysler Corp., Chrysler Financial Corp. and
Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd. The S&amp;P rating changes come just
a day after Moody's placed the auto maker's senior debt under
review for possible downgrade.
   S&amp;P also lowered certain debt ratings of Ford Motor Co.,
but there was little change in Ford bonds because the rating
change came late in the day.
   In trading, yields on Chrysler's 9.60% notes, maturing in
1994, climbed from 10.25% to 10.50%. Yields on other Chrysler
debt securities also rose similarly.
   Meanwhile, in the new-issue market for investment-grade
corporate debt, nearly $500 million in new debt issues were
priced yesterday, including a $200 million issue of Dow
Capital B.V. 20-year debentures. Dow Capital is a unit of Dow
Chemical Co. The securities were priced at par to yield 9.20%
through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Most investment-grade corporate bonds finished between 3/8
point to 1/2 point higher.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities ended with slight gains on the
back of U.S. Treasurys.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
were up 5/32 at 99 25/32, Ginnie Mae 10% issues were 1/8
firmer at 102 1/8. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
securities were 3/32 higher at 99 1/32 and 10% securities
were 1/8 firmer at 101 2/32. Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities were 3/32 firmer at 99 1/2 and
10% securities were up 1/8 at 101 17/32.
   The market showed little reaction to yesterday's report on
producer prices.

   U.S. Aide Urges
   Cut in Payments
   On Amgen Drug

   WASHINGTON -- A federal health official proposed reducing
Medicare payments that kidney-dialysis centers receive for
providing EPO, an anti-anemia drug.
   Michael Mangano, a deputy inspector general at the
Department of Health and Human Services, told a House health
subcommittee that dialysis centers administering the drug
nationwide were earning an average gross profit "in excess of
40%."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The drug, formally known as recombinant erythropoietin, is
manufactured by Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif. The
company, which has come under considerable criticism itself
for its pricing of the drug, declined to send a
representative to the hearing. The company said it already
had longstanding commitments to meet with investors and
others in New York. Instead, the company submitted written
testimony explaining and defending the drug's price. Amgen
negotiated EPO's reimbursement level last year with Medicare.
   EPO is marketed primarily to participants in Medicare's
dialysis program, which provides coverage to more than 90% of
all patients with chronic renal failure. Under the Food and
Drug Administration's orphan drug program, Amgen has been
granted a seven-year monopoly to market the drug to dialysis
patients.
   Rep. Pete Stark (D., Calif.), who led the House Ways and
Means subcommittee hearing, said that the federal government
had a stong interest in "getting its money's worth" from
Amgen, and he pronounced himself "disappointed" that no
company executives appeared to testify.
   Mr. Mangano said that the dialysis centers were billing
the federal government at a flat rate -- generally $40 per
patient -- that assumes an average patient dose to be 5,000
units. But the centers were administering an average patient
dose of only 2,700 units, he said, enabling the centers to
realize the difference as profit.
   Instead of being paid the flat rate, Mr. Mangano
recommended that the centers be reimbursed according to the
amount of the drug used.
   Mr. Mangano's findings were challenged at the hearing by
Mardee Hagen, president of the National Renal Administrators
Association, a trade group representing dialysis centers. Ms.
Hagen said that HHS hadn't considered the costs associated
with administering the drug, including syringes and needles,
lab time and paperwork tasks. She also said that because of
possible adverse effects of the drug, which received FDA
approval a year ago, physicians were being "conservative in
their dosages to limit the possibility of complications."
   Some questions remain about the savings that could be
realized from the HHS proposal. Mr. Mangano told the hearing
that Medicare could save $80 million annually by paying on a
per-unit basis, "assuming the current dosage level is
medically appropriate." But written testimony submitted by
the Office of Technology Assessment, a research arm of
Congress, said that per-unit payments "would almost certainly
lead to higher doses per patient." Instead, the OTA
recommended lowering the flat rate paid to dialysis centers.
   Gordon M. Binder, Amgen's chief executive officer, said
Amgen is satisfied that the current flat-rate system "seems
to work reasonably well." He said that he had reservations
about the HHS proposal because tying the price to the current
average doseage level might mean some "patients wouldn't get
the proper amount." He added that such a change would be more
of a financial concern for dialysis centers than for Amgen.
   Analysts said that neither of the government proposals
immediately threaten Amgen's prospects, but that the two
plans' eventual impacts on the company would range from
slightly negative to slightly positive. In general, Amgen is
in the comfortable position of having its corporate interests
tied to those of its patients.
   The difference between the flat Medicare payment of $40
per treatment and an estimated $27 to $29 average treatment
cost for EPO is kept by the dialysis center to cover overhead
and profit. Thus, the facility can increase its margin by
reducing the amount of EPO furnished to patients.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Amgen
shares rose $1.125 to $75.125.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices moved lower as nervousness about
corporate earnings rattled a market already worried about an
imminent flurry of economic data and the quarterly expiration
of stock-index futures and options.
   Earnings-related selling sent both United
Telecommunications and Digital Equipment lower in heavy
trading and continued to depress bank stocks, which paced the
market's retreat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Blue-chip issues were spared the worst of the selling and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped just 1.48 to
2928.22; Wednesday's closing figure was revised to 2929.70.
By comparison, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index posted the
equivalent of a 15-point loss in the 30-stock average by
falling 2.00 to 362.90.
   Among other measures, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index dropped 1.02 to 197.98 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index fell 1.89 to 337.93. Declining issues
outpaced advancers on the Big Board by 917 to 560.
   Trading activity slowed to a crawl during the afternoon as
market participants set their sights on today's economic
data, especially the May consumer price index, and the
"triple witching hour" closeout of June index futures and
options contracts.
   Volume on the Big Board dropped to 135,770,000 shares from
158.9 million Wednesday. "A lot of institutions are on the
sidelines, for fear of getting into the market," said
Christopher Pedersen, head of trading at Twenty-First
Securities.
   Three key pieces of economic data besides the consumer
price index are also due today: the April trade deficit and
figures on May industrial production and capacity
utilization.
   Stocks slipped at the opening although the report on May
producer prices met expectations, with the index going up
0.3% overall and 0.2% excluding food and energy prices, which
tend to be volatile.
   The market then retreated to session lows at late morning
following word from Digital that analysts' earnings forecasts
of $1.60 to $1.80 a share for the quarter ending this month
"would appear to be too optimistic."
   Futures-related sell programs related to stock-index
arbitrage, involving the purchase of index futures and the
sale of baskets of stocks, hit the market briefly as the
industrial average skidded to a loss of more than 22 points.
   Analysts have been expecting that earnings for the current
quarter would be below year-ago levels, as they were in the
first quarter. Net income for the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 was
down 18% in the previous period.
   But Suresh L. Bhirud, chief investment strategist at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., says earnings disappointments for the
second quarter could be more widespread, based on evidence
that economic weakness "is almost in all sectors."
   S&amp;P 500 earnings for the quarter are likely to be 15% to
20% lower than a year earlier, he says, adding that the
market is probably "in for rough sledding over the next
couple of months as companies are going to report terrible
earnings."
   United Telecom skidded 3 1/4 to 40 7/8 in Big Board
composite trading of 4.3 million shares -- eight times the
stock's average daily volume -- after both PaineWebber and
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette lowered earnings estimates for
the second quarter, this year and next year.
   PaineWebber analyst Jack Grubman said he had been
expecting the company's second-quarter revenue to increase 5%
to 6% from the first-quarter level, but now anticipates a 3%
to 4% rise as the result of slower-than-expected revenue
growth at its US Sprint long-distance unit.
   Also, Donaldson Lufkin analyst Joel D. Gross said the
company's first-quarter revenue was lower than expected,
leading to a "ripple effect" over subsequent quarters. He
expects revenue to be up 5% on a quarter-to-quarter basis in
the current period.
   Digital, which also said its profitability isn't meeting
expectations, retreated 1 3/4 to 86 3/8 as 1.2 million shares
were traded. The company didn't provide an earnings
projection for the quarter.
   Bank stocks dropped across the board for the second
session in a row amid jitters about the potential impact of
loan problems on their earnings. Among major-city issues,
Citicorp went down 1/2 to 23 1/8 on 1.3 million shares,
BankAmerica lost 7/8 to 31 1/8 and J.P. Morgan dropped 3/4 to
36 1/2.
   Chase Manhattan dipped 5/8 to 24 5/8; the company said it
is considering selling assets and paring some of its
activities.
   Security Pacific fell 1 to 39 3/8 and Wells Fargo lost 3
3/8 to 78 1/4 after Moody's Investors Service lowered ratings
on debt issues of the two bank holding companies. The agency
cited concerns about their real estate and leveraged buy-out
loans.
   As for other regionals, NCNB skidded 2 1/2 to 37 7/8, MNC
Financial slipped 3/8 to 14 3/4, Banc One fell 1 1/8 to 29
5/8, Citizens &amp; Southern lost 3/4 to 25 and Fleet/Norstar
Financial Group dropped 1 1/2 to 20 3/4.
   Precious-metals stocks were hit with selling after the
price of gold dropped below $350 an ounce. Homestake Mining
dropped 1 to 15 3/4, Hecla Mining fell 5/8 to 11 1/8, Placer
Dome dropped 1/2 to 13 3/4, Newmont Gold tumbled 1 1/2 to 36
5/8 and ASA lost 1 3/8 to 43.
   Wendy's International rose 3/8 to 7 1/4 and peaked at 7
3/8, a 52-week high; more than three million shares changed
hands as the recent burst of activity in the stock
accelerated. Recurring rumors that PepsiCo may be interested
in buying the fast-food company have spurred interest in the
stock, traders said. Wendy's declined to comment on the
speculation.
   Dividend-related trades swelled volume in Empresa
Nacionale de Electricidad, which closed unchanged at 22 1/2
on three million shares, and British Airways, which ended
unchanged at 37 1/4 on 2.7 million shares. Both companies
will make their next quarterly payouts to shareholders of
record today.
   Gillette gained 1 3/8 to 58 1/4. Kidder Peabody upgraded
its investment rating on the stock to the firm's highest
level, reflecting better-than-anticipated sales of the
company's Sensor razor in its first four months on the
market.
   Kellogg dropped 1 5/8 to 69 3/8 after Goldman Sachs took
the stock off its list of recommended issues. Analysts said
the company now expects U.S. cereal shipments for the second
quarter to be down about 15% from the year-ago level,
compared with an earlier projection of a 10% decline.
Separately, Goldman repeated a buy recommendation on General
Mills, which rose 1 1/4 to 84 1/4.
   Lone Star Industries rose 1/2 to 10 1/8. The company
agreed to sell all of its preferred-stock holdings in Tarmac
America, the U.S. unit of Britain's Tarmac PLC, back to the
subsidiary for $147 million.
   Amcast Industrial lost 5/8 to 9 1/2. The company reported
that net income for the fiscal quarter ended June 3 dropped
8.4% from a year earlier.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.74
to 364.30. Volume totaled 10,840,000 shares.

   NEW YORK -- The three major broadcast networks are closing
ranks in the battle over viewer-measurement practices by
uniformly adopting a plan to reduce the audience size they
guarantee to advertisers.
   Yesterday, CBS Inc. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. announced
they will adopt a plan proposed earlier this week by the NBC
network. Under the NBC plan, the networks would project
audience size for the new TV season, which begins in
September, by using an average of audience levels over the
last eight years. The networks will make audience-size
guarantees to advertisers based on the projections rather
than based solely on ratings from A.C. Nielsen Co., as they
have in the past.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The network moves come as advertisers are preparing to
enter the projected $4.4 billion "up-front" market, when
commercials are purchased in advance of the 1990-91
television season. Because the Nielsen ratings showed an
unexplained, steep drop in TV viewership of about 7% earlier
this year, the networks had to shell out as much as $200
million in "make goods," or free advertising for sponsors
when audience guarantee levels fell below network
projections.
   To avoid having to pay millions back to advertisers, the
three networks have been seeking to change the system by
which they guarantee audience size. Advertisers view with
alarm any change in the audience-guarantee system; some
advertisers said they will attempt to negotiate lower prices
for ads, characterizing the networks' move as, in effect, a
price increase. Also, advertisers said they will consider
redirecting millions of dollars usually spent on network TV
to other places, such as cable TV.
   "The networks could see a lot of money walking out and
redirected into other media," said Jon Mandel, senior vice
president and director of national broadcast for Grey
Advertising Inc.
   But advertisers have threatened to abandon the networks
before, only to ultimately increase the amount they spend.
And advertising executives acknowledge they have little
choice but to continue to spend heavily on network television
to reach large national audiences. "Even though we don't like
this departure from tradition, you have to admit you still
reach millions of people at once through network TV," said
John Sisk, senior vice president of network negotiating at J.
Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group.
   The proposal to change the system was suggested earlier
this week by No. 1-rated National Broadcasting Co., a unit of
General Electric Co. ABC dropped an earlier proposal of its
own in favor of the NBC plan, and CBS, which had been mulling
over prospects, said late yesterday that the NBC plan "in
principle, is acceptable to us."
   News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co. network, which will
increase its broadcast to five nights from three beginning in
September, said it would continue to guarantee viewing levels
for advertisers.
   Fox is expected to benefit financially from adhering to
traditional audience-guarantee methods. Last year, Fox
received about $350 million in up-front sales. This year,
that number could easily double, according to industry
officials.
   The networks contend that Nielsen's button-pushing people
meter, the main method it uses to compile ratings, is
inaccurate. The audience, say the networks, gets tired of
pressing the buttons and stops using the device. The result
is a huge dropoff of viewers that might actually still be
watching, the networks allege.
   Nielsen said there is nothing fundamentally wrong with its
system, and advertisers agree. Betsy Frank, senior vice
president at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, said that NBC's
plan was "based on a faulty premise that said Nielsen was
flawed. It covers up the fact that the networks are
responsible for getting people to tune to television."
   And network television viewing continues to decrease. A
Nielsen spokesman said late yesterday that the average rating
in prime time for a network affiliate was down 10% in May
from last May, while ratings for non-pay cable channels rose
27%. In the late-night slot, network affiliates were down
6.6% in May and non-pay cable was up 25.6%.
   An ABC official said the network dropped its earlier
proposal, which used audience levels from the past three
years, because it was widely perceived that NBC's plan was
gaining acceptance among advertisers.
   Larry Hoffner, executive vice president of network sales
at NBC, said his plan "recognized the trend that television
viewership was down. ABC's didn't. The industry looked at the
two proposals and said that ours made more sense."

   Western Union Corp. got a green light from the Securities
and Exchange Commission to proceed with its exchange offer
aimed at averting bankruptcy court.
   However, SEC approval came as the beleaguered
communications and financial services company said it will
technically default on a $51 million semiannual interest
payment due today. A spokesman said in New York that under
the debt agreement, it still has 30 days to make the payment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company has said that current cash flow can't cover
its payments on $643 million in debt and that it will be
forced to seek protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if
it can't work out a new payment schedule with its
bondholders.
   Western Union wants to issue new debt securities to
holders of its 19.25% senior secured reset notes due Dec. 15,
1992 and 16% notes due June 15, 1991. Debt from these notes
totals $530 million. Western Union is also seeking to
reclassify its preferred stock into new common shares.

   NEW YORK -- The dollar was mixed as foreign exchange
traders generally pushed it higher despite concerns the
Federal Reserve might ease credit.
   While traders and economists agreed the May producer price
index figures, released yesterday, leave plenty of room for
the Fed to push down interest rates, the data weren't
compelling enough that the Fed would be forced to ease.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hedging against the outside chance of a slight producer
price rise of about 0.1% on the month, the market took
short-dollar positions Wednesday and early yesterday, traders
said. When Labor Department data showed the index rose 0.3%,
higher than the consensus forecast of 0.2%, they squared
their positions, lifting the dollar.
   But no one was ready to take any big risks with the key
U.S. data scheduled for release today, traders said.
   Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6935
marks, up from 1.6865 marks late Wednesday. The U.S. currency
also was changing hands at 154.17 yen, down from 154.75 yen.
Sterling was trading at $1.7080, below $1.7115.
   In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at about 154.25 at
midmorning, down from 154.50 soon after the opening; it
closed Thursday in Tokyo at 153.53 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S.
currency was trading at about 1.6930 marks.
   Dealers said the market, especially thin Thursday because
of a holiday in West Germany, was dominated by professional
participants and institutional speculators, with large
industrial customers refraining from placing orders.
   The result, said Ian Foakes, foreign exchange manager for
PaineWebber International, was "short-time plays, which lead
to a nervous, self-correcting market," rather than one that
could establish a trend.
   Ever since the report at the beginning of this month that
U.S. employment was weak in May, market participants have
been waiting for monetary easing.
   On Wednesday, the U.S. reported that May retail sales also
had been anemic, falling 0.7%. Reports today on May consumer
prices and industrial production and the April trade balance
are assumed to be all that the U.S. central bank needs to
make its decision.
   U.S. administration and Congressional pressure for easing
is strong. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady gave the Fed a
strong hint yesterday by saying he is encouraged by the PPI
report. But Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, in
apparent reply, said that interest rates will fall "very
significantly" if a credible federal budget deficit reduction
accord is reached.
   PPI's seasonally adjusted gain from April, before
rounding, represents a 3.1% compounded annual rate. So far in
calendar 1990, the PPI has risen at a 4% compounded annual
rate.
   Mr. Greenspan has repeatedly called for an inflation rate
that has zero effect on investment, spending and saving
decisions. That would mean an annual price increase rate of
1% to 2%, said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for
Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
   "{Thursday's} report is not going to change the Fed's mind
{about credit policy}. The core change in prices is not
enough to make any central banker uncomfortable," Mr. Kellner
said. Core producer prices, which exclude food and energy,
rose only 0.2% in May.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $345.55 an ounce.

   MONTVALE, N.J. -- Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., looking
to better its position in Europe, said it will move its world
headquarters to London and named a new chief executive
officer.
   Inter-Continental, which is jointly owned by Japan's
Saison Group and SAS Group, parent of Scandinavian Airlines
System, said the move to London will consolidate corporate
staff. It said the changes are part of a restructuring that
will result in two hotel operating divisions: the five-star
Inter-Continental hotels and the more moderately priced Forum
Hotel chain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The consolidation should be completed by year end, and
will mean the current corporate staff of 425 will be reduced
by about 175 people, a spokeswoman for Inter-Continental
said. Most of those layoffs will be in support and clerical
staff, but some executives will lose jobs, she said. Some
people will be offered relocation, she added.
   The company also said John van Praag was named chief
executive, succeeding John Calvert, who chose not to relocate
to London. It said he will remain in North America as an
adviser.
   Mr. van Praag, 53 years old, is on the board of Saison
Overseas Holdings B.V., the Amsterdam-based holding company
for Inter-Continental. He joined Saison Group in 1988.
   The company also said J.T. Kuhlman was named president of
the Inter-Continental hotels division, and that a president
of the Forum Hotels division should be named shortly. Mr.
Kuhlman formerly was senior vice president for
Inter-Continental in charge of its France/Mediterranean
region.

   Armstrong World Industries Inc. said it completed the
second phase of the sale of Georgia woodlands to an
undisclosed buyer, resulting in a pretax gain of $40 million
for the second quarter.
   In the 1989 second quarter, the Lancaster, Pa., flooring
and building products maker had profit from continuing
operations of $44.6 million, or 95 cents a share. Net income
was $47.9 million, or $1.02 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first part of the sale, completed March 30, resulted
in a first-quarter gain of $16.5 million, or 40 cents a
share. The second-quarter gain is expected to exceed that
amount.
   Armstrong said it sold a total of 89,000 acres of
woodlands, which were a source of raw materials and fuel for
the company's ceiling products. The company said it will fill
its ceiling needs through other sources.

   Senate Clears Bill for Employee Leave
   For Childbirth, Adoption, Family Illness

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate sent to the White House landmark
legislation that would guarantee workers as much as 12 weeks
annual unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption or serious
family illnesses.
   The action, by a simple voice vote, sets the stage for a
potential veto confrontation with the Bush administration,
which has allied itself with business interests opposed to
such statutorily mandated benefits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Senate vote gave no final measure of support, but the
same bill passed the House last month by a 237-187 margin, or
less than the two-thirds needed to override a veto.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), the chief sponsor, said
he hoped to meet with the president to avert a veto, and
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) read back
Mr. Bush's pledge of a "kinder, gentler" nation before the
vote.
   Leading Republicans were unconvinced, and the Democratic
triumph is more strategic than decisive. After years of
crusading for action, Mr. Dodd has moved the issue to the
White House, but the GOP is confident it can sustain a veto
by the president. "He will veto it," said Sen. Strom Thurmond
(R., S.C.), "and the veto will be upheld."
   "Now the focus is on President Bush," said Judith
Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. "We
are by no means convinced that he will veto this bill."
   Administration officials and business groups believe such
benefits should be offered voluntarily without the government
telling companies what to do. Business advocates also raise
concerns over the cost of finding and training replacement
workers and covering health insurance for employees on leave.
They say it would reduce existing benefits and favor only
high-paid employees who can afford unpaid time off in any
case.
   Proponents of the bill say the legislation is a necessity
in a nation where many working parents are caught between the
demands of work and raising a family. Nationally, 56% of
women with children under six years old are in the work
force.
   The measure would provide 12 weeks annual unpaid leave to
cover either the employee's own medical emergency or the care
of newborn or adopted children or seriously ill family
members. Employers would be required to guarantee jobs and
continue to provide health benefits during the worker's
absence.
   Companies with fewer than 50 employees aren't covered by
the measure, which thereby exempts all but 5% of the nation's
employers. Sponsors estimate the measure would cost business
$236 million annually.
   These provisions are less stringent than those first
approved by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,
which exempted only employers with fewer than 20 workers and
required separate leave periods of 10 weeks in cases of
family needs and 13 weeks for medical needs, or a maximum of
23. By comparison, the bill adopted assumes a maximum of 12
weeks, said Mr. Dodd, and he argued that the reduced costs
amounted now to only a few cents a day per worker.

   Lone Star, a Stamford, Conn., cement and construction

part of a continuing restructuring. James E. Stewart,
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement
that the sale of the Tarmac America cumulative preferred
issue and other recent restructuring actions will result in
"the realization of over $325 million, the great majority of
which will be in cash." A spokesman said the preferred resale
was done because Lone Star needs to raise cash.
</LP>

   The company said the buy-back by Tarmac America is at 78%
of the preferred's par value. A spokesman said Lone Star had
been paid the preferred by Tarmac in exchange for some of its
North American operations.
   The transaction is subject to creation of a new class of
preference stock that Tarmac shareholders will be asked to
approve at a special meeting scheduled July 20, Lone Star
said. Tarmac is a British homebuilder and
construction-materials supplier.

   TOKYO -- At least one major Japanese electronics company
has received a request from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
to pay additional taxes, and others are expecting similar
notice soon.
   The U.S. government has long alleged that Japanese
companies are avoiding U.S. taxes by charging their
subsidiaries too much for certain goods, such as
semiconductors and videocassette recorders -- an action that
depresses the stated profits of the American units.
</LP>

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has received a request,
and is "cooperating" with the U.S. government, according to
an official company statement. The company added, however,
that no bilateral standard exists for "transfer prices" and
that the matter was still under discussion between the U.S.
and Japanese governments. A spokesman refused to disclose the
amount of the tax request, or when it was made.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, in Friday's editions, reported
that Matsushita was asked to pay an added 10 billion yen
($64.6 million) in taxes; Toshiba Corp. was asked to pay 30
billion yen more, and Hitachi Ltd. 10 billion yen more.
   The Matsushita spokesman said the figure reported for that
company was "too high." Toshiba officials said they hadn't
yet received any official request, but that they have been
under investigation by the IRS for transfer pricing questions
since 1985. A Hitachi spokesman said the company has been
under investigation since 1986, but that it hadn't received
any requests for additional taxes.
   Sony Corp. said it had received requests for additional
information to the IRS about a month ago, and is still
working to supply the requested material.

   IRVINE, Calif. -- Mission Power Engineering Co., a unit of
SCEcorp., said it terminated its contract for the engineering
and construction of three geothermal power generating plants
in the Coso and China Lake areas of California, which are
owned and operated by California Energy Co., San Francisco.
   "We've just walked off the job," said Jack Adrian, Mission
Power's president and chief executive officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The termination of the contract follows Mission Power's
filing of a lawsuit on June 5 against California Energy and
its partners in the $300 million-plus project. The complaint,
filed in state court in Inyo County, accuses California
Energy of making changes in the scope of the work, triggering
serious delays, and refusing to pay for additional costs.
   Mission Power is seeking more than $79 million in the
action, plus interest and damages for alleged fraud and
misrepresentation by California Energy.
   Michael Heys, California Energy's president, maintained
yesterday that his company has appropriately compensated
Mission Power. "There is nothing due on contractural work,"
he said. "In fact, there has been an overpayment of
$170,000."
   Mr. Heys added that the power plants at the center of the
dispute are "substantially complete" and, therefore, Mission
Power's walkout will not cause "an interruption of
operations."

   Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., one of Japan's largest shipping
companies, is in negotiations to purchase Wassing
Internationale BV, a major Dutch distributing company, a
Mitsui official said this week.
   Mitsui seeks to buy 100% of the company, the official
said, although the purchase price hasn't been disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wassing's business operations in the U.S., Europe and Far
East, including air cargo transport, trucking and inland
cargo transport and warehousing, will be left intact.
   Mitsui is pursuing the deal because it aims to gain a
foothold in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam, which handles a
large amount of European shipping. The move is part of a
strategy to expand in Europe, the official noted.

   FREMONT, Calif. -- Vitalink Communications Corp. said
George Archuleta, chairman, chief executive officer and
president, resigned.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Vitalink plunged
$3.25 to close at $9.625, a 25% loss, making it the biggest
percentage loser on the OTC market for the day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Archuleta also resigned as a director. The company
said he will be succeeded as chief executive by Donald J.
Herman, a director, who will serve until a permanent
replacement for Mr. Archuleta can be found.
   The company gave no reason for Mr. Archuleta's departure.
However, Mr. Herman said the company sees "a reasonable
possibility" that its earnings won't meet analysts' estimates
of between 21 cents and 28 cents a share for its fiscal third
quarter, ending June 30.
   The news of Mr. Archuleta's resignation and Mr. Herman's
forecast combined to batter the stock of the data
communications products firm.
   Several large blocks of Vitalink stock changed hands on
the day. The trading volume was 3.5 million shares.
   Vitalink's stock has been sliding steadily from a 52-week
high of $20.375 in October. Analysts have said that the
company is being hurt by flagging sales under an agreement
with Digital Equipment Corp., which resells Vitalink's remote
bridge products, used to connect local area communications
networks. Analysts say a different product, known as routers,
is gaining favor as a network connector, at the expense of
remote bridges.
   In the six months ended March 31, Vitalink earned $8.8
million, or 62 cents a share, on sales of $36.9 million.

   U.S. Study Denies
   Oil Firms Gouged
   Public Last Winter

   WASHINGTON -- An Energy Department study rebutted
arguments that consumers were gouged by oil companies when
heating fuel prices skyrocketed during last winter's cold
snap.
   The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that
net income at the refining divisions of 10 major oil
companies fell more than 60% from the preceding heating
season. Independent refiners' profits dropped 51% from the
preceding winter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They lost their shirts," said Helmet Merklein, head of
the agency, in an interview.
   After the frostiest temperatures in 60 years hit the East
Coast late last year, heating oil bills in the Northeast
spiked up 55% in December, compared with a year earlier. But
prices began dropping after the December cold snap, and
January was relatively warm. Overall, the average U.S.
household paid $71 more for home fuel oil during the heating
season between October 1989 and February 1990, the report
found.
   Despite price boosts in heating oil and propane, "this did
not translate into a remarkable season for U.S. refineries,"
the report concluded. For the last quarter of 1989 and first
quarter of 1990, which covers the heating season, refiners
had lower profit margins than major U.S. manufacturers on
average, it said.
   The study also didn't find any evidence of
anti-competitive behavior among refiners or marketers eager
to cash in on cold temperatures, as some consumer advocates
and lawmakers had feared, Mr. Merklein said.
   The study was based on financial information filed by
companies this spring with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. It examined returns from refining divisions at 10
major integrated oil companies, which account for 51% of U.S.
refining capacity, and from six independent refiners to gain
a representative view of what was happening in the industry
during the past heating season.
   Refiners and wholesalers which were lucky enough to have
large stocks of heating oil on hand when the cold weather hit
in December presumably enjoyed greater financial returns than
if there had been no cold snap, the study conceded. But
overall, over the October-to-February heating season, higher
prices were more than offset by greater costs and a price
plunge in February.

net earnings for the full year will be considerably higher
than in 1989, barring unforeseen sharp fluctuations of the
exchange rate of the dollar." In fiscal 1989, Ahold earned

   Rap Group Is Under Fire in South Carolina

   The musical rap group 2 Live Crew, already under attack in
Florida for its allegedly obscene lyrics, is now under fire
in South Carolina.
   James Anders, the solicitor, or district attorney, for
Richland County, S.C., ordered 25 local record dealers to
remove the group's album, "As Nasty as They Wanna Be," from
their shelves yesterday. Mr. Anders said a county resident
had complained about the album's lyrics to police, who in
turn brought a copy of the recording to Mr. Anders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's filthy," said Mr. Anders. "You hear nothing {on the
album} but raw sexual filth. It has no socially redeeming
features whatsoever."
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., reached essentially the same conclusion
when he ruled the album to be obscene. The decision resulted
in the arrest of a record store owner who was selling the
album and members of the rap group after a performance
Saturday.
   Telephone calls to the group's office in Miami yesterday
weren't returned.
   South Carolina statutes authorize county solicitors to
determine initially whether a record, magazine or other work
is obscene. Arrests stemming from the decision, said Mr.
Anders, are brought before a state circuit judge. If the
judge also deems the material to be obscene, the case then
goes to a state grand jury and finally is heard by a jury in
the original locale.
   "We're not trying to indict this group," said Mr. Anders,
who has given record dealers 10 days to stop selling the
music. "We just don't want this material on our shelves.
There may be other communities across the country that may
want to have this. But for us, there's nothing {on the album}
that would be of benefit to a juvenile or even an adult."

   JUDGE LAMBASTES IRS for "bureaucratic incompetence."
   In a 10-page opinion, U.S. District Judge B. Avant
Edenfield in Savannah, Ga., ordered an IRS agent removed from
a case involving a convenience-store owner who owed back
taxes. The judge, who had ordered the store seized May 10
after the agent filed an affidavit, vowed never again to
"trust {the agent's} testimony or that of her supervisor."
   The case involved Brenda Stout, a Garden City, Ga., gas
and convenience store owner who was in arrears for 1987 taxes
because of an accounting error. According to Judge
Edenfield's opinion, IRS agent Sherilyn Heyward quoted four
different figures to Mrs. Stout, each one progressively
higher, between September 1988 and May 1989. Mrs. Stout's
bill ultimately came to $96,915.34.
   Each time, Mrs. Stout arranged financing to pay the IRS.
But in December 1989, with $7,532 still owed to the IRS, she
fell into default on a payment agreement with the IRS and put
the store up for sale. According to Judge Edenfield, Mrs.
Heyward tried to freeze Mrs. Stout's bank account, then
sought a seizure order from him last week by claiming,
inaccurately, that Ms. Stout had changed her bank account and
was taking cash from the store.
   When six IRS agents raided the store, according to the
judge, they refused to inform Mrs. Stout and her husband of
their rights, and seized, among other items, $2.46 that
belonged to an employee and $75 that belonged to an
uninvolved party. Mrs. Stout complained to the U.S.
attorney's office in Savannah, which requested a hearing
before the judge.
   "The court heard a story of bureaucratic incompetence,
aggravated by arrogance and hostility toward those the
bureaucracy was intended to serve . . . ," Judge Edenfield
wrote. "While the IRS's actions in this case may not have
been illegal or even contrary to department policy, they were
wrong in the purest sense of the word," he added.
   A spokesman for the IRS apologized for any "perception
that we are rude and arrogant" but declined to discuss the
case. Mrs. Stout's attorney, Harold J. Cronk, called her one
of "the silent majority" of taxpayers who run afoul of the
IRS.
   "We still don't know what she owes," Mr. Cronk said. The
IRS office in Atlanta tallied $6,980, he said, but the
Savannah office came up with $2,617.

   STUDENT'S SUIT OVER GRADES dismissed by state appeals
court.
   The Court of Appeals in New York dismissed the complaint
of a law student who had been ejected from New York Law
School for failing to meet the school's academic standards.
   In its opinion, the seven-judge panel ruled, "As a general
rule, judicial review of grading disputes would
inappropriately involve the courts in the very core of
academic and educational decision-making."
   Susan "M.," as the former student is called in court
papers, had asked a lower court to reinstate her as a law
student. The court dismissed her case but was partially
overturned by New York's Appellate Division, which ruled that
the law school should review one grade she disputed. The
Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled entirely
in the school's favor.
   Jeffrey Trachtman, of the New York law firm of Kramer,
Levin, Nessen, Kamin &amp; Frankel, which represented the school,
said that if judges got involved in the grading process, "you
would have hundreds of cases flooding the court, with judges
called upon to grade papers."
   Deans of nine other law schools had filed
friend-of-the-court briefs supporting New York Law School's
position. Dean David Trager, of Brooklyn Law School, said
that schools have "an interest in policing questions of
grading," but that courts should not be involved.
   Thomas F. Keane, who represented the former student, said
he was dissappointed by the ruling. "The bottom line of it is
that the Court of Appeals is saying that they don't have time
for students," he said.

   A DISPUTE IS BREWING over microwave coffeemakers.
   U.S. District Judge James L. Latchum of Delaware denied a
request by Farberware Inc. to bar Mr. Coffee Inc. from
filling orders for its new microwave coffeemaker, Quick Brew.
   Farberware has alleged in a suit that the overall
appearance and design of Quick Brew is substantially similar
to its MicroBrew microwave coffeemaker and would cause
confusion among consumers. Mr. Coffee began shipping Quick
Brew to retailers last month.
   The microwave coffee market is expected to be increasingly
significant. According to the judge's opinion, 50% of all
Americans drink coffee and 80% of U.S. households contain
microwave ovens.
   Judge Latchum wrote that the two coffeemakers "simply do
not look alike," and that differences in labeling and
packaging made consumer confusion unlikely. A lawyer for
Farberware said the company intends to proceed with the case.

will buy annuities to cover a portion of the benefits
previously provided under the terminated plans for salaried
employees who retired before April 17, 1989, or who were
eligible for pension as of Nov. 8, 1985 even if they retire
after April 17, 1989.

   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it downgraded its debt
ratings for Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co., while
affirming ratings for General Motors Corp.
   The move followed by one day an announcement from Moody's
Investors Service Inc. that it is reviewing the ratings of
$22.28 billion of Chrysler debt for possible downgrade.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The combined amount of debt of all three companies covered
by the S&amp;P move is about $200 billion.
   In separate statements, Chrysler and Ford said they are
"disappointed" with the agency's actions. Both added they are
committed to current spending programs to support future
products, despite financial pressures. GM declined to comment
on S&amp;P's affirmation of its debt ratings.
   Chrysler was hit the hardest of the three auto makers by
S&amp;P's announcement. Its senior debt rating, lowered to
triple-B-minus from triple-B, now is one notch away from
speculative grade, based on S&amp;P's rating system. Moody's
currently rates Chrysler two notches above speculative grade.
   S&amp;P cut Ford's senior debt rating to double-A-minus from
double-A; this cut gives Ford the same senior debt rating as
GM.
   Investors had little time to respond to the news, first
word of which came only minutes before the stock market
closed yesterday. Chrysler fell 25 cents to $15.625 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading; Ford ended unchanged
at $46.375 and GM dropped 37.5 cents to $49.625.
   S&amp;P's action was unexpected, as neither Chrysler nor Ford
was on the agency's CreditWatch list. But Scott Sprinzen,
S&amp;P's vice president of corporate finance said the downgrades
came from "an ongoing reassessment" of the companies.
   Intensifying competition in the North American auto
industry combined with "cyclical softness in domestic auto
demand has resulted in a weakening of earnings and cash flow"
at all of the U.S. Big Three auto makers, S&amp;P said. The
credit ratings service cited "excess production capacity,
proliferation of product offerings and a heating up of price
competition" as factors contributing to the increasingly
competitive environment in the North American market.
   Chrysler is "particularly affected" by these changes
because it has virtually no overseas operations to offset
cycles in North America, S&amp;P said. The agency noted the
company is "aggressively" pursuing cost-cutting opportunities
and has "adequate financial flexibility . . . to meet
near-term" obligations. But longer-term, the auto maker
"faces significant challenges," particularly given its
"already high" debt levels and "heavy capital spending
requirements."
   Chrysler has said it plans to spend some $15 billion over
the next five years on new products; the company's long-term
debt and unfunded pension liabilities stood at roughly $18
billion as of March 31.
   In a statement, Chrysler said it is "deeply disappointed"
with the ratings downgrade, which the company believes "is
not warranted by the facts." Chrysler noted that its spending
program "is on schedule, intact and inviolate," and said
S&amp;P's downgrade of Chrysler Financial Corp.'s commercial
paper rating to single-A-3 from single-A-2 "is inconsistent"
with the financial subsidiary's continuing record
profitability. . . ."
   Chrysler also said the market "readily accepted" a $1.1
billion 30-year bond offering for Auburn Hills Trust
certificates, "expressing high confidence in the company over
a very long term."
   The company had to provide extensive protection to buyers
to support the certificates, however, including a guarantee
that the coupon rate on the certificates would be increased
if Chrysler's debt ratings fall below investment grade.
   Ford also faces challenges, but S&amp;P's Mr. Sprinzen said
the No. 2 U.S. auto maker "is still a very strong company in
our eyes." That partly reflects, the agency noted, Ford's
"strong position" in Europe. Still, that market within a few
years will likely be "increasingly subject to many of the
same problems plaguing the domestic industry," the agency
cautioned.
   In addition, Ford's capital spending over the next five
years will exceed the $23 billion it spent from 1985 to 1989.
S&amp;P said this spending plan raises concerns that the "debt
reduction and replenishment of cash reserves that had been
anticipated in the wake of two recently completed
acquisitions will likely be deferred." Ford spent $2.5
billion to acquire British auto maker Jaguar PLC and $3.4
billion to acquire Associates, a finance and insurance
underwriting company.
   David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president of finance and
treasurer, acknowledged the auto maker's capital spending
program "will use some of our financial capacity, but our
balance sheet is strong and we expect our investments to lead
to further strengthening of our financial condition."
   S&amp;P also cut to double-A-minus from double-A the senior
debt rating for Ford Motor Credit Co., but the agency
affirmed the single-A-1-plus rating on Ford Motor Credit's
commercial paper. Mr. McCammon said Ford's financial group --
which includes the credit company, Associates and First
Nationwide Bank -- provide "an important element of stability
during the period of economic weakness."
   GM's debt rating, which had been lower than Ford's until
now, was downgraded in 1987 to the current double-A-minus
level because of the No. 1 U.S. auto maker's declining share
of the U.S. auto market and the company's need to reduce
costs, Mr. Sprinzen said. But "benefits of new product
development efforts have enabled GM to at least stem the
market share erosion that occurred through the 1980s and its
sales levels have held up relatively well over the past few
quarters," S&amp;P said.

   Senate Approves a Budget Resolution
   For 1991, Seeks Time for Deficit Talks

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate, trying to save face and buy time
for deficit-reduction talks with the White House, approved a
skeleton budget resolution that would cap total fiscal 1991
discretionary spending at 1990 levels.
   The largely procedural measure, approved on a voice vote,
is designed to allow appropriations bills to proceed in both
houses while the budget summit continues. But the proposed
$503 billion cap on would hold spending on defense and
domestic programs $10 billion below the level of the
House-passed resolution, setting the stage for a contentious
conference between the two chambers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials had tried to discourage
Congress from going ahead with appropriations, hoping to keep
pressure on the summit to reach a speedy agreement. But
Democrats and some congressional Republicans insisted. The
administration then sought to keep the spending total in the
Senate measure as low as possible.
   "If we simply put everything on hold right now, we will be
in terrible shape if the summit doesn't come to a
conclusion," said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta (D., Calif.). Progress on appropriations bills, even
if they need to be modified after a summit agreement, "puts
us in a better bargaining position at the summit," he added.
   Next week is shaping up as an important one for the budget
summit, as negotiators hope finally to move from what has
been dubbed "the seminar stage" to discussing
deficit-reduction packages. White House Budget Director
Richard Darman met yesterday with House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who chairs the talks, to schedule
more-frequent meetings beginning next Tuesday.
   Democratic negotiators continue to insist that President
Bush make the first move and put a new proposal on the table.
But they say that Mr. Darman hasn't signaled whether he is
willing to go along.
   Negotiators from both parties said that failure to make
progress soon will be a bad sign. "If we haven't made any
movement by the end of next week," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R.,
Texas), "the odds are we're not going to get anything."
   Rep. Panetta gives it about two weeks. "Most members of
the summit feel that we'll have a pretty good idea by July 4
whether or not we're confident enough to continue to meet,"
he said.
   The Senate maneuvering came as the House Rules Committee
cleared the way for action next week on the first of the
spending bills for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and
approved a resolution setting formal allocations for
appropriations in line with the House budget. In a series of
party-line votes, the Democratic majority rejected plans to
cut $10 billion and $22 billion from budget levels previously
approved by the House. Still, there is sure to be bipartisan
pressure to make at least modest across-the-board cuts when
lawmakers take up the individual appropriations bills.
   Despite the administration's anxiety, the prospect of
spending fights on the floor is welcome to many on both sides
in the chamber. House GOP Leader Robert Michel appears bent
on testing the resolve of his own party's members -- as well
as Democrats -- on the question of budget cuts, and Mr.
Panetta suggested that the appropriations action is needed to
spur on the summit talks. "If you want to put pressure on the
summit," said the Californian, "continue the work of the
House."
   As the majority party, Democrats must preserve some
semblance of a budget process. And however unhappy with the
Senate strategy, the House leadership itself needs time to
advance bills spelling out its spending priorities in this
election year. "What we keep alive is appropriations bills
that reflect our priorities," said a Democratic leadership
aide. "That is the end game."
   The first bill up, providing $20.9 billion for energy and
water programs, would substantially add to President Bush's
budget for cleaning up nuclear-weapons plants and further bid
up funding for solar energy accounts, which would grow by 41%
from fiscal 1990. A $83.6 billion housing, veterans, and
space bill severely pares the White House's costly moon and
Mars initiative, but adds $3.75 billion elsewhere for federal
contributions to assisted housing for elderly and low-income
families.
   Part of the increase is to meet the high cost of renewing
existing leases under the Section 8 housing program. But the
measure also assumes a 45,000-unit increase in the new and
existing subsidized housing above the level that can be
financed by current appropriations.
   Water projects approved by the House Appropriations
Committee include $5 million to accelerate engineering work
and begin real-estate acquisition on the estimated $900
million Olmstead locks and dam project in Illinois and
Kentucky. A group of Michigan universities backed by Rep. Bob
Traxler (D., Mich.) would receive an additional $8 million
from space-related appropriations, while a Treasury and
Postal Service bill of more than $20 billion allocates funds
to assorted hospital and reasearch projects including
Brandeis University in Massachusetts.
   Though House and Senate Appropriations Committees retain
final power in allocating discretionary spending, the normal
budget debate traditionally provides a first test of
Congress's priorities. By shortcutting the process now, the
Senate action would leave even more discretion to its
appropriations panel under former Majority Leader Robert Byrd
(D., W.Va.). Whatever total spending figure is agreed to with
the House, equally important is how it would be divided
between military and domestic accounts.
   The Senate budget resolution calls for $482.5 billion in
budget authority for defense and annually appropriated
domestic accounts, and $503.4 billion in outlays. The
remainder of the $1.2 trillion budget, including spending on
Social Security and interest on the national debt, is
nondiscretionary and doesn't require annual appropriations
bills.

   NEW YORK -- United Telecommunications Inc.'s stock fell in
heavy trading after two analysts cut their earnings estimates
for the long-distance telephone company.
   While the reductions were modest, and the analysts said
they continue to recommend the purchase of United stock, the
price drop underscores investor skittishness over even
marginally negative news about growth companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   United's shares fell $3.25 to $40.875 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading on volume of 4.3 million shares.
The stock's normal daily volume is about 500,000 shares.
   United, which owns the nation's third-largest
long-distance telephone company, US Sprint Communications
Co., wouldn't comment on the estimates, saying it doesn't
project earnings. However, a spokesman said, "We're certainly
comforted that they still consider the stock a strong buy
recommendation."
   "I still think the stock is cheap," said Jack B. Grubman
of PaineWebber Inc., one of the analysts who cut his
estimate. "It's worth in the mid-50s."
   However, he noted that Sprint's rate of revenue growth
from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the first quarter of 1990
was only a little more than 2%. He added that American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has managed to slow the rate at
which Sprint and MCI Communications Corp. have been able to
take away long-distance market share.
   Mr. Grubman cut his second-quarter earnings estimate to 53
cents a share from 57 cents. For all of 1990, he trimmed his
estimate to $2.50 a share from $2.70 a share, and he lowered
his 1991 projection to $3.55 a share from $3.75 a share.
   Joel D. Gross of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. said he
still regards United's stock as a buy.
   "My estimates of $2.50 a share in 1990 and $3.50 in 1991
still show a 40% growth rate," said Mr. Gross. "With the
stock trading at less than 12 times earnings next year that
still looks like a buy . . . to me."
   Mr. Gross had been predicting earnings of $2.64 a share in
1990 and $3.78 a share in 1991. He lowered his estimate for
the current second quarter to 57 cents a share from 60 cents
a share.

   Greenwald's Sign-On Bonus With UAL
   Is the Airline's Biggest, but Not Its First

   UAL Corp. has a history of paying big bucks to attract
executives to its top job.
   When current Chairman Stephen M. Wolf signed on in
December 1987, UAL paid him $5.7 million to cover stock
options he lost when he left Tiger International Inc., in
addition to his $575,000 annual salary at UAL. The company
also paid him $35,000 in relocation fees and $8,000 for
"financial planning." Finally, Mr. Wolf received stock
options for 250,000 UAL shares, now worth considerably more
than three years ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hertz Corp. Chairman Frank A. Olson, who preceded Mr.
Wolf, received a $1 million bonus in addition to a $616,000
salary for serving just six months as UAL's interim chairman
in 1987, as well as serving as chairman of Hertz, a unit of
UAL at the time.
   But the sweetest deal of all is going to former Chrysler
Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, who stands to become
UAL chairman if United's three unions succeed in taking over
the airline. Mr. Greenwald was paid a $5 million fee just to
sign on last month with the union's buy-out effort.
   If the buy-out succeeds, he will receive an annual salary
of $1.2 million for five years in addition to bonuses of $1.2
million a year. The unions also agreed to give him the
equivalent of a 1.5% stake in UAL. If the buy-out fails, Mr.
Greenwald is guaranteed a $4 million fee, in addition to the
$5 million he has already received, and a portion of his $1.2
million salary.
   The unions say they had to compensate Mr. Greenwald for
benefits, including stock options, he lost by leaving
Chrysler. But Mr. Greenwald appears to stand to gain far more
at UAL than he left behind at Chrysler, where he earned $1.1
million last year. That's because the Chrysler stock options
he has received over the past three years were at prices
above the company's current share price.
   "It doesn't seem like he walked away from much at
Chrysler," said Mike Halloran, an executive compensation
specialist at Towers Perrin, a New York consulting firm.
   Mr. Greenwald disputed that he was giving up substantially
less at Chrysler than he was gaining at UAL. He said he and
the unions worked out a compensation plan that took into
consideration what he earned over the past five years at
Chrysler and what he could "reasonably expect to earn in the
next five years" as the probable successor to Chairman Lee A.
Iacocca. He added that any valuation of his stock options now
are invalid because most of the options run for 10 years and
no one can predict what the stock will be worth at a later
time.
   UAL's unions agreed they took into account more than just
the compensation Mr. Greenwald was receiving from Chrysler
before he left. His UAL package, one official said, reflects
"what he realistically was giving up over a five-year
period." As heir apparent to Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca,
Mr. Greenwald was able to argue that his compensation was
likely to increase greatly at Chrysler over the next five
years.
   Mr. Greenwald's retirement package at UAL is also reported
to be far better than his Chrysler plan. Mr. Greenwald will
reportedly receive $750,000 a year after retiring from UAL.
According to this year's Chrysler proxy, when the 54-year-old
executive left the auto maker, his accumulated pension
benefits would have totaled about $250,000 a year. If he had
stayed on the job another five years, he would have received
$500,000 a year in retirement.
   Mr. Greenwald said that in devising the retirement plan,
he took into consideration what his pension would be if he
retired as late as age 65, not what it would be in five
years. He said he would also have been eligible for a
generous supplemental pension plan at Chrysler. However, he
declined to estimate specifically what his pension would have
been at the age of 65 if he had stayed at Chrysler.
   Mr. Greenwald also lost three potential grants of
so-called performance shares when he left Chrysler. The
proxies don't disclose the size or value of those grants,
which were to have been made through 1992. But based on a
reading of the compensation plan's intent, a Towers Perrin
analyst said "it's unlikely" the grants would have totaled
more than $1.5 million.

   Applied Biosystems
   Expects Pretax Loss
   For 4th Fiscal Period

   FOSTER CITY, Calif. -- Applied Biosystems Inc. said it
expects to report a "modest" pretax loss for its fourth
quarter ending June 30.
   It didn't specify the amount of the expected loss. The
scientific-instruments maker said orders and revenue both
have been below expectations. It said it is mulling
"additional measures" to cut costs, but didn't say what those
might be, either.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Applied Biosystems projected in January that it would have
"negative earnings" in its fiscal year, compared with last
fiscal year, when it earned $19.3 million, or $1.38 a share,
on sales of $158.1 million. Still, the news reflects further
tumult at the company.
   The announcement came after the stock market had closed.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Applied
Biosystems' stock fell 25 cents to close at $14.
   That was modest compared with the 38% dive Applied
Biosystems' stock took in January, after the company reported
second-quarter net income swooned 56%. In March, the
company's president and chief executive officer, Irvin D.
Smith, was apparently forced to resign.
   Applied Bioysytems has been hurt by various economic
factors, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, which has
hurt overseas sales. But the company's credibility has also
been hurt by management's earnings surprises for Wall Street;
the second-quarter profit plunge, for example, was reported
just two weeks after management had been telling analysts
that the company was performing well.
   Last year in the fourth quarter, Applied Biosystems had
net income of $4.2 million, or 30 cents a share, on sales of
$36.8 million. For the nine months ended March 30, the
company had net income of $6.7 million, or 48 cents a share,
on sales of $120.2 million.

   Don't Despair -- Middle East Peace Is Still Possible

   American and Israeli officials have finally admitted that
the Middle East peace process is dead. As a result, Secretary
of State James Baker asked the Israelis on Wednesday to set
down their realistic conditions for talking to the
Palestinians. But rather than wait for Israel to move,
Americans can get the ball rolling with some new ideas -- and
here is one.
   Stand back from the details of the Arab-Israeli conflict
and a remarkable symmetry becomes apparent: Palestinians want
from Israel what Israel wants from the Arab states --
recognition and legitimacy. Thus, Palestinians seek
concessions from Israel and Israel seeks concessions from the
Arab states. Conversely, the Arab states try to avoid direct,
public negotiations with Israel and Israel tries to avoid
such negotiations with the Palestinians. This symmetry
suggests a fruitful new approach to the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For over 40 years, Israelis have striven to get the Arab
states to accept first the existence and ultimately the
legitimacy of a Jewish state in Palestine. This central goal
of Israeli diplomatic and military policy has been crowned
with partial success, including a peace treaty with Egypt and
an acceptable working relationship with Jordan. But Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt warned Israel that its actions could "blow
up the peace march and put the whole region on the verge of a
new bloody confrontation," while Saddam Hussein of Iraq
recently threatened that "our fire shall devour one half of
Israel." And the Arab summit just held in Baghdad was the
most bellicose conclave in over a decade.
   In public (in private is another matter entirely), Arabs
insist that Israel must accept a Palestinian state on land
now controlled by Israel. For decades, the Arabs have
resorted to every form of pressure, from terrorism to
diplomacy, to win this acceptance. Here too, some progress
has been made. Israel recognized Palestinian rights at Camp
David in 1978 and the Palestinian cause is the most visible
nationalist movement in the world, winning widespread
sympathy (even in Israel itself). Yet like Israel's quest,
the Arabs' is still unsuccessful. The PLO controls not an
inch of Palestine.
   We see before us a parallelism of failure and frustration:
Israel cannot get what it wants from the Arab states, and the
Palestinians cannot get what they want from Israel. But this
very parallelism potentially offers opportunity. Resolution
of the Arab-Israel conflict in its entirety requires that
both aspirations be addressed, so why not yoke them together?
   As an honest broker, the U.S. government should link
concessions to Israel by the Arab states with Israeli
concessions to the Palestinians. That is, when the Arab
states give Israel something it wants, Israelis should then
-- and only then -- be expected to give something in turn to
the Palestinians.
   Trade-offs can be small or large. If, for example, the
Saudis would end their economic boycott of Israel, Israelis
could increase Palestinian access to underground water on the
West Bank. Damascus might reduce the size of its standing
army by 5% a year; in return, Jerusalem would cease to
establish new Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
When Saddam Hussein signs a peace treaty with Israel, Yasser
Arafat would be invited to Jerusalem. And finally, when all
the Arab states sign peace treaties with Israel, the
Palestinians get their state.
   These are merely hypothetical illustrations, for it is not
possible to predict what actual deals would be cut. It is
possible to predict, however, that the parties would spend
long hours trying to find a just balance. The devil is in the
detail; but that is fine, for hammering out quid pro quos
would be a constructive process, and one that could be
extended to most issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict,
including the compensation of refugees, Arab rights in
Israel, the control of territories and even the disposition
of Jerusalem.
   Everyone would gain. The Arab states achieve what they say
is their main goal, justice for the Palestinians. Israel gets
peace. Palestinians have their state.
   This new peace process bleaches out polemics. Rather than
concentrate on hypothetical intentions (has Mr. Arafat really
accepted Israel? Will the Israelis expel West Bank
residents?), it focuses on practical matters of
give-and-take. It places the burden of the initiative
squarely on the Arab states -- where it should be, for it is
Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad and the other capitals (and not
Israelis or Palestinians) that ultimately decide whether the
conflict continues or ends. If, as many suspect, the Arab
states are not really interested either in peace with Israel
or in a Palestinian state, this process gets that fact out in
the open.
   Above all, this approach helps Israelis and Palestinians
to discover the vital interest they share in common: an end
to the Arab states' hostility to Israel. In the future,
Palestinians would exert pressure on the Arab presidents,
kings and emirs to make concessions to Israel -- and what a
startling change for the better that would be.
   The Israelis have in effect already endorsed this plan. As
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told The Wall Street Journal
earlier this week, "Activity of the U.S. hasn't only to be
concentrated on talks with Palestinians: There has to be
effort also with Arab countries." It is now futile to address
Israeli or Palestinian aspirations in isolation. All the
pieces of the problem have to be wrapped together and dealt
with at the same time. The U.S. government should leave
behind the desultory efforts of past years and try something
with fewer risks and better chances of success.
