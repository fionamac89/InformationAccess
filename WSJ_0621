   OTTAWA -- Canada's gross domestic product rose an
inflation-adjusted 0.5% in the first quarter, led by new
housing construction and consumer spending on durable goods,
Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   The growth was stronger than many economic analysts had
predicted. It followed a 0.6% increase in GDP for the 1989
fourth quarter. GDP is the total value of a country's output
of goods and services.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Inflation-adjusted consumer spending on durable goods
increased 1.5% in the first quarter, and residential
construction activity rose 0.9%. Durable goods are products
such as household furnishings that are considered useful for
at least three years. Business investment in machinery and
equipment was unchanged in the first quarter, after rising
3.3% in the preceding quarter.
   The GDP implicit price index, a broad measure of inflation
trends, rose 0.7% in the first quarter, the same rate as in
the fourth quarter.
   Separately, Statistics Canada reported that manufacturers'
unfilled orders declined in April for the sixth consecutive
month, dropping 1.1% from March. Manufacturers of
transportation equipment and electrical and electronic
products accounted for most of the order backlog decline.
   Manufacturers' shipments declined 0.7% in April, following
two consecutive monthly increases.
   In another report, the agency said Canada's deficit on the
current account of its international balance of payments
widened in the first quarter to 5.08 billion Canadian dollars
(US$4.33 billion) from C$4.66 billion in the 1989 fourth
quarter. The deterioration was blamed mainly on the Canadian
government's decision to forgive debt owed to Canada by some
poor countries. The current account is a financial accounting
of a country's trade in goods and services; it also includes
investment income flows and various other financial
activities, such as transfers of immigrants' funds.

   Once upon a time in 1978 there was an orphan called SIF
(Stock Index Future). SIF was in an orphanage, looking for a
home. The director of the orphanage wanted to place SIF in a
home that would promote his welfare.
   In 1978 two sets of prospective parents came to the
orphanage to inquire about the child. One set was well
established, very wealthy and highly respected in their
community. The family name had been admired in major cities
of the world since 1934. Many people thought Mr. and Mrs. SEC
would be ideal parents for the orphan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, Mr. and Mrs. SEC already had many children of
their own and they were concerned that the addition of one
more child might cause jealousy and friction within the
family. This by itself was reasonable enough, but they went
further. They did not want anyone else to adopt SIF. They
told others that the child was no good. They said that SIF
"fail{ed} to satisfy . . . statutory requirements," would
likely be of "limited utility" and could not meet the "heavy
burden of demonstrating an economic purpose." (Letter from
Irving M. Pollack, Commissioner, Securities and Exchange
Commission, to William T. Bagley, Chairman, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, dated Aug. 21, 1978.) st
   ---
   The other prospective parents were Mr. and Mrs. CFTC. They
were delighted by the child. Although they were not as well
connected socially as Mr. and Mrs. SEC, nor as wealthy, the
entire family worked very hard at good, honest labor.
Frequently they were employed by American farmers, but some
of their younger children had gone into banking and finance,
where most of the SECs' children were employed. Mr. and Mrs.
CFTC were eager to adopt SIF because they could see that he
would be valuable for "hedging on more than an occasional
basis." They recognized that SIF would be a valuable
complement to the products of one of America's most powerful
firms, Wall Street, Inc.
   With Mr. and Mrs. CFTC for parents, SIF grew to be happy
and successful. He moved to the city -- not the same city as
the SECs' home, but a big city nonetheless. The child worked
hard and became accepted by high society and in fact became a
peer or even a rival of some of the SECs' children. Mr. and
Mrs. SEC became jealous and somewhat embarrassed that this
orphan of "limited utility" should compete with their own
beloved darlings. At first they tried to reshape their own
children in a way that could successfully duplicate the
unique attributes of SIF. They tried putting all their
children in a single basket, but that did not work. They
tried other extreme measures, some of which were found to be
illegal.
   ---
   Ultimately, Mr. and Mrs. SEC decided that if the child was
determined to thrive in their society, they must adopt him
for themselves. Supported and even urged on by Wall Street,
they returned to the orphanage and demanded custody of the
child. They said the interest of the child, and society in
general, would be better served if the original adoption were
reversed and SIF were to live out the rest of his life in the
SEC family.
   Mr. and Mrs. CFTC could not understand the SECs' pique
over the success of SIF. After all, the SECs' children had
done quite well since SIF was adopted (although they had had
some ups and downs). Nor could they understand Wall Street's
pique, since its stock had tripled in value since the
adoption of SIF.
   But the SECs continued to lobby the orphanage director.
"We can offer him wonderful advantages and bring harmony to
his life," they said. "We never really meant those silly
things we said in 1978, and will agree to continue to raise
him in exactly the same way the CFTCs have raised him. It
won't be hard to do since the CFTCs have produced a child
care manual and we will follow it carefully. Furthermore,
once the adoption is complete, we are sure others in his
family will want to join him. For several years now we have
had our eyes on his sister, T-Bond Future."

   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- President Bush suspended the U.S.
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization because
of its links to an attempted terrorist attack last month. The
step probably puts any talks on Middle East peace in limbo.
   Mr. Bush was reluctant to call off U.S.-PLO discussions,
which began less than two years ago. Announcing the move at a
news conference while on a speaking trip here, Mr. Bush
declared that the U.S. is ready to resume talks "any time"
the PLO more clearly condemns last month's seaborne assault
on Israel and disciplines those responsible.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And at several points in the news conference, Mr. Bush
stressed the value of the talks the U.S. has held with the
PLO, saying they have "contributed to the peace process" and
have reduced tensions in the Middle East.
   On another pressing foreign-policy issue, Mr. Bush
acknowledged that proposals from France and West Germany for
a big Western economic aid package for the Soviet Union are
likely to be discussed at the meeting of industrialized
nations in Houston early next month. And while he said more
changes are needed in the Soviet system before he could
support an aid package, Mr. Bush indicated he is prepared to
consider the idea.
   "I'm not saying we're not interested," Mr. Bush said. "But
I'm saying there are some formidable obstacles." In
particular, the president said that the U.S. will seek more
market-oriented reforms in the Soviet economy and a
curtailing of the Soviet Union's $5 billion in annual aid to
Cuba before agreeing to any aid program.
   Mr. Bush said he wants the process of change to succeed in
the Soviet Union and said he recognizes "that support from
the West can well help the economy" there. But, he added,
"there's an awful lot of reform that has to take place."
   Mr. Bush insisted that his decision on the PLO dialogue
doesn't have to bring a halt to diplomatic efforts to settle
the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. A few months ago, the Bush
administration thought it had moved close to a breakthrough
in those efforts by finding a formula under which
negotiations could begin between Israel and Palestinian
representatives approved by the PLO.
   But at the last minute, Israel balked at accepting the
formula, and the nation's ruling coalition recently was
replaced by a conservative government more skeptical of peace
talks. Suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue is likely to
freeze any movement by Palestinians toward the negotiating
table as well; most Palestinian leaders profess loyalty to
the PLO and won't enter negotiations without its blessing.
   The immediate danger is that Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip will step up
protests against Israeli rule and bring a harsh Israeli
backlash. For that reason, Mr. Bush stressed in his remarks
his willingness to return to talks with the PLO. And Mr. Bush
balanced his move against the PLO by sending some tough
signals to Israel. He said he had just sent a "long letter"
to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir inquiring about the
new Israeli government's "seriousness about the peace
process." He also reiterated his strong opposition to new
Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Despite Mr. Bush's reluctance to break off dialogue with
the PLO, the weak reaction of PLO leader Yasser Arafat to the
recent attack on Israel appeared to give the president little
choice. When the U.S. agreed in December 1988 to open a
dialogue with the PLO after years of refusing any contact, it
did so only because Mr. Arafat specifically renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   But Abu Abbas, head of a PLO faction called the Palestine
Liberation Front and a member of the PLO's executive
committee, publicly claimed responsibility for the assault by
Palestinian commandos. Mr. Bush said that the size of the
Palestinian commando force and the target area -- a beach
near Tel Aviv -- "strongly indicate that civilians would have
been the target." He called for "steps to discipline Abu
Abbas."

   Tim W. Ferguson's May 22 Business World column attributing
rising health-insurance premiums to use and abuse of
psychiatric care is a grotesque distortion. There is in fact
little evidence that the use of mental-health services is
surging out of control as is being alleged by some
psychiatric managed-care companies, and the data cited by Mr.
Ferguson also do not make the case.
   Let's take two of the items on which he bases his charge:
the Higgins studies and the rise in inpatient admissions over
20 years. First, if the Higgins surveys show anything worth
reporting, it is that very few employers have any data at all
on the cost of psychiatric care in their health plans. The
1988 Higgins survey of psychiatric costs, showing the
much-ballyhooed 27% rise in a single year, had a net response
rate of only 8%. Of the employers that were asked this
question, 82% did not answer, and of the 18% responding, more
than half said they "did not know" what share of total
health-plan costs represented mental-health services.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The National Institute of Mental Health data are correct:
Hospital admission for treatment of mental illness and
substance abuse from 1969 to 1987 rose about 38%. Of course,
the U.S. population during that time also rose 21%, so there
was a net per-capita rise of roughly 17% -- less than 1% a
year. Of this, about a third can be explained by greater
resort to treatment of alcohol and drug abuse.
   In 1969, treatment of chemical dependency was limited
mostly to alcoholic psychosis -- "DTs" -- the most advanced
form of alcohol abuse. Moreover, even this treatment was not
covered by health insurance, so the cost in that period would
not have been noticed in employee health plans. Three
separate studies -- 1971, 1980, and 1985 -- estimated that
the total direct costs of mental illness and substance abuse
ranged from 12% to 14% of all health-care costs.
   The best global estimates do not support the shrill outcry
of the managed-care promoters so frequently echoed by the
journalists they have been able to con.

   Mr. Ferguson's concluding sentence states that ". . .
mental health responsibilities, like much of wellness, are
best handled close to home." What he and most other critics
of mental-health and physical-health expenditures fail to see
is the near-perfect correlation between the major social
changes of the past 50 years and the increased need for
mental-health services. The increased need for
substitute/compensatory institutional services in the form of
medical and mental-health services demonstrates that the
vacuum left by the loss of family and community and economic
instability is being filled by these services. Again we are
reminded that any "progress" will come at some significant
but often unpredicted cost.
   Gerald I. Manus
   Oakland, Calif.
   ---
   One factor not addressed is the public's increased
acceptance of mental conditions and substance abuse as
treatable disorders, a point of view more common on the West
Coast. The success of these facilities is largely a product
of this attitude.
   In both my private practice and position as a hospital
clinical director, I have had to deal with frustrating
financial trends. Currently, inpatient benefits are being cut
back drastically, but with little being done to adjust
outpatient and partial hospital benefits to offset this. And
often, when hospitalization is covered, mental-health
benefits have such limited caps that the insurance will cover
the cost of only a few days' stay, barely enough time to
assess adequately (not treat) a patient. While costs have to
be controlled, let's be balanced in the approach and let's
also accept that there are people who really need these
services. Psychotherapy is not a luxury nor in the same class
as beauty surgery, as Mr. Ferguson implies.
   We need to be realistic about how people coped with mental
problems in the past (and frequently still do). They isolated
themselves, dropped out of school or work, frequently drank,
and became a burden to their family and community. If their
condition became bad enough, they ended up in state
hospitals. Is this what we want to be the future standard?
   Brian R. Johnson
   Clinical Director, Adult Treatment
   CPC Rancho Lindo Hospital

   ---
   Mr. Ferguson's column is an example of what I call
"diseasism." He uses mental-diseasist codewords such as
"shrinks" and "pysch shops," refers to the disorders of
sexual abuse, eating disorders and co-dependency as "voguish
social and personal problems," equates the benefits of
psychotherapy with cosmetic surgery, and refers to therapies
for mental illness as "another burden of modern life {that}
had been made institutional instead of individual."
   Diseasism, like racism or sexism, embodies a set of
attitudes that are pejorative and discriminatory and result
in adverse actions being taken against groups of people just
because of the disease they have. Legislation is a remedy
when the "isms" get out of hand and that is why insurance was
mandated for addictive disorders, as well as for civil
rights.
   Shall we harken back to Mr. Ferguson's good ole days, to
the days of shame and stigma, when alcoholics were denied
treatment in emergency rooms and were jailed, and when
psychiatric patients were hidden behind a family's closed
doors, often resulting in the family's emotional and
financial bankruptcy?
   Cutting all benefits for mental and addictive diseases
would barely put a dent in overall medical costs (about 5% to
10%, according to Mr. Ferguson's data) and would short
circuit a resolution to the nation's health-care financing
crisis. Denying these diseases by not treating them will
result in more serious medical, psychiatric, criminal and
societal problems later on and will magnify health-care
costs.

AIDS opened amid protests against U.S. immigration and health
policies.
   After a night of demonstrations at the Immigration and
Nationalization Service building here and the storming of a
local hotel, protesters yesterday pushed past police lines
into Moscone Center as 12,000 delegates filed in for opening
ceremonies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested about 90 demonstrators associated with the
AIDS activist group ACT UP. Four of the protesters made it
into the giant conference center before they were taken into
custody.
   At a news conference before the opening ceremonies, June
Osborne, chairwoman of the National Commission on AIDS,
expressed "personal horror" at U.S. policy restricting people
with AIDS from entering the U.S. The policy is opposed by the
U.S. Public Health Service, the International Red Cross, the
European Parliament and many national and international
health groups. Many here called on President Bush to end the
curbs.
   "Discrimination is the single greatest enemy of public
health," said Dr. Osborne in remarks prepared for delivery at
the opening ceremonies.
   In a speech aimed as much at the White House as at the
meeting's delegates, Dr. Osborne said bias drives patients --
"our most important collaborators" -- underground, and thus
threatens "the deployment of elegant scientific advances"
that could lead to a cure. No breakthroughs are expected
among the 3,000 research papers slated for presentation over
the next four days, but progress reports on drugs and vaccine
experiments are anticipated.
   Dr. Osborne dedicated her talk to those who were absent --
both casualties of the epidemic itself and of the immigration
policy. To date, the World Health Organization estimates
there are 650,000 cases of AIDS world-wide, with a further
6.5 million people infected by the virus but not yet
exhibiting symptoms of the disease. The U.S. Centers for
Disease Control counts 136,204 cases of AIDS through the end
of May, with an estimated one million Americans infected. The
U.S. death toll now has surpassed 83,145, more than the
combined battle deaths of the Vietnam and Korean wars.
   In a reference to President Bush, who declined to attend
the conference, Peter Staley, an invited speaker from ACT UP,
led the delegates in a chant of "300,000 dead from AIDS --
Where is George?"
   AIDS scholars, meanwhile, proffered hope through research.
"In this decade, we have come a long way in understanding HIV
infection," said Dr. Jay A. Levy, professor of medicine at
the University of California at San Francisco, in a prepared
text.
   "AIDS infection has its long-term survivors," he added,
with 25% of virus-positive people remaining healthy for 10 to
12 years. Research on how the virus enters certain target
cells in the body and how its genes boost the virus's
virulence will offer drug and vaccine designers potential new
points of attack, he said.
   At a related conference across town on combination drug
therapies, members of ACT UP threw leaflets and interrupted
speakers, cutting short a presentation by Jerome E. Groopman
of Harvard University. Dr. Groopman, an AIDS researcher,
asked demonstators to allow him and others to present their
information. When protests continued, he left the stage.
   ACT UP, which has accused researchers of putting too much
emphasis on Wellcome PLC's AZT drug, held a mock trial of
five scientists in the AIDS Clinical Trial Group, which
conducts drug tests in concert with the National Institutes
of Health. "We plan to try them for crimes against gay
people," said Kevin Farrell, an ACT UP member.
   One of the "defendants," Lawrence Corey, a researcher at
the University of Washington, Seattle, was responsible for
findings about low-dose usage of AZT that could curb side
effects and lessen the problem of viral resistance. "I am a
scientist here to attend a meeting," said Dr. Corey. "I have
no comment, please."

   Ministry Isn't Sure
   Japanese Surpluses
   Are Good for World

   TOKYO -- Japan's powerful Finance Ministry is turning sour
on the idea that the country's huge external surpluses are
good for the world.
   Just two weeks ago, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
welcomed an advisory committee report suggesting that Japan
should determine an "appropriate" level for its surpluses.
The committee and others in Japan took the view that
surpluses could help finance the voracious capital appetites
of Eastern Europe and other investment-starved areas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But now, under fire from U.S. officials and rival Japanese
bureaucracies, even the Finance Ministry seems to be cooling
on the "surpluses are good" view. Makoto Utsumi, vice finance
minister for international affairs, said in an interview that
reducing Japan's huge current-account surpluses remains "a
very important pillar" of Japan's economic policies. (The
current account measures trade in merchandise, plus
"invisible" trade that includes services, insurance, tourism
and remittances from workers abroad.)
   Mr. Utsumi insisted that the Finance Ministry had never
explicitly adopted the view that surpluses are good, and he
derided the notion that the ministry was at odds with other
ministries as a "battle of headlines without substance."
There was, he said, "some kind of confusion between the
necessity of savings and the necessity of current-account
surpluses."
   Still, the tone of his remarks differs sharply from the
line pushed by Japanese financial opinion leaders only a few
weeks ago. "I can clearly say that we have no intention to
justify our trade surpluses or current-account surplus," Mr.
Utsumi said. "We feel that we should try our best to further
the adjustment process."
   The retreat on the surplus issue doesn't necessarily mean
that Japan is relaxing its opposition to U.S. demands for
sharply increased Japanese public-works spending. Indeed, Mr.
Utsumi warned against "too much expansion in the public
sector."
   The public-works issue is likely to come to a head again
next week in talks in Tokyo between U.S. and Japanese
officials. U.S. officials argue that increasing public-works
spending would reduce Japan's external surpluses by using at
home capital that currently goes abroad. Mr. Utsumi declined
to comment directly on the talks, but he suggested that he
wants to avoid any commitments that could put Japanese policy
on an inflationary track.
   Refuting arguments that Japan needs to maintain its
surpluses to help capital-starved countries, Mr. Utsumi
argued that Japan can both reduce its surpluses and funnel
capital abroad. He cited figures showing that Japan's
long-term capital outflows in recent years have far exceeded
its current-account surpluses.
   Japan has reduced its surpluses "drastically" in the past
few years, he said, and should continue to do so by pursuing
policies that promote strong "noninflationary growth led by
domestic demand." What Japan should avoid, Mr. Utsumi said,
is a combination of loose fiscal policy and tight monetary
policy.

   LONDON -- Delegates to a world environment conference
appear poised to endorse a global ban by 2000 on
chloroflourocarbons and many other ozone-destroying
chemicals.
   As a ten-day meeting on protecting the world's ozone layer
opened here yesterday, delegates from the U.S., Britain and
other countries expressed confidence that they will reach
agreement on tougher protective measures. Besides the global
CFC elimination, the measures are expected to include
creation of an international fund of at least $160 million to
help developing countries convert their industries to non-CFC
technologies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The measures will take the form of amendments next week to
an international accord negotiated in Montreal in 1987. The
Montreal Protocol committed the world's developed countries
and many developing nations to a 50% drop by mid-1998 in
production and consumption of CFCs and several related
chemicals. CFCs are used widely as refrigerants, industrial
solvents, aerosols and foam-blowing agents. Scientific
research has found the man-made gases are eating away the
atmosphere's natural layer of ozone gas, which helps protect
life on the planet from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.

   I was dismayed by an article in your May 11 Medicine &amp;
Health special report, with the headline "Exercise in
Futility," showing a person inside a wheel of fortune
apparently getting a stress test. A test that is two-thirds
accurate is far from perfect, but it is hardly an exercise in
futility.
   In addition, you overlooked newer developments in testing
for coronary artery disease. Let me give you examples of
noninvasive, safe, painless tests that are as accurate as
catheterization (about 91%) and cost less than half the
amount charged for a catheterization. One is called a
thallium-201 imaging, which actually measures blood flow
through the muscle of the heart. Another test is a
combination of echocardiogram or electrocardiogram with
Dipyridamole, which is especially suitable for people with
impaired mobility or low cardiac reserve.

   Investors Continue
   To Put Their Cash
   Into Money Funds

   Investors continued to pour cash into money-market mutual
funds in the latest week, as yields hardly budged.
   Assets of 431 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report rose by $2.3 billion, to $379.5 billion.
Nearly half the inflow, however, is attributable to four
funds newly listed by the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The average seven-day compound yield, which assumes
reinvestment of dividends, inched up to 7.96% from 7.95% in
the week ended Tuesday. The average had slipped an equal
amount the previous week and has been at or just below 8%
since late January.
   Martha Whittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's, said some of the
money flowing into the funds may have come from the stock
market, which saw a 53.71-point drop in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average Monday.
   Average maturity of the funds' investments, such things as
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs), Treasury bills
and certificates of deposit, lengthened by a day to 44 days.
Average maturity has been 43 or 44 days for 10 weeks,
indicating that a dramatic change in yields isn't expected
any time soon.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
edged up to 7.67% from 7.65%. The average 30-day simple yield
slipped to 7.67% from 7.68% and the average 30-day compound
yield eased to 7.96% from 7.98%.
   Yields on tax-free money funds rose by a tiny fraction of
a percentage point, while assets fell. The average seven-day
compound yield of the 222 tax-exempt funds tracked by
Donoghue's was 5.40%, up from 5.37%. That's equivalent to a
taxable 7.50% for investors in the 28% tax bracket and 8.06%
for those paying 33% in taxes.
   Assets of the tax-free funds declined by $863 million, to
$76.1 billion. Average maturity lengthened by two days to 40
days.

   Enterprise:
   Small-Business Owners Find Vacations Hard to Take
   ----

<LP>
   Ask the typical small-business owner about getting away
for a vacation, and you'll get a laugh -- or a sob.
   "Taking a vacation is a small nightmare," says Deborah
Krabacher, a shopkeeper in Grand Junction, Colo. The first
time she slipped away for two weeks, she sought to assure
customers she hadn't closed for good. She left a sign on the
door and ran radio ads with the message: "See you in two
weeks."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But her strategy backfired. While she vacationed in the
Yucatan, her shop was burglarized. Police weren't
sympathetic; they scolded her for publicizing her absence.
Now when she takes off, a part-timer keeps her shop open, and
she also relies on a security system tied into the police
station.
   Many small-business owners don't take a vacation at all
because it seems such an ordeal. They fear their customers
will evaporate. They're reluctant to trust someone else to
fill in. They convince themselves they're indispensable.
   Small-business owners "always find excuses not to take
vacations -- or, at the last minute, to truncate them," says
John L. Ward, professor of private enterprise at Loyola
University in Chicago.
   Blame the psychic makeup of the typical small-business
owner for that, says Kenneth Kaye, a Chicago psychologist who
counsels family businesses. Individuals attracted to the
long, hard hours that business ownership entails tend to be
anxiety-driven, he notes. They seek to escape that anxiety by
immersing their minds in the minutiae of running a business.
And, he says, they resist taking a break for fear their
anxiety will return.
   But keeping one's nose to the grindstone can hurt the
business. The prolonged stress of fighting distraction,
focusing intensely on dull details and working at protracted
tasks fatigues the mind, says Stephen Kaplan, a University of
Michigan psychologist. The result: a rise in errors, troubles
handling the public, more accidents, and declining
workmanship.
   Jim Stewart, an owner of Stewart-Cooper-Architects, in
Gastonia, N.C., says he works at least 60 hours a week, takes
a rare three-day weekend, and sometimes feels like "a large
raw nerve." "Your morale drops," he says. "You wonder, `What
am I doing?' `I've been doing this for 20 years?'"
   Still, Mr. Stewart can't stop. He's convinced it would
take him a month to unwind completely, and he doesn't buy the
idea that his business would run fine without him. So he
keeps going, even when his overloaded brain causes him to
miss appointments. Last year, he forgot to attend a
ground-breaking ceremony for a church he designed -- and
congregation members have teased him about it since.
   Spouses of workaholic entrepreneurs must use ingenuity to
pry their mates away for a spell. Mr. Ward says some spouses
pre-pay for vacations that carry hefty penalties if canceled.
Since small-business owners typically hate to waste money,
they often feel compelled to go. (Even if they forfeit the
money for themselves, their spouses usually go anyway, he
says.)
   Frequently, though, it takes something extraordinary -- a
heart attack or illness -- to persuade a business owner to
let loose. Last year, Patricia Kavoura, owner of Labyrinth, a
clothing store in Mystic, Conn., was laid up for two months
after fracturing her ankle in an auto accident. She had been
used to working seven days a week, with no vacation.
   That enforced vacation, she says, helped her realize the
store could function without her. She delegated merchandising
tasks, such as making displays, by hiring a once-a-week
contractor. When she returned, "I felt rejuvenated. I was
nicer to people," she says. She has retained the contractor,
trimmed a day or two off her workweek, and now tries to take
a week or so off several times a year.
   Yet, to some small-business owners, even a day away may
seem too costly. Lynn and Doug Kowaleski, who own BelAir
Colonial Funeral Home in Madras, Ore., can go for weeks in
their business without getting a call to handle a death. But
missing just one call can mean lost revenues averaging $1,780
that could go to their more entrenched local competitor.
   So, the Kowaleskis consider themselves on call 24 hours a
day, year-round. If they get away for a day, they switch
their calls to a funeral home in another town, keep in touch
by a CB radio, and rush back whenever a call comes in. Ms.
Kowaleski admits that funeral work is "a real burnout --
stressful kind of business," but adds that "people are
depending on {us}."
   Operating cycles in a small business can also complicate
vacation plans. Rick Sheridan, who runs a neon lighting
company in his Des Moines, Iowa, home, often gets a contract
at the last minute that forces him to stick around while his
wife, a travel agency manager, goes ahead with their
pre-booked vacation. This year, he expects to complete a
large installation at a local hotel in time for a three-day
jaunt with his wife to Las Vegas.
   But the project required him to pour all his capital into
it. He won't be paid until after the couple returns from
vacation, so he must borrow $1,000 for spending money.
   To some small-business owners, any time away is better
than nothing. Lee Hubert and her husband have taken little
time off in the 16 years they've run Ted's Electric, a motor
sales-and-repair shop in Chico, Calif. But, married for 35
years, she knows that when her husband smokes more than
usual, he's due for a respite. She urges him to go off with a
buddy on one of their occasional one-day gambling trips to
Reno. He takes $50 with him, blows it, and relaxes by telling
her all about it when he gets back.
   Ms. Hubert herself hasn't been away long by herself,
except to visit ailing relatives. But she vows within five
years to take her dream vacation: two weeks in New Orleans,
with paddle-wheeler rides and plantation tours.
   Enduring the small-business grind with no letup clearly
isn't for everybody. Reza Manafi bought a Subway Sandwiches
franchise in Albany, Calif., four years ago, expecting to
open five more within two years, hire people to run them,
then take it easy.
   But he found that operating one outlet sapped his energy.
He hasn't expanded, and he claims he can't find enough
reliable help to get away for more than 72 hours.
   "It's just work, work, work and no play," he says, "and I
don't like it." He's put his franchise up for sale.

   SMITH INTERNATIONAL Inc., a Houston-based energy services

plan, it will distribute as a dividend one preferred-stock
purchase right for each common share held. The rights expire
June 19, 2000. The company said each right, when exercised,
entitles the holder to purchase 1/100th of a newly issued
share of Series A junior participating preferred at an
exercise price of $50. The rights become exercisable if a 20%
ownership stake in the company is acquired, among other
conditions. A spokeswoman said adoption of the plan wasn't a
response to any known takeover threats. Rights plans can be
used as a defense against a hostile bid by making an offer
more expensive.

   I couldn't help but laugh as I read about the difficulty
of persuading the public to use debit cards and merchants to
install point-of-sale terminals so they can be used (Law, May
9: "Cashless Society May Be Inching Toward Reality").
   You see, the future is now in Iowa. Every ATM in the state
is connected through a single central switching system, so it
makes no difference whose card you've got when you want to
use a point-of-sale terminal or just get some cash from an
ATM.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thanks to this universality, ATMs are everywhere and
point-of-sale terminals are to be found in both large and
small grocery stores. Need some cash? Just hit the nearest
"money machine" or get that extra $10 or even $50 with your
grocery purchase with no thought about which bank has the ATM
or which is "your" bank.
   It's easier than writing a check. No photo driver's
license or other form of identification is required and the
store's limit on cash back may be higher than for a check.
   There is one slight catch, but it affects only
"foreigners." The Iowa network is connected to Cirrus, so
pack your Plus System card away as you cross the state line
and bring plenty of cash with you unless you've also got a
Cirrus Card.

   Chrysler Financial Faces Tight Credit
   After Downgrade Despite Record Net

   SOUTHFIELD, Mich. -- What happens to a financial-services
company that posts six straight years of record earnings
while maintaining a conservative lending approach?
   If the company is part of Chrysler Corp., it gets thrashed
by credit-rating services and finds its access to key credit
markets for raising cash diminished.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. cited long-term
uncertainties in Chrysler's automotive business when it
downgraded the company's credit rating to triple-B-minus, one
notch above speculative grade. Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said it also may downgrade Chrysler debt because of similar
automotive concerns.
   But Chrysler Financial Corp. will suffer the most from the
ratings change, even though it has had a standout record in
recent years, and will be a far larger profit center for
Chrysler this year than car and truck manufacturing.
   "This downgrading means our borrowing costs are higher and
our profits will be lower," says John P. Tierney, chairman of
Chrysler Financial. Already, his company has had to dip into
about $12 billion in standby bank credit, a more costly
source of funds that was previously arranged to cover just
such an emergency as this.
   Still, Mr. Tierney is projecting record earnings for the
second quarter (partly because the downgrading occurred too
late to have much impact) and "a very good third quarter."
   During its six straight record years, Chrysler Financial's
earnings surged nearly fourfold largely because the auto
maker diversified the unit into businesses besides making
loans to car buyers and dealers.
   Because of that push, Chrysler Financial now gets 44% of
its results from operations that have nothing to do with
Chrysler or the auto industry, including mergers financing
and rail-car leasing. Meanwhile, its earnings have steadily
climbed the past four years while earnings from the finance
arms of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have slipped.
One reason is that Chrysler Financial has kept a more
conservative approach to its consumer auto lending. At the
end of March, 0.69% of Chrysler Financial retail auto loans
were delinquent compared with a 2.06% industry average rate.
   What's more, last year Chrysler Financial's net income of
$284 million accounted for nearly 80% of Chrysler's overall
earnings. The results, contends Mr. Tierney, suggest that
Chrysler Financial didn't deserve a lower credit rating.
   S&amp;P, though, reasoned differently. It acknowledged that
Chrysler Financial's "performance has been very good and its
asset quality remains sound." But S&amp;P added: "The credit
quality of Chrysler Financial is ultimately a function of its
parent company." Thus, besides lowering Chrysler's long-term
debt rating, S&amp;P lowered its rating on Chrysler Financial's
$7.5 billion of commercial paper to the bottom of the scale:
single-A-3 from single-A-2.
   Commercial paper, essentially an unsecured corporate IOU,
is crucial to Chrysler Financial. Unlike a bank, the company
doesn't get deposits. So it raises money by selling debt, and
then turns around and lends the money to buyers of Chrysler
vehicles, to Chrysler dealers and to a range of other
business borrowers.
   For Chrysler Financial, having its credit rating dropped
just one notch was critical. Investors who buy commercial
paper are jittery these days about the quality of debt that
far down on the rating scale. And many money-market mutual
funds are restricted from buying any commercial paper rated
that low.
   As a result, the market for Chrysler Financial commercial
paper is now merely one-tenth as large as before the rating
change, says Mr. Tierney. Thus Chrysler Financial has turned
to more expensive sources of funds.
   A typical interest rate on the standby bank credit,
Chrysler Financial says, will run about 8.45% compared with
the 8.30% it paid on commercial paper borrowings. "That may
not seem like the world's biggest difference," Mr. Tierney
says. "But it quickly adds up to make a difference."
   The company also had to pay higher rates on $300 million
of two-year notes sold to the public just after the ratings
action. And $100 million in Chrysler Financial notes that
Shearson Lehman Hutton planned to sell to its retail
customers was held up because of the debt-rating cloud.
   Chrysler Financial is trying to cope in other ways. For
instance, it is packaging more auto loans to consumers and
wholesale loans to dealers for resale on securities markets.
That way, the company can reduce its reliance on commercial
paper debt. So far this year, Chrysler Financial has sold
$5.4 billion of the loan receivables compared with $4.8
billion for all of last year.
   Despite the scrambling for new sources of funds, Mr.
Tierney says Chrysler Financial hasn't faced a liquidity
problem. Fitch Investors Service Inc. agrees. On Tuesday, the
debt-rating agency stated that with the "combination of bank
borrowings, asset-backed securities sales and continued
rollover of maturing commercial paper . . . Chrysler
Financial shouldn't face a liquidity crisis." Nonetheless,
Fitch placed Chrysler Financial's long-term debt on watch
status.
   "It's a real dilemma they face and it's an unfair one,"
says Harald Gundersen, portfolio manager with Ivy Money
Market Fund in Hingham, Mass. Referring to the parent
company, which is beset by sagging earnings and slumping
market share, Mr. Gundersen adds: "It is like guilt by
association."

   In regard to Lee Yee's June 4 editorial-page story ". . .
But Meantime, Hong Kong Braces for a Fall": Mr. Lee realized
there is an analogy to today's situation in Hong Kong, but it
is a far darker analogy than a ship heading toward a volcanic
isle. With adult children abandoning their elderly parents,
lovers deserting each other in search of a partner with
travel papers, a community rampant with desperate greed in
order to buy oneself a way out, what the current frenzy in
Hong Kong most closely resembles is the terror of the Jews in
the Warsaw Ghetto.
   During World War II the Jews of the ghetto faced with
resettlement in the East found themselves hopelessly trapped
by an uncaring world. For the Chinese of Hong Kong, it looks
as if "never again" has come again too soon.

   Fortune Smiles, but Let's Hope
   They Don't Rename the Town

   Gold Hill is a tiny town in southwest Oregon that boomed,
then faded, after miners discovered a mother lode of gold in
1860. Now the town has discovered another mother lode, a
treasure-trove that's being mined to defray city expenses.
   For fear of claim jumpers, the site of the new strike is
known to only a handful of city employees. And for good
reason. The stuff is lying in mounds on the floor of a cave
on city property, so intruders could easily make off with
bags full.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gold Hill is mining bat guano, packaging it in city hall,
and selling eight-ounce bags of the nitrogen-rich manure for
$5 each and one-ounce bags for $1. The deposit was discovered
a month ago by a city employee, and Mayor Jay DeYoe, who has
a reputation for ingenious marketing, soon saw the
possibilities for raising cash for the financially strapped
town.
   The proceeds have been modest, about $100 so far. But that
helps pay for four part-time police officers. Demand is
steady for the rich fertilizer, and supply is no problem. "If
we run short at city hall, why we just go back and get a few
buckets more," says Mayor DeYoe.
   He's trying to boost sales by attaching a bat logo to each
bag, and the police chief sports a bat on his uniform as
well.
   Mining bat guano isn't the mayor's first unusual venture.
He patented "Dirt Bags," oversized plastic river rafts
stuffed with Styrofoam peanuts. Mr. DeYoe says the latest
venture has prompted area residents to start calling him
Mayor Guano. That's an improvement. "I kind of like it," he
says. "They used to call me Dirt."
   Every bit of loose change helps in Gold Hill. The gold
mine played out after eight months, and times have been tough
for the past 130 years. The town's only recent new
enterprises have been two blackjack parlors and a topless
bar. Citizens are eagerly awaiting construction of a new bank
because the current one is housed in a mobile home. People
worry "because somebody could back {a car} up to it, hitch it
up and just take it away," says Kathy Caruso, the
receptionist at city hall.
   For a town whose mayor sells dirt bags, boasts of a
"vortex" house with a strange magnetic field that makes balls
appear to roll uphill, and town-limit signs that contradict
each other (one says pop. 965 and the other 935), selling bat
guano at city hall doesn't seem out of character.
   "Everybody in Gold Hill is kind of strange anyway,"
observes town historian Linda Genaw.

   Fed Reports Weak Economy in Most
   Regions of U.S., With Credit Tightening

   WASHINGTON -- Economic activity continues to be weak in
most regions of the country, with new signs of constraints in
credit, according to a Federal Reserve report.
   The construction industry is particularly frail, the Fed
said, and the credit squeeze is concentrated in real estate.
The Fed, in a report on a survey of the 12 regional reserve
banks, also noted weakness in retailing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its previous survey of regional economic conditions,
conducted in March and April and released in May, the Fed
noted some tightness in real estate credit in the Northeast,
but said it saw little evidence of a widespread credit
crunch.
   In the latest report, which will help guide officials of
the central bank when they meet to set policy July 2 and 3,
both the Richmond Fed and St. Louis Fed, covering sizable
portions of the Midwest and East Coast, reported tightening
of credit in their districts. Economists at the San Francisco
Fed found that "lending standards have become more stringent
in recent months." Home builders around New York City and
northern New Jersey are finding that a shortage of credit for
acquisition and construction is "becoming a major problem."
   While the tightening in credit seems to be limited to real
estate, the Fed said, "limited information suggests small
business firms in some areas may be affected."
   Evidence has mounted over the past several months that
banks, reacting to pressure from regulators and the soft
economy, have become increasingly cautious in lending to
small and midsize businesses. This has been particularly
apparent in the real estate industry, one of the weakest
areas of the economy. Economists and government officials
have been watching the situation carefully, out of concern
that the economy could stall if credit becomes too scarce.
   The Fed survey doesn't suggest that credit conditions are
reaching such a serious stage. In Cleveland, the squeeze is
limited to borrowing for commercial buildings and large
residential structures, according to the survey, while there
appear to be ample funds for single-family housing. Weak loan
demand in Atlanta has driven banks to encourage borrowing.
   Generally the report sketched a picture of an economy that
is sluggish in most areas of the country, with little
evidence of change in the inflation rate.
   The following is a summary of activity in each of the Fed
districts:
                                                                                                       

   Boston. (The Boston bank covers Massachusetts, Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and most of Connecticut.)
Many retailers report flat or declining sales and high
inventories. Manufacturers are doing a bit better; sales and
orders are generally running above last year's levels and
inventories are in line. Job losses are expected to mount
through the end of the year, and no significant job growth is
expected before 1992. The battered construction, finance and
real estate industries probably won't turn around until 1992,
a regional research firm predicts.
                                                                                                       

   New York. (New York state, northern New Jersey and
Fairfield County, Conn.) Office vacancy rates in Manhattan
have reached their highest level in two decades, but they
have stabilized elsewhere in the region. Unemployment remains
below the national average. Nevertheless, General Electric
Co.'s aerospace division is planning to eliminate 4,200 jobs
over the next 2 1/2 years, responding to drops in defense
spending. Half of the losses will be in upstate New York. But
a new GE electronics-parts plant outside Binghamton, N.Y.,
will bring 500 new jobs to the area.
                                                                                                       

   Philadelphia. (Eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern
New Jersey.) Manufacturers here believe their yearlong
decline may be leveling off. Consumers don't seem to be
spending freely; rather they are shopping for the best price
and quality of goods for which they feel "relatively urgent
need." Loan growth continues, although a slowdown appears to
be developing. The reason is mostly a drop in demand.
Commercial and residential construction continues to decline.
                                                                                                       

   Cleveland. (Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky
and northern West Virginia.) Many firms here are increasing
capital spending. Multinational companies are finding
overseas markets remain generally strong. Major retailers say
May and June sales have been disappointing. The culprits are
cold and rainy weather, slowing income gains and competition
from discount chains. Credit standards have tightened but
"ample funds" are still available outside real estate and
highly leveraged transactions.
                                                                                                       

   Richmond, Va. (Virginia, Maryland, North and South
Carolina, District of Columbia, most of West Virginia.)
Retail sales are flat, and manufacturing is softening a bit.
Tourism has been mixed. Home sales are generally steady, but
housing construction is down. Demand for business loans
decreased slightly in May, while applications for home-equity
loans grew in many regions.
                                                                                                       

   Atlanta. (Georgia, Alabama, Florida, eastern Tennessee,
southern Mississippi, southern Louisiana.) Sales of
appliances and other durable goods are declining, reflecting
the weak housing market. Auto sales have also weakened
further, dealers report. Manufacturing activity is picking up
in many sectors, but the auto and textile industries remain
sluggish. Overbuilt markets and stringent lending conditions
are hurting the construction industry. Many banks see weak
consumer loan demand. Employers report little change in wage
and price pressures.
                                                                                                       

   Chicago. (Northern Illinois, Iowa, lower peninsula of
Michigan, most of Indiana, southern Wisconsin.) Manufacturing
is beginning to improve, while construction and retail sales
are weakening. Bad weather in May and early June damaged
crops and slowed planting. Plans for some large construction
projects in Chicago are being pushed back, but so far few
have been canceled.
                                                                                                       

   St. Louis. (Eastern Missouri, Arkansas, western Kentucky,
western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, southern Illinois,
southern Indiana.) Many of the biggest commercial banks have
tightened standards for loans to small and medium-size
businesses. Excessive rainfall has damaged crops and delayed
planting. A growing number of retailers are reporting larger
than desired inventories. Defense cutbacks are beginning to
be felt. The pending scale-back of a military base in
Kentucky has brought a decline in retail sales and a rise in
the inventory of unsold homes in the area. A cut in military
orders led to a sharp drop in production at an Illinois shoe
factory. Makers of building materials, however, are
benefiting from an improvement in the Texas economy.
                                                                                                       

   Minneapolis. (Minnesota, Montana, North and South Dakota,
northern Wisconsin, upper peninsula of Michigan.) Conditions
here have been "moderately good" lately, though there are
signs of softening. Employment growth is low and retail sales
growth is slowing. Car sales are particularly soft. Housing
sales are still quite strong, but housing construction is
weak. Manufacturers of scientific and medical instruments
report vigorous growth. But electronics firms in the
Minneapolis area are having troubles. Defense suppliers
report drops in orders and production. Forest-product and
mining industries are doing well.
                                                                                                       

   Kansas City. (Western Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, northern New Mexico.) Thrifts
report weak mortgage demand but banks say loan demand is
steady or rising. Plentiful spring rains seem to have brought
an end to the region's two-year drought. Both retailers and
manufacturers are trying to trim inventories. New home sales
are slow.

   Dallas. (Texas, northern Louisiana, southern New Mexico.)
Oil equipment sales are accelerating. Electronics and
computer firms say their sales are increasing after a slump
late last year. Although retail sales are slowing, many
national chains say sales in the region are outperforming the
national pace. Service firms report some growth in demand.
Construction remains weak. Business construction contract
values have risen slightly but remain well below levels of
late last year. Although oil prices have fallen, the energy
sector of the region's economy is expanding.
                                                                                                       

   San Francisco. (California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho,
Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii.) This is still the
healthiest region in the country. Nevertheless, business
leaders expect slow growth over the next year. Capacity
constraints are limiting commercial aircraft production.
Several defense firms have announced layoffs recently, but
they hope "the strength of commercial aviation, as well as
possible increases in NASA funding" will bring continued
business. Conditions are healthy in most Western real estate
markets. Despite widely publicized problems in Arizona real
estate markets, home prices there have remained relatively
stable. Arizona banks, however, will only lend to builders
with "excellent records and significant equity." Car dealers
in the region are concerned about tightening credit criteria.

   VALHI Inc., Dallas, has withdrawn its proposed public
offering of $100 million in convertible subordinated
debentures due 2015, citing unfavorable market conditions.
The preliminary prospectus was offered May 31, but a
subsequent 10-day road show "generated significant interest,
but not at terms acceptable to us," a company executive said.
Valhi, a holding company controlled by Dallas billionaire
Harold Simmons, planned to use the proceeds to accelerate
repayment of debt maturing in 1994. But last week Moody's
Investors Service Inc. assigned a single-B-3 credit rating to
the proposed debentures, saying its assessment of the
proposal included its junior subordinated position and the
superior position of hefty debt at the operating subsidiary
level.

   SCA of Sweden
   Agrees to Buy
   Reedpack Ltd.

   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's Svenska Cellulosa AB agreed to
acquire British forest products concern Reedpack Ltd.,
continuing the spate of recent takeovers sweeping Europe's
pulp and paper industry.
   SCA agreed to pay #543.9 million ($937.4 million) for
Reedpack's fully diluted share capital and will assume #500
million in debt. Reedpack was formed two years ago in a #610
million management buy-out of Reed International PLC's
European paper, packaging and office supplies operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   SCA's offer is nearly triple the #210 million in equity
and preference capital injected by management and
institutional investors under the buy-out -- Britain's
biggest management buy-out to date. Reedpack directors
unanimously recommended the offer and irrevocable acceptances
have been received from investors representing 75% of
Reedpack shares outstanding, the companies said.
   The transaction remains subject to shareholder approval,
as well as an antitrust review by U.K. authorities. British
officials raised no objections during preliminary contacts,
SCA said. To facilitate the antitrust review, the company
agreed to sell its minority stakes in two U.K.-based
packaging ventures to their controlling owner, Jefferson
Smurfit Group PLC.
   SCA Chief Executive Sverker Martin-Loef said the big
Swedish forestry group had been a suitor when the Reed
operations were spun off in 1988 but was outbid by the
buy-out group.
   The acquisition would strengthen SCA's position as one of
Europe's biggest producers of corrugated packaging products
-- and make the Swedish concern a major producer of newsprint
using recycled waste paper as raw material.
   SCA said interest costs for the debt-financed acquisition
will dilute per-share earnings this year, but Mr. Martin-Loef
predicted that gradual synergy gains -- plus effects of
substantial capital investments made by Reedpack during the
past two years -- would add about 10% to SCA's previous
projection of per-share earnings in 1992.
   Swedish investors seemed to approve of the marriage. SCA's
B-free shares, the series most traded internationally,
climbed one krona to 115 kronor in moderately heavy trading
on the Stockholm Stock Exchange yesterday.
   But some analysts questioned the acquisition's high price
-- a multiple of 20 times Reedpack's fiscal 1990 earnings --
and warned that SCA's 1990 pretax profit could plunge by as
much as 20% as a result.
   "This shows that companies are prepared to pay exceptional
prices to achieve market positions, size and long-term growth
in European pulp and paper, though markets probably will
soften for the next two or three years," said forestry
analyst Stephen Weller at London securities firm UBS/Phillips
&amp; Drew.
   Swallowing Reedpack would increase SCA's annual sales by
about 25% to an estimated 33 billion Swedish kronor ($5.44
billion).

   Friday night in Westhampton, Long Island. The crowd files
into the movie theater, buzzing in anticipation over "Dick
Tracy." The lights dim. All eyes turn to the screen. And then
-- commercials for Diet Coke and American Express.
   What's wrong with this picture?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Dick Tracy" is a Walt Disney release. That's the same
Disney that trumpeted its new policy, as of March, to ban
theaters from running ads before its pictures. Yet here at
the Hampton Arts theater in New York, and at dozens of other
theaters owned by Cineplex Odeon across North America,
commercials run before every showing of the Disney flick. Ads
air before Disney's "Pretty Woman," too. In all, Cineplex
Odeon is showing Disney films on 170 of its more than 1,550
screens, and isn't banning ads on any of them.
   Disney and its competitor Warner Bros., which has a
similar ad-ban policy for its films, are finding that grand
proclamations are one thing, but enforcing an ad ban in movie
theaters is something else altogether. The problem is that
theater chains such as Cineplex Odeon have long-running
contracts with advertisers, contracts that will last for
months or even years to come. "We can't force people to break
contracts," says a Disney spokeswoman, and "we've got to play
some Cineplex houses because there's so many of them."
   The upshot: the Disney and Warner ad bans may not look
like bans at all to the average man on the street.
   Cineplex isn't the only chain showing ads before Disney
and Warner pictures. Cobb Theaters, a Southern chain based in
Birmingham, Ala., with 300 screens, is doing it as well.
Cobb, too, had pre-existing agreements with advertisers. But
Cineplex, with over 1,550 screens, is the largest player
running the ads. Aside from the commercials it runs before
various Disney releases, it also allows ads before the Time
Warner films it is showing on some 230 screens, including
"Gremlins II" and "Driving Miss Daisy."
   The ads promise to be around for a long while. A
spokeswoman for Cineplex, based in Toronto, declines to say
how long the theater chain's contracts with advertisers run,
but says: "There certainly is some time to go on certain
contracts. We aren't talking about something that would
disappear almost immediately." Advertisers say such contracts
typically run several years. Cobb executives declined to
comment.
   The Disney spokeswoman says a number of other theater
owners were able to renegotiate agreements with advertisers
and to pull ads from Disney releases. For those that are
still running ads because of pre-existing contracts, the
spokeswoman says Disney hopes that the contracts won't be
renewed. "We would hope the theaters think twice about
showing advertisements at all," she says. Warner executives
couldn't be reached.
   Advertisers, though, say they have no plans to leave show
business, not as long as they can still see their ads on the
silver screen. Their contracts with such chains as Cineplex
have put them in a position where they barely have to think
about the Disney and Warner ad bans. "Right now," says a
Coca-Cola spokesman, "we have to view it for us as business
as usual."
   Although he won't speculate on what will happen after
Coke's contract with Cineplex expires, the spokesman says:
"As long as theater owners provide us an opportunity to
advertise in their chains, we will continue to evaluate that
and take advantage of it. We view theater advertising as an
effective form of advertising."
   The Cineplex spokeswoman declined to comment on how the
chain will entice such current advertisers as American
Express, Coke and the Los Angeles Times to stay on after
their contracts expire, if Disney and Warner films are no
longer part of the ad package. The movie chain is faced with
a touchy situation.
   "We have good relationships with all the studios,
including those who have said they're opposed to screen
advertising, and we intend to continue those good relations,
so we will accommodate things they feel firmly about," the
spokeswoman says. But, she adds, "Obviously, we have a
difference of opinion. Cineplex believes {screen advertising}
is appropriate and can be entertaining."

   RJR's `Mr. Fit' Ads
                                                                                                       

   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco agreed not to run ads that,
according to the Federal Trade Commission, misrepresented the
findings of a government study on smoking.
   In 1986, R.J. Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco, ran a
series of print ads, one of which discussed a study funded by
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The ad claimed
that the institute's so-called "Mr. Fit" study provided
scientific evidence that smoking isn't as hazardous as the
public had been led to believe.
   In a complaint filed in June 1986, the FTC claimed that
the ads misrepresented the study's findings. The FTC said
that R.J. Reynolds, among other things, failed to disclose
that the men in the study who quit smoking had a
significantly lower rate of heart disease than men who
continued to smoke.
   Under the settlement, R.J. Reynolds agreed not to
misrepresent in future ads the purpose or results of the
study. A spokeswoman for the company said that R.J. Reynolds
still believes that the ad didn't distort the report's
findings. But she added that the company agreed to the
settlement because of the length and the cost of the
litigation.
   "We decided to accept the settlement and put the matter
behind us," she said.

an agreement with the Independent Television Association that

Saatchi's financial troubles.

   Democrats Critical of Plan
   To Reduce 1991 Deficit
   By About $50.5 Billion

   WASHINGTON -- The White House put forward a new proposal
to shrink the fiscal 1991 budget deficit by about $50.5
billion, but Democrats immediately began sniping at the plan
and said it wasn't sufficient to move the budget summit
forward.
   Although House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.)
emerged from the closed-door talks saying that "today
succeeded in starting serious negotiations," other Democrats
were far gloomier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.)
called the Bush administration's proposal "a new suit on that
old corpse," while Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen (D., Texas) termed it "a very inadequate reply." And
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.),
among the Democrats most eager to find a deficit-reduction
compromise, said, "It's a start, but it makes for a very
difficult start."
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who won't
provide a written version of the proposal until today,
clearly hoped it would break the logjam that has paralyzed
the budget summit since it began in mid-May. His hopes don't
appear to have been realized. After listening to Mr. Darman's
plan yesterday, one Democrat told him, "It's so inadequate
you couldn't even respond to it," a participant at the talks
said.
   After Democratic negotiators caucused, Sen. Sasser said
there was a "general recognition that it would be almost
impossible to use as a negotiating document."
   The new $50.5 billion deficit-reduction plan builds on
proposals in President Bush's January budget that, by the
administration's new figuring, would have reduced the fiscal
1991 projected deficit by $40.5 billion, congressional
sources said. It calls for no new revenues or user fees
beyond the $20 billion outlined in the January budget.
   The plan would cut projected spending on entitlement
programs, such as the Medicare health-care program for the
elderly, by about $17 billion, compared with $14 billion in
the January budget. Mr. Darman listed a host of new
money-saving changes to entitlement programs, such as forcing
drug companies to cut prices paid by Medicaid, the
health-care program for the poor, and further trimming
federal employee health benefits.
   The administration also cut projected defense spending by
$5.9 billion, compared with a $2.3 billion cut proposed in
January. And it would cut so-called domestic discretionary
spending, programs for which Congress appropriates money
annually, by about $4 billion, compared with the $500 million
in savings outlined in January.
   "It is the beginning," Rep. Gephardt said. "We have a
long, long way to go."
   New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, the senior Republican on
the Senate Budget Committee, said the proposal by Mr. Darman
would reduce the deficit by $440 billion to $444 billion over
the next five years. "It is a good starting point and will
permit us to proceed with serious negotiations," he said.
Democrats predicted that the Congressional Budget Office will
estimate the savings to be much less.
   The new plan came as the congressional and White House
budget offices increased their estimates of the budget
deficit for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. Mr. Darman's
new numbers indicate that if the budget summit fails,
across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law could be as large as $95 billion this
fall -- even if Congress agrees to exclude spending on the
savings-and-loan bailout.
   The White House Office of Management and Budget surprised
congressional summit participants by saying it now puts the
1991 deficit at $158 billion, $20 billion more than the $138
billion estimated just a month ago and far larger than the
January forecast of $100.5 billion. The Congressional Budget
Office said the red ink will swell to $162 billion, compared
with the $131 billion it estimated in March.
   These latest numbers don't include the cost of paying for
the S&amp;L bailout. If the S&amp;L costs are counted, the OMB said
the fiscal 1991 deficit would total between $200 billion and
$222 billion, while the CBO put the deficit at $232 billion.
   "The point is the problem is getting worse," Sen. Sasser
said.

by four shareholders, who will receive all the proceeds;
these holders include Chairman William B. Ruger Sr., who sold

   Governments' Woes Signal Bargains in Tax-Exempts

BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)
</IN>
<LP>
   The mounting financial woes many state and local
governments face these days could mean opportunity for shrewd
investors.
   When municipal-finance news is grim, that often is the
best time to find bargains in tax-free bonds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Remember New York City's financial crisis of the
mid-1970s? Investors who were smart enough back then to buy
long-term bonds issued by the city or Municipal Assistance
Corp. have done exceptionally well.
   Bad news can force state and local governments, as well as
other municipal issuers, to offer higher yields to attract
investors. Some investment-grade tax-free bonds now yield
nearly 8% -- the equivalent of about 11% on a taxable bond
for an investor in the 28% federal income-tax bracket. By
comparison, top-rated state bonds now yield about 7%.
   Moreover, investors who buy the bonds of battered
governments also have the opportunity for capital
appreciation in the years ahead, as the issuer works through
its problems and the market price of its securities rises.
   But spotting such buys isn't easy. Even the professionals
who manage municipal bond mutual funds acknowledge that
bargain-hunting is increasingly tricky, because the finances
of so many state and local governments appear precarious.
   "Credit conditions are deteriorating nationally,
especially in the Northeast," warns Freda Johnson, a
consultant who previously headed the municipal-finance
department at Moody's Investors Service Inc. "I expect more
municipal downgrades this year than upgrades from all the
major rating agencies."
   Though defaults are comparatively rare, they do occur. In
most cases, though, the far bigger danger for investors is
that the market value of their bonds can plummet quickly if
the issuer runs into problems. While investors who can hold
the bonds until maturity shouldn't fret, those who need their
money sooner might have to sell at a loss.
   To minimize the risk to their own financial well-being,
investors eager to capitalize on municipal issuers' woes
shouldn't go overboard. The core of their municipal bond
portfolio should be mainly issues that have high ratings,
investment managers and financial analysts say.
   Municipal bonds should represent "the conservative portion
of an investor's portfolio," says Christine Carter Lynch,
managing editor of Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a
newsletter. "They should have predictable income, and you
should be able to count on them without question."
   This also means people shouldn't put all of their tax-free
portfolio into a single-state municipal bond fund. These are
mutual funds that buy bonds issued only by that state and its
municipalities, which makes their interest income exempt from
all federal, state and local income taxes for investors who
are residents of that state. As a result, they are extremely
popular and are proliferating rapidly.
   But the lack of geographical diversity means that if a
state runs into financial problems, the total return -- this
includes price changes, as well as interest income -- can
suffer. "If you live in a high-income-tax state, you
generally do want to own bonds from your own state, or you
want to own specialty-state bond funds," says Aaron S.
Gurwitz, vice president in fixed-income research at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. Nevertheless, he says, "You might also want to
have some diversification to hedge against deterioration of
your own state's economy."
   Investors also shouldn't assume that all triple-A-rated
bonds will always be able to retain their high ratings,
municipal-finance specialists say. For example, Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. has placed two top-rated issues, New Jersey and
North Carolina, on its CreditWatch list of ratings that are
subject to a possible downgrade.
   Don't be panicked by a downgrade, however. Frequently, the
news has been so widely expected by professional bond traders
that it has little or no effect when it finally occurs. Even
if a rating change does catch traders by surprise and drives
a bond's price down, it is often best for individual
investors to step back and wait for the smoke to clear. An
investor who tries to sell quickly can get caught in a crush
of sellers trying to squeeze through the same small door.
   As for bargain-hunting, the pros say to look for
turnaround situations. These are bonds with prices that have
been hammered hard this year, but the state's financial
situation finally may be improving.
   Some analysts are especially bullish on bonds of
Southwestern states, where they expect strong economic growth
in coming years after many lean years. Earlier this month,
the Commerce Department projected that Southwestern states,
such as Nevada, will lead the nation in economic growth
through the end of the century. Moreover, if oil prices turn
around, as some analysts predict, this could benefit bonds
from the Oil Patch region, such as Texas and Louisiana.
   New York's bonds tumbled earlier this year, hurt by the
state's economic weakness and a lengthy, bitter budget
battle. Lately, though, a few fund managers say prices have
fallen so much that the bonds are looking increasingly
attractive.
   "I see a buying opportunity here," says Peter J.D. Gordon,
a managing director at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. in
Baltimore. "The worst news on New York probably is behind
us."
   New York state's long-term bonds are rated single-A, one
of the lowest ratings in the nation, by both Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's. New York state long-term bonds yield about
7.4%. "I would doubt the New York state situation would
deteriorate significantly further," says Ms. Johnson, the
public-finance consultant.
   Municipal bond specialists also suggest looking beyond
"general obligation bonds," which are backed by the issuers'
full faith and taxing ability. Some "revenue bonds," which
are backed by revenues generated by the entity being
financed, offer excellent value, says Neal Attermann, vice
president and manager of municipal-bond research at Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co.
   For example, he recommends New York State Power Authority
long-term bonds, now yielding more than 7.25%.
   Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president at Gabriele,
Hueglin &amp; Cashman, is bullish on some bonds that he says have
been tarnished with a bad image. For example, he cites bonds
issued by Washington Public Power Supply System on behalf of
nuclear power plant Units 1, 2 and 3. Many investors will
never forget or forgive WPPSS, popularly known as "Whoops,"
for defaulting on a record $2.25 billion of bonds in 1983 for
Units 4 and 5.
   "I like bonds of WPPSS 1, 2 and 3," Mr. Hueglin says,
"because they still are undervalued, due to the bad publicity
WPPSS has received" for its record default.
   Several analysts agree, however, that investors should
steer clear of most lower-rated hospital bonds and industrial
development bonds. Last year, S&amp;P cut its ratings on 36
hospital issues, while raising them on only 12. And in this
year's first quarter, S&amp;P lowered ratings on 14 issues, while
raising only five.
   To help protect against unexpected interest-rate changes,
the pros suggest "laddering," that is, buying bonds with a
wide range of maturities, ranging from very short-term to
long-term. Some investors arrange their holdings so that part
of their bond holdings comes due each year. If rates surge,
short-term bonds look best; if rates plunge, long-term bonds
benefit. Similarly, mutual fund investors can sprinkle their
holdings among bond funds with varying maturities.
   Safety-conscious investors also should consider tax-free
bonds backed by U.S. Treasury issues, known as "escrowed" or
"pre-refunded" bonds, says Mr. Hueglin. He says these bonds
combine the "highest quality and tradability on the market
with little yield sacrifice."

   Product-Liability Bill Provides Opportunity
   For Long-Term Milking of PACs by Congress

   WASHINGTON -- A titanic struggle is under way in Congress
over legislation that would overhaul product-liability law.
Just the kind of fight lobbyists and lawmakers love, it pits
two giant special interests, Big Business and trial lawyers,
against each other.
   But despite million-dollar lobbying campaigns by both
sides, Congress is unlikely to act on the measure this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And that's good news for members of Congress and lobbyists
who, for almost a decade, have been feeding off the
contributions from political action committees and the fat
retainers that product-liability legislation has generated.
It means PAC contributions and lobbying fees will continue
next year.
   The bill is part of a breed of legislation known as a
"cash cow." Rarely do these cash-generating pieces of
legislation ever pass. But like perennial flowers, they
sprout again every Congress, replenishing the coffers of
lawmakers and lobbyists. Other cash cows have resulted from
efforts to narrow the insurance industry's exemption from
federal antitrust law and to curb the civil use of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.
   A business lobbying coalition, made up of chemical, auto
and pharmaceutical manufacturers and insurance companies that
want federal legislation to limit the rights of plaintiffs in
lawsuits over allegedly defective products, has contributed
more than $2 million since 1983 to members of the Senate
Commerce Committee. A product-liability bill has been
introduced in each new Congress in that period, and last
month the panel approved another such bill by a 13-7 vote.
   For Sen. Slade Gorton (R., Wash.), a co-sponsor of the
current product-liability bill, this lobbying effort has
meant more than $200,000 in PAC contributions for his Senate
races in 1986 and 1988. For Sen. John Rockefeller (D.,
W.Va.), a more recent convert, it has meant $60,000 in PAC
contributions for his 1990 re-election drive.
   Trial lawyers, whose contingency fees in product-liability
cases are endangered by the bill, have contributed, too.
Their PAC money has been a much more modest $81,000, but
hundreds of thousands of dollars more in contributions flow
directly from individual lawyers.
   Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), who voted against the bill
last month, has received $20,000 from the PAC of the powerful
Association of Trial Lawyers of America in recent years. Sen.
Ernest Hollings, (D., S.C.), chairman of the panel and a foe
of product-liability overhaul, received $5,000 from the
trial-lawyers association's PAC and thousands more from
individual trial lawyers.
   "The bill is a PAC annuity for members of Congress," says
Ralph Nader, one of several consumer activists allied with
the trial lawyers. "It's like rubbing the golden lamp." A PAC
analysis by Public Citizen, one of Mr. Nader's
consumer-advocacy groups, shows that six members of the
Senate Commerce Committee, all of whom voted for the
product-liability bill, received more than 12% of their PAC
money in their most recent re-election campaigns from
companies or trade associations lobbying for the measure.
   But Mr. Nader's own sources of funding have become an
issue in the product-liability fight. Some proponents of the
bill allege that he and other consumer activists lobbying
against the bill depend on trial lawyers for financial
support.
   "I'm not saying he's in their pocket, but Ralph Nader is
the trial lawyer's hero," says Victor Schwartz, a Washington
lawyer who represents one of the business groups lobbying on
product-liability legislation. His side has spent more than
$1 million each year on a massive lobbying drive.
   Mr. Nader concedes that some of his groups receive
contributions from individual trial lawyers. "But if they
didn't exist, this fight would go on," he says. Joan
Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, says contributions
from trial lawyers amount to a "minuscule" portion of Public
Citizen's $4 million annual budget. Public Citizen doesn't
accept corporate contributions, including any funds from the
trial-lawyers association, she adds.
   Some members of the Senate Commerce Committee have taken
PAC money from both the coalition promoting the
product-liability legislation and the trial lawyers opposing
it. "The bill has been a boon to many legislators running for
Congress because they get money from both sides," says Alan
Parker, deputy executive director of public affairs for the
trial-lawyers association.
   Besides its contributions, the association also has a team
of experienced lobbyists, led by Thomas Boggs Jr. of the
politically well-connected Washington law firm of Patton,
Boggs &amp; Blow.
   The politically touchy issue of money spilled into the
open at a Commerce Committee hearing on the bill in May. A
number of senators, including Mr. Rockefeller, expressed
outrage over a letter Mr. Nader sent to their home-state
newspapers. In the letter, Mr. Nader suggested that members
of the panel were "huddled" with Washington lobbyists, also
major contributors to their campaigns, who favor the
product-liability bill. At the hearing, an angry Sen.
Rockefeller asked the committee staff to investigate the
funding of several consumer groups to see how much money they
receive from trial lawyers.
   Although the West Virginia Democrat quickly called off the
investigation, he remains angry over Mr. Nader's lobbying
tactics. "The one thing the people of West Virginia know is
that I don't owe my soul to anybody," says Mr. Rockefeller,
who is the great-grandson, namesake and heir of the late
founder of Standard Oil, and who spent millions of his
personal fortune to win his first Senate election in 1984. "I
don't say that snottily," he adds, "that's just one of the
advantages of having independent means."
   The Nader forces, meanwhile, intend to make the large PAC
contributions from companies and trade associations
supporting the bill a big issue as the fight moves toward the
Senate floor. "The issue would not exist in Congress were it
not for the PAC contributions," says Pamela Gilbert,
legislative director for Congress Watch, another arm of the
Nader organization.
   St. Clair Tweedie, director of government affairs for
American Cyanamid Co., says such arguments are overblown and
that the PAC money contributed to Commerce Committee members
by companies and groups in the product-liability coalition
isn't necessarily tied to the bill. "We have many issues," he
says. "They {plaintiffs' lawyers} have only one: Don't screw
with my yacht."
   Although the Commerce Committee approved the bill, the
measure is now in the hands of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which is less likely to give its approval, and the
Senate floor outlook is even more uncertain. There hasn't
been any House action this year on a product-liability bill,
and there probably won't be.
   And this keeps the lawmakers in the catbird's seat. The
bitter lobbying stalemate means that product-liability
legislation will remain in legislative limbo -- a cash cow
with plenty of milk left. "This bill has the perfect tension
to keep it alive," says Mr. Schwartz.

   AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas grand jury has returned the first
indictments in an investigation of the state's insurance
industry, triggered by the $93.5 million collapse of two
companies controlled by high-rolling Texan Robert H. Walker.
   Mr. Walker was charged with a combined 14 counts of theft,
misapplication of funds and filing of false statements in his
management of National County Mutual Fire Insurance Co. and
of Walker General Agency, a primary insurance wholesaler.
Both companies were placed in receivership in late 1988 after
National County was declared insolvent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also indicted, on unrelated charges of commercial bribery
and misapplication of funds, were John Gordon, Frances Gordon
and W.H. "Pip" Lasiter, owners of Best Lloyds Insurance Co.,
which was declared insolvent and placed in receivership in
April of 1988. An indictment charging misappropriation of
more than $1 million in premiums also was returned against
R.W. Brayton, an official with the State Board of Insurance
from 1976 through 1979.
   State insurance regulators allegedly ignored warnings
about Mr. Walker's flamboyant lifestyle and use of company
premiums for unrelated expenses for several years before
National County collapsed.
   According to former associates, Mr. Walker used income
from his auto insurance companies to create a maze of
companies in various industries. He then allegedly siphoned
off cash from this empire to pay the $6,000-a-month mortgage
on his house, buy a nine-seat helicopter with gold-plated
door handles and a yacht in Monte Carlo, among other things.
   An outraged state legislature responded to National
County's demise by demanding a statewide investigation of the
industry, and all three members of the State Board of
Insurance were replaced. Steve McCleery, first assistant
district attorney for Travis County, says the grand jury is
reviewing at least 60 additional cases for possible fraud.
   Mr. Walker's whereabouts, meanwhile, are unknown, although
he is believed to be living in Europe. Mr. McCleery said a
fugitive warrant will be issued and added that his office has
sought extradition in the past.

   Dollar Gains as Mark Declines on News
   Of Possible Changes in Soviet Leadership

   NEW YORK -- The dollar ended mostly higher after receiving
a boost from foreign-exchange traders' desertion of the mark
on news of turmoil in the Soviet Union. The West German
currency fell against all other major currencies, allowing
the gains by its U.S. counterpart.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told a stormy Communist
party conference he may soon no longer be the party leader.
"Tomorrow, or after 10 days or 12 days, there may be another
General Secretary," Mr. Gorbachev said. He didn't say whether
he would resign his post or be forced out as chairman by
party hardliners.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Recently, there has been some speculation that Mr.
Gorbachev could relinquish his post as party secretary to
concentrate on his duties as Soviet president.
   According to a second report -- later corrected -- the
Soviet Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan declared
independence. The Tass news agency corrected its story to say
the Uzbekistan parliament was merely debating a draft of such
a declaration.
   But the short-term damage to the mark had already been
done. In the confusion, the dollar rose to its intraday high
of 1.6840 marks, about 22 minutes after the correction had
appeared on news services.
   The mark was hurt by the political news more than other
non-dollar currencies for various reasons, dealers said.
   At the beginning of trading, the foreign exchange market
was generally long marks. When dealers moved to the dollar --
the traditional safe-haven currency in times of turmoil --
the mark had the most to lose.
   Also, as the Soviet Union's biggest trading partner in the
West, West Germany is considered the most vulnerable to
economic deterioration by its giant neighbor. And it is
assumed that divisiveness in the Soviet Union will delay
unity in Germany.
   The planned reunification of East and West Germany has
been the principal support beneath the mark of late, largely
accounting for its 20-pfennig rise against the dollar since
the Berlin Wall fell in November.
   By coincidence, the start-up of German monetary union and
the opening of the 28th Soviet Communist Party Congress,
where Mr. Gorbachev's leadership faces a challenge, will fall
on the same date: July 2.
   Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6785
marks, up from 1.6738 marks late Tuesday in New York. The
U.S. currency also was changing hands at 153.93 yen, up from
153.55. Sterling was trading at $1.7215, up from $1.7210 late
Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 154.33 yen; it closed Wednesday in Tokyo at 153.98 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6793
marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.6790 marks.
   Helping the mark recover from its intraday low against the
dollar on Wednesday was a feeling among traders that, for Mr.
Gorbachev, shedding the burden of being both Soviet president
and Communist leader may be the best thing, said Peter
Iversen of Shawmut Bank of Boston.
   David Puth, foreign exchange manager for Chemical Bank,
added that "people's memories are still very geared to what
happened last time" there was a report that Mr. Gorbachev
would resign. Last Jan. 30, when Cable News Network reported
that Mr. Gorbachev might step down as Communist Party chief,
the dollar soared about 2% from around 1.6800 marks to 1.7130
marks within 15 minutes.
   The story was denied, and the dollar retreated as quickly
as it had advanced. "When the market moves that fast," Mr.
Puth said, "people are losing money." This time, he said,
traders were more wary.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery rose $1.40 to $350.50 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a moderate 3.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $350.45 an
ounce.

   WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
voted to approve Chicago Board of Trade proposals to trade
options on the exchange's Tokyo stock price index-futures
contract and its long-term Japanese government bond-futures
contract.
   The option on the Tokyo stock price index, known as Topix,
will give the holder the right to buy or sell Topix futures
contracts at a specified strike price by a certain expiration
date. Option premiums will be quoted in Japanese yen.

   The CFTC also directed its staff to draft an
interpretation clarifying regulatory treatment of the Brent
oil 15-day contract. The interpretation is expected to
clarify that the Brent oil contract is a forward contract and
thus exempt from CFTC jurisdiction.
   A forward contract is generally an agreement that is
privately negotiated between two commercial parties and isn't
required to be traded on a registered futures exchange.

   Allegheny Ludlum Corp., Pittsburgh, said it has
accelerated its previously announced plans to build and
operate a commercial prototype thin-strip direct-casting
machine to produce stainless and carbon steel flat products.
   The machine will be designed and installed by the
specialty steel producer's joint venture partner,
Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau Ges.m.b.H., of Linz,
Austria. Voest-Alpine is a supplier of casting machines.
Terms were not disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny Ludlum did not say where the plant housing the
machine will be located but said construction will begin in
the second quarter of 1991 and is expected to be completed in
the second half of 1991.
   The company said it expects the new process to advance
state-of-the-art steelmaking significantly because it
eliminates the need for conventional slag or ingot casting or
hot strip rolling that currently is used by metal concerns.
The new process, Allegheny Ludlum said, is expected to be
commercially available in the mid-1990s.

   UAL Unions Woo Boeing, GE in Bid
   To Get Backing for Buy-Out of United

   UAL Corp.'s unions are seeking to persuade Boeing Co. and
General Electric Co. to invest in the labor group's proposed
$4.38 billion buy-out of United Airlines.
   Boeing and GE declined to comment on the talks, which
union officials described as "very preliminary." But a strong
incentive to such an arrangement, which would reduce the
unions' dependence on bank financing, apparently would be to
make Boeing and GE the leading candidates for a pending
aircraft and jet-engine order that is expected to total about
four times the value of the buy-out.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The labor group, which has an Aug. 9 deadline to finance
their offer, is said to be seeking either a cash or debt
investment from Boeing and GE.
   In return, Boeing and GE would receive either preferred
stock or a note in UAL, but no common stock, since the unions
want to keep the company 100% employee-owned. The unions also
discussed giving Boeing and GE preferred-supplier status,
people familiar with the talks said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
UAL fell 25 cents a share to $156, well below the $201 a
share buy-out price.
   It couldn't be determined if Seattle-based Boeing, the
nation's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, or GE,
the Fairfield, Conn., maker of electronic products and jet
engines, would be interested in joining the buy-out effort.
It was also unclear how much of a say in UAL the unions would
give those companies if they agreed to join the buy-out.
   An investment from either Boeing or GE would reduce the
buy-out group's dependence on bank financing at a time when
lenders are reluctant to finance takeovers. Banks have been
particularly cool toward the UAL proposal, citing concerns
about how the employee-owned company would be governed.
   An agreement with Boeing or GE could give the unions
considerable added leverage in dealing with banks. Any
financing that GE or Boeing might provide, would be
subordinate to the banks' contribution, therefore cushioning
commercial lenders in the event of a default, officials close
to the talks said.
   United has longstanding relationships with both companies.
Boeing is currently in a heated battle to land an aircraft
order from United that is expected to total more than $15
billion, possibly the largest ever placed. GE is in the
running to provide the engines for one of the aircraft types
United is considering, the Boeing 777, a version of a jet
United already operates.
   The unions may try to seek as much as $1 billion in
financing from GE and Boeing. General Electric Capital, a GE
subsidiary, provides loans for buy-outs.
   The labor group is said to be seeking between $2.5 billion
and $3 billion from banks. Gerald Greenwald, the former
Chrysler Corp. vice chairman who is heading the employee
buy-out effort, has held talks over the last two weeks with
as many as eight banks. Banks received copies of the unions'
business plan last week. But the buy-out group has yet to
enter into formal negotiations with any lender.
   At these meetings, bank representatives sought assurances
that the unions won't block asset sales to pay down debt.
Although the majority of UAL's board, as envisioned, would
consist of outside directors, the unions' board
representatives could block any asset sales.
   Banks also have indicated they would feel more comfortable
if the buy-out had the backing of an outside equity investor.
The unions are proving "sweat equity" in the form of $2
billion of wage concessions.
   It was unclear whether Boeing or GE's participation in the
buy-out would pose any antitrust questions, particularly if
they were to receive preferred-supplier status.
   There is precedent for Boeing's involvement. Three years
ago, the company entered into an unusual financing agreement
with United that would have permitted it to take a 16% stake
in the airline. Ironically, Boeing had agreed to the move in
an effort to help UAL's management at the time ward off a
takeover proposal from United's pilot union.

   OTTAWA -- The Manitoba and Newfoundland governments
introduced in their respective legislatures bills to ratify
the proposed Meech Lake constitutional accord, but prospects
for passage of the bills appeared doubtful.
   The Meech Lake accord, negotiated three years ago, is a
package of constitutional amendments designed to meet the
constitutional concerns of Quebec and to defuse the
independence forces in the largely French-speaking province.
The accord would recognize Quebec as a "distinct society"
within Canada.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Manitoba and Newfoundland are the only provinces that
haven't yet ratified the accord. If the agreement doesn't get
their approval by Saturday, it will lapse.
   The Manitoba government's efforts to get the ratification
bill before its legislature were delayed for a week by a
filibuster by the legislature's only aboriginal member,
Elijah Harper. Most Canadian aboriginal groups oppose the
amendments because they say they don't address their concerns
over native rights.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said he will address the
Newfoundland legislature today in an effort to win support
for the Meech Lake accord. Many Newfoundland legislators have
expressed opposition to the agreement.

   They Love Old Glory Now -- They Reviled It Back Then

   There are probably a few politicians in Washington who are
seriously and unreservedly in favor of amending the Bill of
Rights each time some transient threat arises. Sen. Jesse
Helms comes immediately to mind. There is undoubtedly a
slightly larger clutch of office-holders who have convinced
themselves that two or three dedicated flag-burners (or two
or three hundred for that matter) pose a threat to the nation
so great, a challenge to the nation's sense of itself so
impudently presumptuous, that qualifications should be
attached to the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech
and expression.
   But the number of congressmen, Democrat and Republican,
who honestly believe flag-burning is a clear and present
danger to the Republic is as small proportionately as the
number of exhibitionists champing to torch Old Glory. The
vast majority backing the amendment are cynical partisans,
cowards, summer soldiers or timeservers without a conviction
more meaningful than the need for self-protection.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Watching the news or reading the papers, it is
occasionally difficult to hold down the food. When a
politician in a leadership role like House GOP whip Newt
Gingrich contemptuously refers to the "five lawyers" on the
Supreme Court who struck down the flag-burning law, it's easy
to believe the clock has been turned back 36 years. Then,
another Supreme Court overturned precedent and ruled
"separate but equal" schools unconstitutional, and another
group of barking political jackals declared war on the court.
The late Sen. James Eastland of Mississippi, the
segregationist champion, was no less cynical than Rep.
Gingrich is today telling cheering crowds they had a "sacred
duty" to defy the court. And all those Southern politicians
who declared eternal resistance to the decision invoked
majority opinion as their sacred god no less than those who
now push for a constitutional amendment to save the nation
from itself.
   There is something else worth noting in comparing the
blatant hypocrisy of the never-never segregationists of the
1950s and 1960s and the flag-savers today. High in the ranks
of today's Capitol Hill patriots are men who were ardent
defenders of sedition and silent supporters of insurrection
only yesterday. Among them are men who implicitly stood on
the side of the mobs when federal force was required to give
life to the principle of equal justice before the law
regardless of race. To watch them speaking grandiloquently of
the need to protect the symbol of the nation is to realize
there are people without shame.
   For some time it has been hard to remain silent when
encountering some of those sporting American flag lapel pins.
I remember when their public commitment to that symbol of
American unity might have been meaningful, but was
conspicuously absent. In the early and mid-1960s, those who
flew the American flag or otherwise displayed it in many
parts of the Deep South were perceived as enemies of "our way
of life." During that terrible last convulsion of the old
racist order, when the Eastlands, Wallaces and Barnetts were
calling the Southern shots -- and a number of today's
all-American political heroes were their aides -- everything
the American flag represented was fair game.
   That was a time of real crisis, when basic American values
were at stake and everyone had to decide what mattered and
what did not. To put it bluntly, some now leading the charge
for protecting the flag were among those desecrating it by
their actions and attitudes then. There is no need to list
names, though each knows his own and I would provide them for
those who ask. The point is, the bedrock meaning of the
nation and its future direction were being determined in
those days, and the side those politicians chose was
contemptible in goal and vicious in method" -- un-American"
in word and deed, to use one of their favorite phrases.
   Such men are but a tiny minority of those who now clamor
to head the list of those who would torch the Bill of Rights
to save its symbol. The vast majority supporting a
constitutional amendment to prohibit flag-desecration are
opportunists above all else. They've read the polls and know
their duty -- join the lemmings' rush. At root, that is also
"un-American." Ours is not a plebiscitory democracy where
issues are instantaneously decided by moving majorities, but
a representative government in which those we elect are
supposed to represent principle and thought as well as
today's popular opinion.
   Put the president at the head of those who should know
better, and he probably does. He knows the televised images
of flag-burning are gross distortions. He knows those who
burn the flag are at least as cynically manipulative as those
who would profit politically from their symbolic games.
George Bush knows that in the real world of tough issues,
flag-burning is not in the top 100, let alone the top 10.
Unfortunately, he also knows a free ride when he sees one,
and he is incapable of passing one up no matter how
demeaning.
   It is good to see the Democratic leadership in both houses
come out forthrightly against the amendment. It is depressing
to realize this is not an issue on which heavy chits are
being called, as witness the decisions of such orthodox
Democrats as Sen. Max Baucus of Montana and Rep. Tom McMillan
to support the amendment. There is too much sympathy among
many Democrats about the understandable need for this
congressman or that senator to take a walk on the issue, lest
he be bludgeoned into political oblivion. Utterly amoral
political consultants are quoted regularly about the issue's
potency, or at least its potential impact, and those
quotations become justification enough for cowardice.
   It's the wrong time for the politics of expediency. Just
as the Constitution itself has been preserved because of its
resilience, the Bill of Rights has been preserved because of
its enduring integrity. When you are dealing with something
this fundamental, you cannot take risks. Chop away a little
in the name of the flag today; chop away a little more
tomorrow in the name of public morals; undercut it further on
the day after in the name of crime in the streets. It is at
exactly the moment that a majority is most intent on tearing
away the protections that have preserved liberty that those
who know better must stand up and say "no]"
   There is no free pass on this one. Preserving the Bill of
Rights is not a minor matter. Politicians who stress the need
to save themselves to fight the good fight in the future are
kidding themselves and the public. There will be no better
fight, not because the proposed amendment is particularly
meaningful in itself, but because the precedent would be so
horrific.
   A little more than 30 years ago, all but a handful of
Southern congressmen signed "The Southern Manifesto,"
repudiating the Supreme Court's desegregation decision and
endorsing resistance to it. Among them were men sickened by
what they were doing but convinced they had to stay in office
for the sake of a larger good. But not one ever again found
himself capable of breaking with the monolithic
segregationist front when it mattered. So it is likely to be
for those who know better but reluctantly go along with the
flag-burning amendment. Saying yes to this one, they will
find it even harder to say no to the next ones sure to come
if it is ratified.

   NEW YORK -- The woman whose life was the basis for the
book and movie "The Three Faces of Eve," reached a settlement
with Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. over the movie rights
to her life story.
   Under terms of the agreement, Fox acknowleged Christine
Costner Sizemore's right to grant motion picture rights to
her current book, "A Mind of My Own," her previous books and
any future books she may write.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. Sizemore acknowledged that Fox holds and retains all
rights to "The Three Faces of Eve." The 1957 movie was a
major hit and won an Oscar for actress Joanne Woodward, who
played "Eve" in the story.
   Mrs. Sizemore, who had been treated for
multiple-personality disorder, signed the rights away to Fox
for $7,000 in 1956. She previously said she wasn't
represented by a lawyer and "the personalities would've
signed anything" her psychiatrist recommended. Mrs. Sizemore
said she was cured in 1974 and has since become an advocate
for the rights of the mentally ill.
   Mrs. Sizemore, who lives in Florida, had sued in federal
court in Manhattan last year, challenging Fox's claim that it
held all the motion picture rights to her life story.
   Mrs. Sizemore said in a statement she was pleased that the
differences were resolved with Fox. Officials of Fox, which
is owned by News Corp., couldn't be reached for comment.

   Family Circumstances
   Tied to Dropping Out

   ONE IN FIVE eighth graders is at serious risk of failing
in school or dropping out before graduating from high school,
the Department of Education reports.
   Researchers for the department used six common indicators
of "at-risk" status: coming from a single-parent family,
coming from a household with income below $15,000, being home
alone more than three hours a day, having a dropout as a
sibling, having limited English skills and having parents who
didn't finish high school.
   A 1988 survey of nearly 25,000 eighth-graders in 1,000
public and private schools nationwide found that 53% had no
risk factors and 26% had one. But just over 20% had two or
more. These students already showed low grades and high
absenteeism. The study will follow the sample as they move
through high school and beyond, trying to identify factors
fostering or hindering success in school.
   Along similar lines, a Louis Harris &amp; Associates survey
last year for Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., covering 2,000
public school teachers in all grades, found them increasingly
concerned over student behavioral problems.
   Over half consider absenteeism a serious problem, and
three in four worry about the number of latchkey children,
those left on their own after school. Compared with a similar
survey only four years earlier, much higher percentages of
junior high and high school teachers list student drinking,
drug use, teen-age pregnancy, dropouts and suicide as serious
problems.
                                                                                                       

   Growth Will Make '90s
   A Billion-Person Decade
                                                                                                       

   FERTILITY RATES are inching up in a few low-fertility
countries, including the U.S., but continue to decline in
many high-fertility countries.
   Still, says the Population Reference Bureau, a private
research group in Washington, the 1990s will see the largest
increase in the world's population of any decade yet, adding
another billion people to the present 5.3 billion. It took 11
years to add the last billion. By mid-1998, the bureau
believes, the global population will surpass six billion.
   The bureau's Carl Haub says the fertility rate has
rebounded from extremely low levels in several developed
countries. Government and private demographers now estimate
that the total fertility rate in the U.S. last year was 2.0
-- the highest since 1972, though still below the 2.1
replacement rate. The total fertility rate is the number of
likely lifetime births per woman.
   The U.S. rate fell from a postwar high of 3.77 in 1957 to
a low of 1.7 in 1976, then hovered around 1.8 for a decade.
But the 1988 rate crept up to 1.9, and the 1989 rate
apparently edged up further.
   Sweden, West Germany, Iceland and Finland also have seen
turnarounds. In Sweden, the rate fell to 1.6 in the early
1980s, but has climbed back to 2.0. West Germany, which fell
below 1.3 in 1985, has turned up to 1.4.
   Demographers note that starting in the 1970s, more young
women delayed childbearing into their 30s, reducing the
fertility rate. Now, these women are finally having their
children, helping to nudge the rate back up. Many specialists
say it's too early to tell whether there is also a movement
back to slightly larger families.
   Bangladesh, Egypt and China are among countries
experiencing substantial declines in fertility rates. Mr.
Haub figures Rwanda now has the world's highest rate, an
estimated 8.3, while Italy's 1.3 is the lowest.
                                                                                                       

   Voting-Age Populace
   Is Becoming Grayer
                                                                                                       

   BABY BOOMERS and old folks bulk ever larger in the
voting-age population.
   The Census Bureau says the number of men and women 18
years old and over will exceed 186 million by this fall's
congressional elections, nearly eight million higher than in
the 1986 off-year vote. Almost 82 million -- about 44% of
this fall's total -- will be in the 25-to-44 age range, born
during the baby boom years. This age group accounted for only
38.5% of the total in 1980.
   Of course, a large share of the voting-age population
doesn't get around to voting. In the 1986 congressional
elections, only one-third actually voted.
   The 65-plus age group will be 6.2 million larger this fall
than in 1980, accounting for about 17% of the voting-age
population. The relative size of the 18-to-24 group has
shrunk by one-quarter in the past decade, to 14% of this
fall's total, while the 45-to-64 bracket has increased
slightly in numbers but shrunk as a percentage of the whole.
   Women of voting age continue to outnumber men. They will
make up 52% of the voting-age population and three out of
five of those 65 and over.
   Over 21 million blacks will be of voting age this fall, or
11.3% of the total. In 1980, their percentage was 10.6%.
About 11 million live in the South, accounting for 17% of the
area's voting-age population.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends

   PROBLEMS with fertility put serious emotional burdens on
both marriage partners, but the stress on the wife is
considerably greater than that on the husband, psychologist
Frank Andrews and colleagues at the University of Michigan
report. . . . Nearly two out of three Americans believe
Medicare benefits will shrink by the time they retire,
according to a Gallup Organization poll for the Employee
Benefit Research Institute. The younger the respondent, the
greater the concern. . . . Jobs that require pregnant women
to stand for long hours substantially increase the risk of
premature delivery, says a group of Yale Medical School
epidemiologists.

   The Bretton Woods standards did not subordinate domestic
growth to international stability, as critics of U.S. dollar
policy began to argue in the 1960s; nor did they manipulate
international mechanisms such as exchange rates to
accommodate domestic expansion or inflation, as was done in
the 1970s. They recognized that domestic and international
stability and growth were directly interrelated. If domestic
prices began to diverge in the major countries, international
prices or exchange rates would also have to diverge. If
domestic economies became increasingly inflexible, countries
increasingly would have to make their balance of payments
adjustments through borrowing or through trade, exchange
rate, and capital market restrictions. There was no way to
have your cake and eat it, too. Domestic and international
policies depended upon one another: Domestic policies
couldn't succeed without international competition, and
international cooperation could not compensate for
undisciplined domestic policies.

decks from Sony Corp. The contract, valued at $25 million in
the first year, replaces an existing agreement that was
effective through next May.
   Exabyte makes cartridge tape storage systems for mainframe

   GERMANY'S FUTURE CAPITAL

   As German unity nears, the argument over a future capital
continues to grow.
   Berlin, capital of the old Germany, is working hard to
prepare to resume its role as the power center of the new
nation. But Bonn, West Germany's "temporary" capital since
1949, has launched a campaign to hold on to parliament,
ministries and foreign embassies.
   What's likely to emerge is a compromise, with the head of
state, whose role is strictly ceremonial, moving to Berlin
and the city being made the official capital, while the real
seats of power -- the chancellor's office, the parliament and
government ministries -- stay in Bonn.
   A full move to Berlin by all of Bonn's politicians,
bureaucrats, lobbyists, diplomats and journalists could cost,
pro-Bonn campaigners say, at least 80 billion marks ($48
billion).
                                                                                                       

   APPEAL FROM AFRICA
                                                                                                       

   At a summit of African leaders with French President
Francois Mitterrand, the Africans appealed for Western help
to salvage their shattered economies before they can embrace
multiparty democracy. "Africa is suffering more from its
economy than from its politics," Togo's President Gnassingbe
Eyadema told Mr. Mitterrand. Evidently in agreement with that
view, Mr. Mitterrand told the French daily Le Monde that "it
is for the Africans to decide who rules them and how."
                                                                                                       

   LATIN AMERICAN HEALTH CRISIS
                                                                                                       

   Some 170 million people in Latin America are denied basic
nutrition and health care, and more than 40 million live in
critical poverty, a World Health Organization official told
an international conference on "Democracy and Health" in
Caracas. The official, Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, said health
conditions in the region had worsened in the 1980s. Although
the region spent $45 billion on medical care, an estimated
30% of the money was wasted or wrongly spent, he said.
                                                                                                       

   CORRUPTION IN HONG KONG
                                                                                                       

   In a Hong Kong magistrate's court yesterday, Charles
Warwick Reid, former head of the commercial-crime unit of the
Hong Kong Legal Department, pleaded guilty to corruption. Mr.
Reid was charged under the British colony's Prevention of
Bribery Ordinance with possession of assets disproportionate
to his government pay. The assets cited include 2.4 million
New Zealand dollars (US$1.4 million) in bank balances and
three tracts of property in his native New Zealand. The
offense to which Mr. Reid pleaded guilty carries a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of 100,000 Hong Kong
dollars (US$12,840).
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH LANGUAGE CHANGES
                                                                                                       

   France's Premier Michel Rocard accepted a report by the
High Council of the French Language incorporating 15 pages of
recommended spelling changes. The premier said he will ask
National Education Minister Lionel Jospin to assure the
changes are taught in all schools as of next year. The
recommendations indicate the hyphen, much used in French, is
all but being discarded. Thus, "cow-boy" and "week-end" --
two words borrowed from English -- will under the new rules
become "cowboy" and "weekend."
                                                                                                       

   TOBACCO RESTRICTIONS IN CHINA
                                                                                                       

   China's legislature began deliberating a proposed law that
would ensure state revenue from tobacco sales and address the
risks of smoking. The draft bill would restrict cigarette
imports, ban the sale of cigarettes to teenagers and require
China's tobacco industry, the largest in the world, to warn
that "smoking is harmful to human health." Under the proposed
law, the state would control all tobacco imports and exports.
China has an estimated 300 million smokers among its 1.1
billion population.
                                                                                                       

   SWISS REFUGEE LAW
                                                                                                       

   The Swiss parliament gave its final approval to more
restrictive immigration legislation.
   The new law, effective tomorrow, speeds up screening
procedures to separate genuine refugees fleeing political
persecution from people seeking better living conditions. In
a bid to make Switzerland less attractive to economic
migrants, the law also prohibits asylum seekers from working
for the first three months of their stay.
   Last year, nearly 25,000 people asked Switzerland for
refugee status, while a further 40,000 requests remained
outstanding from previous years. More than 95% of
applications processed in 1989 were rejected. Turks
constituted the largest group of asylum seekers, followed by
Sri Lankans.
   Authorities have anticipated there will be at least 32,000
applications for refugee status this year. In a country where
16% of the 6.7 million inhabitants are foreigners, the influx
of immigrants has become a contentious political issue.

   In Passau, West Germany, those who aren't soccer fans can

   From whatever Valhalla dead statesmen look down at the
contemporary world, one of them, at least, must be
contemplating recent developments with particular
satisfaction. That would be Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   Over the 45 years since his death, critics have held FDR
personally responsible for the growth of Soviet power, the
spread of communism and the rise of the Cold War. Roosevelt's
fatal wartime error, critics said, was to subordinate
political to military objectives, neglecting the shape of the
world to come in the interest of beating Hitler. Roosevelt's
naivete, critics claimed, handed Eastern Europe over to the
Soviet Union and encouraged Stalin to undertake his quest for
world domination.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, FDR was many things. He was not, however, renowned
for naivete. He was in fact the most political of
politicians, political in every reflex and to his fingertips
-- and just as political in war as he had been in peace. As a
virtuoso politician, he understood perfectly that there could
be no better cloak for the pursuit of political objectives in
wartime than the claim of total absorption in winning the
war. He had plenty of political objectives all the same. The
perspective of half a century allows us to see them with
greater clarity.
   Was Yalta, after all, the root of all postwar evil? Such
charges come mostly from people who seem never to have read
the agreements made at Yalta.
   Recall the Declaration on Liberated Europe. In this
document Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin pledged that "the
liberated peoples" of Eastern Europe would be enabled "to
choose the form of government under which they will live,"
"to create democratic institutions of their own choice" and
to establish "through free elections . . . governments
responsive to the will of the people." The Declaration on
Poland pledged "a strong, free, independent and democratic
Poland" with "free and unfettered elections . . . on the
basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot."
   Far from handing over Eastern Europe to the Russians, the
Yalta accords called for precisely the democratic Eastern
Europe that is finally coming into existence today. To
achieve his expansionist goals Stalin had to violate his
Yalta pledges. With the Red Army in control in Eastern
Europe, there was little enough the West could do about it.
   The two declarations could not be enforced by diplomatic
methods alone, and in 1945 the U.S. and Britain, with weary
armies in Europe and a war still to be won in the Pacific,
could not conceivably have gone to war against the Soviet
Union over Eastern Europe. Still Roosevelt's declarations
laid down a set of standards for Eastern Europe by which the
world subsequently measured Soviet behavior and found it
wanting.
   Molotov sensed the danger at the time and objected that
the declarations "amounted to interference in the affairs of
liberated Europe." But Stalin signed the declarations
nevertheless, partly because a unanimity rule nullified them
as a check to his immediate plans, partly because he probably
supposed that free elections would result in communist
victories, partly because he did not want to risk an open
break with Roosevelt.
   In the short run, Stalin gained. But statesmanship is
tested by the long run. Now, 45 years later, the Soviet Union
is at last honoring the Yalta agreements. The Eastern Europe
of Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa represents not the
repudiation, but the fulfillment, of Roosevelt's purposes at
Yalta.
   Roosevelt was much criticized too for naivete in
supposedly thinking that he could charm Stalin into amiable
postwar collaboration. Perhaps FDR was not so naive after
all. Stalin was not the helpless prisoner of Marxist-Leninist
ideology. The Soviet dictator, not a man given to undue
modesty, saw himself less as the disciple of Marx and Lenin
than as their fellow prophet.
   Roosevelt therefore had a point in concentrating on Stalin
as the only lever capable of changing the Soviet course. Only
Stalin had the power to rewrite the Soviet approach to world
affairs, as he had already rewritten Soviet domestic ideology
and Soviet history. It was the best chance the West had to
alter the Soviet doctrine of irrevocable hostility between
capitalism and communism.
   FDR's determination to work on and through Stalin was, it
seems in retrospect, founded on shrewd insight. As Walter
Lippmann once observed, Roosevelt was too cynical to think he
could charm Stalin. "He distrusted everybody. What he thought
he could do was outwit Stalin, which is quite a different
thing."
   In the longer run, Roosevelt anticipated a narrowing of
differences, a measure of convergence, between democratic and
communist societies. He told Sumner Welles, his
undersecretary of state, that, marking American democracy as
100 and Soviet communism as zero, the American system, as it
moved away from laissez-faire, might eventually reach 60 and
the Soviet system, as it moved toward democracy, might
eventually reach 40. The illustration was typically slapdash,
but the anticipation looks a good deal less naive in 1990
than it did, say, in 1950.
   Roosevelt, here and elsewhere, had a powerful instinct for
the deep-flowing currents of history. He had no doubt, for
example, that Western colonialism was finished in Asia and
Africa. What seems obvious in the aftermath was not so
obvious at the time. The biggest quarrel between Roosevelt
and Churchill was over the future of India. But, despite
Churchill, the British Empire went the way Roosevelt
expected, and rather quickly too.
   FDR hoped, but failed, to prevent the French from
returning to Indochina. Had he succeeded, America would have
been spared much agony, and many brave Americans who died in
Vietnam would be alive today.
   FDR believed too that China would in due course become a
great power, which is why he wanted to install China as one
of the Four Policemen charged with supervising the peace. For
this thought Roosevelt suffered much ridicule from Churchill
at the time and from critics since. But was Roosevelt's
instinct about China really so naive?
   When Churchill at Tehran objected to the buildup of China,
FDR responded that he wanted China as one of the Big Four,
"not," as the minutes put it, "because he did not realize the
weakness of China at present, but he was thinking farther
into the future. . . . After all China was a nation of 400
million people, and it was better to have them as friends
rather than as a potential source of trouble." At Yalta he
told Churchill that it would take "three generations of
education and training . . . before China could become a
serious factor."
   Two of those three generations have now passed, and China
has grown from 400 million to a billion people. No one can
doubt that China is "a serious factor" today. FDR's
assessment perhaps seems a little less naive than Churchill's
derisive dismissal of those he called the "pigtails" and his
ironical description of China as the "Great American
Illusion."
   Roosevelt had an assured vision of the world he wanted
after the war. It was the vision stated in the speech he gave
50 years ago next January setting forth the Four Freedoms --
freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom
from want, freedom from fear; the vision soon elaborated in
the Atlantic Charter -- a world of democratic nations, based
on human rights, economic growth, social reform, united in a
"permanent system of general security" and in a freely
trading international economy; in short, more or less the
kind of world we are moving toward today.
   There was still great concern in the war years about a
postwar relapse into isolationism. So Roosevelt moved quietly
and methodically during the war to prepare the American
people for a paramount international role.
   By the end of 1944, with the war still on, a series of
international conferences, held mostly at American initiative
and dominated mostly by American agendas, had begun to shape
the postwar world: Bretton Woods (creating the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund and providing for the
stabilization of international exchanges); Dumbarton Oaks
(drawing up plans for the United Nations); Hot Springs (food
and agriculture); Washington (relief and rehabilitation);
Chicago (civil aviation). At his death in April 1945
Roosevelt left an encompassing framework for the world after
the war -- quite an achievement for a leader who allegedly
subordinated political to military goals.
   Of all the statesmen of the first half of the century,
Roosevelt would be the least surprised by the shape of the
world in 1990. For all his insouciance, improvisation and
persiflage, he saw more deeply than his contemporaries into
the great emergent movements of modern history. Let us give
him a little credit.

   Retailing:
   `Segment' Is New Buzzword for PC Sellers

   John Howman thinks he knows where the next big wave of
personal-computer buyers will come from.
   "The home market," says the Milwaukee computer-store
owner. "There's going to be an absolute explosion of home and
home-office buyers."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But even if he's right, Mr. Howman, president of Allied
Computer Group Inc., a franchisee of ValCom Inc., won't make
much money on his prediction. Like an increasing number of PC
dealers, he's concentrating on a few market segments, and the
home market isn't one of them.
   This notion of "segmentation" -- focusing on a limited set
of customers -- is relatively new in the struggling PC retail
business, which has long tried to be all things to all
people. But the concept is gaining ground amid a deepening
profit crisis and prodding from major PC makers, especially
industry leader International Business Machines Corp.
   If it's widely adopted, segmentation would augur a major
change in the way PCs are bought and sold. It promises a
world of niche computer outlets, paralleling the rise of
specialty stores in other retail fields. IBM believes such
outlets will promote increased use of computers in specific
businesses, creating new customers and allowing dealers to
reap big profits on specially tailored packages of hardware
and software.
   Right now, PC retailers face a simple problem. Although
the unfettered expansion of the early and mid-1980s is over,
the number of dealerships continues to grow apace, chasing a
slow-growing customer base. In the past 18 months, that
disparity has led to an all-out price war, squeezing margins
almost to oblivion. As giants such as Businessland Inc. and
the Computer Factory Inc. continue to post poor results, even
optimists are getting worried.
   "Things are pretty bad," says Ed Anderson, chief operating
officer of ComputerLand Corp., a leading computer store
franchiser based in Pleasanton, Calif. "More than a few
people will be selling pens for a living before this is
over."
   A wide range of solutions have been proposed, including
catalog shopping, single-brand stores and warehouse-like
"superstores." But segmentation has garnered the most
interest, if not yet the largest following, in part because
IBM is pushing it so aggressively.
   IBM, like other computer makers, has a big stake in the
ultimate health of the "channel," as the PC retail market is
known. Unless dealers stop squabbling over current customers
and concentrate on creating new ones, IBM's PC growth will
inevitably stall.
   "The real issue dealers must face isn't profitability, but
how to differentiate themselves with the customer," says
David Thomas, head of IBM's National Distribution Division.
"There are people in this business who do well, and they do
well because they have a focus. That's the way to grow a
market."
   IBM has identified more than 40 growing market segments,
such as accounting, auto repair shops and beauty salons. The
computer giant believes dealers can pick a few of these
narrow segments and cater to them with specialized packages
of hardware, software and service.
   Sears Business Centers in Chicago has taken this tack.
Some salespeople focus on systems tailored for attorneys and
others are assigned exclusively to the distribution industry.
Says Richard Foster, Sears regional general manager: "If I'm
going to sell an expensive system to a customer, I'd better
understand his business. How can I do that if I'm selling to
20 different businesses?"
   In Indianapolis, ComputerLand franchisee John Nelson has
started marketing PC systems to small newspapers. Mr. Nelson
says he's still making most of his sales to large customers,
but has discovered that, as IBM promises, niche marketing can
be profitable. "But the software has to be there," he adds.
   IBM's Mr. Thomas agrees -- and promises more software in
the future. He says his aim is to ensure that all
IBM-authorized outlets are in a position to woo a
well-defined set of customers.
   IBM is offering plenty of incentives to achieve this,
including funds for targeted advertising and discounts on
packages of equipment and software. In all, one analyst
estimates, the incentives may add up to seven extra points of
margin on IBM products. Mr. Thomas won't disclose numbers but
concedes that IBM is spending "a significant amount of
money."
   Mr. Thomas insists that "this isn't a forced march," but
IBM also is wielding a big stick. It recently started setting
up barriers to discourage everyone but specialized dealers
from selling certain niche products. It's also restricting
distribution of its hot new RISC System/6000 workstation to
ensure that it's marketed for industry-specific applications.
And Mr. Thomas threatens to help the competitors of any
outlet that refuses to specialize in a market segment that
IBM believes has obvious growth potential.
   Other manufacturers are following suit. "We are all
singing the same tune," says Erna Arnesen, Apple Computer
Inc.'s director of value-added channel development. "The
concept of specialization is a critical element of our
long-term strategy." Like IBM, Apple is subsidizing targeted
ads, and it's identifying local consultants who will work
with its dealers to capture certain market segments. Although
Ms. Arnesen says Apple's strategy is based on incentives,
another leading PC maker, Compaq Computer Corp., has set
stringent requirements for dealers who want to sell its
popular SystemPro.
   After years of mixed signals from manufacturers, dealers
generally welcome a consistent direction. "We've been asking
for IBM's help on segmentation for years," says Cal Albee,
Businessland's IBM product-line director. "IBM isn't forcing
this on the channel," concurs William Keiper, president of
MicroAge Computer Centers Inc., a unit of MicroAge Inc. "It's
just one of those ideas whose time has come."
   But definitions of segmentation vary, and change has been
slow to come. Much of the talk thus far has been lip service:
Most dealers believe they already are focused, and are loath
to sacrifice any part of their revenue stream.
   At Computer Factory, for example, Vice President Russ
Madris says he supports segmentation and criticizes PC makers
for being slow to offer incentives and well-focused packages
of hardware and software. But then he goes on to identify
Computer Factory's two main segments: small-to-medium-sized
businesses and large corporate accounts, which together cover
most of the PC business.
   "I don't think any one dealer, or especially one chain,
would be smart to pick one skinny segment," he explains. "Our
strategy is a matter of leveraging our strengths to two
different marketplaces."
   Seymour Merrin, a PC retail analyst, thinks such attitudes
will prove fatal for many dealers -- and for the strategy of
segmentation. He also believes that "selling to those
segments is an art form that's expensive and unprofitable. If
there was money to be made there, dealers would already be
making it." Instead, he predicts, the future will support
only two types of dealer: the price-oriented superstore and
the service-oriented "superboutique," or systems integrator.
Everyone else, he says, will end up going bankrupt.
   ComputerLand's Mr. Anderson, who admits that about
one-third of his firm's franchisees show signs of resisting
change, also prophesies major trouble ahead for PC dealers.
But unlike Mr. Merrin, he believes segmentation really is the
answer.
   "What we have here is a bunch of people who think they're
Bo Jackson, and can play two sports simultaneously," he says.
"Well, they just won't make it in either major league. To
survive, people must pick a sport."

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Even by Rhode Island standards, the
political career of Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. has been
entertaining.
   He was elected mayor of this blue-collar city as a
Republican and at the tender age of 33. Facing a 1982 primary
challenge in the GOP, he ran for his third term as an
independent and was re-elected. In his nine years as mayor,
he saw a goodly number of officials and other city workers
hustled off to prison, having been convicted on criminal
charges of corruption.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And on the night of March 20, 1983, Mayor Cianci beat up
the lover of his estranged wife, pummeling the fellow and
poking him in the face with a lighted cigarette, as several
cronies -- including the policeman who was the mayor's
chauffeur -- looked on.
   Mr. Cianci pleaded no contest to two assault charges and
resigned his office in disgrace. His sentence was suspended,
and he was put on probation.
   But in a comeback that would be the envy of Richard Nixon,
Buddy Cianci (pronounced see-ANN-see) is currently the toast
of Providence, the host of the highest-rated afternoon
rush-hour radio talk show, a political commentator on TV, a
sought-after after-dinner speaker -- and possibly the next
mayor of Providence.
   As the June 27 filing deadline approaches, the question in
Providence is: Will Buddy run?
   Visiting the opening of a Jaguar dealership on a hot
summer night, he is surrounded by admirers. (As Andy Warhol
once said, and Mr. Cianci does too, he'll go to the opening
of an envelope.) "Are you coming back?" asks a cop on
horseback in the mounted patrol Mr. Cianci created when he
was mayor.
   The effervescent Mr. Cianci, who now is 49, pudgy and
wearing a toupee, seems to know everyone. Men grab his
shoulder, women kiss his cheek and whisper in his ear. "When
are you going to announce? . . . You can do it, you can do
it. . . . I love your show. You gave them hell today. . . .
I'm going to be disappointed if you don't run. . . . What are
you gonna do?"
   He smiles. He shrugs. He doesn't answer. Buddy Cianci's
lips are sealed -- perhaps for the first time ever.
   Even President Bush recently asked reporters about Mr.
Cianci's political future.
   If he runs, local pols say, he can win. Polls show Mr.
Cianci ahead -- whether he runs as an independent, a
Republican or, why not, a Democrat. "Between the Democratic
and Republican parties in Rhode Island, there isn't a hell of
a lot of difference. . . . The only philosophy they have is
to win," notes Mr. Cianci, who is called "Spanky" by some
city workers. His chances are good despite the fact 44% of
Providence voters think his election would be an
embarrassment to the city and even though about a fourth of
them believe he was a corrupt mayor. He denies that.
   His chances are good because the incumbent isn't running
for re-election, because the election is likely to be a
three-way affair that Mr. Cianci could win with a minority of
the vote, and because his admirers, particularly ethnics and
blue-collar workers, are crazy about him. Maybe 25% of the
electorate is smitten. Nobody else has "the star quality
Buddy Cianci does," says Michael Vallante, a Republican
political consultant.
   When Mr. Cianci's "personal domestic matter," as he calls
it, comes up, some Providence voters are more than forgiving
-- they positively empathize. "I think I would have done the
same thing if somebody went after my wife," says Anthony
Drury Jr., a sidewalk vendor. A store clerk on Federal Hill,
the city's Italian neighborhood, goes further: "Maybe if it
was me in his shoes, I would have killed the bastard."
   Rhode Island is tolerant of its public servants. In 1985,
the town council in suburban Johnston voted to allow a member
who had been convicted of odometer tampering to take part in
meetings via telephone from federal prison. (Penitentiary
officials scotched the idea.) Everyone snickered, but the
general reaction, says Mr. Vallante, the consultant, was,
"Hey, that's Rhode Island, it's no big deal."
   Rhode Islanders are similarly amused by the tale of the
convicted murderer turned state's witness who had a heart
attack and died in 1988 (with cocaine in his possession)
while on his way to go sky diving. He was, all the while,
supposedly under the watchful eye of the Providence police.
   Rhode Islanders are so laid back about these things -- and
Mr. Cianci so popular with his claque -- that less than a
year after his ignominious departure from public office in
1984, he was on the air with "The Buddy Cianci Show." An
instant hit, too. Aired from 3 to 6 on weekday afternoons on
WHJJ-AM in East Providence, the soapbox is a politician's
dream. And it is the quintessence of Buddy Cianci:
boisterous, opinionated, egotistical. He ventures opinions on
public issues (from coal-fired power plants to school prayer
and off-track betting). He puts down guests. When a phone
caller challenged him on a recent show, Mr. Cianci
interrupted: "Wait a minute. I'll decide what's important on
my show because I've got the microphone."
   Part of the listening pleasure involves trying to figure
out why he's skewering whom he's skewering. Close listeners
say his favorite targets are people who have crossed him.
Says a politician's aide: It's the opposite of you scratch my
back, I'll scratch yours.
   And he does get to Rhode Islanders. According to Arbitron
ratings, he has 100,000 listeners a week, in a state of just
980,000 residents.
   "How can they give air time to a violent felon to use to
gain retribution {against} his enemies?" wonders Dan Hackett,
editor of Rhode Island Lawyers Weekly and former aide to the
state attorney general who prosecuted Mr. Cianci on the
assault charges.
   Mr. Cianci, a lawyer too, disputes that: "I have certain
opinions I don't hold back on. But settle scores? No."
   One of Mr. Cianci's targets has been Bruce Sundlun, the
Democratic candidate for governor in 1988, who appeared on
his show a few days before the election. Mr. Sundlun made the
mistake of boasting that as president of the local chamber of
commerce he had had something to do with redeveloping
downtown Providence. That made Mr. Cianci mad. So he
lambasted Mr. Sundlun on the air. "He claimed credit for
everything that happened in the city of Providence since
1636," the year the city was founded, complains Mr. Cianci.
   Mr. Sundlun lost the election by just 6,614 votes, or
1.6%. "He sandbagged me," complains Mr. Sundlun, who is
running again this year.
   (When the two men run into each other at the Jaguar
dealership, Mr. Cianci said, "Bruce, I think you're going to
win this time." Replies Mr. Sundlun: "Only if you get
laryngitis.")
   Lately, Mr. Cianci has been attacking Republican
congressional candidate Trudy Coxe. He doesn't approve of her
crossover voting in Democratic primaries, and he is angry
that she refused until recently to appear on his show. "Those
are my beefs, it's not personal," he says. (Her real sin,
some political insiders say, is that she headed an
environmental group that accused the city of polluting
Narragansett Bay while you-know-who was mayor.)
   Mr. Cianci, the son of a proctologist, will have to give
up show business, his broadcasting at any rate, if he runs
for mayor. The decision won't be easy, he says. Life as a
media celebrity is fun -- and lucrative. The radio station is
trying to hold onto him by offering him more money -- some
say half a million dollars over three years. "I get paid now
to do what I did for free," he says.
   He does love the limelight, and his association with
famous and powerful people. The study of his
multimillion-dollar carriage house at the corner of Power and
Benefit streets, near downtown, displays pictures of Buddy
with George Burns, Buddy with Frank Sinatra, Buddy with
President Ford, Buddy with Vice President Bush, Buddy with
Muhammad Ali.
   He confesses: "I miss the hustle and bustle."
   He says the run-in with his former friend, the lover of
his ex-wife, should not be an issue: "I left {office} under
circumstances I'm not proud of. But I paid my price. To err
is human, to forgive divine."
   If he runs, Mr. Cianci will emphasize his record (not his
criminal record) of revitalizing the city's neighborhoods and
its dying downtown. And, he says without irony, he will make
an issue of its worsening crime rate.

   ATLANTA -- A former vendor for a Southern Co. unit who
made illegal political contributions on behalf of the
electric utility pleaded guilty to filing a false corporate
tax return.
   Fred Suttles Jr., president of Outdoor Media Inc., entered
the guilty plea in federal court here and agreed to cooperate
with a continuing federal investigation of the affair.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Outdoor Media, a Pensacola, Fla.-based outdoor advertising
firm, rented billboard space to the Gulf Power Co. unit of
Southern. According to court papers, Mr. Suttles directed his
employees and several of his vendors to contribute $40,550 to
more than a dozen state and local political candidates
designated by Gulf; he then reimbursed the workers and
vendors. The income-tax charge relates to his listing those
reimbursements as legitimate business expenses.
   Court papers filed by the Internal Revenue Service said
Mr. Suttles agreed to the scheme to get Gulf advertising
contracts. The papers said Jacob F. "Jake" Horton, a former
senior vice president of Gulf, asked for the contributions.
Mr. Horton was killed in April 1989 in a corporate plane
crash, the cause of which has yet to be determined.
   The scheme was intended to circumvent federal law, which
prohibits utility holding companies, such as Southern, from
making political contributions.
   Mr. Suttles, who couldn't be reached for comment, faces up
to three years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His plea isn't
apt to affect Gulf Power, which itself pleaded guilty last
fall to two felonies -- conspiracy to make illegal political
contributions and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. of income
taxes. Gulf Power paid a $500,000 fine.
   However, an IRS probe of individuals involved in the
scheme continues, and further charges are anticipated, those
familiar with the investigation said.

   Travelers to Stop
   Writing Policies
   In Nine States

   Travelers Corp. said it will no longer write homeowner and
auto insurance in nine states as part of a major revision of
its personal-lines business.
   The Hartford, Conn.-based insurer is also reducing its
agency force and revamping its commission scale, tying fees
the company pays agents directly to the profitability of the
policies they write.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Travelers has informed the insurance departments in
Arkansas, Idaho, Nevada, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South
Dakota, South Carolina, Wyoming and West Virginia that it's
leaving the auto and homeowner markets. The company said it
had a small share of the auto and homeowner market in these
states and it saw little chance of future growth. In 1989,
$42 million out of the $1.7 billion in personal-lines
premiums came from these nine states.
   Ronald E. Foley, senior vice president in charge of
Travelers' personal lines, said the company wants "to focus
{its} resources on markets where there is the greatest
potential for long-term growth and profitability."
   The withdrawal from the nine states will affect some 230
agents, Travelers said. Earlier this year, the company began
streamlining its entire personal-lines operations,
eliminating 500 to 600 jobs in over 90 field offices
throughout the country. Already some 900 agents are no longer
writing personal insurance for the company.
   The company has already been cutting back its
personal-lines business selectively in a number of states.
It's no longer writing new auto insurance policies in
Pennsylvania and it has nearly completed its withdrawal from
the auto insurance market in California.
   Travelers is adopting a variable commission schedule for
agents selling auto insurance. The company will pay a higher
commission to agents writing profitable policies and less to
those who bring in more risky drivers. Several other insurers
have changed their commission scales, hoping to provide their
agents with some incentive to write better risk and more
profitable business.
   Alice Cornish, an insurance industry analyst with
Northington Partners, said the change in Travelers
commissions scale is far more important because it should
help improve the profitability of its auto book of business.
During the first quarter, Travelers paid out $1.18 in claims
and expenses for every dollar of auto insurance premium
collected. That's worse than the industry average of about
$1.10 in claims and expenses.
   In the 1990 first quarter, the company lost $4 million in
its personal-lines business, compared to net income of $7
million in the year-earlier period. For 1989, it posted a $13
million loss, after earning $29 million from personal lines
in 1988.

   Fears Over Pfizer Heart-Valve Fractures
   Lead to Patients' Suffering and Lawsuits

   A gurgling and clicking noise fills Jean Thornton's
Waterboro, Maine, home and chases her like a ghost. There is
no escape from this haunting sound; it comes from deep within
her own chest.
   Implanted in her heart are two mechanical valves made by
Pfizer Inc., and not a day goes by without her imagining that
they have failed and death is near. Often, her husband drops
what he's doing and gets a stethoscope to listen. "We don't
know from one minute to the next" if the device is working
properly, Charles Thornton says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Thorntons have reason to worry. Eight years ago, their
30-year-old son joined, at last count, at least 260 other
people who have died when their Pfizer-made heart valves
fractured. John Thornton spent his last day building a tree
house for his two small children. But by midnight, in the
back of a speeding ambulance, ashen and gasping for air, he
let go of his father's hand. "I knew he was gone," Mr.
Thornton says.
   Alleged design and manufacturing flaws have made the
Pfizer valve -- known as the Bjork-Shiley Convexo-Concave --
one of the worst medical-device disasters ever. (By
comparison with other heart valves currently in use, the next
most severe case of known structural failure is believed to
have accounted for fewer than 10 deaths.) A total of 86,000
were implanted in people in the U.S. and abroad since the
Food and Drug Administration approved the valve for sale in
1979. It was recalled in 1986.
   The problem has caused untold suffering among people who
wonder whether their valves will operate for another 10
seconds or another 10 years. And though Pfizer defends its
overall handling of the situation, some of its actions have
heightened the emotional fallout to patients and their
families. Among other things, the New York-based
pharmaceutical giant was ill-equipped to issue warnings; by
its own admission, it knows the names of only half the people
equipped with the device.
   The increased patient anxiety has left the company facing
a potentially costly variety of lawsuits, brought by patients
with functioning Bjork-Shiley valves who claim its potential
for failure has caused them emotional distress. Such suits
have been filed on behalf of scores of patients. On May 4, in
one such case, the California Supreme Court refused to
consider Pfizer's objections to this kind of lawsuit, meaning
that the case can go to trial in state court there.
   As word about the heart-valve problem began spreading in
news reports, concerned callers nearly overwhelmed Shiley
Inc., the Pfizer unit that made the valve. When Anne
Cunningham of Las Vegas, Nev., gave Pfizer the serial number
of her 19-year-old son's valve, she says she was told that
valve was in somebody in Spain.
   "The heart-valve problem was paralyzing the company," says
Roger M. Sachs, Pfizer's top expert on the matter.
   Nearly all the 20 heart-valve patients interviewed for
this article learned that their valves could fail, not from
Pfizer or their doctors, but from TV shows or newspaper
articles that disclosed allegations from former Pfizer
employees of shoddy manufacturing work.
   The valve's weakness has thrust into the lives of many
people frightening and persistent thoughts of their own
mortality. The cruel fact: Open-heart surgery to replace the
valve is considered riskier than leaving it in and living
with the odds that it could fail. The company estimates,
based on past valve failures, that each year the chances of a
patient's valve failing range from 0.021% to 1.1%, depending
on the valve's size and date of manufacture.
   Jack Okun, a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel from Sherman
Oaks, Calif., had a valve implanted in 1984 but only learned
of its potential for failure last year. "I am now aware of
practically every heartbeat in my chest and worry if . . .
the valve is or could be failing," Mr. Okun wrote to Rep.
John Dingell, (D., Mich.) whose subcommittee on oversight and
investigations has criticized Pfizer's actions.
   The 69-year-old former fighter pilot says he and his wife
refrain from sex, and he shuns other physical activity. "I
now avoid any debates, arguments, crowded facilities or large
family and professional gatherings as I don't feel that I am
emotionally capable of handling these situations. I have
become very introspective and somewhat bitter."
   The same predicament has Kathleen Langlitz, a 59-year old
legal secretary from New Rochelle, N.Y., questioning her own
mental stability. "I get so concerned in the middle of the
night. I find myself moaning," Mrs. Langlitz says, beginning
to cry, "and I realize I'm doing it to hear my own voice, to
make sure I'm alive. I come downstairs and get the
stethoscope to listen to it."
   Mechanical heart valves are about as old as manned space
flight, and have saved or improved the lives of hundreds of
thousands. Many people report an almost giddy feeling of
freedom after a valve implant cures their constant fatigue,
periodic bouts with congestive heart failure and other
ailments. The steady clicking can be reassuring. A flawed
valve, however, can be deadly -- two-thirds of Bjork-Shiley
fractures have resulted in death.
   Pfizer says about 500 of the very highest-risk valves were
sold -- all outside the U.S. Valves sold in the U.S. have, at
worst, a 0.295% annual failure rate, Pfizer estimates.
Pfizer's figures, however, could be much lower than the
actual number of deaths. The symptoms of valve failure aren't
much different from some other kinds of severe cardiac
distress. And unless someone suspects a valve problem, it's
unlikely an autopsy would be done to examine the valve.
   Pfizer routinely pays settlements -- it won't discuss the
terms -- to families of patients who die from valve fractures
and to patients who survive fractures. But Pfizer says it
won't settle anxiety claims. At issue are not only charges of
poor design and manufacturing, but allegations that Pfizer
was tardy in notifying the FDA and doctors of valve
fractures.
   Dr. Sachs denies all of these charges and asserts that
"the patients who have these valves are not at a greater
overall risk than they thought they were." While the
Bjork-Shiley is more prone to fracture than other valves, he
says it is less likely than other valves to induce
life-threatening blood clots. The valves originally sold for
about $2,000 each, and there are about 55,000 people still
living with implants.
   Pfizer isn't trying to contact patients directly. Instead,
the company says it relies on doctors to tell their patients
about the possibility of fracture, its symptoms and what to
do. On March 30, it sent out 273,800 copies of a letter with
such information to doctors and emergency medical workers in
the U.S., up from a mailing to just 5,000 cardiologists in
August 1989.
   It seems likely, however, that thousands of patients with
the valve still don't know of its potential for failure, and
therefore wouldn't know what lifesaving steps to take if
their valve did fracture.
   Fred Barbee says his wife died because of such ignorance.
When Carol Barbee collapsed in April 1988, Mr. Barbee drove
her to the emergency room nearest their Minong, Wis., home --
directly south in Spooner. But open-heart surgery couldn't be
performed there, and after a delay she had to be taken back
north to Duluth, Minn., where she died.
   "Her {brain} was dead by the time she got here," says Per
Wickstrom, Mrs. Barbee's Duluth surgeon. He can't say for
sure whether she would have survived the valve fracture had
she come straight to Duluth. "But it would have been nice to
operate on her earlier."
   Aside from worrying, what can be done? Kenneth Merz, a
former TRW Inc. research scientist with two Pfizer valves in
his heart, has tried to channel his concern into a useful
pursuit -- figuring out how to detect whether and when
they'll fail.
   The Bjork-Shiley valve is a ring sewn into the heart, with
a disk inside that opens and closes about 40 million times a
year to let blood flow. Two metal struts control the disk. It
is believed that, in failing, first one side of the smaller
strut breaks and the valve continues working for some time
until the additional stress on the remaining side of the
strut breaks it as well, and the disk breaks free.
   Mr. Merz reasons that a properly functioning valve makes a
distinct and constant sound that can be recorded. If
researchers could figure out the approximate time between the
first side of a strut breaking and the second one, they could
do regular acoustic tests on Bjork-Shiley patients. When the
sound changes, indicating one side is broken, there would be
time to perform valve-replacement surgery before the second
side breaks.
   Mr. Merz says he asked Pfizer for its research data but
hasn't gotten any yet. "They're stonewalling." He has no
plans to sue over anxiety. "I'd rather sue to force them to
do something -- to get {them to} design a test that detects
failure."
   Dr. Sachs says Mr. Merz's proposed approach is precisely
one of the detection avenues Pfizer is looking into. By later
this year, he says, the company expects to know if it's
feasible, though actually putting together testing equipment
would take more time. The company will share its data with
anyone who has a reasonable and well-designed research
proposal, Dr Sachs says. "The worry is that {a poorly
designed test} will stampede patients into risky and needless
surgery."
   Marie Johnson had a premonition after seeing a Jan. 1,
1987, segment about the valve on ABC's "20/20" show. The next
year, she needed surgery to replace a separate pigskin valve,
and she says she asked her doctor to remove her Bjork-Shiley
since her chest was going to be open. He declined, she says,
telling her it would prolong an already risky operation.
   Seven months later, on the morning of March 1, 1989, she
was watching television, "trying to decide whether to go
upstairs and take a shower and set my hair, or whether to
clean the house first. All of a sudden . . . I can only tell
you what I didn't feel. I felt no pain. Not dizzy. Not hot. I
could still think. All I know was something was going on in
my body that was different. I felt my chest. My heart was
still beating."
   "I knew I'd better call my doctor or I was going to die,"
she says. An ambulance took her the 3.3 miles to Parkview
Memorial Hospital's regional trauma and heart center in Fort
Wayne, Ind. After a series of tests and X-rays, she underwent
open-heart surgery to replace a fractured Bjork-Shiley
Convexo-Concave valve. The disk itself shot down her aorta
and was recovered from her groin area, and a broken strut was
later removed from her arm.
   Mrs. Johnson is now 60, but she looks older and a little
confused, a rare survivor of an aortic-valve failure. She has
had three recent bouts with congestive heart failure, and
says she tires too easily to enjoy spending the settlement
she received from Shiley. "My powers of concentration are
shot. I have to read the same sentence several times to
understand what I read. Then," she says in the darkness of
her living room, "I forget anyway." The grandchildren she
used to baby-sit still drop by, but "they get on my nerves
now. I can't stand to have them around."

   McDonnell Sets
   Major Layoffs
   To Slash Costs

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it will try to save $700
million a year through "substantial layoffs" and other
measures.
   In a memo to employees yesterday, John McDonnell,
chairman, cited "potentially serious cost problems" on
fixed-price development pacts with the Pentagon, including
the A-12 attack jet, the C-17 cargo plane and the T-45
trainer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He also referred to the fact that the company, though
laden with debt, will have to invest $2 billion this year on
the MD-11 passenger jet. "Furthermore," he said, "our MD-80
delivery rates and costs are not yet satisfactory."
   Mr. McDonnell added that a corporatewide restructuring
launched with much fanfare almost 18 months ago is "a long
way from realizing its full potential." Indeed, the most
radical reorganization has occurred at the company's
transport-aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach, Calif., and the
unit has been the company's biggest loser quarter after
quarter.
   "The hard reality," Mr. McDonnell wrote, "is we must begin
immediately to take further strong actions to reduce our
costs."
   At the end of 1989, according to McDonnell Douglas's
financial records, the St. Louis concern had expenses
totaling $14.71 billion; that would mean a $700 million
reduction is equal to about 5% of the company's cost
structure.
   "At least that's a start," said First Boston Corp.
aerospace analyst Peter Aseritis, who last week lowered his
1990 earnings estimate for McDonnell Douglas. Because of a
disclosure by the Navy that there is a problem with the A-12,
he is now looking for a $2.25-a-share loss for the year,
instead of a $3-a-share profit.
   Carving out $700 million is "a pretty strong step," said
George Shapiro, of Salomon Brothers Inc. "But I don't think
they have any other choice," he said.
   Mr. McDonnell said a recent move to cut 4,000 jobs in Long
Beach and eliminate 3,000 contract-labor positions there
already has helped the company meet its cost-savings
objective. But, he asserted, additional actions need to be
taken at every division in areas such as overtime, travel,
new hiring, consultants, advertising and support activities.
   And the bottom line, he said, is that "to reduce costs by
the desired amount will entail substantial layoffs across the
corporation." A company spokesman declined to be more
specific. But late last night, Mike Schoen, an assistant
business representative for the Machinists union District 837
in St. Louis, said he understood that 4,000 slots, mostly
white-collar, could be eliminated from the company's Missouri
fighter plant alone. The factory has about 40,000 workers,
and McDonnell Douglas employs more than 130,000 people
overall.
   Mr. McDonnell explained in his letter -- addressed, as is
his custom, "to all teammates" -- that because "the
prospective layoffs are driven by ongoing unsatisfactory
business results rather than by productivity improvements, we
will not be offering voluntary retirement severance
programs."
   "If possible, we will do what we can to help those
displaced," he said, "but we cannot guarantee jobs where none
exist." A number of military projects at McDonnell Douglas,
the nation's No. 1 military contractor, are slated to be axed
by the Pentagon.
   A turnaround at McDonnell Douglas couldn't come too soon.
Although it has been promising improved performance for some
time, the company's debt-to-equity ratio is now almost
1-to-1, and its stock is trading at less than half its book
value.
   After tumbling on the A-12 news all last week, McDonnell
Douglas shares closed in composite trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange at $39.50, up 87.5 cents. The company
didn't make known its latest plans until hours after the
market had closed.
   Mr. McDonnell, who began meeting yesterday with top
executives to search for places to save money, said he hopes
to have a complete strategy in place by early August.

   China's Most Outspoken Dissident, Hero
   Of Tiananmen, Flees to Native Taiwan

   TAIPEI -- Chinese pop star Hou Dejian, a Taiwan native who
defected to China seven years ago only to become the
mainland's most outspoken dissident last summer, has fled
back to the island on a fishing boat, Taiwan's state-owned
radio and television reported.
   Mr. Hou's whereabouts and details of his escape weren't
immediately clear. Taiwanese television stations reported
that he had turned himself in to the Taipei prosecutor's
office last night after visiting his mother. They said he had
been arrested and was being detained for entering Taiwan
without a visa, but police denied that report.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Whatever his immediate circumstances, Mr. Hou's return
could pose a dilemma for local officials torn between
welcoming him home or prosecuting him as a traitor because of
his 1983 defection. He could also be charged with violating
national security laws for entering Taiwan without a visa.
   But Mr. Hou, 33 years old, is viewed as a hero in Taiwan
because of his role in helping some students escape last
year's massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. On
the night of June 4, he negotiated the students' peaceful
retreat from Tiananmen Square with military officers. That
exploit, and his subsequent emergence as China's leading
dissenter, was described in a page one story in this
newspaper last month.
   Because of his intervention on behalf of the students,
political analysts here said it is unlikely he will be
prosecuted -- if he goes to court at all. Government
spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said only that his fate is uncertain.
"What he did on June 4 was courageous," Mr. Shaw said. "But
if there are legal entanglements, that will have to be
decided by judicial authorities."
   People close to Mr. Hou said he left Taiwan because his
marriage was breaking up and because he was angry that Taipei
censors had changed the lyrics in one of his songs. His
defection was a major embarrassment for the ruling
Kuomintang, which had embraced his most famous song,
"Descendants of the Dragon," as a patriotic inspiration, and
then felt obliged to ban it for several years.
   In the aftermath of the massacre in Beijing, Mr. Hou's
fame as a pop star and his unique status as a defector from
Taiwan kept him out of jail as other dissidents were being
rounded up. He thus became the most visible person in China
willing to publicly criticize the government. In interviews
with foreign reporters, he referred to China's leaders as
"mad dogs" and called paramount leader Deng Xiaoping a
"killer."
   Mr. Hou and two other dissidents disappeared May 30, on
the eve of a news conference scheduled to demand the release
of political prisoners. The other two -- Gao Xin, a former
university newspaper editor, and Zhou Duo, a former
university lecturer -- had served time in prison after the
June military crackdown. Both men resurfaced this week and
returned home -- Mr. Zhou on Monday and Mr. Gao yesterday.

   WASHINGTON -- The House cast a solid vote for overriding
President Bush's veto of a bill that would ease restrictions
on political activity by federal workers, but the real test
comes in the Senate today.
   The House voted 327-93 to override the veto, which was Mr.
Bush's 12th since taking office. The Senate, which voted
67-30 for the bill last month, is scheduled to vote today on
overriding the veto, and Democratic proponents of the measure
and Republican opponents both say the outcome will be very
close. As in the House, a veto override requires at least a
two-thirds vote.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Senate vote would have been 68-32 with all senators
voting, based on later statements by the three senators who
didn't vote. Those favoring the legislation included all 55
Democrats and 13 Republicans, while 32 Republicans opposed
it. So two of the 13 Republicans will have to join their GOP
colleagues in a vote to sustain the veto, assuming no other
switches occur.
   The bill vetoed by Mr. Bush was the more-modest Senate
version, accepted by the House last week. It would let
federal employees engage in more off-the-job political
activity, including holding positions in political parties,
attending party conventions as delegates and raising money
from fellow union members. But running for elective office
would still generally be banned. And on-the-job political
activity, such as wearing a campaign button at work, wouldn't
be permitted anymore.

   MCI Unveils Plan to Give Small Business
   Long-Distance Service Used by Big Firms

   WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. rolled out a
long-distance service designed to give small- and
medium-sized business customers features that generally had
been available only to big companies.
   The new service, called MCI Vision, is based on a flat
per-minute charge and is targeted at companies that spend
between $500 and $50,000 a month on long-distance service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Timothy Price, MCI's vice president for general business,
said the package includes flat-rate pricing, volume
discounts, virtual private-line services, and a comprehensive
bill that lists credit-card calls as well as domestic and
international long-distance charges for all of a company's
branch offices. Calls can be tracked by employee, departments
or calling cards.
   The $18 billion smaller-business segment of the
long-distance industry is getting more attention as
competition has squeezed margins in the residential and
big-business segments. "MCI is focusing its sales force on
the middle market because that's where the richest margins
are," said Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley. "Frankly, the
margins are drying up in the high end."
   Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber, said the MCI
move shows that competition is shifting away from price
cutting. "This isn't some deep discount," he said. "It's an
attempt to bring down functionality to a lower market
segment." MCI, he said, is "clearly reacting to AT&amp;T's
success in defending its share of the middle market."
   While American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s share of the
middle market is about 50%, MCI figures it has 14% to 15%. To
increase its share, MCI has beefed up its sales force by
about 500 since the beginning of the year, Mr. Price said.
   At AT&amp;T, Joseph Nacchio, vice president-marketing for
business communications services, said AT&amp;T could replicate
the MCI package in a couple of days, but wants to watch MCI's
performance first. "We were waiting for some killer product,"
he said. "But I didn't find anyone here lying down because
bullets were flying."
   Investors apparently expected a more significant
announcement as well. MCI's shares fell 87.5 cents to $41.625
in national over-the-counter trading. AT&amp;T's shares rose 37.5
cents to $43.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
   To promote the new service, MCI launched a
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign developed by Wells,
Rich, Greene Inc. The campaign, which uses the tag line
"Big-business long distance for your business," includes 15-
and 30-second television spots. The spots are being aired
during network morning and evening news shows and sports
programs, as well as CNN business shows and ESPN baseball
games. The company also has a print campaign that will be run
in newspapers and local business journals.
   Among the MCI Vision features is a "hotline" service that
allows a caller to connect automatically to a telephone in
another city. Another is a "remote" service that allows a
company to maintain a local number that actually rings at a
distant location. If a company does a lot of business in one
city, but doesn't want to maintain an office there, it can
set up a number that would be answered at the company's main
office.
   Basic rates for domestic service are 20 cents a minute
between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. for direct dialed calls into the
MCI network and 15 cents for calls placed through a direct
connection between the customer and the MCI network. Off-peak
calls are 20% less. Rates for international calls are based
on the destination, time of day and type of access to the MCI
network. MCI also is offering customers the option of
delivering bills on paper or magnetic tape.
   "This is a one-size fits-all product," Mr. Price said. "It
can grow as the company grows. Some companies that end up
buying this product may not use every feature -- yet."
   Earlier this year, in another major attempt to gain market
share in the general business market, MCI announced plans to
acquire Telecom USA for $1.25 billion.

   NAACP Raps 2 Live Crew, Reflecting
   Division Among Blacks Over the Music

   Until now, mainstream black leaders and civil rights
groups have been conspicuously absent from the debate over
whether certain rap-music lyrics are obscene.
   But yesterday, the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People broke that silence -- and its
response provides no comfort to embattled rap group 2 Live
Crew, which is fighting obscenity charges in South Florida
and elsewhere.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Our cultural experience does not include debasing our
women, the glorification of violence, the promotion of
deviant sexual behavior or the tearing into shreds of our
cherished mores and standards of behavior," says NAACP
Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks in a statement, which
otherwise reiterates the NAACP's support for First Amendment
rights.
   Mr. Hooks's statement seems to reflect a fundamental
disagreement in the black community over whether the
ultra-raw lyrics of many rap songs legitimately reflect the
black cultural experience.
   Many middle-class blacks identify strongly with values
they link to upward mobility -- family, work and faith. They
say they are put off by the celebration of values from the
streets, including violence and exploitation of women, that
inform much of rap music. And they have been indifferent, at
best, to 2 Live Crew's call for support of what the rap group
claims to be an African-American art form.
   When 2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell appeared on a
television talk show Monday to defend his controversial
album, "As Nasty As They Wanna Be," NAACP headquarters in
Baltimore was besieged with phone calls. The callers "took
offense at his attributing these sentiments to black culture
and wrapping it in the mantle of black tradition," says an
NAACP spokesman.
   The NAACP response didn't surprise Henry Louis Gates Jr.,
a professor of English at Duke University who's considered
one of the leading scholars on African-American literature.
He says this type of conflict goes back as far as the Harlem
Renaissance in the 1920s, when middle-class progressive
figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, one of the NAACP's founders,
maintained that black art must serve the aims of political
and social advancement.
   Mr. DuBois criticized blues music from the fields as
setting blacks back, especially in the eyes of whites, Mr.
Gates says. Middle-class blacks today take a similar view, he
says. They don't feel "a revulsion to obscenity {in rap},
it's a revulsion to a reminder of roots that they'd rather
suppress." Mr. Gates, who doesn't excuse the sexism in
"Nasty," maintains that the lyrics are squarely within the
black vernacular tradition.
   Mr. Gates sees a greater danger in the cool reaction of
middle-class leaders than in the record's possible obscenity.
Racism lies at the root of the attacks on the rap group, he
says, adding, "The failure to defend 2 Live Crew reveals the
ignorance of how dangerous this case is to us all."
   Some other black opinion leaders agree that whether the
album is African-American art or obscenity, 2 Live Crew must
be defended. "The snowballing legal actions against them
nationwide puts us on the slippery slope of the majority
defining what is art -- and for a minority that's a dangerous
position to be in," says Robert Johnson, president of Black
Entertainment Television, the black-oriented cable service
that reaches 30 million homes.
   Set against this view are those of some black social
thinkers who say that defending the lyrics as art reinforces
values that are destroying the black "underclass," the group
rap music claims to represent.
   "It does make me squeamish," says San Francisco
sociologist Nathan Hare at the thought of 2 Live Crew lawyer
Bruce Rogow arguing in court that use of the term "bitch" for
a female is a cultural norm for the black underclass. The
term, used 163 times on the album, is one of its kinder
references to women. "It's not black art, it's art that some
young black people are practicing now," says Mr. Hare. He
adds that "we like chitterlings {a stew of pig intestines},
but that doesn't mean it's good food."
   Most rap music doesn't contain anywhere near the level of
graphic acts of male sexual dominance that 2 Live Crew
features. Since its emergence in the late 1970s, rap lyrics
have moved rapidly from harmless chants about the rapper's
prowess with a microphone and turntables to stories of ghetto
alienation and most recently to assertions of "Afrocentric"
values. These have often included anti-drug and anti-violence
themes. But songs that push an image of black male potency
based on female exploitation, like "Pimpin' Ain't Easy" on
Big Daddy Kane's latest album, also have been an unquestioned
staple of the repertoire until "Nasty" became the first album
to be ruled obscene by a judge.
   "Rap has always been on a collision course" with
middle-class values, both black and white, says Village Voice
writer Barry Michael Cooper. "That's where it gets its edge."
He adds, "I'm glad this is happening, because it's going to
make rap artists re-examine where they're coming from and
rethink their values."
   Washington Post columnist Courtland Milloy, who writes
about black social issues and who came down hard on 2 Live
Crew in his column last week, also looks forward to the
coming debate over rap's place in the black community. "It's
futile to try to suppress this thing with court action. But
if this case can be used to get people on the record saying
we don't like having young black men talking about abusing
women and girls, and by extension themselves, then let the
trials begin."

   A federal judge this week sentenced the former president
of a defunct unit of Enron Corp. to one year and one day in
jail for his part in an oil trading scam that cost the
company more than $140 million.
   Louis Borget pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and income
tax violations stemming from accusations that he and other
officials of the Enron Oil Corp. unit created sham trades and
falsified documents for personal financial gain. The sentence
was imposed by Judge Gerard Goettel in the federal court in
White Plains, N.Y.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Enron declined comment on the matter, citing pending civil
litigation against Mr. Borget. Enron Oil, an international
oil trading unit, was discontinued in 1987.
   In addition to the jail sentence, Mr. Borget received five
years of probation and was ordered to pay $5.9 million
restitution. He has 30 days to surrender.

   The Hatch Vote

   Forget the vote on the flag amendment for a moment. Today
the Senate is scheduled to vote on something that could do a
lot more to define the future political character of the
United States. It's the old Hatch Act. President Bush has
already vetoed a bill to repeal the act's prohibitions on
political activity by federal employees. The House overrode
the veto yesterday, by a whopping and revealing 327 to 93
vote. The vote in the Senate today is expected to be closer.
The outcome will tell the public much about whose interests
the modern Congress represents these days.
   The bill that Mr. Bush vetoed would let some three million
federal and postal workers hold party offices and solicit
money from co-workers for federal workers' PACs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This, of course, is taking place at the very moment that
Congress is in a budget summit with the White House to get
control of the Titanic $1.2 trillion federal budget. That
budget pays for what all these three million federal workers
do. Is Congress serious? Probably not very about controlling
the budget, but we suspect the Members, particularly the
Democrats, are quite serious about transforming public
workers into voting constituents. Term limitations, anyone?
   But there is also a philosophical relationship between the
out-of-control federal budget and this effort to repeal the
Hatch Act. In political capitals around the world today --
Moscow, Warsaw, Prague, Mexico City, London, Brasilia,
Washington, Albany, Trenton -- the issue on the table is the
public sector's claim on incomes. In every case there is at
least recognition now that the public commitment -- and
usually what we're talking about here is the size of the
public workforce -- is too large and too expensive. Public
budgets everywhere are cracking under this weight.
   What is by no means settled is whether the politicians who
are elected to represent private citizens have the will to
gain control over this public colossus. President Salinas of
Mexico has shown extraordinary political courage to date in
trying to wean his country off dependency on public
institutions and publicly subsidized jobs. But the House of
Representatives by its vote yesterday on Mr. Bush's Hatch
veto makes plain what many voters suspect: It does not have
the will to control public-sector growth. Its Members'
incumbency, which is to say their careers, is now dependent
on the power that such a large legislative and bureaucratic
state confers.
   Obviously there is a partisan interest in overturning the
Hatch Act. Public employees' unions have become the most
vibrant source of political support for Democratic
presidential candidates in the wake of the effort by the
teachers' unions to help elect Jimmy Carter. Beneath this
lies the continuing Democratic assumption that most problems
-- the homeless, the environment, welfare dependency, failed
schools, health costs -- will be righted merely with a larger
public commitment, which is to say by hiring more public
workers to lay their hands on the problems in perpetuity. The
Democrats now want federal employees to be able to lobby for
more of this.
   The vote in the Senate today will reveal whether Congress
wishes to send the U.S. further into this public-sector dream
world or get on with the business of scaling back the state
and its unsupportable costs.

   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. boosted to $2.25
billion from $1.5 billion its unusual offering of zero-coupon
bonds convertible into cash tied to the market price of Euro
Disneyland S.C.A., a publicly held French company.
   The offering size was increased at the request of Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., the issue underwriter, because of investor
demand, Disney said. Even before the offering was increased,
it was believed to be the largest convertible bond issue
ever.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gross proceeds are expected to be about $927 million,
Disney said. In addition, the entertainment concern has
granted an option to Merrill Lynch to acquire additional
notes to cover overallotments, which, if fully exercised,
would increase the offering to $2.59 billion, with gross
proceeds of about $1.07 billion.
   Disney has said the funds would be used for capital
spending and to retire more expensive commercial paper
outstanding. In January, Walt Disney announced a
multibillion-dollar expansion of its theme parks and resorts
in Florida and California over the next decade.
   The bonds, called Liquid Yield Option Notes, pay a yield
of 6% to maturity. They have been priced at $411.99, and will
be exchangeable for cash equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent
of the market value of 19.65 shares of Euro Disneyland common
stock.
   Euro Disneyland, a theme park and resort complex near
Paris, is scheduled to open in 1992. The company is listed on
stock exchanges in Paris, London and Brussels, and is 49%
owned by Walt Disney Co. It closed at the equivalent of
$18.23 on the Paris exchange.

   NEW YORK -- National Patent Development Corp. said it
began an exchange offer for a bond issue to try to reduce its
long-term debt and interest expense, and to give it more
"financial flexibility."
   The holding company said the offer is for its 7% dual
currency convertible bonds due March 18, 1996. For each
$3,000 principal amount of bonds tendered, National Patent
will exchange an as-yet-to-be-determined number of its common
shares with a par value of one cent a share and a market
value of $1,800 and warrants to purchase 300 shares of newly
issued common with a par value of one cent a share in
Interferon Sciences Inc., National Patent's 82%-controlled
subsidiary. The National Patent shares will be priced five
days before the offer closes Aug. 10; the Interferon warrants
are exercisable until Aug. 16, 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As of March 31, there were $10.9 million of the bonds
outstanding. If all of the bonds are tendered, National
Patent will realize an extraordinary gain of about $1.9
million. National Patent's long-term debt was about $85
million at the end of March. The company had 1989 sales of
about $278 million.
   National Patent said it agreed to reduce the $9 million
debt Interferon owes it, by $240 for each $3,000 in bonds
tendered. Interferon Sciences is a biotechnology concern that
focuses on developing and manufacturing interferon-based
products to treat viral diseases, cancer and immune system
deficiencies.
   National Patent shares closed yesterday ex-dividend at
$5.75, down 12.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite
trading. Interferon Sciences shares traded at $8.125 bid in
over-the-counter trading.

   President Bush reportedly is pondering whether to be a
major donor to Francois Mitterrand's "Save Gorbachev" fund.
We can suggest two questions:
   1. Which Mikhail Gorbachev are we trying to save, the
liberal or the conservative?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   2. Exactly how would a large sum -- $20 billion is being
bruited about -- accomplish that task?
   President Mitterrand's interview in yesterday's Le Monde
raised the specter of a world-wide impact if President
Gorbachev fails to master the current Soviet crisis. No
disagreement there, but the world has been feeling the impact
of Mr. Gorbachev's inability to control events for some time
now. Not all of the consequences have been unwelcome. A
democratic Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, a reunified
Germany and a reduced Soviet military presence in Asia,
Africa and Central Europe are results of a loss of Soviet
control that we rather like.
   We are fully aware of the ominous trends, however. Some
people living within Soviet boundaries are hungry. Famine in
some areas is possible. In such events, industrial nations
would be justified in insisting on direct relief flights to
distressed areas and direct supervision over food
distribution. That too would be expensive, but the money
spent would achieve immediate results. The West is not
without debt to Mikhail Gorbachev, but most of all it owes,
and can afford, humanitarian aid to any starving populace.
   Meeting such a contingency, however, is totally different
from pumping $20 billion into some further vague Gorbachev
"economic reform." He has been talking of perestroika for
five years now, while at the same time upholding Communist
rule, something that is antithetical to true reform. Is this
the kind of reformer the West should want to back with $20
billion?
   Andrei Anikin, a Russian scholar and author, graphically
describes the current chaotic state of Soviet political and
economic affairs in an article nearby. Mr. Gorbachev
yesterday threatened to step down as leader of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) if things don't go his way.
The same threat surfaced in January just before a crucial
central committee meeting, although then it was merely a leak
to the CNN news network that was later denied. The ploy
worked in January, but this time it might backfire. As
Professor Anikin notes, Mr. Gorbachev is not as popular at
home as he is abroad.
   Should he give up party leadership, Mr. Gorbachev still
would have his five-year term as president of the Soviet
Union. But the survival of the "union" also is in doubt. With
no visible exceptions, the non-Russian republics want out.
Gorbachev rival Boris Yeltsin has won the presidency of the
vast Russian Federation. Part of yesterday's CPSU agenda was
to create a separate Russian Communist Party. In short, the
fragmentation of the Soviet Union is proceeding apace, and
Mr. Gorbachev, as president, soon may have little left to
govern.
   Should it be the business of Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Bush
to halt Soviet fragmentation? It hardly seems so. The seizure
of property and power by local authorities -- a process of de
facto decentralization that already is well under way -- may
be the only hope for averting total collapse. The trading
arrangements these authorities are making independently of
central power could save some areas from exactly the kinds of
calamities that President Mitterrand has every cause to fear.
   On the level of Realpolitik, a case can be made for
funneling some money to the Soviets in exchange for their
acceptance of German NATO membership and a full withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Germany. The Germans are appalled when
anyone publicly describes that as their purpose, fearing that
it makes Mr. Gorbachev look like an extortionist. But we are
talking about Realpolitik, not definitions of crime, and full
withdrawal of the Red Army from Central Europe could be worth
$20 billion.
   As to saving the Gorbachev reforms, the people supporting
such a move first must answer the question, what reforms?

   Breakdown in Talks

   BOULDER, Colo. -- Daisy Systems Corp. edged closer to
bankruptcy court proceedings, acknowledging a breakdown in
negotiations with bondholders and a secured creditor over its
default on $118 million in debt.
   The company also said that Heller Financial, its secured
lender, has notified Daisy that it will not extend a
"standstill agreement" that ended June 15 and will not
guarantee its purchase of workstations from Sun Microsystems
Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The announcement apparently clears the way for a June 26
court hearing on a petition for involuntary bankruptcy, filed
by Daisy's bondholders May 30. The maker of computer-aided
engineering stations has missed interest payments since
November.
   According to a company spokesman, Daisy's cash shortage is
severe enough to prevent its customary purchase of Sun
Microsystem workstations. As a result, domestic shipments of
its products in the third quarter, ending June 30, "will be
significantly less" than in the quarter ended March 31. The
second quarter saw a slump in revenue to $33 million, from
$47.2 million a year earlier.
   Daisy's troubles began with its optimistic $200 million
acquisition of Cadnetix Corp. at the end of 1988, but
disappointing sales have left it unable to service its debt.
Although the company spokesman said Daisy is seeking
third-party funds, he acknowledged that company officials are
not optimistic and that failure to find help soon means Daisy
"will be unable to continue normal operations."

   Perhaps the only good news coming out of the S&amp;L mess is
that it has awakened some policy makers to the $863 billion
in potential liabilities piled up by such entities as Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac and Sallie Mae.
   Last month, a Treasury study of their financial safety and
soundness concluded that these off-budget lending
institutions must adopt stricter capital standards, a credit
rating not based on their taxpayer guarantees and full
disclosure in the federal budget. It makes little sense to
allow these entities to operate as private-sector companies
and still be backed up by federal guarantees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, some of them already have started wheeling out
their lobbying guns. Three House committee chairmen -- Henry
Gonzalez and Kika de la Garza of Texas and Gus Hawkins of
California -- have written Speaker Foley demanding that
reform of these government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, be
taken off the table at the budget summit. That way any reform
proposals will have to be routed through their committees,
where they can be "modified."
   The sudden concern of these committee chairmen for the
prerogatives of these agencies is striking. Save for when the
Farm Credit System went bust in 1985, no one at their
respective committees could recall the last time any of them
held an oversight hearing on their financial condition. Given
the lack of attention that GSEs have received to date, the
budget summit negotiators would be remiss if they didn't put
reforming them high up on the agenda.

   WASHINGTON -- The National Association of Securities
Dealers, in a move cheered by shareholder groups, said it
plans to introduce a "one-share, one-vote" rule similar to
that recently struck down by a federal appeals court panel.
   In an interview, NASD President Joseph Hardiman said the
group is eager to maintain the rule despite last week's
appeals court decision that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had overstepped its authority in adopting the
rule. He said he expects to present "reasonably promptly" a
proposal to the NASD advisory board and board of governors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move comes at a time when many on Wall Street expected
the court ruling to reignite a battle among U.S. exchanges to
lure companies to list shares. Exchanges could use relaxed
listing requirements as incentives to companies concerned
about hostile takeovers.
   But Mr. Hardiman said the NASD "is not going to trigger a
race to the bottom" in listing standards. "We will abide by
19c4 {the one-share, one-vote rule} as long as it is in
effect, and if appeals fail we hope to adopt a similar rule,"
he said.
   Mr. Hardiman said that part of the reason behind the move
is an agreement that the NASD has with states that allows the
over-the-counter market exemptions from state securities
laws. If the NASD adopts rules of corporate governance that
are more lenient than those of the exchanges, he said, NASD
dealers will fall under tougher scrutiny from state
regulators.
   Mr. Hardiman quickly added, however, that his stance "has
to be tempered by what the competition is doing." The New
York Stock Exchange adopted its own version of one-share,
one-vote after the SEC rule went into effect, but the
American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq didn't.
   Amex Chairman James Jones said the exchange is still
studying the court's decision. He added, "But the fact that
we haven't made a decision doesn't mean one thing either
way."
   A Big Board spokeswoman said: "We don't see things
changing immediately. We don't see many companies that would
want to do anything with their corporate structure that would
fall under the 19c4 rule. If they do, we would review the
rules as the situation arises."
   An SEC spokeswoman said the agency is "pleased" with the
NASD's action but declined to comment further. She said the
agency hadn't yet decided whether to appeal the court's
decision.
   The SEC's rule prohibited already traded companies from
issuing a class of common stock with lesser voting rights.
That practice had become common in the mid-1980s as a
takeover defense. But the SEC's rule was challenged by the
Business Roundtable, a trade group of large companies, which
argued that the federal rule overstepped the traditional
rights of states in corporate governance. The appeals court
agreed.
   The SEC rule never precluded public offerings from having
two classes, because shareholders buying into those offerings
would know of the limited voting rights. The agency's
argument for 19c4 was that holders shouldn't have rights
taken away when they bought the stock under other conditions.
   The NASD plan met with applause from shareholder groups.
"That was what we had pressed for: That the exchanges would
do this on their own without regulation," said Ralph
Whitworth of United Shareholders Association. "We believe
that dual-class voting is the ultimate
management-entrenchment device."
   He added that he expects the move to put pressure on the
Amex to abide by a one-share, one-vote rule, especially if
the Big Board holds the line on its 19c4-type rule.

   Midlantic Expects
   To Post `Modest Loss'
   For Second Quarter

   EDISON, N.J. -- Midlantic Corp., citing "significant" new
reserves for possible loan losses, said it expects to report
"a modest loss" for the second quarter.
   The bank holding company is one of the major New Jersey
lenders to developer Donald Trump, who has been in a cash
squeeze and is holding negotiations with his lenders. But
Donald W. Ebbert Jr., senior vice president at Midlantic,
said the expected second-quarter loss isn't connected to the
Trump loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the expected loss, Midlantic declared its
quarterly dividend of 47 cents a share on common and said it
expects "to maintain adequate coverage for non-performing
assets."
   A year earlier, net income was $61.6 million, or $1.57 a
share on a fully diluted basis. For all of 1989, net was
$206.3 million, or $5.27 a share.
   Net plunged in this year's first quarter to $1.4 million,
or one cent a share, from $59.5 million, or $1.53 a share,
fully diluted, a year earlier.
   In the first quarter, the company increased its loss
reserves with a provision of $108 million. At the time, it
cited "continuing concerns about current business conditions,
a further decline in the real estate market and an increase
in Midlantic's nonperforming loans."
   Midlantic said the office of the Comptroller of the
Currency is scheduled to examine the company next month "and
the outcome of that review will be communicated to
shareholders at the appropriate time."
   In April, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the
debt ratings of Midlantic and its units.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Midlantic closed at
$15.75, up 50 cents.

   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved
use of the drug levamisole for certain colon cancer patients.
   The drug is manufactured by Janssen Research Foundation, a
unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J. It is already
on the market for use in removing parasitic worms from cows,
pigs, and other farm animals. It is also an approved
anti-worming drug for humans in the U.S., but the chief
market for that use is the Third World, according to a
Janssen spokesman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the new FDA approval, levamisole will be used in
combination with a generic drug, fluorouracil, to treat colon
cancer patients who have undergone surgery and whose cancer
has spread to lymph nodes. The FDA estimates this group to
number 21,000 in the U.S.
   Levamisole's effectiveness in treating colon cancer
patients was demonstrated in trials conducted by the federal
government's National Cancer Institute. The results were
published earlier this year in the New England Journal of
Medicine.

   Insurers Could Lose Antitrust Exemption
   Under Bill Cleared by House Committee

CONGRESS (CNG)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee narrowly
passed legislation that would repeal major portions of the
insurance industry's exemption from federal antitrust law.
   The committee's action, by a 19-17 vote, poses the biggest
threat the insurance industry has ever faced to the antitrust
exemption, passed by Congress as the McCarran-Ferguson Act in
1945.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Congress can no longer ignore the widespread economic
dislocation caused by premiums that are unreasonably high --
or policies that are unavailable at any price," said Rep.
Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat and Judiciary Committee
chairman, who sponsored the new legislation.
   Approval of the bill set the stage for a battle in the
full House, possibly in late summer. But if the measure
passes the House, over strong opposition, a Senate proposal
also faces a tough fight. Consumer groups that support the
legislation concede that the best they may be able to hope
for is passage by the House this year, and a quick start in
the new Congress next year.
   The bill passed the committee despite opposition by all 14
of the Republicans on the 36-member panel. The measure was
supported by 19 Democrats, and was opposed by three
Democrats.
   The legislation would repeal insurers' exemptions for the
practices that are generally deemed by antitrust experts to
be most anti-competitive. These include price-fixing,
allocating geographic regions among competing companies,
attempting to monopolize markets, and requiring consumers to
buy insurance packages that include policies they don't
really want.
   The proposal would allow insurance companies to continue
sharing some basic information about claims and economic
trends, while phasing out the sharing of some other types of
information. And the exemption from federal enforcement would
remain intact in states that actively regulate the insurance
industry.
   A broad coalition of some 30 consumer and professional
groups, including the American Bar Association, supports some
type of legislation to amend the McCarran-Ferguson law. "I
can't imagine losing on the {House} floor during an election
year," said Robert Hunter, head of the National Insurance
Consumers Organization in Arlington, Va. "We're going to
frame this debate as `Who is for or against insurance
price-fixing.'"
   Earl Pomeroy, North Dakota insurance commissioner and
president of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, calls the bill "bad public policy." He said
supporters of the legislation haven't demonstrated how "it
will lower prices and improve service -- the two things
consumers most want."
   Mr. Pomeroy also said that, although the measure would
allow for federal enforcement in insurance by enabling the
Federal Trade Commission to investigate allegations, passage
of the bill "doesn't mean we'll have federal regulation
tomorrow."
   Some large insurers, such as Allstate Insurance Co., a
unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., and State Farm Mutual Insurance
Co., would be willing to live without the federal antitrust
exemption if states abolished laws that regulate rates, which
they said just adds another layer of regulation to what
already exists. "Give us what other competitive industries
have -- complete pricing freedom," said Robert Pike,
Allstate's general counsel.

One participant in this documentary calls it "our moon shot
of the early 1900s." The building of the Panama Canal was in
fact a triumph of American achievement. Where the French had
been defeated by the jungle and the mosquitoes, the Americans
prevailed and built the canal. In 1977, the Carter
administration agreed to treaties that will give the canal to
Panama in the year 2000. This somewhat deceptively titled
film, narrated by the always reassuring Edwin Newman,
provides riveting material on the digging of the canal, and
what it calls "the U.S. city-state" in Panama. But all too
soon, history is cast aside in favor of talkiness, mostly
talkiness of a familiar, if not absolutely mindnumbing, kind
about the failures of our Latin American policy.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, June 27, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "American

love. Even people without this duo's fundamental disabilities
would find it challenging to conduct an amorous relationship
entirely via transatlantic telephone.

with an admirable touch of spleen. Encore Tuesday, July 10,

   Wednesday, July 4, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E: The first
installment of a new 17-part documentary series, "The War
Years," to be continued on subsequent Wednesdays. The World
War II footage is extraordinary and mostly unfamiliar, edited
so as to concentrate in almost leisurely fashion on details.
The result is a harrowing, suspenseful close-up of the war,
and the preparation for it. The first chapter, dealing with
the Nazi staging of the invasion of Poland, and then, the
onslaught itself, provides a lingering last look at the
Warsaw that was. It is history as it should be told. It is,
above all, history that should not be missed.

   Robert McEwen, Goldcorp's president and chief executive
officer, said the company agreed to review its relationship
with CSA Management Ltd. and subsidiaries Dickenson Gold
Mines Ltd. and Wharf Resources Ltd. "with a view to
restructuring" Goldcorp.

through its holding of common shares. Goldcorp's Class A
shareholders, with limited voting powers, are entitled to
elect two of the eight Goldcorp directors.
   James McCartney, a Toronto lawyer, and Robert Simon,
senior vice president and treasurer of Brascan Ltd., have
launched a proxy battle against Goldcorp management to gain
seats on the board. Among other things, the two questioned
the investment management fees paid by Goldcorp to CSA.
Goldcorp's annual meeting is scheduled for Monday.
   Mr. McEwen said Goldcorp also will consider enlarging its
board to 10 members, to include an additional two directors
to be elected by holders of the Class A, subordinate-voting
shares. He said Messrs. McCartney and Simon would be
nominated to these additional board seats.
   Mr. McEwen said he expects a restructuring plan to be
presented for shareholder approval later this year.

   A unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group violated Delaware
disclosure laws in its 1985 acquisition of the minority
shares of Shell Oil Co., a Delaware judge ruled.
   Chancery Court Judge Maurice A. Hartnett III said minority
holders should have been told about the existence of
approximately $1 billion in Shell Oil gas and oil reserves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The inadequate disclosure was due to an error in
calculation, the judge acknowledged, but he said it still
breached disclosure requirements. He said the information was
important enough that it might have caused some holders to
seek an appraisal of their shares' value, instead of
tendering the stock to the Royal Dutch unit, Shell Petroleum
Inc.
   Judge Hartnett didn't rule on a remedy for the 20,000
former Shell Oil holders who brought the class action suit
seeking more money for their shares. That will be determined
after a separate hearing, the judge said.
   Lee Godfrey, an attorney with the Houston firm of Susman
Godfrey, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said he was
"confident" the judge would find the fair value was
"substantially in excess" of the $60 a share the minority
holders received from the Royal Dutch unit.
   In a separate action in Delaware, Susman Godfrey is
representing another group of Shell Oil holders who did seek
appraisal of their shares instead of tendering their stock.
In that case, an expert for the plaintiffs has argued that
the shares are worth between $89 and $109 each. An appraiser
for the Royal Dutch unit has placed the value at $55 a share.
   Royal Dutch, based in the Netherlands and London, in 1984
began trying to acquire the 30.6% stake of Shell Oil it
didn't already own. Its $58-a-share tender offer was
challenged in Delaware court. A subsequent settlement of the
suit in effect increased the price to $60 a share and Royal
Dutch went on to acquire all but 5.4% of Shell Oil's shares.
   Under Delaware law, a company that owns more than 90% of
another company's stock can take the remaining minority
shares at a set price. Minority holders can either accept the
price or seek an appraisal of their stock in an attempt to
get more money. The case decided by Judge Hartnett involved
minority holders who accepted Royal Dutch's $60 price and
then sued, claiming the disclosure materials they received
violated state law.
   In Houston, Shell Oil said it is "disappointed" with the
ruling. The company said Judge Hartnett based his decision on
an inadvertent error that left out about 8% of the discounted
future net cash flow from estimated oil and gas reserves.
Shell termed that information "soft" data based on "numerous
assumptions and estimates."
   In light of the "voluminous" information that was
furnished to shareholders, "we believe they could readily
have made an informed decision with respect to the 1985
merger proposal," Shell said.

   PAN AM IS SUED for breach of settlement by families of
Lockerbie crew.
   The survivors of the flight crew, killed when Pan Am
Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December
1988, claim that Pan Am World Airways violated an agreement
to pay them compensation benefits totaling $2.6 million.
Those benefits are owed under the crew's employment
contracts, according to the suit. The benefits aren't related
to damages that may be sought in other suits against the
airline and other Pan Am Corp. subsidiaries, said Read K.
McCaffrey, an attorney for the flight-crew's families.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York,
claims that the families agreed to a settlement proposal from
Pan Am on June 6, but that the airline added a requirement
that substantially changed the agreement a week later. Mr.
McCaffrey said the added language would have required the
families to agree not to sue the airline for any wrongdoing
related to the explosion. Other suits stemming from the
Lockerbie bombing have claimed that Pan Am's security
measures were inadequate.
   A spokesman for Pan Am declined to comment. Also named as
a defendant in the suit is Pan Am's insurer, U.S. Aviation
Underwriters Inc. Dominick A. Alfieri, a vice president of
U.S. Aviation, said he couldn't comment on pending
litigation.
   Mr. McCaffrey said the families want to preserve their
right to sue the airline in case pending investigations of
the bombing indicate that Pan Am was negligent in its
security efforts. He said the language added to the agreement
was "an outrageous and unreasonable demand."
   The compensation benefits ranged from $8,000 for one
flight attendant who had no dependent survivors to $500,000
each for the pilot and the flight engineer. The benefits are
based on wages and other factors in the contract, Mr.
McCaffrey said.
   The compensation benefits "have nothing to do with who or
what caused the plane to go down," Mr. McCaffrey said. "We
still would have been entitled to these amounts."

court.
   A former defense lawyer in Philadelphia who offered legal
assistance to an alleged member of the revolutionary May 19
Movement can be ordered to testify before a federal grand
jury, a federal appeals court has ruled.
   Linda Backiel, in private practice in Puerto Rico, has so
far refused to testify, asserting among other arguments an
attorney-client privilege. The principle is meant to protect
all confidences between clients and lawyers from disclosure.
   Cases such as this one are beginning to alarm defense
lawyers. Compelling lawyers to testify about what their
clients tell them could make clients reluctant to disclose
important information to their lawyer, defense attorneys
argue.
   In this case, Elizabeth Ann Duke was awaiting trial in
Philadelphia on weapons and explosives charges when she
disappeared in 1985. At the time, Ms. Backiel was doing legal
research for her defense team. Ms. Backiel never represented
Ms. Duke in court but was allegedly the last person to see a
note from her describing her motives in the case and her
intention to flee. The note has since disappeared.
   Subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury
investigating the disappearance, Ms. Backiel asserted the
attorney-client privilege and refused to discuss the note or
anything else related to the case. Following a hearing last
March before U.S. District Judge Charles R. Weiner, in
Philadelphia, she was held in contempt.
   Last week, the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered
a new hearing, but only because Judge Weiner closed parts of
the initial hearing to the public.
   The appeals judges rejected arguments that compelling
disclosure would have a chilling effect on Ms. Backiel's
attorney-client relationship with other controversial
clients, and that federal prosecutors had singled her out for
representing radicals.
   Another hearing, this one in open court, is expected
within 10 days, said a defense attorney for Ms. Backiel, who
declined further comment.
   If she continues to refuse to testify, Ms. Backiel faces
as much as 18 months in jail.

   LEGAL RESIDENCY standards expanded by judge.
   A federal district judge in Rockford, Ill., ordered the
Agriculture Department to include sod as a perishable
commodity under agency regulations that grant certain alien
farm workers easier access to legal resident status.
   The ruling could make it easier for up to 10,000 illegal
foreign agricultural workers to establish permanent U.S.
residency, according to the lawyers for farm workers and
sod-farm owners.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley J. Roszkowski said the
agency's exclusion of sod in their Special Agricultural
Workers regulations, or SAW, was "arbitrary and capricious."
   The regulations, enacted in the wake of the Immigration
Reform Control Act of 1986, offer legal resident status to
certain illegal aliens, including those who can prove they
had been performing "seasonal agricultural services" in the
U.S. for 90 days in the one-year period ending May, 1986.
   SAW includes as seasonal agricultural services the growing
of fruits, vegetables, and "other perishable commodities,"
including Christmas trees. A group of sod-farm owners and
workers filed a suit against officials at the U.S.
departments of Agriculture, Justice, and Immigration, arguing
that their crops have critical and unpredictable labor
demands, and therefore meet the standards for inclusion under
SAW.
   A spokesman for the Justice department said the agency is
reviewing the decision and "considering our options."

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Film:
   Gizmo et al. in the Big Apple

   Donald Trump should go see "Gremlins 2, The New Batch."
This amusing sequel is built around an avaricious New York
landlord, conglomerateur and best-selling author named Daniel
Clamp who likes to name his holdings after himself. Like his
real life counterpart, Clamp faces the destruction of his
empire by outside forces. But Clamp triumphs over adversity,
and Mr. Trump should be cheered by his uncanny ability to
turn potential disaster into a marketing triumph.
   "Gremlins 2," which is infinitely more entertaining than
the 1984 original, has moved its mixture of comedy and horror
to New York City from Kingston Falls. With the change of
venue, the film makers dropped the phony sentimental sheen
that made "Gremlins" seem so heartlessly calculated. Now
they've exposed and polished the nasty edge to their gleeful
humor, which couldn't be more appropriate to the setting, the
electronically controlled wasteland of Clamp Centre.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In this cold gray monster of a building, everything runs
by automation: the revolving doors, the elevators, the
lights. Water fountains spurt without touch, computerized
voices announce themselves in the most inappropriate settings
("Welcome to the men's room," says one, for example. "Hey
pal. I hope you washed your hands"). Even the humans who run
the place are automated. When Clamp's chief operations man
comes upon gremlins ripping and tearing things apart, he
mutters: "This is a complete failure of management."
   Anyone who lives or works amid this kind of technological
"advancement" can't help but feel warmly toward the gruesome
gremlins who wreak havoc on the Clamp Centre. Director Joe
Dante and his special-effects technicians have dreamed up the
most ingenious ways for these mean-spirited little monsters
to search and destroy.
   As sequels must, this one spends some time explaining the
original movie to the audience. But the film makers dispatch
the boilerplate handily. For those who have managed to forget
the ubiquitous marketing campaign that accompanied "Gremlins"
the first time: The creatures must be kept away from sunlight
(or they'll be killed); from water (or they'll mulitiply);
from food after midnight (or they'll be transmogrified into
something awful).
   Once again the gremlins start out cute, like the little
guy named Gizmo. Gizmo finds himself about to become an
experimental subject in the genetics lab that operates in the
Clamp Centre. There he meets up with his old friends Billy
and Kate (Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates), the young couple
from Kingston Falls who have grown up and relocated to New
York. Urban but not yet urbane, they have remained
companionably dull and still are able to perform their
function -- to chase and be chased by gremlins when required.
   The rest of the cast has much more pep, especially
Haviland Morris as Marla Bloodstone. Done up like a '50s
comedy vision of a career gal (tortoise-shell glasses and
bright red lips and nails), Ms. Morris has a nice comic
nasality. And John Glover's Clamp looks like a caricaturist's
Donald Trump. But then so does Donald Trump.
   The story is the usual: Creepy things take over a house
and what are the humans to do? But what makes this picture
enjoyable are the endlessly imaginative ways the film makers
have deployed the gremlins. Once again Mr. Dante and his crew
do a gremlinization of pop culture. There's a gremlin doing
Olivier in "Marathon Man"; another gremlin does Frank Sinatra
singing "New York, New York" with a massive chorus of gremlin
backup singers. I won't give away the most ingenious moment
of gremlinatrics: Just remember, don't leave the theater too
soon.
   ---
   "Gremlins 2," however, appears to be the exception that
proves the rule: Sequels aren't as much fun.
   That's certainly the case with the unexceptional "Another
48 Hours." Director Walter Hill's dramatically choreographed
episodes of violence and mayhem have become tedious, like a
child who knows how to do triple somersaults and nothing
else, and insists on repeating the trick over and over again.
It's rather astonishing to watch at first, then monotonous,
then irritating.
   The unlikely pairing of criminal and cop wasn't really
what made the first movie so entertaining. It was the early
appearance of young Eddie Murphy, startling everyone with his
fast and funny mouth. Mr. Murphy isn't really the problem
here, except to the extent that he is now so powerful he
could easily be somewhere else. He and Nick Nolte, the
reluctant partner, don't walk through their parts. They
couldn't even if they wanted to: The parts are so soft the
actors can't help but sink.
   When people aren't getting blown apart, or glass isn't
shattering, the picture is devoted to the bringing-up-to-date
process. This leaves the viewer much time to ponder the
current cinema: Why must the bad guys always be drug dealers?
Why are they always hip black guys or unwashed motorcycle
gangsters? Why do they always have such bad skin? Will there
be "Yet Another 48 Hours?"
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Unlikely pairings have always been a favorite
subject for Hollywood film makers. One of the sweetest and
funniest was the O'Neal match, when a young Ryan and a very
young Tatum played a con man and kid in the delightful "Paper
Moon," back in 1973. No drug dealers, no shattered glass.

   Net Rises for Japan's `Big Four' Brokers

   TOKYO -- Japan's "Big Four" securities houses managed to
post increases in group pretax profits for the fiscal year
ended March 31, despite the sharp plunge in Japanese stock
and bond prices from January through March.
   Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko
Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities Co. said strong
results during the first nine months of the fiscal year
helped them emerge from the final quarter's plunge ahead of
the previous fiscal year's results.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, the continued fallout from the confusion in
Japanese markets during the January-March quarter has led the
four to issue pessimistic predictions for the current fiscal
year.
   The four companies changed their fiscal year from one
beginning Oct. 1 to one beginning April 1, starting with
fiscal 1989.
   As a result, fiscal 1988 covers only a six-month period.
The companies doubled fiscal 1988 figures in order to make
comparisons with fiscal 1989's full-year figures.
   Underwriting and distribution commissions for the four
companies rose strongly, reflecting the surge in equity
finance for the year, overcoming relatively weaker earnings
from brokerage commissions on stock and bond transactions and
net gains on trading.
   Because of the explosion in equity finance during fiscal
1989, and the current suspension of equity finance during the
first months of fiscal 1990 on account of the stock market's
fragile condition, the Big Four predicted income from
underwriting would fall drastically this year.
   In addition, a drop in commissions on transactions from
June will cut into another source of the Big Four's income.
   Nomura reported fiscal-year pretax profits edged up 0.1%
to 538.01 billion yen ($3.5 billion). Earnings rose 9% to
261.64 billion yen.
   Daiwa said group pretax profit edged up 0.9% to 339.2
billion yen during fiscal 1989. Profit rose 11% to 164
billion yen.
   Nikko said group pretax earnings for fiscal 1989 edged up
0.1% to 274.67 billion yen. Profit climbed 10% to 130.04
billion yen.
   Yamaichi reported pretax profit rose 8.3% to 247.61
billion yen during fiscal 1989. Earnings rose 8.9% to 108.8
billion yen.

   NEW YORK -- Stock and bond prices rose in the morning but
fell in the afternoon on yet another shred of news that
suggests the Federal Reserve isn't about to ease its grip on
interest rates.
   While stocks managed to eke out a small gain because of a
spurt of program buying that erased a 10-point deficit within
minutes of the final bell, bonds finished lower. The same
news that undercut those markets was a factor in pushing the
dollar slightly higher against other major currencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.74 points
higher at 2895.30 in a third consecutive day of lethargic
trading. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell nearly a
half point, or $5 for each $1,000 of face amount, also in
quiet trading.
   Bonds headed lower after the noon release of the "Beige
Book" -- a bimonthly compilation of regional Federal Reserve
Bank economic reports that members of the Federal Open Market
Committee will study before their next meeting, July 2 and 3.
   The book contained no major surprises, but it is viewed as
an indicator of the Fed governors' thinking. Investors
focused on two elements in it that might reinforce the Fed's
current reluctance to ease interest rates.
   First, the report noted strong growth in capital-goods
industries. Second, the opening summary suggests the rate of
inflation isn't declining, though the regional reports that
follow didn't offer much evidence to back up that conclusion,
said Raymond W. Stone, managing director at Stone &amp; McCarthy
Research Associates, Princeton, N.J.
   Also hurting bond prices was a large supply of new
corporate and municipal bond issues. Dealers taking these
issues into their inventories as they begin searching for
buyers tend to sell government bonds to offset the carrying
cost.
   Stock investors followed bond prices until the late spate
of buying. "Institutional participation remains light," said
Thomas R. Walsh, head of equity trading at Nikko Securities
International.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices edged higher on volume of 137.4 million
shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues
outnumbered advancers, 777 to 668.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.51%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6785 marks and 153.93 yen, compared with
1.6738 marks and 153.55 yen Tuesday.

as a buyer for Smart, a year-old men's magazine owned by New
American Magazines Co.

   The Straight Arrow publication will join a horde of new
U.S. men's magazines that focus on issues beyond typical male
magazine topics. News Corp.'s Murdoch Magazines plans to
launch Men's Life this fall. Christopher Kimball, the founder
of Cook's magazine, is planning Men, aimed at the
25-to-40-year-old set. And Conde Nast Publications Inc. has
revamped Details as a style magazine for young men.
   John Rasmus, 36-years-old, who for the past six years has
been the editor of Outside, a Chicago-based monthly, will be
the editor of Straight Arrow's new publication. Under Mr.
Rasmus, Outside magazine won two National Magazine Awards.

   Westpac Joins Primary-Dealer Dropouts

   Another financial institution fell from the ranks of the
exclusive but brutally competitive U.S. securities dealers
that do business directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.
   Australia's Westpac Banking Corp. said it was closing its
Westpac Pollock Government Securities Inc. subsidiary
immediately. The primary dealer had losses of about $29
million in the first half of its year that began Oct. 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Once one of the most coveted franchises in international
finance, the group of firms that deal with the New York Fed
when it buys and sells U.S. government securities as part of
its activities to influence U.S. monetary policy -- known as
"primary dealers" -- have had a tough time making money over
the past two years.
   The U.S. government-bond business "has become very
difficult," said John R. Burrus, president and chief
executive officer of CRT Government Securities Ltd., another
primary dealer. "Trading volume is down, profit margins are
down, too, and volatility is way down from prior years."
   Westpac is Australia's biggest bank with about 118 billion
Australian dollars (US$92.5 billion) in assets, of which
roughly 10% is in the U.S. The bank said most of the closed
unit's approximately 160 employees have been dismissed.
Westpac paid $120 million for Wm. E. Pollock Government
Securities Inc., an independent securities firm, in late
1986.
   The securities subsidiary posted a deficit of $3.9 million
in fiscal 1989, ended Sept. 30, mostly because of losses
associated with a failed attempt to start up a
mortgage-backed securities operation. But Anthony J. Walton,
executive vice president and general manager at Westpac in
New York, said that the government-bond dealing operations
had remained profitable until this year.
   People in the bond market said that Westpac tried selling
the operations to France's Cie. Financiere de Paribas and a
big Japanese bank, but was unsuccessful. Paribas didn't
return a phone call for confirmation.
   Some other firms are rumored to be either on the block or
considering closing down their operations, several traders
said.
   Despite the closing, Mr. Walton said: "Westpac's other
operations in the U.S. are very healthy and very profitable."
He said the bank maintained relationships with about 250
major U.S. corporations.
   "You have to be very, very clear on focus, and we felt
that strategically the primary dealership no longer fitted as
it did in 1986," said Mr. Walton, noting the intense
competition in global securities markets. "It's a very tough
decision to give up something that so many people prize such
as this; but at the end of the day, it's the shareholder that
counts."
   Last year, two British banks -- National Westminster Bank
PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC -- abandoned the business, along with
L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. Two dealerships were also eliminated
when Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. last year acquired the
brokerage business of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. filed for protection under
the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Westpac's dropout lowers to 43 the number of primary
dealers, from a peak of 46 at the end of 1988. Sixteen of the
firms are controlled by foreign institutions: eight Japanese,
three British, two Swiss and one each from Canada and Hong
Kong. The Fed also lists First Boston Corp. as a foreign
institution, because over 50% of it is owned by foreigners,
but doesn't assign it a specific national designation.
However, some people regard it as a Swiss institution,
because it is 44.5% owned by CS Holding, which also owns
Credit Suisse, a big bank.
   Still, several firms, mostly foreign, have eagerly sought
to be designated as primary dealers. A major reason is that
numerous U.S. pension funds, insurance companies and other
large institutional investors will do business only with
primary dealers. Moreover, winning admission is widely
considered a mark of prestige.
   A subsidiary of Swiss Bank Corp. became a primary dealer
in March. Last December, units of Union Bank of Switzerland
and Britain's Barclays Bank PLC joined the elite club. And
other foreign institutions, including West Germany's Deutsche
Bank AG, are waiting in the wings.

   Stocks Rise Slightly but Many Traders
   Await News of Treasury's Note Sale

   Over-the-counter stocks managed to close slightly higher,
but many traders awaited news of next week's sale of two-year
and four-year Treasury notes.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.27 to 460.80, a 0.06%
gain, on 148.1 million shares, up from 143 million shares
Tuesday. Advancing stocks barely outpaced declining shares,
967 to 931.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After opening higher, the OTC market fell prey to
profit-taking; the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.87 in
intraday trading before recovering. "There was some
apprehension about the Treasury's plans" for the notes sale,
said Peter Coolidge, senior OTC trader at Kidder Peabody. He
added the late-day recovery reflected optimism that the
Treasury sales wouldn't push interest rates up.
   But Mr. Coolidge said that uncertainty about economic data
due for release later this week could encourage other
investors to the sidelines. "To get a sustained rally in this
choppy market is very difficult," he said, adding that
investors remain uncertain about whether the market has
peaked.
   Two stocks gave up their gains from Tuesday. MCI
Communications eased 7/8 to 41 5/8 on more than 1.9 million
shares, pressuring the Nasdaq Utility Index down 3.72 to
655.14. Shares of the Washington, D.C., long-distance carrier
closed up 5/8 Tuesday amid expectations of a positive
announcement yesterday, traders said. The company unveiled a
new long-distance service aimed at small- to mid-sized
companies.
   Also active was Newport Pharmaceuticals, which fell 5/8 to
3 on 780,200 shares. Tuesday, the stock gained 13/16 after
reports that Scandinavian tests of its controversial drug,
isoprinosine, indicated the drug may delay the onset of AIDS
in people infected with the HIV virus. However, Food and Drug
Administration officials cautioned that the studies ran
counter to other tests of the drug and said the results must
be viewed cautiously.
   Nike leaped 2 5/8 to 77 5/8 after the Beaverton, Ore.,
athletic footwear maker declared a 2-for-1 stock split late
Tuesday. The company also said its board will ask
shareholders at the Sept. 17 annual meeting to approve a
threefold increase in the authorized shares of both the Class
A and Class B common stock. Nike also said it plans to apply
for listing of its Class B common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange after completion of the stock split.
   Marquest Medical Products jumped 1 1/2 to 9 after the
Englewood, Colo., maker of disposable medical products
reported operating profit for the fourth quarter ended March
31 of $994,000, up from $22,000 a year earlier.
   Pacific Nuclear Systems advanced 1/2 to 5 7/8 after the
Federal Way, Wash., provider of nuclear waste disposal
services said a unit of the company and a West German company
were awarded a contract to clean two steam generators for
Korea Electric Power Corp.
   Werner Enterprises added 3/4 to 18 1/2. Tuesday, the
Omaha, Neb., motor carrier declared a regular
three-cent-a-share dividend payable July 23.
   Rumors fueled a 7 3/8-point surge in the American
depositary receipts of LM Ericsson Telephone, according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Traders cited rumors
the Swedish communications equipment company will win a large
contract to supply cellular telephone equipment for the
metropolitan New York City area. However, a spokeswoman told
Professional Investor Report that the company had no
announcements, adding that she doesn't see anything
"absolutely tremendous in the foreseeable future." The ADRs
closed at a high of 224 1/8.
   Rebounding from a 1/4 drop Tuesday,
   CoreStates Financial rose 1/2 to 41 as analysts disagreed
about the effect of the Philadelphia bank's recent
acquisition of First Pennsylvania Corp., according to
Professional Investor Report. Yesterday, Merrill Lynch
analyst Livia Asher said she thinks cost savings from the
acquisition could be better than expected and could help
produce strong results in the second half.
   However, Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Richard Lawrence
on Tuesday lowered his opinion on the stock to a "sell" from
a "buy." The analyst cited concerns about the potential for
further real estate loan deterioration, especially from the
First Pennsylvania purchase, Professional Investor Report
said.
   Repligen traded more than 25 times average volume. The
Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology and health-care concern
issued two million common shares priced at $15.50 each.
Repligen fell 3/4 to 15 on 837,000 shares.
   Two financial issues tumbled as the weak Northeastern real
estate market continued to plague some banks and thrifts in
that region.
   Eastland Financial slid 5/8 to 3 after the Woonsocket,
R.I., thrift and banking holding company said that additions
to its loan-loss reserves will result in a pretax charge of
$19 million and a loss for the second quarter. The company's
management said it will recommend suspending its
10-cent-a-share dividend in the second quarter until
"appropriate levels of profitability" are restored. Eastland
Financial had net income of 22 cents a share in the second
quarter a year earlier.
   Affiliated Banc eased 1/8 to 2 1/4 after the Holyoke,
Mass., thrift said it will suspend its eight-cent-a-share
quarterly dividend indefinitely and expects to report a loss
of $3.5 million for the second quarter ending in June.
   Showbiz Pizza Time tumbled 3 1/2 to 22 1/4 after officials
of the Irving, Texas, family restaurant concern told analysts
the company expects same-store sales to be flat for the
second quarter, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Frank
told Professional Investor Report the company now expects to
earn about 33 cents a share, up from 21 cents a share a year
earlier, which included an eight-cent tax credit. Eppler,
Guerin &amp; Turner analyst Dennis Telzrow slashed his quarterly
earnings estimate for Showbiz Pizza Time to 32 cents a share
from 42 cents a share after the presentation, Professional
Investor Report said.
   Cross &amp; Trecker fell 1/4 to 8 3/4. Tuesday, the Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., machine-tool maker said it sold its Alliance
Automation unit in Rochester, N.Y., to closely held Ambac
International Ltd. of Dallas. Terms weren't disclosed. The
stock fell 1/4 Tuesday.

   Sunny Forecast for '90s

   As my Midwestern granny always said: First comes the rain,
then comes the sun. First we had Ravi Batra's "Great
Depression of the 1990's" and now we have Charles R. Morris's
"The Coming Global Boom: How to Benefit Now from Tomorrow's
Dynamic World Economy" (Bantam, 267 pages, $19.95).
   Just as Mr. Batra spread darkness and gloom, so does Mr.
Morris chase away the clouds. With a chirpy optimism that
would make Doris Day cringe, Mr. Morris looks into the future
and finds it better than good, he finds it stupendous. The
1990s, he gushes, will be a decade of unparalleled economic
growth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unfortunately, Mr. Morris is a better critic than a seer.
He comes out on the contrarian side of many current issues,
but is maddeningly unconvincing when it comes to predicting
the future.
   Looking at the three headaches of the times -- the budget
deficit, the trade deficit and industrial policy -- Mr.
Morris finds the conventional wisdom wrong.
   To begin, the twin deficits are not really deficits. In
both cases, says Mr. Morris, the deficits are creatures of
accounting problems. The federal budget deficit failed to
deck the economy during the 1980s because it wasn't much of a
deficit in the first place; indeed, when state and local
surpluses are taken into account, government deficits were
under control. Also, because we owe the debt to ourselves,
the numbers just represent a transfer of wealth from some
citizens to others and therefore is unremarkable.
   Ditto for the trade deficit. When assets and liabilities
are properly measured, the U.S. is not the largest net debtor
nation; in fact, the U.S. may have been a creditor nation
throughout most of the 1980s. Moreover, says Mr. Morris, it's
okay for foreign investors to own assets here because it
means that foreigners have a stake in our future and, anyway,
the money they earn mostly stays here.
   As for the debate over whether the U.S. should have some
form of industrial policy to direct investment and protect
domestic industry, Mr. Morris is in the don't-be-silly camp.
He points out that industrial policies don't work -- witness
the many European failures and the big boo-boos made by
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).
(For example, Britain subsidized its auto companies to death
and MITI was only lukewarm on a Japanese car industry.)
   So far, so good. But then comes the embarrassing part in
which Mr. Morris describes the forces that will create a
global boom. Consider:
   First, there will be a trend toward less government
borrowing that will result in lower interest rates. (Just why
governments suddenly will stop spending more than they have,
he doesn't say.)
   All things are possible, of course, but Mr. Morris goes on
to predict that the 1990s will bring a shortage of government
bonds. The folks at Resolution Trust Corp. will be pleased to
hear that the tremendous number of bonds they must float over
the next decade to fund the thrift bailout will find an eager
market suffering under conditions of scarcity. They might
also be puzzled, quite understandably, since Mr. Morris
doesn't say how this and escalating off-budget borrowing
activities fit into his scenario.
   Second, there will be a bust in the real estate market
that will free up capital for industrial investment. This
force is a consequence of the disappearance of the causes of
the real estate boom in the 1970s. Those causes, according to
Mr. Morris, were baby boomers looking for shelter and old
folks holding on to their homes.
   Okay, but the explosion of demand for real estate also was
due to wicked inflation, which made hard assets a smart thing
to hold, and tax laws that promote investment in residential
housing. Tax laws certainly are crucial in discussing and
forecasting the real estate market, but Mr. Morris doesn't
mention them.
   Third, there will be an organizational and technological
transformation of global industries that will mean increases
in manufacturing productivity and a rise in global output.
Sure, but using a bunch of business baloney that will make
Tom Peters drool with envy, Mr. Morris does more rhapsodizing
about corporate cleverness than explaining the coming change.
   He argues that the notion of comparative advantage is
old-fashioned; in the new world of global industries,
comparative advantage will belong to companies, not
countries. Maybe, but even global industries might want to
locate in countries with good human capital, a sophisticated
infrastructure, an accommodating body of laws and, of course,
reasonable tax laws. But, again, in his rush to spread the
sunshine, Mr. Morris ignores these critical factors.
   After making these and other peculiar leaps of faith and
hopeful claims, Mr. Morris offers some disappointingly flat
investment advice. If he really believes interest rates and
inflation are coming down, then locking in a lot of long-term
Treasuries would be the way to go. But, no. Mr. Morris
classifies those as speculative and recommends, instead, that
investors diversify their portfolio of stocks and invest for
the long term. Money magazine couldn't have done better.
   It's not that Mr. Morris should have written a different
book; this one would have been just fine if he hadn't made so
many weird omissions or substituted singsong cheerfulness for
argument. It's enough to make one yearn for a thundershower.

   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s junk bonds soared as much as 6%
yesterday as the company confirmed it is considering ways to
retire "a significant amount" of its most troublesome bonds.
   As reported in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, RJR has
begun a vast refinancing effort that centers on retiring at
least $4 billion of high-yield "junk" bonds. The program is
being negotiated by RJR's main shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. It involves bonds that are due to have their
interest rates reset by next April; difficulties with that
reset could hurt the food and tobacco company's financial
health.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The biggest price run-up yesterday came in RJR's
convertible reset bonds of 2009, which jumped $62.50 for each
$1,200 face amount, to close at $971.25 each. Those bonds now
are regarded as likely candidates to be exchanged for cash or
a new convertible preferred stock. RJR's reset bonds of 2007,
meanwhile, climbed $42.50 for each $1,000 face amount, to
$806.25. As word of RJR's refinancing plans has gradually
emerged the past two weeks, both series of bonds have risen
nearly 15% in price.
   Junk-bond specialists were pleased about RJR's plans, but
wary of sounding too enthusiastic until it's clear that all
the necessary financing is in place. "It's pretty good news,"
said Carolyn Katz, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., "but
we have to see the precise terms first."
   RJR said it expects to finish its deliberations and start
its refinancing program by the end of July. Bankers expect
RJR to raise $2.25 billion in fresh bank loans and as much as
$1.7 billion from an equity infusion by limited partnerships
that KKR controls. In addition, RJR may issue $1.5 billion of
convertible preferred stock in exchange for some of the reset
bonds outstanding.
   If the RJR refinancing is carried out as currently
planned, it will reduce the company's debt-to-equity ratio
from a daredevil 28:1 to a more conservative, though still
high 5:1, according to sources familiar with the plan.
Although that would reduce the potential profits that the
leveraged buy-out firm of KKR can earn on the buy-out, it
would put RJR on a sounder financial footing.
   Beyond its three-paragraph news release, RJR declined to
comment on its refinancing. "We think that further
elaboration at this point would complicate things," a
spokesman said.
   Even so, some money managers quickly issued bullish
assessments of the likely refinancing package. "It's pretty
attractive," said one West Coast arbitrager, who had bought
RJR junk bonds at prices as low as 60 cents on the dollar.
"I'm not a pig," he added. "If they can get me out at 85
cents on the dollar, I'm a happy departee."
   Analysts cautioned that many junk-bond holders' selling
price appears to be 7% to 10% above whatever the current
market price is. That suggests that as the junk bonds
appreciate, RJR may have a hard time buying them back at much
less than face value.
   Some investors said the reported terms of the preferred --
a 10% dividend and conversion into RJR equity at about a 50%
premium to the indicated current market price -- seem
appealing enough. Alan Snyder, president of San
Francisco-based Snyder Capital Management, argued that the
preferred issue will compare favorably with a similar issue
of convertible preferred stock issued by Time Warner Inc.
   But a more bearish view was expressed by traders at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., who suggested that RJR would have to
lower the conversion premium to make the preferred trade at
face value. Terms are likely to be thrashed around for the
next month or more.
   Analysts say it's clear that KKR is choosing a more
cautious, safer course. "People believe this deal is KKR's
franchise," said Edward Mally, an analyst at Salomon Brothers
Inc. "They want to believe that at the end of the day, they
have to make it work. This isn't a situation where they can
afford to hurt bondholders."
   Executives close to RJR say an improving outlook at the
company may be encouraging KKR to invest more equity in its
buy-out. Although RJR posts net losses because of its big
interest bill, operating profit in the first quarter of this
year surged 50% from a year earlier. Its operating profit
from tobacco jumped 40% in the first quarter, robust growth
for any industry, let alone one in which domestic demand is
shrinking more than 3% a year. RJR's operating profit from
food grew 18% in the first period.
   "They're getting a hell of a lot more cash flow than they
ever expected," said a senior executive close to RJR.
   RJR also may be starting to look for growth by
acquisitions, after a flurry of divestitures the past 16
months that helped reduce debt. Since the buy-out, many
food-industry analysts have expected RJR to shed its
shredded-wheat breakfast cereal division because the unit
holds just a small slice of its market. But RJR executives
have apparently decided to hold the business for now, said an
executive close to Nabisco, and are even considering an
acquisition to increase market share.

   Plans to Retire

   Reorganization Is Slated

   NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp. Chairman Willard C.
Butcher said he will retire Oct. 31, two months earlier than
expected, to clear the way for a major reorganization of the
nation's second-largest banking concern.
   Mr. Butcher said Thomas G. Labrecque, president, will
succeed him as chairman and chief executive officer, as
expected. Arthur F. Ryan, currently the vice chairman in
charge of Chase's highly successful consumer bank, will
succeed Mr. Labrecque.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Tom Labrecque and I have been working on some of the
responses to the challenges facing the banking business and
we think those responses require some organizational
changes," Mr. Butcher said in an interview. "There will be
some changes in the next level of the corporation and we
believe we couldn't implement those changes until the
succession issue was resolved." He said his long-stated plan
had been to retire on Dec. 31, but that the decision was
advanced in order to give Mr. Labrecque a chance to put the
new organizational structure into place before the end of the
year.
   Details of the reorganization will be released next week,
but it is understood to include cutbacks in the bank's
corporate finance department and top personnel changes in
other areas of the company.
   Mr. Butcher said that among the challenges facing Chase,
as well as other banks, is the corporate financing business,
where competition for the lower volume of business is vicious
and profit margins are under pressure.
   "Obviously, we're going to have to skinny down there," he
said. "We also face challenges in how we configure Europe,
we've got to grapple with the real estate challenge, and we
have to continue to grow certain important businesses like
consumer banking that has been so good to us."
   Mr. Labrecque said he expects the reorganization to be
fully in place by the end of the year. He wouldn't comment on
how many employees will lose their jobs as a result of the
reorganization, but he said the negative financial effects
would be outweighed by the postive effects and that most
write-offs would be taken this year.
   Chase isn't alone in its cutbacks. Earlier this week,
Bankers Trust New York Corp. announced that it was slicing 75
people from its corporate finance department.
   Manufacturers Hanover Corp. executives say that they have
seen memos targeting 25% reductions in personnel for some
departments, and Bank of Boston Corp. recently eliminated its
highly leveraged transaction unit.
   In addition, for the first quarter Chase posted
disappointing earnings and a big rise in non-performing
loans. Chase reported earnings of $44 million, or 20 cents a
share, compared with $132 million, or $1.27 a share a year
earlier. Non-accrual loans rose to $4.1 billion in the first
quarter from $3.9 billion at the end of last year.
   Mr. Butcher, 63 years old, will become chairman of the
executive committee of the board of directors on Oct. 31 for
a one-year term. He has served as chairman of Chase since
1980 when he succeeded David Rockefeller. Mr. Labrecque, 51,
was named vice chairman of the board and chief operating
officer in June 1980 and was subsequently elected president
in April 1981. Mr. Ryan, 47, was named vice chairman for
individual banking in November 1984.

   NEW YORK -- In his five years as chairman of Citicorp,
John S. Reed has used phrases like "consistent" and
"predictable" to describe his earnings objectives for the
nation's largest banking company.
   "My goal is to be boring," he once told securities
analysts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But "disappointing" more accurately describes Citicorp's
performance under Mr. Reed, the wunderkind who built the
Citibank consumer business. In the past decade, Citicorp has
achieved its earnings goal only once, in 1988.
   Now, investors, who once patiently conceded that Mr.
Reed's vision of a global financial-services company couldn't
be realized overnight, are increasingly questioning whether
he will achieve his goals -- 18% return on equity and 15% to
20% annual growth in earnings per share -- anytime soon.
Citicorp's first-quarter results strongly suggest it won't
happen this year. Says Mr. Reed: "That's a good bet."
   Typical of restive Citicorp shareholders is Kevin McCarey,
a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments. Saying that at a
meeting with Citicorp officials a month ago some investors
were "berating them," Mr. McCarey adds: "Everyone, including
us, is getting impatient because their consumer business is
going so well and more of the positive effect should be
reflected in the stock price."
   The 51-year-old Mr. Reed, the company's largest individual
shareholder, understands their frustrations: "You could say
our stock stinks, which is true." Yesterday, it closed at
$22.50, down 37 1/2 cents a share on the day and well below
its book value of $25.36 a share.
   Much of the disappointment with earnings in recent years
is attributable to soured Third World loans. But as that
problem receded somewhat, investors expected Citicorp's
tremendous consumer business to propel earnings to new
heights. However, those hopes have been dashed by a slump in
commercial real estate and corporate takeovers and
restructurings. Now, borrowers such as Campeau Corp., Ames
Department Stores and Donald Trump are replacing Brazil and
Argentina as the main problems dragging down Citicorp's
earnings and stock price. (The bank's Trump debt, largely
secured by the developer's properties, exceeds $200 million.)
   "While John Reed has done a lot of the right things,
there's good reason to get upset with Citicorp," says Nancy
Young, an analyst for the College Retirement Equities Fund, a
large stockholder. "We see all these goodies {in its consumer
business} and wonder why aren't we reaping more of the
benefits. In their zeal to invest in the future, they forget
about today. I don't have any problem with their investments
in the information business and other areas, but there has to
be some kind of balance."
   As troubled loans rise, Citicorp's reserve and capital
levels are looking skimpy. In both areas, Citicorp comes in
at or near the bottom among big U.S. banks: Its reserves are
only 56% of nonperforming loans, while many big competitors'
reserves are at about 70% or more, and its common-stock
equity is below that of almost all its rivals. By some
estimates, Citicorp needs $2 billion in additional capital
and reserves.
   Citicorp is "leaving a thin margin for error," says
Kenneth Pinkes of Moody's Investors Service.
   The low levels of capital and reserves recently led the
major debt-rating agencies to downgrade most ratings on
Citicorp's debt. The result: Citicorp will pay a slightly
higher price when borrowing money in the commercial-paper
market. Next to consumer deposits, commercial paper --
short-term IOUs -- has been Citicorp's cheapest source of
funds.
   The credit downgrading and weak stock price may, in turn,
curtail Citicorp's expansion just as it is prowling for
acquisitions in Europe and in California, which is opening
itself up to full-blown interstate banking in 1991.
   Indeed, Citicorp may be reconciled to sitting on the
sidelines. It recently agreed to purchase tiny DeAnza Bank,
of San Jose, Calif. California bankers interpret the $35
million acquisition as a signal that Citicorp may forgo
seeking to buy First Interstate Bancorp., a long-rumored
target, or another major institution there in favor of using
DeAnza to grow a branch at a time. Citicorp itself says it is
simply keeping its options open. (Since 1986, it has owned a
savings and loan association, recently renamed Citibank FSB,
in the San Francisco Bay area.)
   Citicorp dismisses criticism from Moody's and Standard &amp;
Poor's that it needs proportionately higher reserves. The
company argues that its far-flung, diverse portfolio makes it
unique among U.S. banks. Thomas E. Jones, Citicorp's
executive vice president for financial controls, audit and
taxes, says that in its worst years write-offs of bad loans
never exceeded 20% of nonperforming loans.
   Moreover, he says, one-third of the amounts written off
are eventually recovered. During the 1970s, Citicorp says,
the bank ultimately recouped half of what it wrote off on
real-estate loans through sales of foreclosed properties and
other means.
   But bankers and analysts see in the downgrading of the
nation's only truly global bank symbolic implications far
outweighing the pennies per share that it will cost
shareholders. "At the margin, capital markets are being shut
down to the nation's largest bank," says Charles Peabody, a
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst.
   Rather than knuckle under to calls for greater reserves
and more emphasis on short-term profits, Mr. Reed takes a
damn-the-torpedoes attitude. He refuses to cut bait on
several poor acquisitions that he made, such as its Arizona
bank, two S&amp;Ls and the Quotron subsidiary. He insists that
reserves are adequate and that capital will be replenished
through asset sales and retained earnings. New shares will be
issued only for a major acquisition, he adds.
   Mr. Reed, who relishes his reputation as a maverick,
always has had a penchant for risk-taking. As a junior
executive at Citicorp, he undertook what many regarded as a
no-win task: streamlining its back office and data
processing. Later, while building the consumer business, Mr.
Reed came close to being fired for his nonchalant attitude
toward years of mounting losses, former Citicorp officials
say. In his most celebrated move since becoming chairman, he
threw down the gauntlet to deadbeat borrowers such as Brazil:
His surprise $3 billion addition to reserves in 1987 implied
a willingness to halt any further lending to such countries.
   In April, Mr. Reed's bravado surfaced again. Citicorp
thumbed its nose at critics by announcing a 9.9% increase in
the dividend at the same time its write-offs of bad loans
soared 79% and first-quarter earnings plunged 56%.
   Yet, Mr. Reed clearly feels the pressure to improve
performance. The clearest sign was his decision in January to
name Richard S. Braddock to the long-vacant presidency. Mr.
Braddock, who had headed the consumer business, is a much
more hands-on manager than Mr. Reed, who prefers dealing with
strategic issues rather than nuts-and-bolts administration.
Now, Mr. Braddock is reviewing individual businesses'
progress on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis, enabling
the bank to respond more quickly to developing problems.
   To be sure, Mr. Reed has delivered on many of his
promises. For the first time this year, Citicorp's consumer
business will earn more than $1 billion, more than a fivefold
increase since he became chairman. The consumer bank's
earnings are growing by at least $100 million a year, and
Citicorp continues to invest heavily in global expansion and
in new technology, such as its new home-banking terminal, the
"Enhanced Telephone."
   In addition, Citicorp is in a neck-and-neck race with
American Express Co. to be the world's biggest issuer of
charge and credit cards. It also has become the nation's
biggest originator and servicer of residential mortgages.
   And despite the criticism of Citicorp's reserve position,
it is in better shape than it was under Walter Wriston, Mr.
Reed's predecessor. When Mr. Reed became chairman, reserves
were less than $1 billion; today, after increases in 1987 and
1989, they total $4.6 billion. And in the past three years,
Citicorp has worked down its developing-country debt to an
$8.4 billion problem from an $11 billion one.
   "We've actually made some pretty good progress against our
vision" of what the bank should do, Mr. Reed says. For much
of his chairmanship, his energies have been consumed by the
developing-countries debt problem. "I can't begin to tell you
the degree of distraction that it has been," he says. "I
personally think that when we look back on this period we'll
give ourselves pretty high marks for how we managed the
problem."
   "I give him good marks, not top marks," Ronald Mandle, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., comments. "He's more
visionary than most bankers, and he's bought shares with his
own money, unlike other New York bank managements. His
interests are more aligned with shareholders."
   Mr. Reed complains, however, that something beyond the
bank's control has repeatedly cropped up and kept it from
achieving its financial goals. What he calls the
"externalities" blighting the 1990 outlook are the weakening
commercial-real-estate market and the disappearance of highly
leveraged corporate buy-outs.
   So, when will the dark clouds blow away? "My guess," Mr.
Reed says, "is that you're going to see that in 1992 to
1995." By then, he explains, the danger of developing-country
loans will have been defused, and real-estate markets should
be rebounding.
   Citicorp is the nation's largest lender on commercial real
estate. Since 1985, Citicorp's portfolio of such loans has
more than doubled to $12.8 billion. However, its past-due
real-estate loans and foreclosures have surged fivefold to
$1.6 billion from $303 million. Further increases are likely;
downturns in real-estate cycles typically last two to three
years. Similarly, Citicorp's $7.9 billion of loans to highly
leveraged transactions includes nearly $700 million of loans
in trouble.
   As big as the numbers are, those two types of loans pose
less of a threat to Citicorp than to other banks.
Commercial-real-estate loans make up only 10% and highly
leveraged transactions only 5% of Citicorp's $160 billion
loan portfolio. Most large banks show higher percentages.
   Moreover, Citicorp's real-estate portfolio is well
diversified geographically. Only 3% of it is in hard-hit New
England; the largest exposure, 21%, is in the healthy
California market.
   Citicorp contends that even in troubled leveraged
buy-outs, such as Campeau's Allied and Federated units, which
owe Citicorp $288 million, its position is fully secured and
insulated against losses. But banks do lose money on some
deals.
   For all today's problem loans, Mr. Reed is upbeat about
Citicorp's prospects. "If you're concerned about my
temperature," he says, "I'm feeling better about where we are
than I was three years ago."
   To unleash the profit potential of the consumer
businesses, analysts and consultants suggest that Citicorp
should dump its money-losing Quotron subsidiary, slash staff
and expenses and cut deeply into commercial lending in North
America, Europe and Japan. Though once accounting for nearly
all of Citicorp's earnings, commercial banking in the
developed countries may earn only $160 million this year.
"Traditional commercial banking, as practiced by most banks,
is only a 7% return-on-equity business," says James McCormick
of First Manhattan Consulting Group.
   Citicorp has reined in some commercial-banking activities.
In commercial real estate, for instance, Citicorp is
stressing less risky roles for itself, such as arranging
sales, debt and equity investments. In the past month, Mr.
Reed has met individually with more than three dozen of
Citicorp's large real-estate customers to gauge market
conditions and to assure them that the bank isn't abandoning
the business.
   Citicorp also has shut down -- with much embarrassment --
big money-losing ventures, such as its Citicorp Scrimgeour
Vickers securities dealer in London and its underwriting of
municipal securities in the U.S. And it is pursuing its
hard-won corporate securities underwriting powers with far
less elan than Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp;
Co.
   Meanwhile, Michael A. Callen, who heads Citicorp's
commercial and investment banking for North America, Europe
and Japan, is preparing a plan to focus Citicorp's resources
on about six profitable lines of business, according to bank
officers. However, Mr. Reed rejects suggestions that he shut
down traditional commercial-banking businesses in the
developed countries. "Intellectually and culturally, it's
still the heart of the business," and a "solid" commercial
business can be built in those nations, he says. "There are
very few consumer-only financial companies that are
exciting."
   The information business, which in the first quarter of
this year lost money at a $164 million annual rate, is
another drain on earnings that is off-limits to cost-cutters.
Much of that loss is simply amortization of the premium paid
in the $628 million acquisition of Quotron in 1986. However,
with all the cost-cutting on Wall Street, the stock-price
service is losing money on an operating basis, too.
   All along, Mr. Reed has said the information business is
in the incubation stage and won't contribute significantly to
profits until the mid-1990s. Citicorp is investing heavily in
it. It is developing a consumer marketing information system
that gives retailers new ways to target consumers for
promotions. And Quotron is developing a trading terminal for
government bond dealers and a foreign-exchange trading
terminal, called FX Trader, that shows promise of making
inroads against Reuters Holdings PLC's rival service. Last
year, Telerate Inc., which is owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co., the
publisher of this newspaper, also introduced its own
electronic foreign-exchange trading system, The Trading
Service.
   Mr. Reed confidently predicts Citicorp earnings will
triple to $5 billion by the mid to late 1990s. However, many
investors, weary of unfulfilled promises, can't help but
wonder whether Mr. Reed is referring to some massaged measure
of earnings. But others remain optimistic.
   "In 10 years, the question investors will ask each other,"
says Heiko Thieme, a fund manager at Deutsche Bank Capital
Corp., "will be: `Did you buy Citicorp?' Not, `What did you
pay for it?'"

   Kuwait Replaces Oil Minister Sheik Ali;
   Move Brings Mixed Reactions in Market

   Kuwait's Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, the last of the
colorful and brash OPEC oil ministers, has been replaced.
   His reassignment to the post of finance minister of the
Persian Gulf oil power briefly boosted oil markets as some
traders assumed he would no longer be that sheikdom's chief
oil strategist. Others who follow the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, however, cautioned that the
move might not be a repudiation of Sheik Ali's oil policies
so much as an extension of Mideast politics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sheik Ali is being replaced by Rashid Salem Al-Omari, a
Kuwait University professor and chemical engineer who is
virtually unknown outside Kuwait.
   A 44-year-old, London-educated economist, Sheik Ali has
been a vocal advocate of Kuwait pumping oil far above quotas
assigned it by OPEC. Such "cheating" has bloated world oil
supplies and depressed prices. Yesterday, the continuing
crude glut briefly drove prices down to nearly $15 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In the last hour,
futures prices for July delivery rebounded somewhat to end at
$15.30 a barrel, still off 35 cents on the day.
   People who monitor OPEC internal affairs suggested the job
change for Sheik Ali may mainly reflect efforts by Kuwait to
accommodate other major Middle Eastern oil producers in
trying to stablize relations in the wake of the Iran-Iraq
war. Sheik Ali has been a thorn in the side of Saudi Arabia,
Iran and Iraq, other powerful Persian Gulf producers who have
generally supported OPEC's production-limiting quotas.
   Indeed, a relaxed Sheik Ali, reached late last night at
his beachhouse in Kuwait, certainly didn't express any
disappointment over his reassignment. On the contrary, he
called it "a new challenge." He added: "I'm looking forward
to working with the domestic economy and Kuwait's
international investments."
   Sheik Ali's reassignment is part of a cabinet shuffle that
saw 11 of 20 positions change.
   Whether or not Kuwait's oil policy changes is immaterial
at the moment, anyway, traders say. Markets are currently
awash in crude oil, with terminals and other storage
facilities almost overflowing. And that doesn't take into
account tankers full of oil afloat on the ocean. Since the
beginning of the month, the price of crude for prompt
delivery has dropped by more than $2 a barrel. It could take
up to eight weeks to work off the excess oil.
   It is understood that Sheik Ali's replacement, Mr.
Al-Omari, is a close friend of Sheik Ali and that as a member
of the sheikdom's Supreme Petroleum Council until only two
months ago, he is familiar with and supportive of Kuwait's
past oil policy.
   Indeed, some who track OPEC believe that Sheik Ali, who
has been oil minister since 1978, will still play a major
role in setting that policy. They insist he isn't being
treated shabbily by his government, or being ousted as Sheik
Ahmed Zaki Yamani was by the Saudi Arabian government in 1986
after tangling with his nation's powerful King Fahd. Sheik
Ali is similar in temperament and showmanship to Sheik
Yamani.
   At one time Kuwait's acting finance minister, Sheik Ali
will be handling a $100 billion investment portfolio in his
new position. Kuwait, the most sophisticated of the Persian
Gulf countries, gets more than half its income from equity
investments and has huge refining networks in other nations
that offset some of the risks of crude oil markets.
   Kuwait, along with the United Arab Emirates, has
flagrantly exceeded its OPEC quota since November even though
Sheik Ali then agreed to honor an allotment of 1.5 million
barrels daily.
   As a result of months of overproduction, Kuwait has been
feeling pressure, particularly from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and
Iran. Saudi King Fahd has repeatedly called for all OPEC
members to honor their quotas. Iraq, which has been growing
in military might since its war with Iran halted, has accused
Kuwait of purposely driving oil prices down to keep Iraq's
war-torn economy in disarray.
   Individuals who follow Middle Eastern political
developments said that during the past month Kuwait has
discussed a possible nonaggression pact with Iraq, and may
negotiate funds to help Iraq develop its oil production
capacity. Removal of Sheik Ali from the high-profile role of
oil minister may be related to such moves, these sources
said.

   MORE AUTOMATION is needed, manufacturers say.
   Middle market manufacturers "are still in love with
technology as a solution to becoming more competitive in the
global marketplace," says Michael Cantwell of accountant
Grant Thornton. In a recent survey, some 67% of officials of
mid-size companies said use of advanced technologies by U.S.
industries is too low. The technologies most widely in use:
just-in-time inventory techniques and computer-aided design.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Continuing efforts to automate are keeping capital
spending growing despite the current economic slowdown, says
Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of
Manufacturers. But the best use of automation may be "minor
low-cost modifications" of existing equipment, says Roy
Harmon, an independent consultant with Arthur Anderson &amp; Co.
   When asked about their own companies, 40% said they were
automated enough. "We call this the `Not My Factory'
syndrome," Mr. Cantwell says.
                                                                                                       

   POOL BUILDERS say fewer people are taking the plunge.
   Sales at East Bay Gunite Inc., Livermore, Calif., stalled
in June, usually the company's biggest month. "People are
just a little less willing to plop down the money," says
George Aylwin, vice president, estimating that sales are off
15% from last year. "People are spooked. They aren't spending
their money," agrees Thomas Rogers, owner of Classic Pools
Inc., Roswell, Ga. Sales there are down 20%.
   Even those that claim healthy sales admit business is down
from the mid-80s boom. "Five years ago we couldn't find the
time to do all the work," says Ed Kaminski of Aqua-Qual
Swimming Pool Co., Farmingdale, N.Y. In California, the
drought is making pool sales even tougher. "Psychologically,
people just aren't comfortable with the idea of new pools
when the state is suffering from water shortages," says
Stephen Zall of Aqua Blue Pools, San Jose. One bright spot:
Last October's earthquake damaged some pools so badly that
they're cheaper to replace than repair, he says.
                                                                                                       

   A GREENER GNP finds growing support among economists.
   Current measures of national income "take into account
changes in our net worth with respect to buildings and
equipment," but not our natural resources, says Robert
Repetto of the World Resources Institute, Washington. A
handful of countries, including Norway, France and West
Germany, are actively working on such environmental
accounting. Within five years, he says, there could be "a
methodological and empirical base on which to revise the
definition of national income."
   Such changes are especially important for developing
countries "because they are so heavily resource-based," says
Henry Peskin of Edgevale Associates, Silver Spring, Md. With
funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, he is
developing a set of accounts on Chesapeake Bay. Greg Michaels
of the EPA views creation of a "green" GNP as unlikely, but
says linkages between the economy and the environment are
clearly being established.
   The National Accounts Experts will devote a third of its
annual meeting next month to incorporating environmental
quality into national accounts.
                                                                                                       

   LATE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS were at their lowest level in a
decade during the first quarter, says the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America. That's good news for the economy,
says MBA's Warren Lasko, predicting lower foreclosure rates
will follow.
                                                                                                       

   STAYING DRY is one answer to water pollution worries,
finds a Coors Pure Water survey. Some 56% of those surveyed
say they have cut back water recreation activities at
beaches, lakes and rivers. In the Northeast, that number hit
71%.
                                                                                                       

   PHYSICIANS WHO REFER to specialists often end up losing
patients. The Medical Tribune found some 37% of family and
general practitioners lost patients because of referrals in
the last year, with the average loss eight patients per
doctor.
                                                                                                       

   KIDS' ELECTRONICS move beyond the toy tape recorder.
   With their eye on demographics, some major consumer
electronics companies are taking aim at the toddler and
pre-adolescent set. "This market offers tremendous
opportunity," says Buddy Paris of KIDdesigns Inc., a firm
formed by Soundesign Corp. to create products under the
Playskool name. Sony Corp. of America, which helped pioneer
the kidtronics market with its My First Sony line, is seeing
sales jump 20% a year. It's latest entry: an electronic
sketchboard that can be hooked up to the TV screen.
   Introduced first in Japan, Sanyo Fisher Corp.'s Robo line
is designed with brightly colored, interchangeable panels
that can be removed with a screwdriver, which is included.
"We want children to master motor and cognitive skills," says
Stewart Cyment, national product manager. Products include a
talking alarm clock, a programmable telephone and sing-along
machine with applause button.
   Targeting kids is one way to build brand loyalty early,
says Sony's Marnix Van Gemert, who expects further line
expansion.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Petite clothing sales more than doubled from 1983
to 1989, while the overall women's apparel market grew only
35%, says MRCA Information Services. . . . Car phones are the
fastest growing executive perk in the U.S., says the National
Institute of Business Management.

   Grand Jury Indicts
   Husband and Wife
   In Thrift Scheme

   WASHINGTON -- A federal grand jury indicted a husband and
wife, both former officers of Republic Bank for Savings of
Jackson, Miss., on charges of falsifying bank reports and
other charges.
   The grand jury in Jackson charged Philip Shunk and Linda
Shunk with conspiring to misapply the bank's funds, with
three counts of making false bank entries, and with one count
of converting one share of Country Club of Jackson stock held
by the bank to their own use. Mr. Strunk was charged with
seven additional counts of making false entries in bank
reports.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If convicted of all charges, Mr. Shunk faces a maximum
penalty of 65 years in prison and a $3 million fine. Mrs.
Shunk faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1.25 million
fine.
   Mr. Shunk was president of the federally chartered thrift
from October 1985 until December 1987, when he resigned. He
was succeeded by his wife, who had been executive vice
president. She remained president until she was removed by
federal regulators when they took control of Republic in July
1988.
   News of the indictment came as the House overwhelmingly
approved $75 million in fiscal 1991 appropriations for
Justice Department prosecutions and civil proceedings related
to financial institutions. That represents more than a 50%
increase above the current spending. The money was added to a
pending bill that would provide $10.5 billion for the
Justice, State, and Commerce Departments for the new budget
year, which begins Oct. 1.
   Separately, the Justice Department said that the 93 U.S.
attorneys have been called to Washington for a meeting
tomorrow with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh concerning
prosecution of savings and loan fraud cases. The department
said President Bush will speak to the prosecutors.
   Yesterday, a private government watchdog group accused the
Bush administration of tardy and weak prosecution of S&amp;L
fraud. Federal prosecutions have recouped less than 1% of
taxpayers' losses that are attributable to fraud, collecting
less than $100 million in restitution and fines, according to
Public Citizen, a Ralph Nader-backed group.
   "Our study leads to an inescapable, disturbing conclusion:
The Bush administration's efforts to pursue and punish S&amp;L
fraud have been anemic at best," said Sherry Ettleson of
Public Citizen.
   Such comments, and the lopsided 420-1 House vote to
increase government funds for cracking down on financial
wrongdoers, reflect the increasing political volatility of
the S&amp;L issue. But President Bush, speaking at a news
conference during a speaking trip to Alabama, declined to
repeat this week's White House assertions that Democrats are
to blame for much of the S&amp;L mess and subsequent bailout. Mr.
Bush said he doesn't want to "be out there saying here's
who's to blame and here's who's not to blame."
   Mr. Bush, sounding a theme his administration intends to
repeat more and more to deflect its handling of the crisis,
promised "plenty more" prosecutions of thrift officials who
violated laws. Mr. Bush said he met with Mr. Thornburgh this
week to discuss the cases being brought and said his
administration will "put those that are guilty into the dock
where they belong and see that they are brought to
responsibility for what they've done."

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush has decided to name a Vermont
lawyer to the federal bench -- nearly 16 months after Sen.
James Jeffords recommended the nomination and a week after
the liberal Republican backed Mr. Bush on a veto override.
   The lawyer, Fred Parker of Weybridge, Vt., was telephoned
by Mr. Bush Tuesday night, according to Mr. Jeffords's
office, which denied any connection between the timing of the
appointment and the senator's support for a Bush veto of an
Amtrak authorization bill seven days before.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The appointment, for the U.S. District Court in
Burlington, Vt., is subject to Senate confirmation, and Mr.
Parker is expected to win approval easily.
   Labor unions backing the Amtrak legislation initially had
counted Mr. Jeffords among their supporters in the fight,
which centered on the Bush administration's objections to a
provision requiring the Interstate Commerce Commission to
review the purchase of major freight railroads by non-rail
companies. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, in
partnership with Union Pacific Corp. Chairman Drew Lewis,
painted the bill as a return to rail regulation, and a White
House lobbying campaign prevailed by a margin of two votes in
the Senate.
   In an interview before the vote, Mr. Jeffords said he
favored such legislation to deal with smaller freight lines
like those in New England, but as the provision dealt only
with Class I, or the nation's 16 biggest railroads, he felt
free to back Mr. Bush on the regulation issue. "If it's not
an issue that Jim feels affects the state or disadvantages
his constituents, he is more apt to listen to the president,"
a Jeffords aide said.
   "He was a hard vote to get," a person familiar with the
administration's lobbying said of Sen. Jeffords. "What it
took, I do not know."
   Mr. Parker's nomination is an issue that the senator has
taken personally, and he was infuriated last year over the
long delays by the White House in nominating his friend to
the federal court. In November, Mr. Jeffords held up action
on eight other nominees to register his protest, but an aide
to the senator said a reconciliation had been reached well
before the veto vote and he was only awaiting final word from
the president.

   Lawrenceville, N.J. -- For her April wedding, Karen Crowe,
nee Mayer, had a reception for 80 people at a lakefront
restaurant with music by a local disc jockey. When Jill
Bulanda, nee Gillespie, married later that month, there were
six bridesmaids in royal blue, bagpipes outside the church
and polka music at the reception for 161. And last Saturday,
Ronnell Hardrick, nee Talley, marched down the aisle trailing
four bridesmaids, one maid of honor, one matron of honor and
two flower girls -- all dressed in black-and-white -- as
nearly 200 guests looked on.
   They had never met, but these New Jersey brides had one
thing in common: their wedding dress. A frothy confection of
rose-patterned lace with a cathedral train, scalloped Queen
Anne neckline and a keyhole back filled in with 12 strands of
ersatz pearls, the dress, No. 1506, is one of 250 wedding
gowns rented out by a small shop in this comfortable exurban
town.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although traditionalists and romantics may scoff, the
"something borrowed" for today's cost-conscious bride may
well be her wedding dress.
   "They are wanting a look that's in all the bridal
magazines at $1,500 and realizing that's a couch or one
month's rent," said Shirley Tyndale, whose Fantasies
Unlimited has been renting out wedding gowns for the past
five years. "My motto here has become, you can rent a wedding
gown or buy a box."
   With many couples paying for all or part of their wedding,
the dress of a bride's dreams may be outside her budget.
Buying the gown is only the beginning: The prospective bride
must shell out even more money for alterations, a hoop skirt,
headpiece and veil. And when the wedding is over, it can cost
more than $200 to have the dress drycleaned and packed
between sheets of acid-free paper for storage that just could
last longer than the marriage.
   A modest stucco building on New Jersey's busy Route 1,
Fantasies Unlimited is packed to the gills with sequin- and
pearl-encrusted gowns. Nearly 1,750 frocks, including
ballgowns, prom dresses and mother-of-the-bride dresses, hang
from color-coded racks in the downstairs showroom. The
wedding dresses are crowded upstairs, where pearl headbands,
filmy wedding hats and tulle veils -- all for rent -- vie for
available wall space.
   "The mom and daughter sit here," Ms. Tyndale said, showing
off a tiny upstairs fitting room cozy with armchairs, gauzy
curtains and a cheval glass. "I'd ask her if she was
interested in renting or buying. People say, `People rent
wedding dresses?' And I say, `Well your groom is going to
rent a tux]' . . . When I show them a $1,000 dress that rents
for $500 to $600, which includes alterations and everything,
then they'd rather do that." Although use of a fluffy
crinoline is thrown in for free, the headpiece and veil can
cost an additional $50 to $120.
   A Jean Phoenix design with a $795 price tag, No. 1506
rents for $350 (the most expensive gowns go for $650). The
dress already has clocked five weddings since its purchase in
July, but until they saw it, none of its recent tenants had
planned on marrying in something borrowed.
   "You think to yourself, `Oh Jeez, do I want to rent?
You're supposed to keep your wedding dress,'" said Ms.
Bulanda, a vivacious 24-year-old who also rented her
bridesmaids' dresses through the store. "Then I said, this is
silly to spend so much money on something I'm never going to
wear again, not even for Halloween."
   These brides also were unconvinced by arguments that
today's pricey wedding dress is tomorrow's family heirloom.
   "If I'd have bought it, it just would have been sitting in
my closet till I had kids, and my daughter decided it was out
of style," Ms. Crowe said.
   Of course, no bride wants a gown that looks as if it's
been to the altar one time too many. Dresses are sent to the
cleaners after each wedding (during the busy summer season,
the shop's dry-cleaning bills total more than $2,000 a
month), and small tears are covered up with lacy appliques.
   "People have spilled things, ripped things -- underarm
stains -- we deal with a lot of that," Ms. Tyndale said. "I
have dresses that I have had {go out} five, six, seven times.
I have dresses that after the second time I don't use again."
   Dresses are altered to suit each bride. Plunging necklines
and open backs are filled in with sheer organza for Orthodox
Jewish weddings and more modest brides, while less retiring
types opt for extra sequins and beading. Sleeves are
routinely added and removed. Because each dress will be used
again, excess material is never cut, but gets hemmed in or
gathered up under peplums and bustles. For tall brides, a
false back can be put on a bow to gain several needed inches
of material, or lace added to the hem. The shop also stocks
extra pieces of fabric in case a few gussets around the hips
are needed.
   No. 1506, which entered life as a size 10, has been taken
up at the shoulders, let out at the seams and widened with
inserts of extra material. It has been rehemmed, rebustled
and partnered with a variety of veils and headpieces to suit
its different tenants. But those other brides did not matter
to Ms. Gillespie, as she then was. She had visited No. 1506
every week since she booked it in July.
   "I consider it mine. They all borrowed my dress," she
said, smiling at her reflection, as Ms. Tyndale repositioned
the tiny hoops that would gather up the long train into a
more manageable bustle. "Oh, I feel like I belong on a cake
top]"
   Less than two months later, the former Ms. Talley was
laying her claim to 1506, as her mother and her two-month-old
baby daughter looked on.
   "It's real wide, like a Shirley Temple {dress}, like
Cinderella dresses," said Ms. Talley, fluffing the lace
skirts. To make it wider still, she opted for a six-hoop
crinoline underneath, the puffiest one available.
   By this time, the dress was in need of some minor repairs
and alterations. The organza ruffle at the hem was frayed in
places ("John stepped on the bustle a few times, and I'm sure
it didn't have anything to do with the vodka and 7-Ups he was
drinking," Ms. Bulanda recalled). And Ms. Talley herself had
changed shape since she first tried the dress on last June
and found it on the roomy side. After the birth of her baby,
Olivia, she couldn't help noticing that 1506 was more than a
little tight around the hips.
   "See what you did to me?" Ms. Talley scolded Olivia, who
sat quietly on the lap of her grandmother Jill Fitchett.
   "A two-inch piece on each side," Ms. Tyndale later
instructed one of her staffers. "We'll have to match the
material."
   The summer is far from over for 1506. After Ms. Hardrick's
wedding, it has just a few weeks' rest on the rack before it
hits the aisle for the sixth time next month. When its lace
and organza finally look too tired for yet another round of
the wedding march from "Lohengrin," the dress will either be
sold for a bargain price or donated to a church sale or local
theatrical group.
   Of course, some brides do end up keeping the dress they
only intended to borrow. No. 1506 was ordered to replace an
identical dress that was bought by one such bride -- who
first had to return it for a previously booked wedding. But
the brides who've worn 1506 suffered no sentimental pangs
when it came time to return the dress to the shop.
   "Actually, I couldn't wait to get the stupid thing off at
the end of the night," Ms. Bulanda said.
   By the time she stopped by to visit Ms. Tyndale after her
honeymoon, 1506 was already a thing of the past."I didn't
even ask to see it," she said.

   UtiliCorp United Inc., Kansas City, Mo., said it expects
to report a 13% drop in its second quarter earnings to $4.8
million, or 12 cents a share, from $5.5 million, or 21 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue is expected to rise 15% to $154 million from $134
million, it said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a presentation to analysts in Columbus, Ohio,
UtiliCorp's chairman, Richard C. Green, said second quarter
results are typically its lowest of the year because of
"normal seasonal declines in gas and electric sales." He also
cited the need for rate relief in key jurisdictions and the
sale in January of income-producing natural gas reserve
properties as reasons for the decline.
   For the first six months, the company said it expects to
earn $27.8 million, or $1.03 a share, on revenue of $432
million. In the previous year, the utility earned $23.1
million, or $1.03 a share, on revenue of $354 million.
   UtiliCorp said despite the declines in the second quarter,
it is still "on track" for a solid year, provided it receives
adequate rate relief for its Missouri Public Service division
in the fourth quarter.

   Media General Inc., Richmond, Va., said it put up for sale
its Garden State Paper Co.'s newsprint recycling mill in
Garfield, N.J.
   Media General said the planned sale is part of its
strategy to concentrate on its communications properties,
which include daily newspapers, network-affiliated broadcast
television stations, and cable TV systems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Media General hired Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to handle the
sale of the recycling mill; an asking price wasn't disclosed.
The mill has 220,000-ton capacity and will be sold with
related recycling centers and other waste-paper operations. A
Garden State Paper official said that an oversupply of
newsprint in the market has led to depressed prices for
newsprint, but that recycled newsprint, which is in greater
demand, is scarce and selling at premium prices.
   Media General will retain its one-third ownership in a
recycled-newsprint operation in Dublin, Ga., which it owns
with Knight-Ridder Inc. and Cox Enterprises Inc.

   GPA Group PLC of Ireland, an aircraft lessor, said it
signed a 10-year lease agreement with the Canton region of
the Civil Aviation Administration of China for five 737-300
planes and five 737-500s made by Boeing Co., Seattle.
   The new aircraft, which will be delivered between December
1990 and December 1991, will enter service with China
Southern, the new airline that will replace the Canton CAAC
regional administration in September. As part of the
agreement, GPA said, it will buy 10 older-version 737s from
CAAC and lease them to airlines in China or elsewhere.

   GPA said the agreement represents the first time a Chinese
airline has signed for a so-called operating lease -- a
relatively short-term, off-balance-sheet rental -- of
passenger jetliners. The company estimated that China will
need to lease or buy 400 more jetliners in the next 15 years.

   WASHINGTON -- Legislation authorizing U.S. participation
in the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
which is expected to start approving loans to Eastern
European countries next year, cleared its first hurdle in
Congress.
   A House Banking subcommittee approved a bill that would
allow the White House and the Treasury to provide $1.2
billion of the $12 billion envisioned as the bank's initial
capital. Congress would be expected to appropriate about $360
million of this amount over a five-year period. The remainder
of the U.S. pledge would be in the form of a callable capital
commitment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, the White House asked the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees to approve the first $70 million
installment of the proposed U.S. "paid-in" capital.
   In other action, the House panel agreed to authorize about
$3.18 billion to help finance loans by the International
Development Association to poorer Third World nations. The
U.S. and other countries have agreed to channel about $15
billion to the World Bank affiliate over three years. The
U.S. share still would have to be approved by the House and
Senate Appropriations committees.
   The subcommittee also voted to allocate about $500 million
in funds for the U.S. Export-Import Bank for "tied-aid" loans
to help U.S. companies compete for business in Eastern
Europe. Such loans could be approved when other western
nations offer export credits on highly-concessional terms in
an effort to win contracts for companies in their countries.

   PHILADELPHIA -- U S West Inc. and Bell Atlantic Corp. said
they agreed to form a joint venture with the Czechoslovakian
government to build a public data network in that country.
   The three parties together would invest about $45 million
over 10 years to develop the country's first public switched
packet data network, a U S West spokesman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement would give the regional Bells a 49% stake in
the joint venture and the Czech Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications a 51% ownership.
   Construction is expected to begin in the next few months
after the agreement is signed, and data network service
initially connecting Prague, Bratislava and Brno is due to
start in 1992. Czechoslovakia has a population of about 15.5
million people and about 2.2 million telephone lines.
   Construction costs would be paid in hard currency, while
wages would be covered with the local currency, U S West
said.
   The agreement is the second in a week for the two regional
Bells, which were selected by the Czech government Friday to
build and operate a cellular telephone network in that
country.
   A switched packet data network allows large amounts of
information to be sent "more efficiently" than a steady data
stream, U S West said.
   "Data transmission over a high-quality network is
important to the economy and development of a country," U S
West said.

lowered to Baa-2 from A-3, and its commercial paper was cut
to Prime-2 from Prime-1. Ratings on the company's General
Dynamics Credit Corp. unit also were lowered by like amounts.
   Moody's announcement was made shortly before the end of
trading. General Dynamics stock closed at $34.50, off 62.5
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   The reductions for senior and subordinated debt are by two
notches, a sharper cut than the one-notch reductions that
Moody's made recently on McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Grumman
Corp. securities. General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas are
based in St. Louis. Grumman is based in Bethpage, N.Y. Mr.
Philipakkos said that both of General Dynamics' competitors
had been more recently downgraded, while General Dynamics had
remained at its peak rating.
   Moody's said General Dynamics is heavily dependent on
military contracts, citing particularly expected production
cuts for the Army's M-1 tank and the Air Force's F-16
fighter.

   Commodities:
   Precious Metals Futures Prices Stage Recovery
   From Sharp Declines to Post Moderate Increases

   NEW YORK -- Precious metals futures prices recovered from
sharp early declines to end with moderate gains.
   August delivery gold finished up $1.30 an ounce at
$353.10, after trading as low as $349.50. July silver
rebounded from a drop to $4.7650 to close at $4.842, for a
net gain of 1.5 cents an ounce. Platinum, which is the most
thinly traded precious metal and is most sensitive to price
movements, ended with the best gain. The July contract rose
$5.90 an ounce to $482.10 after first dropping to $473.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A strong dollar and weaker oil prices contributed to
early declines in precious metals," said Craig Sloane,
precious metals analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.,
New York.
   Silver was the weakest market on the way down, and the
July contract came close to testing its life-of-contract low
of $4.7620.
   "However, good demand came in later and helped precious
metals as a whole to recover," Mr. Sloane said.
   Rumors that South African gold mining companies may close
some mines because of the current low price of the metal and
news service reports that South African gold miners have
called for a strike on July 2, also contributed to the rally,
said Ian MacDonald, vice president, Credit Suisse, New York.
   "There has been concern over whether or not some mines
could continue operating with the present low prices," Mr.
MacDonald said. "If that's the case, where will the needed
gold come from?"
   There was good demand for gold bullion from the Far East
and the Middle East, Mr. MacDonald said. "Basically, it looks
like the market is trying to bottom out."
   Don Mackay-Coghill, chief executive officer of Goldcorp
Australia, the holding company of the Perth Mint in Perth,
Australia, observed that the "feeling in many quarters is
that the buying was by the same Saudi Arabian interests that
have been recent strong sellers."
   "Gold is grasping for a bottom as the selling is becoming
exhausted," said James Kneafsey, president of Cambridge
Financial Management of Cambridge, Mass. "Evidence is that
gold recovered while the dollar was still strong and despite
oil's weakness, two traditional depressants on gold."
   Added Ken Gettinger, vice president, precious metals, for
Union Bank of Switzerland, New York branch, "It was a very
encouraging market, with the heaviest volume we have seen in
months."
   Technically, gold and silver had been heavily oversold,
and strong demand developed when they held at the lows of the
day, Mr. Gettinger said. "Buying was helped by reports of
labor problems in South Africa. Most significantly, there was
heavy selling while the rally was in progress, but it was
well-absorbed by the buying."
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices traded over a wide range and
ended mostly lower. Only the July contract finished higher,
rising 7.30 cents a pound to $1.74. September finished with a
loss of 3.40 cents at $1.6870, and other deferred months were
also lower. The final prices yesterday created a premium for
the July contract over September, a reversal of the previous
day, when July was at a discount to September. One analyst
said that change could reflect concern over obtaining
supplies of the concentrate for immediate delivery. Prices
fluctuated widely during the day. The July contract rose its
daily limit of 10 cents a pound before selling trimmed the
advance. September rose and fell sharply, trading as low as
$1.6410, a limit eight-cent decline, and as high as $1.7990,
a range of 15.80 cents. Trading was very choppy, said William
Adams, analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in Orlando, Fla. "We had
100-point moves from trade to trade at times," he said. A
point is one-hundredth of a cent. Contributing to the
independent strength in the July delivery, Mr. Adams said,
was buying back of contracts by previous short sellers who
wanted to get out of their positions because the first day on
which delivery notices will be issued, July 2, is
approaching.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: A morning rally in grain prices ran
out of steam when forecasters began predicting a respite from
the unusually heavy rains that have slowed planting and
damaged crops. Soybean prices soared early in the trading
session amid reports of widespread flooding in Iowa. But near
the close of trading, some private meteorologists erased rain
from their forecasts. After the close of trading, the
National Weather Service's six-to-10-day forecast called for
below-normal chances of rain in the Midwest. Dry weather
would erode grain prices by improving growing conditions of
many wet fields, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. Prices of
soybean futures contracts finished moderately higher, while
prices of most corn futures contracts settled slightly lower.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices fell on a possible large buildup in
supplies. July delivery copper declined 3.15 cents a pound to
$1.0985. Analysts said fresh selling developed after Reuter
reported that London Metal Exchange inventories of copper
were expected to rise 30,000 tons over the next three weeks.
The exchange issues reports on its copper inventories on
Tuesdays and Fridays. According to one analyst, traders
believe exchange supplies will increase, but not that
quickly. However, the report triggered selling that depressed
prices, he said.

   VAN NUYS, Calif. -- Pinkerton's Inc. said it completed a
refinancing that includes the private placement of $60
million in 10-year, senior notes with two insurance
companies, which weren't identified, and the establishment of
a new, $50 million line of credit with a banking group led by
Citicorp, New York.
   The security and investigative concern also said a
competitor's lawsuit was dismissed recently by a federal
court in New York. The litigation, filed in April by
Guardsmark Inc., a private security services company based in
Memphis, Tenn., alleged that Pinkerton's engaged in unfair
and deceptive practices in the use of a personality
assessment test to screen prospective employees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new senior notes bear a 10.35% interest rate and
include provisions for sinking funds in the final six years.
The $50 million line of credit consists of a $40 million
letter-of-credit facility and a $10 million revolving line of
credit.
   Proceeds from the new financing will be used to repay
about $55 million in term and subordinated debt with higher
interest rates. Pinkerton's has said it will take a $2.6
million accounting charge as an extraordinary item in the
current quarter to write off deferred financing charges
related to the earlier debt.

   Higher Lymph-Cancer Risk
   Is Noted in AIDS Survivors
</HL>
<DATE>

</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B4
</SO>
<LP>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Long-term AIDS survivors stand a nearly
50% risk of developing lymph cancer after three years, a
federal scientist said.
   The new and higher figures are scheduled to be presented
today at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS. AIDS
researchers around the country have observed a surge in the
cancer, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma affecting
B-cells.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But while those reseachers reported a 10% to 20% incidence
of the cancer, Robert Yarchoan of the National Cancer
Institute said that after three years on the medication AZT
for AIDS or severe AIDS related complex (ARC), the risk of
lymphoma runs 46%.
   Researchers so far can only speculate about reasons for
the rise in cancer. "We can't rule out that it's the drug,
but we think it's unlikely," he said. Rather, he said AZT may
be helping fend off death from infecton, but allowing an
erosion of the immune system that permits the cancer to
overtake the body.
   Supporting this thesis, he said patients who developed
lymphoma were so immuno-suppressed that their counts of
infection-fighting T4-cells had declined from a normal level
of about 1000 to a median level of just six.
   "We're concerned that people not become too discouraged
about this," he said. "It simply underscores the point that
retroviruses, the family of viruses to which AIDS belongs,
are oncogenic or cancer-causing viruses."

   WASHINGTON -- The Democratic majority on the House Rules
Committee sent the flag-desecration amendment to the House
floor for a vote today despite particularly savage demands by
Republicans to wait until next week.
   The GOP wanted to use the weekend to round up votes for
the proposed constitutional amendment, but Speaker Thomas
Foley (D., Wash.) pushed for bringing it to the floor
quickly. The vote is expected to be close.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   During debate on the floor, Rep. Gerald Solomon (R., N.Y.)
accused Mr. Foley of "kowtowing to the ilk like the Communist
Youth Brigade to allow them to trample and desecrate our
American flag." His remarks were challenged as improper by
Rep. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), and he was forced to
withdraw them after a ruling by Speaker Pro Tempore Jolene
Unsoeld (D., Wash.) that they violated House rules concerning
proper debate.
   The House Judiciary Committee voted 19-17 Tuesday to send
the amendment to the floor without recommendation. The Rules
Committee, 9-4, set the vote for today, waiving the normal
three-day waiting period.
   Speaker Foley said there was no reason to delay the
measure, which he said had been "debated and discussed as
much as any other legislative proposal of this Congress."

   NEW YORK -- New notes and bonds continued to flood the
credit market yesterday, as more than $5.5 billion of
asset-backed, municipal and corporate debt was offered to
investors.
   Dealers said the huge supply, coming on top of $3 billion
of new debt issued Tuesday, overwhelmed demand and put
downward pressure on bond prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell
nearly 1/2 point, or $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
its price, rose to 8.51%.
   The large volume of new bonds issued yesterday "was a big
contributing factor to the down move," in bond prices, said
Joel Kazis, a trading manager at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. He said that some dealers, who may have held large
inventories of unsold corporate, asset-backed and municipal
bonds, were hedging their positions by selling Treasury notes
and bonds.
   "There's not enough retail participation in this market,"
said Mr. Kazis. "I don't know where all this supply is
going."
   Surprisingly, among the best selling issues yesterday was
Chrysler Corp.'s $1 billion of securities backed by auto
loans. Even though the auto maker's debt has been downgraded
recently and is under review for further possible downgrade,
investors had a strong appetite for the securities.
   The Chrysler issue, which has an expected average life of
1.58 years, was priced at 99.855 with a coupon of 9.25% to
yield 9.27% by Salomon Brothers Inc.
   But several municipal bond and several asset-backed issues
that were offered yesterday and Tuesday are having problems
being placed.
   The market was also hurt by news that Australia's Westpac
Banking Corp. will close its Westpac Pollock Government
Securities Inc. subsidiary immediately. Westpac Pollock was a
primary dealer of government securities, an exclusive and
highly competitive group of bond dealers that do business
directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   Bond prices moved lower on the news as investors worried
that Westpac might dump its inventory. "If they are going out
of business, they have to get rid of that inventory and that
means more supply," said Barbara Kenworthy, a portfolio
manager at Dreyfus Corp.
   The market also received negative news in the form of the
latest edition of the Federal Reserve's "Beige Book," which
reported that there is continued slow growth in the economy
with little change in the underlying inflation rate.
   In a market where investors thrive on bad news, the Beige
Book findings were a "disappointment," said Christopher
Rupkey, a financial economist at Mitsubishi Bank. "People
thought the report would show that the economy was
deteriorating," but instead it showed that the economy is
growing slowly, he said.
   The Beige Book is a summary of economic activity prepared
for use at the central bank's next Federal Open Market
Committee meeting, on July 2 to 3.
   Late in the day, bond prices slipped further when the
Treasury announced it will hold record auctions next week for
two-year and four-year notes. The Treasury announced it will
sell a record $11.25 billion of two-year notes next Tuesday
and will sell a record $8.25 billion of four-year notes next
Wednesday.
   In when-issued activity that kicked off immediately after
the Treasury's announcement, the new two-year notes are
quoted at a yield of 8.39% while the new four-year notes were
quoted at 8.49%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. gyrated wildly as
high-yield investors flocked to trade the bonds following a
report that a major refinancing of RJR is under way.
   Traders estimate more than $500 million of RJR's widely
held payment-in-kind bonds were exchanged yesterday in
extremely volatile trading. Payment-in-kind bonds pay
interest in the form of additional securities instead of
cash.
   The hectic activity was sparked by an article in
yesterday's Wall Street Journal that reported that RJR
Nabisco and its main shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co., have begun a refinancing effort that will include the
retirement of more than $4 billion of RJR's junk bonds.
   In response, RJR's 14.07% convertible pay-in-kind
debentures, due in 2009, finished up 6 1/4 points at 97 1/8
on the New York Stock Exchange. The 14.07% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended 4 1/4 points
higher at 80 5/8.
   The advance in the RJR bonds triggered gains in other
actively traded high-yield securities with most issues
climbing between 1/4 to 1/2 point.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Prices of municipal bonds fell between 1/8 and 3/8 points
yesterday as a deluge of new supply overwhelmed demand.
   Among the largest new issues yesterday was Massachusetts'
$453 million in general obligation bonds. The bonds were
priced to yield from 6.10% for bonds that mature in the year
1991 to 7.50% for zero-coupon bonds, also called capital
appreciation bonds, that mature in 2001 and 2002. Zeros pay
no interest and are issued at a deep discount to face amount.
   Massachusetts now has the lowest credit rating of any
state and its debt is currently under review for further
possible downgrade. Still, underwriters at Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. said the bonds were well received by investors, due in
part because the bonds carried different forms of bondholder
protection such as bond insurance and a letter of credit from
several Japanese banks and one U.S. bank.
   Many of the other seven new municipal issues that were
offered yesterday were not as successful.
   Ahead on the calendar, the District of Columbia will sell
$50 million 3 1/2-month general obligation tax and revenue
anticipation notes today.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 13/32
to yield 8.51% compared with 102 27/32 to yield 8.47% on
Tuesday. Ten-year notes ended at a price of 102 4/32 to yield
8.53% compared with 102 11/32 to yield 8.50%.
   Treasury bill rates were little changed yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Debt issuance in the investment-grade corporate debt
market was extremely heavy as more than $3 billion of debt
was priced.
   Among the highlights of the session was Walt Disney Co.'s
$2.25 billion offering of zero-coupon convertible
subordinated notes.
   The securities were priced at $411.99 per $1,000
redemption amount for a yield to maturity of 6% through
underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The bonds are convertible into cash equal to the market
price of Euro Disneyland S.C.A., a publicly held French
company established to build and operate Euro Disneyland.
   The offering is the largest convertible-bond issue ever
and represents the first time that a zero-coupon bond
purchased by U.S. investors is convertible into the cash
equivalent of the price of a foreign stock.
   The debt sale will result in proceeds to the entertainment
concern of about $927 million.
   Investor demand for the issue was so strong that the size
was increased from an originally planned $1.5 billion.

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, resumed their
upward climb yesterday as international investors scrambled
to buy new securities.
   Gilts have been rising for weeks on speculation that
sterling will soon join the European Monetary System's
exchange-rate mechanism. Joining the ERM could be good for
gilts because it could help to stabilize the pound, force
Britain to contain inflation and eventually lead to lower
interest rates.
   In the most recent ERM news, Chancellor of the Exchequer
John Major discussed the issue in a speech yesterday. Mr.
Major repeated Britain's firm commitment to joining the ERM
when the government's "well-known conditions are met." Those
include a decline in British inflation close to the average
level in other EMS countries.
   Among benchmarks, Britain's 11.75% issue due 2003/2007
ended 1 3/8 points higher at 103 1/4 to yield 11.27% while
the 12% security due 1995 rose 23/32 to 100 13/32 to yield
11.89%. (Yields are quoted in local terms, but would be
slightly lower if calculated using the semiannual compound
measure used in the U.S.)
   In other markets, West German bonds ended modestly firmer
in quiet trading. Japanese government bonds ended weaker with
the yen, moving in a very narrow range due to the lack of
fresh economic or technical information.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities prices finished with modest
losses of 1/4 point or less.
   The mortgage securities market experienced "a slow day,"
said one trader. He said there was "a bid list out for short
CMOs," which are collateralized mortgage obligations, "that
was very well received."
   Otherwise, activity centered on the primary market, where
several real estate mortgage investment conduit issues and
another huge asset-backed offering, this one from Chrysler,
were priced.
   Among secondary issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues for July delivery were down 7/32 at
98 3/4, 10% securities were down 5/32 at 101 7/32; Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were off 6/32 at 98
3/32, 10% issues were 5/32 lower at 100 5/32; Federal
National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were off 6/32
at 98 19/32, 10% securities were down 7/32 at 100 5/8.

   Tokyo stocks settled higher after bouncing up and down
within a moderate range. Traders said that rounds of
arbitrage buying and scattered buying on incentive issues
added strength to the indexes.
   But performance on currency and bond markets was
disappointing, putting a cap on aggressive buying, traders
said.

   Meanwhile, London stocks finished a quiet session narrowly
mixed and little changed, as traders said investors awaited
the end of the quarter before opening fresh positions.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 47.38 points to
32087.76, after falling 336.42 points Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index added
another 51.33 points to 32139.09.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
400 million shares, up from 335 million shares Tuesday.
Advancers outpaced decliners 492 to 446, while 193 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section gained 12.87 points, or 0.55%, to 2366.80. The
second section index rose 2.52 points, or 0.06%, to 4147.58
on volume estimated at 23 million shares, off from 24.5
million shares Tuesday.
   Trading yesterday morning was lackluster, as softer yen
and bond performances led to unenthusiastic activity, while
scattered arbitrage buying lent some support.
   But traders said that professional investors sifted
through prospects for strong research-oriented companies,
buying shares that also seemed underpriced.
   The bargain hunting on incentive-backed issues remained
strong all day, as dealers passed the shares on to their
customers, who lured in the broader market, observers said.
   One domestic trader mentioned that talk among dealers in
the morning included theories that foreign investors,
particularly from the U.S., will get out of long cash
positions overseas and place their money in Japanese stocks.
"Especially in New York, many feel the market is overheated
and won't be improving for some time," he said.
   The Japanese trader felt that some dealers acted on the
speculation, resulting in the initial buying on
incentive-backed issues.
   On the other hand, financial conditions haven't really
turned to favor yen investments, observers noted.
   From an equity point of view, the dollar-yen rate has been
trapped in an unattractive range for some time, with little
sign of breaking out of its range, traders said.
   "There's a very interesting tug-of-war going on" with the
relationship between the markets, said Julian Jones, an
equity salesman at W.I. Carr, Sons &amp; Co. The battle increases
investors' attention to bond-yield movements.
   The market is unlikely to make any large movement until it
receives a firm indication of the currency's direction, Mr.
Jones said.
   Arbitrage and other types of index-linked buying,
meanwhile, is keeping the market from falling on weak
fundamentals, traders said. Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers
and Baring Securities were underlined as key players.
   A chief trader at a midsized Japanese securities firm
submitted that yesterday was the settlement date for pension
fund assessment, so firms would naturally push for a higher
result on the cash index, he said.
   Notable gainers included NTT, which advanced 70000 yen to
1.15 million yen ($456 to $7,494). According to a local news
service report, the company's chairman hinted that there is
potential for a gratis issue.
   Tokyo Steel rose 100 yen to 4950 yen, while Fuji Photo
Film gained 100 yen to 4390 yen, both boosted by
incentive-backed dealer buying, traders said.
   Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, which Tuesday disclosed news on a
new drug to be targeted for testing in the U.S., Soviet
Union, Japan and Western Europe, rose 70 yen to 2100 yen.
   In London, dealers said institutional investors generally
have stated that they're content with the profits they have
made so far during the second quarter and are awaiting the
start of the next quarter for any new investment.
   In addition, the running of the Royal Ascot horse race
kept many participants out of the market, dealers said, as
did a mediocre start to Wall Street and a dearth of major
U.K. corporate or economic news.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
1.5 points to 2371.2, off the midmorning best level of
2384.5, but well above the early morning minimum of 2369.6.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 4 points to
1903.4. Volume reached a sketchy 436.8 million shares,
compared with 408.3 million issues Tuesday.
   Among the major losers on the day was Imperial Chemical
Industries, Britain's largest chemical concern. The stock
fell 30 pence to #11.82 (52 cents to $20.37) on news that the
U.S. Commerce Department is suing eight corporations,
including an ICI unit, for allegedly polluting the coastal
waters off California.
   Also falling was drug maker Wellcome, which shed 34 pence
to 633 pence after an earnings downgrade by brokerage firm
S.G. Warburg, and worries over emerging competition for the
company's Retrovir drug used to combat the effects of the HIV
virus.
   Defense stocks continued to tailspin after the British
government Monday said it is canceling an order for 33
Tornado aircraft. British Aerospace lost 26 pence to 520
pence, GEC shed 11 pence to 197 pence, Rolls-Royce slipped 2
pence to 215 pence, while Vickers dropped a penny to 232
pence.
   Food and dairy group Unigate rose 7 pence to 312 pence,
after reporting a 5% rise for fiscal 1990 to #105.5 million,
exceeding market forecasts.
   Hambros, a banking and financial services concern,
increased 3 pence to 286 pence, after it reported a 10%
increase in pretax profit for the fiscal year.
   STC, a computers and electronics company, fell 19 pence to
239 pence, after issuing a half-year warning that profit
won't match market expectations.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Frankfurt, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Madrid; mixed in Paris, Brussels and Zurich,
and lower in Milan. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Also, shares closed higher in Sydney, Wellington, Hong
Kong, and Manila, were mixed in Singapore, and lower in Seoul
and Taipei.

   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. said it's
accepting bids for 14 of its biggest insolvent savings and
loan associations, with total assets of $39.8 billion.
   The thrifts range from City Savings Bank of Bedminster,
N.J., with assets of $8.5 billion, to Yorkridge-Calvert
Federal Savings Bank, Baltimore, with $540 million in assets.
Both S&amp;Ls were hurt by declining values of real estate in the
Northeast, the S&amp;L cleanup agency said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Selling the large thrifts is complicated and expensive for
the government. Most sales so far have left the thrifts' bad
investments in the hands of the RTC, so the buyers get huge
cash infusions to compensate for those assets.
   Other institutions up for bid in the latest round are:
Empire of America, Buffalo, N.Y., with $8.17 billion in
assets; Merabank, Phoenix, Ariz., $6.38 billion; Benjamin
Franklin Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Portland, Ore.,
$4.97 billion; Homeowners Savings Bank, Boston, $3.62
billion; Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Association, Huntington
Beach, Calif., $2.16 billion; Sooner Federal Savings
Association, Tulsa, Okla., $1.43 billion; Great American
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Oak Park, Ill., $1.01
billion.
   Also, City Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Birmingham,
Ala., $493 million; Arlington Heights Savings Association of
Illinois, $510 million; North Carolina Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association, Charlotte, N.C., $628 million; Midwest Federal
Savings Bank of Minot, N.D., $960 million; Capitol City
Federal Savings Association, Austin, Texas, $409 million.

   LONDON -- Net new investment in U.K. unit trusts totaled
#191.9 million ($330.3 million) in May, up more than 12 times
from #15.6 million in April, the Unit Trust Association said.
   The latest month's figure for the trusts, similar to
open-ended mutual funds, is down 12% from the #219.4 million
in net new investment recorded a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The value of funds under management by association members
rose 7.1% to #57.1 billion from #53.3 billion in April and
10% from #51.7 billion a year earlier.
   The association attributed the performance to the upturn
in the value of both the U.K. and other major world stock
markets during the month.
   Sales of unit trust shares to investors were up 13% to
#754 million in May from #666 million in April but were off
2.2% from #771 million in May 1989.
   Repurchases of the shares dropped 13% to #562 million in
May from #650 million in April but rose 1.8% from #552

   PARIS -- France's seasonally adjusted foreign trade
account for May showed a deficit of 5.68 billion francs
($1.01 billion) on a preliminary basis, after a revised April
deficit of 4.38 billion francs, which was initially estimated
at 4.31 billion francs, the National Customs Office said.
   The latest result was significantly worse than earlier
forecasts by Paris market economists, who generally expected
a deficit of 2.5 billion to three billion francs; the most
pessimistic estimate had been for a gap of as much as 4.5
billion francs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unadjusted results for May showed a deficit of 8.32
billion francs, after a revised April deficit of 3.09 billion
francs and a May 1989 deficit of 9.17 billion francs. The
unadjusted April 1990 deficit previously was estimated at
3.03 billion francs.
   The latest results brought France's adjusted trade deficit
for the first five months of this year to 12.49 billion
francs, a slight narrowing from the year-earlier deficit of
14.38 billion francs. This cumulative deficit was 19.68
billion francs on an unadjusted basis, compared with 22.49
billion francs a year earlier.

   Clorox to Purchase
   Household Items
   From Cyanamid

   OAKLAND, Calif. -- Clorox Co. is hoping to mop up on the
mix of bleach, disinfectant and insecticides.
   The Oakland-based concern said it will acquire the
household-products business of American Cyanamid Co. for $465
million. The purchase includes Cyanamid's well-known Pine Sol
cleaner and Combat insecticide labels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Clorox called the move a natural one that will allow it to
boost its already formidable presence in the $900 million
all-purpose cleanser market while providing it with a quick
foothold in the household insecticide business.
   The stock market seemed to agree. In composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Clorox common closed
at $43.875, up 37.5 cents.
   American Cyanamid of Wayne, N.J., makes medical,
agricultural and chemical products.
   Clorox has been considering entering the insecticide
market for a number of years but had been stymied by the
slow, costly and risky effort required to bring a new
insecticide to the sales counter. Combat, according to
Clorox, is currently the No. 2 brand in the $450 million a
year household insecticide market.
   Clorox said it expects the Cyanamid brands to boost
revenue about $235 million annually while adding
significantly to its international sales. It plans to pay for
the acquisition with about $400 million in short-term
borrowings, with the balance in cash.
   The company said debt and other costs associated with the
purchase is expected to dilute earnings by 30 cents to 40
cents a share during the first year, and ten cents a share
during the second year. By the second year, however, the
deal, after payment of financing costs, is "expected to
generate positive cash flow," the company said. For the
fiscal nine months, ended March 31, Clorox had profit of
$111.3 million, or $2.02 a share.
   The company's existing household products brands include
Clorox liquid bleach, Formula 409 spray cleaner and
Liquid-plumr drain opener. Clorox said it expects to make
significant cost savings by combining manufacturing and
marketing of its current labels with its newly acquired
Cyanamid brands. The purchase includes a Pine Sol and Combat
manufacturing plant in Mississippi that has 200 employees.

   OAKLAND, Calif. -- The financially beleaguered Oakland
Tribune said it was firing one-fourth of its 725-person work
force -- including 40% of its executive staff -- in an effort
to stay afloat. The announcement was made by Robert C.
Maynard, the newspaper's owner and president.
   The declining fortunes of the former Gannett Corp.
publication have been the subject of persistent speculation
for months. The paper, acquired by Mr. Maynard in 1983, has
been plagued by steadily slumping circulation and
advertising, in part from stiffening competition, in part
from Oakland's economic woes. The Tribune suffered yet
another blow when severe damage from the Oct. 17 earthquake
set back blossoming Oakland revitalization efforts, and
subsequently sapped advertising revenues.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Maynard, in a statement, said he has asked the
Tribune's various unions, representing 70% of its employees,
for their "participation in the restructuring."
   "It gives me no pleasure to think of the Tribune losing a
quarter of its employees. We are, after all, family," he
said.
   Mr. Maynard is a nationally known journalist and
syndicated columnist whose buy-out of the Tribune drew
considerable attention when it made him the first black owner
of a major metropolitan newspaper in the U.S. The paper, with
a circulation of 130,000, earlier this year won a Pulitzer
Prize for photography.

   Triton Energy Corp, Dallas, said its 59%-owned subsidiary,
Triton Europe PLC, has signed a conditional agreement to sell
its interests in the Alba oil field to Conoco U.K. Ltd. for
$61 million. The sale is subject to the consent of the U.K.'s
secretary of state for energy.
   Proceeds of the sale are to be used to retire $45 million
in long-term debt held by Triton Europe, the company said.
Assets to be sold consist of non-producing interests in 12
blocks in the North Sea, including the Alba oilfield.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sale comes against a backdrop of renewed interest in
the company by New Zealand financier Sir Ronald Brierly. Last
week Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., which is controlled by
Sir Ronald, bought 357,249 Triton common shares and raised
its stake to 11% from 9.3%.
   Industrial Equity has informed the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it may seek control of Triton, and has
antitrust clearance to acquire up to 14.9% of the company.
   Triton said it has not had any contact with Industrial
Equity, but noted that Sir Ronald has been a long-term
investor in Triton.

   Amax Inc., continuing the decentralization and
consolidation of its corporate structure, plans to cut about
40%, or 80 jobs, from its total corporate work force of 200
by year end.
   The company, which has interests in domestic energy and
gold production as well as aluminum and manufactured aluminum
products, plans to close its Greenwich, Conn., office by year
end. Amax, based in New York, moved its executive offices
there from Greenwich in 1988 and moved other jobs there
earlier this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An Amax spokesman said some of the Greenwich employees
would be transferred to New York. He said some functions
would be assigned to operating units and some jobs would be
eliminated.
   The spokesman said the company expects some cost savings
from the layoffs, but he didn't estimate them. He said he
believed the appropriate write-offs would be taken this year.
   Amax, which had 20,000 employees at the end of 1989, had a
56% drop in first quarter net income, to $50 million, or 57
cents a share, a result of the softening economy and sharply
lower aluminum prices. Sales fell 5.3% to $927.9 million.

   MOSCOW -- With Western corporations flocking here in
record numbers, the government last year changed the way
Soviets did business with the rest of the world.
   Instead of insisting that all imports and exports be
channeled through a few state-run agencies, the Kremlin ruled
that any Soviet organization could trade directly with
foreign partners.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was the sort of move many Western executives had pushed
for, in the hope of unlocking opportunities. For Soviet
managers, it meant liberation from an army of bureaucrats who
were inept at selling their products and who took months or
even years to buy needed machinery abroad.
   And in the 14 months since then, Soviet trade has indeed
undergone a revolution of sorts. The number of organizations
doing business abroad has leaped from a handful to more than
14,000. But these, alas, aren't the only far-reaching
changes. Far from bringing the hoped-for benefits, the Soviet
foreign-trade liberalization has left a trail of havoc and
confusion that is costing the Kremlin dearly.
   Dozens of Western companies, many of them longtime Soviet
trading partners, have been waiting months to be paid for
deliveries, and some have stopped shipments altogether. The
Soviet Union's reputation as a trustworthy partner has been
badly tarnished. Essential supplies of materials for Soviet
factories, ranging from cocoa to fertilizers, are starting to
dry up. And the Kremlin, already nearly overwhelmed with
domestic problems, now is struggling with a trade debacle it
can barely contain. Soviet officials estimate the total of
unpaid bills at $2 billion.
   Thus is the Soviet Union, just as it yearns to revitalize
its economy and link arms with the international world of
free enterprise, caught in a hard-currency squeeze of its own
making. Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov admitted as much to
the Soviet parliament recently, saying steps must be taken
"to bring back the confidence of our overseas partners." The
steps he announced were to increase some exports and cut
imports. But now world financial markets are abuzz with
rumors that the Soviets might use their gold reserves to ease
the currency crisis.
   The story of what went wrong with the overhaul of foreign
trade is an instructive tale of the "perestroika" on which
Mikhail Gorbachev and, to a considerable extent, his
erstwhile Cold War adversaries are depending. The trade
liberalization was well-intentioned and by most accounts long
overdue -- yet it came unstuck through a host of unforeseen
difficulties. Almost everyone, from government ministries to
the state banking system, seemingly was caught unprepared.
   Trading partners certainly were. For years, the Kremlin
had guaranteed all Soviet import and export transactions,
effectively making business in the U.S.S.R. a risk-free
undertaking. But from April 1, 1989, onward, the government
stopped vouching for transactions, forcing enterprises and
even government agencies to fend for themselves.
   M. Golodetz Ltd., a London-based trading organization that
has done business with the Russians since 1921, soon felt the
difference. Over the years, it had built up a close
relationship with its Soviet partners, selling chemicals for
the oil, automaking, construction and consumer industries.
"All our business here was on trust. When we concluded a deal
on the telephone from London or Moscow, we never worried
about signing the contract," says Jack Geller, managing
director of Golodetz. "There were occasions when the contract
was simply forgotten. We delivered and were paid."
   Other longtime traders report similar happily
unbureaucratic procedures. Most of them didn't bother with
expensive letters of credit or export insurance, receiving
cash on delivery or shortly thereafter. If the money was
late, a written reminder to the Soviet partner or the foreign
trade bank was enough to elicit the money -- and sometimes an
apology.
   All that has now changed. Mr. Geller says that starting in
mid-November, Golodetz didn't receive payments for products
it delivered, and its telexes went unanswered. The British
firm is still waiting for "very substantial" payments and has
ceased most of its shipments. Other executives and Western
bankers in Moscow say almost all sectors of the Soviet
economy have been affected, from chemicals to wool, computers
to machine tools.
   "I'm an eternal optimist, but the lack of payments does
hurt," Mr. Geller says.
   Soviet and Western officials point to several causes of
this mess. One thing that had happened was that the new
trading system rerouted the flow of Soviet hard currency.
Much of it began to flow not to state organizations but to
the thousands of other organizations selling abroad. But
managers of the exporting enterprises sometimes used their
hard-currency earnings to buy consumer goods for their
workers instead of essential supplies and machinery. So state
organizations continued to buy from abroad largely as before,
even though they sometimes didn't have the money to pay.
   Their money squeeze wasn't entirely unprecedented,
however. Unknown to most Western companies, the Soviet Union
had always juggled its cash-flow.
   Vladimir Sukharev, a former deputy government minister,
says that every summer Moscow tried to plan its foreign trade
for the next year based largely on calculations of expected
oil revenue. State agencies were then given instructions
about the volume of orders they could place abroad. But if
oil prices fell or the Soviet harvest didn't meet
expectations, plans had to be revised. "There were often
changes," Mr. Sukharev recalls. "Sometimes it meant selling
more gold or oil."
   When the government controlled all trade, Western
suppliers rarely noticed such fine-tuning. The new policy
brought the inefficiencies into the open, shifting the burden
of balancing the books onto Soviet enterprises and state
trading agencies.
   Soyuzkhimexport is one of the old-line state organizations
that couldn't cope with the change. It is a giant
government-run agency that used to buy virtually all the
chemicals, plastics and related products the U.S.S.R.
imported. Soyuzkhimexport still does the biggest share of
this chemical business. But it ran into trouble because the
government no longer automatically puts up the money for the
orders it places. Revenues from its exports don't nearly
cover the cost of what it imports.
   Soyuzkhimexport managers admit that they continued
ordering supplies for Soviet clients even though they didn't
have the money to pay the bills. The organization soon racked
up huge debts to its foreign suppliers, including such big
companies as Du Pont, West Germany's Hoechst and Holland's
Akzo. Many have now stopped deliveries, pending payment.
   "We still consider ourselves good partners," says Victor
Rudnez, Soyuzkhimexport's director. But "a big portion of the
cash flow has been taken away from the state," he says, going
now to factories that are in the export business themselves.
   Soviet state bankers don't buy this explanation, blaming
managerial failings instead. "They don't balance their ins
and outs correctly," says Yuri Poletaev, deputy chairman of
the state-owned Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs.
   But there are signs that the Soviet banking system itself
was overtaxed by the new policy. The Bank for Foreign
Economic Affairs suddenly had to deal with a 300-fold
increase in the number of foreign-trade accounts it oversees.
Lacking sophisticated computers or enough personnel, it
developed a bottleneck.
   "The narrowest place is the bank," contends Yuri Gurin, a
former state trading official who now heads an association of
Soviet machinery exporters. He says money from abroad can
sometimes take two months to be cleared.
   The bank had painstakingly built a reputation in the West
as a reliable partner. Its officials still insist they are
honoring all their obligations on Soviet sovereign debt. But
Western bankers and business people in Moscow say the Bank
for Foreign Economic Affairs, in trying to resolve the
payments problem, took some steps of its own that added to
the confusion.
   They say there is evidence the bank sought to juggle the
hard currency under its jurisdiction, taking money from one
account to pay the bills owed by another. When this merely
compounded the problem, it froze payment from all accounts,
and refused to issue crucial letters of credit that Western
suppliers were increasingly demanding. Then it tried to duck
out of the firing line.
   One American businessman says he tried to get an interview
at the bank together with his partner from a Soviet trade
organization that claimed it did have money in its account.
He says the bank told him in no uncertain terms that it would
see him but not his Soviet partner.
   Another time, a Soviet trade agency sent a messenger to
the bank with a letter requesting the release of funds in its
account. The bank turned the messenger away, refusing to
accept the letter, according to Western bankers in Moscow.
(The bank declines to comment.)
   Officials of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs finally
clammed up completely. At a recent business conference, angry
Western executives surrounded Tomas Alibegov, the bank's
deputy chairman, demanding to know why they hadn't been paid
for deliveries. Citing "clerical difficulties," Mr. Alibegov
gave out his business card and left in a hurry.
   The card proved little consolation. The bank had moved
earlier this year, so both the address and the phone number
on the card were wrong.
   Since then, the Soviet bank has been trying in vain to
raise fresh loans abroad. It has also tried to persuade
companies to turn money they are owed into credits, and in
this it has had more success.
   In theory, Soviet factories stood to gain the most from
the trade-policy changes. Before, they couldn't order abroad
directly but had to get the go-ahead from the ministry that
oversaw them, which in turn needed clearance from state
planning authorities. Orders could take months, and sometimes
the wrong kind of material arrived.
   Freed to buy and sell, many managers jumped at the chance.
But they have been hampered by a severe lack of experience.
One frustrated West German businessman based in Moscow says
that when he's not chasing unpaid bills, he spends a lot of
his time giving lessons in basic economics to would-be
partners. "It reminds me of the time I worked in Nigeria," he
says. "I give lessons. . . . I explain why the secretary
types and the lawyer doesn't."
   All these problems growing out of the sudden overhaul of
trade procedures might have resolved themselves after a
painful transition period. But the already-reeling system
took one too many blows last fall when Mr. Gorbachev, facing
growing worker unrest, suddenly announced plans to import the
equivalent of $16 billion in consumer goods. Government
planners scrambled to accommodate such a high-level political
decision, even though they had doubts the nation could
finance it.
   "The unexpected purchases caused big problems," says a
senior official in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Affairs,
adding that they are "one of the main reasons" for the
liquidity squeeze.
   Partly as a result of the emergency imports, which
included razor blades, soap, winter boots and clothes, the
Soviet Union posted a trade deficit last year for the first
time in 14 years. The purchases also caused enormous
headaches for the government trading agency that handled
them, known as Raznoexport.
   "The transport wasn't ready," says Pavel Vorobyov, a
Raznoexport official. "It all came at once, and we didn't
have enough people to reload and distribute it." The result
was a mad dash to find enough trucks and containers to pick
up the consignments at the Soviet border.
   So as the Soviet Union weighs new, more-radical steps
toward restructuring, its economy is still trying to digest
this somewhat-modest trade move made 14 months ago. And in
foreign trade, says Mr. Gurin of the machinery-exporters'
association, "at the moment, nothing works well because of
perestroika.

   Pose a Hurdle
   For Trump Deal

   A consortium of four foreign banks with a first mortgage
on Donald Trump's Trump Tower has emerged as a major
impediment to a $65 million loan package for the troubled
developer.
   The banks are unwilling to allow a second mortgage to be
placed on the property, according to people familiar with the
negotiations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The four banks are said to be Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi
Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Dresdner Bank. They purchased
portions of a $75 million loan issued by Chase Manhattan
Corp. to Mr. Trump. None of the four banks are believed to
own major portions of other loans to Mr. Trump, and,
therefore, would be otherwise unaffected if the bailout fell
through. Officials of the three Japanese banks and the West
German bank couldn't be reached.
   Chase has retained a portion of the loan and plans to meet
with the banks this morning to try to convince them that
"mutual cooperation is better for them, and without their
cooperation the deal doesn't work," said a person close to
the talks.
   Chase officials are also expected to learn whether the
banks are adamant or are merely posturing for better terms.
   Under a complicated bailout package prepared by Mr.
Trump's major creditors, the Trump Tower syndicate banks
would still receive interest payments and retain their first
mortgage, but they would have to share a second lien with the
rest of Mr. Trump's creditors.
   People close to the talks are said to believe that the
four syndicate banks apparently expect Chase or another U.S.
bank to buy out their share of the first mortgage loan.
Neither Chase nor any of Mr. Trump's other major U.S.
creditors -- Bankers Trust New York Corp., Citicorp or
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. -- are expected to be willing to
put up more money to keep the $65 million loan package alive.
   The syndicate banks for New York's Trump Tower have always
been seen as stumbling blocks to the bailout because they are
fully secured and would bear less risk than many other
creditors should Mr. Trump have to file for bankruptcy-law
protection.
   Meanwhile, participants in Citicorp's loans, which include
about 54 institutions from around the world, were said to
have inched closer to accepting the package. Many of those
loans aren't well-secured by Mr. Trump's assets, and the
Citicorp creditors are said to believe they are better off
trying to help Mr. Trump avoid bankruptcy court.
   Among the additional banks said to have agreed are Bank of
Ireland, Bank of Tokyo and Fuji Bank. Some banks from Europe,
Asia, North America and South America are still balking at
some of the terms of the proposal, people involved in the
negotiations said.
   The banks with better security are less willing to go
along with the proposal, and generally the Japanese banks
have less security and are, therefore, more amenable.
   For many of the banks that purchased portions of loans
originally issued to Mr. Trump by Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan, yesterday was the first day they could look at the
term sheet for the bailout and review it with their home
offices. Rough terms of the proposal were made available to
the banks 1 1/2 weeks ago.
   The larger creditors are essentially trying to convince
the smaller ones that it is better to have an orderly sale of
Mr. Trump's assets than allow a bankruptcy judge to decide
how they are disposed of. Also, some of the banks are said to
believe Mr. Trump will add value to his properties by
improving their performance in the coming year. People close
to the negotiations said about three-quarters of the 54
participants in Citicorp's loans had tentatively agreed to go
along with the deal.
   Mr. Trump's major creditors have offered the developer and
casino owner the $65 million loan and a suspension of
interest payments on $2 billion in bank debt. Mr. Trump would
cede equity in almost all of his properties to his creditors
and agree to sell many of them.
   Mr. Trump has until late Tuesday night to make a $43
million payment to Trump's Castle bondholders that he missed
Friday. After that, the property will go into default, which
could trigger defaults by other Trump properties.
   Still to be decided is whether the banks with the greatest
loan exposure to Mr. Trump, Citicorp and Bankers Trust, will
buy out some of Mr. Trump's recalcitrant smaller creditors.
   People close to the major banks said they were absolutely
unwilling to do so, but some of Mr. Trump's smaller creditors
said they doubted the big banks would allow the deal to fall
through if only one or two small creditors refused to approve
it.
   "The new strategy now is the smaller you are, the louder
you scream," said one person close to the negotiations.

   Moto Photo Inc., Dayton, Ohio, said that it expects to
report profit for the second quarter, but that the net income
will be lower than the year-earlier $201,018, or one cent a
share.
   The franchiser and owner of one-hour photo processing
stores said earnings from those operations improved in the
current quarter, compared with a year earlier. But it said
the year-ago results included a substantial profit from store
refranchising.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed mixed as a late round of
buying offset a midday sell-off that was triggered by a
report from the Federal Reserve that further damped hopes for
lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from
double-digit losses to finish with a gain of 1.74 at 2895.30,
and broader indexes also ended slightly higher.

   Despite the market's gyrations, trading activity remained
lackluster as concerns with rates and corporate earnings
continued to hang over investors. New York Stock Exchange
volume amounted to 137,420,000 shares, compared with
134,930,000 on Tuesday.
   "We really have a market that has no sustaining power up
and no sustaining power down, as indicated by the lack of
volume in either direction," said Jack Solomon, a technical
analyst at Bear, Stearns.
   After stocks failed to sustain opening gains, the market
skidded to session lows at midday after the Fed issued its
"beige book" summary of economic conditions. In the report,
the central bank said there had been "continued slow growth
in the economy with little change in the underlying inflation
rate."
   That assessment, arriving on the heels of some
better-than-expected economic reports for May, triggered a
sell-off in bonds that spilled into stocks. Long-term
Treasury issues showed losses in late trading of around 1/2
point, or $5 per $1,000 face amount.
   But stock prices rebounded near the close in a recovery
fueled by program buying related to stock-index arbitrage,
which went into effect after index futures contracts advanced
to sharp premiums to the cash indexes.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 0.63 to 359.10,
while the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.23
to 195.84 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 0.45 to
334.22. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the Big
Board, however, by 777 to 668.
   Rate-sensitive issues, especially those in the banking and
financial-services sectors, were hit with selling as the
outlook for rates turned for the worse. Citicorp went down
3/8 to 22 1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 1.4 million
shares, Federal National Mortgage Association declined 7/8 to
40 on 1.2 million shares, and American Express lost 5/8 to 30
1/8.
   Among regional banks, Banc One eased 5/8 to 28 7/8 as 1.9
million shares changed hands. An offering of 10 million
common shares of the bank holding company was made at $29 a
share. First Interstate Bancorp dropped 1 1/2 to 40 1/8, NCNB
lost 5/8 to 37 5/8, MNC Financial eased 3/8 to 14 1/4 and
SunTrust Banks fell 5/8 to 21 1/8.
   Chevron fell 3/4 to 70 7/8, but the market's late rebound
swept oil stocks higher even though oil prices extended a
decline in which the price of crude has reached 18-month
lows. Exxon rose 1/2 to 47 7/8, Texaco added 3/4 to 58, Mobil
gained 5/8 to 63, Amoco rose 1 3/4 to 53 1/2 and Unocal went
up 3/8 to 28 5/8.
   Upjohn rose 2 1/8 to 42 1/8 on 1.5 million shares amid
renewed speculation that the drug company could follow the
lead of others in the industry and seek a merger partner.
Schering-Plough was mentioned as a potential suitor for the
company, along with American Home Products, traders told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. Upjohn declined to
comment.
   Diversified Energies rose 1 1/4 to 32 1/2. The stock's
advance came after a block trade of 968,000 shares, amounting
to 6% of its shares outstanding and accounting for the bulk
of the stock's trading. The company said it believed Service
Corp. International, which owned a 7.1% stake as of early
April, sold the shares into "friendly hands."
   Consolidated Freightways fell 1 7/8 to 13 7/8. The company
said it would have to suspend dividend payments on its common
stock under provisions of an agreement for a new $860 million
line of credit, as well as amendments to existing bank
arrangements.
   Abbott Laboratories gained 1 to 40. A Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee recommended approval of a
test kit, produced by the company, to help physicians assess
growth or shrinkage of tumors in breast-cancer patients.
   Motorola went up 1 to 86 after a federal court granted a
stay of a lower-court decision that would have required the
company to stop selling a computer chip found to infringe on
Hitachi's patents. Separately, the company is expected to
disclose plans for a new satellite-communications system that
may permit expanded coverage by cellular-phone systems within
a few years.
   A set of dividend-related trades early in the session
swelled volume in Canadian Pacific, which added 1/8 to 18 on
2.1 million shares. The stock carries a dividend yield of
5.1% and goes ex-dividend today.
   Hilton Hotels rose 1 3/8 to 57 3/8 amid speculation that
the company may be interested in reacquiring the Trump Castle
hotel-casino in Atlantic City, N.J., from Donald Trump, who
has run into financial troubles. Hilton declined to comment.
   RJR Nabisco Holdings warrants fell 1/8 to 6 1/2. As
expected, the company and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts announced
that they are working on a refinancing that will involve
retiring "a significant amount" of the junk bonds issued in
its leveraged buy-out.
   AMP rose 3/8 to 51. Merrill Lynch named the issue, which
carries its highest investment ratings, as "focus stock of
the week." Among other things, the firm said it expects AMP's
earnings to begin improving before year end.
   Environmental Systems went up 3/8 to 14 after Brambles
Industries, the company's largest shareholder, said it hasn't
sold any part of its 23% interest and isn't planning to do
so. However, Brambles acknowledged that it had considered
reducing its stake.
   Contel, which filed for the sale of 14.5 million common
shares, declined 5/8 to 27 1/8. The company said it would use
the proceeds to reduce debt resulting from its Contel
Cellular unit's purchase of cellular properties in February.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.02
to 360.81. Volume totaled 13,890,000 shares.
   Fruit of the Loom dropped 7/8 to 12 1/4 on 1.9 million
shares. Chairman William Farley has been reducing his
holdings in the company since March; company officials
couldn't be reached for comment on the stock's latest round
of activity.
   Oneita Industries lost 1 1/4 to 8. Oppenheimer &amp; Co.,
citing weakness in the T-shirt industry, lowered its earnings
estimates for the fiscal year that ends in September and the
following year.
   Binks Manufacturing gained 2 1/4 to 42 although the
company denied it had received a takeover offer, as disclosed
by Kelso Management, a major shareholder. Kelso said the bid
was higher than the $45-a-share offer made earlier this year
by Illinois Tool Works.

   Heard on the Street:
   Big Board Stocks May Be Rising,
   But Exchange Seat Prices Languish

   NEW YORK -- Nobody got richer in a gold rush, the old saw
had it, than the guy selling shovels, and that also used to
be the case on the New York Stock Exchange.
   When stock prices soared in 1987, the price of a seat on
the Big Board also rose to a record, with one seat changing
hands at $1,150,000 -- triple its price of two years earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices again are close to record highs, but the
stock of the exchange itself, as measured by the most recent
seat sale price of $430,000, is languishing.
   To put things in perspective, it now costs 42% more to get
into the business of flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, which
charges $610,000 for a new franchise, than it does to buy a
seat on the country's premier stock exchange.
   "{The exchange} had a terrific franchise for years, but
{now} you have tremendous structural changes taking place,"
says George Bodine, managing director and head of stock
trading at Equitable Capital. "You're seeing more
fragmentation of the market. You're seeing more indexers
trying their utmost to reduce costs and transact
electronically."
   The price of a seat, like the price of a restaurant or any
other franchise, reflects its present and anticipated future
earning power. And the earning power of a seat is suffering.
   The 1,366 Big Board seats, in essence, convey a franchise
to buy and sell listed stocks on the exchange floor and to
charge a small commission to those who don't have access.
Seats are owned by brokerage firms, independent floor brokers
and the so-called specialists who each make a market in
certain assigned stocks.
   But institutions such as Equitable increasingly buy and
sell Big Board-listed stocks in so-called third and fourth
markets that circumvent the stock exchange. These include
Jefferies Group's Posit, a highly automated system that
trades baskets of stocks off the exchange; Instinet, an
electronic order matching system owned by Reuters Holdings;
and over-the-counter brokers such as Jefferies and Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities. Jefferies and Madoff perform
much the same function as Big Board members -- except that
neither belongs to the exchange.
   Thus, not only is the Big Board's volume down, but in the
first quarter of 1990, only 68% of all transactions in Big
Board-listed stocks were actually conducted on the exchange.
That was down from 85% in 1980 (though the Big Board still
handled last quarter more than 80% of the total shares traded
in its own stocks).
   One day this week, for example, First Boston Corp. traded
nearly one million shares of Big Board stocks with 12
different customers in London before the New York market
opened.
   In addition, commissions are far lower than they were
before deregulation. And with the rise of passive, or
index-oriented investing, the pressure is on for lower
commissions still.
   "The claim of indexers is that you're buying a commodity
and that you should pay a commodity rate," says Austin
George, head of equities at T. Rowe Price Associates.
   A traditional "limit order," or an order to buy stock at a
specific price, is handled manually and entails a big
commission. But such orders are on the wane. Passive
investors increasingly are buying stock over the Big Board's
automated order system known as DOT, which can handle baskets
of stocks at lower commissions. Or, they are buying a
surrogate of the stock market in the form of Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index futures, which trade on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. A seat on the Merc sold for $485,000
yesterday.
   In addition, brokerage firms, themselves under pressure to
cut costs, are squeezing independent floor brokers to charge
less for handling trades. For all of these reasons, owning a
seat is less lucrative than in the past.
   "The correlation between the market itself and seat prices
has broken down," says John Burke, an independent floor
broker or "two-dollar broker," as they are known in the
trade. "Guys on the floor have been under increasing pressure
to decrease what they charge. You have anemic volume and you
have a lot of trading" of Big Board stocks off the exchange.
   "If a two-dollar broker leases a seat," he adds, "he has
to make about $200,000 a year in gross to afford the lease
and expenses. The average commission has gotten to a level
where it's unprofitable" for some brokers.
   Although stock exchange spokesmen declined to comment for
this article, the exchange is clearly aware that their
franchise is under attack. Recently the Big Board unveiled
plans to introduce afterhours and, ultimately, 24 hour-a-day
trading.
   The notion that the exchange might succumb to an
electronic "black box" isn't new. Donald Stone, senior
partner in the specialist firm Lasker, Stone &amp; Stern and a
vice chairman of the exchange, says that when he hears talk
about the demise of the exchange and of specialists he feels
"like Tom Sawyer attending his own funeral."
   "I am still here," he notes. "I firmly believe that common
stocks are the investment of the future; the majority of
companies that went private in leveraged buy-outs will become
public again by re-selling stock." Mr. Stone's firm owns 8
seats.
   Another specialist, James Maguire, chairman of Henderson
Brothers Inc., says, "I am very bullish on seats." Henderson
Brothers recently bought an additional seat, taking their
total to 19. Like Mr. Stone, Mr. Maguire thinks that there
will be a boom in stock issuance in the 1990s and that the
resulting trades should spur "new highs in seat prices."
   Seats have in fact moved up from a five-year low in
February of $351,000. And at least in theory, the rental
market suggests that seats are a bargain. Investors can lease
a seat to a user, such as a floor broker, for about $80,000 a
year; at today's seat price, that amounts to a hefty annual
yield of 19%. But high yields often signal uncertain futures
-- and few bodies have a murkier future than the Big Board.
   "What is the value of a seat? You don't know what kind of
exchange will be there {in the future}," says the head of
equities at one Wall Street firm.
   The number of companies listed on the Big Board continues
to climb, rising to a record 1,721 in 1990, including some
newly listed high-profile stocks such as L.A. Gear. However,
overall volume this year, about 157 million shares a day, is
running about 17% below its 1987 peak.
   The Big Board's appeal is that, by matching the greatest
number of buyers and sellers, it can set prices efficiently.
Typically, orders are routed to a specialist's post; when
buyers of a stock outnumber sellers, or vice versa,
specialists step in to buy or sell stock, easing the
imbalance. But as commissions have fallen, specialists'
profits have dropped. As a result, investors say specialists
have become less willing to take risks.
   "The liquidity is gone and isn't going to come back," says
Fred Moran, a portfolio manager. He says he's particularly
incensed by one specialist because "if you go to this guy
with 5,000 shares," he'll declare an order imbalance and halt
the stock. Mr. Moran, who began his career with Goldman
Sachs, says that in the past "we were willing to take a hit
when commissions were 25 to 30 cents. At six cents a share
who wants to put capital on the line?"
   Mr. Bodine, of Equitable, says that "if there are two or
three buyers on the floor and I would be the fourth buyer, it
may be to my advantage if I can get the merchandise via
another source." Commissions in off-exchange trades generally
are lower.
   Even the exchange's proposal to expand into night trading
dilutes the value of a seat, some say, because the plan calls
for electronic trading, which would circumvent the
specialists. In effect, the afterhours exchange would become
one more competitor to the traditional, daytime Big Board.
   In fact, some say the very notion of a franchise in an
electronic market is anachronistic. Junius W. Peake, chairman
of the Peake/Ryerson Consulting Group, says exchanges
"shouldn't be clubs" with members, but public utilities that
grant wide access.
   "When the exchange talks about the possibility of an
electronic system, the value of a seat for a specialist or
anyone else goes way down," says a senior official at one
member firm. He adds: "I don't know that there's much
possibility for a rebound with all this volume moving off the
exchange."

   MANDELA ARRIVED in New York, beginning a 12-day visit to
eight U.S. cities.
   The South African black nationalist leader, who became one
of the world's most celebrated political prisoners, stopped
at a Brooklyn high school before a ticker-tape parade up
Broadway to City Hall. During a welcoming ceremony,
71-year-old Mandela called for a continuation of economic
sanctions against his homeland and offered thanks to his
American supporters. Mandela's U.S. tour will be marked by
festivities celebrating his Feb. 11 release from a South
African prison after 27 years of confinement. He also will be
meeting with U.S. business, religious and political leaders
to discuss anti-apartheid efforts.

   BUSH SUSPENDED talks with the PLO over an Arab assault on
Israel last month.
   The president halted the 18-month dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization because of its links to an
attempted terrorist attack May 30. Bush, who was reluctant to
call off U.S.-PLO discussions, declared that the U.S. is
ready to resume talks "any time" the PLO more clearly
condemns the seaborne assault on Israel and disciplines those
responsible. "We've given the PLO ample time to deal with
this issue," he said. Members of Congress said they welcomed
the decision.
   The PLO called the move "an unfriendly and provocative
act," but an aide to Israel's Shamir said the action "removed
a major obstacle" to peace.

   Gorbachev acknowledged that he could lose his Communist
Party post at a national congress in less than two weeks. His

   Campeau Posts Sharply Wider Net Loss
   Totaling $1.74 Billion for Jan. 31 Year

   TORONTO -- Campeau Corp. reported sharply wider losses for
fiscal 1990, mainly because of heavy financing costs and
write-downs related to its U.S. retailing operations, which
have sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Campeau had a net loss in the year ended Jan. 31 of $1.74
billion, or $39.59 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss
of $34 million, or $1.04 a share. The latest period includes
a loss of $104 million, or $2.34 a share, from discontinued
real-estate operations. There wasn't a similar charge in the
previous year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Campeau's U.S. retailing units, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., filed for Chapter 11
protection on Jan. 15.
   Campeau said it took non-cash charges in the latest year
of $1.63 billion. These included the write-down of $958
million of good will in Federated, $371 million in
depreciation and amortization, and $259 million from the
write-down of financing costs of mainly high-yield debt of
the companies now in Chapter 11.
   "It's very difficult to ascertain anything significant
from these numbers," said Harry Rannala, an analyst at McLean
McCarthy Ltd. in Toronto. He said Campeau's corporate health
depends more on its ability to restructure its debt than it
does on its operating performance.
   Campeau's consolidated revenue rose about 20% to $10.44
billion from $8.67 billion. The largest revenue gain came at
Ralphs Grocery Co., which posted a 39% sales rise to $2.56
billion. The Federated and Allied retailing units had
combined sales of $7.57 billion, up about 16% from the year
before.
   Campeau said the strong sales gains mainly resulted from
inclusion for the first time of Federated and Ralphs for a
full 12 months. The units, acquired in May 1988, contributed
just nine months of results to the year-earlier figures.
   But combined operating profit at Federated and Allied was
flat at $595 million. Campeau said operating retail margins
fell as a result of competitive price-cutting and higher
promotional and administrative costs. The company defined
operating profit as earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization.
   Operating profit at Ralphs Grocery rose almost 33% to $158
million. Ralphs isn't in bankruptcy proceedings, but is owned
by a Campeau unit that is in Chapter 11.
   Real-estate activities generated revenue of $309 million,
up 10.4%, while operating profit rose 4.3% to $144 million.
   Financing costs, consisting of interest and the
amortization of financing expense, amounted to $1.19 billion,
compared with $877 million a year earlier.
   Campeau also had a gain of $208 million in the latest year
from the disposal of various assets, including Allied's Ann
Taylor women's-wear division and several western properties.
In the previous year, asset disposals generated a gain of
$491 million.
   Analysts said investors are hoping that Campeau officials
provide specific information at the company's annual meeting,
scheduled for mid-July, about its plans to restructure debt
and raise cash by selling additional assets. Previously,
Campeau said that it plans to sell a "substantial portion" of
its real-estate assets to restructure its ailing finances.
   In March, Campeau stopped paying interest on its 184
million Canadian dollars (US$156.8 million) of 7 1/2%
debentures. It also stopped interest payments on $260 million
of convertible debentures held by Olympia &amp; York Developments
Ltd., which is closely held by Toronto's Reichmann family.
   Also in March, Campeau stopped paying interest on $480
million owed to Youngstown, Ohio, developer, Edward J.
DeBartolo Corp., and $225 million owed to Olympia &amp; York.

   Soviet `Reforms' Sow More Chaos

   MOSCOW -- Mr. Gorbachev returned from his North American
tour, if not triumphant, at least with a fair amount of
success, to face his kitchen problems: how to feed the
people, how to fight inflation, how to deal with all sorts of
opposition, and not least, how to come to terms with Boris
Yeltsin, who had just acquired new power as leader of the
Russian Republic.
   Even before Mr. Gorbachev left for America, Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov had to confront a hostile Supreme Soviet when
he submitted his plans for market-type economic reforms. The
population reacted feverishly to the prospect of the doubling
of food prices and considerable rises in other prices and
tariffs. Is it not a strange "market" where the government
declares that it intends to raise meat prices exactly 2.3
times and fish prices 2.5 times? The immediate effect was
catastrophic. There was panic and a run on the shops,
particularly in Moscow, where no rationing had been
introduced before (most big Soviet cities have been using
some form of rationing for months or years).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Longer-term results are the progressive deterioration of
the national distribution channels and the spreading of
economic (and political) separatism. Parliaments in Ukraine
and Byelorussia have adopted resolutions requiring their
explicit agreement to any rise in prices. Moscow felt
compelled to introduce defensive measures preventing
residents of nearby areas from shopping in the capital. Now
the Moscow authorities are trying to set up some form of
special trade area with the regions of Central Russia. The
new radical mayor of Leningrad, law professor Anatoly
Sobchak, is talking about special arrangements with the
Baltic republics, which are formulating plans to introduce
their own local currencies.
   Two elements of the former political and economic
structure created by Stalinist and post-Stalinist regimes are
making their devastating effects felt. One is totalitarian
centralization, with the lack of any clear-cut and
democratically accepted division of jurisdictions among the
Union government, the constituent republics and the local
authorities. The other is uncertainty over property rights,
with everything belonging to the state and without specific,
responsible owners of the "socialist," or "people's,"
property.
   These create a source of conflict among different tiers of
authority, and between central agencies running enterprises
and the newly elected local soviets. A specific problem is
the property of the Communist Party: In the Baltic republics
it is contested by opposing party factions; in many other
areas people have started to grumble about the legality of
this huge wealth. The issue seems to have precipitated an
open conflict between the Leningrad party and the local
soviet's authorities.
   As usual, the government program of marketization has been
severely criticized both from the right and from the left.
Critics from both camps, meanwhile, are trying to exploit
popular discontent and fears of more inflation and
unemployment. Together they have managed to run down the
central government's rating in popular polls to the lowest
level ever recorded.
   The criticism of the program is well-founded. Much of it
looks half-hearted and irresolute. Take the all-important
problem of private property and entrepreneurship. The program
contains references to privatization of some branches of the
economy: A considerable part of small- and even medium-size
enterprises in trade, services and public catering are
intended to be leased or sold to individual or family owners.
Another source of private capital is to be provided by a more
extensive effort to attract foreign capital.
   On the other hand, consider this quote from an interview
with the architect of the reform, Leonid Abalkin: "We are
against the development of private property with the use of
hired labor. This is unacceptable and incompatible with the
socialist choice made by this country."
   This statement is in flagrant conflict both with the
program itself and with evolving public sentiment. How can a
growing and successful enterprise be run without hired labor?
If it is not allowed to hire hands it is doomed to
stagnation. Another strong deterrent to entrepreneurship will
be the new tax law, which raises the highest personal income
tax rate to 60% from 13%.
   After a few stormy sessions, the Supreme Soviet closed its
doors for a summer recess, leaving behind a toothless and
indefinite resolution on the switch to a "regulated market."
To be sure, it accepted the principle of markets. But it sent
the measure back to the government with restrictions and
qualifications, and then relegated the whole problem for
consideration by about three dozen members of the parliaments
of constitutent and autonomous republics. As a report in
Izvestia put it: "Only a blind person will not notice that
this document abounds in contradictions and wishfulness."
   Any steps toward a market economy are being postponed at
least until autumn, or more probably, until next year.
Meanwhile, with strictly controlled and administratively
fixed prices, the last remnants of the legitimate
distribution sector, both wholesale and retail, are
disappearing. In their place, gray and black markets are
growing.
   Optimists would say, nevertheless, that the Supreme Soviet
economic program is a breakthrough to some new and rational
economic structure. Pessimists would reply that the decision
pays only lip service to that aim. That brings to mind a
saying: Pessimists are nothing but well-informed optimists.
The best we can do is hope that this saying is not applicable
in this particular case.

   Pathe Confident
   On Bid for MGM,
   Despite Reports

   Pathe Communications Corp., amid a flurry of reports that
its $1.2 billion bid for MGM/UA Communications Co. is on the
brink of collapse, said it remains confident it will complete
the acquisition of the movie studio.
   However, yesterday, Pathe's negotiations with its chief
financial backer in the bid, Time Warner Inc., appeared to be
deadlocked. So far, Time Warner has refused to alter the
terms under which it agreed to finance about half of Pathe's
$20-a-share offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Edmund Hamburger, general counsel to Pathe, said Pathe has
asked MGM/UA to extend the original deadline of June 23 and
the request is "under discussion."
   Officials of Time Warner say they continue to hope the
Pathe-MGM/UA deal goes through and believe that it would be a
good one for Time Warner. "We haven't changed our position,"
one company executive said.
   Yesterday, MGM/UA shares closed at $16.625, off 50 cents,
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. A
spokesman for MGM/UA said: "The negotiations are proceeding.
Our position is {that} nothing has changed."
   Time Warner had said that Pathe itself must come up with
$450 million in equity as part of the offer. Pathe also must
come up with another $150 million in equity, rather than
debt, from outside parties. Time Warner officials say they
aren't prepared to put up any equity themselves or provide
any other kind of financing beyond the existing agreement.
   But Pathe, headed by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti,
has had trouble raising the equity and has asked Time Warner
to ease the equity requirements, a request that Time Warner
has rejected.
   Mr. Hamburger said Pathe is now arguing that a loan to
Pathe from Comfinance S.A., a Luxembourg-based affiliate of
Mr. Parretti, should be considered equity because the terms
allow it to be repaid in Pathe stock. Comfinance has agreed
to provide Pathe with $368 million it raised through a
combination of bank loans and asset sales. "We are arguing
that we meet the original terms of Time Warner," said Mr.
Hamburger.
   Pathe already has deposited $200 million in cash toward
the acquisition. In the event that the deal fell through,
that amount would be converted into 10 million shares, at $20
each, and held in an escrow account until any litigation was
resolved.
   A second issue still under negotiation between Time Warner
and Pathe is additional financing for MGM/UA movie
production. Warner had asked Pathe to provide $200 million
for that purpose. A Pathe spokesman, Craig Parsons, said
Pathe has secured a bank credit line of $125 million toward
movie production. "Pathe is saying we think that is
sufficient," Mr. Parsons said.
   Privately, some Time Warner officials acknowledge that the
odds of Pathe completing the transaction on acceptable terms
appear to be diminishing. The snags also leave some analysts
on Wall Street doubting that the MGM/UA acquisition will ever
be completed.
   "I've always thought it was an iffy deal. That's going to
be my attitude until the ink is dry," said Alan Kassen of
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   "From the start," added analyst John Reidy of Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., "the only thing that gave this
deal credibility was the entrance of Time Warner onto the
scene, and {now} even they have some constraints as to what
they're willing to do."
   The question, Mr. Reidy said, is what other deep-pockets
buyer could emerge should the Pathe bid falter. Because an
earlier offer last year from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
didn't work out, that company is an unlikely bidder, he
added.
   Last October, MGM/UA terminated a $1.5 billion agreement
to be acquired by Qintex Australia Ltd. after Qintex failed
to deliver a $50 million letter of credit.

   Young, Urban Professionals
   Work to Show New York Cares

   YUPPIE, THE 1980'S ACRONYM for "young urban professional,"
became a synonym for greedy strivers. Like most blanket
condemnations, it was wrong.
   A few typical young New York professionals banded together
in 1985 to figure out how busy people with little free time
could do volunteer work. Today, New York Cares, the
organization they formed, sends hundreds of volunteers to
staff soup kitchens, visit the elderly, haul debris at
low-cost housing sites, look after AIDS sufferers and crack
babies, tutor children, and pitch in on the myriad thankless
tasks imposed by inner-city problems.
   Real estate analyst Andrea Gittings was one of the
original four, along with Andrew Luger, now an assistant U.S.
attorney, and Jeanne Straus, who works in her family's
broadcasting business. Ms. Gittings says the idea sprang from
seeing the "people we had to step over on the way to work."
By 1988, the four had an organization, a full-time director
and a mailing address.
   The nerve center of New York Cares is a four-room walk-up
a block from Bloomingdale's, which executive director Kenneth
Adams rents for only $6,000 a year. ("The landlady like
volunteers," he says.) Besides Mr. Adams, the overhead is his
staff of three. Everything else, from paint and furniture to
computers and legal services, is donated. Working with a 1990
budget of less than $200,000, Mr. Adams runs an army of 3,000
volunteers, about 700 of them working at any one time on one
of his 60-odd "team projects." Fifty to 70 of his young
volunteers keep track of the rest, others run orientation
sessions for the approximately 130 new volunteers that show
up each month.
   The disparity between the size of Mr. Adams's army and the
number at work is dictated by the nature of New York Cares.
All are young, 25 to 35, most are single, and all have
full-time jobs. The time they give comes after (or before)
regular jobs. For some, this is once a week, for others once
a month, and some at even longer intervals.
   The wide variety of chores is an advantage. Volunteers
stand ready to give time but are not sure what jobs they can
handle. One young woman, for instance, explained that she
started taking city children on outings but discovered "I
couldn't stand kids." Now she hauls trash from housing-rehab
sites. "You'd be surprised," she says, "at the satisfaction
you can get when you see a dumpster finally fill up."
   The recruiting, all word of mouth, produces remarkably
durable connections. Founder Gittings, for example, still
puts in 15 hours a week as president and treasurer of New
York Cares and finds time to visit a disabled man each week.
Ms. Straus, a director, does the same for a house-bound
woman. Mr. Luger gave up the New York Cares presidency when
he went into public service but is still on the board and
manages one shut-in visit a week.
   Mr. Adams, a 30-year-old, Manhattan-born graduate of
Vermont's Middlebury College, passed up a shot at Yale's
management school to take on his job at New York Cares. ("My
mother still wonders.") A slender, intense embodiment of a
Central Casting yuppie, he sees New York Cares developing
into a Peace Corps for the Big Apple. He thinks it could
serve as a model for a national network of volunteer bands of
young professionals. (Two copies have been created in Atlanta
and Washington, D.C.) Now he is helping New York corporations
organize in-house volunteer organizations.
   Mr. Adams's only concern is the same one Ms. Gittings
remembers. "The volunteers are out there. Our nightmare is we
could be overwhelmed by their numbers."

   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee approved legislation
that would expand the Securities and Exchange Commission's
power to impose fines on individuals and firms that violate
securities laws.
   The telecommunications and finance panel also passed a
bill aimed at curbing penny-stock fraud, after substantially
changing provisions opposed by the SEC and the securities
industry. Both bills now move to the full Energy and Commerce
Committee.

   The civil-penalties bill, identical in most respects to
legislation recently passed by the Senate Banking Committee,
would give the SEC power to impose monetary penalties for
offenses other than insider trading, for which the agency
currently has fining power. The House bill also gives the SEC
the power to issue cease-and-desist orders to enforce the
securities laws. But compared with the Senate bill, the House
bill includes additional protections for parties subject to
such orders to assure the target's right to due process.
   In the penny-stock bill, the House subcommittee softened a
provision that would have required the creation of an
electronic system to disseminate penny-stock quotes. The
revised bill directs the SEC to adopt rules to improve
dissemination of penny-stock quotes. The revised bill also
directs the SEC to adopt rules providing for increased
disclosure of information about companies that sell penny
stocks to the public.
   Moreover, a provision in the bill that would have banned
so-called blind pools and blank-check offerings was softened
to require the SEC only to increase disclosure requirements
for such offerings. In both types of offerings, the issuers
don't have a business plan or specific assets.

   N.V. Philips Unveils First Phase of Plan
   To Scale Back Its Computer Operations
   ----

   N.V. Philips announced the first stage of a plan to
retrench its computer operations and said it hopes to end
losses in the division by the end of 1991.
   Retreating from its efforts to be a technology leader in
minicomputers, the Dutch electronics company said it plans to
eliminate 210 jobs at its data systems product group in
Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. The product group, which makes
minicomputers and related products and employs 2,100 people
world-wide, will "drastically" reduce efforts to develop
systems using its own hardware technology, Philips said.
Instead, the unit is to focus on putting together computer
systems based on industry standards and on tailoring systems
for specific industry applications. Philips's minicomputer
business specializes in systems for banks, insurers and
government agencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The moves announced yesterday don't affect the company's
personal computer product group, whose main plant is in
Montreal, but a spokesman said further moves to restructure
the computer division would be announced later. Philips said
the restructuring is aimed at "drastically reducing costs"
and making "strategic choices" about which products it will
offer.
   Some analysts estimate that losses at Philips's computer
division totaled 150 million guilders ($80 million) in the
first quarter of 1990. A Philips spokesman yesterday would
say only that the losses are running at an annual rate in the
"hundreds of millions of guilders." The company, whose
overall net profit totaled 1.37 billion guilders in 1989,
warned last week that its 1990 results would be "very low,"
reflecting losses in the computer and semiconductor divisions
and high restructuring costs.
   Analysts called yesterday's announcement a step in the
right direction. "It's very encouraging that they are taking
the knife {to the computer division} in this fashion," said
Laurence Heyworth, an analyst at London merchant bank Robert
Fleming &amp; Co.
   Arjen Los of County NatWest Securities Ltd. in London said
the moves are a sign that Philips is putting more emphasis on
offering customers what they want rather than trying to
impose its own technology on the market. "If you can't be a
leader, you have to look for the niches and be market-driven"
rather than technology-driven, Mr. Los said.
   But he said investors are still waiting to hear Philips's
overall strategy for the computer division. Philips's new
chairman, Jan Timmer, is expected to address that question at
a shareholders meeting in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, July 2.
Mr. Timmer, whose rapid clean-up of the consumer electronics
division in the late 1980s earned him the nickname "Hurricane
Gilbert," is taking over from Cornelis van der Klugt, who was
forced to resign last month after the company said
first-quarter results tumbled unexpectedly.
   Mr. Los speculated that Philips might try to repair its
computer division enough to make it an attractive candidate
for a sale or a merger with a stronger rival. Only last week,
Philips and Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. of Italy announced that
they had ended talks on possible cooperation in the computer
business. Some industry executives said the talks failed
partly because Olivetti decided that fixing Philips's
computer division would be too costly.
   Many analysts have long argued that Philips is too small
in computers to survive on its own. Dataquest Europe, a
consulting firm, ranked Philips as the 12th largest personal
computer company in Europe last year, with a market share of
2.2%. IDC Nederland estimates the computer division's sales,
including software and peripheral equipment, at $1.7 billion
a year. The division employs about 15,500 people, out of a
company total of nearly 300,000.

   NEW YORK -- A federal grand jury indicted a
gasoline-distribution unit of Getty Petroleum Corp. and one
of the unit's executives for tax evasion and conspiracy.
   Getty Petroleum, a Jericho, N.Y., independent gasoline
marketer, said Tuesday that the office of U.S. Attorney
Andrew Maloney in Brooklyn had notified the company that it
was seeking the indictment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The four-count indictment names as defendants Getty
Terminals Corp. and William Rea, manager of the unit's Supply
and Trading department, primarily responsible for gasoline
sales.
   Also charged were John Pabone, president and owner of J&amp;J
Petroleum Inc., a Staten Island, N.Y., gasoline distributor;
and John Quock, president and owner of Tun Yung Oil Corp. and
Westwind Petroleum Inc., both New York gasoline distributors.
   A separate indictment issued yesterday charges two
brothers, Richard and Robert Kennon, with filing false
excise-tax returns and conspiracy. The Kennons are owners
and, respectively, president and vice president of three
gasoline companies: Jenny Oil Corp., Pelham, N.Y., and Oil
City Enterprises Inc. and Mount Vernon Energy Terminals Inc.,
both in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
   The indictments are part of what the Justice Department
called a continuing "multi-agency investigation into an
estimated $1 billion annual nationwide loss" of federal
gasoline and diesel excise taxes because of fraud in gasoline
wholesaling.
   Getty Terminals said it is "outraged" about the
indictment, which charges it with evading $946,000 of taxes
in 1985. The charges are "completely baseless," the company
said, and it plans a vigorous defense for itself and Mr. Rea,
who couldn't be reached for comment.
   Messrs. Quock, Pabone and Kennon couldn't be reached.
